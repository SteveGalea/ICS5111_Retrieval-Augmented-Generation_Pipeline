{"summary": "eukaryotic viruses have evolved a variety of translational control strategies to facilitate expression of downstream open reading frames (ORFs) on polycistronic mRNAs. these include leaky scanning of 40S ribosomal subunits past the most 5\u2032 AUG [2], the de novo recruitment of ribosomes to intercistronic internal ribosomal entry sites. expression of the downstream ORF by termination-reinitiation requires a stretch of mRNA (between 69 and 87 nt in length) upstream of the stop codon of the first ORF (termed the termination upstream ribosome binding site or TURBS) within the TURBS, two essential sequence motifs (motifs 1 and 2) have been described. the features identified in caliciviral TURBS suggest a model for termination-reinitiation in which post-termination 40S subunits are tethered to the mRNA through interactions between the mRNA (through motif 1) and 18S rRNA, initiation factors are recruited and the AUG restart codon located. the TURBS is not highly active as an IRES and 40S subunit recruitment probably requires high local 40S subunit concentrations. caliciviral TURBS contain stretches of non-essential bases between motifs 1 and 2, all of the BM2 TURBS appears to be required for function perhaps due to its shorter length. evidence is provided, from oligonucleotide targeting and from expression studies in yeast cells, to support the hypothesis that a close spacing between the stop and BM2 start codons is not critical. plasmids generated by site-directed mutagenesis of p2luc-BM2wt or p2luc-BM2-204. insertion of a PCR fragment comprising the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES downstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. the resulting plasmid contains a T7 promoter located 25 nt upstream of the CrPV IRES. in vitro transcription and translation p2luc-BM2 reporter plasmids were linearised with HpaI and capped run-off transcripts generated using T7 RNA polymerase. messenger RNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol/chloroform (11 v/v) followed by ethanol precipitation. the relative abundance of products on the gels was determined by direct measurement of [35S]-methionine incorporation using a Packard Instant Imager 2024. purified eIF3 was a kind gift of Dr. Chris Fraser. for each experiment three transformants cultivated under the same conditions were assayed. plasmid was generated by digestion of p2luc-BM2wt with PstI and NheI. insertion of a PCR fragment comprising the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES downstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. translation starts on an alanine codon within the inserted CrPV fragment, resulting in an N-terminal extension to rluc. in vitro transcription and translation p2luc-BM2 reporter plasmids were linearised with HpaI and capped run-off transcripts generated using T7 RNA polymerase. messenger RNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol/chloroform (11 v/v) followed by ethanol precipitation. the eluate was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, the mRNA resuspended in water. proteins and cell extracts Purified eIF3 was a kind gift of Dr. Chris Fraser. reporter gene assay in yeast cells pAC99 reporter plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Y349. p2luc-BM2-204 contains an in-frame stop codon immediately upstream of the TURBS. deletion of any part of the minimal required region led to strong inhibition of BM2fluc synthesis. insertion of 6 nt back into the 6.6 deletion mutant restored BM2 synthesis. the minimum 45 nt TURBS region is split into sequence-specific and sequence-independent elements. the sequence towards the 5\u2032 end of the minimal region is important in base-specific interactions. the 3\u2032 end of the TURBS may act solely as a spacer. motif 1 is underlined in BM2-204. targeting the 18S rRNA:mRNA interaction using antisense oligonucleotides Termination-reinitiation on the BM2 ORF is likely to be dependent on interactions between the influenza B segment 7 RNA and helix 26 of the 18S rRNA. antisense 2-O-methyl oligonucleotides were synthesised that would target either the loop of helix 26 of the 18S rRNA. an antisense RNA oligonucleotide specifically inhibits the termination-reinitiation process. an antisense RNA oligonucleotide specifically inhibits the BM2 termination-reinitiation process. the primary sequence of the oligo is shown. substitution mutations reduced frequency of termination-reinitiation events. effect of increasing complementarity between motif 1 and 18S rRNA helix 26. rRNAs were translated and analysed as in the legend to Figure 1. p2luc-BM2wt and p2luc-BM2Gtx sequences in vicinity of motif 1 are shown. the 7 nt core of motif 1 (bold italics in p2luc-BM2wt) was substituted for nucleotides complementary to the region of 18S rRNA where the Gtx IRES is believed to bind. hexanucleotide AUGCGA were looped in as a negative control. motif 1 mutation was unable to support termination-reinitiation, presumably due to the abolition of mRNA:rRNA base pairing. in the second set of constructs, the bases downstream of the wild-type AUGGGA sequence were substituted to generate one or two extra copies of the motif. termination-reinitiation was found to be inhibited in either mutant and to a similar extent as mutants in which a single nucleotide substitution was present to abolish 18S rRNA base pairing. these results suggest that motif 1 and the Gtx IRES element cannot functionally replace each other. motif 1 was inserted into the M1 sequence 233 nt upstream of the start codon of BM2fluc. the plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Y349. -galactosidase and luciferase assays were carried out. mRNAs mutated to make motif 1 complementary to yeast 18S rRNA are underlined. p values were determined by one-tailed t-test and are indicated on the figure. nucleotides at \u20133 and +4 relative to the BM2fluc AUG were maintained to control for context effects of the start codon. reinitiation occurred efficiently when the stop codon was moved up to 24 nt downstream of its original placement but was abolished when the stop was moved further. the placement of the 40S subunit relative to the TURBS, post-termination, is quite critical. a series of mRNAs were prepared in which the original BM2fluc start codon was mutated to AGC and new AUG restart codons inserted independently at +12, +24, +36, +48 and +63 nt. however, the reinitiation product band seemed less sharp and more diffuse with the +48 and +63 mRNAs. this suggested the possibility that reinitiation might be occurring at two sites. the codon immediately 5\u2032 of the native reinitiation site is denoted -1, the reinitiation site is shown as +1. messenger RNAs derived from these plasmids were translated and analysed as above. the putative AUA reinitiation product is marked with an asterisk. reinitiation efficiency in the RHDV system was only slightly compromised if the restart codon was moved one codon upstream [19] this observation suggests that reinitiation certainly occurs at these downstream sites. in this particular experiment there is much more downstream cistron product from the displaced AUG than product from the putative -1 AUA reinitiation site, which was only visible on the autoradiogram. reinitiation at the -1 AUA can occur when the first AUG is moved 63 nt downstream. we examined this by exploiting the dependence of ribosomal scanning on eIF4G. the mRNAs were modified so that translation of the upstream M1 ORF was driven by the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES. two AUG codons were present, one at +63 and the other at either the +1 (wild-type) or -1 position. this precedence was maintained even when the stop codon was moved 12 codons downstream. the strongly preferred site for reinitiation is an AUG codon just downstream of the TURBS. eIF3 specifically stimulated synthesis of the BM2fluc reinitiation product with all of the mRNAs tested. the addition of an unrelated, similarly purified protein had no effect on reinitiation in any of the RNAs described above. eIF3 stimulates reinitiation on the BM2 ORF. in mfold 1 the 18S complementary region is sequestered in a base-paired region of stem 2. mfold 1 is shown with motif 1 shown in red, termination-reinitiation overlap shown in cyan and the sequences likely to be occupied by a ribosome terminating at the M1 ORF are 3\u2032 of the purple line. mfold 2 (stem 2) is the biologically relevant fold. mutations created were of either 2 or 3 nt to control for context effects on the BM2 AUG. substitution of bases in arm 1 abolished termination-reinitiation. however substitution of bases at the bottom of arm 2 had little effect on BM2fluc synthesis relative to the BM2-204 control. no restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed in the pseudowild-type construct. the structure presented for mfold 2 would still be able to form when the ribosome has translated through the upstream ORF and is in the process of termination. we tested this structure in the same way by introducing destabilising mutations independently in both arms. the minimum sequence requirement for termination-reinitiation of BM2 (45 nt; [11]) is shorter than that documented in the caliciviruses (69 and 87 nt; [15], [17], [19]). to test this, we introduced 6 nt deletions throughout the length of the sequence upstream of the termination codon. replacement of nucleotides into the 6.4 deletion mutant had no effect with the first of the mutants (6.4r1) but some recovery was observed in the second of these mutants (6.4r2). insertion of 6 nt back into the 6.6 deletion mutant fully restored BM2 synthesis in both cases (Figure 1B). translations of the 6 nt deletion mutants (del) and the replacement mutants (r1 and r2) were performed in parallel with the 204 and ps controls, resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualised by autoradiography. targeting the 18S rRNA:mRNA interaction using antisense oligonucleotides Termination-reinitiation on the BM2 ORF is likely to be dependent on interactions between the influenza B segment 7 RNA and helix 26 the 80S ribosome will strip annealed AONs from the mRNA as it translates through the TURBS. but both the upstream and motif 1 complementary AONs will be able to re-anneal once the ribosome reaches the UAA UG. however, it is possible that any effect of the downstream oligo is masked due to it being unable to reanneal in the presence of the terminating ribosome. termination-reinitiation site (UAA UG) is shown, with the A residue at the start of the TURBS underlined. p2luc-BM2wt RNA was translated as above in the presence of increasing AON concentrations as indicated above each autoradiograph. p2luc-BM2wt and p2luc-BM2Gtx sequences in vicinity of motif 1 are shown, and their base pairing to 18S rRNA indicated. p2luc-BM2wt and p2luc-BM2Gtx sequences in the vicinity of motif 1 were substituted for nucleotides complementary to the region where the Gtx IRES is believed to bind. IRES and helix 26 of the 18S rRNA [28]\u2013[30], although with the arm of the helix [31] rather than the apical loop. control constructs were also generated in which one or two copies of the hexanucleotide AUGCGA were looped in as a negative control. in vitro translations revealed that none of the mutations had a stimulatory effect on reinitiation on the BM2 ORF. mRNA:18S rRNA interactions in ribosome tethering inhibit termination-reinitiation in yeast cells. it is possible that these mutations may affect TURBS structure or interaction with other translational components, like eIF3 [17]. luciferase is synthesised by cap-dependent translation, whereas firefly luciferase should only be synthesised following reinitiation on the BM2fluc ORF. motif 1 homologue was fully complementary to yeast 18S rRNA partner. termination-reinitiation gives rise to synthesis of -galactosidase (-gal) termination-reinitiation gives rise to the synthesis of firefly luciferase (fluc) a series of mRNAs were prepared in which the UAA UG overlap was moved downstream en masse. the distance between the stop and start codons was conserved but the ribosome would terminate at varying distances relative to the TURBS. a series of control mRNAs were also examined in which the stop codon alone was shifted downstream of the BM2 start codon. the rlucM1/BM2fluc overlap window was changed from UAA UG to CAACU. the UAA UG sequence reintroduced at +12, +24, +36, +48 or +63 nt downstream preserving both the initiation codon and stop codon context. mRNAs derived from these plasmids were translated and analysed as above. BM2fluc start codon reintroduced at +12,+24, +36, +48 or +63 nt. the codon immediately 5\u2032 of the native reinitiation site is denoted -1, the reinitiation site is shown as +1. messenger RNAs derived from these plasmids were translated. the results showed that the efficiency of reinitiation at an AUG in the -1 position was similar to when it was in the normal (+1) position. the results showed that the efficiency of reinitiation at an AUG in the -1 position was similar to when it was in the normal (+1) position. reinitiation occurs when the first AUG is moved 63 nt downstream. mRNAs were modified so that translation of the upstream ORF was driven by the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES, which does not require eIF4G for function. translations were performed in the absence or presence of dominant-negative eIF4A (eIF4A R362Q [35] to inhibit the activity of any residual eIF4G that had escaped depletion eIF4G-depleted RRL was translated efficiently in both control and depleted RRL. depletion of eIF4G had no effect on the reinitiation efficiency in either the CrPV-BM2wt or CrPV-BM2start +63 mRNAs. this suggests that the reinitiation site can be located in a scanning-independent manner. exogenous eIF3 specifically stimulated synthesis of the BM2fluc reinitiation product with all of the mRNAs tested. the addition of an unrelated, similarly purified protein had no effect on reinitiation in any of the mRNAs described above. eIF3 stimulates reinitiation on the BM2 ORF. messenger RNAs derived from these plasmids were translated and analysed as detailed in the legend to Figure 1. termination-reinitiation on the BM2 ORF may be dependent on RNA secondary structures in the TURBS Given the likely importance of the interaction between motif 1 and 18S rRNA, we previously carried out RNA structure mapping and minimal free energy predictions. the mfold 2 structure is shown with motif 1, the termination-reinitiation overlap, and the ribosome protected region marked as above. mfold 2 is the biologically relevant fold, and that destabilisation of the central stem of mfold 1 (stem 2) would have little effect on the reinitiation process. mutations created were of either 2 or 3 nt to control for context effects on the BM2 AUG. the double pseudowild-type mutation also demonstrated abolition of BM2fluc expression. the structure presented for mfold 2 would still be able to form when the ribosome has translated through the upstream ORF and is in the process of termination. however, no restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed in the pseudowild-type construct. termination-dependent reinitiation on the BM2 ORF of segment 7 of influenza B virus is dependent on a relatively short (45 nt), largely unstructured, TURBS containing a typical motif 1 element towards the 5\u2032 end [11]. the effects of point mutations within motif 1 are consistent with such an interaction, but direct evidence is lacking in the BM2 system. the inhibition of termination-reinitiation by the AON that targeted motif 1 is highly consistent with its proposed role in binding to helix 26. however, the weight of evidence from mutational analysis suggests that the inhibitory effect of AONs directed against motif 1 are likely due to their blocking of the interaction between mRNA and 18S rRNA. eIF3 plays an important role in disassembly of ribosomes following the termination event which leaves the 80S ribosome with bound deacylated tRNA and still associated with the mRNA. eIF3 plays an important role in disassembly of ribosomes following the termination event which leaves the 80S ribosome with bound deacylated tRNA. eIF3 binds to the solvent face of the 40S subunit, promoting dissociation of the 60S subunit and leaving the 40S subunit still associated with the mRNA. eIF1 ejects the deacylated tRNA, while the eIF3j subunit promotes dissociation of the 40S subunit from the mRNA. eIF3 binds predominantly to the back or solvent face of the 40S ribosomal subunit. a bridging interaction in which eIF3 binds simultaneously to the 40S subunit and to the TURBS could help stabilise the binding of the 40S subunit to the TURBS for sufficient time as required to acquire an eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNA ternary complex. disruption of either of the putative stems in one arm inhibited reinitiation. however, little effect was observed when stem formation was disrupted in arm 2 of either stem-loop structure. RNA structure mapping of the TURBS of BM2 [11], FCV (Brierley et al. unpublished observations) and MNV [20] revealed that they are largely single-stranded, and probably metastable. the distance between the terminating ribosome and the TURBS is more critical to reinitiation efficiency. ribosomes can reinitiate at a downstream AUG codon or near-cognate reinitiation codon. if given a choice of a wild-type AUG and one located downstream, the ribosome always selects the wild-type AUG. motif 1 and TURBS deletion mutants were translated in the absence of 250nM 4EBP1. the fold-stimulation over the reinitiation levels observed in the absence of 4EBP1 is shown below the autoradiographs."}
