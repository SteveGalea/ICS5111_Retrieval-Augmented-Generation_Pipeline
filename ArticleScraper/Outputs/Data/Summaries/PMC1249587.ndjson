{"summary": "the SARS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus that has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. the genome is approximately 30 kb long and contains four structural proteins. the sequence analysis of SARS-CoV with other members of the coronavirus family did not show more than 20% nucleotide homology. Activation of specific CD8+ cells results in secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IFN- and TNF-) [21] and the synthesis of effector molecules, such as perforin and granzymes. the combination of DNA-NC, protein and XIAP elicited a significant anti-SARS CD8+ T-cell response independent of CD4+ T-cell immune responses. pEF6-Myc/His (Invitrogen) and pQE (Qiagen) vectors were cloned into the PCR 2.1 TOPO-TA vector. the 1.2 kb band corresponding to the NC gene was sub-cloned into BamHI-and EcoRI sites of pVAX-1. the fragment was also sub-cloned into the pEF6-Myc/His (Invitrogen) the recombinant protein was eluted with 150 mM imidazole. samples were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. the proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoretic transfer. the membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS-T and incubated with anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate. montanide ISA-51 mineral oil adjuvant was purchased from Seppic Inc. (Paris, France) pcDNA3 construct expressing 1.5 kb XIAP gene was a kind gift from Dr. R.G. Korneluk [24]. each mouse was boosted three times, at one month intervals. Splenocytes from immunized mice were resuspended at 2 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 50 M -mercaptoethanol and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. a 100 l aliquot containing 2 105 cells was added to each well of a 96 well plate. cells were stained intracellularly with anti-mouse IFN- FITC-labeled Ab. cells were incubated for 30 min (in the dark) at 4\u00b0C. increased 0.1% of IFN-gamma producing cells over the unstimulated control was considered positive response to vaccination. eptavidin-ALP-PQ (Mabtech) was added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. the plates were developed with 100 l per well BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase (Moss Inc) for 20 minutes. the reaction was stopped with rinsing the plates with tap water. the 1.2 kb band corresponding to the NC gene was sub-cloned into pVAX-1. the fragment was also sub-cloned into the pEF6-Myc/His (Invitrogen) and pQE (Qiagen) vectors. the pEF6 vector was designed to over produce recombinant proteins in mammalian cell lines. samples were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. the proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoretic transfer. the membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS-T. the blots were incubated with anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate. animal immunoization Six to eight week-old female B6/C3/F1 mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail. each mouse was boosted three times, at one month intervals. immunized mice were resuspended at 2 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640. a 100 l aliquot containing 2 105 cells was added to each well. cells were also stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. cells were stained intracellularly with anti-mouse IFN- FITC-labeled Ab. cells were incubated for 30 min (in the dark) at 4\u00b0C. an increase of 0.1% of IFN-gamma producing cells was considered positive response to vaccination. the reaction was stopped with rinsing the plates with tap water. the numbers of spots were analyzed with an ELISPOT reader. results were expressed as mean S.D. Western blot analysis of recombinant SARS-CoV-NC protein. Lane 1: purified protein from 109 cells transfected with pQE vector encoding nucleocapsid gene. Lane 2: represents cells transfected with the vector alone. antibody titers were determined in mice (n = 4) two weeks after the last immunization. the 96-well plates were coated with SARS-NC protein and mouse sera were serially diluted in wells for the endpoint titration of anti-NC antibody. was used to analyse the NC-specific CD4+T cell response. a negative control (without stimulation) and a positive control (phorbol myristate acetate + ionomycin) were included to control for the spontaneous production of IFN-. cells were also stimulated with an irrelevant protein, HIV-1 gp. the symbol indicates a significant difference (P = 0.01\u2013000.1) compared to the control group. the group DNA+XIAP, DNA-NC and NC protein + montanide/CpG did not show a high number of spot forming cells. the symbol indicates a significant difference (P 0.05) between the indicated group and the control group (DNA+XIAP) to increase the potency of the specific immune response, the full-length NC was amplified by RT-PCR and ligated into plasmid pVAX-1. for the expression and purification of the recombinant NC protein, CHO cells and E.coli were transfected with pEF6 and pQE vectors encoding the NC gene CHO cells transfected with pEF6-NC or vector alone were examined by transmission electron microscopy. neither the mock-transfected cells nor the cells transfected with the vector alone showed viral-like particles. the 96-well plates were coated with SARS-NC protein and mouse sera were serially diluted in wells for the endpoint titration of anti-NC antibody. results are shown as mean concentration S.D. the symbol indicates a significant difference (P = 0.01\u2013000.1) compared to animals immunized with DNA+XIAP and DNA-NC alone. 0.05) compared with the control group (DNA+XIAP) cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated by intracellular cytokine staining. the group receiving DNA-NC + NC protein and Montanide/CpG elicited higher levels of CD8+T-cells to nucleocapsid. however, the highest NC-specific CD8+T-cell response was detected in both splenocytes and fresh blood. the groups DNA+XIAP, DNA-NC and NC protein + montanide/CpG did not show a high number of spot forming cells (SFC) the groups did not show a high number of spot forming cells (SFC) studies indicate that the spike protein is responsible for the binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). mutation of this protein could affect the virulence by allowing the virus to escape from specific immune response[32,33]. montanide can induce strong antibody titers against HIV-1 structural genes. this adjuvant stimulates dendritic cells through toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing cell maturation and enhancing antigen presentation and Th1 responses. several studies have assessed the SARS-CoV-NC protein as a candidate vaccine. for example, Wang et al. showed a low proliferative response to NC in mice that receive a DNA vector expressing NC protein. a weak CD4+T cell response was also observed in our study. we are grateful to Drs. Katrina Gee and Neera Malik for reading the manuscript."}
