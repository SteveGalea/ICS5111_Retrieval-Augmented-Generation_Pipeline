{"summary": "a total of 478 avian influenza A (H7N9) and 47 A (H5N1) cases have been reported in mainland china. human cases with H7N9 infection were shown to be more spatially clustered than those with H5N1 infection. the epidemics of the two pathogens both showed strong seasonality. the map was created in ArcGIS 9.3 software (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). a higher risk of human infection was associated with increases in the number of live poultry markets. a higher risk of human infection was associated with increases in the number of live poultry markets. a higher relative humidity (after 70%) was associated with a higher risk of H5N1 infection. an elevated risk of H7N9 infection was associated with a higher density of poultry and lower shrub coverage. an elevated risk of H7N9 infection was associated with a higher density of poultry and shrub coverage. the distributions of high risk areas were similar between the two viruses. the majority of these areas were located in southeastern China. the majority of these areas were located in southeastern china. the distribution of HRA-III counties is similar to that of HRA-I and HRA-II, with a wider spatial range in these provinces. HAR-I represents counties with predicted probabilities of occurrence of human infection >50% for both H7N9 and H5N1. HAR-II (lazuli) represents counties with predicted probabilities of occurrence of human infection >50% for both H7N9 and H5N1 but not in HRA-I. HAR-III (rose) represents counties with predicted probability of occurrence of human H7N9 virus infection >50% but no in HRA-I and HRA-I. bHRA-II, counties with predicted probability of occurrence of human infection >50% but not in HRA-I and HRA-II. dHRA-III, counties with predicted probability of occurrence of human H5N1 virus infection >50% but no in HRA-I and HRA-II. live poultry markets had a higher contribution to the occurrence of human H5N1 infection than to the occurrence of human H7N9 infection in our model. this difference could result from the wider range of circulation of H7N9 compared to the occurrence of human H7N9 infection. lative humidity and precipitation played significant roles in human infections for both viruses. but temperature only affected the occurrence of human H7N9 infections. this is consistent with previous studies for the two viruses in early years15,22. data on human cases with avian influenza A (H7N9) and (H5N1) in china from 2003 to 2014 was collected from the world health organization23. each confirmed case was geo-referenced and linked to a digital map of China according to each patient\u2019s residence at the time of symptom onset using GIS technologies. the density of human population has been found to influence the risk of human cases of avian influenza15,16,21,22,25,26,27,28. land-cover variables represent the exposure level of human hosts to the potential sources of infection. water bodies constitute the natural habitat for waterfowl. boosted regression tree (BRT) models were constructed at the county level based on a \u201ccase-control\u201d design. boosted regression tree (BRT) models are efficient for predicting distributions of organisms while accounting for non-linear covariate-response relationships and interactions between covariates. risk maps for the presence of human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) or A (H5N1) virus were created based on the predicted probabilities over the 50 resamples. sensitivity BRT analyses were conducted using the data restricted to the main epidemic seasons for the two viruses. a total of 191 A4 areas were included in the analyses to represent the important sites for migration waterfowl. we classified all counties >50% model-predicted risks of human H5N1 or H7N9 infection into four types of high-risk areas (HRAs) the definitions of H5N1 and H7N9 human infections have been described as previously15,24. as in previous studies14,15,22, each confirmed case was geo-referenced and linked to a digital map of China according to each patient\u2019s residence at the time of symptom onset. the density of human population at the county level was obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. the geographic locations of live poultry markets in mainland China were obtained from AutoNavi (www.autonavi.com), which is a platform for web mapping and location-based services provider in China. d cases were regarded as \u201ccases\u201d, and five-fold \u201ccontrols\u201d were randomly selected from all counties without reported cases. building a BRT model is a stage-wise process. at each stage, the optimal tree is found to explain the residuals of the model from the previous stage and is linearly combined with the existing trees. Counties with high densities of poultry and swine are potential breeding ground for the virus to circulate. wild birds are known to be able to carry avian influenza viruses over long distances and to introduce them into new areas during migration33. infection >50% for both H7N9 and H5N1 but not in HRA-I; (3) HRA-III, counties with a predicted probability of occurrence of human H7N9 infection >50% but not in HRA-I and HRA-II. the distribution of the four types of HRAs was shown on a map."}
