{"summary": "translation process consists of three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. some viruses accomplish translation initiation via cap-dependent mechanisms. eIF4E protein can control eIF4F complex formation and interfere with cellular translation via phosphorylation on serine 209. sivestrol acts as a specific inhibitor of eIF4A [11]. cycloheximide (CHX) can block viral replication; its cytotoxic side effects and poor tolerability were prohibitive for its development as a drug. HHT targets the phosphorylated serine 209 residue of eIF4E. eIF4E represses replication of viruses belonging to six families. HHT-treated embryos, chickens, pigs, and mice were found to be less susceptible to viral infections. cells were seeded at 2.5 106 cells per well in standard six-well plates. antibodies to actin (1:1000), goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (1:10,000) were obtained from beyotime biotechnology (Haimen, China) rcetin and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinase 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) kinase inhibitors CGP57380 were obtained from MedChemExpress. cells seeded at 2.5 105 cells per well were infected with ten-fold serially diluted HSV-1 for 1.5 h. infected cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM containing 1% FBS infected cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 (for VSV) or 0.1 (for PEDV) after the 1.5-h virus adsorption period, infected cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM. infected cells were harvested at 48 h post infection for quantification of viral yield. specific pathogen-free chicken Embryo Assay For each inoculation, a mixture of HHT (Aladdin, 98% purity) and NDV (50 plaque-forming units (PFU) or AIV (500 PFU) was injected into the allantoic cavity of specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. each dilution of 25 L was serially diluted in sterile saline. chickens were challenged by intramuscular injection with 104 PFU of GFP-NDV. mRNA in the liver and lung was quantified by qRT-PCR. euthanasia was carried out in a soundproof room to avoid panic of the living animals. animals were housed with pathogen-free food and water under 12-h light-cycle conditions. animals were sacrificed at the indicated days post infection. lungs were then harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. pathological changes were observed under an Olympus microscope. Optical density (OD) values were measured at a test wave length of 570 nm using a Multiskan Ascent Microplate Photometer. statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) strains H9-WD [30], herpes simplex virus type 1 strain F [31], and pseudorabies virus (PRV) strain Fa [32] were obtained according to the corresponding references indicated above. antibodies to NDV-NP (1:2000) and PRV-gC (1:1000) were preserved in DMEM containing 2% FBS for indicated times. antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% skim milk. acyclovir, quercetin, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinase 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) kinase inhibitors CGP57380 were obtained from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) infected cells were infected with virus for 1.5 h (adsorption) and infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 (for VSV) or 0.1 (for PEDV) infected cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 48 h. a mixture of HHT (Aladdin, 98% purity) and NDV (50 plaque-forming units (PFU) or AIV (500 PFU) was injected into the allantoic cavity of specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. eggs were incubated for different times, and allantoic fluid was harvested to measure viral yield. each dilution of 25 L was mixed with an equal volume of 1% washed red blood cells (RBC) of chicken. maximum dilution of allantoic fluid that still resulted in complete agglutination of RBC suspension was recorded as HA unit (HAU) of virus titer. euthanasia was carried out in a soundproof room to avoid panic. animal protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of China Agricultural University were followed. animals were housed with pathogen-free food and water under 12-h light-cycle conditions. cells in 96-well plates were treated with increasing doses of HHT at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. then, 10 L of MTT solution was added to each well and the samples were incubated for 4 h. the medium was removed and 100 L of Formazan solution was added to each well. HEK293T cells were infected with VSV in the presence of HHT or ribavirin at increasing concentrations. viral yields were reduced by 1.5 orders of magnitude when treated with HHT at 50 nM. no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected. HEK293T cells were mock infected or infected with VSV at 0.5 MOI. at 24 and 36 h post infection (h.p.i.), cell lysates were harvested. electrophoretically separated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. yields were observed when HHT was added at the time of infection and from 2 h.p.i. onward. strong viral reductions were observed with co-treatment and post-treatment for up to 8 h for VSV infection. these results indicate that HHT acts in the viral replication cycle after viral entry. in 24-well plates were exposed to GFP-NDV at 0.1 MOI in the presence of HHT at increasing concentrations for 24 h. expression of GFP was directly observed using a DP73 camera. Graphs represent the average from three embryos per experimental group. error bars denote standard errors of the means. each experiment was performed in triplicate. HHT at a dose of 0.07 mg/kg had a slight effect on viral infection. 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced HAU values by one and three orders of magnitude. 0.2 mg/kg HHT significantly decreased the mRNA level of NDV-NP in the liver and lung. ovir HSV-1 3809 0.789 4828 Experiments were carried out in triplicate. a half maximal cytotoxic concentration (M) b half maximal inhibitory concentration (M). c Selectivity index = CC50/IC50. 3.3. HHT Reduces Viral Load in PEDV-Infected Cells and Piglets. well plates were infected with PEDV at 0.1 MOI in the presence of the HHT at different concentrations for 48 h. these experiments were performed two times with three replicates in each experiment. values represent means and SD. piglets were challenged via intramuscular injection with 2 103 PFU of PEDV. mRNA in intestine was quantified by qRT-PCR at five days post infection. 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 1.1 and 1.3 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i. and 0.2 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 2.6 and 2.0 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i. representative lung sections from each group were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with antibody against AIV-NP and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. HHT at days 0, 2, and 4 after treatment (k,l,m) HHT treatment at 500 nM led to a strong reduction in PRV-gC level. there were obvious differences in the ability of HHT to reduce the viral replication of HSV-1 and PRV. at 72 h.p.i., viral yields were determined by plaque assay. HHT reduces the level of phosphorylated eIF4E (p-eIF4E), as well as the level of Mcl-1 [22,26]. p-eIF4E levels were gradually reduced (lanes 3\u20135), while cellular total eIF4E level was unaffected. positive control was treated with CGP57380 (inhibitor of MNK1/2 kinase, the eIF4E upstream kinase) [46] cells in a T-25 flask were transfected with FLAG-tagged eIF4E (lanes 3,5) or eIF4E-S209A plasmid (lanes 4,6) (5 g each), in the absence (lanes 1\u20134) of HHT at 100 nM, then mock infected (lane 1) or infected with HSV-1/F at 10 MOI for 10 h (lanes 2\u20136) rhabdovirus VSV is widely studied as model of viral protein translational control. ribavirin at 800 M inhibited VSV titer in cells by 2.5 orders of magnitude. no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at a concentration of 1 M. HEK293T cells seeded at 2.5 106 cells per well in standard six-well plates were infected with VSV at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the presence of HHT or ribavirin at different concentrations for 24 h. the experiments were performed two times with three replicates in each experiment. two times with three replicates in each experiment. values represent means and SD. compared to PBS-treated group (D) HHT at 50 nM greatly reduced the production of a recombinant NDV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), as determined by light microscopy. correspondingly, HHT treatment showed a dose-dependent reduction in infection rate. no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at concentrations below 1 M. effects of HHT on HeLa cell viability were determined. Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test. DV-NP messenger RNA (mRNA) in the liver and lung was quantified by qRT-PCR at seven days post infection. Graphs represent the average from 10 animals per experimental group. values represent means and SD. ribavirin inhibited GFP-NDV replication with an IC50 value of 44.241 M. IC50 and half maximum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) showed that the HHT treatment at the indicated dosages was more effective than ribavirin. no measurable decrease in cell viability was detected at a concentration of 1 M. IC50 values of HHT and quercetin in PEDV were 0.112 M and 6.897 M respectively. a strong reduction in PEDV-N protein and mRNA levels was also observed. Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test. p 0.01 compared to PBS-treated group (C). mRNA in three to four randomly drawn blood samples was also analyzed by qRT-PCR. each group represents independent experiments. each experiment was performed in triplicate. 0.1 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 1.1 and 1.3 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i. and 0.2 mg/kg HHT reduced the HAU value by 2.6 and 2.0 orders of magnitude at 48 and 72 h.p.i. HHT treatment at 500 and 1000 nM led to reductions of one and three orders of magnitude in vero cells. acyclovir, an inhibitor of viral DNA replication, is the only approved medicine for HSV-1 infection therapies. at 48 h.p.i., cell lysates were harvested and electrophoretically separated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to viral protein PRV-gC and actin (B). at 36 h.p.i., cell lysates were harvested and electrophoretically separated proteins were analyzed. ase can prevent the phosphorylation of eIF4E without an effect on total eIF4E protein level (lane 7). eIF4E regulates the phosphorylation levels of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) p-eIF4E was increased upon PEDV, HSV-1, and PRV. high levels of p-eIF4E, in parallel with the level of viral protein, were gradually reduced under treatment with increasing doses of HHT (lanes 3\u20137). HHT at a high dose (1.0 mg/kg) was found in previous work to eradicate acute myeloid leukemia in vivo in mice. all the mice obtained long-term disease-free survival. in vivo effects and cytotoxicity of HHT in piglets and chickens were not previously reported. ed the infection of RNA viruses VSV, NDV, and PEDV at 50, 100, and 500 nM in cell cultures. a time-of-addition study revealed that HHT remains potent even when administrated 8 h post infection. fibroblasts and mice in which the serine at position 209 of eIF4E is replaced with alanine are less susceptible to virus infections, including HSV-1, VSV, and EMCV. phosphorylation status of eIF4E acts as a determinant of host susceptibility to a virus. combination therapy might improve antiviral efficacy, reduce viral resistance, and minimize toxicity and side effects in the control of viral infections and epidemic viral diseases."}
