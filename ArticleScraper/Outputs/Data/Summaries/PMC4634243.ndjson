{"summary": "1, 2, 3 Globally, AIVs occasionally cause infection in humans and their livestock, such as poultry, pigs, and other wild animals with harmful outcomes. some of the highly pathogenic AIV strains, in particular H5N1, have occasionally infected humans with high mortality rates exceeding 60%. bulbs of L. radiata have long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of laryngeal complications, furuncles, carbuncles, and suppurative wounds. a voucher specimen (No. 2006101201) was deposited in the herbarium of china Pharmaceutical University. the alkaloid fraction was subjected to repeated column chromatography over silica gel, Sephadex LH20, and prepHPLC to yield lycorine (AA1), hippeastrine (AA2), hemanthamine (AA3), 11hydroxy vittatine (AA4), lycorenine, dihydrolycorine, lycoramine, 9Odemethylhomolycorine, galanthamine, galanthine, Omethyllycoren cytotoxicity and cellbased antiviral activity of amaryllidaceae alkaloids and oseltamivir were evaluated using the WST1 assay. cell plates were incubated with serial twofold dilutions of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (containing 05% DMSO) in DMEM (100 l) after incubation for 72 h, 10 l of the solution was added to each well of the plate. the selectivity index (SI) for each Amaryllidaceae alkaloid was calculated by dividing the CC50 by the EC50 (CC50/EC50) the selectivity index (SI) for each Amaryllidaceae alkaloid was calculated by dividing the CC50 by the EC50 (CC50/EC50) the supernatant was replaced with four compounds (AA1: 052 m; AA2: 8207 m; AA3: 415 m; AA4: 1345 m, 100 l) for 72 h. virus mixed with the compounds were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. for postinfection treatment, virus was absorbed for 1 h, and then the supernatant was replaced with or without drug for 72 h. the luciferase gene fluc was cloned in the antisense orientation. the fulllength cDNAs of PB2, PB1, PA, and NP were then cloned into pDL. the viral RNP complex plays an important role in viral generation, replication, and pathogenicity. cells were collected for detecting luciferase activities (Promega) at 24 h after transfection. the four amaryllidaceae alkaloid compounds were assayed for virus inhibition in triplicate. after 72 h of incubation, the HA titer was determined as above. ten microliters of a solution of purified N1type NA was added to 70 l of detection buffer. then 10 l of a test compound was added at 37\u00b0C for 2 min. determination of inhibitory activity of test compounds on H5N1 pseudovirus entry Pseudotyped virus was produced by triple transfection. luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase kit (Promega) and a microplate luminometer (Genios Pro) cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated for an additional 48 h. d goat antimouse IgG washed again and incubated with DAPI for 10 min in the dark to stain nuclei. specific staining and structure of the cells were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. cytotoxicity and cellbased antiviral activity of amaryllidaceae alkaloids and oseltamivir were evaluated using the WST1 assay. cells were incubated with serial twofold dilutions of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (containing 05% DMSO) in DMEM (100 l) after incubation for 72 h, 10 l of WST1 solution was added to each well of the plate. the optical density (OD)/absorbance was measured 4 h later. each experiment was performed in triplicate. the percentage of viable cells was compared with untreated controls. dase inhibitor >10 EC50 0015 056 0625 011 >6667 CC50: mean (50%) value of effective concentration. EC90: mean (90%) value of effective concentration. luciferase genes were amplified from plasmid pGL3 control vector. luciferase gene fluc was cloned in antisense orientation and flanked by noncoding regions from segment 5 of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. viral RNP complex plays an important role in viral generation, replication, and pathogenicity. four expression plasmids for PB2, PB1, PA, and NP (50 ng each) were cotransfected into 293T cells (12well plates) together with polIfluc (10 ng, expressing firefly luciferase, Promega) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. at 8 h after transfection, cells were replaced with 500 l media containing the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid compounds at indicated concentrations. HI assay was carried out as described by Ehrhardt et al. the plasmid contains a luciferase reporter gene and defective viral Env and Vpr genes. at 48 h after transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, 25 the supernatant was harvested and stored at 70\u00b0C. the positive control drug LY294002 (Sigma, San Francisco, CA, USA) at 30 m was removed at 12, 24, 48 h p.i. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 025% Triton for 15 min, and incubated with an antiAIV NP monoclonal antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. inhibitory effects of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids after virus entry into cells. we added the compounds prior to (pretreatment) or simultaneously with virus infection of the cells. the results showed that the antiviral effects of the compounds against influenza were not due to the prevention of virus attachment or alteration of the cell receptor. the viral HA titer was similar to that of the positive control (protocol 2). These results showed that the primary effect of the four compounds were by inhibition of the virus after entry into cells. the antiviral activity of AA2 was lower than other compounds detected after 48 h p.i. AA3, AA4 and different times of addition were tested. the different protocols (1\u20137) are illustrated in Figure 2 and described in Methods. AA1\u2013AA4 do not affect viral RNP activity in vitro. AA1 and AA3 were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to ensure synchronous replication. no HA titer was detected by treatment of the cells with AA1 and AA3. AA1 and AA3 do not inhibit hemagglutination of influenza virus. none of the four compounds inhibited viral attachment onto cRBCs. AA1 and AA3 do no exhibit inhibitory activities on N1type neuraminidase. results suggest that the NA protein was not targeted for inhibition of influenza A virus by AA1 or AA3. indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed using an antiNP antibody. in infected but no AAtreated cells (AA), the nucleocapsid protein (NP, green) showed a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm after 8 h p.i in singleround replication and multiround replication (Figure 6A,B), which was compared with positive drug group (LY294002) DAPI + NP (f, I, l, o, r, u, x, z) were detected by immunofluorescence. the location of NP protein at mutiround replication (24 and 48 h p i) was tested in Figure 6C. NP protein still in nucleus by 48 h p.i indicated this compound could block the protein export from nucleus. the replication of influenza virus was inhibited by four active compounds AA1\u2013AA4 after virus entry. the other eleven compounds were not possessed antiviral activity in pretreatment, simultaneous treatment, and posttreatment. the HA titer was tested to determine the effect on release of total virus particles from infected cells by treating infected cells with the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid compounds over multiple replication cycles. the results showed that AA1, AA2, AA3, AA4 exerted its effect at a step after virus entry into cells, and the activity of AA2 was lower than other compounds. incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, inoculated onto cells 1 h and then the media were replaced with drugfree DMEM for 72 h. 6, mixture of virus at 001 MOI and Amaryllidaceae alkaloids compounds were added to cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then replaced with drugfree DMEM for 72 h. 293T cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid polILuc and internal control plasmid Renilla. at 8 h p.i. the supernatants were removed and replaced with Optimem containing various concentrations of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids compounds (AA1:467 m; AA2:1520 m; AA3:490 m; AA4:1670 m, 500 AA1 (052 m) against virus was observed after a single round of replication (12 h p.i.) about 50% of the virus was inhibited when added at 24\u201372 h. AA1 and AA3 do not inhibit hemagglutination activity. type NA was used to test the effect of the two compounds AA1 (467 m) and AA3 (490 m) these compounds demonstrated stronger antiviral activities among the four compounds tested, using a neuraminidase inhibitor screening kit. the result suggested that the NA protein was not targeted for inhibition of influenza A virus by AA1 or AA3. 178 H5N1 HPAIV (MOI = 1) and MDCK cells were either untreated or were treated with AA1 or AA3 as follows. the location of NP protein was tested in single replication (8 h p i), cells treated with AA1 (467 m), AA3 (490 m) after 1 h of virus adsorption at 4\u00b0C. ly294002 showed the strong inhibition by compounds in single replication of virus. AAtreated cells after virus adsorption (1 or 2 h p.i.) abundant RNP complexes assembled in the nucleus. AA1 and AA3 exhibiting stronger antiviral activities were chosen for further study in MDCK cellbased assays. postinfection treatment with the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects. the antiinfluenza activities of these compounds from L. radiata have never been reported. they could inhibit influenza virus replication, which was more effective when added earlier during infection. however, none of these compounds affected the activity of the RNP complex.
