{"summary": "real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most accurate measure of gene expression in biological systems. no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes when co-regulation is not present. real-time RT-qPCR provides the most accurate and specific measure of gene expression, with an unsurpassed dynamic range and a high level of reproducibility. the identification of new reference genes from microarray data has been demonstrated to provide more \"stable\" reference genes than those conventionally used [11,14-16] as determined using stability algorithms. microarray data has yet to identify a new reference gene which shows consistent stability across multiple tissue or cell types, and/or disease situations. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase Gene Symbol Accession Number [GenBank] Forward(F) and Reverse(R) Primers Probe Sequence Average Standard Deviation of Triplicate R2 PCR Efficiency CG14980-PB Protein coding C7orf28B XM_536878 F-gcaggaagggattctccag R-ggtccagtaagaaatcttccataa gccagg agga 25.2 0.993 97.2 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase Purine biosynthesis ATIC XM_858011 F-cgctgcctctcactgag cagcaggt 13.4 0.991 97.7 Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 Phosphorylates microtubule- serine synthase I Membrane bound protein that catalyses the replacement of phospholipids by L-serine PTDSS1 XM_849686 F-actcagaatgcgacgatgg R-tcagaaccttttttcg ctggtctc 15.3 0.996 100.9 Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 Mitochondrial protein synthesis MRPS7 XM_84 geNorm and bestkeeper agreed on the most stably expressed genes.

GAPDH was identified as the 9th most stably expressed gene by NormFinder, the 7th most stably expressed gene by geNorm, and the 5th most stably expressed gene by Bestkeeper. all methods agreed on the five most stably expressed genes. MRPS25 was the least stably expressed gene as determined by both NormFinder and geNorm. comparison of reference gene performance in all tissues. MRPS7 was stably expressed in all five tissues. HIRP5 was found to be stably expressed in four tissues. comparison of gene stability (M) and pairwise stability (V) values with previous study of commonly used reference genes. bestkeeper and NormFinder always identified the same gene as being most stably expressed. fat pad showed the highest correlation between methods, followed by cruciate ligament, cartilage, bone and synovium as the least consistent. MRPS7 demonstrates the most consistent metric (low geNorm M value, low NormFinder value and high Bestkeeper correlation) genes were finally filtered on the basis of defined annotation and level of expression. in retrospect, genes should have been selected on the basis of single transcript expression. absence of splice variants did not necessarily confer reference gene stability across multiple tissues. mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. mitochondrial ribosomal protein S25 was also stably expressed. mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 was one of six genes identified from microarray data. the normalisation of microarray data by geometric mean of three reference genes [6] did not identify genes with appropriate stability to be suitable for use as reference genes. the instability of these genes may be reflected by the greater variation identified in the triplicate repeats of each assay. the less stable expression of the three conventional reference genes (GAPDH, RPL13A and SDHA) probably resulted in the selection of similarly \"unstably\" expressed reference genes from microarray data. the rank order of reference gene stability was identified most consistently for fat pad, followed by cruciate ligament, cartilage, bone and least consistently for synovium. the advantage of using a model based stability assessment is that rank ordering can be changed if co-regulated genes are included. cranial cruciate ligament samples were generated from a custom designed 44 k transcript canine whole genome 60 mer oligonucleotide microarray. raw data was normalised by two methods; locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) or using the geometric mean of 3 conventional reference genes arbitrarily selected. each experimental group being 30% (in all experiments) the data sets were reduced to 420 transcripts (LOWESS normalised) and 13 transcripts (reference gene normalisation) the data set was reduced to 12 genes, of which 10 were selected. rapatellar fat (n = 5), ruptured cranial cruciate ligament (n = 5), femoral head articular cartilage (n = 5), ulnar subchondral bone (n = 5) and synovial membrane (n = 5) were obtained from dogs with clinical OA secondary to naturally occurring joint disease. the samples were obtained as part of the standard surgical treatment for the disease in question. synthesis Reverse transcription was performed using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Dorset, UK) according to manufacturer instructions. Initially 200 g (10 l) total RNA was pre-incubated with 0.5 g (1 l) oligo-dT12\u201318 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 10 mM (1 l) dNTP mix (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) at 65\u00b0 for 5 minutes. real-time RT-qPCR assays were performed in triplicate using the LightCycler\u00ae 480 (Roche Diagnostics; Lewes, UK) in 384 well format, with three no template controls used for each assay. the reaction volume in each well consisted of 5 L LightCycler\u00ae 480 Probes Master 2 concentration (Roche Diagnostics) reference gene stability analysis Real-time RT-qPCR data was exported into an Excel datasheet. geNorm generates a stability measure (the M value) for each gene which is arbitrarily suggested to be lower than 0.4 (with a lower value indicating increased gene stability across samples) bestkeeper generates a pairwise correlation co-efficient between each gene and the Bestkeeper index. the stability values for each gene, as determined by each method of analysis, are illustrated in Figure 2A, B, and 2C. Statistical tests were performed using a statistical software package (Minitab V14.1; Minitab Ltd.; Coventry, UK) the ranking order of genes was then calculated using the ranking order of genes to compare the relationship of the relative ordering of genes. data for each reference gene candidate was compared to ruptured CCL Selection of reference gene candidates. the stepwise procedure for identifying reference gene candidates is illustrated in Figure 1. protein S25 [MRPS25], ORM1-like 2 [ORMDL2], Phosphatidylserine synthase 1 [PTDSS1], Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7] and Transketolase [TKT] were selected from the reference gene normalised data (Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells 176 [TRAPPC2L] and Cytoplasmic protein NCK2 [NC RNA extraction For all of the tissue samples total RNA was extracted using a phenol/guanidine hydrochloride reagent (Trizol, Invitrogen Ltd, UK) an on column DNA digestion step was included (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) total RNA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assay design Transcript sequences were obtained from the national centre for biotechnology information [29] BLAST searches were performed for all primer sequences to confirm gene specificity. electrophoresis of the PCR reaction mixture confirmed a single product of the appropriate length in all cases. the standard amplification conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds. standard curves were generated for each reference gene by employing cDNA or template oligonucleotides [34], the parameters of which are listed in Table 1. all samples were checked for absence of genomic DNA contamination using a canine genome specific RT-qPCR assay. bestkeeper generates a pairwise correlation co-efficient between each gene and the Bestkeeper index. bestkeeper can only be used to analyse a maximum of 10 housekeeping genes so the three genes least stably expressed were excluded from Bestkeeper analysis.
