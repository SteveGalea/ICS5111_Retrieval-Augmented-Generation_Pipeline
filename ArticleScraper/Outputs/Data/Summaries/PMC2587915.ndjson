{"summary": "in 2003, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged from zoonotic pools of virus in china to cause a global outbreak of Severe and Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) causing over 8000 human cases and greater than 700 deaths. the clinical course of SARS-CoV disease in humans is characterized by fever, non-productive cough, and malaise culminating in lung infiltrates visible by X-ray and an atypical pneumonia. in 6 amino acids and infection of young or senescent BALB/c mice with either MA15 or recombinant MA15 (rMA15) results in high virus titers in the lung, pulmonary pathology, and 100% mortality resembling the pathogenesis of the most severe human cases of SARS-CoV. a model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis with both disease and convalescence would allow for the elucidation of pathways involved in the innate matitis virus (VSV), or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in more severe disease [16]\u2013[19]. role of MyD88 signaling in rMA15 pathogenesis has not yet been investigated. mouse model of rMA15 acute pathogenesis characterized by high titer virus replication within the lung. myD88/ mice are highly susceptible to rMA15 infection. age matched C57BL/6 (n = 14), congenic RAG-1/ (n = 21) and congenic MyD88/ (n = 16) mice were infected intranasally with 105 pfu of recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) and monitored for virus-induced morbidity and mortality. 100% of IL-1R1- or IL-18R1-deficient mice survived infection by rMA15. ii) adaptive immunity does not play a major role in protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice. strain were harvested on 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9 dpi. titers within clarified supernatants were assessed by plaque assay. mean titers are displayed and error bars represent 1 standard deviation. the greater mortality observed in rMA15-infected MyD88/ mice was not due to enhanced replication at extrapulmonary sites. in situ hybridization was performed on tissue sections using an 35S-UTP-labeled riboprobe complementary for the N gene of SARS-CoV. in situ signal was not observed in lung sections derived from mice that received intranasal administration of PBS alone. images (magnification, 100) are representative of at least three mice. decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in myD88/ mice Infection of WT mice with rMA15 results in a rapid inflammatory response in the lungs. this virus-induced inflammatory response likely has both protective and pathologic consequences. IFN was slightly higher, although not statistically significant, in infected MyD88/ mice at all time points analyzed. rMA15 induction of proinflammatory genes is reduced in both strains of mice. induction of CCL3 (22 fold difference at 2 dpi, P0.005; 5 fold difference at 4 dpi, p0.005) and CCL5 (8 fold difference at 2 dpi, P0.005; 8 fold difference at 4 dpi, P0.01) dramatically reduced in infected MyD88-/- compared to infected WT mice. myD88/ mice showed a denuding bronchiolitis characterized by an extrusion of airway epithelial cells into the lumen of the airway and epithelial/endothelial atypia. at 4 dpi, myD88/ mice continued to exhibit a denuding bronchiolitis, epithelial/endothelial atypia, and peri-venular immune cell infiltration. WT mice at 2 dpi showed an exacerbation of the inflammatory infiltrate seen on 2 dpi, PBV edema was not observed. by 6 dpi, normal bronchiolar epithelial architecture is restored but inflammatory infiltrates are still present. pronounced immune cell infiltration around the airway though perivascular cuffing was observed. by 6 dpi, the severity of PBV edema and denuding bronchiolitis had waned. the host immune response to the virus was similar in quality and quantity, but delayed in onset by 5\u20136 days in the MyD88/ mice. anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-Gr-1, and anti-F4/80 antibodies were used to define the following cell types by cell surface antigen staining. alveolar macrophages (CD11c+/F4/80+/CD11blow/), dendritic cells (CD11c+/CD11b or CD11b+/F4/80/Gr-1), inflammatory monocytes/macrophages (CD11b+ staining pattern, including the Gr-1high/F4/80 population (R3) and the Gr-1int/F4/80+/CD11b+ inflammatory monocyte/macrophage population (R4 and R5) were dramatically reduced in lung tissue of rMA15-infected MyD88/ mice compared to infected control mice. at 2 dpi, similar numbers of inflammatory monocytes were detected in infected MyD88/ and mock-inf 10 wk old B6 WT or MyD88/ mice were inoculated intranasally with PBS or 105 pfu rMA15. at 2 dpi, lung leukocytes were isolated as described in Materials and Methods. in response to rMA15 infection, myD88/ mice failed to upregulate expression of a number of proinflammatory chemokines that promote monocyte recruitment. we hypothesized that mice deficient in monocytes or specific chemokine receptors important for recruitment of inflammatory monocytes may be more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease. both IP and IN administration of clodronate liposomes failed to alter morbidity and mortality. hematoxylin and eosin stained lung sections from 2dpi. signs of inflammation and virus induced lung pathology are evident in wild-type mice on 2dpi with PBV cuffing caused by infiltrating immune cells, apoptosis of the airway epithelium, and mild denuding bronchiolitis. on days 3\u201313 dpi, differences in weights of CCR5 deficient and WT mice were statistically different by Mann-Whitney test with a P value cutoff of 0.05. hematoxylin and eosin stained lung sections from 2 dpi. -induced disease, age matched C57BL/6 (n = 14), congenic RAG-1/ (n = 21), and congenic MyD88/ (n = 16) mice were infected intranasally with 105 pfu of recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) and monitored for virus-induced morbidity and mortality. infected WT and RAG-1/ mice lost 144% and 94% of starting body weight by 3 adaptive immunity does not play a major role in protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice. ii) adaptive immunity does not play a major role in protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice. viral loads in lung tissue of rMA15-infected MyD88/ mice were significantly higher than WT mice at 2, 3, 4 and 6 dpi and RAG-1/ mice at both 2 and 4 dpi. despite the absence of significant signs of disease at late time points, viral lung titers remained elevated in lung tissue of rMA15-infected RAG-1/ mice at 7 and 9 dpi. intense rMA15-specific in situ signal was observed in rMA15-infected WT and MyD88/ mice. by 3 to 4 dpi, the distribution and intensity of rMA15-specific in situ signal had greatly diminished in lung tissue of WT mice. by 6 dpi, though diminished, rMA15-specific in situ signal was still readily detectable in lung tissue of MyD88/ mice. quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess mRNA levels of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine gene expression in the infected mouse lung at various times post-infection. however, similar to previous reports, we were unable to detect significant induction of type I IFN in either lung tissue of either WT or MyD88/ mice following SARS-CoV infection by qRT-PCR. WT (black bars) and MyD88/ mice (white bars) were inoculated intranasally with rMA15. at 2, 4, and 6 dpi, mice were euthanized and total lung RNA was analysed. levels of gene transcription for Type I and Type III interferons (A), proinflammatory chemokines (B) and proinflammatory cytokines (C) were assessed. rMA15-infected MyD88/ mice are required for early induction of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines within pulmonary tissues of SARS-CoV-infected mice. inflammatory chemokine and cytokine transcription suggested that the innate immune response was severely delayed in myD88-deficient mice. WT mice at 2 dpi exhibited pronounced lung inflammation characterized by perivascular cuffing, endothelial and epithelial atypia, and peribronchivascular immune cell infiltration. at 4 dpi, MyD88/ mice continued to exhibit a denuding bronchiolitis, epithelial/endothelial atypia, and the added phenotype of PBV edema without immune perivascular cuffing (filled arrowhead), endothelial and epithelial atypia (vacuolization and disruption of normal epithelium and endothelium) on 4 dpi, myD88-/- mice showed an exacerbation of the inflammatory infiltrate (filled arrowhead) seen on 2 dpi, PBV edema was not observed. the host immune response to the virus was similar in quality and quantity. but delayed in onset by 5\u20136 days in the MyD88/ mice. the expression analyses of proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines and the lung pathology suggested that MyD88 is critical for early immune/inflammatory responses in lung tissue following SARS-CoV infection. cell surface staining of lung leukocytes with anti-Gr-1, anti-F4/80, and anti-CD11b antibodies revealed two distinct cell populations, defined by region 3 (R3) and R4/R5 in the histograms. the most dramatic differences detected in percentages and total numbers were cells with a Gr-1int/F4/80+/CD11b+ cell surface phenotype defined in R4 and R5 (Fig. 5A, B, and C infected MyD88/ mice compared to infected control mice. at 2 dpi, similar numbers of inflammatory monocytes were detected in infected MyD88/ and mock-infected mice. at 4 dpi, a similar percentage and total number of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages were isolated from the lung tissue of WT and MyD88/ mice. inflammatory monocytes/macrophages isolated from mock (), rMA15-infected WT () or rMA15-infected MyD88/ () mice at 2 dpi. inflammatory monocytes/macrophages isolated from mock (), rMA15-infected WT () or rMA15-infected MyD88/ () mice at 4 dpi. IP and IN administration of clodronate liposomes failed to alter morbidity and mortality. however, the intranasal administration of clodronate liposomes 2 days post rMA15 infection of C57BL/6 mice failed to induce more severe disease or mortality. inconclusive results from our clodronate depletion studies and to continue exploring the importance of monocyte recruitment in SARS-CoV disease. mice deficient in either CCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 showed more prominent airway epithelial cell apoptosis, a severe denuding bronchiolitis, and perivenular/periarterial cuffing. the lung pathological conditions described above were the most severe in CCR1 deficient mice. peribronchivascular cuffing (filled arrowhead) caused by infiltrating immune cells, apoptosis of the airway epithelium, and a mild denuding bronchiolitis. mice deficient in either CCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 exhibited more prominent airway epithelial cell apoptosis, a severe denuding bronchiolitis with an accumulation of cohesive apoptotic debris. kine/chemokines, the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung, viral clearance and subsequent convalescence. the recovery from rMA15 disease is dependent on MyD88 but does not seem to be dependent on the presence of functional T or B cells. the discrepancy regarding clearance of virus in RAG-1/ mice may be due to the differing doses used and/or the enhanced pathogenesis of the mouse adapted virus. IFN/ receptor deficient mice with rMA15 are protected from lethal SARS-CoV infection by a MyD88-dependent mechanism that does. intranasal infection of myD88-deficient mice with RSV or VSV produces more severe disease that was correlated with a failure to recruit immune cells to the sites of infection. human cases of SARS-CoV, mouse models, and in vitro data suggest inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are important in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. protection from SARS-CoV infection correlates with myD88-dependent induction of IL1-, TNF-, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1, and RANTES at early times post infection. at early times post infection, the chemokine/cytokine response occurs with the recruitment in vitro data suggests that macrophages are not productively infected by SARS-CoV. however, these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines like IP-10 and MCP-1 in response to the virus. in the future, bone marrow chimeras between WT and MyD88/ mice may help deduce if myeloid derived cells are responsible for the induction of the protective inflammatory response. CCR1 (MCP-1), CCR2 (MIP-1 and RANTES) and CCR5 (MIP-1 and RANTES) bind chemokines upregulated in the lungs of rMA15 infected WT mice whose expression are coincident with the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the lung. a robust mouse model of acute SARS-CoV pathogenesis will allow for detailed analysis of virus-host interactions. our studies may guide epidemiological studies in human populations in order to deduce if myD88 related inflammatory genes or CCRs contributed to protection or prevention of severe SARS-CoV disease. the model can be employed to study the contributions of various innate immune genes in the protection from severe SARS-CoV disease. mice were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and intranasally infected with either DPBS alone or 105pfu/50 l rMA15 or the recombinant epidemic strain, icSARS, in DPBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) mice were monitored at 24 h intervals for virus-induced morbidity and mortality. tissue sections were washed, dehydrated through graded ethanol. sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and silver grain deposition was analyzed. qRT-PCR Lungs from mock- or rMA15-infected mice were removed. total RNA was isolated following manufacturer's instructions. banded cells were collected, washed in wash buffer (1 HBSS, 15 mM HEPES), and total viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. cells were fixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a Cyan cytometer using Summit software. mice were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and intranasally infected with either DPBS alone or 105pfu/50 l rMA15 or the recombinant epidemic strain, icSARS, in DPBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) all viral and animal experiments were performed in a certified biosafety level 3 laboratory. whole blood was harvested via cardiac puncture and collected in BD microtainer tubes for serum separation. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) to determine extent of inflammation. sections were stained with hematoxylin and scored in a blinded manner. complementary DNA was generated from 0.25\u20131 ug of total RNA using 250 ng random primers (Invitrogen) and superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) real-time PCR experiments were performed using Taqman gene expression assays and an AB Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems) cells were fixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a Cyan cytometer using Summit software.
