{"summary": "white matter accounts for 60% of total brain volume in humans. white matter is composed mostly of bundled axons and glial cells. large axons in the brain are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath. oligodendrocytes are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath. failure, white matter integrity after stroke shows little improvement over time [10] without proper remyelination, naked axons are degraded, thereby interrupting neuronal communication and leading to functional disabilities. therapeutic interventions to promote differentiation of oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination of axons are promising strategies to achieve successful white matter repair and functional recovery after stroke. IL-4 deficiency significantly impairs long-term sensorimotor and cognitive performance after ischemic stroke. IL-4 supplementation improves functional outcomes in two models of stroke. CD45CD11bGFAP+ astrocytes, CD45CD11bNeuN+ neurons, CD45intermediateCD11b+ microglia, CD45highCD11b+ macrophages, and other infiltrated immune cells (CD45+CD11b) 3 d after 60-min MCAO. IL-4R was also expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Fig 1A\u20131D) Flow cytometric analysis of IL-4R in brain cells of WT mice 3 d after MCAO. n = 3 mice. *p 0.05. Student\u2019s t test. MCAO mice were subjected to transient focal ischemia induced by 60-min MCAO. the overall immunofluorescence intensity of MBP staining decreased at 14 d after MCAO, indicating a significant loss of myelin protein after stroke. IL-4 is important in maintaining axonal myelination or promoting axonal remyelination after stroke. we explored the remyelination capacity of IL-4 in a model of lysophosphatidylcholine/lysolecithin-mediated demyelination using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. cultures for 17 h to induce demyelination. IL-4 (20 ng/mL) or vehicle was added after LPC removal. control cultures were maintained in normal culture media for 7 d. IL-4 nanoparticles were applied through the nasal route (50 g/kg body weight) intranasal administration of IL-4 nanoparticles effectively increased IL-4 protein levels in the brain. IL-4 remained elevated in cortex and striatum until 24 h after IL-4 application. T2-weighted images showed no significant difference in the brain lesion volume of IL-4- versus vehicle-treated mice. similar tissue loss 35 d after stroke in IL-4- and vehicle-treated mice. longitudinal observation of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and calculation of the ratio of FA(ipsilateral)/FA(contralateral) demonstrated progressive white matter injury (ratio 1) with a slow recovery in the EC of vehicle-treated stroke mice at 14\u201335 d after stroke. this trend was observed until day 35 in the ex vivo FA values (Fig 4C) two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc. representative FA map and DEC map of the same ex vivo brains 35 d after stroke. IL-4 treatment significantly increased the MBP+ area in the EC. there was a significant positive correlation between the MBP+ areas and the FA values in the EC. IL-4 post-treatment improves the structural and functional integrity of myelinated fibers after stroke. the g-ratio in small axonal fibers showed a trend toward reduction with IL-4 treatment. IL-4 post-treatment improves the anatomical integrity and physiological function of myelinated fibers after stroke. MCAO+vehicle and MCAO+IL-4 groups at 35 d after surgery. one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc. double immunofluorescent analyses of Nav1.6 and contactin-associated protein revealed the NOR in the EC. the total numbers of normal NOR decreased significantly after stroke in the ipsilateral EC compared to the contralateral EC. IL-4 treatment significantly increased the number of NOR and the paranode length in the ischemic EC. IL-4-treated and vehicle-treated stroke mice showed comparable reductions in latencies to contact and remove adhesive tape from the paw at 3 d after stroke. however, at later time points starting from 7\u201310 d after stroke, IL-4 treatment reduced the time spent touching and removing tapes in stroke mice. IL-4-treated mice showed long-term improvements in cognitive function in the Morris water maze test. IL-4-treated mice showed improved cognitive functions, as reflected by shorter escape times (E, learning) and extension of the time spent in the target quadrant (F, memory) with no change in swim speed (G) 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected at 3\u20136 d after MCAO. oligodendrocytes were recognized by immunostaining with anti-adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) antibodies. a significantly higher ratio of BrdU+APC+ newly generated oligodendrocytes was observed in IL-4-treated mice 35 d after MCAO. the dotted white lines trace the boundaries of the EC. white squares indicate the areas of imaging in the peri-infarct area. IL-4 is known to promote microglia M2 polarization, which in turn enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype (CD206+Iba1+) at 7 and 14 d after stroke. PLX5622 achieved approximately 90% depletion efficacy within a short period. IL-4 treatment increased the number of BrdU+APC+ cells or total BrdU+ cells after stroke in mice fed with the control diet. IL-4 treatment exhibited a trend (p = 0.086) toward lower capacities to increase the number of BrdU+APC+ newly generated oligodendrocytes. intranasal IL-4 did not affect the composition of infiltrated lymphocytes in the brain. IL-4 directly stimulates the differentiation of neuron-glia antigen 2 (NG2)+ OPCs into MBP+ mature oligodendrocytes without the aid of microglia. PPAR is essential for IL-4-induced OPC differentiation in vitro. expression of mbp was assessed by qRT-PCR 3 d after vehicle or IL-4 (20 ng/mL) treatment. pretreatment with IL-4RAbs (20 ng/mL) for 30 min blocked the IL-4-enhanced expression of mbp compared to isotype control antibodies (20 ng/mL) GW9662 (0.5 M) or DMSO (\u201cVeh\u201d) for 30 min, followed by IL-4, vehicle control (PBS), or T3+CNTF for 5 d. PPAR is essential for IL-4-induced OPC differentiation. OPCs were treated with IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 3 d. total RNA extraction from cell pellets was used for the Affymetrix Clariom S rat array. 996 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. PPAR activity, but not PPAR or PPAR activities, was up-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs upon IL-4 treatment. these effects were abolished when IL-4R was blocked with a neutralizing antibody. PPAR inhibitor GW9662 blocked IL-4-induced expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers. expression of Cre was detected in the OPCs of the PPAR-OPC KO mice. the lack of PPAR expression in OPCs did not impair oligodendrocyte replacement after stroke. however, the absence of PPAR in OPCs reduced the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated BrdU+APC+ oligodendrocytes. the data was expressed as the % loss of MBP+ area compared to the MBP+ area of contralateral hemisphere. the dotted white lines trace the boundaries of the EC. IL-4 deficiency impairs white matter integrity after ischemic brain injury. flow cytometry used flow cytometry to assess expression of IL-4R. different markers were used to identify oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages. the percentages of IL-4R+O4+ cells were higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere. imageStream analyses showed IL-4R was expressed on both A2B5+ OPCs and O4+ preoligodendrocytes. IL-4 improves white matter integrity upon demyelination. the fluorescence intensity of MBP (F) and the ratio of SMI32 to MBP immunofluorescence intensity (G) in ipsilesional EC, cortex, striatum. data are normalized to the intensities of contralateral hemispheres. the overall immunofluorescence intensity of MBP staining decreased in the infarct border along three white matter\u2013rich brain regions. the overall immunofluorescence of SMI32 increased in these three regions, resulting in a significant increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio in WT mice after stroke. IL-4 deficiency significantly delayed remyelination in WT brain slices. remyelination was achieved by 7 d following LPC in WT brain slices. IL-4 supplementation significantly enhanced remyelination in WT brain slices. IL-4 liposome nanoparticles were prepared to facilitate the penetration of IL-4 into the ischemic brain. intranasal administration of IL-4 nanoparticles effectively increased IL-4 protein levels in the brain but shows minimal effect on neuronal tissue loss. IL-4 levels were measured in the CC and EC (A), cortex (B), and striatum (C) using ELISA. n = 3\u20134/group. *p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.001, versus vehicle-treated mice. T2-weighted images showed no significant difference in the brain lesion volume of IL-4- versus vehicle-treated mice. the same animals were then killed at 35 d after stroke. serial whole-brain in vivo diffusion tensor imaging scans were collected 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d after MCAO. IL-4 treatment after stroke enhances white matter integrity. yellow arrows indicate the EC. blue arrow heads indicate the IC. intensity in peri-infarct areas is calculated as fold change. data are calculated as fold change compared to contralateral areas. n = 12/group. g-ratio in small axonal fibers (diameter 400 nm) showed a trend toward reduction. IL-4 post-treatment improves the anatomical integrity and physiological function of myelinated fibers after stroke. sham mice treated with vehicle or IL-4 showed significant differences in myelin thickness. g-ratio of myelinated axons with respect to axon diameter at 0.4-m intervals for sham mice or stroke mice treated with vehicle or IL-4. one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc. two-way ANOVA repeated measures followed by Bonferroni post hoc. NOR are characterized by punctate Nav1.6 staining at nodes between the paranodal staining of Caspr. IL-4 treatment significantly increased the number of NOR and the paranode length in the ischemic EC. IL-4-treated and vehicle-treated stroke mice showed comparable reductions in latencies to contact and remove adhesive tape from the paw at 3 d after stroke. IL-4 treatment reduced the time spent touching and removing tapes in stroke mice. poststroke administration of IL-4 improves long-term neurological functions after MCAO. mice received intranasal infusions of IL-4 (50 g/kg) or vehicle 6 h after 60-min MCAO. IL-4 treatment promotes oligodendrogenesis partially independent of microglia/macrophages Successful differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes is important for remyelination. IL-4 treatment promotes oligodendrogenesis in a microglia/macrophage-independent manner. Mice received intranasal infusions of IL-4 nanoparticles (50 g/kg) or vehicle 6 h after MCAO and at daily intervals on days 1\u20137. the dotted white lines trace the boundaries of the EC. n = 7\u20138/group. *p 0.05, ***p 0.001. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc. PLX5622 achieved approximately 90% depletion efficacy within a short period. dietary intake of PLX5622 for 7 d dramatically reduced the number of microglia/macrophages in the brain 21 d after sham or MCAO surgery (28 d after initiation of PLX5622 diet) IL-4 exerts microglia/macrophage-independent effects on oligodendrocyte regeneration after demyelination. intranasal IL-4 administration did not change T-lymphocyte subpopulations or B lymphocytes in the blood. intranasal IL-4 did not affect the composition of infiltrated lymphocytes in the brain. PPAR is essential for IL-4-induced OPC differentiation in vitro. IL-4 at a concentration range of 5\u2013100 ng/mL had no effect on OPC survival. one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc. (J-N) OPCs were treated with the PPAR inhibitor GW9662 (0.5 M) or DMSO (\u201cVeh\u201d) for 30 min, followed by IL-4, vehicle control (PBS), or T3+CNTF for 5 d. PPAR is essential for IL-4-induced oligodendrogenesis. 996 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. 501 were down-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs. enriched GO terms among the down-regulated DEGs in IL-4-treated OPCs represent biological processes such as cell adhesion and motility, cytokine production, cell responses to external stimuli, and cell death. PPAR signaling pathway was dramatically up-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs compared to vehicle-treated cells. PPAR-OPC KO mice were sorted from the brains collected from PPAR-OPC KO mice at 9 d after 4-hydroxytamoxifen injections. the loxp band was abolished in OPCs because of the targeted deletion after Cre-induced recombination. the expression of Cre was detected in the PPAR-OPC KO mice. IL-4 failed to improve long-term sensorimotor (Fig 9I and 9J) deficits. PPAR is essential for IL-4-induced OPC differentiation and long-term functional improvements after stroke. two-way repeated ANOVA (K) or one-way ANOVA (L-M) and Bonferroni post hoc were evaluated in the Morris water maze. n = 7\u20138/group. *p 0.05. a recent study reported the expression of IL-4R surrounding axonal filaments in postmortem brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis [31]. a causal link between IL-4 repletion and white matter integrity might be achieved in two ways: preservation of preexisting white matter structures or enhancement of white matter repair. the results strongly suggest a delayed effect of IL-4 on white matter repair, rather than preservation shortly after injury. IL-4-mediated reconstitution of myelin structure culminated in functional improvements in neural conduction and behavioral performance. despite no changes in the degree of gray matter loss, the IL-4 KO mice do not display deficits in myelin coverage in organotypic brain slice cultures. oligodendrocyte differentiation has been observed until as late as 3 mo after CNS injuries. this prolonged effort may provide a sufficiently wide therapeutic window that allows delayed IL-4 treatment to restore white matter and encourage long-term stroke recovery. PPAR is a master transcription factor known to promote OPC differentiation and maturation. PPAR inhibition abolished the effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation in vivo. the absence of PPAR in OPCs reduced, but did not abolish, the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes in vivo. IL-4-stimulated microglia have been shown to release IL-4 induced 1 (IL4I1), which in turn augments remyelination. direct and indirect effects on microglia/macrophages may contribute to the white matter repair afforded by IL-4. however, repeated IL-4 administration did not change T-lymphocyte subpopulations or B lymphocytes in blood. a series of in vitro studies assessed the effective concentrations of IL-4 in various types of CNS cells. IL-4 inhibits inflammatory responses and boosts trophic factor release in astrocytes at 5\u201310 ng/mL. il-4 directly stimulated OPC differentiation within a concentration range of 5\u2013100 ng/mL. in vitro data support the capacity of IL-4 to directly target OPCs at low concentrations. subcutaneous IL-4 application at 2 g/kg/d or intracerebroventricular application of IL-4 at 60 ng/d significantly improved long-term outcomes. IL-4 promotes oligodendrogenesis and white matter repair in a PPAR-dependent manner. the intranasal route enables CNS IL-4 delivery. it is expected to significantly reduce the risk of peripheral side effects. mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N2O mixture until they were unresponsive in the tail-pinch test. mice were fitted with a nose cone blowing 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N2O mixture under spontaneous breathing for anesthesia maintenance. the mortality during MCAO surgery was 7.6% in WT male mice (12/158), 14.3% in IL-4 KO male mice (1/7), 11.1% in microglia/macrophage-depleted mice (3/27), and 12.5% in PPAR-OPC KO mice (3/24). there was no significant difference in mortality rate across groups. mice were forced to run on a rotating drum with speeds starting at 4 rpm and accelerating to 40 rpm within 400 s. the adhesive removal test was performed to assess tactile responses and sensorimotor asymmetries. two 3-mm adhesive tapes were applied to lesioned forepaws. each mouse was trained on 3 trials (with randomly assigned starting positions) per day to locate the platform for three consecutive days before MCAO. time spent to reach the platform (learning phase) was recorded. time spent in the goal quadrant where platform was previously located was recorded. the process was repeated once for double staining. sections were then washed and mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G or Fluoromount-G. primary antibodies included goat anti-Iba1 (ab5076, Abcam, 1:500, Cambridge, MA, USA), rat anti-CD16 (ab6326, 1:500, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), rabbit anti-NG2 (AB5320, 1:400, Milli anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (115-165-146), anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (712-165-153), anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (712-165-153), anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (711-545-153), anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 (705-545-147), and anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Flour 4 the suspension was passed through a 70-m cell strainer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and resuspended in 30% Percoll (GE Health) single-cell suspensions were separated from myelin and debris by centrifugation. cells at the interface were collected and washed with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) before staining. b-PE-Cy7 (Biolegend, 10126, 1:100), anti-NeuN (Abcam, ab209898, 1:100, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-rabbit IgG BV421 (Biolegend, 406410, 1:100; San Diego, CA, USA), anti-IL-4R PE (R & D Systems, FAB530P, 1:20; Eugene, OR, USA), and anti-A2B5 (R & D Systems Coronal slices (350 m thick) were prepared 1.06 mm from bregma and transferred to an incubation chamber containing pregassed (95% O2/5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 126 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L Na2H2PO4, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 26 mmol/L NaHCO3, 1.3 mmol/L transmission electron microscopy TEM was used to measure myelin thickness in the CC/EC area. mice were perfused with ice-cold saline, followed by 4% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS buffer. samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Araldite resin.
