{"summary": "acute respiratory infections (ARI) result in the death of an estimated 4 to 5 million children each year in developing countries. the major causes of ARI in children and adults are influenza A and B viruses (infA, infB), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV) and rhinovirus. Throat swab samples were collected from the enrolled patients at three hospitals in Guangzhou, southern China between July 2009 and June 2012. the samples were refrigerated at 2 to 8\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice and analyzed immediately or stored at 80\u00b0C before testing. pneumonia was defined as an acute illness with radiographic pulmonary shadowing (at least segmental or in one lobe) by chest radiography. samples were refrigerated at 2 to 8\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice to state key laboratory of Respiratory Diseases. all tests were two-tailed and p0.05 was considered statistically significant. a total of 4242 pediatric patients were analyzed over three years from July 2009 to June 2012. male to female ratio of patients was 1.921.

CP isolates not included in the graph due to few positive cases. ARI is one of the most common human diseases, and the heaviest burden of viral respiratory illness is carried by children. of 6\u201310 viral infections annually and school-age children and adolescents experience 3\u20135 illnesses annually [11]\u2013[12]. MP and CP are the causative agent of atypical pneumonia and have been studied widely in developed countries. however, the characteristics of respiratory pathogens in the etiology of ARI in developing countries are not well studied. infA (428/2361, 18.1%) was the second most frequent pathogen-isolated. infA (428/2361, 18.1%) was the second most frequent pathogen-isolated. EV, MP and ADV were also important pathogens in our study. MP was the fourth most frequent pathogen isolated and tended to increase when RSV was declining. however, both pathogens could be found all year long. an estimated five million LRI occur each year in the united states. co-pathogen infections were found in 503 of the 2361 (21.3%) positive patients. the frequency of the causative pathogens was similar to that among the primary pathogens with the exception of HBoV, HCoV-OC43 and HMPV. the clinical relevance of detection of co-pathogens in pneumonia is uncertain [44]\u2013[47] the attack rate of influenza virus was typically highest in school-age children and daycare populations as has been shown in previous reports [49]\u2013[52]. this probably represents the higher intensity of transmission behavior in this population coupled with a relatively low rate of immunity."}
