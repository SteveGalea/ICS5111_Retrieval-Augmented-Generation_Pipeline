{"summary": "acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza, comprise a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the burden of influenza was greatest in children and the elderly. influenza epidemiology and seasonality have been well characterized. in many parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions such as the united states and Europe, influenza epidemiology and seasonality have been well characterized. north of Oman with a catchment population of approximately 343,707 people began surveillance in January 2008. Ibra Hospital, located in the west of the country with a catchment population of approximately 258,275, joined in September 2008. staff was trained in surveillance methods, including case definitions, screening, obtaining consent, interviewing, sample collection and reporting. cPhysician assessment criteria included severe influenza-like illness, pandemic H1N1 2009, suspected or x-ray confirmed pneumonia, and other respiratory illness. cPhysician assessment criteria included severe influenza-like illness, pandemic H1N1 2009, suspected or x-ray confirmed pneumonia, and other respiratory illness. /OP swabs were placed in the same 15 ml tube containing 2 ml of viral transport media (VTM) both tubes were vigorously agitated for 10 seconds using a vortex mixer. the resulting supernatant was decanted into two sterile cryovials labeled with the case\u2019s study ID number. the CPHL tested all samples using real-time RT-PCR. the peak of influenza activity, during a season, was defined as the month with the highest proportion of SARI cases positive for influenza. the peak of influenza activity, during a season, was defined as the month with the highest proportion of SARI cases positive for influenza. 73.4) (0.5\u201326.3) 5\u201314 years 0 24.3 9.9 8.1 3.3 16.3 3.5 3.3 3.3 5.4 3.5 3.3 0 (15.9\u201337.3) (3.2\u201330.8) (3.9\u201317.0) (0.5\u201323.5) (7.3\u201336.3) (1.1\u201310.8) (0.5\u201323.5) (15\u201349 years 0.9 0.9 1.2 3.7 8.7 5.9 0.2 1.9 0.7 3.5 2.5 0 (0.3\u20132.5 the protocol of the surveillance study was reviewed and approved by the NAMRU-3 Institutional Review Board (IRB), the U.S. CDC IRB, and the National Ethical Review Committee of Oman. surveillance is considered part of the routine, accepted patient care protocols of hospitals, no written informed consent was required. syndromic case definitions were reviewed annually and modified based on changes in WHO guidance and input from partners. in January 2008, the WHO SARI case definition (2006) was used for all cases 5 years of age [8] and for those 31 days of age and 5 years, the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) pneumonia case definition was used [9]. in January 2012, the project case definition for SARI was changed to the revised WHO SARI case definition (2011). bSigns of respiratory infection included abnormal breath sounds, tachypnea, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, sore throat, and dyspnea. cPhysician assessment criteria included severe influenza-like illness, pandemic H1N1 2009, suspected or x-ray confirmed pneumonia, and other respiratory illness. aliquots of samples were sent to the US Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3) laboratory in Cairo for duplicate testing and quality assurance. data from each sentinel site was exported and transmitted to the department of communicable diseases on a weekly basis. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.2 (Cary, NC) Table 2.
