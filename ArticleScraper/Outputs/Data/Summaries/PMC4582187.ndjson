{"summary": "ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) constitutes a main pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. polypeptides destined for disposal via this route bearing ubiquitin chains. ubiquitin itself contains seven lysine residues, each of which can also serve as acceptor sites during ubiquitylation. shuttle ubiquitin receptors bind ubiquitylated proteins through ubiquitin-associated domains (UBAs) ubiquitin receptors simultaneously interact with the proteasome through their ubiquitin-like domains (UBLs) UCH37 appear to preferentially cleave off distal ubiquitin moieties. the recruitment of UCH37 to the proteasome is mediated by the C-terminal region of Rpn13. the UPS plays a central role in protein quality control. a variety of effectors operate upstream of the UPS acting to recognise different classes of defective proteins. current models suggest that BAG6 and SGTA can each recognise a range of hydrophobic substrates located in the cytosol and direct them to an appropriate biosynthetic or degradative route. the normal fate of hydrophobic substrates that are unable to translocate into or across the ER membrane is rapid, BAG6-facilitated, proteasomal degradation. BAG6 facilitates the RNF126-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of MLPs (Hessa et al., 2011; Rodrigo-Brenni et al., 2014) whereas SGTA acts to inhibit MLP degradation, most probably by favouring their deubiquitylation (Leznicki and High, 2012; Wunderley et al., 2014). the binding of exogenous SGTA to Rpn13 results in a substantial increase in the steady-state level of MLPs. inhibiting this interaction by overexpression of the Rpn13 C-terminal region or mutation of the SGTA TPR region negates the effect of SGTA overexpression on MLP levels. purified GST-tagged Rpn13, Rpn131-150 and Rpn13150-407 were used as baits in pull-down experiments primed with lysate from HeLa cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged SGTA. this showed a specific physical interaction of full-length Rpn131-407 and the Rpn13150-407 fragment with exogenous FLAG-SGTA. this approach identified the central region of SGTA, comprising residues 85-210, SGTA interacts with Rpn13 in vivo and in vitro. tetraubiquitin (tetraUb) was used as a positive control for FLAG-Rpn13 binding. ified recombinant SGTA (D) or Rpn13 (E) was incubated with equivalent amounts of indicated purified GST-tagged proteins. immobilised proteins were visualised by Ponceau S staining of the membranes. previous studies have shown that all cellular Rpn13 is incorporated into the proteasome at steady state (Hamazaki et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006) SGTA and Bag6 were transiently overexpressed in HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells together with OP91, an N-terminal fragment of the polytopic membrane protein opsin that acts as an MLP. a marked increase in steady-state OP91 in both HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells. HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteins (lanes 2\u20136) or an empty vector control (lanes 1). Total cell lysates (A) and proteasomal fractions were analysed by western blotting with appropriate antibodies for the presence of the MLP substrate, OP91, exogenous Bag6-V5, exogenous SGTA-V5, endogenous Bag6 and endogen the proteasomal association of this MLP substrate was mirrored by the recruitment of both exogenous and endogenous SGTA to the proteasome. the recovery of exogenous Bag6 with the proteasome appeared unaffected by OP91 co-expression. SGTA binds to a C-terminal region of Rpn13, Rpn13150-407. it is distinct from the N-terminal Pru domain, which interacts with the proteasome and ubiquitin. overexpression of SGTA increases its occupancy of Rpn13, thereby antagonising the proteasomal degradation of MLPs. the Rpn13 C-terminal region inhibits binding of SGTA to the proteasome. parental HEK293T cells (Ai and Aii) or HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells express an exogenous tagged form of Rpn11 (Bi and Bii) were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA5-SGTA-V5 and empty NpFLAG-CMV2 plasmid (lanes substrate levels were examined 22 h post-transfection by quantitative western blotting of total cell lysate. resulting signals normalised to tubulin and plotted relative to the amount of substrate in control cells. overexpressed SGTA and Rpn13 were visualised by western blotting with antibodies recognising the V5 or FLAG tags. ous SGTA had an effect that is comparable with that of Rpn13150-407 for the MLP substrate OPG-TASK85. co-expression of the N-terminal Rpn131-150 domain in combination with SGTA has relatively little effect (Fig. 5A and B, cf. lanes 5, 7 and 8) steady-state levels of Ub-R-GFP were essentially unaltered by any of the combinations tested. a recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type SGTA bound to both full-length Rpn13 and its C-terminal domain. no interaction with the SGTA variant was detected. the amount of the SGTA K160E/R164E mutant recovered with the proteasome was substantially reduced. we also used the SGTA K160E/R164E mutant as an alternative tool. a SGTA mutant that is impaired in proteasome binding is also defective in enhancing MLP levels. a recombinant SGTA mutant was incubated with equivalent amounts of immobilised GST (lane 1) or immobilised GST-tagged Rpn13 derivatives (lanes 2\u20135). cells were harvested the following day and OP91 levels were determined by quantitative western blotting of total cell lysate. the resulting OP91 signals were normalised to tubulin and expressed relative to the amount of substrate in control cells (lane 1) with standard errors for n=3. overexpressed exogenous Pex19 and SGTA variants were also visualised by western blotting for their V5-tag. exogenous FLAG-tagged Rpn13 present in HeLa cell lysate was examined. this approach identified the central region of SGTA as necessary and sufficient for Rpn13 binding. this corresponds to the central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of SGTA. g of purified recombinant SGTA (D) or Rpn13 (E) was incubated with equivalent amounts of indicated purified GST-tagged proteins immobilised on Glutathione Sepharose beads. tetraUb (tetraUb) was used as a positive control for FLAG-Rpn13 binding. a small fraction of endogenous SGTA was recovered with intact proteasomes following their isolation by using a streptavidin pull down. the association of endogenous SGTA with the proteasome was most apparent when cells had been pre-treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to purification. SGTA and Bag6 were transiently overexpressed in HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells together with OP91, an N-terminal fragment of the polytopic membrane protein opsin that acts as an MLP. SGTA co-expression led to a marked increase in steady-state OP91 in both HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells. proteasomal recovery was confirmed by using antibodies against subunits of 20S (20S) and 19S (PSMD1) proteasome as indicated. SGTA are identified, as is overexpressed Bag6-V5 recovered with the proteasome. exogenous bag6 with proteasome appeared unaffected by OP91 co-expression. increased steady-state MLP levels observed upon SGTA overexpression correlate with a specific increase in the binding of both OP91 and SGTA to the proteasome. SGTA binding to Rpn13 regulates MLP stability. exogenous SGTA was expressed under all conditions tested. it was only detected in the proteasome-associated fraction recovered from cells expressing HTBH-tagged Rpn11 after treatment with MG132. overexpression of full-length Rpn13, or of its N-terminal fragment, have far less effect on the proteasomal association of SGTA. cells were treated as indicated with 10 M MG132 or DMSO (solvent control) for 16 h. then total cell lysates (Ai,Bi) or proteasomal fractions isolated under native conditions were prepared. proteasomal recovery was confirmed by western blotting. co-expression of Rpn13150-407 and the MLPs alone led to a reduction in detectable amounts of OP91 and an alternative MLP OPG-TASK85. the effect of Rpn13150-407 co-expression is much more striking when exogenous SGTA is present. despite comparable levels of expression of SGTA and all three Rpn13 variants, steady-state levels of Ub-R-GFP were essentially unaltered by any of the combinations tested. the ability of exogenous SGTA to enhance steady-state MLP levels is strongly dependent upon its binding to the C-terminal region of Rpn13. the SGTA K160E/R164E mutant is defective in its proteasome-mediated association with the proteasome. we used the SGTA K160E/R164E mutant as an alternative tool to test the contribution of the proteasomal binding of SGTA to its role in MLP quality control. immobilised GST-tagged proteins were visualised by western blotting. parental HEK293T cells (Ci, Cii), or HEK293Rpn11-HTBH cells (Di, Dii) were transiently transfected with a control vector (lanes 1 and 2), or plasmids encoding V5-tagged SGTA variants (lanes 3\u20136). SGTA promotes the RNF126-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of MLPs (Hessa et al., 2011; Rodrigo-Brenni et al., 2014) whereas SGTA acts to delay their degradation and promotes the accumulation of deubiquitylated MLPs. we now show that SGTA is selectively recruited to the proteasome through Rpn13. Rpn13150-407 co-expression substantially reduces binding of exogenous SGTA to the proteasome and reverses the SGTA mediated increase in steady-state MLP levels. the heterotrimeric BAG6 complex, composed of Bag6, TRC35 and UBL4A, recognises cytosolic MLPs and stimulates their ubiquitylation. the proximity of the Rpn10 and Rpn13 subunits is consistent with the suggestion that substrates undergo cycles of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation in response to the respective actions of the BAG6 complex and SGTA. the significance of the interaction between SGTA and the proteasome during the quality control of MLPs is further supported by an SGTA variant with an altered TPR region. a single polyubiquitin chain can be captured by both the Rpn10 and Rpn13 ubiquitin receptors. we propose that Rpn13-bound SGTA and Rpn10-bound BAG6 can modulate the access of MLPs to the proteasome. disrupting the interaction of SGTA with the N-terminal UBL of Bag6 reverses the ability of the exogenous protein to stabilise MLPs. UCH37-mediated deubiquitylation can suppress or promote polypeptide degradation in a substrate-specific manner. we speculate that SGTA-dependent cycles of substrate ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation are able to distinguish between aberrantly and correctly folded precursor proteins. SGTA binding and/or SGTA-facilitated deubiquitylation might provide a \u2018rescue pathway\u2019 for endogenous hydrophobic substrates, such as tail-anchored proteins. lecular biology techniques used to clone variants of mouse Rpn13, human Rpn10 and human SGTA into pGEX-4T1 vector. full-length Rpn13 and SGTA were cloned into NpFLAG-CMV2 plasmid. full-length Rpn10 was in pcDNA3.1-myc. mouse anti-SGTA antibody (clone 47-B) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. rabbit anti-GFP, rabbit anti-PSMD1 and chicken anti-Bag6 antibodies were from abcam. mouse anti-V5 antibody was made to order. pre-equilibrated Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) were added to the supernatant, incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and extensively washed with the lysis buffer.
