{"summary": "in recent decades, the spreading disease causes rapid upsurge in morbidity. DF is regarded as the most widely distributed vector-borne disease with the highest morbidity and great harm. phylogeny is a science that makes use of a set of relationships between groups of genes or organisms and reflects their evolutionary history. the gene encoding the E protein has demonstrated its usefulness for decades for the phylogenetic reconstruction of the DENV. since 1990, DENV1 has been isolated from the infected cases. since 2009, all four serotypes were derived from autonomous patients from different outbreak localities in Guangdong Province. in 2014, a total of 45,236 cases of dengue were reported. the aims of our study were explained to all the dengue patients involved (all were adults) and all provided written informed consent. the collection methods of clinical samples and epidemiological data were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Southern Medical University. f (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Primer antisense R (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)

targeted fragments of approximately 856 bp and 1,028 bp were used to amplify E gene cDNA using two pairs of primers. after DNA sequencing, two targeted fragments with overlapping sequences were spliced into a complete E gene sequence. the sequences were saved by DNASTAR and identified by BLAST. two phylogenetic trees for the E gene and one for the complete genome of DENV1 were established. the main focus was the analysis of the molecular characterization during the large 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangdong, China, in 2014. the optimal protein structure model was used to perform protein

trees for the E gene and one for the complete genome of DENV1 were established. the main focus was the analysis of the molecular characterization during the large 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangdong, China. the optimal protein 3D model was selected by combining the Probability density function and discrete optimized protein energy. the model was used to perform protein docking calculations with the GRP78 protein (PDB number: 3LDP) using the ZDOCK algorithm in DS2.5. dengue virus 1 was the major cause of the outbreak of 2014, and it continued to be detected in Guangdong Province as the primary serotype. it continued to be detected in Guangdong Province as the primary serotype, except in 2015. genome ID of strain Origin of strain Genes sequenced City of collection Collection date

Asian genotype I and American/African genotype V. 47 E gene sequences were identified as genotype V with 98.9\u2013100% similarity. they clustered into the same clade, closely related to the DENV1 sequences in Malaysia, Singapore, and India. lineage I involved eight sequences in our collection and other sequences in Singapore and Thailand in recent years. 81 strains in Guangdong constituted the local database. 403 strains in other countries made up the imported database. genomes I, IV, and V were detected since the 2005 dengue epidemic. phylogenetic tree of a local molecular evolution database constructed by the envelope gene in Guangdong since 2005. Genotypes I, IV, and V were detected in 88 genes of DENV1 strains covering every epidemic year. lineage II in Guangdong presented a more complicated epidemic situation in countries around China. a similar lineage characterization was revealed when 27 representative sequences from each lineage of Guangdong clustered into the same lineage. a total of eight uniform AA substitutions in the ectodomain of the protein were concentrated in domains I (five substitutions) (DI) and III (two substitutions) (DIII) between genotypes I and V, whereas domain II (DII) has only one. three-dimensional structure of the E protein of genotypes I and V. circles, lines, and backgrounds: Domain I (purple), Domain II (brown), Domain III (red), transmembrane (white), GRP78 (blue) and three identical docking sites (yellow). since 2005, epidemics of dengue in Guangdong have been characterized by periodic outbreaks, the coexistence of importation and localization, and the significantly increased number of indigenous cases. the incidence peaked in 2006 and 2014, a total of 1,650 cases were reported, with a continuous rising trend in comparison to 544 cases in 2016. average annual number of dengue cases reported by parish since 2005\u20132018 in Guangdong, China. all patients who provided the samples had mild dengue and had no travel history.
