{"summary": "most tests for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis are performed on sputum [2\u20134], which as clinical sample matrix is important for managing cyctic fibrosis patients. most tests for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis are performed on sputum [2\u20134], which as clinical sample matrix is also important for managing cyctic fibrosis patients [5, 6] and detecting and diagnosing respiratory viruses [7, 8], pneumonia [9], and a simple, flexible, automated nucleic acid extraction system can process raw sputum. the aim of this work was to design and develop a benchtop, automated nucleic acid workstation with an integrated mechanical homogenizer/lysis function. it would meet many user needs or requirements defined by the TB community. de-identified, TB-negative sputum remnants from (symptomatic) cystic fibrosis patients were purchased from BioreclamationIVT. unprocessed remnants were used to prepare spiked samples for system development, assay optimization and analytical performance tests. mL heater tubes were pre-filled with the guanidium-based lysis buffer. each row of a 96-well deep-well reagent plate was pre-filled with all remaining reagents necessary to perform nucleic acid binding, wash, and elution functions. patients receiving care at three health centers in Lima, Peru were invited to provide an additional sample for research purposes. a subset of samples was processed on the automated TruTip workstation in Lima, Peru. the remaining volume of de-identified primary sputa and their paired sediment samples were shipped to Akonni on dry ice under an approved CDC import permit. pipetting operations were programmed at 130 L sec-1 flow rate. 1 mL of contrived sample was liquefied by adding an equal volume of 100 g mL-1 dithiothreitol and heating at 37\u00b0C for 20 minutes. purified DNA was stored at -20\u00b0C until use. microtiter plates were loaded onto the thermal cycler, denatured for 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and cycled for 45 cycles of [95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 60 sec] a dilution series of H37Ra genomic DNA was run at least monthly to verify amplification reagents and PCR efficacy. cultured cells were de-clumped by vortexing for 1 min in the presence of 3 mm glass beads. quantified cell suspensions and dilutions were frozen at -20\u00b0C until use. de-identified, TB-negative sputum remnants from cystic fibrosis patients were purchased from BioreclamationIVT. lysis tubes were prepared with 0.3 g inert particles and magnetic stir disc (# 402\u201300100) and stand-alone 2.2 mL heater tubes were pre-filled with the guanidium-based lysis buffer. each row of a polypropylene 96-well deep-well reagent plate was pre-filled with all remaining reagents necessary to perform nucleic acid binding, wash, and elution functions. a subset of samples was processed on the automated TruTip workstation in Lima, Peru. the remaining volume of de-identified primary sputa and their paired sediment samples were shipped to

the sample using simple hardware components. the carriage controls the position of the consumables relative to a fixed-position, 8-channel, custom-built pipetting manifold. a positive-displacement syringe pump controls the speed and aspiration/dispense volumes across all eight tips simultaneously. we were unable to determine the relative effect of MagVor alone on native (non-spiked) specimens. 2 x 108 cells of H37Ra were added to 12 independent sputum samples. we used a commercially-available, manual Norgen Sputum DNA Isolation Kit as a benchmark of performance rather than a head-to-head comparator. the automated workstation can repeatedly and reliably extract M. tuberculosis-detectable DNA from sputum containing between 16 and 80 CFU mL-1. sputum samples ranged from saliva-like to hemoptoic (containing blood), with most samples characterized as mucoid (mucus-like) or mucopurulent (containing mucus and pus) one of the AFB smear positive (+), solid culture positive (+) sputum samples was consumed in its entirety during NALC-NaOH decontamination, leaving 123 sputum extracts and 124 sediment extracts for automated nucleic acid extraction. extracts generating real time Ct

showed no difference in Ct values over a range of DNA input concentrations. in combination, these data indicate that amplification or fluorescent inhibitors (if present) were not detectable or negatively influencing reported Ct values over the course of this study. sputum nucleic acid sample preparation can also be automated on a personal, electronic pipette. nasopharyngeal aspirate, swab, blood, plasma and saliva protocols can be easily transferred to the automated workstation reported here with integrated heater."}
