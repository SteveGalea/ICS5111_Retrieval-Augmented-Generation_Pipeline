{"summary": "in this study, we collected 74 human MERS-CoV whole genome sequences from 9 countries. the majority of them are from the countries in Arabian Peninsula (78.4%, 58/74) and more than half of them are from Saudi Arabia (64.9%, 48/74) the peak season for MERS is between April (26.5%) and may (25.0%) the tree was constructed with maximum-likelihood method. the camel MERS-CoV isolated in Egypt is basal to clade A and B. different shaded colors mean different potential recombinant types. type 3 means the recombination happened between group I and group III. type 4, 5 and 6 are the recombination happened between different genomic regions of group IV and group V. there is no recombination found in phylogenetic group I and group IV. nine positive selection sites in spike (S) glycoprotein are found in spike (S) glycoprotein. there is no significant positive selection in other MERS-CoV genes. six significant positive selection sites are located in receptor binding domain of S protein. positive selection sites (PSS)# S 16251.74 16207.52 0.001 141R, 270Y*, 419S**, 436N*, 472S*, 479L*, 511R**, 521N*, 775S* N 4449.82 4449.64 p >0.05 NULL M 2051.31 2051.14 p >0.05 NULL E 703.78 703.17 p >0.05 8Q, 11S, 56I 8 16 20602.67 P > 0.05 NS 20604.16 20602.67 P > 0.05 NS 1b 10846.50 10846.48 P > 0.05 NS 3 561.10 560.43 P > 0.05 86P 561.11 560.43 P > 0.05 86P 4a 521.41 520.06 P > 0.05 NS 4b 1018.79 1018.53 P > 0.05 NS 5 1062.76 1062.75 the genome-wide average nucleotide substitution rate was 4.81 104 substitutions per site per year. the genome-wide average nucleotide substitution rate of camel and human MERS-CoVs was 4.81 104 substitutions per site per year. the ancestral host state with time reference was estimated for each tree node. the possible transmission time for each node and its 95% highest posterior density (HPD) are shown in Fig. 3b. the x-intercept (tMRCA) is 1995 with an R2 of 0.874. blue, red, yellow, green and cyan represent camel MERS-CoV, human MERS-CoV, hedgehog MERS-CoV, bat Neoromicia capensis and MERS-CoV. a single camel MERS-CoV isolated in Egypt forms a basal paraphyletic group to all camel and human MERS-CoV clade. the human-camel MERS-CoV cluster can be further divided into two clades\u2014clade A and clade B. recombination of MERS-CoV We performed the recombination analysis on the collected full-length MERS-CoV sequences. there are 28 potential recombinant types (30.4%, 28/92) including three camel MERS-CoVs and 25 human MERS-CoVs. adaptive evolution analysis for all MERS-CoV proteins in absence of recombinant strains. we set camel and human MERS-CoVs as the foreground branch and bat and hedgehog MERS-CoVs as the background branch to preform branch-site test in CODEML of PAML program. strong positive selection is detected in spike (S) glycoprotein between these two branches (p 0.001). Q419S, G436N, D472S and R479L are in the core sub-domain. we also detected a positive selection site in S protein\u2019s c-terminal, L775S. *means PP > 0.95, **means PP > 0.99.

MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein evolves slightly faster than genome-wide average rate. this indicates that the nucleotide substitution rate of MERS-CoV S protein still maintains a fast speed even after it crossed the species boundary. the appearance of the common ancestor of human-camel MERS-CoV is in 2010. in clade B, we detected five possible human-to-camel transmission events and one camel-to-human transmission event. there is at least one confirmed case of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission32. genome alignment and phylogenetic analysis Total 93 collected genomic sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE software with default parameters. clade B estimated consensus sequences for every phylogenetic group using cons tool in EMBOSS explorer. random sampling was performed on 68 human and camel MERS-CoVs (clade A and B) which are all non-recombinant sequences. the random sampled sequences together with bat and hedgehog MERS-CoVs were used to generate the datasets for branch-site model analysis. a relaxed molecular clock with an uncorrelated log-normal distribution was also used in Bayesian coalescence analysis. a constant population size model was used in Bayesian coalescence analysis. a MCMC analysis was run for 500/100 million generations for hosts/geographic transmission. we used the JmodelTest 3.1 to estimate the best nucleotide substitution model for our alignment36. the branch support values were calculated with Shimodaira-Hasegawa test integrated in PHYML. 68 human and camel MERS-CoVs (clade A and B) are non-recombinant sequences. we used 10, 20 and 50 as the random sample size with and without replacement. each random sample size, we repeatedly drew five times in order to make results robust. MCMC analysis was run for 500/100 million generations for hosts/geographic transmission. initial 25% samples were discarded as burn-in. root-to-tip analysis was performed with Path-O-Gen software."}
