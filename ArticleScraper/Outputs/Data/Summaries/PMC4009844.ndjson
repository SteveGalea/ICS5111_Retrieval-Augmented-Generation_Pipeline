{"summary": "the Z-curve theory is a geometric approach to genome analysis. the 3-dimensional curve represents a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. the analysis of a DNA sequence can then be performed through studying the corresponding Z-curve. the number of possible combinations when taking 2 bases at a time from 4 bases is 6. The 6 combinations are: R (A/G) and Y (C/T); M (A/C) and K (G/T); W (A/T) and S (G/C), where R, Y, M, K, W and S represent the bases of puRine, pYrimidine, aMino, Keto, Weak hydrogen bonds. readers may cut (Fig. 2B) and fold it along the dashed lines. the regular tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron ACGT. the vertex A of the tetrahedron is also the vertex of the cube. a tetrahedron group is a geometric entity of high symmetry. all possible rotational motions which keep the tetrahedron fixed in the space form a group, called a tetrahedron group or T-group. a point with coordinates x, y and z will be transformed accordingly. the K4 group and its cosets exhaust the T-group. all the 12 elements of the T-group can be divided into four classes, which are (I), (Rx,Ry, Rz), (RA, RC, RG, RT) and (R2A, R2C, R2G, R2T) the four bases A, C, G and T are assigned to the four vertices of the tetrahedron. the four characters A, C, G and T will be transformed accordingly under the 12 operational elements of the DNA group or the A4 group. both the A4 group and the T-group are called the DNA group. b 11 a + b 12 c + b 13 g + b 14 t, Z = c 11 a + c 12 c + b 13 g + b 14 t, Z = c 11 a + c 12 c + c 13 g + c 14 t, (2) where a11, a12,..., c13, c14 are real coefficients. eqs. (2) can be re-written the Z-transform formulas transform the four base frequencies into three coordinates of a point (called a mapping point) in a three-dimensional space. the reduced coordinate system eqs. (6), unless otherwise indicated, can be also re-written as a matrix form. a c g t = 1 4 ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 projections of four edges AG, AC, CT and GT form the four sides of the square, whereas those of AT and GC form the two diagonal lines of the square. similar results for (Fig. 3A) are summarized as follows. i d e T C : c + t = 1, a = g = 0. x > 0, a + g > 1 / 2. y > 0, a + c > 1 / 2. similar deductions are left out for readers who might be interested in doing so. similar deductions for the annotation are left out for readers who might be interested in doing so. transform matrix (3x4) eq. (8a) and its variants constitute a one-to-one representation to each element of the DNA group. a rotation of 180\u00b0 along the x-axis leads to the original state. for this purpose, eq. (8a) can be re-written. as Z = ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 based on the 12 Z matrices, we have Z i V = R i U, i = I, x, y, z, A, C, G, T, A 2, C 2, G 2, T 2. Note that each Zi corresponds to each Ri by a way of one-to-one correspondence. the Z-transform formulas are the core of the Z-curve theory. y z = Z ( p ( A ) p ( C ) p ( G ) p ( T ) ), a = p ( A ), c = p ( C ), g = p ( G ), t = p ( T ). here we have 3 (= 3x4\u00b0) parameters. the case of tri-nucleotides ( x H y H z H ) = Z ( p ( H p(HIJKLA) represents occurrence frequencies of the six-nucleotide HIJKLA. here we have 192 (=3x43) parameters. the case of penta-nucleotides ( x H I J K L y H I J K L z H I J K L ) = Z ( p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L z H J K L ). for most applications, there are six possible choices V = ( V 1, V 1 V 2, V 1 V 2 V 3, V 1 V 2 V 3 V 4, V 1 V 2 V 3 V 4, V 1 V 2 V 3 V 4 V 5, V 1 V 2 V 3 V 4 V 5 V 6, ) (22) where the symbol represents the direct sum of two spaces. (26) S, named as \u201cgenome order index\u201d [7], is useful for designing a fast genome segmentation algorithm [8, 9]. the surface of the inscribed sphere is described by the equation x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = ( 1 3 ) 2 = 1 3. The Z-curve One of the most important applications is to derive the equation of the Z-curve. y n = ( A n + C n ), z n = ( A n + T n ), z n = ( A n + T n ), n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...., N, x x, y n, z n. the corresponding DNA sequence can be reconstructed uniquely from the so-called inverse Z-transform formulas. the three components of the Z-curve, xn, yn and zn represent three independent distributions, that is, those of purine/pyrimidine (R/Y), amino/keto (M/K) and strong-H bond/weak-H bond (S/W) bases. they completely describe the DNA sequence being studied. the GC Profile For most genome sequences, Chargaff Parity Rule II holds, i.e., A N T N a n d C N G N, where N is the length of a genome or a chromosome. the curves of zn n are roughly straight lines in this case. both quantities of z \u2032 n and n can be calculated by using the z\u2019 curve. it is clear to see from eq. that a jump in the z\u2019 curve indicates a decrease of G+C content or an increase of A+T content. the region n is usually chosen to be a fragment of a DNA sequence. the square of Euclidean distance between the two points is denoted by D, where D ( n) = ( x r x l ) 2 + ( y r y l ) 2 + ( z r z l ) 2 (38) where C is a constant, the same procedure is applied to both the left and right sub-sequences recursively until D(n) is less than a given threshold. a software, called GC-Profile, was developed to implement the algorithm for genome segmentation. the algorithm is composed of 4 types of nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. the number of possible combinations when taking 2 bases at a time from 4 bases is 6. if a 3-dimensional graph is adopted, the regular cube appears to be the unique choice to represent the symmetry. each face of the cube is assigned to one, and only one, of the six characters. readers may cut (Fig. 2B) and fold it along the dashed lines. the line connecting the middle point of an edge and that of the opposite edge of the tetrahedron is called the middle line. the cube-tetrahedron geometric entity established here correctly reflects the symmetry of the four DNA bases. a tetrahedron group consists of 12 operational elements, which are described below. the four elements I, Rx, Ry and Rz form an invariant subgroup of the T-group, which is isomorphic to the Klein-4 group, or K4 group. the K4 group and its cosets exhaust the T-group. the 12 elements of the T-group can be divided into four classes. the four bases A, C, G and T are assigned to the four vertices of the tetrahedron. the occurrence frequencies of the four bases, A, C, G and T in a DNA sequence are denoted by a, c, g and t. the normalized condition reads a + c + g + g + g + g + g + g. a, c, g and t are the coordinates of a point P in the coordinate system shown in Fig. 2D. Suppose that X, Y and Z are the coordinates of a point P in the coordinate system shown in (Fig. 2D), which can be expressed by a linear combination of the four frequencies a, c, g and t. the edge length of the cube is 3 / 2 ( X Y Z ) = 3 4 ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 eqs. (6a) can be re-written as a matrix form ( x y z ) = ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 projection of six edges onto any coordinate plane forms a regular square. the projection of four vertices of the tetrahedron forms four vertices of the square. it should be noted that A, C, G and T are sometimes used to denote DNA bases. i d e e r t e x : t = 1, a = c = t = 0. i d e e r t e x : t = 1, a = c = t = 0. e x : a + g = 1 / 2. a d r a n t h q u a d r a n t : a + g > 1 / 2 and g + t > 1 / 2. a d r a n t : a + g o n a l A O : g = c. a rotation of 180\u00b0 along the x-axis leads to the original state, i.e., R x R x = I ( 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 transform matrix (3x4) eq. (8a) and its variants constitute a one-to-one representation to each element of the DNA group. eq. (8a) can be re-written as Z = ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 based on the 12 Z matrices, we have Z i V = R i U, i = I, x, y, z, A, C, G, T, A 2, C 2, G 2, T 2. Note that each Zi corresponds to each Ri by a way of one-to-one correspondence. however, the similar multiplication relation such as eq. (13) does not exist among the Z matrices. the Z-transform formulas should be extended to consider the correlations of multiple nucleotides. the case of di-nucleotides ( x H y H z H ) = Z ( p ( H A ) p ( H C ) p ( H I C ) p ( H I C ) p ( H I G ) p ( H I T ). the case of penta-nucleotides ( x H I J K L y H I J K L z H J I K L ) = Z ( p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( H I J K L ) p ( p(HIJKLA) represents occurrence frequencies of multiple nucleotides for a given DNA sequence. we use a moving window with size = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. eqs. (16) to (21), and then the Z-curve parameters can be obtained. x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4 S 1, (25) where S is defined by S = a 2 + c 2 + g 2 + t 2. (26) S, named as \u201cgenome order index\u201d [7], is useful for designing a fast genome segmentation algorithm. we define A0=C0=G0=T0=0, therefore, x0 = y0 = z0 = 0. The Z-curve is defined as the connection of the nodes P0 (x0, y0, z0),, P2 (x2, y2, z2),..., PN(xN, yN, zN, zN) one by one sequentially with straight lines. the three components of the Z-curve, xn, yn and zn represent three independent distributions. they represent those of purine/pyrimidine (R/Y), amino/keto (M/K) and strong-H bond/weak-H bond (S/W) bases. the ry and yn components are termed RY and MK disparity curves. the AT and GC disparity curves are defined by (xn + yn)/2 and (xn-yn)/2, which shows the excess of A over T and G over C along the genome. the essence of the z\u2019 curve is to display the variations of the G+C content along a genome or chromosome based on the cumulative count of G and C bases. G + C = 1 2 ( 1 k z \u2032 n n n n ) 1 2 ( 1 k k \u2032 ), (36) where is the average slope of the z\u2019 curve within the region n. the frequencies are mapped onto two points, PR (xr, yr, zr) and PL(xl, yl, zl) in a 3-D space, where ( x i y i z i ) = ( 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 the segmentation algorithm is recursive, i.e., after n* is determined, the same procedure is applied to both the left and right sub-sequences recursively. the same procedure is applied to both the left and right sub-sequences recursively, until D(n) is less than a given threshold. bacter baumannii [17], Variovorax paradoxus [18], Streptomyces tendae [21], Phaeobacter gallaeciensis [22], Desulfobacterium autotrophicum [23], Desulfobacterium autotrophicum [23], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24], Beggiatoa [26] Archaea Archaea of the ANME-1 group [27] Eukaryo thermococcus sibiricus [75], Sulfolobus islandicus [76] Bacteria Moraxella catarrhalis [79], Sorangium cellulosum [80], Microcystis aeruginosa [80], Cyanothece [81], Cupriavidus metallidurans [82], Variovorax paradoxus [18], Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis [84], [85], Legion archaea, eukaryotes and viruses Bacillus cereus [103], Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 [119], Coronavirus [118], human immunodeficiency virus [120], human [121,143], E. coli [122], Aeropyrum pernix K1 [124], Streptomyces coelicolor [125]. the occurrence frequencies of 4 bases in a DNA sequence are mapped onto a point in a 3-dimensional (3-D) or 15-, 63-, 255-, 1023- and 4095-D space. the first application was for gene recognition in the budding yeast genome, where a 3-D space (eqs. (16) was adopted. since the protein coding sequence has 3 phases, the 3 Z-curve parameters are expanded to 9 (3x3) parameters. ZCURVE_V is an ab initio gene-finding software for bacterial and archaeal genomes. based on 9 Z-curve parameters, ZCURVE_V was developed for identifying protein-coding genes in viral and phage genomes. ZCURVE_CoV was developed for gene-finding in coronavirus genomes. ZCURVE_V and ZCURVE_CoV have been widely used for annotating protein-coding genes in newly sequenced genomes of viruses, coronaviruses [28, 33-37] and SARS coronaviruses [38-53]. the algorithm based on the Z-curve theory has also been used in recognizing short coding sequences of human genes [56]. x n = x n + 1 x n = 1, y n = y n = 1 a n d z n = 1 a n d z n = 1. method was used to detect introns in the C. elegance chromosome III [60], and was later improved by using an adaptive filter to predict the exons in DNA sequences. the Z-curve method has been commonly used for annotating newly sequenced archaeal genomes. the GC-skew [77] is a special case of the Z-curve. the Z-curve can reveal nucleotide asymmetry that is not detectable by GC skew [70] Ori-Finder has become a commonly used annotation tool for identifying oriCs in newly sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes. it was found that long domains of relatively homogenous G+C content exist, and these domains are referred to as isochores [91, 92]. technique of wavelet multi-resolution analysis was used to identify isochore boundaries in the human genome. a clear domain structure is revealed by the GC profile in chromosome 11 of finch. other groups also used GC-Profile to study isochores in the pig genome. the GC profile method has also been used for identification of GIs in other genomes. it is likely that methods based on the same principle can also be used to recognize TSS in archaea and eukaryotes. a self-training method was proposed to find TSS with high accuracy. human chromosome 6 and chimpanzee chromosome 6 are homologous. the 2 homologous chromosomes show similar Z-curve patterns. the base composition of a DNA sequence can be represented by a point in a 3-D space, thus providing an intuitive method to display base compositions. the method was used to study the codon usage in the genomes of AIDS virus [120], human [121], E. coli [122], Vibrio cholerae [123], Aeropyrum pernix K1 [124], Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [125] and seven GC-rich bacteria. the Z-curve algorithm was first applied to recognize protein coding genes in the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome with an accuracy better than 95%. the same algorithm achieved an accuracy rate over 98% in the Vibrio cholerae genome, based on 9 parameters only [13] ZCURVE 1.0 was also used for annotating archaeal genomes. for some genomes, e.g., those of the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra [24] and Me Tri virus [28] ZCURVE 1.0 is integrated into meta-gene-finding tool YACOP [31] and GARSA [32]. algorithm based on the 189 Z-curve parameters was shown to be the most accurate among those tested for a given database. the second algorithm was an algorithm based on the Markov chain of order five [56], and the result was later confirmed by an independent study [57]. ZCURVE 1.0 is an ab initio gene-finding software for bacterial and archaeal genomes. based on the 9 Z-curve parameters, ZCURVE_V was developed for identifying protein-coding genes in viral and phage genomes. the software, ZCURVE_CoV, was developed for gene-finding in coronavirus genomes. ZCURVE 1.0 is integrated into meta-gene-finding tool YACOP [31] and GARSA [32]. Similarly, ZCURVE_V and ZCURVE_CoV have been widely used for annotating protein-coding genes in newly sequenced genomes of viruses, coronaviruses and SARS coronaviruses. x n = x n + 1 x n = 1, y n = y n + 1 a n d z n = 1 a n d z n = z n + 1 z n = 1. a lengthen-shuffle FFT algorithm was proposed for finding protein coding regions. the Z-curve method has been commonly used for annotating newly sequenced archaeal genomes. the Z-curve contains all the information of its corresponding DNA sequence. the GC-skew [77] is a special case of the Z-curve. the bacterium Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhi str. CT18 shows C. the domain structure in chromosome 11 of finch, and D) horizontally-transferred genomic elements in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 700669. Ori-Finder has become a commonly used annotation tool for identifying oriCs in newly sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes. occus jannaschii was the first to have its genome sequenced. the Z-curve method predicted 2 oriCs [68] that were supported by experimental evidence. a single oriC in the genome of A. pernix [70] were also supported by experimental evidence. Ori-Finder is an integrated in silico method to predict oriC regions of bacterial genomes. it has become a commonly used annotation tool for identifying oriCs in newly sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes. in the human genome, it was found that long domains of relatively homogenous G+C content exist, and these domains are referred to as isochores. the GC profile was used to study isochore structures in genomes of human [94], mouse [95], Arabidopsis thaliana [96] and chicken [97]. a clear domain structure is revealed by the GC profile in chromosome 11 of finch [98] and to assess DNA curvature profiles for Aspergillus fumigatus [100]. corynebacterium efficiens can grow and produce glutamate at temperature above 40\u00b0C. unexpectedly, however, an aspartate kinase is less thermostable. a self-training method was proposed to find TSS with high accuracy. ve algorithm has been used to construct a genome-wide dynamic nucleosome positioning map for the budding yeast. by using the Z-curve, features of related DNA sequences can be grasped quickly in a perceivable form [1, 2]. a typical example is the visualization of the genomes of related SARS-coronaviruses. principal component analysis for the genomes of Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 (C) and Streptomyces avermitilis MA 4680 (D) shown are principal component analysis for the genomes of Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 (C) and Streptomyces avermitilis MA 4680 (D) the set of all three components can be used in identifications of protein-coding genes, promoters, translational start sites or other bioinformatics issues. further applications are expected to benefit from the use of functions based on the three components, i.e., f (x, y, z), with potential integration of other parameters."}
