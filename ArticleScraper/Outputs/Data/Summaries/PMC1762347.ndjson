{"summary": "a large fraction of described pathogens of humans, animals and plants are generalists. the ability to infect different hosts conditions the epidemiology and pathogenicity of generalist pathogens. the distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range may vary largely. multiple infections will be a factor in pathogen evolution. theoretical analyses predict that the within-host dynamics of microparasites in multiple infected hosts may have important consequences in evolution of their virulence [11]\u2013[14] there is evidence that multiple infection may result in either increased or reduced virulence. the aphid transmitted viruses Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV, genus Alfamovirus, family Bromoviridae), Beet western yellows virus (BWYV, genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, genus Cucumovirus, family Bromoviridae) and Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV, genus Potyvirus, family Bunyaviridae) are transmitted table 1 shows the number of samples analysed and the number of infected plants by each of these five virus species in the 21 most frequently found plant species in three monitored habitats. single and multiple infections with AMV, BWYV, CMV, TSWV and WMV in twenty one weed species. 0 3 0 Plantago sp 61 7 6 7 4 0 1 3 1 Portulaca oleracea L. 7 0 0 5 0 0 Solanum nigrum L. 24 0 0 4 0 0 Trifolium pratense L. 37 1 0 2 1 1 Xanthium strumarium Moretti. the more host-selective viruses were those with a highest prevalence in the analysed ecosystem. the index of selectivity of the host (ISH) was calculated for the 21 host plant species in Table 1. a positive correlation between both parameters was found.

Xsik and Xaik the number of analysed individuals of host k that are infected only by pathogen i (single infections) and by pathogen i and at least another one (associated infections), respectively, (Xsik = Xsik+Xaik) this index has a range from one to minus one and an expected value, under the null hypothesis, of zero. the significance of the observation can be estimated as a one-tail test from the binomial above. to test for association of different pathogens within a host, we follow the same process as the expectation of a sum of observations will be equal to their expectations. the frequency of pathogen i in host k can be estimated as: which equals the above defined prevalence. the association index (AI) for pathogen i in host k is the difference between the proportion of samples that being infected also by at least another pathogen (Xaik/Xik), minus the expectation of this proportion under the null hypothesis (paik) sum of observations will be equal to the sum of their expectations. corresponding sums of observations will be binomially distributed given the Xik. chi-squared tests of 2x N contingency tables were analysed."}
