{"summary": "etiology remains to be elucidated, and epidemiological studies have shown that it is more frequently observed in winter [2]. the disease occurs worldwide, but its incidence is 10 times higher in Japan than in western countries [3], suggesting that race-specific genotypes might be associated with the disease. a pathological study showed that lymph node biopsy from KD patients showed focal necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration. this observation implied that lymphoadenopathy is a symptom of the acute phase of KD. however, lymph node biopsy is rarely performed in KD patients, because KD is usually diagnosed by clinical symptoms. the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. the patient was positive for 5 markers (fever, conjunctiva, exanthema, strawberry tongue, and lymphadenopathy) at day 10 from the appearance of their earliest symptom. HHV-6) (P101; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) were used as primary antibodies. labeled avidin-biotin method was used to detect virus antigens. in situ hybridization was performed to detect EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) as described previously. all sequencing runs for 75-80 mers were performed with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequencing kit. all sequencing runs for 75-80 mers were performed with the Illumina base-calling pipeline 1.4.0. the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. the patient was positive for 5 markers (fever, conjunctiva, exanthema, strawberry tongue, and lymphadenopathy) at day 10 from the appearance of their earliest symptom. the labeled avidin-biotin method was used to detect virus antigens. in situ hybridization was performed to detect EBV-encoded small RNA. total nucleic acid preparation from specimens was prepared from a FFPE 7-mm cube. all sequencing runs for 75-80 mers were performed with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequencing kit. fluorescent images were analyzed using the Illumina base-calling pipeline 1.4.0. the necrotic area contained many necrotic ghost cells with hemorrhage and infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages. the lymph node capsule was thickened with inflammatory cell infiltration. no bacteria or fungi were detected by PAS, Gram and Giemsa staining. mimivirus RNA viruses Filoviruses: Ebola virus, Marburg virus - Bunyaviruses: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, sin nombre virus - Arenaviruses: Lassa virus, Junin, Guanarito, Machupo and Sabia viruses - togaviruses: enterovirus 68 and 71; poliovirus 1-3; coxsackievirus A2-A6, A8-A genus classification was determined from the results of a BLASTN search. the most abundant bacteria in both DNA and RNA samples were from the genera Methylotenera, Cytophaga, Flavobacterium and Polynucleobacter. the most abundant bacteria were from the genera Methylotenera, Cytophaga, Flavobacterium and Polynucleobacter. sequencing reads from lymph node DNA or RNA samples were analyzed with athreshold score of 50.0. no virus genome was detected by the direct sequencing. multivirus real-time PCR can detect >160 DNA and RNA viruses. RNA extracted from lymph nodes was negative for all RNA viruses. internal control RNA (hGAPDH mRNA) was detected. enterovirus 68 and 71; poliovirus 1-3; coxsackievirus A2-A6, A8-A10, A16, A21, A24, B1-B6; echovirus 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13-18, 25, 30; parechovirus 1 and 3; rhinovirus A and B; rotavirus; reovirus 1-4; Melaka virus; Colorado tick borne fever virus. the next-generation sequencing system produced several million 75-mer reads from the DNA or ds-cDNA libraries. 99.59% and 77.43% of the sequences from the DNA and RNA samples were originated from a possible human source. the remaining reads were further analyzed using a BLASTN search against non-redundant databases, revealing potential bacterial and viral sequences. RNA samples were analyzed by BLASTN homology search with athreshold score of 50.0. the similarity results were classified into 11 and 653 genera of archaea and bacteria,respectively. the phylum taxonomy of the bacteria is shown below the dot plot. the next-generation sequencer identified Streptococcus spp. in the lymph node as one of the probable suspected pathogens for the pathogenesis of KD. some oral Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae TTV was originally identified as an etiological agent of hepatitis [46,47] but has been detected frequently in various tissues and even from healthy individuals [48,49] thus, it should not be thought of as an etiological agent of KD. increased copy numbers of TTV have been found in some disease tissues, suggesting that TTV is activated under certain conditions in some diseases. further studies are required to clarify the association of TTV infection and KD pathogenesis in the lymph"}
