{"summary": "the potyviridae family is the largest group of plant RNA viruses. their single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome consists of a single molecule in most cases, with just a few exceptions of viruses having a bipartite genome (1, 2). members of the genus Potyvirus have a monopartite genome of approximately 10 kb flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions (NCRs) the CP from the potyvirus Pepper vein banding virus produced in Escherichia coli can encapsidate its own mRNA but with very low efficiency. some evidence suggests that coating of the potyviral RNA begins near its 5\u2032 terminus (19), but no potyviral origin of assembly or packaging signal has been identified yet. PPV CP forms stable particles in plant cells only when it is coexpressed with a replication-competent viral RNA. PPV CP expressed from pLONG, a plasmid that carries the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs flanking the coding sequence of a truncated PPV polyprotein starting in P3, is stable just when it is coexpressed with PPV HCPro. the cognate viral genome, remained stable after the indicated incubation period (Fig. 2A) the constitutive 35S promoter from Cauliflower mosaic virus is shown as a black arrow. gray boxes represent cistrons of the indicated viral proteins. a green bar between viral cistrons denotes the presence of the GFP reporter. extracts from N. benthamiana leaves were loaded on the gradient immediately after being prepared (0\u2032) or after 60 min of incubation at 25\u00b0C (60\u2032) a pool of the indicated fractions was observed under the electron microscope. PPV CP was transiently produced as a GFP-CP fusion. CP was detected in pellets. no increase over time in the levels of CP was observed in pellets. instability of PPV CP in the absence of its cognate HCPro correlates with a defective yield of viral particles (20). measurements of virions in fractions 6 to 8 indicated that they were slightly shorter than those produced by the wild-type PPV. this is compatible with the encapsidation of a shorter RNA. this sedimentation profile was not drastically altered by the ex vivo incubation. the only difference was that the amount of CP in fractions 1 to 3 dropped after incubation. CP from NIb-GFP-CP was readily separated from GFP by action of the NIaPro proteinase, but it was rapidly degraded during the in vitro incubation of the native extract. CP produced from LONG(P3-6K1) and LONG(P3-CI) showed high degradation rates during the in vitro incubation. P3 and 6K1 from the viral polyprotein is enough to promote PPV CP instability even in the presence of HCPro. we analyzed whether the simple fusion of P3-6K1 to GFP-CP together with pLONG(P3-6K1) stabilizes to CP as pLONG does. the accumulation of PPV CP extracted under denaturing or native conditions appeared to be lower than that produced from LONG. the amino acid sequence of P3, rather than P3N-PIPO or the P3 nucleotide sequence, is required to preserve the stability of PPV CP produced in the presence of HCPro. conditions from tissues expressing wild-type and mutant versions of LONG were tested by immunoblot analysis. the levels of CP extracted with SDS buffer were similar in all cases independently of the LONG version and the presence of either PPV P1HCPro or CVYV P1b. as expected, CP was unstable independently of its source construct when P1b was used to suppress RNA silencing. analysis of the stability of the CP produced by agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with pLONG or pLONG(PIPO) along with other constructs. extracts prepared in SDS buffer and the time, in minutes, elapsed after extraction with phosphate buffer are indicated. CP was expressed from the wild-type LONG or LONG(P3) in the presence of either PPV HCPro or CVYV P1b. no degradation of CP was observed after 30 min of incubation. this result rules out the possibility that a specific nucleotide sequence located at the 5\u2032-terminal region of the P3 cistron confers stability to PPV CP in the presence of HCPro. extracts of N. benthamiana were loaded on the gradient immediately after being prepared (0\u2032) or after 60 min of incubation at 25\u00b0C (60\u2032). asterisk indicates that the membrane was overexposed. instability of PPV CP produced in the absence of the N-terminal region of P3 is associated with a defect in the formation of virion-like particles. PPV CP produced in the presence of a truncated P3 is unable to be assembled in structures similar to viral particles. the viral RNA encoded by pLONG is able to replicate and spread locally in the presence of HCPro. this last combination is unable to establish a systemic infection. suppression activity of HCPro is needed for the movement of pLONG from the delivery area to the neighbor cells. in this particular case, we expressed a variant of pLONG that carries a mutated version of CI (KS91,92AA) that inhibits PPV replication. mutations introduced in the GA6 slippage motif abolished cell-to-cell movement of pLONG. pLONG(PIPO) is not expressing P3N-PIPO. RNA replication is an essential requirement for CP stability and formation of viral particles. the CP produced from LONG(CIKS) was transiently expressed along with P1HCPro. CP accumulation and stability were further assessed by immunoblot detection. extracts prepared in phosphate buffer were loaded on the gradient immediately after being prepared (0\u2032, 30\u2032, or 60\u2032) CP did not migrate in gradient fractions 6 to 8 (Fig. 2E) in both cases, CP did not migrate in gradient fractions 6 to 8. mutation KS91,92AA in CI affects a putative role of this viral protein in the formation of virions independently of its known function. the CP that was derived from NIbGDD was degraded when native extracts were incubated for 30 min at 25\u00b0C. to verify whether the instability of CP associated with the RNA replication deficiency also occurred when it was expressed from a complete viral genome. PPV CP produced by a nonreplicating RNA is assembled in stable particles as long as it is expressed in the presence of a replicating viral RNA. native and denatured extracts were prepared from N. benthamiana tissues transiently expressing both wild-type and mutant LONG variants. pLONG(CPD) and pLONG-(CPRQ) showed lower accumulation levels than the wild-type CP. CP produced from nonreplicating RNA encoded by pGFP-CP accumulates to high levels, but it is highly unstable and unable to form virion-like particles. CP accumulation and stability were determined by immunoblot analysis of native extracts and denatured extracts. PPV CP expressed from pLONG, a plasmid that carries the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs flanking the coding sequence of a truncated PPV polyprotein starting in P3, is stable just when it is coexpressed with PPV HCPro. CP levels sharply declined when native N. benthamiana extracts expressing LONG and P1b, the RSS of Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) were incuba native protein extracts deriving from plants infected with either wild-type PPV or the PPV chimera expresses CVYV P1b instead of HCPro were obtained. the instability of CP in the absence of HCPro was specific in all cases, as the green fluorescent protein produced from the same construct remained stable after the indicated incubation period. extracts prepared in phosphate buffer (SDS) and time, in minutes, elapsed after extraction. asterisk indicates membrane was overexposed. PPV CP was transiently produced as a GFP-CP fusion. the disappearance of CP from soluble protein fractions can be explained by either specific degradation or aggregation followed by precipitation. CP degradation bands appeared after ex vivo incubation only in protein samples where CP disappears. the presence of this viral factor in pellets (cell debris) was analyzed by Western blotting. the CP expressed from HCPro behaves as expected for the wild-type virus. the major part of CP behaves as expected for the wild-type virus. these virus-like particles were absent from fractions 1 to 3 (Fig. 2E) CP was expressed from all of these plasmids, as well as from pLONG as a positive control, by agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana leaves together with plasmids expressing the proteinase NIaPro. CP was expressed from all of these plasmids, as well as from pLONG as a positive control. the CP produced from NIb-GFP-CP was easily separated from GFP by the action of the NIaPro proteinase supplied in trans. the absence of P3 and 6K1 from the viral polyprotein is enough to promote PPV CP instability, even in presence of HCPro. 6K1-GFP-mediated cleavage occurs mainly in cis. resulting viral sequence(s) required to provide stability to CP in presence of HCPro. deletion in both the N terminus and entire P3 amino acid sequences also disrupts PPV CP. mutations abolished viral spread from inoculated to neighbor cells. accumulation of PPV CP was similar in all cases independently of the LONG version. CP produced from LONG was as stable as the one expressed from wild-type LONG. pictures of leaves agroinfiltrated first with pP1HCPro or pP1b and 1 h later with the indicated version of pLONG plus pRFP. plot uses average PPV values at 7 days after infiltration equal to 100%. samples at each time point correspond to a pool of 2 independent plants expressing the indicated viral construct. id pLONG(P3) was constructed by recoding the first 153 amino acids of PPV P3 with synonymous mutations. CP was transiently expressed along PPV P1HCPro or CVYV P1b. stability of CP was assessed by immunoblot detection. extracts prepared in phosphate buffer and time, in minutes, elapsed after extraction with phosphate buffer. asterisk indicates membrane was overexposed. instability of PPV CP produced in the absence of the N-terminal region of P3 is associated with a defect in the assembly of virion-like particles. centrifugation was carried out immediately after tissue homogenization. CP produced from LONG(P3) is able to form virion-like particles. PPV CP produced in the presence of a truncated P3 is unable to be assembled in structures similar to viral particles. small leaf fragments were excised and examined with a confocal microscope. a similar result was obtained when pLONG was delivered in leaf already expressing the heterologous RSS P1b. this last result indicates that the RNA silencing suppression activity of HCPro is needed for the movement of pLONG. a subviral RNA species of PPV that includes the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs is able to replicate and spread from cell to cell in the presence of an RSS. we took advantage of the system based on two consecutive agroinfiltrations (Fig. 6A) to test the ability of pLONG(PIPO) to spread locally. the lack of the P3 N terminus prevents replication and supports the hypothesis that this defect impedes the assembly of CP in stable particles. we studied the CP produced from LONG(CIKS) which carries an intact P3 but lacks RNA replication ability. extracts of N. benthamiana were loaded on the gradient immediately after protein extraction and after 60 min of incubation at 25\u00b0C. asterisk indicates that the membrane was overexposed. total CP accumulation from NIbGDD was similar to that of the wild-type PPV. CP was degraded when native extracts were incubated for 30 min at 25\u00b0C. PPV CP produced by a nonreplicating RNA is assembled in stable particles. a wild-type CP was expressed from a nonreplicating RNA together with a replication-competent RNA that expresses a CP mutant unable to self-interact and form viral particles. to unravel this issue, we designed an experiment in which a wild-type CP was expressed from a nonreplicating RNA together with a replication-competent RNA. CP accumulation was assessed by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal serum specific for PPV CP and a monoclonal antibody specific for GFP. extracts were loaded on the gradient immediately after being prepared (0\u2032) or after 60 min of incubation at 25\u00b0C (60\u2032). asterisk indicates that the membrane was overexposed. extracts of N. benthamiana leaves were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation immediately after extraction and after 60 min of incubation at 25\u00b0C. CP from GFP-CP and LONG(CPD) stably assembled in structures that migrated in internal fractions of the gradient equivalent to that of virion-like particles produced by LONG(CPD) PPV subviral species LONG produces a truncated polyprotein starting at the N terminus of P3. expression of CP and HCPro alone fails to produce stable CP and virion-like particles. this led us to conclude that the LONG species contributes viral factors that collaborate with CP and HCPro in PPV virion assembly. PPV 5\u2032 NCR preserves replication ability (44) unlike other viruses of the Picorna-like supergroup (45, 46), RNA motifs required for RNA replication are very scarce at the 5\u2032 NCR of the potyviral genome. a large cis-acting element that even includes coding sequences of the CP cistron is required for RNA replication (47, 48) PPV CP might coat cellular RNAs in the absence of viral replication. but the absence of CP-containing stable particles from nonreplicating RNAs argues against this possibility. the link between virion assembly and RNA replication is much stronger in PPV than in case of BMV. CP synthesized from viral RNAs in replication vesicles forms virus-like particles. the CP produced by RNAs transported from the nucleus does not form stable virions. current data do not allow discrimination of whether the RNA produced by the cellular RNA polymerase has a peculiarity. premature encapsidation can interfere with crucial roles of the viral RNA, namely, translation and replication. unspecific RNA coating wastes viral resources. it was proposed that CP plays a relevant role in this coordination. pPPV (named pBIN-ICPPVNKGFP-NOSt in reference 73), pLONG (named pLONG-GFP in reference 20), pPPV-P1b (named P1P1b in reference 27), pP1HCPro (named pMDC32-P1HCPro in reference 20), and pNIaPro (pMDC32-NIaPro in reference 28) pLONG(CI the accuracy of each construct was verified by restriction analysis as well as by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Spain) the accuracy of each construct was verified by restriction analysis as well as by restriction enzymes used to finally build each plasmid. 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (2 ml/mg), was used as homogenization buffer. samples were centrifuged to separate cell debris. supernatants were resolved on SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) gradients were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 20 min at 237,020 g in an SW55 rotor in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge. aliquots of the fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. total RNA extraction from agroinfiltrated patches, cDNA synthesis using a tagged strand-specific primer, and quantitative PCR were carried out by following a previously described method. plants were cultured in a greenhouse at 18 to 23\u00b0C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with supplementary illumination. plasmid pP3-6K1 uses pMDC32 (74) as a backbone and carries the P3-6K1 pLONG(P3), pLONG(P3), pLONG(P3-6K1), pLONG(P3-CI), pNIb-GFP-CP, and pGFP-CP were constructed by an overlapping PCR approach followed by digestion/ligation. the same strategy was followed to build pLONG(P3), but in this particular case a synthetic DNA fragment (GeneArt, Invitrogen) was used as one of the PCR samples of leaf patches infiltrated with agrobacterium were incubated at room temperature for 3 h to be further infiltrated in the intercellular spaces of 2 leaves of N. benthamiana plants. the powder was thawed and homogenized in denaturation/loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 6 M urea, 4% glycerol, 5%-mercaptoethanol) a mix of anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science) as primary detection reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare Life Science) as secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection with a LifeABlot kit. images were acquired with an Olympus DP70 digital camera coupled to the microscope. the confocal microscope was controlled by the program LAS AF v2.7.3. excitation and emission conditions were used to detect GFP and RFP fluorescence."}
