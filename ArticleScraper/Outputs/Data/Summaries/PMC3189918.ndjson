{"summary": "exosomes fuse to the recipient cell membrane or are engulfed by phagocytic cells. exosomes can induce strong epitope-specific immune responses. chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell origin (B-CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the western hemisphere. a prototypic disease undergoing immune evasion as the malignant cells lack important accessory and co-stimulatory molecules. activated T cells from patients show a significantly reduced expression of CD40 ligand (CD154) or are completely CD154-negative. this interaction is essential for CD40 signaling and subsequent induction of other immune accessory molecules like CD80 and CD86. gp350+ exosomes can co-transfer functional CD154 as immune accessory molecule to B-CLL cells. they are stimulated to express surface molecules like CD54, CD80, CD86 and CD95. gp350 confers B-cell tropism, and reactivates specific T cells. gradient revealed co-sedimentation of gp350 with exosome markers hps70, tsg101 and CD63. gp350 is presumably located within the exosome membrane because it could be targeted with a specific antibody. gp350 is incorporated into 293 exosomes and confers B cell tropism. gp350 confers B-cell tropism to exosomes. PBMCs from a healthy donor were incubated for 18 h with gp350+/gfp+ exosomes. only CD19+ B-cells stained positive, whereas an interaction of gp350+ exosomes with CD3+ T cells and CD19\u2013 cells could not be observed. exosomes incubated with BNRF1+/gp350+ exosomes with gp350. p350+ exosomes transfer functional CD154 to B cells. gp350+ exosomes can activate specific CD4+ T lymphocytes. p350+/CD154+ exosomes specifically bound to CD19+ B cells from a B-CLL patient. 293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding CD154. gp350 enhances the transfer of CD154 to B-CLL cells. transfer of functional CD154 renders B-CLL cells significantly immunogenic. hek293 cells were transfected with a CD154 expression plasmid. exosomes that carry both proteins efficiently conveyed CD154 surface expression to B-CLL cells. gp350 is a neo-antigen in B-CLL cells and activates specific CD4+ cytolytic T lymphocytes. PBMCs from healthy donors, which were incubated with gp350+ exosomes, efficiently re-stimulated an autologous gp350-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. this is a very interesting aspect because B-CLL patients usually maintain a robust and easily recruited CMV- PBMCs from a patient diagnosed with B-CLL were stimulated three times with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes. we then incubated autologous PBMCs for 24 hours with either CD154+/gp350+ exosomes, CD154+/gp350\u2013 exosomes or unmodified 293 exosomes. the next day, these cells were labeled with calcein and used as targets for autologous effector T PBMCs loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes were better targets than PBMCs loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes. the fact that the LCL was efficiently lysed by stimulated PBMCs whereas the B-blasts were not further indicates the reactivation of gp350-specific T-cells. one out of three independent experiments are shown. stimulation with gp350+/gp350+ exosomes yielded 1107 vital cells. stimulation with gp350+ exosomes reactivates autologous T-cells from patients with B-CLL. stimulation with gp350+/gp350+ exosomes is a powe rful option. the stimulation of PBMCs with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes led to a 23-fold and 15-fold increase in numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (B) no vital cells were detectable after 31 days when PBMCs were stimulated with exosomes from parental 293 cells (293) or when cells were left untreated (w/o) gp350 is packaged into exosomes, confers B-cell tropism. exosomes can transport ectopically expressed proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is presumably present as a cargo in the exosomal lumen. three days later, we isolated vesicles from the supernatants of transfected HEK293 cells. gp350 was detected in vesicles that floated at a density between 1.03 and 1.08. the gradient also revealed the co-sedimentation of gp350 with the exosome markers hps70, tsg101 and CD63. gp350 is presumably located within the exosome membrane because it could be targeted with a specific antibody. gp350 confers B-cell tropism to exosomes. PBMCs from a healthy donor were incubated for 18 h with gp350+/gfp+ exosomes. autologous BNRF1-specific CD4+ T cells were added. oblastoid cells engulf exosomes, process their proteins in lysosomes and present epitops in association with MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells. we then incubated purified CD19+ B cells with these exosomes overnight and used these PBMC as stimulators for an autologous BNRF1-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. this result demonstrates the potential of gp350+ exosome blot with a CD154-specific antibody demonstrated the presence of CD154 in exosome preparations. an OptiPrepTM gradient revealed co-sedimentation with gp350. gp350+/CD154+ exosomes specifically bound to CD19+ B cells from a B-CLL patient. 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for CD154 and/or gp350. fresh B-CLL cells were co-cultivated with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes. transfer of CD154 was measured by flow cytometry. DR13+ donor either with 293 exosomes, with exosomes from 293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for gp350 (gp350+ exo) or with expression plasmids for gp350 and CD154 (CD154+/gp350+ exo) one day later, we added HLA-DR13-restricted gp350-specific CD4+ T cells and measured their activation with an IFN- EL gp350 serves as a viral neo-antigen in exosome-treated leukemic cells. we incubated autologous PBMCs for 24 hours with either CD154+/gp350+ exosomes, CD154+/gp350+ exosomes or unmodified 293 exosomes. PBMCs incubated with exosomes from non-transfected 293 cells were lysed to almost same extent as non s from a patient diagnosed with B-CLL were stimulated three times with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes. then used as effector cells towards autologous calcein-labeled PBMCs loaded with exosomes indicated or not loaded with exosomes. PBMCs loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes were constantly better targets than PBMCs loaded with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes. B-CLL cells treated with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes are potent stimulators of autologous T cells. we then wanted to assess whether these B-CLL cells became immunogenic to autologous EBV- and CLL-specific T cells. we stimulated 1,5107 PBMCs from patients with B-CLL three times within 21 days. peripheral blood from a patient with only 4% T-cell among his leukocytes at day 0 were stimulated three times with different exosomes within a period of 31 days. the stimulation of PBMCs with CD154+/gp350+ exosomes led to a 23-fold and 15-fold increase in number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. exosomes are cellular microvesicles, which have already demonstrated their potential to induce specific immune responses. exosomes are cellular microvesicles, which have already demonstrated their potential to induce specific immune responses. transfecting HEK293 cells with expression plasmids coding for CD154 and gp350 resulted in the secretion of modified exosomes carrying both proteins. an undetermined fraction of exosomes is presumably engulfed and degraded in lysosomes in such way that peptides of exosomal proteins are presented in association with MHC class II molecules. gp350 molecules on the surface of exosomes probably target gp350 and other EBV proteins have potential as promising neo-antigens in B-CLL cells exploiting and redirecting the strong anti-viral cellular immune responses to leukemic cells. gp350 is the major envelope protein of EBV and confers viral B-cell tropism by interacting with the complement receptor 2 (CD21), which is highly expressed on B lymphocytes. the generation of modified exosomes is not limited to 293 cells. gp350-carrying exosomes can be regarded as powerful and promising tools for various immunotherapeutic approaches. pelleted particles were washed, resuspended in 500 l volume PBS. exosomes were further purified by flotation into a 5-30% iodixanol gradient (OptiPrepTM, Sigma Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) d secondary antibodies were obtained from becton Dickinson or Immunotools (Friesoyte, Germany) 3107 cells were cultivated with 100 g of exosomes in a final volume of 5 ml. re-stimulations were performed by adding 1107 autologous PBMCs. the cytotoxicity assays were performed over a time period of 6 h. the calcein released into the supernatant was quantified with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 530 nm. all experiments were performed at least three times. pelleted particles were washed, resuspended in 500 l volume PBS. the protein content was analyzed in a lowry microassay. exosomes were further purified by flotation into a 5-30% iodixanol gradient. 3107 cells were cultivated with 100 g of exosomes in a final volume of 5 ml. re-stimulations were performed by adding 1107 lethally irradiated autologous PBMCs that have been loaded with 100 g exosomes for 5h. natant quantified with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 530 nm respectively. all experiments were performed at least three times."}
