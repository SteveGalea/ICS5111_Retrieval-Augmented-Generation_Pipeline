{"summary": "from 1994 to 2005, the world witnessed over 67,000 deaths and 260 million people wounded each year due to disasters. the frequency of disasters and MCIs is increasing, and calamities always involve mass casualties because they are unpredictable. disasters and MCIs consume local resources in the short and long term. the aim of this study was to calculate the incidence, mortality and overall rates of disasters and MCIs. a single-tiered fire-based EMS handles disasters and MCIs occurring throughout the entire region and includes 16 regional headquarters of the fire department with a total of 1,400 advanced ambulances and 5,400 EMS providers. population-based cross-sectional study based on NEMA data from 2000 to 2009. a disaster has been defined as a case in which more than 10 deaths are reported, more than 100 people are affected, a national emergency has been declared, or international assistance has been requested. the study used data from the NEMA administrative database to analyze major disaster and MCI types in Korea. the data was used to present other social statistics, such as population and size of Korea. people who were killed or injured in Korean disasters or MCIs who were registered in the NEMA administrative database for the period from 2000 to 2009 were selected as study subjects. the primary outcome was analyzed using a descriptive analysis to calculate the incidence trends of disasters/MCIs. the secondary outcome was the assessment of the incidence trends of disasters/MCIs by time-series and by type. the number of deaths and casualties by disaster/MCI type, the number of deaths and crude death rates by province and the number of injuries and crude injury incidence rates by province. study objectives aimed to calculate incidence, mortality and overall rates of disasters and MCIs. study was population-based cross-sectional study based on NEMA data from 2000 to 2009. CDC in the united states has defined an MCI as a case in which more than 6 casualties have occurred. an MCI has been defined as an incident that involves more than 6 casualties, regardless of the affected area or number of deaths. the study employed data for 2000 to 2009 taken from the NEMA administrative database to analyze the major disaster and MCI types in Korea. data was collected from 16 regional fire department headquarters within the NEMA from January 2000 to December 2009. the extracted variables were the dates of the disaster, the address, the disaster type, the number of casualties, the estimated financial loss, the mobilized manpower, the location of the fire, the type of collision (if the event was a car crash), and the number of mobilized ambulances. the Gyeonggi province showed the highest frequency of disasters (27 cases, 23.5%) and MCIs (606 cases, 19.7%), followed by Seoul with 17 cases (14.8%) of disasters and 343 cases of MCIs (11.1%) and Gyeongnam with 5 cases (4.4%) of disasters and 269 cases of MCIs (8.7%) floods with 47 cases (20.2%) and tropical cyclones with 24 cases (10.3%) the number and frequency of injuries and deaths were on the same order. road crashes were the most common type (2,369 persons, 48.3%), followed by mass gatherings (1,499 persons, 24.9%), fires (991 persons, 16.5%), air crashes (127 persons, 17.7%), explosions (41 persons, 5.7%), water crashes (37 persons, 5.2%). 69.7%), followed by fire (211 persons, 13.7%), water crashes (75 persons, 4.9%), and collapse (55 persons, 3.6%), etc. crude mortality rates for disasters and MCIs nationwide were 2.36 per 100,000 people and 6.78 per 100,000 people. previous research carried out in the us, Britain, and Spain dealt only with natural disasters, MCIs, and major incidents (7, 27, 28) most disasters showed a mixed pattern. flood was the most common (31.5%), followed by air crashes (30.2%). the leading causes for disasters in Korea were road crashes, general floods, incidents at mass gatherings, and fires. there is no efficient connection and cooperation with the public health sector. a disaster management plan for public health is warranted to properly analyze and present the characteristics of disasters/MCIs. 115 disasters and 3,079 MCIs occurred from January 2000 to December 2009. technical disasters/MCIs occurred more frequently than natural disasters/MCIs. crude death rates per 100,000 people for disasters and MCIs were 2.36 and 6.78. Incident report criteria of NEMA* (Article 3 in fire basic act no.11690) NEMA* directive for fire investigation and incident report (No.229) Immediate incident report criteria of some provinces."}
