{"summary": "viral respiratory tract infections are a common cause of hospitalization and mortality in infants and young children. there is a need for a rapid and sensitive differential diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens to prevent nosocomial infections and to minimize unnecessary antibiotic usage [4\u20136]. influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus (FluB), seasonal influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 (sH1N1), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), human rhinovirus (HRV), coronavirus subtypes 229E (CoV 229E), and adenovirus (Adv) another tube is used for the simultaneous detection of seven respiratory viruses including parainfluenza virus type 2 (PIV2), parainfluenza 149 participants were male and 98 (39.68%) female. the specimens were collected within 5 to 7 days after symptoms onset. children's parents were informed of the study's purpose.
