{"summary": "noroviruses are responsible for half of all cases of gastroenteritis worldwide. their low infectious dose, ability to persist in an infectious state in the environment, and resistance to many commonly used cleaning agents have led to many disease outbreaks that have proved very difficult to contain. the mechanism of action has also been shown to be complex and variable. we have previously shown with a small range of copper alloys the rapid destruction of murine norovirus (MNV) this study observed that the rate of inactivation was affected by temperature and aqueous content and did not involve generation of reactive oxygen species. the virus band was aspirated and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the virus was then concentrated by pelleting it through a sucrose cushion at 90,000 g for 2.5 h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter L7 65 ultracentrifuge. the virus was then resuspended by gentle pipetting and stored at 80\u00b0C until required. a new study has investigated simulated-wet-fomite surface contamination only. the virus was removed from the coupons at various times and assayed for infectivity in RAW 264.7 cells as described previously. amplification of a viral gene important in early stages of infection was performed on untreated and RNase-treated samples. exposure to copper surfaces has been shown to result in massive degradation of the genome. the virus was resuspended by gentle pipetting and stored at 80\u00b0C until required. metal coupons with a surface area of 1 cm2 and a thickness of 0.5 mm were degreased in acetone. metal coupons with a surface area of 1 cm2 and a thickness of 0.5 mm were degreased in acetone. the virus was removed from the coupons at various times and assayed for infectivity in simulated-wet-fomite contamination. the method resulted in a recovery rate of >95% of the inoculum. exposure to copper surfaces has been shown to result in massive degradation of the genome, suggesting that the results may apply with any viral gene (20). Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as means standard errors of the means (SEM) and are from multiple independent experiments. ovirus was present on all surfaces except stainless steel and silicon rubber at 20 days. no significant reduction in infectivity of norovirus occurs on any surface over 2 h at room temperature. a layer of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was as effective at killing Enterococcus hirae as pure copper but found that copper II oxide, CuO, is inhibitory by forming a protective layer that reduces the rate of corrosion (passivation layer) we observed that if the surfaces of alloys C70600 and C72500 were abraded by rubbing with coarse sandpaper (Fig. 3A), the efficacy of the former to inactivate MNV-1 was Approximately 5 105 PFU of infectious virus was applied to 1-cm2 samples of abraded and unabraded metal coupons and incubated at room temperature. at various time points, virus was removed from the surfaces and assessed for infectious virus particles. zinc ionophores, such as pyrithione, have been used as therapies for cold and influenza. zinc ionophores, such as pyrithione, have been investigated. Approximately 5 105 PFU of infectious virus was applied to 1-cm2 samples of test surfaces and incubated at room temperature. at various time points, virus was removed from the surfaces and assessed for infectious virus by plaque assay. the efficacy of these brasses in inactivating norovirus is directly proportional to the copper content. morphology may be affected by absence of cell debris and PBS diluent. uneven surface suggests some damage has occurred to the outer capsid. a diameter slightly larger than 40 nm has been reported for individual virions. if virus is removed immediately from copper surfaces, copy number is reduced in the RNase-treated sample. this suggests that capsid damage has already occurred in the time it takes to process the sample. if the virus is allowed to dry rapidly, infectivity is reduced much faster because the rapid drying process affects virus infectivity. the nature of norovirus makes it very difficult to stop the spread of infection from an outbreak. there is a need for more-effective and safe disinfectants for decontaminating large areas of norovirus contamination. copper alloy surfaces may exhibit antiviral activity against other important RNA viruses for which transmission via touch surfaces is important. copper alloy surfaces may exhibit antiviral activity against other important RNA viruses for which transmission via touch surfaces is important. no significant reduction in infectivity of norovirus occurs on any surface over 2 h. this was followed by a steady decline in the infectivity of norovirus. a layer of cuprous oxide may contribute to efficacy. copper II oxide, CuO, is inhibitory by forming a protective layer that reduces the rate of corrosion (passivation layer) if surfaces of alloys C70600 and C72500 were abraded by rubbing with coarse sandpaper, the efficacy of the former to inactivate MNV-1 was reduced following 30 min of contact at room temperature. MNV was rapidly inactivated on copper and C70600. the extent of inactivation on copper alloys was proportional to the percentage of copper. alloy C72500 is not as effective as alloys with lower percentages of copper. nickel was first reported to inhibit replication of rhinoviruses in 1974. zinc salts and lozenges have been used as therapies for cold and influenza. zinc ionophores, such as pyrithione, have been investigated. 105 PFU of infectious virus was applied to 1-cm2 samples of test surfaces. the efficacy of these brasses in inactivating norovirus is directly proportional to the copper content. 100% Zn appeared to have some antiviral activity, similar to that of Muntz metal (C28000) the uneven surface suggests that some damage has occurred to the outer capsid, resulting in a diameter slightly larger than 40 nm being reported for individual virions. this demonstrates the protective nature of the capsid and its role in MNV persistence. the genome is still able to replicate. damage to capsid has already occurred in the time that it takes to process the sample. after 2 h of contact, the overall copy number was reduced on copper. but the reduced amplification of the VPg gene on both surfaces suggests capsid damage occurred on copper and stainless steel. Morter et al. detected norovirus using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in 31% of more than 30 surfaces tested in a hospital environment over a 4-month period, with 100% contamination on soap and alcohol dispensers, chairs, carpets, and Zimmer frames. contaminated surfaces are responsible for a secondary outbreak that occurs primarily because of inadequate disinfection of vomitus and fecal norovirus contamination. copper alloy surfaces may exhibit antiviral activity against other important RNA viruses. transmission via touch surfaces is important, including coronavirus (unpublished data) and Ebola virus."}
