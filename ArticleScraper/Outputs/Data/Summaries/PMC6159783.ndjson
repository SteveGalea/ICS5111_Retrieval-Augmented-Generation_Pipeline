{"summary": "single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Aurora kinase A (AURKA) or Aurora kinase B (AURKB) are associated with the risk and survival of several cancers. until now, there is no research about these polymorphisms in TNBC patients. polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB gene might predict favorable DFS in pre-menopausal, grade 3 and lymph node-positive patients. breast cancer is the most common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer death in women around the world. chromosomes in prophase, the centromere in prometaphase and metaphase, the central spindle in anaphase, and the mid-body in cytokinesis. AURKB plays a key role during mitosis by regulating chromosomal alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis. immunohistochemistry performed with anti-ER and anti-PR antibodies was used to evaluate the ER and PR status. positive ER and PR status was defined by nuclear staining of more than 1% according to the guidelines issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAPs) in 2010. Genomic DNA was isolated by the routine phenol\u2013chloroform method. each DNA sample was diluted to a working concentration of 10 ng/mL for genotyping. multivariate analysis was adjusted for age (50 vs >50), histological grade (1\u20132 vs 3 vs unknown [UK]), tumor size (2 cm vs >2 cm), lymph node status (with vs without regional lymph node metastasis) and vascular invasion (with vs without vascular invasion) ER and PR status was defined by nuclear staining of more than 1% according to the guidelines issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAPs) in 2010.16. Tumors negative for ER, PR, and HER2 were defined as TNBCs. intron variant C/G AURKA 0.167 rs8173 20:56369735 utr variant 3 prime C/G AURKA 0.395 rs7503353 17:8204661 Downstream variant 500B G/T AURKB 0.163 rs11651993 17:8212456 Upstream variant 2 KB C/T AURKB 0.105 rs11869914 17:8211831 Upstream variant 2 KB G/T AUR the multivariate analysis was adjusted for age (50 vs >50), histological grade (1\u20132 vs 3 vs unknown [UK]), tumor size (2 cm vs >2 cm), lymph node status (with vs without regional lymph node metastasis) and vascular invasion (with vs without regional lymph node metastasis) tumor size (P = 0.024, HR = 3.149, 95% CI = 1.166\u20138.509) and lymph node status (P 0.001, HR = 11.058, 95% CI = 3.287\u201337.206) were significantly related to both DFS and OS. polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB gene and survival of TNBC patients are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. in univariate analysis, AURKA rs10485805 GA genotype carriers had significantly worse OS than GG genotype carriers. but after multivariate analysis, there was no association between rs10485805 genotype and OS. two polymorphisms in AURKB were significantly associated with DFS in both univariate and multivariate analyses.
