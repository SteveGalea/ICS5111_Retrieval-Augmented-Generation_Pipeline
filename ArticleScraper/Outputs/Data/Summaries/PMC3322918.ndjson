{"summary": "the study The SARS outbreak in Vietnam began with the admission of a traveler from Hong Kong on February 26, 2003, to hospital A, a 56-bed, three-story, privately owned and expatriate-operated facility located in Hanoi. hospital B treated 33 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS between March 12 and May 2, 2003, the discharge date of the last patient. ns Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2013Belgium, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. system was established to restrict visitors, and entry guards and advisors were tasked with distributing and monitoring personal protective equipment. participants provided written consent and answered questions about demographics, level of contact with case-patients, and personal protective equipment use. .1% and 64.5% reported being in SARS patient rooms during medication nebulizer treatment. 65% reported being in patient rooms during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. all 62 ward workers reported using an N-95 mask after March 19. only 56 (90.3%) reported \u201calways\u201d or \u201cusually\u201d using a mask. one SARS ward respondent reported a fever, and less than 23% reported either a cough or sore throat. over 35 healthcare workers reported being exposed to a SARS patient during events that can potentially generate aerosols. but they did not acquire SARS. in hospital B, extensive transmission clusters followed admission of the index case-patient. the more severely ill SARS patients of hospital A likely required more intensive nursing care, perhaps increasing the duration and dose of SARS-CoV exposure. the findings raises the question of whether family caregivers or visitors might have become infected with SARS-CoV. the median days to admission was 7 (range 1\u201313) after illness onset. we found no evidence of SARS-CoV transmission among hospital B workers. this finding may be explained by differences in infection control practices."}
