{"summary": "hydrochloride salt of synthetic RTD-1 (>98%) was prepared as described previously (30), dissolved in endotoxin-free diluent (0.9% NaCl) at 4 mg/ml, and stored at 4\u00b0C. animals were housed under controlled temperature (22 2\u00b0C) and lighting (12-h light, 6 AM\u20136 PM; 12-h dark, 6 PM\u20136 AM) with free access to water and food. blood samples were obtained using the tail artery catheter for basal plasma levels of glucose, insulin, TG, and cytokines/chemokines. a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was conducted by infusing human insulin (5 mUkg1min1 Novolin; Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ) to raise plasma insulin in physiological ranges (16, 17) plasma cytokines were analyzed using a Ponte Scientific TG reagent. liver and muscle TG were analyzed using a Rat Cytokine/Chemokine Multiplex kit. homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was estimated.

HOMA-IR. increase in HOMA-IR was markedly reversed by RTD-1 treatment. only 10 of 27 cytokines detected by the Rat Cytokine/Chemokine Multiplex Kit from Millipore were measured reliably. plasma levels of leptin, IL-4, VEGF, and CCL11 (eotaxin) were significantly increased by high-fat feeding; RTD-1 treatment did not reverse these changes.

RTD-1 treatment showed a tendency to decrease calorie intake during high-fat feeding, but this effect did not gain statistical significance. high-fat feeding showed a tendency to increase basal plasma FFA levels. this increase was completely prevented by RTD-1 treatment. plasma glucose (A), FFA (B), TG (C) and insulin (D) levels were significantly raised by high-fat feeding. glucose infusion rates (GINF) required during the clamp represent insulin's action to inhibit hepatic glucose output and increase peripheral glucose uptake. GINF was substantially lower in the HFD group than in the LFD group (Fig. 5, C and D) IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- expression levels were too low to be accurately quantified. IL-6 expression levels were too low to be accurately quantified. data are means SE for 7 or 8 rats. IL-1 and TNF expression in adipose (A) and liver (B) tissues determined by qRT-PCR. RTD-1 treatment showed a tendency to decrease calorie intake during high-fat feeding. but this effect did not gain statistical significance. changes in body weight (A and B) and calorie intake (C and D) during feeding and drug treatments. data are means SE for 7 or 8 rats. HOMA-IR. increase in HOMA-IR was markedly reversed by RTD-1 treatment (P = 0.04). of 27 cytokines that can be detected by the Rat Cytokine/Chemokine Multiplex Kit from Millipore, only 10 were measured reliably (i.e., SE 20% in all groups; Table 1). IL-6 expression levels were too low to be accurately quantified. IL-1 and TNF- expression in adipose (A) and liver (B) tissues determined by qRT-PCR. data are means SE for 7 or 8 rats. study demonstrates that RTD-1 improves insulin action and normalizes plasma glucose and FFA levels in DIO rats. effects occurred without altering body weight, food intake, or fat accumulation in the liver. insulin resistance with thiazolidinedione drugs can arrest -cell decline (4, 36) the strongest predictor of prevention of diabetes with thiazolidinediones was an initial reduction in insulin levels (4, 36), reflecting reduced secretory demands on -cells. the effects of RTD-1 to decrease hepatic expression of gluconeogenic genes were associated with no effect on fatty liver. these data are consistent with previous suggestions that there is a strong dissociation between fatty liver and hepatic glucose production or insulin resistance. -defensins suppressed proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine release in vitro in peripheral blood leukocytes and cultured THP-1 monocytes stimulated by various TLR agonists. -defensins suppressed rises of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo in mice challenged with bacterial infection. however, RTD-1 treatment did not alter cytokine/chemokine levels in uninfected animals. this is supported by the finding that RTD-1 had no significant effects on plasma cytokine levels or IL-1 and TNF- expression in liver and adipose tissue. future studies are warranted to address this important issue."}
