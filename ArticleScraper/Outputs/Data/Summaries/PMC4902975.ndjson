{"summary": "shortitudinal samples from two production sites were used to describe the pattern of PEDV shedding (rRT-PCR) in individual rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and pen oral fluids (OF) pig serum and pig serum samples were negative for both PEDV antibody and nucleic acid. oral fluid IgA response increased through 96 DPE and began to decline at the last sampling on 111 DPE. results showed oral fluid-based testing could provide an easy and \u201canimal-friendly\u201d approach to sample collection."}
