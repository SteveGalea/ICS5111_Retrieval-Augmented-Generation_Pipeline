{"summary": "regulatory deficits could stymie time-sensitive efforts to contain public health threats when no efficacious curative, therapeutic, or preventive interventions exist to counter the threat in question. a global-level rapid-response governance framework for the employment of unapproved interventions in humanitarian contexts should be established as a matter of urgency. AVAREF in pretoria, south africa, has established a collaborative mechanism for fast tracking approvals for clinical trials and registration of Ebola-related products in affected countries. some of these regulatory mechanisms are now being postulated and utilised to facilitate time-sensitive access to investigational interventions in Ebola-affected countries. the mechanism exempts the use of an experimental intervention from prior IRB review and approval. it allows for one emergency use of an experimental intervention at an institution. any subsequent use of the investigational drug at the institution is subject to prospective IRB review and approval. order issued for emergency use of anthrax vaccine for the treatment and prophylaxis of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [14]. in 2005, an emergency use authorization was issued for the emergency use of an unapproved anthrax vaccine for the prevention of inhalation anthrax [15], because it was believed that US military forces faced a heightened risk of attack with anthrax. such authorizations could be deemed ethically permissible on utilitarian and public health ethics grounds. the US FDA has attempted to clarify the legitimacy of this practice by explicitly condoning the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses in prescribed circumstances. some scientists have postulated using drugs that have already been approved for the treatment of other diseases for the treatment of Ebola. this proposal has yet to win WHO endorsement, but illustrates the value of having a regulatory regime that permits off-label clinical use outside of an EUA directive. the drug was approved for testing in a Phase I clinical trial in 2011. the trial was then put on hold in early July 2014 to investigate the mechanism behind elevated cytokines in healthy human volunteers receiving the drug. the change of status of the drug trial to \u201cpartial hold\u201d opened up the possibility for administration to patients of single ascending doses of the drug. agent BCX4430 has demonstrated post-exposure efficacy against Ebola virus and marburg virus disease in rodent models [32] and will soon be the subject of a dose ranging efficacy study in nonhuman primates [33] the use of such a mechanism is invaluable in time-sensitive emergencies such as Ebola outbreaks and was likely the regulatory mechanism utilised to provide the investigational drug Z-Mapp. the emergency use IND mechanism can generally be used in an emergency situation for an individual patient. however, the mechanism is ill-suited for use in mass public health administration. the US has established a regulatory mechanism that permits the FDA to approve the emergency use of drugs, devices, and medical products (including diagnostics) despite the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses being a common practice in most settings, it is a practice that is not formally regulated, nor formally condoned, in many settings. the US FDA has attempted to clarify the legitimacy of this practice by explicitly condoning the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses in prescribed circumstances. a regulatory regime permits off-label clinical use outside of an EUA directive. such an approach may allow for the use of the anti-influenza drug Favipiravir (T-705) as an emergency off-label anti-Ebola agent [22], as is currently the case in france [23], notwithstanding its planned testing as an anti-ebola agent. in such instances, the FDA has the discretion to partially lift a trial\u2019s previously declared \u201chold\u201d in prescribed the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product for which safety has been established based on adequate and well-controlled animal studies. this mechanism allows the FDA to approve drugs based on efficacy testing in animals and only safety testing in healthy humans. this mechanism is particularly valuable in the context of public health emergencies. establishment of a governance system on access to unregistered investigational interventions at international, regional, and national levels is crucial to managing public health emergencies of international concern. such a system will be impotent in the absence of competent local regulatory capacity, relevant health system infrastructure, and adequately trained and occupationally protected researchers and health workers at the grassroots level. the solicitation of informed consent in relation to unproven interventions should be given particular attention. investigators should give thought to managing instances when eligible patients lack the ability to provide informed consent autonomously. time-sensitive access to unapproved experimental interventions should be permitted conditionally, on humanitarian grounds."}
