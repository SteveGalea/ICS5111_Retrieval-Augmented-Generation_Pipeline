{"summary": "upToDate is a professional database used by healthcare practitioners for point-of-care decisions. the information provided is rigorously authored and edited by experienced physicians. research suggests that information provided through the site helps improve healthcare outcomes in hospitals. model selection was performed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique [20] at every single week incorporating new CDC ILI information as it became available. our approach recalibrated weekly the relevance of the search activity for each individual term according to its historical prediction ability. in collaboration with upToDate, we obtained search volume of 23 search terms related to ILI. the search terms were influenza, haemophilus influenzae, flu, parainfluenza, H1N1, H7N9, H5N1, H3N2, grippe, grippe, gripe, adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, Bordetella pertussis, pneumonia, bronchitis, H9 model selection was performed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique [20] at every single week incorporating new CDC ILI information as it became available. our approach recalibrated weekly the relevance of the search activity for each individual term according to its historical prediction ability. we produced real-time estimates of ILI activity at time t. CDC ILI is shown in black; our model, named UpToDate, is shown in light grey; and Google Flu Trends (GFT) estimates are shown with a dashed grey line for context. a slight overestimation of the influenza epidemic curve in the second week of January 2013. Tamiflu search activity among clinicians is highly correlated with cdc-reported influenza-like illness. the model presented here has numerous strengths compared to GFT. the success of our approach suggests that low volumes of queries in relevant subject-matter experts' databases provide promising way to identify meaningful signals to track influenza activity. upToDate data is not publicly available and therefore not ready to be used as an alternative disease detection sentinel. the data streams lack the specificity observed in traditional surveillance systems."}
