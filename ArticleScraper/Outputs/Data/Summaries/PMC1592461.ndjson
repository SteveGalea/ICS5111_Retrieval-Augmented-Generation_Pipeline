{"summary": "several techniques exist to examine protein-protein interactions. yeast two-hybrid systems involve fusing proteins to either the DNA binding or transcriptional activation domains of the Gal4 transcription factor. if binding occurs in yeast, a reporter gene is expressed. hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects more than 350 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (6). these DNA viruses replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate in which DNA synthesis is primed by P itself. this feature can be exploited in a priming assay, which measures covalent attachment of radiolabeled dGMP to P. aa 177-183 5 Test mutants in functional assays Assessed mutants in DNA priming and partial proteolysis 6 Compete interaction with peptides containing putative binding site Dose dependent decrease in priming. in vitro translation of P was performed using the T7 or T3 Megascript kits. the overall sequence identity between these viruses is 26%. we aligned the sequences using Clustal W. Motifs of 4-10 amino acids with >80% homology. monoclonal antibody inhibition of priming Monoclonal antibodies were purified by protein A affinity chromatography. gels were dried and P was detected by phosphorimage analysis. priming signal normalized to translation efficiency as described above. immunoprecipitation (Protocol 1) Protein A/G beads (Calbiochem) were suspended in either RIPA (20 mM Tris pH 7.2,150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] or IPP150. excess monoclonal antibodies were added to protein A/G beads and rocked at 4\u00b0. gCl2 and [-32P]dGTP were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0 for 30 minutes. aliquot of the in vitro translation was removed prior to the priming reaction and resolved by SDS-PAGE to monitor translation efficiency. peptides were synthesized and suspended in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) at 100 mM. peptides were then diluted to 10 mM in 10% DMSO with water. the final concentration of DMSO was 1%. we chose IPP150 as the low stringency buffer because P retains sequence-specific RNA binding activity in this buffer (16) if these conditions are met, it can be concluded that detergent treatment can cause conformational changes in the protein and binding sites may be present. mAbs 5, 6 and 10 immunoprecipitate P only under partially denaturing conditions. gene alignment and mutagenesis can help identify putative contact sites. mutagenesis can be used to test if an implicated region is a potential. mutations can expose epitopes that are normally obscured in low detergent buffer. mutations can expose epitopes that are normally obscured. mutations that did not affect binding at the putative contact site were immunoprecipitated. mabs that alter the function of the protein must be able to bind their epitopes. those that have no effect on the protein may not be able to bind. mutations can alter partial proteolysis pattern on P. ligand leading to a dose-dependent decrease in protein activity. this experiment is useful because the previous techniques only imply a binding interaction. however, successful displacement of a ligand through peptide competition directly indicates binding. differential immunoprecipitation involves using antibodies or other sequence specific reagents to precipitate a protein under different buffer conditions. at least one of the antibodies needs to recognize its epitope and immunoprecipitate (IP) the protein in the high detergent conditions. differential IP using a panel of mAbs and two different buffers. only mAbs 9, 11 and 12 recognize their epitopes. mutagenesis (C) and peptide competition (D) can disrupt binding of the ligand. hepadnaviruses will not be amenable to this analysis because there will be too many regions that are similar. other genetic features that can aid in identification of potential binding sites include hydrophilicity and secondary structure analyses. mAbs 5, 6 and 10 were exposed both by mutations at the contact site and high detergent. partial proteolysis can be used to probe protein structure because proteases recognize and cleave proteins at specific motifs. the rate of cleavage can be influenced by sequence context and fold of the protein. mabs that alter the function of the protein must be able to bind their epitopes. those that have no effect on the protein may not be able to bind. this technique provides epitope exposure information and shows direct inhibitory effects of binding. a peptide containing the same amino acids whose order has been scrambled is also an excellent control to demonstrate specificity for the putative ligand. we have excluded this possibility by showing that a purified active truncation of P, which does not require interactions with any chaperones, is inhibited by the peptide. protein contact sites are important because they are involved in almost every biological process and are therefore fundamental to cellular function. both cellular and viral protein contacts have been targeted for disruption. peptides have been effective in blocking the interaction between the cellular protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. aspirate medium and replace with 300 ul buffer containing 0.1 ug/ul bovine serum albumin.
