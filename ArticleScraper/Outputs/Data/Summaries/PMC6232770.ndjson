{"summary": "bocavirus 1 is associated with respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal infections. it is presumed that HBoV is persisting in a replicative but subclinical state, and is a pathogen rather than an innocent bystander. previous studies suggest that HBoV is associated with some lung and colorectal tumors. hepatitis B virus (HBV) leads to a chronic inflammation and culminating in organ-fibrosis. profibrotic and pro-cancerogenic chemokines are upregulated in vitro and in vivo. this suggests that HBoV is directly or indirectly involved in tumorigenesis. we cultivated primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes of tonsil tissue. we infected them with virulent HBoV particles to ascertain which the target cells for virus replication are. the interaction between HBoV and the host genome may influence the microsatellite stability in tonsillar tumors. HBoV real-time PCR was performed as previously described. FFPE tumor tissues were cut into slices of 3-m and mounted on slides. slides were treated according to the ZytoLight SPEC ALK/EML4 triCHeck probe protocol. penicillin/Streptomycin (104 U/ml each, BioWhittaker/Lonza, Switzerland) cells were cultured according to ATCC\u2019s recommendations. primary tonsil keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes were obtained from 11 patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis immediately after routine tonsillectomy. the infection of the tonsillar cultures was performed in 90% confluent fibroblast and keratinocytes cell dishes. the fibroblast infection was performed in triplicate, whereas the keratinocyte infection was conducted twice (in triplicate for one patient and as single infection for a second patient) the lymphocyte suspension cultures were infected at MOI 0.5 with HBoV1 inoculum immediately after preparation. atellite Instability Microsatellite instability testing was based on a previously published protocol using multiplex PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. the protocol was de-multiplexed and established on the QiaXcel Advanced system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) all samples were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart22 (Pathofinder, Netherlands) being able to detect 22 respiratory pathogens, including HBoV and Adenovirus. HPV detection was performed by the HPV 3.5 LCD-Array (Chipron, Berlin, Germany) cell culture All cultures were performed with 1% v/v Penicillin/Streptomycin. primary tonsil keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes were obtained from 11 patients with chronic tonsillitis immediately after routine tonsillectomy. fibroblasts and keratinocytes were infected at MOI 0.5 with HBoV1 Geq in 3 ml cell medium. lymphocyte suspension cultures were infected at MOI 0.5 with HBoV1 inoculum immediately after preparation. supernatant of keratinocyte culture was removed and kept for quantitative HBoV1 PCR. HBoV DNA was extracted with the Maxwell RNA kit. the supernatant and the harvested cells were subjected to a real-time HBoV-1 PCR for a quantitative analysis of viral genomes. the protocol was de-multiplexed and established on the QiaXcel Advanced system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) a single HPV infection and in 19 of 103 (18.4%) a single HBoV infection. all samples were negative for the other 21 airway pathogens tested by the RespiFinder assay. in 3 of 40 tumors we could observe a heterogeneous image with double infected cells and single infections in the same section. in 22 cases (35.4%) of all HBoV positive samples HPV DNA was not detected in the chronic tonsillitis tissue sections. HPV + HPV - Stage 1 4 (33.3%) 8 (66.7%) Stage 2 5 (83.3%) 1 (16.7%) Stage 3 16 (66.7%) 8 (33.3%) Stage 4a 37 (64.9%) 20 (35.1%) Stage 4b 3 (100%) 0 (100%) Pearson correlation coefficient rPearson = 0.9213; coefficient of determination r2 = 0.8487. wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt w wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt wt w in one infected well of one patient we observed a virus replication after 3 days in accordance with the typical virus growth curve. however, in the remaining three HBoV infected cultures of the other patient there was no virus replication measurable. in the remaining three HBoV infected cultures of the other patient there was no virus replication measurable, indicating this cell types are not permissive for HBoV. the prevalence of HBoV is statistically significant higher in tonsillar tumor sections than in chronically inflamed tonsils (p = 0.037 by Chi-square test) the prevalence of HBoV is statistically significant higher in tonsillar tumor sections than in chronically inflamed tonsils (p = 0.037 by Chi-square test) we could carefully speculate that HBoV as a single stranded DNA virus can act in a similar way or utilize related mechanisms like HBV. it is known that the incidence of human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer is increasing especially in developed countries up to 60 to 80%. keratinocytes represent a HBoV permissive cell in the tonsil. the lack of repetitions of the infection was mainly caused by the fact that only cells from one patient were permissive for the virus. the observation that HBoV can persist in infected tonsil squamous cell carcinomas and chronic infected tonsils has to be discussed from different perspectives. HBoV appears to be the first known autonomous parvovirus whose replication appears to be independent of the cell cycle, which is different from the parvoviruses mentioned above. however, we could not detect HBoV in breast, cervical or renal tumors. HBoV and HPV occur in the same cells and their possible synergistic interaction with other factors that eventually lead to malignant progression. the fact that no increased MSI is observed in tonsillar tumors makes it unlikely that the virus interacts directly with the host genome but more likely persists in episomal form."}
