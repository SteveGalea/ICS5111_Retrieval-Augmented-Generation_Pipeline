{"summary": "a line listing contained 1,291 cases of MERS-CoV infection pulled from a number of sources, including the world health organization and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. the results available are as reported and do not necessarily reflect the final status of the patient after prolonged follow-up. the outbreak in south Korea was excluded from the analysis because of its unique nature. there were 920 cases with missing information on 1 or more variables (including outcome variables), making conventional complete-case analysis essentially impossible. we used a bootstrap-based expectation maximization method to multiply impute the missing information. a ridge prior of 1% of the empirical data was used to assist with the numerical stability of the algorithm. line listing contained 1,291 cases of MERS-CoV infection pulled from a number of sources. the results available are as reported and do not necessarily reflect the final status of the patient after prolonged follow-up. the outbreak in south Korea was excluded from the analysis because of its unique nature. a ridge prior of 1% of the empirical data was used to assist with the numerical stability of the algorithm. the ridge prior adds an additional number of observations equal to 1% of the data set with the same mean and variance as the observed data, but with no covariance. this shrinks the covariance between the variables in the imputation model and assists the algorithm in converging on a stable solution. respiratory syndrome coronavirus from 2012 to 2015 Variable All Patients Severe Cases No. % Mean (SD) No. % Mean (SD) Age, years 50 (18) 57 (17) Missing data 11 1.0 11 2.1 Time of onset (days since January 1, 2012) employment as a health-care worker and increased amount of time between disease onset and hospitalization had minor protective associations with reported mortality. older age and underlying comorbidity were associated with increased risks of mortality. female patients and cases with a later time of infection onset had lower risks of mortality. a multivariate model that adjusted for age, presence of comorbidity, reported contact with animals, health-care worker status, case type (primary vs. secondary), and patient sex. d Reported number of days between onset and subsequent hospitalization. ssian kernel-smoothed age distributions of fatal and nonfatal cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus from 2012 to 2015 are shown in Table 1.
