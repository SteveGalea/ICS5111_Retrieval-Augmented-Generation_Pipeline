{"summary": "MERS-CoV circulated throughout the human population (1, 2). lack of CoV-specific antiviral drugs or an effective vaccine has severely hampered efforts to combat the spread of this virus. it is therefore important to study the life cycle of the virus and the roles that viral proteins play in its propagation. the activities of SARS-CoV Nsp15 and MHV Nsp15 were reported to be significantly stimulated by Mn2+. previous studies have demonstrated that the recombinant SARS-CoV Nsp15 and MHV Nsp15 both existed in a monomer-trimer-hexamer equilibrium in solution. hexamerization lends structural support to maintain integrity of the active site. Nsp15 from both MHV and SARS-CoV can interact with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), thus affecting cell cycle-associated gene expression (19). MHV Nsp15 has been demonstrated to colocalize and interact with the viral primase Nsp8 and polymerase Nsp12 in vivo (20), suggesting its possible involvement in RNA replication and transcription. -Nsp15b Data collection statistics Unit cell dimensions a, b, c (145.6, 145.6, 96.7,, (\u00b0) 90.0, 90.0, 120.0 Space group H3 Wavelength used () 0.9798 Resolution () 50.0\u20132.70 (2.75\u20132.70) No. of reflections Total 222,454 (9,905) Unique 21,016 (1,065) Completeness (%) 100.0 (100.0) Avg I/(I) 10.6 ( dues 1 to 60 are folded into a small N-terminal domain. three antiparallel -strands (1 to 3) are observed forming a curved -sheet. the N-terminal domain is followed by a middle domain that contains a central -sheet (4, 7, 8, and 11) flanked by two small -helices (1 and 2) on either side. six protomers form a hexamer through the N- to N-terminal interaction. a dimer of trimers constitutes a hexameric architecture. make up the catalytic site within the C-terminal domain and polar residues forming hydrogen bond networks may be essential for protein function. the structures of MERS-Nsp15, SARS-Nsp15 (PDB code 2H85) and MHV (PDB code 2GTH) Nsp15 are superimposed together. monomers and trimers are shown separately, and RMSD of C atoms are listed. three highly conserved residues clustering in a positively charged groove are known to drive NendoU-mediated catalysis. the two catalytic histidines, H231 and H246, are located on a long, convoluted loop wedged between two adjacent -sheets. the third catalytic residue, K286, resides on strand 15. an arginine (R341) in MERS-Nsp15 replaces a lysine (K344) in SARS-Nsp15. residues that are not conserved revealed unique features in MERS-Nsp15. the structure of MERS-Nsp15 is colored magenta. sp15 in the absence of R1, R2, or R3 is set to 100%. the fluorescence intensity was measured at each RNA concentration. all mutants listed in panel A share melting temperatures and DSF profiles similar to those of wild-type Nsp15. alanine substitution of the three highly conserved residues (H231, H246, and K286) decreased RNase activity to the background level. Mutating R341 to lysine decreased NendoU activity to approximately 50% of the wild-type protein activity. RNA R1 exhibited the highest binding affinity to RNA R1. RNA R1 also had the highest inhibitory effect on NendoU activity. mutant S290A, which exhibited partly diminished activity, conferred a moderate decrease in RNA binding ability. 102.13 2.07 0.53 Y339A Very low 1,029.04 102.73 2.16 0.44 H231A ND 811.01 51.00 3.11 0.64 S290A 0.83 0.02 1,156.49 94.12 2.38 0.37 F285A 1.34 0.06 678.63 36.75 2.72 0.43 F285S 1.63 0.07 616.28 33.09 2.39 0.34 T241A ND 997.11 121.47 2. 3 bonds with the 1 oxygen atom of T48 on the loop connecting strand 10 with helix 2 in the middle domain of another protomer. the nitrogen atom of 2 N157 on the turn connecting strand 10 with strand 11 stacks against the 1 oxygen atom of T278 on 14. the 1 oxygen atom of Y58 on helix 2 stacks against the oxygen atom of E263 on strand 13 in the C-terminal domain. ifugation analysis was conducted to assess the oligomeric forms of soluble and stable variants. mutant D39A existed primarily as a hexamer, while mutant E263A was distributed equally between the monomer and hexamer states. by comparison, mutants N38A, Y58A, and N157A existed predominately as monomers. hexameric mutant D39A bound to RNA R1 with a binding affinity (626.22 24.80 nM) higher than that of the wild-type protein. mutant E263A retained impaired binding affinity (1,013.43 77.38 nM), matching its moderately inhibited activity. the mutants harbored the K286A mutation to avoid digestion of the RNA substrate. the mutants harbored the mutation to avoid digestion of the RNA substrate. the Kd value and Hill coefficient of the wild-type protein were measured.

MST binding curves for the titration of fluorescently labeled Nsp15 into Nsp8 (green) and Nsp12 (orange) p8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex by microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay revealed binding between Nsp15 and Nsp8 with a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 16.33 3.21 M. as a control, Nsp7 alone displayed no binding to Nsp15 by MST. activity of the monomeric N157A protein increased by 33% in the presence of Nsp8 and increased by 40% in the presence of Nsp7/Nsp8. however, the activity of the monomeric N157A protein was similar in the presence of Nsp8 or Nsp7/Nsp8. the effect of serine substitution on activity enhancement was more dramatic than that of alanine substitution. hexameric mutant D39A from SARS-Nsp15 exhibited higher activity than wild-type protein. hexameric mutant D39A from SARS-Nsp15 exhibited no activity (10) structures of MERS-Nsp15 and its orthologs all show no obvious metal binding sites, arguing against the direct involvement of Mn2+. more information is needed to elucidate the roles that Mn2+ and Mg2+ play in the catalytic process. sp12 and Nsp15 by IP were a result of the indirect binding of Nsp8 with Nsp8 instead of the direct binding with Nsp15. this increase was observed only for the hexameric state of Nsp15. the mechanism through which NendoU activity is enhanced by Nsp8 and Nsp7/Nsp8 complex remains unclear. the sequence encoding the MERS-Nsp15 protein was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. a hexahistidine tag was inserted at the N-terminal end via PCR. the PCR product was then cloned into the pRSF-Duet1 vector. soluble supernatant was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. soluble supernatant was fractionated via a superdex 200 10/300 column. protein was concentrated to 8 mg/ml for crystal screening or stored at 80\u00b0C. crystals were grown overnight in a mixture of 1 l protein and 1 l reservoir solution. crystals were transferred to a cryoprotected buffer (reservoir solution and 25% glycerol) each 20-l reaction mixture contained 0.5 mg/ml purified protein. the temperature was held for 10 s and increased from 25\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C.
