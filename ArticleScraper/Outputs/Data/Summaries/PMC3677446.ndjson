{"summary": "results show deep phylogenetic structure in the Bd tree. we inferred phylogenetic relationships among the 29 isolates sequenced in this study based on an average of 24 sequencing depth per isolate and 101,931 nuclear SNPs. x and y axes show GPL node height in millions of years. supercontigs 10, 15, 16, and 17 did not contain clear LOH blocks. average mean divergence date for the GPL was significantly younger (P 0.001) compared with non-LOH regions. novel and endemic pathogen hypotheses generate different predictions for genetic variation within Bd. if Bd was entirely novel, we would expect deep phylogenetic structure in the Bd tree corresponding to geographic locality and/or host association. if Bd was entirely novel, we would expect a shallow and comb-like tree topology. the novel pathogen hypothesis is supported in particular locations by unambiguous spatiotemporal evidence. recent introductions occurred from an ancestral pool of variation that is deeper than previously considered. we could identify lineages that were more basal in the Bd tree. the true origin of Bd may never be resolved, even with exhaustive sampling of contemporary Bd isolates. we applied a molecular clock to estimate the age of key nodes within our tree. the dates provided are dependent on an assumed rate of evolution under a strict clock. 104,700 y B.P. for the entire Bd tree was estimated to be 26,400 y B.P. an age for the most recent common ancestor of the GPL was 26,400 y B.P. if the age of the GPL is estimated solely by the LOH region on supercontig 2, the GPL seems much younger (1,024 y with a confidence range of 500\u20131,500 y) the young date estimated from this genomic segment is still older than\u2014but within one order of magnitude of\u2014the divergence date presented by Farrer et al. black bars represent all data from the largest 16 supercontigs. white bars represent only non-LOH regions. elevated heterozygosity in the putative hybrid isolate CLFT024-02. the high variance in FIS and the large range of heterozygosity values across isolates could be caused by either rare sexual reproduction or mitotic recombination (27, 30). with sexual recombination within the GPL, we expect a positive correlation between chromosome size and heterozygosity, because randomly placed mitotic cross-overs affect a larger number of base pairs as chromosome sizes increase. only a handful of isolates showed consistent patterns of disomy across their entire genomes (e.g., UM142, TST75, MLA1, and SRS812) some isolates showed elevated copy numbers at most chromosomal segments but not consistently across the genome. chromosomal copy number was a poor indicator of relatedness in general. some LOH breakpoints were shared across isolates. a pattern difficult to explain with selection and recombination. a future work is needed to determine whether specific triggers lead to CNV and LOH. specific genes showed high dN/dS ratios, including some protease genes in expanded gene families such as BDEG_05170 (fungalysin metallopeptidase), BDEG_02225, and BDEG_03861 (aspartyl proteases). GO enrichment analyses to determine whether LOH or CNV gene regions disproportionately contained genes that could play a role in Bd pathogenesis. our results indicate that Bd lineages are older, more diverse, and exhibit more heterogeneous and dynamic genomic architecture than previously documented. additional efforts to describe the evolutionary diversity in the lineages currently grouped as Bd are essential to further reveal phylogenetic structure. our results show deep phylogenetic structure in the Bd tree. we inferred the phylogenetic relationships among the 29 isolates sequenced in this study based on an average of 24 sequencing depth per isolate and 101,931 nuclear SNPs. both analyses were rooted with the closest known non-Bd chytrid (Hp), allowing us to infer the order of branching events. rooted Bd phylogeny for 49 isolates based on 76,515 SNPs. maximum parsimony tree is shown with nodal support values generated from 200 bootstrap replicates. estimated divergence dates for the GPL based on different partitions of the largest supercontigs of the Bd genome. the diversity within the Bd tree represents variation within a single species or deeper taxonomic variation. without additional sampling, it is premature to consider whether the diversity within the Bd tree represents variation within a single species. the evolutionary history of Bd is more ancient than suggested by the novel pathogen hypothesis. even the GPL, which contains closely related and globally dispersed isolates, is not genetically homogenous. the novel pathogen hypothesis is supported in particular locations. a previous study suggested that novelty could arise by hybridization of Bd-Brazil with GPL isolates. however, both bullfrog and Brazilian isolates were scattered throughout our tree. our analyses revealed deeply branching lineages from Brazil and Africa. the dates provided are dependent on an assumed rate of evolution under a strict clock (i.e., 0.0081 substitutions per site per million years) and a tree prior derived from the constant population-size coalescent (42) the root for the entire Bd tree was estimated to be 104,700 y B.P. if the GPL is, in fact, tens of thousands of years old, the reduced variation in the LOH region on supercontig 2 could be caused by purifying selection, ongoing gene conversion, or a selective sweep propagated through the GPL. if the age of the GPL is estimated solely by the LOH region on supercontig 2, the GPL seems much younger (1,024 y with a confidence range of 500\u20131,500 y) hybridization has been proposed as a potential explanatory mechanism for the origin of the GPL clade as a whole. we show that isolate CLFT024-02 has elevated heterozygosity with nearly double the percentage of heterozygous SNPs than the other sampled isolates. supercontigs have been rearranged to form clusters according to Euclidean distances. we also looked for genomic evidence of recurrent sexual reproduction in Bd. recurrent sexual reproduction will lead to an inbreeding coefficient (FIS) (44) of zero. we documented extensive aneuploidy among isolates and among chromosomal segments within isolates. chromosomal copy number varied among our samples from monosomic to tetrasomic. only a handful of isolates showed consistent patterns of disomy across their entire genomes. LOH by mitotic recombination has been proposed as a mechanism for the uneven distribution of genetic variation within and among Bd isolates. the average total size of LOH blocks across the genome was 7.7 3.7 megabases (Mb), spanning a large proportion of the 25-Mb genome. shared ancestry seems the most likely explanation. specific genes showed high dN/dS ratios, including some protease genes in expanded gene families. we found significant enrichment of genes encoding proteins in processes of reactive oxygen metabolism (P 0.002), l-serine metabolism (P 0.003) and superoxide dismutase and oxidoreductase activities (P 0.002) plication events in these gene families range from tens of thousands to tens of millions of years (49), suggesting that the protease gene family expansions occurred well before the spread of the GPL. other nonprotease gene family expansions have also recently been identified that could affect Bd cell wall and adhesion properties. our data show that Bd has a deep and complex evolutionary history. key nodes in the Bd tree are older than observed amphibian die offs. we need to focus on understanding genetic and environmental control of disease dynamics in parts of the world. we used BEAST (v 1.7.3; 40) to sample from the posterior density of time-calibrated trees. also conducted divergence\u2013time analyses using datasets subsampled at the level of the supercontig."}
