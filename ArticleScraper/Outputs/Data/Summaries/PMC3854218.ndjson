{"summary": "myocardial hypertrophy is defined as a thickening of the myocardium. it results in a decrease in the size of the chamber of the heart. it is an important risk factor for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. the pathophysiology and role of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in heart disease have been investigated. more detailed mechanisms have been described in recent years. include mitochondrial oxidative stress (6), autophagy (7,8), p70-S6 protein kinase (9), nitric oxide (10), focal adhesion kinase (11), and AMP-activated protein kinase (12,13). Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is largely unknown. Sprague-Dawley rats (18-20 g) were supplied by the Animal Center of Guangzhou Medical University. rats were housed and used in accordance with our institutional guidelines for animal care and the Guide for animal care of the national institutes of health. cardiomyocytes were divided into four groups: control group (0.1 M PBS), HGF-treated group (10 ng/mL), Ang II-treated group (1 M), and HGF (10 ng/mL) plus Ang II (1 M)-treated group. the cells were treated with these agents for 24, 48, and 72 h. real-time PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR system. a melting curve analysis was performed from 60\u00b0 to 85\u00b0C. data were evaluated with the Applied Biosystems software. the average cell size was determined by observation of 150 cells (50 cells/well 3 wells) the differences were evaluated by a two-tailed Student t-test (2 groups) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post hoc test (3 or more groups) using the SPSS software. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. the cardiomyocytes were fixed and stained by immunohistochemical methods using an anti-sarcomeric actin antibody (19). the purity of the cardiomyocytes was approximately 95%. the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then disrupted by the addition of 200 L 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.1 N NaOH. the solubilized cell lysates were added to 5 mL scintillation fluid. TC TTT TGC GAT CT-3\u2032 (antisense); -MHC: 5\u2032-TGC AGT TGA AGG C-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CAG GGC TTC ACA GGC AT-3\u2032 (antisense); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control and the amount of target was defined by the 2Ct method. Ang II (0.01 M) caused a slight but significant increase in [3H]-Leu incorporation compared to control (1494.58 65.00 vs 1188.83 72.20 cpm/well, respectively; P 0.05) at this concentration of Ang II, the mRNA levels of ANF and -MHC in primary cardiomyocytes were not changed. the highest concentration of Ang II tested (10 M) increased the [3H]-Leu incorporation only slightly (2414.67 56.70 vs 1188.83 72.20 cpm/well, respectively; P 0.01) at this concentration of Ang II, the mRNA levels of ANF and -MHC only increased by 1.65-fold. the highest concentration of HGF (100 ng/mL) did not further increase [3H]-Leu incorporation or mRNA levels compared to the lower concentration of HGF (10 ng/mL). Ang II and Ang II in combination induced a significant increase in [3H]-Leu incorporation and in ANF mRNA and -MHC mRNA levels. Ang II and Ang II in combination induced a significant increase in [3H]-Leu incorporation and in ANF mRNA and -MHC mRNA levels. HGF (10 ng/mL) and Ang II (1 M) significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of ANF and -MHC. compared to separate treatment with HGF (10 ng/mL) or Ang II (1 M) alone at these time points, both the HGF (10 ng/mL)-treated group showed an increase in cell size. Ang II was administered at a higher concentration (0.1 M), the [3H]-Leu incorporation increased to 1820 cpm/well, which was approximately 1.5-fold higher than the control group (P 0.01). Ang II = angiotensin II; ANF = atrial natriuretic factor; -MHC = -myosin heavy chain. the highest concentration of Ang II tested (10 M) increased the [3H]-Leu incorporation only slightly. at this concentration of Ang II, the mRNA levels of ANF and -MHC only increased by 1.65-fold and 2.08-fold, respectively. we chose 1 M as the optimal concentration of Ang II for subsequent experiments. -MHC mRNA Control 1113.45 62.58 1 0 1 0 1 2430.47 72.65* 2.33 0.04* 2.14 0.03* 10 3848 71.57* 3.32 0.08* 2.81 0.07* 100 3256 68.34* 3.01 0.01* 2.42 0.06* Data are reported as means SD for N = 6/concentration performed in triplicate. the effects of Ang II (1 M), HGF (10 ng/mL) and HGF (10 ng/mL) plus Ang II (1 M) on [3H]-Leu incorporation (A), the mRNA levels of ANF (B) and the mRNA levels of -MHC (C) in primary cardiomyocytes. combination treatment of Ang II increased cell size of cardiomyocytes further. Ang II (1 M), HGF (10 ng/mL) and Ang II (10 ng/mL) plus Ang II (1 M) on average cell size. pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cardiomyocyte size, but also by cardiomyocyte gene reprogramming. this is shown by the enhanced expression of fetal phenotypes of genes, such as skeletal -actin, -MHC, and ANF (32). Ang II and related proteins play key roles in cardiac fibroblast growth and collagen deposition following myocardial infarction (35). heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and widely used injectable anticoagulant, was found to potently inhibit Ang II-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (37). however, there has been no report to date on the combined effect of Ang II and any other protein on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. the ERK pathway has an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. the PI3K/Akt, Src, and STAT3 pathways also contribute to Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy."}
