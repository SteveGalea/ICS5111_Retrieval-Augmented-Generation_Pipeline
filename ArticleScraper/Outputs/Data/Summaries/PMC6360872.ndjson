{"summary": "TRIM55 plays a regulatory role in assembly of sarcomeres. but few studies have assessed its function in hepatocellular carcinoma. TRIM55 was downregulated in HCC tissues and was associated with prognosis. a recent study showed that TRIM55 regulates the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV infection. the function of TRIM55 on migration and invasion of HCC cells is unclear. the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University People\u2019s Hospital. all tissues and neighboring tissues of HCC patients were cut into 3-um slices, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in a series of graded alcohol dilutions. after exposure to 5% BSA for 30 min, all tissues were incubated with rabbit antibody to human TRIM55 antibody (Novus, NBP2-33691, dilution 1/200) overnight at 4\u00b0C. primary antibodies were as follows: TRIM55 (Novus, NBP2-33691, dilution 1/1000), E-cadherin and Vimentin (Cell Signaling Technology, (EMT) antibody sampler kit #9782, dilution 1/1000), and MMP2 (Proteintech, 10373-2-AP, dilution 1/1000), and the internal control was GAPDH (Abcam Biotechnology, Cambridge, UK, dilution the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University People\u2019s Hospital. all selected patients gave written informed consent. the follow-up was started i months after the operation. extract and RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent. reverse transcription was conducted by using Superscript III RT (Invitrogen). migration assays were conducted using Transwell plates (Corning, NY) cells were cultured with serum-free MEM with matrigel (invasion assay) or without matrigel (migration assay) for 48 h (invasion) or 24 h (migration assay) cells that invaded across the membranes on the bottom surface were counted and photographed. TRIM55 is downregulated in HCC tissues and is associated with prognosis of HCC patients. the level of TRIM55 expression between tissues and neighbor tissues was analyzed and shown as a pie chart. TRIM55 expression is an independent risk factor of HCC patients. TRIM55 can act as a tumor-suppressor gene during progression of HCC. the results showed that both protein and mRNA levels of TRIM55 were overexpressed by the TRIM55 ORF transfection system. Western blot was used to verify transfection efficiency at the protein level. GAPDH was used as internal control. IF was used to detect expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin, and MMP2 in HCC cells with TRIM55 overexpression and negative control. TRIM55 was downregulated in HCC tissues and is associated with clinicopathologic features of HCC patients. expression of TRIM55 was significantly associated with vessel invasion, tumor grade, and TNM stage. TRIM55 expression was an independent risk factor of HCC patients. chi-square tests were used for analysis of correlation between TRIM55 expression and clinical features. TRIM55 expression is an independent risk factor of HCC patients. TRIM55 expression is an independent predictive factor for overall survival time in HCC patients. TRIM55 overexpression in HCC cell lines was constructed. RT-PCR was used to verify transfection efficiency at the protein level. GAPDH was used as internal control. overexpression of TRIM55 decreases migration and invasion of HCC cells. TRIM55 is known as an important protein in regulating muscle differentiation and myofibrillogenesis. but its function in tumor migration and invasion is unclear. we first detected expression of TRIM55 in 100 paired HCC tissues. expression of E-cadherin was increased and expression of Vimentin decreased. TRIM55 can regulate migration and invasion of HCC cells through EMT and MMP2 pathway."}
