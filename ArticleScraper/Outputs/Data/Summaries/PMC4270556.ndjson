{"summary": "URTIs are the ailments triggered by an acute infection involving nose, sinuses, pharynx, or larynx. these infections are often caused by viruses like rhinovirus, corona virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus etc. about 10% of cases are caused by bacteria like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella perturis, Streptococcus pneumoniae etc. medicinal oils were derived from aromatic plants and resins by extraction into other fatty oils such as olive oil and used as a mixture [5-7] there has been an increase in the wide spread development of drug resistant microorganisms such as MRSA, multidrug resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia and P. Aeruginosa. the essential oils target bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane. the essential oil of Monarda punctata induced substantial and dose-dependent morphological changes in the Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strain killing more than 85% of the bacteria at higher concentration. the plant was identified by a well-known taxonomist. mass spectra: electron impact (EI+) mode, 70 ev and ion source temperature 250\u00b0C. identification of essential oil constituents was done on the basis of Retention Index. microorganism strains and culture media Streptococcus pyogenes were grown on nutrient agar plates at 37\u00b0C and maintained on nutrient agar slants. serial doubling dilutions of essential oils were prepared in a 96-well microtiter plate. each dilution (100 L) was dispensed into the wells, then inoculated with (100 L) of the bacterial suspension. the final concentration of each strain was adjusted to 105-106 CFU/mL. the bacterial cells were centrifuged at 8000 g for 15 minutes. the bacterial cells were then washed with 0.1 mol/l Tris-acetate buffer. each bacterial culture was observed by SEM (Hitachi, Japan) at magnifications of 10,000. flowers of monarda punctata were collected from a local region, china, during June-july 2013. the plant was identified by a well-known taxonomist. the extraction of the essential oil was carried out by hydrodistillation for 4 hours. pyogenes (ATCC 12344), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43300), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 2730), Escherichia coli (Clinical strain) were used in the present study. bacterial strains were grown on nutrient agar plates at 37\u00b0C. the final concentration of suspension of the strain was adjusted to 105-106 CFU/mL. a 50 L liquid from each dilution was spread on the surface of the agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. the solution with no essential oil was used as a control. the concentration of essential oil, thymol, limonene and p-cymene was 90 g/ml each. the number of bacterial cells used was adjusted to 105 CFU/ml. a total of 13 components were identified constituting 97.2% of the total oil composition. RI 3 -Pinene 0.9 MS, RI 4 -Phellandrene 0.1 MS, RI 5 -Terpinene 1.5 MS, RI 6 P-Cymene 6.7 MS, RI, Std 7 Carene 0.2 MS, RI 8 Limonene 5.4 MS, RI, Std 9 4-Terpineol 0.1 MS, RI 10 Methyl carvacrol 0.4 MS, RI 11 Th methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment. a further in-vitro experiment was carried out evaluating the antibacterial effects of the major constituents (thymol, p-cymene and limonene) the essential oil of Monarda punctata kills almost all the Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains within 12 h duration. the control did not contain essential oil. the images were taken at a magnification of 10,000 (A, S. pyogenes 12 h in saline; B-D. scanning electron micrographs of MRSA treated for 12 h with 30, 60, and 90 g/ml of the Monarda punctata essential oil. increased levels of ROS could trigger the formation of free radicals within bacterial cells which eventually cause serious membrane damage. erial cultures were treated with 90 g/ml each of these compounds and whole M.P essential oil for 4 h. the yield of the essential oil obtained from the flowers was 0.9% w/v. a total of 13 components were identified constituting 97.2% of the total oil composition. GC-MS Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) of the essential oil of Monarda punctata. antibacterial activity assessed against some respiratory infection. strains including Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. MIC and MBC values of thymol, p-cymene and limonene against different respiratory pathogens. MIC and MBC values of the essential oil and two known antibiotics against different respiratory pathogens. time kill curve studies give an idea whether the essential oil has bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects. the bacterial cells of S. aureus were swollen after 12 hours of essential oil treatment. three concentrations (30, 60, and 90 g/ml) of the essential oil were used. it induced dose-dependent cell morphological changes in the bacterial cells. bacterial cells treated with monarda punctata essential oil were treated with 90 g/ml each of these compounds and whole M.P essential oil for 4 h. increased levels of ROS could trigger the formation of free radicals within bacterial cells, which eventually cause serious membrane damage. essential oils are used in perfumes and make-up products, in dentistry, in agriculture, as food preservatives and additives, and as natural remedies. it is important to develop a better understanding in basic research applications, especially, of the anti-microbial activity. the essential oils exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activity which has led to an increased interest among scientists [24] the essential oil of Monarda punctata is a potent source of antibacterial agents against various respiratory tract infection causing microbes. the essential oil even caused serious morphological damage to the drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus which is very encouraging."}
