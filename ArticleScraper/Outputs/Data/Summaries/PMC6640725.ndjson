{"summary": "the application of microbubbles and ultrasound to deliver nanoparticle carriers for drug and gene delivery is a research area that has expanded greatly in recent years. recent studies reported that utilization of ultrasound microbubbles causes the so-called \u201csonoporation\u201d effect (4, 5), which has been recognized as a significant factor in transient disruption of cell membrane permeability (6). LIUS was reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells including nasopharyngeal cancer cells (42), laryngeal cancer cells (43), hepatocellular cancer cells (43, 44), leukemia cells (45), lymphoma cells (46), and osteosarcoma cells (47). however, it remains unclear how LIUS can distinguish cancer cells from non-cancer cells and induce differential biological responses. 299 cell death regulators were responsible for regulating 13 different types of cell death mechanisms. these genes were responsible for regulating apoptosis, MPT-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosomal dependent cell death (LCDC), autophagy dependent cell death (ADCD), immunogenic cell death (ICD), mitoto chromosome conformation capture carbon copy-sequencing (5C-seq) (57) that capture chromosome conformation allow determination of interactions between the target genes and CLRI sites. the unique CLRI seen in genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells and non-cancer cells may play a role in producing a differential response. cancer GSE45487 Mus musculus MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells 0.03 W/cm2, 1.5 MHz. 20 min 24252911 GSE70662 Rattus

LIUS induced upregulation of 13 genes in lymphoma cells. downregulated 12 genes such as HK2, CASP5, TLR7, MAP2K5, CD47, ATM, CDC25C, TTK, SRC, PDGFRA, ITGB1 and ITGB3. this may suggest that cell death regulators modulated by LIUS treatment activate intricate signaling mechanisms. anoikis ANXA1 4.294 ICD FPR1 4.701 ICD PANX1 1.913 Pyroptosis, ICD TP53 2.723 Apoptosis, MPT-driven necrosis, Ferroptosis, ADCD, Mitotic death Gene number 13 Gene number 9 Downregulate HK2 1.860 MPT-driven necrosis BIRC5 2.642 Apoptosis CASP5 3.734 Pyropto the top 20 pathways that are modulated by LIUS in cancer cells are not shared. most of the cell death regulator genes downregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are responsible for mediating inflammatory signaling pathways. regulators that were downregulated by LIUS treatment seem to attenuate several pro-inflammatory pathways. these include neuroinflammation signaling pathway, inflammasome pathway, NF-B signaling, TREM1 signaling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, HMGB1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, altered T cell and LIUS inhibits the expression of a list of inflammation-related cell death regulators, potentially via TP53-, and SRF-Mediated Pathways in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. we found that tumor suppressor gene TP53 (73) was upregulated by LIUS treatment in cancer cells; and that serum response factor (SRF) was upregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells. modulation of transcription factors such as TP-53 and SRF-1 may play a role in altered cell death regulator gene expression seen in LIUS-treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells. LIUS modulate expression of cell death regulators potentially via transcription factors TP53-, and SRF-, mediated pathways in cancer cells and non-cancer cells respectively. thermal effects and osmotic shear stress Associated with LIUS may promote gene expression changes of the cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. the biological effects of ultrasound are separated into thermal and non-thermal effects. the differences in expressions of GAK in three microarrays may be due to the potential differences of used LIUS methods and parameters as well as cell types. we then hypothesized that thermal effects partially underlie the LIUS induced modulation of the cell death regulatome. LD, EZR, VAMP1, ANAX1, and FPR1 were increased in mild hyperthermia treated cancer cells. expression of TLR7, MAP2K7, and SRC were downregulated in both data sets. also, upregulation of the transcription factor TP-53 may occur due to mild hyperthermia associated with LIUS in cancer cells. 25 1.797 TNFRSF25 6.836 NT5E 8.598 TLR3 27.497 ANXA1 1.655 ATG7 1.799 FPR1 9.078 MAP1LC3B2 3.834 CDC25A 1.534 BCL2 9.434 BUB1 2.325 PLK2 10.193 AURKC 2.783 EGFR 1.77 ITGB1 10.408 ITGB3 3.54 FAS 2.16 ATG5 3.488 we analyzed whether there are similarities between the signaling pathways that were shared by cell death regulator genes that were upregulated by LIUS and mild hyperthermia in cancer cells. these cell signaling pathways are granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, Huntington's disease signaling, and molecular mechanisms of cancer. the down regulated cell death regulators in cancer cells treated by LIUS or mild hyperthermia shared 2 signaling pathways. non-thermal effects such as oscillatory shear stress (OSS) partially underlie LIUS induced modulation of cell death regulators. OSS-induced upregulation of 4 out of 299 cell death regulators involved in four cell death types. ten out of 13 cell death types involved in apoptosis and ferroptosis. non-thermal effects of LIUS such as OSS may be responsible for inducing biological effects observed in non-cancer cells. we analyzed whether LIUS treatment exerts any expression changes of genes that regulate ROS generation while downregulating the expression of GPX3 that has the potential to exert antioxidant effects. LIUS promotes the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzymes in cancer cells. it enhances the expression of antioxidant enzymes in non-cancer cells. it is well-known that ROS can indeed impact the cell viability by affecting activity of caspases, mitochondrial function and activating apoptotic pathways. the gene list of chromosome conformation regulators was extracted from related report (PMID: 28698768), detailed information. the red highlights indicate increased fold changes, and green highlights indicate decreased fold changes. OSS has the tendency to exert anti-inflammatory effects in non-cancer cells. LIUS modulated the expression of chromosome conformation regulators in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. the gene list of chromosome conformation regulators was extracted from related report (PMID: 22675074), detailed information. differential gene expression seen between LIUS treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells was due to differences in the CLRIs of the modulated genes Figures 4A\u2013C. we then calculated the distances between 555 interacting sites (Figure 4D) with respect to LIUS-modulated gene promoters. long-range interaction sites of LIUS regulated genes in cancer cells mostly located between 107 and 105 upstream. but in non-cancer cells, the long-range interactions sites of LIUS regulated genes were concentrated between 105 and 107 bp downstream. a common feature of the CLRISs with LIUS modulated genes in cancer cells is associated with LIUS upregulation of GATA2 in Table 10. chromosome conformation capture sequencing was needed to examine LIUS-treated cancer cells and non-cancer cells. the results show that LIUS induced a differential gene expression pattern in the cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. the results may suggest that optimal CLRISs may serve as new therapeutic targets in the future to enhance LIUS-mediated cancer cell suppression. m2) Frequency (MHz) Exposure time Cancer suppression 1.35 1.7 24 h Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells Induce cellular apoptosis and autophagy Unclear 22977587 1.75-2.5 1 0.5 min Laryngeal carcinoma cells Induce cellular apoptosis and necrosis Mitochondrial pathway and oxidative stress pathway 20498470 0.3 1 1 min Leukemia cells Induce cellular apoptosis our study Low intensity ultrasound 0.33 W/cm2, 2 MHz, 4 min 0.3 W/cm2,1.0 MHz,1 min; 0.03 W/cm2,1.5 MHz, 20 min; LIPUS,15 min/day 7day Cancer vs. non-cancer Cancer cells. 299 genes regulate all the 13 cell death types including apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome dependent cell death (LDCD), autophagy dependent cell death (ADCD), immunogenic cell death (ICD), mitotic death, and anoikis. LIUS exerts a profound effect on the expression of cell death regulators in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. this may suggest that the cell death regulators modulated by LIUS treatment activate intricate signaling mechanisms that may cause an impact on cell death in cancer cells. 06 Apoptosis MAP2K5 3.208 NETotic cell death E2F1 2.946 Apoptosis CD47 15.995 ICD E2F8 2.603 Apoptosis ATM 2.035 Mitotic death CCND1 1.945 Apoptosis CDC25C 1.933 Mitotic death GCLC 1.513 Ferroptosis TTK 1.713 Mitotic death CASP1 1.537 Pyroptosis SRC 1.985 Anoiki top 20 pathways that are modulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are not shared. most of the cell death regulator genes downregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are responsible for mediating inflammatory signaling pathways. LIUS treatment exerts a profound effect on cell the gene expression of the cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. second, LIUS treatment has the tendency to reduce the expression of cell death regulators than activating them in non-cancer cells. TP53 plays a role in regulating cell death regulator genes modulated by LIUS. a list of TP53-downregulated cell death regulators were upregulated in human TP53 knock-down (KD) mesenchymal stem cell datasets. these results suggest that LIUS has the potential to regulate cell death regulator expression in cancer cells partially via inducing tumor suppressor transcription factor TP53. m Cells Colorectal carcinoma-derived cell lines Cardiomyocyte Treatment p53 knock-down p53 knock-out SRF knock-out LIUS-upregulated cell death regulators in cancer cells (13) BOK, CASP10, CYLD, DPP4, EZR, ATG3, ATG16L1, VAMP1, CXCL10, ANXA1, FPR1, PANX1 TP53 21.752 2.941 LIUS-downregulated gene in non-car biological effects of ultrasound are separated into thermal and non-thermal effects. thermal effects of ultrasound depend on ultrasound exposure parameters, tissue properties and beam configuration. thermal effects of ultrasound arise from absorption of ultrasonic energy and creation of heat. acoustic radiation force, radiation torque, acoustic streaming, shock wave, and shear stress are considered non-thermal effects of ultrasound. osmotic shear stress associated with LIUS may promote cell death regulator gene expression changes in cancer.

OSS treatment did not affect the expression of cell death regulators involved in three cell death types. despite the fact that OSS treatment did not modulate similar set of genes in non-cancer cells, we found that the cell death regulator genes that were upregulated by both treatments share three signaling pathways. grade reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation helps to mediate signaling that maintains the homeostasis of the cells. however, excess production of ROS can be detrimental to the cells by activating cell death pathways. LIUS exerts cancer suppressing effects by inducing ROS generation, which result in mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death. thermia Oscillatory Disease Cancer Non-cancer Non-cancer Cell Lymphoma U937 cells MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells Bone marrow cells Lymphoma U937 cells Fibroblast OUMS-36 cells Human lymphatic endothelial cells GEO ID GSE10212 GSE45487 GSE70662 GSE10043 GSE39178 GSE60512 ROS generating enzyme XDH NOX chromatin long range interactions (CLRI) differentially regulate gene promoters to differentiate LIUS-modulated gene expression in cancer cells vs. non-cancer cells.
