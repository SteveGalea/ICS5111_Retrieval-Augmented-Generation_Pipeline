{"summary": "the epidemic of ebola virus disease (EVD) that raged through western africa between 2013 and 2016 was the most severe epidemic in recorded history [1,2]. a strategy is to identify approved drugs that show anti-EBOV activity [20\u201328], with the goal of repurposing them for an anti-EBOV therapeutic, either alone or as part of a multi-component regimen [29\u201334]. apilimod is a small molecule that binds to and inhibits the phosphotransferase activity of PIKfyve [54]. the drug was developed as a suppressor of interleukin 12 and 23 production [55], and was tested in phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease [56,57], psoriasis [58], and rheumatoid arthritis [59]. cells vero E6 (African green monkey kidney; ATCC 1586) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) Huh 7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were obtained from Dr. Hideki Ebihara (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), Rocky Mountain Laboratories. fetal bovine serum (FBS, Seradigm, VWR International, Radnor, PA) or 10% cosmic calf serum (CCS, Hyclone) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO; Cat# T7204-25MG) and apilimod (CAS 541550-19-0) was purchased from Axon MedChem (Groningen, NL; Cat# 1369) drugs dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS. the drug solutions were diluted two-fold in an 8-point dilution series. cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin. cell viability measured using cellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit. Luminescence was read on an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader. inhibition measured as percent relative to untreated infected cells. the entry assay scores the ability of lam-VP40 (from incoming entry reporter VLPs) to cleave a lam substrate preloaded into the target cell cytoplasm. 30,000 HEK 293T/17 cells or BSC-1 cells were seeded per well in a clear 96-well plate. microliters of cellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega, Madison WI, USA) were removed and replaced with 50 L of fresh medium per well. after overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with 4 mL fresh growth medium containing 5% FBS. the medium in each well was replaced with 4 mL fresh growth medium. trVLP assay measures ability of trVLPs containing a tetracistronic EBOV minigenome to infect target cells pretransfected with plasmids encoding proteins. if trVLPs enter target cells, the minigenome is replicated and transcribed, leading to Renilla luciferase reporter activity [64,65] 40L of cellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega) was then added to each well. plate placed on a Jitterbug orbital shaker (575 rpm) for 2 min at RT. luminescent signal detected using a Synergy HT plate reader. cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes coated with 20 g/mL fibronectin. assay of cholesterol accumulation BSC-1 cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes. cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes coated with 20 g/mL fibronectin. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. primary antibodies (1:1000 rabbit -NPC1, (Abcam) or 1:1000 mouse -early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) were added for 45 min at room temperature. secondary antibodies (1:1500 -mouse or -rabbit AlexaFluor 488, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added for 30 min at RT. rgEBOV-luc2 Thirty-five drugs obtained from the national center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) were dissolved in DMSO at 500 M. drugs were added to confluent Vero E6 cells. 50 l of DMEM/PS/Q without virus was added to the cells. cells were incubated for 2 min on an orbital shaker at 60 RPM. at 48 h, 100 l of supernatant was removed, and 50 l of Promega was added. the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. cell medium containing pseudovirus was collected, pooled, and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 250 x g for 7 min. the cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with apilimod. infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then washed once with PBS and overlaid with 50L. high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. either 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS; Hyclone, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for HEK 293T/17 cells or 10% cosmic calf serum (CCS, Hyclone) for BSC-1 cells. 96 vero E6 and Huh 7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well. hMDMs were plated at a density of 1 x 105 cells/well 24 h prior to the addition of drugs. each cell type was infected with EBOV or MARV at a multiplicity of infection. Luminescence was detected using an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader. 1 black opaque cell plate for each cell type was mock infected (no virus) after 48 h, cell viability was measured using the cellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit. the final VLP pellet was resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) the total protein concentration of the VLPs was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. all entry-reporter VLP preparations were assessed by western blot analyses. cells were incubated overnight at RT and then fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. 3 x 104 HEK 293T/17 cells were seeded and grown as above. after overnight incubation, medium was removed and replaced with 50 L of fresh medium per well. minigenome plasmid encodes Renilla luciferase, matrix protein VP40, nucleocapsid associated protein VP24, and GP from EBOV. 96 h after transfection, the medium was harvested, pooled, and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 g. 40 L of RenillaGlo substrate (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was then added to each well. plate immediately analyzed on a GloMax plate reader. cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. cells were seeded in 35mm glass bottom dishes coated with 20 g/mL fibronectin. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. images were then taken using a 100X, 1.45 numerical aperture. assays of VLP trafficking experiments were performed in BSC-1 cells. cells were pretreated with apilimod or nocodazole (indicated concentrations) diluted in OMEM for 1h at 37\u00b0C prior to VLP addition. assay of cathepsin B+L activity was assayed as described previously. rgEBOV-luc2 was used as a positive control for inhibition at the indicated concentration. drug dissolved in DMSO at 500 M. firefly luciferase from an additional transcriptional unit was added to the cells. at 48 h, 100 l of supernatant was removed, and 50 l of Promega was added to the cells. cells were incubated for 2 min on an orbital shaker at 60 RPM. the cells were transfected with 2.4 g pTG-luc, 1.2 g pCMV-MLVgag-pol, 1.2 g pGPmucin and 1.2 g of MLV-gag-lam. the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. plasmids were encoding GFP-PIKfyve or pEGFP-Cl. the cells were re-seeded in 96 well opaque white plates. the cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with apilimod. two-fold dilutions of the drugs were tested in an 8-point dose-response curve. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 for 48 h. antiviral activity is shown in blue and cytotoxicity is shown in red. experiment was run on duplicate plates with triplicate wells per dose (mean SD; n = 3) the experiment was repeated on 2\u20134 days. a single representative graph is shown. apilimod inhibits VLP entry and trVLP infection with similar potency. HEK 293T/17 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentration of apilimod or DMSO (0 M) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after 3 h at 37\u00b0C, cell viability was determined. inhibition of EBOV entry by apilimod is mediated by PIKfyve. apilimod targets PIKfyve [54], since PIKfyve is required for EBOV entry and infection [37] limod blocks EBOV VLP entry into BSC-1 cells with the same approximate dose-dependency as its effects in HEK 293T/17 cells. apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV-GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes. VLPs were then bound to cells by spinfection in the presence of the indicated drug. cells were then washed, fixed, permeabilized, stained, and analyzed for VLP colocalization with NPC1. apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes. in apilimod-treated cells, EEA1+ endosomes appeared larger. in mock-treated cells, EEA1+ endosomes appeared larger. the white arrow indicates a VLP that is within an enlarged EEA1+ endosome. the value for VLP colocalization with EEA1 in apilimod-treated cells is likely an underestimate. apilimod appears to block filoviral entry and infection by blocking virus transport from early endosomes to their site of fusion in NPC1+ endolysosomes. Fig 8. Apilimod has no effect on cathepsin B+L activity. confluent dishes of BSC-1 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of apilimod, DMSO, or 10 M EST for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C, washed once with PBS, and imaged in cell imaging medium. Apilimod blocked EBOV infection of Huh 7 (liver) cells, vero E6 (kidney) cells, and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. the experiment was run on duplicate plates with triplicate wells per dose. the experiment was repeated on 2\u20134 days. a single representative graph is shown. IC50 values are mean values standard deviation from 4 to 8 dose response curves. bSI = CC50/IC50; Abbreviations: CC50, concentration with 50% cell viability; EBOV, Ebola virus; IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration; MARV, marburg virus; hMDM, human primary monocyte-derived macrophage; MOI, multiplicity of infection; SI, selectivity index Apilimod blocks EBOV particle entry. parallel HEK 293T/17 cells were pretreated as above. fected for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and infection by trVLPs was assayed. similar results for parallel tests of VLP entry and trVLP inhibition. apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection through a PIKfyve-dependent pathway. HEK 293T/17 cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PIKfyve or (as control) GFP. after 18 hr, the cells were reseeded into 96-well plates. EBOV VLP entry into BSC-1 cells with the same approximate dose-dependency as its effects in HEK 293T/17 cells. apilimod blocks trafficking of EBOV-GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes to a similar extent as nocodazole. VLP colocalization was monitored as above except samples were fixed at 0, 30, 60 or 90 min. the findings were obtained after allowing VLPs pre-bound to the cell surface to enter cells for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. BSC-1 cells were pretreated with DMSO (Mock) or 0.2 M apilimod for 1 h. samples were analyzed for VLP colocalization with EEA1 at 37\u00b0C. apilimod had no apparent direct effect on endosome acidification. bafilomycin, an inhibitor of EBOV infection that blocks endosome acidification, was used as a positive control. apilimod did not cause a detectable increase in cholesterol levels in endolysosomes. thepsin B+L activity was assayed using the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. the cells were grown overnight on 35 mm glass bottom dishes. the cells were incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C, washed once with PBS. apilimod emerged from a blinded screen of 35 drugs targeting cell signaling pathways. we demonstrated that apilimod has activity against both EBOV and MARV in several cell types. apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection in a PIKfyve-dependent manner. two Ca++ channels found in (endo)lysosomes are downstream effectors of PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2. PIKfyve has been shown to regulate the fission and consequent remodeling and maturation that reduces the size of macropinosomes containing endocytosed material from the cell surface and exterior. apilimod blocks EBOV entry by blocking particle delivery into endolysosomes. other approved drugs, including chloroquine, niclosamide, atovaquone, amodiaquine and quinacrine, block endosomal acidification. apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking by blocking microtubule-disrupting agents. apilimod has been tested in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. apilimod is a small molecule PIKfyve inhibitor that has proven safe in phase 2 clinical trials. apilimod blocks EBOV entry and infection in a PIKfyve-dependent manner. the inhibitory effect of apilimod on EBOV entry is likely due to a defect in the maturation of endolysosomes. PIKfyve and PI(3,5)P2 orchestrate endosome maturation is not known. apilimod blocks transport of EBOV particles to NPC1+ endolysosomes. interconnected effects of apilimod on PIKfyve [37,54], TPC2 [75] and endolysosome maturation culminate in its blockade of EBOV entry and infection. other approved drugs, including chloroquine, niclosamide, atovaquone, amodiaquine and quinacrine, block endosomal acid apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking by inhibiting PIKfyve. apilimod has similar anti-viral activity against EBOV and MARV. apilimod is a small molecule PIKfyve inhibitor that has proven safe. cells were pretreated for 2 h with compounds at indicated concentrations. cells were then infected with 1000 TCID50 of a reporter-expressing Ebola virus. cell viability was determined in drug-treated but non-infected cells using a commercial cell viability assay."}
