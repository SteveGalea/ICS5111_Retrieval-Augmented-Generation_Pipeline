{"summary": "most common reasons for antimicrobial use in cow-calf operations are respiratory disease and diarrhea in calves before weaning, respiratory disease in calves after weaning, and lameness in cows and bulls (2). a recent survey of 148 veterinarians from the united states and Canada who provided service to cow-calf clients summarized vaccine recommendations for calves at branding, weaning, post-weaning and annual vaccinations for breeding females. the most common target of vaccination was leptospirosis (32%) followed by BVDV (28%) and IBR (25%), and in bulls it was BVDV (24%) followed by leptospirosis (21%). the next available Canadian data resulted from a 2010 survey of 310 producers (14) the first section measured vaccine use between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 in 4 production groups: bulls, cows, unweaned calves, and weaned calves. the second section asked about diseases of most concern when choosing vaccines, producer motivations for vaccine use, factors influencing vaccine choices, and primary sources of information on vaccines. product names as reported by producers were manually linked to a list of vaccines licensed for use in Canada. additional details, including information on specific clostridial vaccine components, were obtained directly from individual product packaging materials. a paper-based survey was developed to assess vaccine use. national census data was used to target selection of cow-calf herds for the network within each province with the goal of matching reported distribution of herd sizes and herd density. veterinarians were asked to identify potential participants from their beef cattle clientele who pregnancy-checked and maintained basic calving and production records. 106 participants responded to the network within the previous 12 mo. thirty-seven percent of respondents (34/93) had > 300 cows and heifers. only 1 herd reported using a monovalent bacterin for Campylobacter fetus spp. venerealis in cows. all products containing leptospira antigens were combined with ML viral vaccines. 93 cow-calf herds reported as the proportion of herds (and number of herds) ML viral vaccines used from January 1 to December 31, 2016.
