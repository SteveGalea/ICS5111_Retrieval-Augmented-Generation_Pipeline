{"summary": "maintenance of the epigenome can only be guaranteed by correct positioning and activity of epigenetic modifiers across the genome, and may be threatened by proteotoxic stress. the polycomb group (PcG) protein family of epigenetic modifiers warrants proper regulation of stem cell self-renewal and cell lineage specification. a hierarchical model was proposed for PRC1/2 function, where the CBX subunit of PRC1 recognizes the PRC2 mark H3K27me3, placing PRC1 function downstream of PRC2. however, recent studies have shown that PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment to chromatin can also be independent of each other. HS leads to dramatic alterations of the 3D chromatin architecture. this is a consequence of weakening insulators between topologically associating domains (TADs) and newly formed architectural protein binding sites. HS does not cause a decrease but rather an increase in gene transcription. s accumulate in the nucleolus upon HS. the nucleolar accumulation coincides with a displacement of PRC1 and PRC2 from their target genes and a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. heat shock induces nucleolar relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to nucleoli. heat shock induces nucleolar relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to nucleoli. pRRL SFFV GFP-CBX2 localization in fixed untreated or heat shocked (30 min, 44\u00b0C) cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells. GFP-CBX2 localization in live K562 cells directly after HS. Western analysis of GFP pull-outs performed on K562 GFP and K562 GFP-CBX2 cells showing co-preciptation of endogenous RING1B and BMI1 with GFP-CBX2. Western analysis of GFP pull-outs performed on K562 GFP and K562 GFP-CBX2 cells showing co-preciptation of endogenous RING1B. HL60 cells stained with anti-CBX4 and anti-NPM1. the N-terminus of CBX2 and CBX8 including the chomo domain is sufficient for HS-induced nucleolar localization. all generated truncated GFP-CBX fusion proteins displayed nucleolar localization after HS, suggesting the presence of the chromodomain is sufficient to induce nucleolar localization after HS. kinetics of HS-induced relocalization of truncated CBX proteins were slightly slower, suggesting non-homologous peptide stretches in CBX proteins contribute to nucleolar relocalization. endogenous CBX4 and CBX8 were enriched in the nucleolar fraction after HS. also endogenous RING1B levels were slightly elevated in the nucleolar fraction after HS. cellular fractionation shows HS-induced nucleolar relocalization of endogenous Polycomb proteins. Western blot analyses of cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleoli fractions from untreated and heat-shocked HL60 cells stained with anti-Fibrillarin (FBL), anti-CBX4, anti-CBX8, anti-RING1B and anti-ACTIN antibodies. one of the most dramatic morphological changes in heat treated nuclei is the swelling of nucleoli. in total, we identified 1279 proteins, and the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin were among the most abundant proteins. GO term analysis of the top ten percent identified proteins based of LFQ values showed strong enrichment for GO terms related to ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 was independently confirmed using immunofluorescence analyses in K562 cells, HL60 cells, and primary non-transformed CD34+mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs) intra-nucleolar levels of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub were not increased in heat shocked cells versus untreated cells, suggesting that PcG proteins are not involved in Polycomb-mediated silencing of nucleolar chromatin nucleolar fractionations were performed on K562 cells (untreated, HS) samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in triplicates. GO analysis of overlapping proteins that were significantly enriched in the nucleolus after HS. classical nucelolar proteins like NPM1 and Fibrillarin are among the top enriched proteins in nucleoli. GO analysis of the top ten percent (based on LFQ value) of identified proteins shows enrichment for nucleolus-related processes like ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. \u00b0C) HL60 (A), K562 (B) and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs; C) showed changes in the nucleolar proteome in untreated and heat shocked K562 GFP-CBX8 cells. statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s t-test. independent LC-MS/MS analysis with K562 GFP-CBX8 cells confirmed these findings. HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of various chromatin regulators, protein chaperones and proteasomal subunits is a conserved biological phenomenon. HS alters polycomb complex binding and the epigenetic state at target genes. both PRC1 and PRC2 show strongly reduced chromatin binding after HS. both PRC1 and PRC2 show strongly reduced chromatin binding. heat shock induces loss of PRC1 and PRC2 binding to target genes. qPCR analyses of H2AK119ub levels at polycomb target genes in untreated and heat shocked (1 hr, 44\u00b0C) K562 cells. Error bars represent mean SD (n = 3 independent replicates, *p0.05 and ***p0.001). qPCR analyses of expression of polycomb target genes in wild type K562 cells. Error bars represent mean SD (n = 3 independent replicates, *p0.05 and **p0.01). HS causes displacement of PRC1/2 complexes vs. control cells. to assay HS-induced loss of PRC1 chromatin binding, we performed ChIP-seq of both endogenous CBX8 (K562 cells) and GFP-CBX2 (K562 GFP-CBX2 cells) in untreated cells or after HS. many CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 peaks were found to be intergenic. the increase in me1 levels argues that loss of epimarks is not a mere consequence of decreased nucleosome occupancy but truly a consequence of changes in the epigenetic marking of the chromatin. HS-induced loss of PRC1/2-associated epimarks also resulted in loss of silencing of Polycomb target genes. FRAP region is indicated in pre-bleach and transmission image. FRAP region is indicated in the pre-bleach and transmission image. ucleolar dynamics of GFP-CBX2 in heat shocked cells using FRAP/FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching) analysis revealed that there was very little fluorescence recovery in the bleached region and fluorescence loss in the adjacent nucleolar region. proteins in similar solid states have been shown to be aggregated (Patel et al., 2015) DNAJB1 and HSP70 were identified as part of the nucleolar proteome after heat shock (Figure 3H) to test the reversibility of nucleolar GFP-CBX2 accumulations after HS, we treated K562 GFP-CBX2 cells with a HS. within 3 hr after HS the GFP-CBX2 nucleolar accumulations dispersed and GFP-CBX2 regained its original pan-nu a partial knockdown of HSPA1A resulted in a significant delay of GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleoli in HEK293T GFP-CBX2 cells. HS is known to induce HSP expression (including several HSP70s), resulting in a period of increased thermotolerance. this cellular property allowed us to compare the kinetics of recovery of GFP-CBX2 after HS. thermotolerant cells that received a second HS showed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS. both HSP70 and DNAJB1 were strongly induced upon the first HS. EZH2 and CBX8 protein levels were rather stable or slightly reduced. cells are cultured at 37\u00b0C after HS (30 min, 44\u00b0C) in the presence of 5 M VER-155088 or DMSO. Error bars indicate the mean range calculated from independent microscopical images (n = 2; total cell number 50\u201390). in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells samples isolated at indicated time points according to panel D. Schematic representation of the effects of heat shock on polycomb proteins. refolding of polycomb proteins leads to refolding of polycomb proteins. Western analysis of HEK293T GFP-CBX2 cells, transfected with control or HSP70 siRNAs, both untreated and 3 hr after HS (30\u2019, 44\u00b0C), using HSPA1A/HSP70 and GAPDH antibodies. HS-induced epigenetic changes are reversible. IP-seq experiments in K562 and K562 wild-type cells showed that GFP-CBX2 target genes overlapped with endogenous CBX2 target genes and H2AK119ub enriched genes. HS-induced relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to nucleoli was confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses using antibodies against nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin. cleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 were both dependent on the duration and temperature of the HS. cells exposed to a temperature of 42\u00b0C also displayed nucleolar localization of GFP-CBX2 albeit with slower kinetics. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s t-test, **p0.01 and **p0.001. Statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s t-test, **p0.01 and ***p0.001. representative images of K562 GFP-CBX2 cell continuously exposed to 44\u00b0C and fixed at the indicated time points. HL60 cells stained with anti-CBX4 and anti-NPM1 stained with anti-CBX4 and anti-NPM1. the homology between these various CBX proteins is limited to the chromodomain (N-terminus) and Pc box (C-terminus) all generated truncated GFP-CBX fusion proteins displayed nucleolar localization after HS, suggesting the presence of the chromodomain is sufficient to induce nucleolar localization after HS. the kinetics of HS-induced relocalization of truncated CBX proteins were slightly slower, suggesting to analyze changes in the localization of endogenous PRC1 subunits, we isolated nucleoli from wild-type K562 cells. also here Fibrillarin was prominently found in the nucleolar fraction and beta-actin was confined to the cytoplasmic fraction. also endogenous RING1B levels were slightly elevated in the nucleolar fraction after HS. western blot analyses of cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleoli fractions from untreated and heat-shocked K562 cells stained with anti-Fibrillarin (FBL), anti-CBX4, anti-CBX8, anti-RING1B and anti-ACTIN antibodies. one of the most dramatic changes in heat treated nuclei is the swelling of nucleoli. in total, we identified 1279 proteins, and the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin were among the most abundant proteins. GO term analysis of the top ten percent identified proteins based on LFQ values showed strong enrichment for GO terms related to ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 was confirmed using western blot analysis on nucleolar fractions isolated from K562 or HL60 cells. HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 was independently confirmed using immunofluorescence analyses in K562 cells, HL60 cells, and primary non-transformed CD34+mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. HS induces strong shifts of various chromatin and transcription regulators toward the nucleolus. heat shock induces nucleolar accumulation of polycomb proteins, chromatin regulators and heat-shock proteins. nucleolar fractionations were performed on K562 cells (untreated, HS) LC-MS/MS analysis of isolated nucleoli shows enrichment for nucleolar proteins. GO analysis of top ten percent (based on LFQ value) of identified proteins shows enrichment for nucleolus-related processes like ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. o plot highlighting all (significantly) enriched proteasomal subunits. HS induces nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 in leukemic cells and primary human peripheral blood stem cells. HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of various chromatin regulators, protein chaperones and proteasomal subunits is a conserved biological phenomenon. independent LC-MS/MS analysis with K562 GFP-CBX8 cells confirmed these findings. HS showed a strong reduction in chromatin binding of GFP-CBX2, BMI1-GFP, MEL18-GFP and, to a lesser extent, GFP-RING1B. heat shock induces loss of PRC1 and PRC2 binding to target genes. ChIP-qPCR analyses of polycomb target genes using an antibody directed against endogenous EZH2 in untreated and heat shocked (1 hr, 44\u00b0C) K562 cells. Error bars represent mean SD (n = 3 independent replicates, *p0.05 and **p0.01 and***p0.001). qPCR analyses of expression of polycomb target genes in wild type K562 cells. n = 3 independent replicates, *p0.05 and **p0.01. qPCR analyses of expression of polycomb target genes in wild type K562 cells. heat maps and band plots of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 peaks clearly showed a loss of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 chromatin binding after HS. a strong decrease in H2AK119ub levels was also significantly reduced in heat-shocked cells vs. control cells. the increase in H3K4me1 levels argues that loss of epimarks is not a mere consequence of decreased nucleosome occupancy but truly a consequence of changes in the epigenetic marking of the chromatin. HS-induced loss of PRC1/2-associated epimarks also resulted in loss of silencing of Polycomb target genes. heat shock strongly immobilizes GFP-CBX2 in the nucleolus in a 1,6-hexanediol insensitive manner. FRAP region is indicated in the pre-bleach and transmission image. at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr in the presence or absence of 10% 1,6-hexanediol. the nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear body with liquid-like properties. its formation depends on liquid-liquid phase transition. there was very little fluorescence recovery in the bleached region. the co-appearance of HSPs in these nucleoli may be required to recover these regulators from their solid-like, aggregated state. some mammalian HSPs have been demonstrated to be able to disentangle protein aggregates (DNAJB1 and HSP70) that we identified as part of the nucleolar proteome after heat shock. hSP70 inhibition led to a clear delay in recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleoli. this suggests that the HSP70 machinery is not involved in chaperoning PcG proteins to the nucleolus after HS. however, a partial knockdown of HSPA1A resulted in a significant delay in GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleoli in HEK293T. thermotolerant cells that received a second HS showed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS. thermotolerant cells that received a second HS showed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS. cells are cultured at 37\u00b0C after HS (30 min, 44\u00b0C) in presence of 5 M VER-155088 or DMSO. Error bars indicate mean range calculated from independent microscopical images. Error bars represent mean range (n = 2, independent replicates, *p0.05 and **p0.01) Western blot analysis of H2AK119ub, H3K27me3, HSP70, DNAJB1, EZH2, CBX8 and -ACTIN levels in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells isolated at indicated time points according to panel D. HEK293T GFP-CBX2 recovery in control and HSP70 siRNA transfected HEK293T cells. Error bars indicate mean SD calculated from independent microscopical images. HS-induced epigenetic changes are reversible and recovery is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. a ncRNA, arising from intergenic stretches in between ribosomal DNA repeats, is capable of sequestering and immobilizing various proteins in the nucleolus upon acidosis. a ncRNA, arising from intergenic stretches in between ribosomal DNA repeats, is capable of sequestering and immobilizing various proteins in the nucleolus. the appearance of PcG proteins in the nucleolus was independent of the HSP70 machinery. a fraction of the nucleolar accumulated proteins are re-solubilized and functionally refolded. the nucleolus is a membrane-less organelle with liquid-like properties. a link between the proteasome and the nucleolus was previously suggested. proteasome inhibition leads to nucleolar accumulation of the proteasome. other types of stress have been shown to cause major changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus. lus has direct implications for histone marking and is not limited to H2AK119ub. lus also affects H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 levels at target genes. other studies have also shown HS-induced loss of H3K27Ac from HS-repressed enhancers. alterations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation are major contributors to aging-associated loss of cellular function. this may well trigger age- or disease-associated reduction in protein quality control of epigenetic regulators, including PcG proteins, leading to alterations in the epigenome. 0030 Cell line (H. sapiens) pRRL SFFV GFP-CBX2 van den Boom et al., 2016; PMID: 26748712 Lentivirally transduced in K562, HeLa and HEK293T, stable cell lines Transfected construct (H. sapiens) PC182 GFP-CBX4 Vandamme et al.
