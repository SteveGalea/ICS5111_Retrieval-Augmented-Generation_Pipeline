{"summary": "a number of EV71 outbreaks have been reported across the world. EV71 causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in children. a large scale EV71 outbreak associated with HFMD, neurological symdrome, and fatal cases was reported in china. emergence of EV71 infection has recently developed into a new threat to children. supportive therapy is still the primary management for severe cases of EV71 infection. the development of specific antiviral strategies against EV71 has become an urgent issue for the protection of children from the hazards of EV71 infection. viral RNA genome is not only the mRNA for viral protein translation, but it can also be the template for replication by the virus-encoded RNA polymerase (RdRP), designated 3D. the progeny positive-stranded viral RNA is then packaged by viral capsid proteins to form a new infectious virion. two molecules, pleconaril (Figure 1A) and pirodavir, were found to suppress rhinovirus replication by targeting the capsid protein [24-26] one of the molecules, pleconaril, has already been applied to treat life-threatening enterovirus infections [27]. pleconaril inhibition capacity of pleconaril could vary for different isolates of the virus. antivirals targeting enterovirus proteases 3Cpro and 2Apro Maturation cleavages are critical steps for EV71 protein synthesis. 2Apro and 3Cpro are key proteases for processing of the viral precursor polyprotein. rupintrivir was originally developed to inhibit human rhinovirus infection by blocking its 3Cpro activity [33-35] antivirals targeting the enterovirus RdRP complex could be a potent strategy for specifically inhibiting EV71 replication. a non-nucleoside analogue, DTriP-22, is a piperazine-containing pyrazolo derivative. aurintricarboxylic acid also exhibits the ability to inhibit EV71 3D polymerase. enviroxime was found as an anti-viral compound against the replication of rhinovirus and poliovirus. the viral protein 3A and its precursor 3AB play the key roles in formation of enterovirus replication complex [53,54] development of anti-vrials targeting on 3A or 3AB may be successful strategy for inhibiting EV71 replication. a recombinant murine IFN- was administered to EV71-infected newborn mice. in vitro testing also demonstrated the potency of IFN-14 in reducing EV71 replication. a recent study showed that EV71 2Apro could be an IFN antagonist. combination therapy could be a possible strategy to combat EV71. animal models for testing drugs against EV71 are urgently required. cynomolgus monkeys have been used to study neuropathogenicity of EV71. EV71 is a small non-enveloped virus that encloses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 7.4 kilobases. a phase I clinical trial in human has been conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a newly developed inactivated EV71 vaccine in china. the viral RNA genome is the mRNA for viral protein translation. it can also be the template for replication by the virus-encoded RNA polymerase (RdRP), designated 3D. the viral 2C protein, which is highly conserved among human enteroviruses, has been identified as part of the viral replication complex. the VP1 protein of poliovirus or rhinovirus has also been shown to form a canyon structure, which is important for receptor binding. the VP1 protein of poliovirus or rhinovirus has also been shown to form a canyon structure, which is important for receptor binding. lactoferrin was found to inhibit EV71 by binding to VP1 [31] lactoferrin is an abundant iron-binding glycoprotein in colostrum. antivirals targeting enterovirus proteases 3Cpro and 2Apro are critical steps for EV71 protein synthesis. riad EV71 2Apro could be predicted as His-21, Asp39, and Cys-110. antivirals targeting EV71 proteases should block viral protein maturation. aurintricarboxylic acid also exhibits the ability to inhibit EV71 3D polymerase. kaempferol has been shown to inhibit EV71 replication by changing the composition of the ITAFs. other small molecule antivirals targeting on EV71 replication Enviroxime was found as an anti-viral compound against the replication of rhinovirus and poliovirus. a recombinant murine IFN- was administered to EV71-infected newborn mice. in vitro testing also demonstrated the potency of IFN-14 in reducing EV71 replication. a recent study showed that EV71 2Apro could be an IFN antagonist. elucidation of mechanism of action of DTriP-22 was based on appearance of drug-resistant mutants and whole viral genome sequencing. combination therapy could be a possible strategy to combat EV71. animal models for testing drugs against EV71 are urgently required. the development of vaccine against EV71 Based on the experience in the control of poliovirus epidemic, vaccination should be a primary strategy to prevent EV71 infection in children. however, several researches have disclosed the availability for the vaccine against EV71. EV71 binds to its receptor on host cell and releases genomic RNA into cytoplasm. VP1-binding small molecules, such as pleconaril, can also interfere in virus entry. authors declare that they have no competing interests. pintrivir, Compound 1, and Ribavirin."}
