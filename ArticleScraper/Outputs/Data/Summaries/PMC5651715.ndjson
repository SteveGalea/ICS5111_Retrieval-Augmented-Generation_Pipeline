{"summary": "FMD virus (FMDV) is a highly variable virus with seven serotypes and multiple subtypes, each consisting of several antigenically distinct topotypes (3). many countries where FMD is endemic and countries that were previously affected but are now disease free practice prophylactic vaccination as a primary control measure by using vaccine antigens that match circulating viruses (6, 7). a drawback of LAVs is the reversion of the attenuating mutations via the same error-prone RdRp and adaptation pathways that provided the attenuated vaccine in first place. the inherently low fidelity of the viral RdRp thus presents a hurdle to the general use of this entire class of vaccines for RNA viruses. motif D, located immediately external to motif A, can also contribute to RdRp fidelity (21\u201323), as can coordinated protein dynamic networks involving residues quite distant from the active site. in vitro biochemistry experiments using purified 3Dpol suggested that a phenylalanine substitution would increase polymerase fidelity (HF) whereas isoleucine or leucine would reduce polymerase fidelity (LF) we selected residue Trp237, located within motif A, for mutagenesis. this is the structural equivalent of residue 230 in the coxsackievirus and poliovirus 3Dpol enzymes. the large tryptophan side chain was replaced with a slightly smaller phenylalanine (W237F) and much smaller leucine (W237L) and isoleucine (W237I) residues. discrimination factor 610 110 reflects a dCTP incorporation rate that is only 50-fold lower than the CTP incorporation rate. lowest discrimination factor, 400 60, was observed for the W237L mutant, which is significantly faster than the wild-type enzyme, with a single-nucleotide kpol value of 40 s1. sample data obtained with the 3Dpol W237F mutant show the changes in fluorescence at multiple CTP concentrations. kpol and Kd values were obtained by curve fitting. pA24W237LLF, and pA24W237LLF, were obtained by cloning synthetic DNA containing the desired mutation into pA24WT. the mutations were confirmed with recovered virus and were maintained following 10 passages in BHK-21 cells. one-step growth curves were performed in both stable cell lines and primary cells to identify any gross differences in growth kinetics. BHK-21 cells were infected at an MOI of 5 and incubated at 37\u00b0C or 39\u00b0C. progeny viruses were quantified at different times postinfection by a tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay at 37\u00b0C. to assess fidelity effects in an infectious-virus context, we first determined mutation frequencies following three passages in BHK-21 cells. fewer clones with no mutations and a higher proportion of clones have three and four mutations, consistent with these viruses being low-fidelity variants. the virus were grown in the presence of two different nucleoside analogs, ribavirin (0 to 500 M) and 5-fluorouracil (0 to 1,000 M), to determine whether altered fidelity manifests a differential response to mutagens. titers comparable to or slightly higher than those of the WT virus in the presence titer of the progeny was determined by a TCID50 assay after 24 h. values represent means standard deviation of data from two independent experiments. 3Dpol fidelity variant viruses retain fitness in the presence of the wild-type virus. fidelity mutations cause significant attenuation of FMDV in vivo. fidelity mutations cause significant attenuation of FMDV in vivo. all animals inoculated with the virus died by 2 days postinfection. viremia peaked 1 day after infection and was undetectable after day 3. the results provide evidence that both high- and low-fidelity 3Dpol mutations conferred significant in vivo attenuation. viremia based on serum samples collected from still-living animals on odd days after inoculation. the large tryptophan side chain was replaced with a slightly smaller phenylalanine (W237F) and much smaller leucine (W237L) and isoleucine (W237I) residues. an initial assessment of fidelity effects arising from these mutations was obtained by using a rapid stopped-flow kinetics-based nucleotide selectivity assay. the lowest discrimination factor, 400 60, was observed for the W237L mutant, which is significantly faster than the wild-type enzyme, with a single-nucleotide kpol value of 40 s1. overall, the dominant effects from mutation of W237 are on kpol values, which vary over 2- and 5-fold ranges for CTP and dCTP incorporation. sample data obtained with the 3Dpol W237F mutant show changes in fluorescence at multiple CTP concentrations. kpol and Kd values were obtained by curve fitting. one-step growth curves were performed in both stable cell lines and primary cells to identify any gross differences in growth kinetics. in BHK-21 cells, the three mutant viruses exhibited growth kinetics comparable to those of the WT virus at both 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C until 8 hpi. progeny viruses were quantified at different times postinfection by a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay at 37\u00b0C. mean titers standard deviations based on data from two independent experiments are shown. fidelity changes are apparent when data are further grouped into the number of isolates with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 mutations within the cloned VP3-VP1 fragment. ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. the virus yielded titers comparable to or slightly higher than those of the WT virus in the presence of both ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil. titer reductions of 2 to 3 logs at the highest mutagen doses tested within nontoxic ranges. titer of the progeny virus was determined by a TCID50 assay after 24 h. values represent means standard deviation of data from two independent experiments. 3Dpol fidelity variant viruses retain fitness in the presence of the wild-type virus. fidelity mutations cause significant attenuation of FMDV in vivo. we used a mouse model to examine the effect of 3Dpol fidelity mutations on in vivo FMDV virulence. 80 to 100% of the animals die within this period after inoculation with 105 PFU of FMDV A24 (26) two of the W237FHF virus- and one of the W237LLF virus-inoculated animals survived until the end of the 7-day study. viremia peaked 1 day after infection and was undetectable after day 3. both high- and low-fidelity 3Dpol mutations conferred significant in vivo attenuation. the classic methods for generating attenuated viruses are slow processes and not well suited for the rapid response that is critical for the control of an emerging FMDV outbreak. however, the classic methods for generating attenuated viruses are slow processes and not well suited for the rapid response that is critical for the control of an emerging FMDV outbreak. mutations at coxsackievirus 3Dpol residue 230 decreased fidelity, while the corresponding mutations in poliovirus 3Dpol increased fidelity. we targeted FMDV 3Dpol Trp237, the structural equivalent of Phe230, for mutagenesis followed by biochemical, mutagen tolerance, and animal infection studies. nonnative substrate is missing the NTP 2\u2032-hydroxyl group that plays a key role in recognizing a correctly base-paired NTP and triggering active-site closure for catalysis. a good correlation between virus-based mutation frequencies and in vitro biochemical discrimination between the CTP and 2\u2032-dCTP substrates (19, 20) ouracil, two nucleoside analogs that are commonly used to select for high-fidelity variant viruses. with both mutagens, the W237FHF virus exhibited subtly higher virus titers than those of the wild type. lower-fidelity W237ILF and W237LLF variants are more sensitive to the mutagens. these data directly show that increased or decreased polymerase fidelity can attenuate growth and limit disease. these findings reinforce previous conclusions that subtle palm domain movement for active-site closure allows viral RdRps to evolutionarily fine-tune their replication fidelity. these variant viruses have translational applications in the development of live attenuated vaccine strains, where controlling polymerase fidelity can be important. we can engineer mutations in the polymerase to enhance genetic stability through codon usage or, more powerfully, through amino acid selection. in our recent design of a high-fidelity motif D variant of coxsackievirus B3, we intentionally introduced a tryptophan residue as a stabilizing element. in this study, we removed a native tryptophan and replaced it with residues that retained function. all cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. FMDVs harboring phenylalanine, isoleucine, and leucine variants were designated A24 W237FHF, A24 W237ILF, and A24 W237LLF. mutated polymerases were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol and verified by DNA sequencing. the purification of polymerases was carried out as previously described for coxsackievirus polymerase (42). final reaction mixtures contained 25 nM elongation complex in a solution containing 75 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and 2 mM TCEP at 30\u00b0C. data were collected by using a MOS-500 spectrometer and detection via a brightline 370/36-nm-band-pass filter (Semrock, Inc.) a 1,295-bp fragment spanning the VP3-VP1 genes was amplified from the cDNA of each virus by using a standard Taq DNA polymerase kit. for each virus variant, 96 individual colonies were picked, and plasmid DNA was purified with a PerfectPrep Plasmid 96 Vac kit (5 Prime, USA) the mutation frequency was calculated as the total number of mutations identified per population divided by the total number of nucleotides sequenced the marked A24-silent strain was infected with a 1:1 mixture of genomes. one-tenth of the total material was added to new cells for 48 h. the procedure was repeated a third time for each of the four virus competition combinations. the ratios of mutant to reference virus densities in the initial inoculation mixture and at t days postinoculation were 0.997. no significant difference in fitness arose from the silent mutations engineered into the reference virus. PK cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. all cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the 3Dpol variants were produced in a full-length infectious clone derivative of the virulent A24 Cruzeiro strain (40) a synthetic codon-optimized gene for the FMDV A24 WT polymerase with a C-terminal GSSS-6His tag was outsourced (GenScript Inc., Piscataway, NJ) and subsequently cloned into a pET-26b-Ub vector for mutagenesis and expression (41) the purification of polymerases was carried out as previously described for coxsackievirus polymerase (42). elongation complexes were diluted 100-fold, i.e., to 50 nM RNA, for stopped-flow kinetics experiments. final mixtures contained 25 nM elongation complexes in a solution containing 75 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES and 2 mM TCEP at 30\u00b0C. dCTP discrimination are a good proxy for changes in the fidelity of replication of infectious virus resulting from mutations within motif A (19). the exact fold changes in the discrimination factor cannot be directly translated into corresponding fold changes in polymerase fidelity measured by nucleotide misincorporation frequencies. the relative fitness of the fidelity mutant viruses was determined in coinfection experiments by using equimolar amounts of the individual variants and the marked A24-silent strain. the fidelity mutant viruses were infected at an MOI of 0.01 by using a 1:1 mixture of genomes, grown for 48 h, and freeze-thawed. the relative fitness of each virus was determined based on the formula W = [R(t)/R(0)]1/t to represent the fitness, W, of a mutant genotype relative to the common competitor reference sequence. the ratio of the fitness of the normal WT virus to that of the reference virus was 0.997. no significant difference in fitness arose from the silent mutations engineered into the reference virus. Viremia was determined by a plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. were monitored for 7 days, and serum was collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7."}
