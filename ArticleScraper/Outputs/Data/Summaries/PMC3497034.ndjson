{"summary": "the 31 patients (25 primary, six secondary infections) developed severe disease that progressed to a fatal outcome in seven of the cases. the source of infection was traced back to african green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) that had been shipped to all three locations. MARV was identified as the causative agent of the disease. in the following years from 1975 through 1985, only sporadic outbreaks that affected small numbers of individuals were caused by MARV on the African continent. MARV was long thought to be less threatening (Table 1). the genomes of the angolan isolates differ about 7% at nucleotide level from the majority of the East African MARV isolates. there is no evidence so far that the observed genetic differences result in higher virulence in humans. t U\u201d (MARV \u201cU\u201d) [16] Laboratory infection:Unspecified violation of safety requirements 1998-2000 Durba, Watsa (multiple indepen-dent, but simultan-eous or over-lapping outbreaks) Democratic Republic of the Congo Durba, Democratic Republic of the Congo. unknown 2007 Kam-wenge Uganda Kamwenge District, Uganda/ Gold mining in Kitaka Cave 1/4 (25%) MARV-01Uga 2007, RAVV- 02Uga 2007 [19] 2008 Colorado, City unreported USA Uganda/ 0/1 (0%) - [17] MARV Leiden [18] Visit of Python Cave in maramagambo forest Total: 368/452 (81%) The viral genomes showed a remarkably high genetic stability within this outbreak. a Dutch woman succumbed to the infection after her return to the Netherlands. the american tourist developed mild symptoms and survived. in the nearby kitaka mine in the Kamwenge district of Uganda, gold mining activity resulted in four cases of MARV infection in 2007. phylogenetic analysis of full-length MARV genomes from humans and bats. number at the nodes represent posterior probability values. MARV isolates obtained from bats are shown in red. MARV was isolated from healthy infected R. aegyptiacus bats caught in Uganda. the bats were collected in kitaka cave around the same time as human infections occurred that had been linked to the cave. MARV sequences were closely related to the distinct isolates that had been reported during these outbreaks in humans. genus marburgvirus includes a single species, marburg marburgvirus. phylogenetic analysis based on genomic sequence data suggests that the known members of this species can be assigned to at least five different lineages of which four are very closely related. the fifth is divergent (a nucleotide difference of 21%). MVD has an incubation period ranging from 3 to 21 days (typically 5 to 10 days), which is likely modulated by factors such as infectious dose and possibly by route of infection. onset of illness begins with generic flu-like symptoms; a characteristic high fever (typically 39\u201340 oC), severe headache, chills, myalgia, prostration, and malaise. many of the initial symptoms may persist in the early organ phase, and patients may sustain a high fever. they may also display neurological symptoms including encephalitis, confusion, delirium, irritability, and aggression. patients can also develop dyspnea and abnormal vascular permeability. MVD has an incubation period ranging from 3 to 21 days (typically 5 to 10 days), which is likely modulated by factors such as infectious dose and possibly by route of infection. the course of MVD has conventionally been broken down into three phases [45]: an initial generalization phase, an early organ phase, or either a late organ phase depending upon disease outcome. more than 75% of patients present with some form of clear hemorrhagic manifestation such as petechiae, mucosal bleeding, melena, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis, and ecchymoses. at this stage, multiple organs are affected including the pancreas, kidney, and liver. at this stage, multiple organs are affected including the pancreas, kidney, and liver. strict quarantine procedures have so far prevented infections acquired by imported NHPs into non-endemic countries. the prevention and control of outbreaks and infections in endemic countries is much more challenging. the main focus of outbreak control is the prevention of secondary transmission and further primary infections. fast progression and high lethality rates associated with MVD even after hospital admission resulted in a high level of fear and suspicion by the resident population. the fact that health care workers wearing recommended personal protective equipment were fully masked and not identifiable further increased anxiety. this resulted in the hiding of infected family members and verbal and in some cases physical aggression towards members of aid organizations. the ward for confirmed MARV patients is on the left. the solid plastic sheeting used for the outer wall is shown in the distance. the ward for confirmed MARV patients is on the left. MARV particles are surrounded by a host-derived membrane that is coated with spikes of 5-10 nm in length. the central core of the viral particles is the ribonucleoprotein complex (nucleocapsid) formed by the viral RNA genome and tightly associated nucleocapsid proteins. egmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA genomes of various MARV isolates range in size from 19,111 to 19,114 nts. each gene is composed of a highly conserved transcription start and stop signal, an unusually long 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 untranslated region, and the open reading frame (ORF) the genes are either separated by short intergenic regions that range from 4 to 97 nts, or the transcription stop signal of the upstream gene overlap, sharing five the UN(5) hexamers are located within the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the first MARV gene, the NP gene, and are separated from the first promoter region by the 12 nts long transcription start signal. substitutions in the NP transcription start signal do not affect replication activity but do interfere with transcription initiation. antagonist VP40 303 38 kDa budding, antagonist of IFN signaling GP 681 170-200 kDa attachment, receptor binding, fusion, tetherin antagonist VP30 281 28 kDa nucleocapsid formation VP24 253 24 kDa catalytic domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 7.3.1. GP is a type I transmembrane protein which is inserted into the viral envelope in the GP is cleaved at amino acid 435 by furin or a furin-like protease in the trans Golgi network, resulting in two disulfide-linked subunits, GP1 (160 kD) and GP2 (38 kD) the transmembrane subunit GP2 contains the fusion peptide and is presumed to mediate fusion of the viral and the cellular membrane based on similarity to EB GP subverts innate immune responses but also suppresses adaptive immune response. a 17-mer peptide corresponding to the putative immunosuppressive domain of MARV GP was shown to induce lymphocyte death and suppression of cytokine responses. it is not yet known if this motif plays a role in induction of lymphocyte apoptosis observed in MARV infection. VP40 coats the inner side of the virion\u2019s membrane. it can be easily removed from the nucleocapsid by salt dissociation. VP40 accumulates in membranous structures of the late endosomal compartment. little is known about the structure of MARV VP40. VP40 is phosphorylated at several tyrosine residues located in the N-terminal region of the protein. VP40 also possesses a PPPY late domain motif in its amino terminus. MARV VP40 blocks phosphorylation of Janus kinases, which play an important role in multiple signaling pathways by phosphorylating and activating STAT proteins. in MARV-infected cells treated with exogenous stimuli, Janus kinases were also not phosphorylated and VP40 was identified as the viral protein inhibiting IFN signaling. EBOV VP24 interacts with STAT1 and members of the nuclear importin family. VP24 is generally addressed as a second, minor matrix protein. but cryo-electron tomography analysis showed that VP24 is located close to the nucleocapsid proteins. MARV VP24 is involved in the maturation of transport-competent nucleocapsids. it mediates the interaction between nucleocapsids and budding sites at the plasma membrane. it has been shown that it forms oligomers, preferentially tetramers. NP is expressed in the absence of other nucleocapsid proteins. it self-assembles into highly organized helical tubular structures. it forms interactions with most of the other viral proteins, leading to subcellular redistribution of these proteins. VP35 is tightly associated with NP and serves as a bridging protein between nucleocapsid complex and L. VP35 forms homo-oligomers mediated by a coiled-coil motif located in the N-terminal part of the protein. expression of MARV VP35 in absence of other viral proteins was sufficient to completely block the induction of type I IFN in stimulated human dendritic cells. EBOV VP35 is a dsRNA binding protein and interferes with RNA silencing pathways. MARV and EBOV VP30 proteins show many structural similarities. MARV VP30 is not essential for transcription or replication activity in a MARV minigenome system. down-regulation of VP30 by RNA interference in MARV-infected cells led to the reduction of both viral protein synthesis and virion production. only members of the subfamily Pneumovirinae possess a protein similar to VP30, M2-1, which functions as a transcription processivity factor. marburg virions are pleomorphic particles, which appear as rod- or ring-like, crook- or six-shaped, or branched structures. the same study revealed a mean particle length of 892 nm and a mean diameter of 91 nm. MARV particles are considerably shorter than EBOV virions. the nucleocapsids are highly organized tubular structures with an outer diameter of 45-50 nm and an electron-dense central axis of 19-25 nm. the central axis is surrounded by a helical capsid with cross-striations at a 5 nm interval. the MARV nucleocapsids form a left-handed helix with a pitch of 7.5 nm and a flexible average upstream gene and the transcription start signal of the downstream gene overlap, sharing five highly conserved nts. the structure of this gene overlap is found among all filoviruses. the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 genome ends are extracistronic regulatory regions that contain cis-acting signals essential for transcription and replication. the structure of the MARV antigenomic promoter has not yet been determined. a common feature of the leader and trailer regions of all NNS RNA viruses is a high degree of complementarity of the 10-15 most terminal 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 nucleotides. the MARV genome encodes seven structural proteins listed in Table 2. GP is a type I transmembrane protein which is inserted into the viral envelope in the form of homotrimeric spikes. ebolaviruses use transcriptional editing to express the membrane-bound GP and at least two nonstructural glycoproteins. GP is heavily glycosylated by complex and high mannose-type glycans as well as by mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides. ane subunit GP2 contains the fusion peptide and is presumed to mediate fusion of the viral and the cellular membrane based on similarity to EBOV GP2. the cytoplasmic tail of GP2 is involved in enhancing the efficiency of viral entry by maintaining the structure of the ectodomain. it has been reported for MARV that considerable amounts of GP shed from infected cells. it is not yet known if this motif plays a role in induction of lymphocyte death. it has been suggested that shedding of the ectodomain of membrane-bound EBOV GP by tumor necrosis factor -converting enzyme may play a role in blocking the activity of neutralizing antibodies during infection. MARV VP40 is the major factor in particle formation and budding. expression of VP40 in the absence of other viral proteins leads to the formation and release of filamentous virus-like particles (VLPs) resembling authentic virions. EBOV VP40 is phosphorylated at several tyrosine residues located in the N-terminal region of the protein. a non-phosphorylatable mutant of VP40 is impaired in its ability to recruit nucleocapsids to the sites of budding. VP40 also possesses a PPPY late domain motif in its amino terminus. other motifs and single amino acids have been found to be important for particle release. EBOV VP24 blocks nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT proteins by binding to STAT1 and importins involved in the nucle transport of specific STAT proteins. MARV VP40 inhibits phosphorylation of Janus kinases and STAT proteins. VP24 can easily be released from virion-associated nucleocapsids by treatment with increasing salt concentrations. a minor part of the protein (approx. 10%) is weakly bound to cellular membranes, including filopodia enriched with VP40. co-expression of NP and VP24 is sufficient to direct VP24 to NP inclusions in the cytoplasm. MARV nucleocapsid proteins NP, VP35, VP30 and L encapsidated by nucleocapsid proteins. nucleoprotein NP enwraps the genomic and antigenomic RNAs. NP self-assembles into highly organized helical tubular structures. NP is expressed in the absence of other nucleocapsid proteins. strong binding of NP to nucleocapsid proteins VP35 and VP30 redirects both proteins into NP-derived inclusions. a bipartite coiled-coil motif in central part of NP has been shown to play an important role for self-assembly and NP-VP35 interaction. NP contains a C-terminal late domain motif, PSAP, which has been shown to be required for budding. VP35 forms homo-oligomers mediated by a coiled-coil motif located in the N-terminal part of the protein. VP35 shares many features with the phospho (P) proteins of other NNS RNA viruses. VP35 is either not or only very weakly phosphorylated. MARV and EBOV VP30 proteins show many structural similarities. both are highly phosphorylated at N-terminally located serine and threonine residues. phosphorylation is crucial for their interaction with NP. the MARV polymerase complex, L, has an estimated molecular weight of 267 kD. it is essential for transcription and replication and together with VP35 forms the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. the binding site for VP35 has been mapped to the N-terminal 530 amino acid residues of L. GP is heavily glycosylated by complex and high mannose-type N-linked glycans as well as by mucin-type O-linked glycans. the protein contributes about 50% of the apparent molecular weight of the protein. the precursor GP is cleaved at amino acid 435 by furin or a furin-like protease in the trans Golgi network. tetherin was shown to block release of VP40-induced virus-like MARV and EBOV particles. co-expression of GP was sufficient to counteract antiviral activity of tetherin by a yet unknown mechanism. it is possible that GP subverts innate immune responses but also suppresses the adaptive immune response. VP40 plays a major role in the formation of virions by redistributing nucleocapsids from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane, recruiting GP to the sites of budding. overexpression of VP40 led to reduced reporter gene expression of MARV minigenomes, suggesting a regulatory role of VP40 in transcription and/or replication. MARV VP40 is phosphorylated at several tyrosine residues located in the N-terminal region of the protein. a mutant of VP40 is impaired in its ability to recruit nucleocapsids to the sites of budding. MARV VP40 blocks the phosphorylation of Janus kinases, which play an important role in multiple signaling pathways by phosphorylating and activating STAT proteins. it is believed that Jak1 is the target for VP40, but the mechanism of VP40-induced inhibition is not completely understood. EBOV VP24 blocks the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT proteins by binding to STAT1. MARV VP40 inhibits phosphorylation of Janus kinases and STAT proteins in response to type I and II IFNs and IL6. EBOV VP24 interacts with STAT1 and members of the nuclear importin family and prevents nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1. functional studies on MARV VP24 suggest that the protein is important for the release of viral particles in the context of infection. RNAi-mediated knockdown of VP24 in MARV-infected cells had no impact on viral genome replication. VP24 is involved in a step after replication and before budding sites at the plasma membrane. nucleoprotein NP enwraps the genomic and antigenomic RNAs. NP self-assembles into highly organized helical tubular structures. it forms interactions with most of the other viral proteins, leading to subcellular redistribution. NP recruits Tsg101, a component of the ESCRT I complex, through its late domain motif, leading to enhanced VP40-induced budding. NP is heavily phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues clustered in seven regions in the C-terminal part of the protein. the impact of EBOV VP35 on the host\u2019s antiviral response has been intensively investigated. MARV VP35 blocked reporter gene expression as efficiently as EBOV VP35. expression of MARV VP35 in the absence of other viral proteins was sufficient to completely block the induction of type I IFN. EBOV VP30 forms hexamers [151,152], binds single-stranded RNA [153], and interacts with L [154]. however, similar data for MARV VP30 are not available. MARV VP30 plays an important role in viral amplification. the L proteins of the NNS RNA viruses are highly conserved multifunctional proteins. MARV L is believed to carry out RNA synthesis, capping, and polyadenylation of viral mRNAs. most of the studies characterizing the MARV replication cycle have utilized recombinant systems. MARV attaches to target cells via interaction with cell surface molecules. GP1 is cleaved by endosomal proteases (3) facilitating binding to NPC1. mRNA is subsequently translated by the host cell machinery (7). surface proteins have also been implicated in facilitating MARV entry. however, the ability of MARV to infect cells lacking these receptors indicates that there might be redundancy in cellular molecules required for MARV attachment to cells. a number of key residues of EBOV GP that are involved in virion incorporation and GP-mediated entry have been identified. canonical caveolae- and clathrin-mediated mechanisms are unlikely to be the primary mechanism of MARV entry due to steric issues. the typical MARV particle size (average 790 nm) is much larger than canonical caveolae (50\u2013100 nm) or clathrin-coated pits (up to 200 nm) whereas pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (100 100 nm) and vesi studies examining the roles of endosomal proteases on the entry of MARV and EBOV have produced mixed results. recombinant VSV expressing EBOV GP indicate a primary role for Cathepsin B (CatB) and minor role for Cathepsin L (CatL) GP1 cleavage by endosomal proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains. the membrane-bound fusogenic GP2 undergoes a low pH-dependent rearrangement to an extended conformation resulting in the fusion of virion and endo-lysosomal membranes. encapsidated negative-sense RNA genome is transcribed resulting in seven monocistronic mRNAs by the viral polymerase. the encapsidated negative-sense RNA genome is transcribed resulting in seven monocistronic mRNAs by the viral polymerase. the antigenomes are encapsidated by the nucleocapsid proteins and are in turn used as templates for genome synthesis. MARV exploits the vesicular transport machinery of the infected cell for viral egress. the vesicular transport system is used by VP40 for its intracellular trafficking to the multivesicular bodies. cellular proteins that promote particle release are linked to the ESCRT machinery. filamentous MARV from cultured cells peaked at 1\u20132 days post infection. most of the cells were vesiculated, the released virions were round or bent. the pointed tip of the budding nucleocapsids is oriented towards the membrane, indicating that MARV budding is directional. transcription of GP takes place at the ER and undergoes multiple posttranslational modifications on its way through the classical secretory pathway (8). positive sense antigenomes are synthesized from the incoming viral genomes (9) GP is transported to multivesicular bodies (MVB) and to the cell membrane where budding takes place (11). endocytosis Following attachment, marburg virions undergo endocytosis mediated through a mechanism that currently remains undetermined. initial studies investigating caveolin-mediated endocytosis showed that depletion of host cell cholesterol reduced viral infectivity but presented no direct evidence of caveolae involvement. the caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways for virus entry may therefore be the result of the artificial nature of the pseudotyped virions. none of these analyses examined the role of this pathway during MARV entry, but it remains an intriguing possibility given the cholesterol-dependence. catB and catL inhibitors greatly reduced EBOV infection but showed mixed results with MARV. but two other, more recent analyses determined that CatB was not required for MARV entry. catalytic activity is not required for EBOV infection indicating specific binding to NPC1 rather than its role in cholesterol transport is required. a low pH-dependent rearrangement to an extended conformation prevented entry of a MARV GP-pseudotyped virus. a recent report with live MARV showed that ammonium chloride inhibited entry and replication, but that Bafilomycin A1 specifically inhibits vacuolar-type H(+) ATPase. there is convincing evidence that initial virus attachment at the cell surface can occur via the binding of GP carbohydrates to various cellular C- marburg virions undergo endocytosis mediated through a mechanism that currently remains undetermined. initial studies investigating caveolin-mediated endocytosis showed that depletion of host cell cholesterol reduced viral infectivity but presented no direct evidence of caveolae involvement. matitis virus (VSV) (70 180 nm) are not [173]. findings indicate that involvement of the caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways for virus entry may therefore be the result of the artificial nature of the pseudotyped virions. catB and catL inhibitors greatly reduced EBOV infection but showed mixed results with MARV. but two other, more recent analyses determined that CatB was not required for MARV entry. other endosomal proteases may also be able to facilitate GP1 activation via cleavage. the membrane-bound fusogenic GP2 undergoes a low pH-dependent rearrangement to an extended conformation resulting in the fusion of virion and endo-lysosomal membranes. a recent report with live MARV showed that ammonium chloride inhibited entry and replication, but that Bafilomycin A1 specifically inhibits vacuolar-type H(+) ATPase and prevents re-acidification of vesicles of antigenomes are encapsidated by nucleocapsid proteins. NP, VP35, L, and probably VP30 are needed for viral transcription. it is hypothesized that negative regulators of replication convert the active polymerase complex into an inactive state. MARV particles are preferentially released at filopodia, filamentous cellular protrusions. filopodia are used by cells to explore the extracellular environment. it is believed that viral particles can bud directly into adjacent cells. cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, are early target cells of MARV. MARV replication was observed as early as 24 hours post infection in macrophages of infected guinea pigs. infected monocytes have been found in cynomolgus macaques at 2 days post infection. endothelial cells are late target cells during MARV infection in multiple tissues. only low numbers of infected endothelial cells are observed in NHP infection. despite high viral load and necrotic lesions only minor inflammation is observed in infected tissues and organs. increased levels of TNF have been observed in infected rhesus macaques and mice. no increase was observed in infected cynomolgus macaques [14]. increased survival of MARV-infected guinea pigs treated with anti-TNF antibodies suggests that TNF indeed plays an important role in MVD pathogenesis. contradictory data have been reported for the NHP model. one study reported elevated IL1 levels in final disease stages. no change was observed in another study of infected NHPs. pDCs in the spleen were identified as the major source of secreted IFN in MARV infected NHPs. but secretion most likely occurs from non-infected cells [193]. pDCs are not productively infected due to impairment of viral entry. MARV variants Musoke and Ci67 and RAVV variant Ravn were adapted to severe-combined immunodeficiency mice by serial passaging. successful adaptation by serial passaging was also used to generate lethal infection models for both guinea pig and hamster [206,208] 75 nucleotide changes were observed during adaptation of RAVV Ravn. 33 changes for MARV Ci67 were described, with most amino acid changes occurring in VP40. the only amino acid exchange detected in both the mouse- and guinea pig-adapted MARV is VP40. real-time RT-PCR in the field was successfully proven during the MARV outbreak in Uge, angola. RT loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has the potential to significantly improve field diagnosis of MARV infections. successful protection of rodents did not always mean protection of NHPs. a codon-optimized DNA vaccine elicited a strong antibody response. a poor induction of virus-specific antibodies was observed using a DNA vaccine. a vaccine based on the VEEV replicon system expressing either MARV GP and NP alone completely protected guinea pigs and NHPs. a single immunization with recombinant VSV expressing MARV Musoke GP resulted in 100% protection of cynomolgus macaques challenged by intramuscular injection or aerosol exposure. only low levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in NHPs vaccinated with recombinant MARV GP. a third of EBOV-infected NHPs survived, however, following treatment with recombinant nematode coagulant protein 2. a small molecule inhibitor showed complete protection of MARV-infected mice when administered 24h after infection."}
