{"summary": "114 of 1,135 sera from 12 of 16 bat species sampled between 2005 and 2009 in 4/5 countries reacted with recombinant CCHFV GP antigen. CCHFV seropositivity was significantly elevated for bat species that roost in caves versus those that roost in trees. no antibodies were found in (n = 43) sera from new world bats, corresponding to the notion that CCHFV is an Old World virus2. CCHFV-GP CCHFV-based neutralization test for CCHFV antibodies on bat serum samples from five countries accumulated in the years 2003 to 2011.

CCHF VLPs were infected with serum-treated VLPs for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. at 24 h post infection, luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the DLA kit. a reduction 80% of the normalized Renilla luciferase activity was considered a significant VLP neutralizing activity. a convalescent mouse-anti CCHFV reference serum (+) was used as a positive control. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments. NT can prove previous infection with CCHFV because there is no cross-neutralization between serogroups31. NTs require relatively large volumes of serum that cannot be obtained from most bat species, only for 30 of the 114 IIFT-positive sera covering 10/12 bat species, NT assays could be performed. CCHFV IIFT negative sera was used as positive control (+) for 7 of 11 CCHF VLP-positive sera, enough material was available to conduct additional neutralization tests by a full virus CCHFV neutralization test. sera were thus titrated in 2-fold serial dilutions in a range of 1:40\u20131:1,280. arbitrary reduction of 80% of Renilla luciferase activity was rated positive. CCHFV serum antibody titer at 90% FFU reduction using a starting dilution of 1:40. lack of evidence for CCHFV-related nucleotide sequences in serum samples. the endpoint RT-PCR detection limit of an RT-PCR formulation was between 8 and 80 copies per reaction. an additional RT-PCR assay was developed based on a hemi-nested formulation using primers described in Honig et al.28 followed by a 2nd round RT-PCR step with novel primers. IIFT-positive detections were predominantly identified in cave-dwelling, migratory bats including the frugivorous species Rousettus aegyptiacus (24.4%; 48/197) and the insectivorous species Coleura afra (42.9%; 6/14), Hipposideros cf. caffer (6.3%; 3/48), Miniopterus inflatus (17.6%; 9/51) and Hipposideros gigas Foliage-living bats Artibeus jamaicensis Panama BCI 2011 F N 0/15 (0.0) ND ND Eidolon helvum Ghana Kumasi Zoo 2009 F Y 1/96 (1.0) 0/1 (0.0) ND 2010 0/71 (0.0) ND ND Epomops franqueti Gabon Lepaka 2008 F Y 2/44 (4.5) 0/2 (0.0) ND Congo Lebango ND Myonycteris torquata Congo Lebango 2006 F Y 3/91 (3.3) 0/3 (0.0) ND Mbomo 2006 0/9 (0.0) ND Cave-dwelling bats Coleura afra Gabon Batouala 2009 I Y 5/12 (41.7) 2/3 (66.6) 1/1 (100.0) Faucon 2009 1/2 (50.0) 1/1 (100.0) ND Zadie 2009 0/12 (0.0) f 2009 1/18 (5.6) ND ND Wunstorf 2003 0/3 (0.0) ND ND Nyctalus noctula Germany Bodenholz 2009 0/3 (0.0) ND ND Mine 2009 0/15 (0.0) ND Rousettus aegyptiacus Gabon Batouala 2009 F Y 8/15 (53.3) ND Hopital 2005 1/60 (1.7) ND Keri 2005 4/18 (22.2) ND Lob samples were analyzed for CCHFV glycoprotein (GP)-reactive antibodies. secondary detection was performed with goat-anti bat immunoglobulin G (IgG, 1:1,000) followed by DyLight488\u2013labeled donkey-anti goat Ig (1:100). gray bars represent frugivorous bat species whereas black bars show insectivorous bat species. CCHFV GP-based indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) and a CCHF virus-like particle (VLP)-based neutralization test (NT). CCHF VLPs were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with antisera at a final dilution of 1:100. number 31\u201340 shows CCHFV IIFT negative sera: 31 (Coleura afra), 32 (Epomops franqueti), 33 (Eidolon helvum), 34 (Hipposideros cf. caffer), 35 (Hipposideros cf. caffer), 13\u201316 (Hipposideros gigas), 17 (Hipposideros gigas), 18\u201321 (Miniopterus inflatus), 22\u201326 all 40 (30 IIFT-positive, 10 IIFT-negative) bat sera were tested in a Rift Valley fever (RVF) VLP-based NT32. a reduction 80% of the specific luciferase activity (dashed line) was considered as VLP neutralisation. sera were thus titrated in 2-fold serial dilutions in a range of 1:40\u20131:1,280. the test confirmed full virus neutralizing activity in 5 of 7 sera. arbitrary reduction of 80% of Renilla luciferase activity was rated positive. CCHFV serum antibody titer at 90% FFU reduction using a starting dilution of 1:40. scarcity of bat serum samples did not allow to test lower serum dilutions. n = 15, both from panama and myotis dasycneme were not available for RT-PCR testing due to sample volume limitations. in the remaining 1,067 of 1,135 serologically-tested sera, no CCHFV RNA was found by both RT-PCR formulations. in the remaining 1,067 of 1,135 serologically-tested sera, no CCHFV RNA was found by both formulations. viremia can be very short (6 days)37. the chances to detect CCHFV RNA in bat samples may be very limited. previous studies have shown that the detection frequency of viral RNA is generally very low (3%)17,19. NSDV serogroup contains NSDV (also named Ganjam virus) and Dugbe virus whose serological classification in one serogroup was again based on cross-reactivity in CFA and IIFT31. NT enables further serological discrimination between taxa in serogroups. these taxa might be referred to as two different serotypes within the NSDV serogroup. african bat species have been infected with CCHFV or a closely related nairovirus in the same serogroup. the identification of high neutralizing antibody titers indicates that bats experience infections followed by seroconversion. CCHFV might thus exemplify another highly pathogenic agent that is effectively controlled in bats. soft ticks are long-lived and blood meals of soft ticks take only a short period of time (minutes to hours)53. the low rate of viremia in bats points to a persistence of the virus in ticks rather than bats. indirect immunofluorescence test CCHFV antibody detection was performed by a modified, commercial, indirect IIFT (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) dilution involved goat-anti bat IgG (Bethyl, Montgomery, AL, USA) diluted 1:1,000 and Dylight488 labeled donkey-anti goat IgG (1:100) a pGL3-Firefly construct was applied as transfection control. serum-treated VLPs were infected for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. at 24 h post infection, luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates using the dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. amplification of CCHFV RNA was identified using oligonucleotide combinations Nairo-F (ATG ATT GC5 AAY AG5 AAY TTY AA) and Nairo-R (ACA GCA RTG 5AT 5GG 5CC CCA YTT, 1st round) and cc1a-c-F (GTG CCA CTG ATG ATG CAC AAA AGG ATT CCA TCT) and Nairo- only bat species with a positive CCHFV-IIFT result were included.
