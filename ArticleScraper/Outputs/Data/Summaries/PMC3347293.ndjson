{"summary": "bats represent approximately one-fifth of 5,676 recognized species of mammals. rabies virus and related lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (4, 8, 15, 25, 28). study of more than 2,000 mammals, principally small rodents, in Trinidad failed to provide serological evidence of infection with TCRV. this is unusual in that all other arenaviruses with known hosts are rodent borne (12, 16) previous experimental infections of rodents in the 1970s and 1980s found that TCRV was lethal to newborn mice, causing paralysis and necrosis in the central nervous system. the bat colony has neotropical fruit bats of two species, Carollia perspicillata and A. jamaicensis. they are maintained together in a 36-m3 room that allows unrestrained free flight. the colony has been closed for 16 years and is rabies virus free. the titer of virus stock was 107 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) per ml of BA1 medium (MEM, 1% bovine serum albumin, 350 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate, 50 ml/liter 1 M Tris [pH 7.6], 5 mg/liter phenol red) for the initial experiment, each of 12 male bats were inoculated with 100 l containing 106 TCID50 subcutaneously (s.c. sterile PBS i.n. group 3 consisted of two bats that received 106 TCID50 s.c. in the abdomen and one that received sterile PBS s.c. in its abdominal wall. the fourth group consisted of two bats that received 104 TCID50 s.c. in the abdomen and one that received sterile PBS s.c. in its abdominal wall. l of blood was collected from each bat each time and placed into 200 l of BA1 medium containing 5% FBS. serum samples were used for virus isolation attempts and neutralizing-antibody tests. RNA from oral swabs, rectal swabs, and organ samples was reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA synthesis kits. amplification was performed using 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. plasmids were purified using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) the plasmids were then incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight in 4 ml of LB broth. the cells were kept at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 days. terminal serum samples from each bat were screened for anti-TCRV neutralizing antibody and by immunofluorescence. a log2 dilution series was prepared for each sample without the addition of serum to serve as an anti-TCRV positive control. l containing 4 105 Vero E6 cells was added to each well. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 days. the cells were then screened for the presence of TCRV. each infection experiment, bats were placed three to a cage in four cages. water was made available in bowls inside each cage, and individual bats were identified using numbered wing tags. group 1 consisted of two bats that received 106 TCID50 i.n. and one bat that received sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) i.n. group 3 consisted of two bats that received 106 TCID50 i.n. and one bat that received sterile PBS i.n. swabs were collected from each bat every 2 days to test for virus shedding. the oral and rectal swabs were collected in 500 l of BA1 medium containing 5% FBS. the samples were then frozen at 80\u00b0C until they were processed. RNA was extracted from bat organ samples collected in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) the organ samples were placed in 1.5-ml screw-cap tubes, and approximately 12 2.3-mm zirconia/silica beads were added to each tube. RNA samples were frozen at 80\u00b0C until they were used for reverse transcription. PCR products were cloned into the TOPO-TA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cloning vector according to manufacturer's directions. the clones were then used to transform one Shot chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) that were subsequently plated and grown on LB-ampicillin plates. the cells were incubated with 100 l of virus dilutions for 24 h. 200 l of fresh medium was added to replace the old medium. the cells were kept at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 days. dilution series with mouse anti-TCRV ascites fluid in cell culture medium was done without the addition of serum to serve as an anti-TCRV positive control. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and 50 l containing 4 105 cells was then added to each well. the cells were then screened for the presence of TCRV using immunofluorescence. on day 18 p.i., a bat was found dead, and the last bat was moribund and was euthanized. signs in moribund bats included poor responses to mechanical stimuli; wing, ear, and head tremors; incoordination; and inability to fly when released. bat weights fluctuated minimally during the 45-day experiment. weight loss was recorded for the 106 s.c., 106 i.n., 104 s.c. and 104 i.n. groups. oral swabs collected on day 0 had detectable TCRV RNA. none of the day 4 p.i. oral swabs had detectable TCRV RNA. most of the oral swabs had TCRV RNA for the duration of the experiment.

(DPI) and were asymptomatic. on day 10, one bat was found dead, and during the next 8 days, the remaining bats died or were euthanized for humane reasons. weight loss was recorded for the 106 s.c., 106 i.n., 104 s.c., and 104 i.n. groups. bats that survived had minimal weight fluctuations during the 45-day experiment. however, bats that became moribund (674, 676, and 677) each had weight decline prior to euthanasia. oral swab collected from one bat had detectable TCRV RNA. none of the day 4 p.i. oral swabs had detectable TCRV RNA. most of the oral swabs had TCRV RNA for the duration of the experiment. Rectal 678 106 s.c. 45 Oral Rectal 674 106 s.c. 23 Oral Rectal indicates a sample that had detectable TCRV RNA. by day 6 p.i., rectal swabs from the remaining eight bats were negative for TCRV RNA by PCR. organ samples collected during the second experiment showed that only the three bats that died had detectable TCRV RNA in various organ samples. one bat was positive in the brain only, while the other two bats were positive in multiple organ samples. b UI, uninfected. c NAb, neutralizing antibody. Virus isolation from the second experiment was congruent with the PCR results. Virus isolation from the second experiment supported the findings from the organ PCR results. three bats (747, 714, and 748) exhibited mild to moderate multifocal necrosis and mild to moderate multifocal hepatocellular necrosis. most bats exhibited mild to moderate neutrophilic enteritis with crypt necrosis (necrosis of intestinal crypt cells) DISCUSSION Based on previous research, TCRV is the one known arenavirus thought to be hosted by bats and not rodents. results suggest that Jamaican fruit bats may not be reservoirs of TCRV. s.c. and i.n. inoculation resulted in infection in Jamaican fruit bats. none of the remaining bats survived past day 18 p.i. in the second experiment, dose and route were partitioned between four groups. three bats became moribund and were euthanized during the second experiment. the other nine remained healthy but appeared to still be shedding viral RNA on day 45 p.i. without signs of illness. it is unknown whether infectious virus was still present in the intestines. three bats had brain lesions, and each had tremors and TCRV RNA. a fourth brain, from a bat that died on day 11, had no remarkable brain lesions. a high dose resulted in no disease, seroconversion, and no detection of virus in organs. antibodies to TCRV were also detected in later studies of Trinidadian bats in the 1970s. it is possible that the artibeus bats from which TCRV was first isolated had been infected with the virus in Venezuela or elsewhere. this could account for the lack of serological evidence in other mammals surveyed in Trinidad, as reported by Downs et al. (11). transovarial transmission observed in some instances of Machupo virus in its reservoir host, the large vesper mouse (Calomys callosus), or neonatal or juvenile transmission in experimental infections of short-tailed cane mice (Zygodontomys brevicauda) it is also possible that some small proportion of bats may be \u201csuperspreaders\u201d (23), but because of the small sample sizes we used, they were not detected in our studies. to reisolate TCRV."}
