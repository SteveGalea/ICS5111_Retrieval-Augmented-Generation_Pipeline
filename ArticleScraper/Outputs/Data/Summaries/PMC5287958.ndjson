{"summary": "an electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic. results: a total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered eligible for this systematic review. osteonecrosis affects the femoral head in most cases. osteonecrosis is of various risk factors such as trauma, surgery of hip, corticosteroids, alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle-cell disease, and coagulopathy. systematic review (SR) published in 2009 collected related clinical researches in this field and drew a favorable result. however, this SR only included 5 studies, one of which was case report and another 4 were presented by same medical center. more literatures on this topic were published in recent years. quality appraisal Requisite data extracted from original articles and then recorded to standardized excel files included: surname of first author, publication year, number and age and gender of participants, number of affected hips, number of affected hips, ARCO stage, evaluation indicators and inclusion period. data extracted from original articles and then recorded to standardized excel files included: surname of first author, publication year, number and age and gender of participants, number of affected hips, ARCO stage, technological details of ESWT. results Through a computerized search using 3 electronic databases, altogether 42 potentially eligible records were retrieved. 12 studies were prospective ones and 5[15,22,26,28,29 were retrospective ones. all patients were diagnosed with ONFH. fourteen articles provided the energy intensity of ESWT. the results revealed obvious therapeutic success in 14 patients. group patients scored statistically differently at ARCO scale. a total of 335 patients involving 528 hips were divided into 2 groups. the improvement of Harris hip scores was mainly due to the reduction of pains and the lesion decrease on MRI after ESWT was not statistically significant. in 2016, ma et al[28] described a case of advanced ONFH opt not to THA and treated with radial ESWT. the therapy of leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is accompanied with a markedly elevated risk of ONFH. only 2 hips showed progressive femoral head collapse and accepted THA eventually. if a synergistic effect of ESWT exists, the overall clinical outcomes of 2 curative groups were comparable. the differences of pain and functional enhancement between 2 groups were not statistically significant. a better result of cocktail therapy than ESWT alone was still not tested. a total of 22 patients with ONFH of ARCO I\u2013III stage received 1 (or 2 if necessary) session of ESWT and were followed up for 1 year. the results revealed obvious therapeutic success in 14 patients. group patients scored statistically differently at ARCO scale. 28 hips were divided into 2 groups according to whether the lateral pillar of femoral head was preserved. the improvement of Harris hip scores was mainly due to the reduction of pains and the lesion decrease on MRI after ESWT was not statistically significant. a significant reduction of bone marrow edema was indeed observed. the therapy of leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is accompanied with a markedly elevated risk of ONFH. only 2 hips showed progressive femoral head collapse and accepted THA eventually. ESWT was valued more highly than THA in 13 patients. this result indicated that early detection of ONFH was crucial for its management. the differences of pain and functional enhancement between 2 groups were not statistically significant. arthroplasty has become a mature and reliable operation to remove clinical symptoms of advanced osteonecrosis of femoral head. the efficacy of most nonsurgical therapeutic methods for ONFH remains disputable, which made them not ready for widely recommendation. a total of 17 studies were retrieved and remarkable benefits of extracorporeal shockwave were found to be consistent in included articles. extracorporeal shockwave has the ability to propagate through necrotic femoral hips. at the depth of 10 mm of bone, a pressure loss of 50% of shockwave was observed. one hypothesis is that ESWT could induce microfracture to accelerate bone healing. radial ESWT has no need for location in advance but should be located with ultrasonography to avoid any possible damage. only 4 studies were classified as Ib evidence according to the Oxford Centre for EBM Levels of Evidence. there is no evidence that collaboration with other conservative methods could improve the curative effects of ESWT. however, these results should be interpreted carefully due to the low quality of included publications and further studies are required to validate the effect in ONFH."}
