{"summary": "introduction Salvia prattii (S. prattii) is extensively used in traditional Tibetan medicine. previous chemical investigations have proved that Salvia species possess two main classes of biologically active substances. diterpenes, the principal active constituents of other Salvia plants, have numerous pharmacological functions. prep-HPLC is preferred over other chromatography methods. a crude extract cannot be directly subjected to prep-HPLC separation. other separation techniques are usually required for enrichment of the main compounds of the crude extract. the HPLC analysis was carried out on an Agilent 1200 instrument. it consisted of a G1311A pump, a G1315D UV/Vis detector and an autosampler. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on an API 2000 mass spectrometer. a sample (NWIPB-SPH-2016-11-14) was handed over to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Museum of Biology (QPMB) the dried and milled samples (1.2 kg) were extracted thrice for 2 days using 95% ethanol (12.0 L for each extraction) at room temperature. the eluent from the HILIC-SPE column was collected in 100 mL fractions and analyzed by HPLC using a XION (250 mm 4.6 mm, 40\u201360 m) analytical column. the eluents with the same composition were collected and combined according to the HPLC analysis. the medium-exponential broth of sensitive strains treated without extracts, diterpenes and DMSO were considered as the negative control. the growth of only DMSO-treated sensitive strains was monitored to eliminate the effect of DMSO. UV, Mass, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on an API 2000 mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer. the test was performed on a Hanbon DAC-50 prep-HPLC system. chroomatographic grade n-hexane, ethanol, methanol and acetonitrile employed for the HPLC analysis were bought from Concord Chemical Ltd. (Tianjin, China) water was purified through a laboratory ultrapure water system from Chengdu ultra Tech (Chengdu, China) the XION (40\u201360 m) and Megress C18 (10 m) stationary phases were purchased from Acchrom (Beijing, China) and Hanbon the partially dried concentrate (approximately 0.5 L) was suspended in distilled water (2.0 L) the suspension was subsequently loaded onto a preprocessed middle chromatogram isolated gel (MCI) column (10 cm 100 cm, 2 kg, 2 kg), washed with 40% ethanol (12 L), eluted with of 80% ethanol (12 L) and further dried to yield 18.0 g of crude diterpenes-rich sample for ensuing HILIC-SPE pre- domonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Acinetobacter baumannii (obtained from the People\u2019s Liberation Army) were used as the instruction strains for the antibacterial activity assay. the two-fold serial dilutions of the active extracts and diterpenes (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) were added into the sensitive strains. the effluent was analyzed using a UV/Vis detector at 254 nm. the chromatogram was recorded at 254 nm, on a XAqua C3-column. water and methanol were the mobile phases A and B. the main diterpenes showed weak retention on the XION stationary phase with the mobile phases of 0.2% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile and in water. the main diterpenes showed weak retention on the XION stationary phase with the mobile phases of 0.2% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile and in water. hydrophilic interaction chromatography is usually packed with 2.1 g of stationary phase. one column volume is 2.1 mL (one column volume: weight of the stationary phase = 1 mL:1 g) the calculations used the following equation: A R A 2 H A A R P 2 H P = m A m P. the diterpene fractions were present in the eluates of the 16:4 and 14:6 v/v n-hexane/ethanol. the target fractions were divided into three groups (fractions I, II and III) with the n-hexane/ethanol mobile phase. antimicrobial activity of the crude diterpene-rich sample. fractions and, compounds (MIC in g/mL) RA and RP are the diameters of the analytical column (4.6 mm) and preparative column (50 mm), respectively. the comparable flow rate in the Megress C18 preparative column (250 mm 50 mm, 10 m) has been determined to be 59.1 mL/min. the resolution on the analytical and preparative chromatograms was RSA = 2(Rt2 Rt1)/(Wt2 + Wt1) = 2.55 and RSP = 1.2, respectively, due to sample-overloading and the preparative column diffusion effect. target compound chromatographic peaks were collected based on the UV absorption intensities considerably enhance the purity. the purities of the four isolated diterpenes were determined by HPLC on XAqua C3 analytical column. the results are given in Figure 4: Figure 4A\u2013D show that the compounds possess purity greater than 98% (98.6% for compound 1, 99.9% for compound 2, 99.1% for compound 3 and 99.7% for compound 4). the chemical structures of tanshinone IIA (compound 1), salvinolone (2), cryptotanshinone (3), and ferruginol (4) are shown in Figure 5. the detailed data of the compounds are given below. 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): 7.72 (1H, s, H-14), 6.45 (1H, s, H-6), 3.28 (2H, m, H-15), 1.67 (3H, s, H-20), 1.32 (3H, d, J = 6.5 Hz, H-17), 1.26 (3H, s, H-19), 1.30 (3H, d, J = 6.5 Hz, H-17), 1.26 (3H, s the ESI-MS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data for compound 3 agree with the literature data reported for cryptotanshinone. the ESI-MS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data for compound 3 agree with the literature data reported for cryptotanshinone [27]. crude diterpenes-rich extract with complex composition usually requires pretreatment. hexane-bond silica gel stationary phase showed weak retention on the XION stationary phase with the mobile phases of 0.2% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile and in water. the XION stationary phase should be used for sample pretreatment under the normal-phase mode due to the favorable separation profile. the conditions of (A,B) were the same: mobile phase A: n-hexane, and mobile phase B: ethanol; gradient: 0\u20138.4 min, 0% B.
