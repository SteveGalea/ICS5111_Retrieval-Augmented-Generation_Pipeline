{"summary": "necrosis is a highly conserved and strictly controlled physiological process by which unwanted cells are selectively eliminated. apoptosis is a highly conserved and strictly controlled physiological process by which unwanted cells are selectively eliminated. this mechanism also plays a critical role in normal development [2], stress response and adaptation. an increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bak induces the efflux of cytochrome-c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. cytochrome-c then complexes with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to activate caspase 9. this leads to the subsequent activation of caspase-3 and -7. IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis, an acute disease that renders the respiratory and urogenital tracts irreparable. the impact of IBV infection is greatly magnified as a consequence of its enhancement of diseases associated with co-infections by bacteria and mycoplasmas. targeted Bak and Mcl-1 down-regulation by siRNA revealed that IBV progeny production was enhanced in cells depleted of the pro-survival Mcl-1 protein and decreased in that of the pro-apoptotic Bak. also, IBV-induced apoptosis appeared earlier in Mcl-1 knockdown cells, and later in Bak knockdown cells, indicating the possibility that Mcl-1 and Bak may play diverging roles. mock virus stocks were made through three repeated freeze-thaw cycles. all recombinant and wild-type IBVs were propagated in vero cells. all recombinant and wild-type IBVs were propagated in vero cells.

PCR probe labeling PCR digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled DNA was used. crosslinked at 120 mJ/cm2 twice using the UV StratalinkerTM 2400 (Stratagene, California, USA) followed by pre-hybridization at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour. after hybridization, the membrane was washed in 2 SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.2 SSC, 0.1% SDS. terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using the ApoAlert\u00ae DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100 at room temperature. affymetrix array analysis of the expression of Bcl-2 family genes reveals up-regulation of Bak and Mcl-1 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 variant at the mRNA level in IBV-infected vero cells. a 5.28-fold induction of both Bak and Mcl-1 and a 2.3-fold reduction of Bcl-2 variant were detected. variant 2 BECN1 AF139131.1 0.7 BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein variant BAG-2 AF095192.1 0.7 BCL2-associated athanogene-family molecular chaperone regulator-2 BAG4 NM_004874.1 0.6 BCL2-associated athanogene 4 BAX NM_004324.1 0.4 BCL2-associated X protein BAG3 NM_004281.1 0.3 BCL2-associated athanogene 3 BA chicken fibroblast DF1 cells infected with IBV were either infected with IBV, harvested at 0, 8, 16 and 24 hours post-infection. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using specific primers for the indicated genes, with GAPDH as a loading control. blot analysis of all three IBV-infected mammalian cell lines showed an induction of both Bak and Mcl-1 transcripts at the mRNA level from 12\u201324 hours post-infection. mRNA of sufficient concentration could not be extracted for IBV-infected Huh7 cells at 24 hours post-infection due to death and detachment of the infected cells. northern blot analysis of Bak and Mcl-1 expression at the mRNA level in IBV-infected mammalian cells. vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells infected with (A) IBV or (B) UV-IBV were harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-infection. Mcl-1 induction showed a 4.96-, 5.97- and 9.75-fold increase. Bak induction saw a 7.00-, 10.66- and 4.04-fold increase in IBV-infected cells. cell lines were harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours post-infection. analysis of Bak monomer (24 kDa) expression showed up-regulation trend in IBV-infected Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells. densitometry measurements showed 1.02\u20131.79, 1.37\u20131.48 and 1.84\u20132.63 fold induction of Bak in IBV-infected cells from 8\u201320 hours post-infection. knockdown of Mcl-1 appears to speed up the onset of IBV-induced apoptosis. silencing of Bak causes a slight delay. detection of the caspase cleavage fragment (85 kDa) of PARP has long been considered to be a hallmark of apoptosis. the detection of the caspase cleavage fragment (85 kDa) of PARP has long been considered to be a hallmark of apoptosis. cells were transfected with pxj40-myc-Mcl-1, pxj40-myc-Bak or pxj40-myc empty vector. they were either mock-infected (M) or infected with IBV. cleavage was not observed in IBV-infected, siBak-transfected H1299 and Huh7 cells at 20 hours post-infection. the full-length PARP was not significantly cleaved in both IBV-infected H1299 and Huh7 transfected with Myc-Mcl-1. it was noted that a significant increase (2.88 fold) of PARP cleavage was observed in both H1299 and Huh7 cells transfected with siEGFP. this is reflecting a high level of viral replication in these cells as described in a later section. and LY294002 significantly reduced the Mcl-1 induction in both cell lines. the inhibitory effect observed was probably due to the reduced viral replication. ADD153 is a pro-apoptotic transcription factor and well-known component of several ER stress-mediated pathways. downstream of the ER stress\u2013mediated up-regulation of GADD153 expression is a correlated suppression of Akt signaling. the activation of the latter is, in turn, known to up-regulate Mcl-1 through its Akt kinase [40]. Western blotting analysis of viral proteins in total cell lysates and culture medium. the viability of IBV was heavily influenced by transfection reagents. cells were harvested for Northern blot analysis using specific probes for Bak, Mcl-1 and the 3\u2032-UTR of IBV. the effects of over-expression of Bak and Mcl-1 on the synthesis of IBV proteins in mammalian cells. l-1 and Bak in mammalian cells shown in Fig. 4 on IBV replication and release were analysed by Western blot analysis. expression of IBV-S protein in total cell lysates showed little or no increase in IBV infected H1299 (96%) and Huh 7 (90) cells over-expressing Bak as compared to similarly infected control cells. expression of 11 Bcl-2-related genes at the mRNA level was up-regulated and 2 down-regulated. a 5.28-fold induction of both Bak and Mcl-1 and a 2.3-fold reduction of Bcl-2 variant were detected. LL/lymphoma 2 nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial protein transcript variant IBV infection of vero cells, chicken embryos and chicken fibroblast cells up-regulates Bak, Mcl-1, Bax and Bcl-2. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using specific primers for the indicated genes, with G. 10-day-old chicken embryos were inoculated with either mock virus (M) or IBV (1000 plaque-forming units per egg) in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 48 hours. total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues and used for RT-PCR. increased expression levels of Bak (2.37 fold) and Mcl-1 (1.92 fold) were also observed. densitometry measurement showed a 1.04\u20134.66-fold and a 0.85\u20133.92-fold induction of Bak and Mcl-1 In IBV-infected vero cells, significant induction of Mcl-1 (1.67\u20139.51 fold) was detected from 12\u201324 hours post-infection. however, relatively less efficient induction of Bak (1.09\u20132.83 fold) was observed as the basal level of Bak is much higher in this cell line. 7 cells infected with IBV were harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 36 hours post-infection, respectively. western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies as indicated, with anti-actin as a loading control. same amounts of UV-inactivated IBV were incubated with the three cells. densitometry measurements of the corresponding bands showed a 1.26\u20132.59 fold induction of Mcl-1 In IBV-infected Vero cells from 8\u201320 hours post-infection. up-regulation of Mcl-1 protein expression was also observed in IBV-infected H1299 (1.1\u20131.97 fold) and Huh7 (2.35\u20132.98 fold) cells. this could be due to fact that Mcl-1 has a short half-life. apoptotic cells were either mock-infected or infected with IBV. at 20 and 24 hours post-infection, cells were fixed and permeabilized. knockdown of Mcl-1 appears to speed up the onset of IBV-induced apoptosis. western blot analysis of effects of down-regulation of Bak and Mcl-1 by RNA interference in mammalian cells on IBV-induced apoptosis. at 72 hours post-transfection, cells were infected with IBV and harvested at 20 and 24 hours post-infection. a PARP cleavage fragment in both cell lines appeared to be inversely correlated with Mcl-1 expression levels. a significantly more amount of the cleavage product was detected in IBV-infected, siBak-transfected and Huh7 cells at 20 hours post-infection. ilenced Huh7 cells at 24 hours post-infection could be attributed to a slight decrease in Mcl-1 expression in the Bak knockdown cells. these results confirm that Mcl-1 may play a part in the regulation of IBV-induced apoptosis. a decrease in the Mcl-1 expression in cells could enhance IBV-induced apoptosis at earlier stages of infection. IBV-mediated Mcl-1 induction is reduced by inhibition of both ERK and PI3K pathways. we then checked the upstream signaling pathways that may play a role in regulating the induction of Mcl-1 in IBV-infected cells. recent reports suggested that ER stress may be involved in regulation of Mcl-1 and other Bcl-2 family of proteins. the relative fold of Mcl-1 induction in IBV-infected cells was determined by comparing with mock-infected cells. the inhibitory effects of U0126 on virus infection warrant a closer look of the upstream signals that may regulate the MAP/ERK pathway. duction of cells transfected with either siRNA duplexes targeting GADD153 (siGADD153) or a non-targeting control (siControl) were infected with IBV at an M.O.I of 1 for 16\u201320 hours and harvested for Western blot analysis. we observed a corresponding reduction in expression of Mcl-1 (40\u201373% down-regulation) with a decreased GADD153 expression. the effects of down-regulation of Bak and Mcl-1 by RNA interference on the replication and transcription of IBV RNA in mammalian cells. H1299 cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting Mcl-1, Bak and EGFP. knockdown of either Bak or Mcl-1 renders minimal, if any, effects on replication and transcription of IBV RNA. no consistent trends of increase/decrease of viral RNA were observed in Bak and Mcl-1 knockdown cells infected with IBV. the contrary was observed in the culture medium of infected cells over-expressing Mcl-1. overexpression of myc-Mcl-1 significantly inhibited the replication of IBV in H1299 cells. these results confirm respective roles Mcl-1 and Bak play in regulating the rate of both IBV-induced apoptosis and viral progeny release. up-regulation of Bak and Mcl-1 may play essential roles in maintaining balance between life and death of infected cells. this points to the importance of these two members of the Bcl2 gene family in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis. up-regulation of Mcl-1 in IBV-infected cells may represent an effective host anti-coronavirus response that regulates viral infectivity and productivity. the down-regulation observed during late stages of virus infection may be due to the rapid degradation of the protein. however, it is apparent that viral replication is required for the up-regulation of these two genes at the transcriptional level. the induction of Mcl-1 protein in IBV-infected cells is indeed affected by the activation of MEK and/or PI3K pathways, as well as by upstream activators such as the transcriptional regulator of ER-stress mediated apoptosis. the observed up-regulation of GADD153 in this study would lend further support to this conclusion. poptotic viral genes can be harnessed as vectors and targeted to tumor cells as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic benefit. degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntingdon's disease may also be similarly treated with anti-apoptotic viral genes."}
