{"summary": "ecto-ARTs and poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases (PARPs) catalyse mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation. ecto-ARTs catalyse mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation. poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins represents a unique subgroup of ARTs. yl)ation and PARP family are inherently present only in eukaryotes (with exception of yeast), while prokaryotes and archaea were traditionally thought to be devoid of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation machinery. it was recently shown that some bacterial species do indeed possess PARP proteins that are highly homologous to the vertebrate PARPs. a branching reaction has been suggested to occasionally occur through the 2'',1''-o-glycosidic bond, resulting in a highly complex network of PAR polymers. PARPs catalyse the transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety from NAD+ to a target protein with the concomitant release of nicotinamide. the most robust poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation upon genotoxic stress is on PARP1 itself (automodification) chromatin remodelers such as ALC1 and CHD4 and the histone chaperone APLF are also recruited to DNA damage sites through PAR binding. another major site of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is the mitotic apparatus (mitotic spindle, centromeres and centrosome) poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) cleaves PAR chains and releases mono(ADP-ribose) as the main reaction product [10,46,47] the precise molecular mechanisms of how PARGs recognize and degrade the PAR chains will be addressed in detail later in this review. responsible for the removal of the mono(ADP-ribose) from PARP protein targets remains unknown. over the last decade, four evolutionary conserved PAR-binding modules have been discovered within numerous proteins with various functions. the PBM was the first discovered protein motif with the ability to recognize and bind PAR [29]. poly(ADP-Ribose)-Binding Zinc Finger (PBZ) appears to be much less widespread compared to PBM. PBZ is restricted to only eukaryotic proteins (excluding yeast) the structures of the APLF and CHFR PBZs suggest that a single PBZ module contains two binding sites that simultaneously recognize adenines in two neighbouring ADP-ribose units of the PAR polymer. this type of recognition makes the PBZ motifs truly specific PAR binding modules. phosphate groups on each side of the iso-ADP-ribose molecule interact with the highly positively charged edge of the WWE domain binding site. the adenine ring is inserted in the binding pocket formed by the half -barrel and the -helix. the mechanisms of recognition explain the specificity of the WWE domain for iso-ADP-ribose and consequently the PAR polymer. chromatin remodeler ALC1 uses its macrodomain to bind the PAR synthesized by PARP1 in response to DNA damage. the crystal structure of the macrodomain module suggests that the macrodomain is only able to bind the terminal ADP-ribose units of the PAR polymer [70]. the X-ray repair cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC1) is a prominent example of a DNA repair factor that is recruited to DNA strand breaks. a crystal structure of the PBM in complex with PAR or a PAR fragment is not available, and therefore the precise molecular nature of this interaction is not clear. a single PBZ module contains two binding sites that can simultaneously recognize adenines in two neighbouring ADP-ribose units of the PAR polymer. however, the function of this domain in PAR binding was reported only recently for the RNF146 ubiquitin ligase. a number of proteins involved in the DNA damage response are targeted to proteosomal degradation through PAR recognition. the interaction between RNF146 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated axin promotes the degradation of this key regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway. the underlying mechanism of the RNF146 interaction with PAR was recently revealed. the presence of macrodomains is widespread in all kingdoms of life, including prokaryotes and archaea. af1521 from a thermophilic archeabacterium was the first macrodomain protein for which the binding of NAD metabolites, including ADP-ribose was reported. the crystal structure of this macrodomain revealed the general structural fold and the ligand binding pocket of this PAR binding module. the first catalytically active macrodomains were reported for viral macrodomains including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the yeast homolog Poa1p (YBR022) these proteins dephosphorylate ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate, a metabolite that arises from tRNA splicing. structural analysis suggests that both the larger canonical PARG N-terminal accessory domain and the smaller bacterial alpha-helical extension stabilise the PARG catalytic loop. both glutamates are critical for catalysis, and mutation of these residues leads to a complete loss of PARG activity [10,47,76]. -ribose positions the unique O-glycosydic ribose-ribose bond between N and N-1 ADP-ribose groups in direct hydrogen contact with the two glutamates of the PARG signature sequence. the oxocarbenium intermediate is stabilized by the close proximity of the terminal adenosine diphosphate group. mono(ADP-ribose) (N ADP ribose) is released as the main in canonical PARGs, a loop named the tyrosine clasp [46] contains a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr296 in T. thermophila and Tyr795 in human PARG) this residue interacts with the adenine base of the central, N ADP-ribose. the equivalent of this loop is not found in bacterial-type PARGs. two shorter isoforms of human PARG, PARG102 and PARG99 lack the NLS and PIP box, while PARG60 lacks the entire regulatory region. highly divergent bacterial-type PARG represented by Thermomonospora curvata PARG contains the catalytic macrodomain and an N-terminal accessory element (yellow) the PARG regulatory region is poorly characterised, but it was recently discovered that it bears a PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) binding motif (PIP box), which was shown to be critical for PARG recruitment to DNA damage sites through a PAR-independent pathway. there is a short 16 residue motif which connects the aforementioned regulatory domain and the catalytic region of vertebrate PARGs. targeting PARG may represent an alternative approach in modulating poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. however, redundancy of PARP genes with overlapping yet distinct functions makes the targeting of specific PARP dependent pathways difficult. the development of small, cell-permeable PARG inhibitors would provide a major advantage as a powerful tool to study PAR metabolism. PARG catalyses the hydrolysis of the ribose-ribose bonds of the PAR polymer and is responsible for reversing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in cells. lytic loop is a part of the PARG macrodomain. it contains the consensus signature sequence (GGG-X6-8-QEE) both glutamates are critical for catalysis. mutation of these residues leads to a complete loss of PARG activity. the conserved phenylalanine residue from the macrodomain-wide GVFG motif is then nucleophilically attacked by a water molecule. mono(ADP-ribose) (N ADP ribose) is released as the main reaction product [10,47] in canonical PARGs, a loop named the tyrosine clasp [46] contains a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr296 in T. thermophila endoglycohydrolase activity of the canonical PARGs has never been demonstrated using recombinant PARGs. the full-length human PARG contains an N-terminal regulatory region (A-domain; blue) which includes a nuclear localisation signal (NLS), PCNA binding motif (PIP box) and a nuclear export signal (NES). the key O-glycosydic ribose-ribose bond is positioned in direct hydrogen bonding contact with the catalytic glutamate 256 (Glu756 in human PARG; grey brackets) the 2\u2019-OH leaving group of n-1 ADP-ribose\u2019 is protonated (black arrow) by the catalytic glutamate. a subsequently formed oxocarbenium intermediate is stabilised by the close proximity of the terminal di PARG is encoded by a single gene but is alternatively spliced into multiple isoforms. the longest isoform PARG111 is targeted to the nucleus due to the presence of a nuclear localisation signal encoded within the first 20 amino acids. the shorter isoforms such as PARG102 PARG99 and PARG60 lack this motif. studies using RNAi silencing in human cells have already demonstrated that PARG deficiency results in increased sensitivity to radiation, DNA-alkylating agents and chemotherapeutics. all existing PARG inhibitors are non cell-permeable and can therefore only be useful for in vitro experiments. the development of small, cell-permeable PARG inhibitors could significantly improve their efficiency and cell-permeability. PARG is the major enzyme involved in the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation through the efficient degradation of PAR polymers. this catalytic function is mediated largely through PARG\u2019s macrodomain. future studies of the PARG enzyme will provide new breakthroughs in understanding the cellular pathways regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation."}
