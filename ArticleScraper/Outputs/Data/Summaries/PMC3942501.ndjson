CHIKV is relatively higher than that of the A. aegypti and H. sapiens. aegypti had the strongest effect on the east central south africa (ECSA) genotype, followed by west africa (WA) and Asian genotypes. codon usage was also the highest between CHIKV and A. albopictus. the successful human-to-human transmission of CHIKV depends on Aedes mosquitoes. the stronger effect of A. albopictus on all three genotypes suggests that this vector might be a more efficient reservoir for viral replication and transmission compared with A. albopictus. different genotypes of CHIKV may have common ancestor. this suggests geographical diversity and associated factors have also contributed to shaping molecular evolution and codon usage in CHIKV. mutational pressure and natural selection are considered the two major factors that shape codon usage patterns. negative correlations with GC% (r = 0.798, P0.01) and GC% (r = 0.5877, P0.01) and G% (r = 0.217, P0.01) were observed. no correlation was observed between A3% and the GC%. a3% U3% C3% G3% GC3% A% 0.625** 0.278** 0.261** 0.610** 0.090NS U% 0.373** 0.621** 0.587** 0.354** 0.480** C% 0.327** 0.606** 0.621** 0.377** 0.498** G% 0.576** 0.185* 0.217** 0.658** 0.080NS GC% 0.103NS 0.806** 0.798** 0.153 f\u20322 axis showed significantly positive correlations with C3 (r = 0.69, P0.01), GC3% (r = 0.74, P0.01; Figure 7B), GC% (r = 0.64, P0.01), A% (r = 0.17, P0.05) and G% (r = 0.39, P0.01). negative correlations with U3% (r = 0.66, P0.01), and U% (r = 0.34, P0.01). a plot of ENC versus GC3 (Nc plot) is widely used to study codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. it has been postulated that an ENC-plot of genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a G3+ C3 mutational bias, will lie just below the continuous curve of the predicted ENC values [30]. the relative abundance of CpG showed deviation from the normal range. GpC dinucleotides also deviated from the normal range. despite slight over-representation of the GpC dinucleotide, all codons were also under-represented. uU UC UA UG CU CC CA CG Mean SD 0.9540.030

is believed to be responsible for its under-representation. eight codons containing CpA (UCA, CCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, CAA, CAG, CAU and CAC) were also over-represented compared with the rest of the 14 dinucleotide pairs. a majority of them were also preferential codons for their respective amino acids, based on RSCU analysis. 16 dinucleotides, 11 significantly (positive and negative) correlated with the first axis. 16 significantly (positive and negative) correlated with the second axis. selection pressure associated with (i) maintenance of efficient replication and transmission cycles among

biased and would be mainly. previous studies on codon usage analysis among other RNA viruses have also reported lower codon usage bias. the same is also true in the case of arthropod-borne RNA viruses, including west Nile virus (ENC: 53.81) [15] and dengue virus (DENV) codon usage patterns of CHIKV were a mixture of coincidence and antagonism to its hosts and vectors. the preferred codons for 12 out of 18 amino acids were common between CHIKV and H. sapiens. in case of transmission vectors, 10 out of 18 preferred codons were common among both mosquito species and CHIKV. out of 18 preferred codons were common between, with exceptions for the preferred codons for Asp and Gly. selection pressures from hosts and vectors have influenced the codon usage pattern of CHIKV and the possible fitness of the virus to adjust among its dynamic range of hosts and vectors. a mixture of coincidence and antagonism has also been reported previously in the case of HCV [31] and enterovirus 71 [13]. aegypti vs. CHIKV is lowest in the case of H. sapiens vs. CHIKV. the effect of transmission vectors on the formation of the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV is relatively higher than that of the A. aegypti and H. sapiens. similarity index of codon usage was also highest between CHIKV and A. albopictus. compared with A. aegypti, P. troglodytes and H. sapiens. plots were reconstructed based on different geographical locations. the CHIKV isolates belonging to ECSA genotype were distributed across all planes of axes. this analysis showed that different genotypes of

has played a major role in shaping the dynamics of codon usage patterns within CHIKV genomes. a plot of ENC versus GC3 is widely used to study codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. it has been postulated that an ENC-plot of genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a G3+ C3 mutational bias, will lie on or just below the continuous curve of the predicted ENC values [30]. occurrences of dinucleotides were not randomly distributed, and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies. relative abundance of CpG showed deviation from the \u201cnormal range\u201d. Interestingly, GpC dinucleotides also deviated from the normal range. recognition of umethylated CpGs by toll like receptor 9 leads to activation of several immune response pathways. the vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a signature of infection. a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system that recognizes CpGs when in an RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) Mean SD 0.9290.015 1.0550.014 0.987.0078 1.0240.006 1.0540.014 1.0010.007 1.0120.009 0.9310.010 Range 0.884\u20130.987 0.998\u20131.097 0.963\u20131.008 1.009\u20131.037 1.007\u20131.117 0.965\u20131.020 0.996\u20131.037 0.900\u20130.954 Axis 1 r 0.145NS 0.39NS 0.387** 0.236** 0.80NS codons containing UpA (UUA, CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC and AUA) were also under-represented (RSCU1.6) and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids. eight codons containing CpA (UCA, CCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, CAG, CAU and CAC) were also over-represented compared with the rest of the 14 dinucleotide pairs. pG usage and the existence of an RNA dinucleotide recognition system have also been proposed. the relative abundance of dinucleotides was also correlated with the first two principal axes. selection pressure associated with (i) maintenance of efficient replication and transmission cycles among multiple hosts has contributed to shaping the overall synonymous codon usage in CHIKV. correlation analysis among GRAVY, ARO, ENC, GC3, GC and the first two principle axes. f\u20321 (53.57%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) f\u20322 (25.16%) plots were reconstructed based on different geographical locations. the CHIKV isolates belonging to ECSA genotype were distributed across all planes of axes. this analysis showed that different genotypes of CHIKV might have common ancestor. no correlation was observed between A3% and the GC%. positive correlation was noted with C% (r = 0.498, P0.01) and GC% (r = 0.852, P0.01) and negative correlation with U% (r = 0.480, P0.01). this analysis collectively indicates that mutational pressure is most likely responsible for the patterns of nucleotide composition. this analysis collectively indicates that mutational pressure is most likely responsible for the patterns of nucleotide composition. in the case of f2, A3%, G3% and C% had non-significant correlations. f\u20322 axis showed significantly positive correlations with C3 (r = 0.69, P0.01), GC3% (r = 0.74, P0.01; Figure 7B), GC% (r = 0.64, P0.01), A% (r = 0.17, P0.05) and G% (r = 0.39, P0.01). a plot of ENC versus GC3 is widely used to study codon usage variation among genes in different organisms. it has been postulated that an ENC-plot of genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a G3+ C3 mutational bias, will lie on or just below the continuous curve of the predicted ENC values [30]. occurrences of dinucleotides were not randomly distributed, and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies. relative abundance of CpG showed deviation from the \u201cnormal range\u201d and was under-represented.

is believed to be responsible for its under-representation. s containing UpA (UUA, CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC and AUA) were also under-represented (RSCU1.6) and were not preferred codons for their respective
