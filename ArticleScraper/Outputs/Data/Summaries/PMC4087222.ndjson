{"summary": "IBV is highly infectious and spreads rapidly in unprotected birds. there are a large number of IBV variants worldwide. inactivated and live attenuated virus vaccines have been used to protect chickens against IBV. virus-like particles are multi-protein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses without viral genomes. chimeric VLPs have been generated by substituting part or all of the extracellular domain of a surface antigen of a VLP derived from one virus with one from another virus. chimeric VLPs have been shown to induce immune responses against the surface antigen from the other virus. the fusion protein and avian influenza virus M1 protein were assembled to form chimeric VLPs. these chimeric VLPs were then prepared quantitatively and used as immunogens in BALB/c mice and SPF chickens. the chimeric VLPs showed the potential for use as a candidate vaccine against IBV. the full-length of the fusion gene was 1674 bp. it contained the CT and TM domains of NA (1120 bp) and the S1 sequence (1211,674 bp) the primers used to generate S1 were CAATATGGGTCATGTCGTACTACCATC (forward primer 1) and ACGCGTCGACACGTCTAAAACGACGTGTT (reverse primer 2). rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 infected cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 after 72 h. fusion protein was detected with chicken polyclonal sera against IBV H120 virus and the M1 protein was detected with chicken polyclonal sera against influenza virus H5N1. sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing NA/S1 and M1 at a MOI of 5. after removing cells by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 30 min, the VLPs in the supernatants were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 80,000 g for 2 h and then resuspended in PBS. each dose of chimeric VLPs or inactivated IBV H120 viruses contained 2 g of S1 protein plus complete Freund's adjuvants. each dose of chimeric VLPs or inactivated IBV H120 viruses contained 2 g of S1 protein plus MONTANIDE ISA 206 (SEPPIC, France) as an adjuvant. anti-chicken secondary antibodies (Proteintech Group) diluted 5000-fold were added. signals were visualized with ELISA substrate reagents. murine spleens were collected from sacrificed mice 14 days after third immunization. IBV strain H120 (accession number M21970) was propagated in 9-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. genes encoding NA and M1 proteins of influenza virus A/GOOSE/GD/96 (H5N1; Access No. NC_007363) and S1 protein of IBV H120 were obtained by RT-PCR and then cloned into pMD-18T vector. PCR products were mixed equally to generate the fusion gene NA/S1 by PCR using forward primer 1 and reverse primer 2. the nucleotide sequences of the NA/S1 fusion and M1 genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then cloned into pFast-Bac-Dual vector. the purified recombinant bacmid DNA was then transfected into sf9 cells with cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen indirect immunofluorescence Sf9 cells were grown on 24 24 mm glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates. rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 infected cells were treated with 0.3% TrintonX-100. control cells were infected with wild-type baculoviruses. the particles were purified through a 20-30-40-50% discontinuous sucrose gradient at 80,000 g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. electron microscopy The purified VLPs were analyzed by electron microscopy as previously described. each dose of chimeric VLPs or inactivated IBV H120 viruses contained 2 g of S1 protein plus MONTANIDE ISA 206 (SEPPIC, France) as an adjuvant. ELISA Serum S1-specific antibodies were analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) the number of spots was counted by an immunospot ELISPOT reader. diluted serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. the mixture of serum and H120 virus was inoculated into 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. fusion protein NA/S1 and protein expression in sf9 cells. protein was fused to the CT and TM domain of the NA protein of H5N1. chimeric VLPs were generated by co-infection of sf9 cells. rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 with different MOIs were used to co-infect cells. chimeric VLPs were purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradients. chimeric VLPs had diameters of about 100 nm, showing morphological characteristics similar to standard influenza VLPs. ants were then collected and purified by discontinuous sucrose step density gradient centrifugation. the 4050% fraction was collected and analyzed for detection of NA/S1 and M1. chimeric VLPs induced higher S1-specific antibodies than inactivated IBV H120 viruses. single-cell suspensions of splenocytes prepared from the spleens of thrice-vaccinated mice were stimulated by inactivated H120 virus. chimeric VLPs elicited higher levels of IL-4 production than inactivated H120 viruses (p 0.01; Fig. 4A), while both induced comparable IFN- production. serum samples were collected on the 14th day after the third immunization to determine neutralization antibody titers. data represent the mean SD of six mice. chimeric VLPs were as efficient at stimulating total anti-S1 antibodies as inactivated viruses. serum samples from immunized chickens were collected on 28th day post immunization. 100 TCID50 IBV H120 was mixed with serial diluted sera. the neutralization titer was then expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution. western blot analysis of expression of fusion protein NA/S1 in sf9 cells. rBV-N/S1 cells were infected with rBV-N/S1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, after which the cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with S1-specific antibodies. fusion protein NA/S1 and rBV-M1 were co-infected with rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 at an MOI of 5. the control cells were infected by wt BV at an MOI of 5. infected cells were fixed and stained by antibodies. Purified S1 protein was selected for the ELISA experiments. chimeric VLPs induced higher S1-specific antibodies than inactivated IBV H120 viruses. chimeric VLPs induced higher S1-specific antibodies than inactivated IBV H120 viruses. ELISPOT assays of IL-4 and IFN- cytokine-secreting splenocytes in mice. cytokine-secreting cells were determined by ELISPOT assays. spots for cytokine-producing cells from the spleen were counted. the chimeric VLP group and the inactivated H120 viruses group both exhibited a higher level of antibodies than the PBS control group (p 0.01). the level of antibodies of the chimeric VLP group was higher than that of the H120 group (p 0.05). chimeric VLPs could be assembled by co-expressing fusion protein NA/S1 and influenza virus M1 protein. results showed that chimeric VLPs were immunogenic and induced S1-specific antibody responses at a higher level than the inactivated H120 viruses. a higher level of IL-4 was detected in the VLPs group than inactivated H120 viruses. chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than inactivated IBV viruses."}
