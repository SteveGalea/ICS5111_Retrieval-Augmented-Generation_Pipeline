{"summary": "the discovery of heavy chain-only antibodies in the serum of camels opened the way for a new toolbox for diverse therapeutic applications. the epitope-binding unit of these so-called heavy chain-only antibodies thus consists of a single variable domain, called a single-domain antibody (VHH) immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been isolated from immune, nave or synthetic libraries. these libraries are built based on a well characterized VHH of which the conserved FRs are retained and amino acids in the CDRs are altered by saturating site specific mutagenesis. fusion protein (F) in prefusion state could prevent virus entry by inhibiting membrane fusion between virus and host cells. intrabodies can affect viral replication and nuclear transport of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) a VHH against the HIV Rev protein could inhibit nuclear export of viral mRNA. VHH formatting can be explored to develop new diagnostic tools for infectious diseases. different VHH formats and their functionality used to tackle various viral infections. VHH format Functionality Virus Reference Homobivalent VHHs - Enhance and broaden antiviral activity RSV Influenza Rabies HIV Hultberg et al. VHH linked to ferritin - Half-life extension Influenza Fan et al. [32] VHH linked to COMP48 - Enhance and broaden antiviral activity Influenza Tillib et al. [58] VHH linked to IgG - Effector function - Targeting HIV Sun et al. a single VHH molecule has a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa. it is ten times smaller than a conventional IgG antibody (size around 150 kDa) it is important to note that there is no strict correlation between the molecular weight of a molecule and its half-life. the goal is to limit their renal elimination and to recover the already available circulating VHH molecules. a simple way to accomplish this is by coupling two or three homologous or heterologous VHHs via a specific linker. however, even bivalent constructs are rapidly cleared. the use of recombinant PEG mimetics to extend a drug\u2019s half-life has roused the interest of companies to explore safer and more economical alternatives. the use of recombinant PEG mimetics that can be genetically fused to the molecule of interest is one example of such an alternative. serum albumin has a terminal elimination half-life of 17\u201319 days in human. a study by Hoefman et al. reported a significant increase in half-life of different mono-, di- or trimeric VHH constructs by fusing them to an albumin binding VHH. the half-life of albumin in rodents and other small mammals is only around 1\u20132.5 days. a genetic fusion between a FMDV-neutralizing VHH and a VHH targets the porcine IgG was possible. a 100-fold increase in half-life was observed when binding to porcine IgG was possible. a fourth approach of extending the half-life is to fuse the VHH of interest to the Fc region or other Fc-binding moieties of an IgG molecule. the effect of binding to the FcRn was not reported in these studies. the affinity of an antiviral VHH picked up by an initial selection step still needs to be improved to enhance and broaden its neutralizing capacity. multivalent constructs were generated against the RSV F fusion protein, influenza H5N1 HA and Rabies G protein. linking two identical anti-F VHHs increased the neutralizing capacity by approximately 4000. bivalent and trivalent anti-HA and bivalent anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G VHHs had significantly higher neutralizing potency than their monovalent counterparts. ama IgG2c hinge is a flexible linker to fuse two identical anti-influenza neuraminidase (NA) (H5N1) VHHs. a bivalent version of the VHH R1a-B6, generated by fusing two identical VHHs directed against the stem of HA of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, had a similar neutralizing potency against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses as monovalent R1a intranasal administration of a bivalent RSV F-specific VHH and a bivalent rabies G-specific VHH showed increased in vivo potency compared to the monovalent counterpart. in vitro experiments, the trivalent VHH outperformed palivizumab, a monoclonal humanized antibody directed against the same epitope of the RSV F protein and currently used as a prophylactic anti-RSV treatment. the bispecific fusion construct with a GS linker hardly increased the potency compared with the individual monovalent VHHs. such an influence was observed for bispecific VHHs (JM2x5 or JM5x2) directed against the CD4-binding site or CD4-binding induced site of HIV-1 gp120. fenobodies fused influenza H5N1 NA-specific VHHs to a mouse IgG2a-derived Fc domain. they showed a 250-fold higher NA inhibition and approximately 50-fold higher in vitro antiviral activity compared to the monovalent VHHs. conventional antibodies can also employ Fc-mediated effector functions. an Fc fusion greatly increases the serum half-life and enhances target antigen binding through an avidity effect (Table 1). for some antiviral VHH-Fcs the importance of the acquired Fc-associated effector functions has been investigated, e.g., in in vitro assays. non-neutralizing VP6-specific IgA monoclonal antibodies do protect mice against rotavirus infection when given systemically but not when delivered at the luminal side of the intestine. as such non-neutralizing VP6-specific IgA could control rotavirus replication in vivo during transcytosis. intracellular antibody receptor TRIM21 is expected to have unaffected interaction with the Fc receptors. this suggests that next to direct neutralization, Fc-ARP may additionally mediate intracellular neutralization after internalization via FcRn and binding to TRIM21. other Fc effector functions might also contribute to the protection provided by Fc-ARP1. the experimental molecule MD3606 is comprised of a head-to-tail fusion of four different VHHs linked to a human IgG Fc region. these VHHs can potently neutralize group 1 influenza A viruses, group 2 influenza A viruses, Victoria lineage influenza B or Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses. this clearly shows the importance of the Fc effector functions for the antiviral activity of VHH-Fc proteins. a VHH that specifically targets the human FcR III (CD16) fused to a tumor antigen-specific VHH could kill tumor cells by inducing ADCC and reduce tumor growth in mice that were xenografted with tumor cells and human PBMCs. a VHH targeting the herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D can bind to cells that express this protein but fails to neutralize HSV-2 infection in vitro. this VHH (R dapivirine encapsulated in liposomes had higher antiviral activity than free dapivirine. conjugation of J3 to dapivirine loaded liposomes did not further increase antiviral activity. further optimization could lead to a more pronounced antiviral therapy. the use of genetically modified micro-organisms is restricted to organs with a microbiome such as the gut, the skin, the nasal cavity and the vagina. other organs can be targeted by linking the VHH to a VHH that specifically binds to an organ-specific marker protein. et al. described a strategy to target HIV-neutralizing VHHs towards the lipid rafts on the cell membrane. a gene construct was made linking the coding information of the HIV CD4-receptor gp120-binding JM4 with the GPI signal sequence. this could be achieved by modifying patient-derived CD4+ cell with lentiviral vectors carrying the GPI-VHH sequence and then transfusing these cells back to the patient. some viral targets may be located inside the infected cell. this problem can be overcome by linking the VHH to a cell-penetrating peptide. this approach has been applied for the development of anti-hepatitis C virus. more than 40 different genotypes are classified into two main genogroups. one VHH that recognizes an epitope in the lower region of the protruding domains of the norovirus capsid was developed into a tool for rapid diagnostics. the use of multiple VHHs, that ideally also recognize genotype I noroviruses, would likely contribute to a higher sensitivity. hepatitis B core-based virus-like particles (VLPs) can be expressed in robust expression systems such as those based on E. coli and plants. a similar VLP with a VHH directed against a nondisclosed virus was also generated by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. fusion of identical VHHs or VHHs recognizing different epitopes or fusion to multimerizing protein moieties has successfully been demonstrated to enhance and broaden neutralization activity. a key component in the generation of long-lasting antiviral therapeutics is the implementation of half-life extension techniques such as PEGylation, fusion to a serum albumin-binding VHH."}
