{"summary": "all enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, fuse with cellular membranes. the virus bind to cell surface receptors and are endocytosed and fuse with endosomes. the virus S protein mediates fusion between viral and host cell membranes. imatinib blocks the entry of pseudotyped virions containing SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S protein [15]. this strongly suggests that the Abl kinase signalling pathway is a promising topic to investigate for the development of antiviral therapies. BV S is inhibited by imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 prior to hemifusion. results suggest a role for Abl kinases in both virus\u2013cell and cell\u2013cell fusion events. imatinib lowers SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV titres [15] supernatants were harvested 18 h post-infection. a plaque assay was used to measure the viral titres of all samples. all three drugs significantly decreased the virus titre. imatinib and GNF5 reduced the number of cells infected by 90 %. the inhibition by GNF2 and GNF5 suggests that Abl1 and/or Abl2 specifically play a role in IBV infection. vero cells were pre-treated for 1 h with DMSO, 10 M imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. adsorption was performed at 4 \u00b0C to allow the synchronization of virus-receptor binding. cells were washed, fresh medium containing DMSO or drug was added. imatinib was removed from the cell culture medium immediately after adsorption. infection proceeded normally and the viral titres matched those in untreated cells. but when imatinib was present for at least 1 h post-adsorption during virus fusion and entry, the viral titres decreased significantly. washed, fresh medium containing DMSO or imatinib was added. infection was allowed to proceed for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C. supernatants were harvested and used for plaque assays. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of nuclei per syncytium. average syncytium size was reduced to 5, 6 and 4 nuclei for imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 respectively, an 95 % reduction in the presence of each drug. fected cells with abl kinase inhibitors significantly reduced the number of nuclei per syncytium to 4 nuclei for imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5, an 80 % reduction. to this end, we also tested the effects of all three drugs on syncytia formation produced by the SARS-CoV S protein. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 had no effect on the total number of cells expressing VSV-G after the transfection of a control plasmid. results demonstrate that imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 interfere with syncytia formation mediated by the S protein both during IBV infection and when S protein is expressed exogenously in the absence of infection. bars represent standard deviation and P values were calculated using a paired t-test. Imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 block IBV S-induced fusion prior to hemifusion. fusion events were observed and categorized as full fusion or hemifusion. we observed 54 total fusion events in the control sample. hemifusion events accounted for 14 % of all fusion events from control cells. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 showed no significant change in the percentage of hemifusion events. this suggests that abl kinase inhibitors block the initial hemifusion step. total fusion events in control and drug-treated cells were normalized to 100 %. black and white indicates % of full fusion and hemifusion events. treatment with abl kinase inhibitors could affect IBV S processing. imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 were adsorbed at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with IBV. cells were washed, fresh medium containing DMSO or drug was added. infection allowed to proceed for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C. Imatinib has several cellular targets, while GNF2 and GNF5 specifically inhibit the Abl kinases. supernatants were harvested 18 h post-infection, and a plaque assay was used to measure the viral titres of all samples. in excess of 1000 cells were analysed per experimental condition. the % of cells infected was calculated by comparing the number of infected cells to the total number of cells analysed. the error bars represent the standard error and P values were calculated using a paired t-test. imatinib and GNF2 reduced the titre by 80 %, and GNF5 reduced it by 70 %. we also observed a 70 % decrease in the total number of cells infected. pre-treatment occurred from t1 through t0, and adsorption occurred from t0 through t1. DMSO or imatinib was present in the infection medium during adsorption. results show that imatinib is a reversible inhibitor of Abl kinases. vero cells were pre-treated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with DMSO or imatinib. cells were washed, fresh medium containing DMSO or imatinib was added. infection was allowed to proceed for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C. in vero cells infected with IBV, we observed syncytia formation with an average of 22 nuclei per syncytium. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of nuclei per syncytium. imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5 inhibited syncytia formation induced by the S protein alone when expressed exogenously. treatment with all 3 drugs reduced the average to 3 nuclei per syncytium for both IBV S and SARS-CoV S. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 had no effect on the total number of cells expressing VSV-G after the transfection of a control plasmid. treatment with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 had no effect on the total number of cells expressing VSV-G after the transfection of a control plasmid (pCAGGS/VSV-G) the top images show an indirect immunofluorescence assay detecting IBV S (a) or SARS-CoV S (c) the graphs show the quantification of nuclei per syncytium for IBV S (b) or SARS-CoV S (d) in the presence of DMSO or drug. in excess of 50 syncytia were analysed in three independent experiments. full cell\u2013cell fusion results in both cells having cytoplasmic dsRed signal. fusion events were observed and categorized as full fusion or hemifusion. hemifusion events accounted for 14 % of all fusion events from control cells. IBV S, YFP-GPI and dsRed were detected 24 h later. surface YFP-GPI was labelled with mouse anti-IBV S and Cy5 anti-mouse IgG. surface YFP-GPI was labelled with rabbit anti-GFP and Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG. abl kinase inhibitors do not affect IBV S processing. vero cells were pre-treated for 1 h with DMSO or 10 M imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 at 37 \u00b0C. cells were adsorbed at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with IBV at an m.o.i. of 0.1. abl kinase inhibitors prevent syncytia formation induced by the S protein in the absence of other viral proteins. cleavage of S into S2 and S2\u2032 is not affected by imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5 suggesting that IBV S processing and cleavage is independent of Abl kinase activity. the distinct domains provide Abl kinases with the ability to act as scaffolds. it is likely that virus\u2013cell and cell\u2013cell fusion induced by the coronavirus S protein use the same or a very similar mechanism. cytoskeletal dynamics have been implicated in infection by several viruses [16\u201323] we did not observe an increase in hemifusion events after the treatment of IBV-infected cells with imatinib, GNF2 or GNF5. we favour the idea that virus interaction with host cell receptors induces actin rearrangements through Abl kinase activity. this brings cell membranes into close proximity to allow hemifusion followed by full fusion. current studies are underway to determine the abl kinase functions involved in coronavirus infection. mouse models, including that of the mouse hepatitis virus, can be used to test the in vivo antiviral effects of these drugs. nucleotides 111\u20131613 flanked by the BstxI and HindIII sites were PCR-amplified from a non-codon-optimized cDNA sequence previously cloned by reverse transcription PCR. nucleotides 1614\u20132955 flanked by the HindIII and XmaI sites were PCR-amplified from a cDNA vector. fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG obtained from Life Technologies.
