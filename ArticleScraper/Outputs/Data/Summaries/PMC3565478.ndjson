{"summary": "epistasis is thought to be important in evolution of host range [3,4]. it has been suggested that the sign of epistasis depends on environmental severity, switching from positive to negative as environments become stressful [5]. however, few studies have empirically examined this possibility. logical to expect that epistasis may vary depending on environmental severity. quantifying the extent to which G G E determines viral fitness is central to predicting the fate of viral genotypes across hosts. the ability of potato virus Y to infect resistant pepper plants depends on the alleles at the VPg and at the CI genes. solanaceae hosts show symptoms when infected; non-Solanaceae hosts do not. infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. RNA purification, virus fitness and epistasis estimation. infectious RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription of the corresponding plasmids. all plants were inoculated in a single block and at similar developmental stages. nine plants per host per virus genotype were rub-inoculated at first true leaf. epistasis between mutations x and y was calculated as xy = W00Wxy Wx0W0y, where W00, Wxy, Wx0, W0y stand for the fitness of wild-type, double and single mutants respectively. results first, we sought to determine whether the number of epistatic pairs was affected by the host species. sign epistasis means that the sign of the fitness effect of a mutation is conditional upon the state of another locus and vice versa. red numbers indicate significant changes in epistasis from the primary host (N. tabacum) to alternative ones (paired t-tests corrected for multiple comparisons; figure 1). in D. stramonium, epistasis became more negative in one case, less negative in three, more positive in one and less positive in four instances. in H. annuus, one case was significantly more negative than in tobacco and the less negative cases were the same as in D. stramonium. SLs are irrelevant in terms of evolutionary dynamics, we re-evaluated average epistasis after removing them. in this case, the average xy becomes significantly positive in N. tabacum (p = 0.036) but remains non-significant in the alternative hosts. this trend may be a spurious consequence of our reduced statistical power to detect small epistasis values. the results from these extra analyses confirm the significant G G E. 4. Discussion Our experiments show that the fitness value of a given mutation depends on the genotypic background wherein it appears and on the infected host. this observation has implications for predicting the fate of viral genotypes under different and variable environments and consequent for the development of successful antiviral strategies. may not provide the necessary resources at the right time, amount or location."}
