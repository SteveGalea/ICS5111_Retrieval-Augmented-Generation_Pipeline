{"summary": "the proposed method is based on weighted-projection matching in wavelet space. a hierarchical correlation matching method is also proposed. results show that a significant improvement is obtained for the initial orientation estimates of noisy virus images. the first step in a virus reconstruction is the detection and selection of the individual particle images from an electron micrograph. the first step in a virus reconstruction is the detection and selection of the individual particle images from a large area of an electron micrograph. in a high resolution structure determination, one would require over 6000 particles of data for 8.5 resolutions. in this technique, we propose a method for determining the initial orientations of the particles from low contrast (close-to-focus) images without necessity for a second set of highly defocused images. the wavelet-transformed images have the same size as the original images. a grid sampling of 0.5\u00b0 in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral particles was used. the number of projections obtained with this grid was relatively high. a match of the particle into the best 3 of the 200 classes was obtained using the wavelet correlation coefficient criterion. the same software as in [4] was used with the same initial parameters. the minimum radius was chosen to limit the maximum resolution expected from the reconstruction, here in the initial orientation the maximum radius corresponding to a resolution about 40. the red curve shows a resolution of about 14.5 of the reconstruction using 500 particles with orientations assigned by HWPM. the purple curve shows a resolution of about 14.5 of the reconstruction using 500 particles with orientations assigned by HWPM. HWPM was tested on a P22 empty shell capsid which was circular and whose shell is very thin (40 Angstrom) twenty micrographs of the P22 empty shell capsid with defocus range [0.5 to 2 m] were used for testing purpose. the total number of particles is 1340, each image has a size of 300 300 pixels. the surface view obtained from the ICL of the P22 empty shell capsid is different from the original P22 capsid. Fig. 7 proves the inaccuracy of some of the initial orientations obtained from the ICL method for such a smooth virus. focal pair method was used for 8.5 structure of HSV-1. it took about 6000 particles for a final reconstruction. the number of particles selected for the final reconstruction was about 40% of the original number of particles. the ICL method was able to give 40% of good orientations for the defocus range between 1.9 and 1.2 m. the data was noisy and had a very low contrast. the wavelet denoising in the HWPM also helped in reducing noise. wavelet multi-resolution analysis and processing improves particle detections [8], classification [15,16], and orientation determination on a variety of electron microscopy images which are highly noisy and have an extremely low contrast. this prove that wavelet techniques are adequate in the 3 main steps of 3D virus reconstruction and in the classification step of single particle reconstruction. the best wavelet base was the one which optimizes the signal to noise ratio in a broad spectrum of spatial frequencies. the bi-orthogonal wavelets basis [25-27] especially the 3.5 basis in Matlab-5 yielded the best average signal to noise ratio in the range of the spatial frequency. the wavelet correlation coefficient between two wavelet-transformed images, for a given level, is p. p is the number of components of wavelet decomposition. only an asymmetric triangle is needed in the case of an icosahedrally symmetric virus. each rectangle represents a class of projections. the closest projection to the center of the rectangle represents the center of the class. the classification gives the best tradeoff between speed and accuracy. the best choice for electron microscopic images is not clear. the problem is to represent typical signals with a small number of convenient functions. the majority of the wavelets basis existing in Matlab-5 software was tested. the wavelet correlation coefficient between two wavelet-transformed images is obtained by repeating the same filtering operations on the approximation. the weights given in this implementation are 0.75 for the approximation and 0.25 for the details. Fig. 3 shows the classification scheme applied for the icosahedral viruses. only an asymmetric triangle is needed in the case of an asymmetric object. each rectangle represents a class of projections. this work was supported by the national institutes of health and human frontier science program."}
