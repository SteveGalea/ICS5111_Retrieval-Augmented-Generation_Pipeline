{"summary": "the cytoplasm of E. coli often fails to provide the optimal environment for the folding of recombinant proteins. several approaches have been used to overcome this inherent problem. soluble-but-inactive proteins often remain biologically inactive. these proteins are present predominantly as aggregates rather than in mono-dispersed forms. this is particularly important to ensure the quality of purified proteins. results 2.1. Sonication Negatively Affects Protein Quality. hRID(2m)-fusion was used to regulate the formation of soluble aggregates. hRID(2m)-EGFP was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. chromophore-mature conformation has been reported to be quite stable. sonication resulted in two different bands, one with retarded migration (39 kDa) and the other with faster migration (32 kDa) sonication resulted in two different bands, one with retarded migration. the cell extract from a 500 mL E. coli culture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C with IPTG. hRID(2m)-EGFP in the soluble fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE without boiling. mild lysis, but not sonication, was able to enrich the levels of properly folded EGFP protein. these results also highlight the importance of screening properly folded proteins prior to downstream chromatographic purification steps. hRID(2m)-EGFP obtained by sonication or mild lysis was purified using Ni-affinity chromatography. the MW of SEC fractions 24 and 25 was estimated to be approximately 100 kDa. when SDS-PAGE was performed without boiling, SEC fractions 24 and 25 exhibited faster migration after both mild lysis and sonication. the migration velocity of SEC fraction 9 did not change after boiling, consistent with the results presented in Figure 1C. the size distribution of aggregates was monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) sonication could split pellet proteins into smaller, soluble aggregates that resisted precipitation by centrifugation. the mild lysis pellet fraction was suspended in buffer, sonicated (72 s), centrifuged at rotor speeds corresponding to 4000, 10,000, and 15,000 g. recombinant RS-SPARC protein remained soluble (>95%) after sonication. soluble yield was lower (25%) after mild lysis. recombinant RS-SPARC fusion protein predominantly bound the Ni-affinity matrix. high quality RS-SPARC was purified by mild lysis. expression of RS-SPARC in E. coli was incubated at 25 \u00b0C. lysate obtained by mild lysis was sonicated before SDS-PAGE analysis. sonication increases quality of RS-SPARC, while sonication increases incorrectly folded soluble RS-SPARC aggregates. hRID(2m)-fusion was used to regulate the formation of soluble aggregates. sonication are known to promote protein aggregation. there was no significant difference in the relative fluorescence units (RFUs) despite there being a higher amount of soluble protein in the sonicated sample. the folding quality of EGFP in the soluble fraction after sonication was poorer than after mild lysis. sonication decreases hRID(2m)-EGFP quality by increasing incompletely folded hRID(2m)-EGFP. the cell extract made either by sonication or mild lysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE without boiling. both a Coomassie-stained image and a fluorescence image are shown. peaks with slight enrichment of the later fraction (blue box) and mild lysis enriched the earlier fraction (red box) the purified proteins from both fractions were a similar size to those observed by SDS-PAGE, but again only the earlier fraction was fluorescent (Figure 2B,C). these results confirm and further extend the observations shown in Figure 1 that mild lysis, but not sonication, was able to enrich the levels of properly folded EGFP protein. void volume suggests that the protein is in the form of soluble aggregates of high molecular weight (MW) none of the corresponding fraction 9 from any of the three different preparations was fluorescent. MW of SEC fractions 24 and 25 was estimated to be approximately 100 kDa. mild lysis pellet fraction was subjected to sonication, with turbidity gradually decreasing in a time-dependent manner. sonication could split pellet proteins into smaller, soluble aggregates that resisted precipitation by centrifugation. we analyzed the effect of centrifugal force on the degree of protein precipitation. the soluble yield was lower (25%) after mild lysis. the soluble fraction was transferred to the soluble fraction (>95%) after sonication. the soluble yield was lower (25%) after mild lysis. the recombinant RS-SPARC prepared by mild lysis predominantly bound the Ni-affinity matrix. it is likely that exposure of the His-tag enabled binding to the affinity column. the smaller band (70kDa) was co-purified with the RS-SPARC fusion protein (90 kDa, arrow) was probably due to proteolytic cleavage near the fusion junction. the balance between dimers and multimeric oligomers differed significantly in the two samples when examined by SDS-PAGE. the presence of soluble oligomeric aggregates was a general phenomenon in the recombinant expression of target proteins. soluble aggregates of EGFP were intentionally formed using an RNA-binding defective solubility enhancer [14,26]. the physical properties, primarily solubility after centrifugation and the status of mono-dispersity/oligomerization determined by SEC, were compared with the functional (fluorescence) and biochemical properties represented by different migration velocities in SDS-PAGE. we found that the solubility of sonicated samples was far better than those obtained after mild lysis. soluble expression has always been favored, further highlighting the importance of soluble protein quality control. soluble expression has always been favored, further highlighting the importance of soluble protein quality control. molecular chaperones, chapernas, chapernas, chapernas, chapernas, recombinant proteins. molecular chaperones, chapernas, chapernas, chapernas, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants, recombinants plasmids pGE-hRID(2m)-6xhis-EGFP (hRID(2m)-EGFP) and pGE-LysRS-6xhis-SPARC (RS-SPARC) were transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLysE and BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli strains. a single colony was inoculated into 3 mL Luria-Bertani the suspended cells were sonicated or incubated at room temperature. they were separated into total, soluble, and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 12 min at 4 \u00b0C. the expression of target proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. the gel filtration column was equilibrated with two column volumes of buffer [50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 300 mM NaCl] the harvested cells were lysed using the mild lysis method. each tube was sonicated for 0, 6, 30, or 72 s. fragments were ligated into the pGE-LysRS plasmid [10] via BamHI/SalI sites. expression plasmids pGE-hRID(2m)-6xhis-EGFP (hRID(2m)-EGFP) and pGE-LysRS-6xhis-SPARC (RS-SPARC) were transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLysE and BL21(DE3)p the fluorescent protein bands and Coomassie Blue stained protein gels were imaged using a gel documentation system (InGenius3, SYNGENE, Frederick, MD, USA) the harvested cells were suspended in 10 mL B-PER and sonicated as previously described [24], or mildly lysed in 10 mL B-PER. the two different methods were compared. harvested cells were lysed using the mild lysis method. pellet was suspended in PBS and transferred to four e-tubes. each tube was sonicated for 0, 6, 30, or 72 s. each tube was sonicated for 0, 6, 30, or 72 s."}
