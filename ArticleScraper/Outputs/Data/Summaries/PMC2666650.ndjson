{"summary": "study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. falls must be examined with respect to local situations. results show multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations. the issue of old age, gender and history of falls are described as demographic factors that predispose the elderly to falls. a number of researchers claimed elderly women had a higher risk of sustaining an injurious fall but the findings of Fletcher and Hirdes said otherwise. the majority of fallers reported their underfoot accidents were caused by tripping or slipping on objects or uneven surfaces in these locations. fall assessment takes into account a patient's fall injury and medical problem while fall risk assessment diagnoses individual risk factors that occur simultaneously with the fall. the peak time pedestrian flow of mong Kok in 2007 reached 25,000 persons per hour [28]. the overwhelmingly crowded streets and sidewalks mean inadequate space for pedestrian movements and an increased risk of fall. the study involved patients attending the Kwong Wah Hospital. only outdoor cases (comprising of 123 and 158 useable records respectively from the pilot and second phases) were used in this study. all human-related research studies in Hong Kong must undergo a review of human research ethics. this study was exempted from the review of confidentiality because the interview was conducted with consent. the study made use of the agglomerative approach [36] to define clusters by grouping two closest incident locations into a cluster. the procedure will halt when the distance between centers of the clusters is greater than some defined threshold distance and minimum points per cluster. different cluster sizes of 3 to 5 and search radii of 50 m and 100 m were examined by Monte Carlo simulation. data collection exercise involved patients attending the Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH) because there is no official statistics on either the number or cause of falls within the population. the study included data on the location (open market, refuse collection points, bus stops, traffic lights) and circumstances of the fall incidents. all human-related research studies in Hong Kong must undergo a review of human research ethics. this study was exempted from the review of confidentiality because the interview was conducted with consent and the location of fall was in the outdoor. the nh is a constant-distance clustering routine that groups points on the basis of their spatial proximity. the procedure will halt when the distance between centers of the clusters is greater than some defined threshold distance and minimum points per cluster. different cluster sizes of 3 to 5 and search radii of 50 m and 100 m were examined by Monte Carlo simulation. 42% of the reported cases fell on a wet or slippery surface. only 1.4% was not sure about the causes of their falls. female Male TOTAL 20\u201344 45\u201364 > 64 Total 20\u201344 45\u201364 > 64 Total (n = 14) (n = 48) (n = 146) (n = 10) (n = 57) (n = 73) (n = 281) Environmental Cause Uneven floor 11 41 113 165 3 4 46 53 218 78 curb 1 6 10 13 15 2 0 3 5 20 7 Hit by wheelbarrow 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 Time of fall Midnight to 6 am 0 2 3 5 0 0 3 3 8 3 6 am to Noon 6 21 86 113 2 5 32 39 152 54 Noon to 6 pm 5 19 50 74 2 3 18 23 97 34 6 pm to Midnight 3 6 7 16 2 2 4 8 24 9 Weekend 2 11 55 68 2 1 18 21 89 32 Weekday 12 37 most falls occurred between 6 am and 12 noon, followed by 12 noon to 6 pm. most of falls occurred between 6 p.m. and 12 noon to 6 pm. most fall incidents occurred between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. the Nnh clustering method identifies a hot spot by grouping points of close proximity to each other. a hot spot as delimited using the SDE may imply an extent small in area coverage, but there is no rule of thumb for its size. an increase in the threshold distance has resulted in hot spots of a larger areal coverage. an increase in the threshold distance has resulted in a larger areal coverage. the exact location of problematic areas within a hot spot may be obscured. figure 4b shows that six of the eleven clusters involved elderly falls. Figure 4c shows that more females than males were involved in the fall hot spots while Figure 4d and Figure 4e show the multi-factorial nature of falls involving uneven, wet/slippery floors. 98.6% of outdoor falls were precipitated by one or more (not mutually exclusive) environmental causes such as uneven and wet or slippery floors. only 1.4% was not sure about the causes of their falls. ose bricks 1 2 6 9 0 0 4 4 13 5 Obstacle 2 4 16 22 0 0 5 5 27 10 Steps 1 2 11 14 0 0 6 6 20 7 Stairs 3 8 2 13 0 1 2 3 16 6 Uneven pavement 3 19 68 90 3 2 23 28 118 42 Slippery/Wet Floor 6 17 66 89 3 2 23 28 117 42 Any of above 1 10 54 65 1 0 17 18 83 30 Uncertain 107 38 High Heels 7 5 0 12 0 0 0 12 4 others 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 Hospitalization Yes 0 5 31 36 0 1 10 11 47 17 No 14 43 115 172 6 9 47 62 234 83 Use of assistive device Yes 0 3 55 58 0 0 23 23 81 29 No 14 45 91 150 6 10 34 50 200 71 Gait Stable 12 38 65 115 6 7 21 34 149 53 Un the majority of fall incidents occurred on a clear day. only 22% of the subjects fell on a rainy day. the majority or 45% of fallers wore sandals while a 4% minority had high heels. clusters drawn on a threshold distance of 50 meters using different minimum points per cluster. most of the clusters designated with SDEs are compact in shape. the size of the hot spots dictates the extent of the search areas to target site investigation. in a real cluster, fall cases occur in temporal and spatial proximity at a higher frequency than by chance. the simulation did not show which clusters were real but it provided a statistical basis to evaluate the number of clusters that did not occur purely by chance. the combination of 50 meters and a minimum of 4 or more points yields a significantly stable number of 11 real clusters. Figure 5a and Figure 5b collectively show that fall hot spots had a spatial-temporal dimension. figures 5a and Figure 5b highlight daytime versus nighttime hot spots of falls. elderly falls occurred mostly while walking without assistive device. visualization is an essential part in spatial epidemiology to discover new patterns that otherwise would have remained invisible in a conventional database table [37]. study demonstrates the use of Nnh and SDE techniques to detect hot spots of falls and to inspect possible environmental causes for falls. our spatial analysis helps to pinpoint the exact locations of wet/slippery or uneven ground. this approach is particularly helpful for locating problem spots within an outdoor market in Hong Kong. fall hot spots at busy street junctions coincide with pedestrian crossings. the multi-factorial nature of falls has been studied typically by statistical and correlation analyses of time-series data. there are limitations to what inferences can be made about mechanisms inducing falls from population time-series data alone."}
