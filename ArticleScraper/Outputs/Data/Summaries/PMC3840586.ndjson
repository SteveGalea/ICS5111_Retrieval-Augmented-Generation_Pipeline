{"summary": "211 patients suffering from early symptoms of the common cold were treated for seven days. application was performed three times daily with either a carrageenan-supplemented nasal spray or saline solution as placebo. primary endpoint was the time period of symptoms followed by all other days in the study period without symptoms. colds annually account for more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days. ARTI is among the ten most expensive illnesses in society [1]. etiological agents and antigenic variability has limited the possibility of creating an effective vaccine against the common cold. studies in vitro and in vivo have shown the effectiveness of carrageenan against several viruses such as hRV [27], influenza A [26] and RSV. symptomatic benefit and antiviral efficacy of a carrageenan-containing nasal spray has been shown in two randomized clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients with the common cold [29]. the study was performed in compliance with the ICH E6 Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practices (CPMP/ ICH/ 135/ 95/ 5) and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. written informed consent was obtained from each participant before enrolment into the study. each subject was randomised to one of the two groups according to a randomization schedule using random permuted blocks (block size of 4) the randomization list was prepared by a third party and was unblinded after trial review and data base lock. both investigators and patients were blinded to study treatment. 2.5 ml of 0.9% saline solution were instilled into each nostril. patients were then required to lean the head forward allowing saline to drip out of the nose into a collection cup. sample divided into 3 cryovials, labelled and stored at 80\u00b0C. only patients with a cold virus in the nasal cavity are likely to benefit from local antiviral treatment with iota-carrageenan. analysis of effectiveness was carried out for patients with laboratory confirmed cold virus infection (Figure 1). therefore, the intention-to-treat virus positive population (ITT) as well as the per protocol virus positive population (PP-VP) were assessed. this model transformed 10 TSS values (baseline and days 1\u20139) into a two line regression model. the average parameters of these two lines allowed the comparison of the course of the disease between the treatment groups irrespective of absolute TSS values. it was further reasoned that the model is less sensitive to absolute score values allowing the evaluation of different courses of disease independent of absolute values. study was performed in compliance with the ICH E6 Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practices (CPMP/ ICH/ 135/ 95/ 5) and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. study was a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) clinical trial. study procedures All patients were randomly assigned to receive either coldamaris prophylactic nasal spray containing carrageenan or saline solution (sodium chloride 9.0 g/l) nasal spray was administered three times daily into each nostril for 7 days. each subject was randomised according to randomization schedule using random permuted blocks (block size of 4) both investigators and patients were blinded to study treatment. a difference of less than 4.0 g was assessed as consumption less than 80% of study protocol. nasal wash fluid samples were obtained for virological analysis at baseline (day 1), at visit 2 (study days 3/4) and visit 3 (study days 10/11) using the following procedure. the primary efficacy parameter was changed from \u201cthe time period between first and last day with symptoms followed by 48 hours without symptoms\u201d to \u201cthe time period between first and last day with symptoms, followed by all other days without symptoms\u201d. analysis of effectiveness was carried out for patients with laboratory confirmed cold virus infection. previous trials suggested that TSS data might not be normally distributed and lopsided. this was confirmed for the actual study with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a test for lopsided distribution of data. prior to unblinding, it was decided to apply the analysis of ReWuMoD (regression with unknown model domain, Additional file 1: Figure S1) technique. 211 patients with suspected common cold were randomized with 203 completing treatment in the ITT population. reasons for patient exclusion were lost to follow-up (5 patients) and exclusion according to protocol (3 patients). none of the patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (Figure 1). 86** n % n % n % Smoking status Active smoker 36 35.3% 32 31.7% 0.59* 24 40.7% 17 28.8% 0.18* Passive smoker 25 24.5% 22 21.8% 0.65* 17 28.8% 13 22.0% 0.40* Active OR passive smoker 44 43.1% 40 39.6% 0.61* 30 50.8% 21 35.6% 0.09* Mean SD Mean SD SD Baseline TSS 6.3 2.0 6.4 1.9 0.56** recovery in iota-carrageenan treated patients compared to placebo in the PP-VP population with an estimated duration of disease of 11.6 days (95% confidence interval [CI]; 10.4-12.9 days) in the carrageenan group compared to 13.7 days (95% CI; 12.2-15.1 days) in the placebo group. the number needed to treat NNT was 19.6 (95% CI; -0.24-0.14) in the ITT population (N = 203) no statistical significance for the duration of disease was observed. in the ITT population (N = 203) no statistical significance for the duration of disease was observed. the mean daily rate of TSS reduction was calculated from the variable a2 that was determined by ReWuMod analysis. in the ITT-VP population, 39 patients (33%) had re-appearing symptoms. this difference between the groups was significant with a p-value of 0.031. between days 1 and days 3 or 4 determined with quantitative real time PCR for a set of respiratory viruses. the black bar shows Iota-Carrageenan and the grey bar shows placebo. no statistically significant differences were found between the study groups. the virus positive populations consisted of 118 patients in the ITT-VP and 103 patients in PP-VP groups. the ITT population comprised 110 females (59 placebo and 51 carrageenan) and 93 males (42 placebo and 51 carrageenan) the mean age was 33.3 years in the placebo and 33.7 years in the carrageenan group. 118/203 (58.1%) patients in the ITT population had a laboratory confirmed infection with at least one common cold virus, with no significant difference in virus distribution between the groups. influenza virus B, and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 2 were not detected in any of the patients. all symptoms were defined as the time until complete absence of cold symptoms followed by all other days in the study period without cold symptoms. the relative risk for iota-carrageenan treated PP-VP patients to reduce the symptoms for 1 day was 1.24 (95% CI; 0.88-1.73) the absolute risk reduction (ARR) was 0.13 (95% CI; -0.32-0.08) in the ITT-VP population the break point was achieved in the carrageenan group 0.5 days earlier. this was followed by a significant faster reduction of symptom intensity in the carrageenan group. similar results were also observed in PP-VP patients. 39 patients (33%) had re-appearing symptoms (25 placebo patients and 14 carrageenan patients) this difference between the groups was significant with a p-value of 0.031. the number of patients taking medications for common cold symptoms was low (less than 17% in total) the study treatment was well tolerated and no statistically significant differences were found between the study groups regarding the total number or distribution of AEs. 43 AEs (related or not related) were reported, involving 38 subjects (19 subjects in each treatment group) in the trial. sufficient use of study medication when a reduction of dosage of more than 20% corresponding to 1.5 days of treatment was documented. the primary endpoint was changed during the course of the study, prior unblinding and with approval of the ethics committee based on results of an earlier study in children. the results reported are limited to patients tested positive with real-time PCR, which is 58% of the study population. no significant effect on the primary endpoint in the ITT population was observed in this trial in contrast to the virus positive population that comprised 58% virus positive patients. a recent study in children with a similar design revealed a significant reduction of time to disease clearance of 1.8 days in the ITT population. the rate of symptom reduction per day was approximately doubled. the results are in line with data from a trial conducted in adults. carrageenan treated patients reported a greater reduction in TSS than placebo patients, resulting in a significant clinical benefit. iota-carrageenan treated patients in the ITT-VP smoke exposed population showed an estimated duration of disease of 10.0 days. compared to 13.6 days (95% CI; 10.9-16.3 days) in the placebo group. study was neither designed nor powered to demonstrate the effect in this particular subgroup. the use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of viral load in nasal fluids. iota-carrageenan may be a good alternative treatment for viral infections. slope of line 2 represents the rate of improvement during the later phase of the disease. the work was supported in part by a grant from Austrian Science Promotion Agency."}
