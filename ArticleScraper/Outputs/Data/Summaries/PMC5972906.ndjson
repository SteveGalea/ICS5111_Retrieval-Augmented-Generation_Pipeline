{"summary": "the human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a member of the polyomaviridae family. it infects 50 to 80% of healthy individuals and causes an asymptomatic, lifelong, persistent infection in the kidneys (1, 2). in immunosuppressed individuals, JCPyV can become reactivated in the central nervous system (3, 4) and cause an uncontrolled lytic infection in glial cells, astrocytes and oligodend JCPyV infection is initiated via attachment to 2,6-linked sialic acid on lactoseries tetrasaccharide c (LSTc) through viral protein 1 (VP1), the major viral capsid protein (16\u201318). the sialic acid receptor has been demonstrated to specifically mediate viral attachment (16\u201318). CPyV requires tyrosine kinase activity for infection, as genistein blocks infection. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is phosphorylated 15 min following infection (20), a time consistent with viral attachment and entry events (22) ERK phosphorylation was shown to be sustained for 6 h following infection (20) RNA viruses have been reported to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway. in some cases use it for infectivity (33), including members of the polyomaviridae family. mouse polyomavirus activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (34, 36) but does not require activation of the MAPK pathway for infection (36) RESULTS Inhibition of ERK blocks JCPyV infection in glial cells. cells expressing the ERK1/2 siRNA showed a 97% decrease in JCPyV infection compared to cells expressing a control siRNA. ERK activity is not required for infection of the closely related polyomavirus SV40. the efficacy of the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 in SVG-A cells was analyzed through Western blot analysis of cellular levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) treatment of cells with PD98059 decreased levels of pERK, yet U0126 resulted in a more significant decrease, suggesting that U0126 is a more effective inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation in SVG-A cells. infected cells were scored by indirect immunofluorescence using a VP1-specific antibody that recognizes both JCPyV and SV40 VP1. data represent the percentage of JCPyV or SV40-infected VP1+ cells per visual field normalized to the number of DAPI+ cells per field for triplicate samples. infectivity was scored by quantitating nuclear VP1 expression. data represent the average number of infected cells per visual field for five 10 fields of view for triplicate samples. error bars indicate SDs. SVG-A cells were infected with JCPyV (MOI = 1 FFU/cell) for the specified duration. the percentage of pERK was determined using antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and total ERK (protein control) in order to determine how ERK inhibition impacts the JCPyV life cycle, SVG-A cells were treated with the ERK inhibitor U0126. ERK inhibition led to an 75% decrease when cells were pretreated with the ERK inhibitor for 1 h prior to infection. this treatment is consistent with the time frame in which the most robust ERK phosphorylation is noted. treatment of cells with U0126 had no effect on viral attachment in comparison to that with DMSO-treated SVG-A cells. ERK inhibition does not affect virus binding to the cell surface. fixed samples were either fixed or incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. the virus was internalized at 90 min postinfection and was protected from TB treatment. a 1-log decrease in protected fluorescence in samples incubated at 37\u00b0C was observed. ERK inhibition affects the JCPyV infectious cycle at a posttrafficking step. ERK inhibition affects the JCPyV infectious cycle at a posttrafficking step. cells were fixed and stained for VP1 expression at days 4 and 7. ERK inhibition blocks viral promoter activity in SVG-A cells treated with the ERK inhibitor U0126. ERK inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in early and late promoter activities as measured by luciferase production. inhibition of ERK reduces viral promoter activity, indicating that inhibition of ERK reduces viral promoter activity. cells were assayed for luciferase production, indicative of viral promoter activity, by luminometry. data represent the average relative luciferase units produced from triplicate samples normalized to TK Renilla luciferase expression. ERK inhibition blocks JCPyV infection in kidney cells. inhibition of ERK in RPTECs resulted in 40% decrease in JCPyV infectivity. together, these data suggest that the MAPK-ERK cascade is required for JCPyV infection of both kidney and glial cell types. ERK pathway is necessary for expression of the viral early gene encoding T antigen. cells expressing an ERK1/2 siRNA showed an 85% decrease in T-antigen expression compared to that in cells expressing a control siRNA. RPTECs treated with the ERK inhibitor U0126 showed a significant decrease in T-antigen production as measured by indirect immunofluorescence. ERK inhibition decreases viral gene expression. phosphorylated ERK can initiate transcription and subsequent gene expression. ERK silencing in HEK293A-5-HT2AR cells resulted in 74- and 51-fold decreases in viral gene expression. ERK activation is a positive regulator of JCPyV gene expression in both kidney and glial cell types. cells were treated with either an ERK1/2 or EGFR (CTL) siRNA for 48 h and then infected with JCPyV (MOI = 1 FFU/cell), fed with appropriate media, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 bind to MEK1 and MEK2. treatment with PD98059 also reduced JCPyV infection by 75%. however, PD98059 had no effect on SV40 infection in SVG-A cells. gene silencing of ERK reduces JCPyV infection in SVG-A cells. cells were either harvested for analysis of ERK protein expression (A) or infected (B) at 48 h posttransfection, cells were either harvested for analysis of ERK protein expression (A) or infected (B) cells were infected with PD98059 (A and B) or U0126 (C and D) at the indicated concentrations or DMSO at an equivalent volume (of maximum inhibitor concentration) and then infected with JCPyV (MOI = 0.1 FFU/cell) (A and C) or SV40 (MOI = 0.001 FFU/cell) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the phosphorylated ERK signal waned after 12 h, with only a minor increase in the pERK signal at 72 h postinfection. these data suggest that ERK is activated early during infection. this suggests that the rapid ERK activation is not sustained later steps in the viral life cycle. cells were washed with medium and then incubated in media with inhibitors. at specified time point, medium was removed, cells were washed, complete medium was added, and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. infectivity was scored by quantitating nuclear VP1 expression. activation coincident with timing of viral attachment and entry. ligand binding to the 5-HT2Rs, which are required for JCPyV entry, can activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. this regulates receptor cell surface expression, endocytosis, and activation of other signaling pathways. ERK inhibition does not affect virus binding to the cell surface. trypan blue (TB) quenching assay was used to measure viral internalization by flow cytometry (22) to determine if ERK activation impacts virus entry. trypan blue (TB) quenching assay was used to measure viral internalization by flow cytometry. ERK inhibition affects the JCPyV infectious cycle at a posttrafficking step. cells were fixed (attachment) or transferred to 37\u00b0C for 90 min. samples were gated to remove cellular debris. at either 4 or 7 days posttransfection, cells were fixed and stained using a VP1-specific antibody and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for infectivity. data are representative of the number of infected cells per visual field for five 10 fields of view for triplicate samples. SVG-A cells were pretreated with U0126 (10 M) or DMSO (1:1,000) for 4 h. subsequently transfected with luciferase-expressing plasmids containing the JCPyV Mad-1 prototype strain early (A) or late (B) promoters and a thymidine kinase (TK) Renilla luciferase plasmid. HEK293A-5-HT2AR cells treated with U0126 showed 50% decrease in JCPyV infection compared to that of cells treated with DMSO. inhibition of ERK in RPTECs resulted in 40% decrease in JCPyV infectivity. ERK activity is also required for JCPyV infection in primary kidney cell lines. infectivity was scored by quantitating nuclear T-antigen expression. data represent the percentage of DAPI+ cells per field for five 20 fields of view. samples were normalized to the DMSO-treated control cells (100%) RPTECs treated with the ERK inhibitor showed a significant decrease in T-antigen production. these data suggest that inhibition of ERK activation impacts the production of T antigen and possibly the initiation of viral JCPyV transcription. ERK activation is a positive regulator of JCPyV gene expression in both kidney and glial cell types. ERK silencing in ERK-A and HEK293A-5-HT2AR cells resulted in 74- and 51-fold decreases in viral gene expression. ERK activation is induced immediately upon viral infection. inhibition of ERK within the first 4 h of viral infection resulted in a significant decrease in infection. inhibition of ERK activation had no effect on viral attachment, entry, or trafficking. changes in early gene expression suggest that ERK is a positive regulator of JCPyV transcription in both kidney and glial cell types. MAPK-ERK signaling controls the activation of transcription factors necessary for cellular growth, proliferation, and cell death. this functionality is usurped by JCPyV during infection to promote viral propagation. 5-HT2Rs are required for JCPyV entry (19), and ligand activation of 5-HT2Rs and subsequent endocytosis can activate the MAPK-ERK pathway (51) the 5-HT2Rs induce MAPK-ERK signaling through the action of tyrosine kinases (31, 52, 53) which activate protein kinase C (PKC) (54), stimulating GTPase Ras binding to the serine/threonine binding to sialic acid receptors could also activate the MAPK pathway. inhibition of ERK does not alter virus binding or entry. signaling through this pathway is not required for infection. SV40 polyomavirus has not been reported to directly activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. it activates a MAPK-ERK-independent signaling pathway that induces Ca2+ mobilization and tyrosine kinase activity of PKC. however, the fact that ERK is activated immediately upon JCPyV infection. ERK phosphorylation continues through 12 h.p.i. in a multiphasic pattern that diminishes and eventually stabilizes over the course of infection. ERK is required early in the infectious process to accumulate the transcription factors necessary for viral transcription and replication. inhibition of ERK leads to a reduction of viral progeny, thereby limiting viral spread (67\u201369) viruses usurp the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway to drive various aspects of the virus life cycle through unique mechanisms. additional effects on the infectious life cycle should be further elucidated given the range of effects discovered with other viruses.
