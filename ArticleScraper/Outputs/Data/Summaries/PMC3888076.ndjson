{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) marked the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the IHR. the IHR (2005) have successfully solidified the recent shift from disease- to event-based surveillance, thereby improving event detection and rapid response. the success of the IHR in the next half-decade will depend on States parties consistently meeting their core capacities requirements for surveillance and response. the graph also shows time differences for outbreaks reported in the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News before and after the IHR 2005 officially went into effect. only the time difference between outbreak start and outbreak detection was statistically significant. the role of the state has quietly shifted. some countries have each sought to combine public health expertise into a unified national public health institute [8, 9] but governments risk growing complacent. attention on the IHR (2005) has faded and funding has diminished due to the global financial crisis. fewer than 50% of reporting countries have a capacity score >75%. the focus on the IHR (2005) has been on surveillance and reporting."}
