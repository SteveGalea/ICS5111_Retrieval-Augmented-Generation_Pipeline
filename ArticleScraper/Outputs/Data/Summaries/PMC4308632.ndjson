UPLC analysis was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC instrument (Waters Corporation, MA, USA) gradient program was designed as follows: 0\u201311 min, 5\u201335% B; 11\u201318 min, 35\u201355% B; 18\u201322 min, 55\u201375% B; 22\u201324 min, 75\u201390% B; 24-25 min, 90\u2013100% B; and 25\u201330 min, 100% B. full scan mass spectra data were acquired in positive and negative ion modes. a mixed stock solution was prepared by adding a suitable volume of each stock solution to a 5 mL flask and diluted with 30% methanol-water solution. the lowest concentration of the mixture stock solution was further diluted to give a series of different concentrations for investigating the limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) of the 12 chemical constituents. DAD method was evaluated with linearity, LOD, LOQ, precision, stability, repeatability, and recovery tests. the calibration curves were constructed with five different concentrations of chemical markers in triplicate. the samples were analyzed by six repetitive injections within one day and once a day for three successive days. lidroside 1726.28 1701.25 1622.02 1522.31 1701.25 1656.32 1711.54 1701.25 1688.54 Chlorogenic acid 2444.97 2492.15 2216.89 2285.43 2492.15 2289.27 2492.62 2492.15 2552.17 Forsythoside E 1583.93 1620.78 451.91 1462.09 1620.78 1402.53 1627.01 1620.78 15 cExtraction solvent multiples: 1 : 50, 1 : 100, and 1 : 200 times per gram of sample. methanol-0.1% formic acid aqueous solution as mobile phase with column temperature at 50\u00b0C could obtain the best chromatographic peak shape. 61 compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified by comparing the retention times and accurate mass measurement with references or literature data. these compounds were divided into six types according to their structural characteristics including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, anthraquinones, triterpenoids, iridoids, and other types. 707.1830 [2M\u2013H] 191.0497 [M\u2013H\u2013Ca], 179.0312 [Caffeic acid\u2013H\u2013CO2] Neochlorogenic acid [13] 5 a 3.639 254 C16H24O10 375.1302 (2.9), 751.2667 [2M\u2013H] 213.0773 [M\u2013H\u2013Glc], 151.0878 [M\u2013H\u2013Glc\u2013CO2\u2013H2O], 179.0348 [Caffeic acid\u2013H], 173.0461 [Quinic acid\u2013H\u2013H2O], 191.0417 [M\u2013H\u2013Ca] Cryptochlorogenic acid [18] 10 6.435 270 C17H26O10 389.1096 (3.1) 391.2176 (0.8) 413.1067 395.2354 [M + Na\u2013H2O]+ 229.0835 [M + H\u2013Glc]+ Loganin [19 106 306 C20H22O8 389.1458 (2.6), 435.1519 [M + HCOO] 227.0943 [M\u2013H\u2013Glc] Polydatin [22] 16 8.222 C29H36O16 639.2219 (1.7) 477.1894 [M\u2013H\u2013Glc], 179.0546 [M\u2013Rha\u2013C17H14O6], 161.0328 [Glc\u2013H\u2013H2O], + Liquiritin [25] 22 a 9.886 277, 312 C26H30O13 549.1627 (3.5) 551.2823 (4.7) 573.1737 257.0822 [M + H\u2013Api\u2013Glc]+ Liquiritin apioside [26] 23 9.995 C26H30O13 549.1629 (3.8) 551.3403 (5.1) 573.1735 257.0815 [M + H\u2013A 633.1404 465.0982 [M + H\u2013Rha]+ 303.0495 [M + H\u2013Rha]+ Rutin [31] 30 a 11.220 280 C29H36O15 623.2001 (1.6) 461.1920 [M\u2013H\u2013Ca], 161.0328 [Caffeic acid\u2013H\u2013H2O] 647.1927 163.0386 [Caffeic acid\u2013H\u2013H2O]+ Forsytho 35 a 13.082 276 C15H12O4 255.0654 (1.2) 257.0659 (0.8) 147.0621 [M + H\u2013RL]+, 137.0422 [M + H\u2013VP]+, 119.0691 [M + H\u2013RL\u2013CO]+ Liquiritigenin [34] 36 a 13.251 243, 372 C26H30O13 549.1621 (2.4) 551.1725 (3.4) 5 c+, 355.1544 [M + H\u2013Glc\u2013H2O]+ Phillyrin [37, 38] 40 14.678 372, 255 C15H10O7 301.0355 (2.3) 151.0137 [M\u2013H\u2013C8H6O3] 303.0520 (4.9) Quercetin [39] 41 15.039 284 C28H34O15 609.1522 (1.3) 301.0582 [M\u2013H\u2013Ru Isoliquiritigenin [26] 47 a 18.385 250, 304 C16H12O4 267.0653 (1.5) 269.0827 (4.8) 291.0751 Formononetin [42] 48 18.804 895.4082 (2.8) 719.3849 [M\u2013H\u2013GlcA] 351.0630 [2GlcA\u2013H] 897.4107 (1.2) 919.3925 22-Acetoxy licorice [44] 52 20.000 254 C44H64O18 879.4062 (1.3) 351.0806 [M\u2013H\u201322AG] 881.4170 (0.1) 705.3897 [M + H\u2013GlcA]+, 529.3588 [M + H\u20132GlcA\u2013H2O]+ 22-Acetoxyglycyrrhizin [42] 53 20.573 352 C17H14O7 329.2341 635 [M\u2013H\u2013CO\u2013CH2O\u2013CO2], 221.0221 [M\u2013H\u2013CO\u2013CH2O\u20132CO2] 369.1369 (7.6) 391.1176 Glycycoumarin [47] 57 22.087 249 C42H62O16 821.3977 (1.7) 803.4501 [M\u2013H\u2013H2O], 759.4542 [M\u2013H\u2013H2O\u2013CO2], 645.4102 [M\u2013H\u2013G [M\u2013H\u2013GA] 809.4410 (0.9) 831.4138 Licorice saponin B2 [49] 60 22.623 252 C42H62O16 821.3997 (0.2) 351.0837 [M\u2013H\u2013GA] 823.4105 (1.3) 845.3900 647.3838 [M + H\u2013GlcA]+, 471.3288 [M + H\u20132GlcA\u2013H2O]+ Licorice sapon flavonoids seventeen flavonoids in LQC were identified. they were obtained from Lianqiao, Jinyinhua, Gancao, and Mahuang. flavone aglycones gain fragment ions by the reverse Diels-Alder reaction. compound 35 (a), compound 26 (b), compound 8 (c), compound 30 (d), compound 39 (e), compound 61 (f), compound 45 (g), compound 57 (h), and compound 5 (i) in negative ion mode, phenylpropionic acids have similar fragmentation pathways of simultaneous or successive loss of H2O (18 Da), CO (28 Da), and CO2 (44 Da). m/z 371.1826 and m/z 356.1547 produced characteristic fragments at m/z 371.1826 and m/z 356.1547 corresponding to [M\u2013H\u2013Glc (glucose)] and [M\u2013H\u2013Glc\u2013CH3], respectively. compilers 16, 18, 19, 28, 32, 38, and 56 were tentatively identified on the basis of the exact molecular formulae matching. triterpenoids eight triterpenoids in LQC were unambiguously or tentatively identified. all of them were derived from Gancao. representative compound 57 yielded [M\u2013H\u2013H2O\u2013CO2] at m/z 759.4524. m/z 151.0878, [M\u2013H\u2013Glc\u20132CO2] at m/z 125.0712, and [1,4F\u2013H2O] at m/z 93.0423 [52], as presented in Figure 4(i).
