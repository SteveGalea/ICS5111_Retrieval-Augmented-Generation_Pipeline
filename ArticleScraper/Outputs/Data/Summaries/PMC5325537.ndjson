{"summary": "the results obtained in children (15 years old) by multiplex-PCR (mPCR) tests were also compared with RSV specific detection. all repeated samples for the same children in the same month were discarded. new multiplex PCR tests allow a fast detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses [1] including recently described viruses as human metapneumovirus [2], human bocavirus [3] and coronavirus NL63 [4] or HKU1 [5] Molecular tests also changed the understanding of some older respiratory viruses group such as for rhinovirus. despite these new knowledges only a few respiratory viruses have been well established as highly pathogenic. both studies were conducted during a single winter season. the first study was conducted in caen teaching hospital during the particular winter season 2009\u20132010. the second study was conducted in Toulouse teaching hospital during the winter season 2010\u20132011 in children attending the emergency unit. all our hospitals are located in northern Paris area. an oral consent from the patient or parent was collected at admission in hospital. no specific application to regulatory authorities was required. patients were stratified into several age groups: 0\u20136 months-old, 6\u201336 months-old and 3\u201315 years-old. results from the 0\u20136 months-old were also analysed according to the prescribing units divided in two categories. comparisons were performed using exact Fisher tests with the R software v3.2.2. all these tests were not able to differentiate rhinovirus and enterovirus. so, they were grouped as picornavirus (rhinovirus + enterovirus) for our analysis. the children median age at inclusion was 3.2 months [IQR] = 0.8\u201323.7], 48.8% were female. global positivity rate was 51.4% (196 samples), 9.2% (35 samples) corresponded to viral co-infections. no patient was included a second time if there is less than 30 days since the previous sample. Fig 1. Positivity rates obtained by multiplex PCR and RSV specific immunchromatographic tests according to age and medical units. adenoviruses were more frequent in children between 6 and 36 months old than in all other patients. the most frequent viral group was picornavirus in both populations but was more represented in neonatology than in paediatric units (78.0 vs 54.1%) the most frequent viral group was picornavirus in both populations. prevalence among older children with prevalence at 16.2% of all identified viruses in the 0\u20136 months and 3\u201315 years strata. the adenovirus group had a slight tendency to be more frequently identified in the 6\u201336 months group (18.9%) compared to the 0\u20136 months and 3\u201315 years groups (5.4 and 9.6%, respectively, p = 0.09) the proportion of each virus group identified in viral co-infections was statistically different between virus groups (p = 0.02). only adenovirus presented a statistically higher proportion of viruses identified among such coinfections than in other viral groups (p = 0.02) children presenting negative RSV-IC test, 43 were also tested by mPCR in the same 2 days period. sixteen (33.3%) were positive by mPCR and 4 displayed viral co-infections. mPCR were more frequently positive among children in paediatric units. global positivity rate was 51.4% (196 samples), 9.2% (35 samples) corresponded to viral co-infections. the identified viruses were picornavirus (n = 125, 52.7%), adenovirus (26, 11.0%), parainfluenza (17, 7.2%), metapneumovirus (14, 5.9%), coronavirus (13, 5.5%), influenza (8, 3.4%) and bocavirus (8, 5.2% of all identified viruses with Respi the total number of isolated viruses is indicated at the top of each bar. adenoviruses were more frequent in children between 6 and 36 months old than in all other patients. influenza was also very low for all children strata but highly frequent among adults. most frequent viral group was picornavirus in both populations but was more represented in neonatology than in paediatric units (78.0 vs 54.1%) this higher representation of picornavirus group may be explained by the asymptomatic carriage of such viruses. the adenovirus group had a slight tendency to be more frequently identified in the 6\u201336 months group (18.9%) compared to the 0\u20136 months and 3\u201315 years groups (5.4 and 9.6%, respectively, p = 0.09). During their respective epidemic periods, RSV and influenza always encountered for 10 to 40% and 10 to 50% of all viruses identified in our laboratory. two virus groups presented a statistically lower level of viral co-infections compared to all other viral groups. only adenovirus presented a statistically higher proportion of viruses identified among such coinfections than in other viral groups. the mPCR test has been done specifically on physician request. 36 (83.7%), 6 (14.0%) and 1 (2.3%) were belonging to the 0\u20136, 6\u201336 and >36 months old respectively. mPCR were more frequently positive among children in paediatric units (7/11, 63.6%) rather than neonatology (4/25, 16.0%, p = 0.007) in paediatric units, influenza and RSV were never the majority group of viruses identified in our study in all children age strata. even during the specific RSV epidemic period only 28.6 and 31.3% of children in paediatric units were positive for any other respiratory viruses. bocaviruses were not detected by two of our mPCR kits, representing 51.2% of all tested samples. this virus group is rare in France and was only detected in 8 samples (5.2% of all samples tested with Respifinder\u00ae 22) detection of all respiratory viruses already allows to a better understanding of viral epidemics at a local and a global scale. study highlights the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in france. mPCR gives better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings."}
