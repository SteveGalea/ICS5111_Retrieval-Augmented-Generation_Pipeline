{"summary": "retroviruses must fuse with host cell membranes in order to gain entry and initiate infection. the process is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) acquired from viral producer cells. the TM subunit contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for interactions with specific cellular receptors or coreceptors. infection by ecotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV) has been shown to be blocked by inhibitors of cellular cathepsins [21], suggesting host proteases are involved in the fusion activation of E-MLV. XMRV is a gammaretrovirus that was originally identified from human prostate cancer patients. the XMRV Env protein of XMRV mediates membrane fusion and cell entry from the virology perspective. it is important to understand the mechanisms of retroviral Env-mediated fusion activation and cell entry from the virology perspective. XMRV has been shown to infect a wide range of cell lines derived from different species including humans. XMRV entry is pH-independent and does not require host proteases. HTX cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of (A) ammonium chloride, (B) Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), (C) leupeptin or (D) cathep. XMRV entry is pH-independent and does not require host proteases. sin III inhibitor for 1 h infected with moMLV pseudotypes encoding GFP and bearing XMRV Env, MLV 10A1 Env, VSV-G or Ebola GP. percentage of GFP-expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry 48 h post-infection and normalized to the infection obtained in the absence of drug set to 100%. soluble form of XMRV SU fused to the human IgG Fc fragment. fusion protein was produced by transfection of 293T cells and purified using protein A beads. similar results were also obtained in the permissive human 293, DU145, A549, dog MDCK, and monkey Vero cells. indicated cell lines were incubated with 5 g of XMRV SU-hIgG Fc for 4 h. binding was measured using anti-human IgG FITC and flow cytometry. 2 34 CT606 2 2 293/GP-LAPSN cells were transfected with plasmids encoding individual XMRV Envs. virions were harvested 48\u201372 h post-transfection, and used to infect CHO and CHO/XPR1 cells expressing XPR1. results were repeated three times, with similar titers obtained. truncation of XMRV Env from the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail promotes SU shedding and syncytia-forming activity. 293T cells were pulse-labeled with [35-S] Met-Cys for 1 h. the XMRV Env proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. CT624 showed a wildtype level of expression whereas all other truncation mutants had reduced SU on the cell surface (50%) truncation of XMRV Env induces SU shedding and surface expression. 293 cells were chosen because they are highly transfectable and also permissive to XMRV infection. the full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation, presumably due to the presence of an R peptide in the CT. CT624 and CT613, respectively, elicited apparent syncytia. truncation of XMRV Env in the CT activates its fusion activity. 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated XMRV Env. XMRV SU (2 g) was bound to cells for 4 h at 4\u00b0C, stained with anti-human IgG FITC. syncytia induction can be observed in cells expressing XMRV Env truncation mutants. the effector 293T/GFP cells were transfected with Env-encoding plasmids. the target 293 cells were labeled with a red-fluorescent dye, CMTMR. truncation at the putative R-peptide cleavage site or further upstream towards the MSD induced apparent cell- effector 293T/GFP cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmid DNA encoding individual truncated Envs. we determined their cell-cell fusion activities and SU surface expression in parallel. the fusion profiles of CT624 and CT613 were almost identical. XMRV Env surface expression was measured by flow cytometry using an anti-FLAG antibody. the obtained fusion percentages were plotted against Env surface expression. a representative experiment with standard errors of triplicate samples is shown (n = 3). the CHO/XPR1 cell line was established by transducing CHO cells with a LXSN retroviral vector encoding XPR1 [33] expression of XPR1 in the CHO/XPR1 cell line was demonstrated by the specific binding of soluble XMRV SU fusion protein to those cells. titers of XMRV wildtype and CT truncation mutants in these two cell lines were shown in Table 1. the fusion activities of XMRV Env and mutants in CHO and CHO/XPR1-expressing cells were then examined. for this purpose, we labeled CHO or CHO/XPR1 cells with CMTMR, and co-cultured them with the effector 293T/GFP cells expressing XMRV Env. the full length XMRV Env exhibited approximately 2104 infectious units per ml for both vectors. the titers of MoMLV retroviral pseudotypes harbouring CT635 or CT624 were slightly reduced as compared to that of the wildtype Env (4\u20136 fold) the other more severely truncated mutants exhibited a 23-log decrease in the infectious titer (Table 2). titers of pseudoviral infection for CT624 and CT613 did not correlate with their enhanced Env fusogenicity based on the syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion assays. this was particularly the case for CT613, which showed a strongly enhanced fusogenicity but a much reduced titer relative to the wildtype Env. GP_LAPSN cells were transfected with an XMRV Env-encoding plasmid. XMRV entry is pH-independent and does not require cellular proteases. retroviruses have been historically believed to fuse directly at the plasma membrane of target cells for entry and infection. XMRV entry is pH-independent and does not require host proteases. HTX cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of (A) ammonium chloride, (B) Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), (C) leupeptin or (D) cathepsin III inhibitor for 1 h and infected with moMLV pseudotypes encoding GFP. both protease inhibitors are broad spectra, lysosomal protease inhibitors. XMRV infection was enhanced by both protease inhibitors. however, infection of Ebola pseudovirions was dramatically impaired. XMRV SU binds to cells expressing the viral entry receptor, XPR1, and blocks XMRV pseudovirion infection. similar results were also obtained in the permissive human 293, DU145, A549, dog MDCK, and monkey Vero cells. AP foci were counted 72 h post-infection and values were normalized to infection in the absence of soluble protein set to 100%. virions were harvested 48\u201372 h post-transfection and used to infect CHO and CHO/XPR1 cells expressing XPR1. soluble XMRV SU fusion protein blocks XMRV pseudoviral infection. soluble XMRV SU fusion protein blocks XMRV pseudoviral infection. soluble XMRV SU fusion protein interacts with the XPR1 receptor on the cell surface. XMRV Env proteins in the cell lysates and their SU shed into the culture media were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads (FLAG is tagged at the N-terminus of SU) all the Env constructs were properly processed and expressed in the transfected cells except CT635 which consistently showed a decreased level of expression of the processed SU. v proteins in cells lysates and shed were immunoprecipated, resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. the expression of XMRV Env on the 293T cell surface was measured using anti-FLAG and flow cytometry. all truncations were also tagged similarly with an N-terminal FLAG. CT609, which contains the first arginine residue of the CT only, showed a much reduced fusion activity as compared to CT624 and CT613 (5\u201310 syncytia per g DNA, with smaller size) these results were somewhat different from what had been reported for MoMLV, where an identical mutant largely retained the fusogenicity of R peptide-minus mutant [11], [44]. 293T-GFP cells expressing indicated XMRV Env or no envelope (No Env) were co-cultured for 6 h with CMTMR-labeled target 293 cells. fusion percentages (GFP+/CMTMR+) of 3 independent experiments performed in duplicate were averaged (S.D.) CT624 or CT613 induced apparent cell-cell fusion (45%) (p0.05) again, CT609 showed a relatively low cell-cell fusion activity (3%) the tailless CT608 and CT606 mutants were incapable of inducing fusion with background signals. we also examined the fusion activities of all constructs in 293 cells overexpressing the XPR1 receptor. effector 293T/GFP cells expressing indicated XMRV Env were co-cultured with target CMTMR-labeled 293 cells. fusion percentages were plotted against Env surface expression. a representative experiment with standard errors of triplicate samples is shown. truncation of the CT of XMRV Env towards the MSD does not further enhance but impairs the Env fusogenicity. the reason for the decreased fusogenicity remains unclear, but is likely related to reduced surface expression or/and altered Env conformation. XMRV Env truncation mutants can induce cell-cell fusion in non-permissive CHO cells. effector 293T/GFP cells expressing indicated XMRV Env were co-cultured for 6 h with target CMTMR-labeled CHO or CHO cells expressing XPR1 (CHO/XPR1). XPR1 in CHO cells only slightly increased the fusion activities of XMRV Env CT mutants, CT624 and CT613. these results, along with the data using 293/XPR1 cells described above, imply that XPR1 may not be the sole trigger for XMRV Env-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry. the CT of retrovirus Env plays various roles in the replication cycle, including entry and assembly. we have attempted to detect the XMRV TM in viral producer cells and the viral particles using an antibody against the MoMLV TM but without success. the titers of pseudoviral infection for CT624 and CT613 did not correlate with their enhanced Env fusogenicity based on the syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion assays. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol. titers were determined by detecting GFP+ cells 48 h post-infection. results of a typical representative experiment were repeated three times. we did not observe specific block of XMRV entry by Dynasore or a dominant negative mutant of Dynamin (K44A) in 293T cells. previous studies have shown that different endocytic pathways mediate entry of some pH-independent retroviruses, including amphotropic and ecotropic MLV. however the exact mechanisms and the underlying significance remain unknown. soluble form of XMRV SU fusion protein reproducibly binds CHO cells relative to the negative control using secondary antibody alone. overexpression of XPR1 in 293 and CHO cells did not significantly increase the cell-cell fusion activities of XMRV Env truncation mutants despite their increased infection in these cells. however, the lack of infection in the CHO cells for the truncation mutants did not support this hypothesis. XMRV does not infect BHK cells even when XPR1 is overexpressed in this cell line [47], and that XMRV can infect A549 cells even though this cell line does not express a functional XPR1 receptor [55]. this would help to better understand the mechanisms of membrane fusion and cell entry mediated by XMRV Env. new studies will focus on how the CT of XMRV Env structurally modulates the Env fusion activation. CT609 harbours the single arginine residue in the CT possesses a reduced fusogenicity relative to that of CT624 and CT613. this observation is clearly different from what we had seen for JSRV Env [19] and is somewhat different from some though not all of the previous studies on MoMLV [11], [44], [61]. truncation of retroviral Env can alter the ectodomain of the truncated Env receptor binding capability thus affect viral infection [60], [64] prior studies from HIV and other retroviruses have demonstrated that the CT of XMRV Env can alter the Env receptor binding capability. anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) the secondary anti-human antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was purchased from DAKO Cytometer (Glostrup, Denmark) the soluble XMRV SU construct was generated by overlapping PCR using pcDNA3.1-VP62 [37] as templates. the first fragment containing XMRV SU was amplified using the following primers: upstream primer (Not I underlined), 5\u2032- ATCGGCGCTCATTCACGTGATTCCACTTC-3\u2032. the second fragment containing human IgG Fc was generated using the following primers. the XMRV SU fused to the human IgG Fc was generated using the two fragments as templates. the upstream and downstream primer of the first and second fragment was cloned into the pCSI vector. all pseudotypes were harvested 48 and 72 h post-transfection and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,500 g. all viral infections were carried out in the presence of 5 g/ml polybrene (Sigma) and viral titers were determined by AP staining or flow cytometry analysis to measure GFP+ cells 48\u201372 h post-infection. cells were pre-treated with the indicated concentrations of drugs at 37\u00b0C or the soluble proteins at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. target 293, 293/XPR1, CHO, or CHO/XPR1 cells were detached using PBS-5 mM EDTA and labeled with 3.5 M CMTMR in serum-free media for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. effectsor cells and target cells were co-cultured on 24-well plates for the indicated time periods. fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur. cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 and stained using anti-rabbit IgG coupled to FITC. infected cells were selected using G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 days. anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, EZview Red anti-FLAG affinity gel, and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) the red fluorescent dye 5-(and-6)-([4-chloromethylbenzoylamino)tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR) and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) ammonium chloride, chlorpromazine (CPZ), 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) the soluble XMRV SU construct was generated by overlapping PCR using pcDNA3.1-VP62 [37] and the previously described pCSI-JSU (for JSRV fusion protein) as templates. the first fragment containing XMRV SU was amplified using the following primers. the moMLV retroviral pseudotypes encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with pCMV-HIV8.2, pHR'CMVAP [66] and plasmid DNA encoding individual Envs. all pseudotypes were harvested 48 and 72 h post-transfection. 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding XMRV Env or CT truncation mutants plus a GFP-encoding plasmid in order to monitor the transfection efficiency and syncytia formation. effector 293T/GFP cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding XMRV Env or CT truncation mutants using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) effectsor cells and target cells were co-cultured on 24-well plates. fusion was measured by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience, Missauga, Canada) images were taken using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany) images were processed using the ImageJ software (U.S., National Institute of Health)"}
