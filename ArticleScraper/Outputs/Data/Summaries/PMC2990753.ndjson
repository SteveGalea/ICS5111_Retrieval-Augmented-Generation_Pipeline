{"summary": "469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. the most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%) a significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic. perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry. hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information. research on the impact previous disease outbreaks had on the psychological well-being of HCWs has shown that many HCWs presented high levels of psychological distress, frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health, worries about their functional ability and fears of stigmatization. among the factors that have been found to be associated with HCWs' psychological distress in previous infectious disease outbreaks were physical and emotional exhaustion because of an overburdened healthcare system [11], rapidly changing medical information and procedures [5,12], media scrutiny [5, 8.8% of the referred patients were confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases, a proportion which increased rapidly, reaching a peak in the middle of November with 65.8% confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases. from September 2009, to the end of December, 2009, 838 confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases were referred to our hospital, without any reported deaths. H1N1 influenza pandemic, d) perception of personal risk, e.g. stigmatization, isolation and sense of duty, and g. work satisfaction ranged from 0.68 to 0.89. part-I of Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire was embedded in the questionnaire. be infected 161 (60.5) 84 (66.1) 27 (62.8) 22 (66.7) 24 (45.3) 0.015 (a) Isolation from family and/or social environment 34 (12.8) 18 (14.2) 4 (9.3) 4 (12.1) 7 (13.2) 0.294 (a) Perceived risk for being infected by the A/H1N1 virus (1: very low, 9: very high; mean SD; median) 4.5 2.2; 5/9 4.7 5.6 2.9; 6/9 5.9 2.9 4.5 2.7 1,3,4 6.5 2.3 5.9 3.1 0.0005 (b) (a) chi-square test; (b), ANOVA; (c) significant differences between this category and the categories mentioned by numbers. healthcare workers' perceived sufficiency of information about A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and general health information needs (mean SD) 5.4 2.4, 6/9 5.4 2.4 5.3 2.5 5.5 2.2 5.9 2.8 0.408 Overall, the information I have heard about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic has been clear.

Statistical analysis All the statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 15.0. chi-square analyses and one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess differences in concerns, worries, degree of worry and perceived sufficiency of information. a binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the multivariate associations of psychological distress adjusting for demographic variables. the dichotomous dependent variable was \"total GHQ score\" and the cut-off point was \"5\", as found by receiver-operating characteristics analysis for the GHQ-28 in the Greek population [20]. 56.7% of participants reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. the proportion of nurses, auxiliary staff, and allied personnel that reported they were worried was higher compared to that of the medical staff (p 0.0005) the most frequent concern was the risk of infection of family and friends. perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic was considered moderately high to high. medical staff reported the highest rates of perceived sufficiency of information compared to the other groups. factors associated with the degree of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. perceived information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was the variable most closely negatively associated with the degree of worry (p = 0.008) H1N1 influenza infection route 0.017 (4) -0.019 0.781 A/H1N1 influenza preventive measures 0.004 (4) -0.002 0.995 Beliefs about a possible infection It would have major health consequences 0.0005 (4) 0.368 0.0005 It would be difficult to treat 0.0005 (4) 0.154 0.003 Department's efficacy They felt the department had provided clear information about the A/H1N1 influenza 0.510 (4) - 1 (0.59 - 2.07) 0.751 Age 0.559 (4) 1. 0 (0.96 - 1.03) 0.994 Educational Level 0.257 (4) 0. 8 (0.66 - 1.09) 0.201 Living alone 0.268 (3) - - Profession Nurse 0.019 (3) 2. 2 (0.59 - 2.07) 0.046 Medical 0.766 (3) - - Allied 0.037 (3) 1. 7 (0.64 - 4.71) 0.274 Auxiliary 0.0 multivariate logistic regression analysis correctly classified 78.6% of the cases. the cut-off value between \"case\" and \"non-case\" was 0.500. ninety-seven out of the 469 participants presented scores on GHQ-28 > 5, indicative of mild to moderate psychological distress. 56.7% of participants reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. the most frequent concern was the risk of infection of family and friends. concerns about isolation from family and social environment were low. more than half of the HCWs agreed that the ward/department where they worked was well prepared for the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. more than half of the staff agreed that the ward/department where they worked was well prepared for the pandemic. the existence of a service offering psychological support regarding the HWCs' concerns about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered of moderately high importance. few HCWs (N = 31, 6.6%) reported that they had restricted their social contacts because they considered their work environment \"dangerous\" a number of factors associated with the degree of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (N = 469) were associated with the degree of worry.
