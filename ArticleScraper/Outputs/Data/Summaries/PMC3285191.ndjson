{"summary": "the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group (MTBFG) includes viruses associated with important human and animal diseases such as encephalitis. they are positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of about 10.5 kb that encodes all viral proteins in a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by untranslated regions. TBEV is widely distributed throughout continental Europe and Russia. SSEV is endemic to Spain [2]\u2013[6], [8], and LIV, initially considered to be restricted to the British Isles and Ireland [2]\u2013[6], has now been reported from Norway [2] and Denmark [9], [10]. a large dataset that includes sonly E-sequences could be used to date divergence events by specifying informative priors on the ages of some important nodes. we suggest that a large dataset that includes sonly E-sequences could nevertheless be used to date additional divergence events. E_161 was compiled from the 161 longest E-sequences available in Genbank (1033 to 1491 nt in length) endowed with sampling dates (from 1931 to 2008) analysis of the entire species (ALN1) was conducted with split networks using the neighbor-net method. phylogenetic analyses For the phylogenetic analysis, the NS3 partitions 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the putative recombinant fragment were concatenated. trees were inferred separately for the recombinant region alone and for the concatenated region. ML analyses were performed with PAUP* v.4.0b10 [33] in CONSEL [32]. best trees were sought by heuristic searches (10 random addition replicates, TBR branch swapping, Multrees in effect) selection analysis Each gene alignment was investigated for signs of positive selection. we tested the impact of using a GTR model by running an analysis for 20106 generations. estimates for the parameters of interest were largely concordant. the analyses returned very low ESS and much wider confidence intervals. inference 4 refines estimates for tMRCA(W-TBEV) based on 161 E-sequences. prior distribution for meanRate parameter is derived from literature. beAST inference 1: Analysis of variation in substitution rates across the genome. prior distributions for the MeanRate parameter were derived from posteriors in BEAST inference 1 with substitution and clock models unlinked during the analysis. ALN3 (28 full length ORFs with both E-gene and the recombinant fragment omitted) was analyzed the same way as ALN2-2. all alignments, xml-files for the BEAST analyses and all phylogenetic trees have been deposited at Dryad Repository. ALN1 contains 41 complete nucleotide sequences of Tick-borne encephalitis virus and three out-groups selected among LGTV and OHFV. evolutionary distances were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) with a GTR+4+I as the best-fit substitution model. all analyses were carried out with Bonferroni correction (P-value0.05) signals reported by more than one method were retained. the proportion of invariable sites and the number of bootstrap runs were automatically determined. two separate analyses were run simultaneously with MrBayes v.3.2-cvs [29] for 5000000 generations using the default settings for priors and MCMC proposals. selection analysis Each gene alignment (ALN2_C, ALN2_PrM, ALN2_E, ALN2_NS1, ALN2_NS2A, ALN2_NS2B, ALN2_NS3, ALN2_NS4A, ALN2_NS4B and ALN2_NS5) was investigated for signs of positive selection. each analysis was run until the ESS exceeded 200 for all parameters, after which the probability for the whole gene to have evolved under positive selection the uncorrelated lognormally distributed relaxed-clock (UCLN) and the Bayesian Skyline coalescence model [36] were selected as the best fitting clock and demographic models following the procedure in Hon et al. [37]. tMRCA(W-TBEV) and tMRCA(LIV & SSEV) were obtained from BEAST inference 3. beAST inference 1: Analysis of variation in substitution rates across the genome. the same uniform prior was fitted on the root height as before. beAST inference 4: refining estimates for tMRCA(Neudoerfl-Hypr) and tMRCA(LIV & SSEV) were included as priors. the lower bound comes from the value of 7.28105 substitutions/site/year estimated for nonsynonymous substitutions. the upper bound comes from an estimation of 4.78104 substitutions/site/year with a standard error of 1.51104 [39] for synonymous substitutions. a prominent split associated with SSEV (DQ235152) and LIV (Y07863) indicates a marked conflicting and/or ambiguous signal that could be associated with a recombination event. the split-graph focuses on phylogenetic relationships within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus species.

ML and Bayesian reconstructions contrast the placement of LIV in the two partitions: in the non-recombinant partition, LIV groups with SSEV with maximum support and falls outside the highly supported W-TBEV clade. the partitions of NS3 correspond to (a) the recombinant fragment nt 1320\u20131524, (b) nt 1\u20131319 concatenated with nt 1525\u20131866. asterisks (*) mark nodes that are not recovered by Bayesian inference. bars show different amounts of substitution for in-group and out-group taxa. the results of topological constraints and hypotheses testing using the AU test are summarized in Figure 4a. the estimates distinguish the E-gene; it is both the most clearly separated and narrowly distributed. this analysis discloses a large substitution rate variation across the viral genome. dating the recombination event was carried out using the recombinant region ALN2-1 and the recombination free ORF (ALN2-2) divergence times for ALN2-1 were younger and less precise, probably due to the low amount of informative data. a more conservative estimate for the onset of the minor parent would coincide with the divergence of the W-TBEV clade. we analyzed the largest available dataset for TBEV strains with collections dates (161 sequences); unfortunately, it only covers the Envelope glycoprotein (E-gene) enlarged chronogram gives median divergence dates within the W-TBEV, LIV, SSEV, GGEV, TSEV cluster. time point C (218 years, HPD: 150\u2013289) refers to divergence of the two Austrian strains Neudoerfl and Scharl. tMRCAs estimated from ALN2-2 and E_161 are consistent, suggesting that appropriate priors have successfully counterbalanced the influence of a lower substitution rate in the E-gene. the lower bound leaves open the possibility that recombination occurred after the LIV 369/T2 - LI/G divergence. the upper bound sets it within a clade comprising LI/G, LIV 69/T2, LI/261, LI/K, LI/A, LI/NOR and LI/917. a prominent split associated with SSEV (DQ235152) and LIV (Y07863) indicates a marked conflicting and/or ambigu split-graph constructed by neighbor-net method based on 41 complete genomes of TBEV, LIV, LGTV and OHFV. two Russian strains (886\u201384 and 178\u201379) were not assigned to any main subtype at this stage. no significant evidence for recombination was found in the other strains or genes. phylogenetic evidence of recombination was used as a primary detection method. we compared our result to the outcome of the screening. we tested the three putative recombinant fragments obtained by different methods in RDP3. we found that the shorter segment branched together with Neudoerfl with higher support values. a comparison of genetic distances based on nucleotide sequence is reported in Table 2. oerfl Neudoerfl 0.005, 0.005 0.123, 0.139 SSEV 0.118, 0.158 0.113, 0.151 0.101, 0.111 0.131, 0.148 The first number corresponds to uncorrected distances (p-distance), the second to corrected distances (maximum composite likelihood). both alternative placements were rejected by the AU test. the median estimates for the root age and tMRCA(W-TBEV) range between the lowest substitutions rate E-gene and those from the highest rate C-gene. the latter returns the youngest estimates of 939 years for the root and 128 years for W-TBEV divergence. the actual recombination refers to the clustering of the LIV recombinant segment with the Neudoerfl strain. it places tRE at a median of 76 (HPD: 45\u2013160) years before origin. however, caution is advised when interpreting it as the definitive estimate. we used BEAST inference 3 to calculate prior distributions for the root age and tMRCA(W-TBEV) the prior on the substitution rate was derived from literature and not from BEAST inference 1 in order to avoid circularity in the use of data. a paraphyletic group branching at the basis of the far Eastern lineage is addressed by the informal name X-TBEV. it contains Ural siberian, Central Siberian and Transbaikal strains with characteristic E-gene motifs. grey bars at nodes represent 95% HDP credibility intervals. tMRCAs estimated from ALN2-2 and E_161 are consistent, suggesting that the appropriate priors have successfully counterbalanced the influence of a lower substitution rate in the E-gene. the upper (older) bound for the tRE corresponds to the youngest of the parental divergence times in Figure 3. re-analysis of the published data did not recover that signal using a more accurate alignment method and more stringent detection conditions, but found evidences for a different event. the study shows for the first time that demonstrable recombination has occurred in the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. the first posits the presence of non-synonymous mutations that enhance infection or replication in one host, but could have antagonistic effects in the other. the second addresses the differences in replication strategies within the two host types. in the present analysis the Envelope gene displays the lowest substitution rate. it is unclear how this rate shift would impact our estimate of a global rate. it is a form of incremental induction wherein the belief at the end of an investigative step is injected as a prior belief for the next step. this new belief will in turn be modified by conditionalizing upon new evidence. our molecular dating estimates for individual genes approach the limit of 1105 substitutions/site/year below which the temporal signal for heterochronous sampled virus begins to break down. the least reliable time estimates are produced by the shortest alignment, which casts doubt on the tRE lower bound that was derived from 204 nt long sequences. phylogenetic analyses have not shown any clear admixture of Northern and Southern strains that would point towards bird distribution. livestock importation from central Europe to the UK seems a more likely explanation for the footprint of past W-TBEV presence observed in the LIV genome. recombinant sequences in tick-borne flaviviruses can only be detected between sub-types. recombinant sequences in tick-borne flaviviruses are difficult due to high sequence similarity, low substation rate and condensed temporal sampling. recombination occurs in the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group. the low positive selection is a well documented aspect of the mode of evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses [45]\u2013[47], which demonstrate a lack of immune-driven positive selection [46] and a very effective purifying selection [48]. the substitution rate analysis yielded a median of 3.3105 (HPD: 1.5105\u20136.1105) subs./site/year for E, significantly lower than the previously reported rates of 1.6104, within S-TBEV [49] and FE-TB in the present analysis the Envelope gene displays the lowest substitution rate. the reported rate could be explained by the third trade-off mechanism. the other surface-exposed structural proteins do not interact with hosts environment as strongly as the E protein. a weakly informative prior obtained from the literature had the effect of concentrating the probability density around its mean so it could be captured by a narrow shaped gamma distribution. this prior obtained from the literature had the effect of concentrating the probability density around its mean so it could be captured by a narrow shaped gamma distribution. our dating estimates are more accurate than those relying on a poorly fitted molecular clock. more full-length genomes with a wide temporal sampling are required for a definitive assessment of divergence events in the encephalitis virus. recombination occurs when a vector can become infected with multiple strains during co-feeding in close proximity on the host skin. the probability of multiple strains co-infecting the same tick must be low, the short mammalian viraemia and high mortality rate are all plausible factors that would explain that no recombination has hitherto been reported in TBEV. we would therefore recommend to sequence, together with E, a faster evolving marker such as the Capsid-gene. the x axis shows genome length in nucleotides, numbered form the start of ORFs after alignment with Neudoerfl."}
