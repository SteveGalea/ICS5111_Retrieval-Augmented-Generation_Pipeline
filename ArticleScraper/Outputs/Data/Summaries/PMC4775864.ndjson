{"summary": "early coronary artery reperfusion is the most effective procedure for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)1. however, reperfusion associated damage often worsens cardiac integrity, in part by eliciting an extensive inflammatory response. in the heart, MMP activation induces cardiac myocyte necrosis and heart failure, and elicits abnormal ventricular remodeling 4. anti-mMP-2, MMP-9, CD68, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). anti-heavy chain cardiac myosin antibody was from Abcam (Abcam, UK). HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. infarct size Myocardial infarct size was determined by double staining with Evans Blue/TTC dyes. animals were sacrificed, the hearts frozen, sliced in 1mm ring sections perpendicular to the LV long axis, and incubated with 0.5% TTC solution for 5 minutes. iastolic diameter, left-ventricle end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction, and shortening fraction were performed as previously described 7. mouse hearts were embedded in paraffin and 10, 4-m serial sections were obtained from the apex to the mid LAD coronary artery. red fluorescence emitted by NAP9 and NAPSC was detected at 600 nm wave-length in a leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope DSPE-PEG2000-maleimide, and Rhodamine-PE, in a molar ratio 50:39:1:10, dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (4:1 v/v) the solution was hydrated with HEPES buffer, pH 6.7, and 150 mM NaCl. AP9 and the corresponding scrambled peptides were modified by adding a terminal cysteine residue to bind to the male ties were calculated from spin-echo images and different echo times. r1 and r2 values were estimated from slope of longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates vs Gd-DTPA or nanoparticle 8,9,10. FITC-labeled AP-9 peptide and NAP9 micelles were used to examine affinity to endogenous EMMPRIN in cardiac myocytes. animals were anesthetized with mixture of isoflurane and oxygen and placed in prone position inside a 3.5 cm birdcage coil. image acquisition was gated to the ECG and respiration signals using an external monitoring and gating system. two and four chambers images were acquired along the entire heart of the mouse. eight MR images of the matched (pre- and post-contrast) slices for each mouse were used for analysis. if otherwise specified, data are expressed as means SD. animal experiments were performed in triplicate. animal model of Ischemia/Reperfusion Ischemia was induced by coronary artery ligation. twelve-week-old mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. the thorax was opened between the second and the third ribs and widened with the aid of a mouse retractor. mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane gas, resulting in a heart rate of approximately 400 beats/min. anesthetized animals were placed on the Integrated Rail System and Mouse Handling Table (provided by the manufacturer), which allows simultaneous acquisition of temperature data (37\u00b0C, by using the integrated heating pad) and electrocardiography (lead II) throughout the experiment. the effects of NAP9 and NAPSC on cell viability were determined by flow cytometry (FACS scanner, Becton Dickinson) the peptides were modified by adding a terminal cysteine residue to bind to the maleimide moiety at a molar ratio 1:40 (micelle:peptide) the number of peptide molecules bound per micelle was calculated by HLPC. affinity measurements AP-9 peptide was labeled with Fluorescein isothiocyanate. 105 adherent HL1 cells were plated into microwell plates and incubated for 5 hours at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were resuspended, then pelleted down, and fluorescence was measured in the supernatant (free peptide or micelle), and in the pellet (peptide or micelle bound to endogenous EMMPRIN) fractions. the measurements after the contrast agent injection were repeated every 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. the parameters for these experiments were: TR = 200 ms; TE = 2.3 ms; flip angle = 80o; NEX = 8. control micelles were generated by adding a cysteine residue to an AP-9 scrambled peptide. affinity of AP-9 peptide and NAP9 micelles to endogenous EMMPRIN was calculated. nanoprobe cytotoxicity was tested in HL1 myocyte cell cultures 48 hours after incubation with increasing amounts of NAP9. cells were incubated 1 hour with 10nM NAP9 or NAPSC. endogenous EMMPRIN was detected in green (anti-EMMPRIN primary antibodies and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies) co-localization was detected by merging both fluorescing signals (Merged panels, yellow) plasma levels of hepatic alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine (Crea) and creatinine kinase (CK-MB) were measured. after 10 days, plasma levels of hepatic alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine (Crea) and creatinine kinase (CK-MB a dosage of 50mg/kg NAP9 was selected as the amount of NAP9 visualized by confocal microscopy with lower toxicity. expression of endogenous EMMPRIN was stimulated in cardiac cells as a result of IR. the uptake of NAP9 was maximal in the heart sections of mice subjected to IR. LVEF values from non ischemic (healthy) mice and from mice subjected to IR for 24 hours and were injected with 50 mg/Kg NAP9, NAPSC, or saline (Control) right after ischemia (n=9 mice/group; mean SD; *p 0.05, NAP9 vs Control) IR induces the expression of EMMPRIN in mouse hearts7, leading to the expression and activity of different MMPs. we analyzed the levels of MMP-2, and MMP-9, indicative of EMMPRIN activation in the heart. non invasive magnetic resonance imaging of NAP9 correlates with ex vivo LV infarction size. in healthy animals, neither NAP9 nor NAPSC caused enhancement of the hearts at 24 hours post injection. mice were injected with 50mg/kg NAP9, or NAPSC, 1 day before IR (t-1d, group A), at the time of ischemia (t0d, group B), and 1 day after IR (t+1d, group C) the cardioprotective effect of NAP9 is maximal within the first 24 hours after injection. administration of NAP9 before ischemia (t-1) had a non significant effect on LVEF. LVEF of healthy hearts or hearts from mice subjected to IR and injected one day before (Group A: T-1d) at the same time (Group B: T0d) or one day after (Group C: T+1d) measured 24 hours after injection. NAP9 uptake was detected by confocal microscopy in the hearts of healthy mice. a dosage of 50mg/kg NAP9 was selected as the amount of NAP9 visualized by confocal microscopy. the expression of endogenous EMMPRIN was stimulated in cardiac cells as a result of IR. the uptake of NAP9 was maximal in the heart sections of mice subjected to IR, when compared to the hearts of healthy mice. the uptake of NAP9 was maximal in the heart sections of mice subjected to IR. n=9 mice/group; mean SD; *p 0.05, NAP9 vs Control. GAPDH was used as loading control (n=9 mice/group; mean SD; *p 0.05, NAP9 vs Control and NAPSC) 469.32 SV (ml) 41.1373.2 26.4021.25 40.1795.61 30.835.22 EF (%) 61.9464.38 33.2715.92 * 55.4994.25 38.044.32 FS (%) 34.4972.95 21.052.45 29.9864.74 26.0341.89. non invasive magnetic resonance imaging of NAP9 correlates with ex vivo LV infarction size. we performed CMR scans in healthy mice or in mice subjected to IR. in healthy animals, neither NAP9 nor NAPSC caused enhancement of the heart. n=9 mice/condition; mean SD; *p 0.05, NAP9 vs Control and NAPSC in AMI. same mice were used to evaluate ex vivo cardiac damage by Evans Blue/TTC staining. LVEF of healthy hearts or hearts from mice subjected to IR and injected one day before (Group A: T-1d) at the same time (Group B: T+1d) at the same time (Group B: T0d) or one day after (Group C: T+1d) with 50 mg/Kg NAP9, NAPSC, or saline (Control) and measured 24 hours after injection. extracellular matrix degradation is a key step that precedes cardiac remodeling as a result of coronary artery occlusion, and subsequent ischemia and reperfusion12. targeting extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) with paramagnetic fluorescent micellar nanoparticles reduced reperfusion damage in hearts subjected to AMI. in the heart, infiltrated monocytes and cardiac myocytes produce large amounts of EMMPRIN in response to ischemia, promoting MMP-mediated extracellular matrix degradation and cardiac cell death 24-26. we found that antibody-mediated EMMPRIN inhibition reduced infarct size in murine models of IR 7. a future translation to the bed side will require additional nanoparticle formulation to avoid potential nanoparticle-derived side effects. a close correlation between the CMR signal enhancement and myocardial infarction was calculated in NAP9 injected mice subjected to IR."}
