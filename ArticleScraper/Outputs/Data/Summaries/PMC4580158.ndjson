{"summary": "attenuation involves genetic disablement of functions connected to replication of a virus or viral vector. reduced replication capability would be expected to be directly reflected in lower oncolytic activity. a number of studies compared immune responses to matching pairs of attenuated viruses that maintained some of their replication ability. a gene switch activated by a small-molecule regulator (SMR) is not indicated because it would not be possible to confine the regulator to the inoculation region. targetable physical stimuli include visible light, infrared (IR), UV, ultrasound, microwave, and electromagnetic radiation, and heat/cold. one or more replication-essential genes may be placed under the control of both an HSP70B promoter and an SMR-activated gene switch. one or more replication-essential genes may be placed under the control of both an HSP70B promoter and an SMR-activated gene switch. gene switch is not appreciably activated by either heat treatment or the SMR alone. versions of the gene switch employing different SMR-activated transactivators are available (21\u201323) the virus is widespread in the human population, with a seroprevalence that increases in an age-dependent manner. the remaining 10% largely experience periodic clinical lesions referred to as \"cold sores\" the virus responds to drugs such as acyclovir. gestrol acetate, norgestimate, and PF-02367982 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) all other progestins and antiprogestins were initially dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) cells were propagated in minimal essential medium Eagle (MEME) supplemented with 5% calf serum, 292 mg/ml l-glutamine, 250 U of penicillin/ml. the PCR product was digested with SacI and inserted into the SacI restriction site of pBluescript to create pIN994. an HSV-1 downstream recombination arm was generated using primers DB115-KpnI and DB120-KpnI to amplify HSV-1 (17syn+) DNA sequence between bp 95,441 and 96,090.

Ligation placed the first insert into the vector's polylinker. pBS-KS:ICP8promoter was digested with AatII and HindIII. the resulting 4,588-bp fragment was gel purified and SAP treated. a colony was expanded, test digested, and verified by sequencing. recombination plasmid pBS-KS:ICP8promoter was constructed using the same strategy as that described above for the creation of pBS-KS:ICP4promoter. a first insert was PCR amplified from HSV-1 17syn+ virion DNA using primers HSV1.61841-61865 and HSV1.62053-62027. a second insert was subcloned into pBS-KS:ICP8-3\u2032 confluent monolayers of target cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C; then the inoculum was removed. the cells were overlaid with complete medium. the antiserum was aspirated, the monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS. the plaques were visualized by adding 200 l of Immunopure diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. each treatment group consisted of three replicate dishes (for each time point) mice were anesthetized and inoculated with 1 105 PFU of HSV-GS3 vector. each treatment group consisted of five mice. heat treatment was performed at 45\u00b0C for 10 min. Rabbit skin (RS) cells were a gift from E. Wagner. they were propagated in minimal essential medium Eagle. all cells were cultured under 5% CO2. an HSV-1 downstream recombination arm was generated using primers DB115-KpnI and DB120-KpnI to amplify HSV-1 (17syn+) DNA sequence between bp 96,092 and 96,538. the product was digested with SacI and inserted into the SacI restriction site of pBluescript to create pUP.

Virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C; then the inoculum was removed, and the cells were overlaid with complete medium. heat treatment was performed either immediately after infection or 4 h later by floating the sealed dishes in a 43.5\u00b0C water bath. antiprogestin (i.e., mifepristone or ulipristal) treatment was initiated at the time of the initial infection. heat treatment was performed by floating the sealed dishes in a 43.5\u00b0C water bath for 30 min. extracted DNA was subject to TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for quantitative analysis of HSV-1 DNA. 105 PFU of HSV-GS3 vector followed saline pretreatment and light abrasion of both rear footpads essentially as previously described (27). each treatment group consisted of five mice. the animal studies were approved by the university of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. activator GLP65 is a chimeric factor containing a truncated ligand-binding domain from a human progesterone receptor (PR), and transcriptional activation domains from human NF-B P65. the PR sequence in GLP65 lacks all PR AFs, the unique PR sumoylation site, and all known PR sites whose phosphorylation can enhance PR activity (7, 44) the activity of telapristone was similar to that of mifepristone. ulipristal (CDB-2914) was more active. no activity was recorded for the synthetic antiprogestin PF-62367982. rethindrone 0.1 0 0.1 0 Norethindrone acetate 0.1 0 0.1 0.1 Norgestimate 0.1 0 0.1 0 a In the controls (no compound) no activity was detected without heat treatment, and an activity of 0.1 0 was detected with heat treatment. Boldface indicates the reference value. ND, none detected. replication of HSV-GS1 in the permissive E5 cells (that express ICP4) was compared with that in the nonpermissive RS cells. this result suggested that replication of HSV-GS1 was stringently controlled by the dually responsive gene switch. single-step growth experiments were carried out in vero cells using the procedure described in Materials and Methods. it is noted that these experiments were performed at an MOI of 3. single-step growth experiments were carried out to characterize HSV-GS3. a single mutation or recombination event may be sufficient to remove the ICP4 genes from regulation. HSV-GS3 replicated nearly as efficiently as wild-type virus. the activating treatment had only a minor effect on the replication efficiencies of HSV-GS3 and wild-type virus. additional single-step growth experiments were carried out. heat treatments at 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min were performed immediately after infection. cultures were harvested at different times after infection. DNA and RNA were extracted and analyzed by qPCR and RT-qPCR. adult female mice were inoculated with HSV-GS3 on both rear footpads. different doses of ulipristal were administered intraperitoneally at the time of infection. heat treatment was performed at 45\u00b0C for 10 min (by immersion of hind feet in a water bath) heat treatment at 45\u00b0C for 10 min was performed 3 h after virus administration. Mice were sacrificed 24 h (panels A to C) or 4 days (panel D) after heat treatment. DNA and RNA were isolated from feet and dorsal root ganglia. the best-characterized dually responsive gene switch employs transactivator GLP65. it contains the highly heat-inducible HSP70B promoter and a transactivator activated by a small-molecule regulator (SMR) it appears that the choice of transactivator is not particularly limited by functional constraints. the main concern with the use of GLP65 would be the possibility of inadvertent activation by one of the many progestins that are in extensive use in long-term control medications. to address this concern, we attempted to compile a complete list of medically used progestins, procured the compounds identified, and tested their ability to coactivate a heat- and antiprogestin-activated gene switch. thynodiol diacetate ND ND Etonogestrel ND 0.1 0.2 ND Norethindrone acetate ND 0.1 0.1 Norgestimate ND ND With heat (43\u00b0C, 2 h) Mifepristone 59 16 100 14b d-Norgestrel ND 0.1 0.1 Ethynodiol diacetate 0.1 0 0.1 0 Etonoges apristone ND 0.1 0 \u2014 Ulipristal 0.3 0.1 0.4 0 \u2014 PF-02367982 ND 0.2 0 0.3 0 a Control values (no compound) were 0.2 0 without heat and 0.4 0.1 with heat treatment.

DNA replication and viral gene transcription did not occur in the absence of heat treatment. heat treatment (43.5\u00b0C for 30 min) was administered 4 h after infection. heat treatment alone (Fig. 5A, the condition heat plus 1 g/kg ulipristal) or administration of ulipristal alone did not result in increased DNA levels. results were mirrored at the level of ICP4 and gC transcripts, at least in feet. ganglia and feet were dissected and homogenized. ganglia and feet were either untreated or subjected to activating treatment. low levels of HSV-1 DNA were found in DRG of KD6- and GS3-infected animals. replication-competent controlled viruses can induce one or more initial rounds of robust viral replication in the target tissue. this is in contrast to replication-defective or attenuated HSV vectors that, because of their nature, are not expected to be similarly effective immunogens. if heat and antiprogestin are reapplied, replication is limited to the initially infected cell. replication-essential viral genes are subjected to the control of a dually responsive gene switch. essentially any two or more replication-essential viral genes may be so controlled. there is no reason why components of immune evasion mechanisms could not be disabled. strict dual regulation of replication of a controlled herpesvirus will be particularly important at the time of administration. sporadic, single uses of antiprogestins would likely pose minimal risks. other SMR-dependent transactivators may be used in replication-competent controlled viruses such as the well-characterized Tet-on transactivators. gene for a heterologous antigen may be subjected to the control of the dually responsive gene switch or to an unregulated promoter. a phase 3 study on melanoma patients revealed a statistically significant better response to intralesional injection of T-VEC than to control treatment. the controlled virus could be directly administered to lesions and specifically activated within the lesions. heat shock protein (HSP) promoter in a narrowly defined tissue region of a small animal. activating heat treatment may provide an additional independent benefit."}
