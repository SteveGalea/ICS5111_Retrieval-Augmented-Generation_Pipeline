{"summary": "vaccines are the most efficient way to control epidemics caused by infectious pathogens. this is best exemplified by Edward Jenner\u2019s discovery in 1796. the infection of humans with a cowpox virus generates a crossprotective immune response against infection with human virus. active immunization involves the transfer of foreign antibodies against pathogens into the body for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes. the corresponding antigens are processed by antigen-presenting cells (APC) to expose pathogen-specific peptides on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) types I and II. this natural immune response also includes the generation of long-lived memory B and T cells. ogen and subunit Vaccines to Epitope Vaccines Different types of vaccines have been generated during the long history of vaccine development. in immunocompromised patients attenuated microorganisms may revert to their initial replication potential and eventually cause disease. the rabies vaccine is based on an inactivated form of the virus. combinations of vaccine immunogens have to be used to cover the diversity of viral strains arising by antigenic drift. this requires a continous monitoring of the circulating influenza virus strains. this requires a continous monitoring of the circulating influenza virus strains. this requires a continous monitoring of the circulating influenza virus strains. recombinantly expressed receptor-binding domains of spike protein could protect from SARS-CoV challenge in animal models. even smaller spike components are epitope vaccines that should mimic conserved and functionally important domains in the otherwise highly variable surface proteins of the virus. epitope-based malaria vaccine (RTS, S = MosquirixTM) is based on the expression of contiguous immunogenic epitopes from the predominant surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum involved in the attachment to circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on liver cells. the epitopes were presented on the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) virus-like particle platform. 36.7 million people are living with HIV-1 worldwide. 90% should be on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to result in 90% virally suppressed individuals in 2020. 1.8 million new infections were still registered in 2016 and 1 million HIV-related deaths. HIV-1 infection often does not cause specific signs of HIV-related disease in the first years after infection. effective vaccination would prevent transmission of HIV-1 from donors to recipients irrespective of their serological status. effective vaccine could substitute the administration of antiviral drugs for prevention of infection in healthy people at risk. virus variability leads to immunological escape (3). non-functional Env epitopes are exposed through shedding of gp120 (6). viral variability is the major problem for vaccine development. the native Env spike is a trimer of three heterodimers, each composed of the outer envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. more than half of the mass of these glycoproteins is composed of sugars, which cover the outer surface of the spike. this low number is enough for infection, but minimizes the particle\u2019s immunogenicity. initial vaccine trials were based on soluble monomeric gp120 often derived from culture-adapted HIV-1 strains. soluble mimetics of the native trimeric Env spike were rationally designed based on structural and functional analyses. major advances in the field were obtained when soluble mimetics of the native trimeric Env spike were rationally designed based on structural and functional analyses. a plethora of bnAbs have been characterized in recent years. their detailed characterization revealed peculiar features like a high degree of affinity maturation, long heavy chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR) 3 loops, and sometimes autoreactivity. bnAbs in clinical trials were shown to reduce viremia and to delay viral rebound upon therapeutic applications. structural knowledge of epitopes for bnAbs stimulated studies focusing on synthesis or expression of such epitopes as recombinant peptides. this approach of structure-based reverse vaccinology or epitope-focused vaccine design is conceptually very elegant. it has recently been proven to work in terms of inducing epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies against the respiratory syncytial virus. synthetic peptide strategies have been developed to mimic functionally important sites of the viral Env spike to be used as immunogens in active vaccination approaches. synthetic mimics of the CD4bs were initially thought to be adequate immunogens to elicit a broadly neutralizing immune response similar to that of natural bnAbs which recognize the CD4bs. antisera competed with mAb b12, whose epitope overlaps the CD4bs of gp120 [93] for binding to gp120; however, the antisera were not found to be virus-neutralizing. we had anticipated that CD4bs-M would be able to inhibit the gp120\u2013CD4 interaction also in the context of HIV-1 infection. b12 mimotope peptide was unable to elicit a gp120-cross reactive immune response when used as immunogen in mice. resulting polyclonal antisera were shown to neutralize tier 1 HIV-1 isolates in vitro. we have recently reported on paratope mimetic peptides of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody b12 [101]. this antibody recognizes the CD4bs of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120, and efficiently neutralizes HIV-1 infections in vitro and in vivo. b12 mimetic peptide was shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection. a special software was developed to analyze whether the selected linear mimotope sequences could represent conformational epitopes on the Env surface. some of the selected mimotopes could induce weak HIV-neutralizing antibodies in mice after vaccination with the mimotopes in the phage context. the EC26-2A4 epitope was responsible for most of the neutralizing activity of plasma EC26. plasma antibodies affinity-purified with the epitope had neutralizing activity. immunization with the epitope coupled to different carriers induced neutralizing antibodies in mice [107,109] the gp41 epitope, 3S, is most advanced with respect to clinical development. it interacts with gC1qR, a receptor for the globular form of the C1q complement factor. it induces the expression of a cellular ligand of the activating NKp44 natural killer receptor rendering uninfected CD4-positive cells sensitive to NK cell lysis in HIV-1 positive patients. 3S peptide interacts with gC1qR complement receptor (orange) on uninfected CD4+ cells. this leads to upregulation of the NKp44 ligand (gray) on the surface (3). this leads to upregulation of the NKp44 ligand (gray) on the surface (3). this leads to upregulation of the NKp44 ligand (green) expressed on NK cells. 14A-3S bnAbs were strongly increased in untreated long-term non-progressor (LTNP) patients from the ALT cohort compared to HIV progressor patients (25% vs. 4%), suggesting that these specific bnAbs are likely associated with a lack of disease progression. their neutralizing capacity was inversely correlated with viral load and proviral DNA and associated with preservation of CD4 count. low immunogenicity and high stability vectors derived from the adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have become particularly popular for this purpose. a further advantage of using vectors for over-expression of bnAbs is the combined application of multiple bnAbs. the latter impressively decreases the risk of selecting immune-escaping variants. the concept of providing bnAbs to support the patient\u2019s immune system is fascinating. however, such antibodies are \u201cforeign\u201d for the host immune system. a novel generation of vectors may revive the concepts of inducing bnAbs by active immunization. vector capsids (red) serve as scaffolds for antigen display (green dots) thereby, a patient\u2019s immune system is primed upon vector delivery through antigens already displayed on the capsid. the vector-encoded protein antigen is then secreted, providing the source for the antigenic boost (green Env trimers) a worldwide effort was initiated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and partners in 2014 to achieve the 90\u201390\u201390 agenda. 90% should be on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to result in 90% virally suppressed individuals in 2020. 1.8 million new infections were still registered in 2016 as well as 1 million HIV-related deaths. HIV-1 integrates its proviral DNA generated during reverse transcription of its RNA genome shortly after infection into the human chromosomes of infected cells. it can persist incognito with low-level replication in the absence of ART. effective vaccination would prevent transmission from donors to recipients irrespective of their serological status. effective vaccine could substitute the administration of antiviral drugs for prevention of infection in healthy people at risk. HIV-1 infection eliminates a central cell type and organ of the immune system. this process takes time, as after integration HIV-1 can persist silently or at low replication levels. Virus variability leads to immunological escape (3). the native Env spike is a trimer of three heterodimers, each composed of the outer envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. more than half of the mass of these glycoproteins is composed of sugars, which cover the outer surface of the spike. this low number is enough for infection, but minimizes the immunogenicity of virus particles. the evasion tricks of HIV-1 fool our immune system, but also did so with researchers involved in HIV vaccine research for decades. initial trials were based on soluble monomeric gp120 often derived from culture-adapted HIV-1 strains which are not suited to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. at best, these vaccines could induce antibodies neutralizing autologous HIV-1 strains. a plethora of bnAbs have been characterized in recent years. their detailed characterization revealed peculiar features like a high degree of affinity maturation, long heavy chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR) 3 loops, and sometimes autoreactivity. bnAbs in clinical trials were shown to reduce viremia and to delay viral rebound upon therapeutic applications. bnAb antigens identified essential regions in the viral spike targeted by bnAbs. these include the CD4 binding site, the apex of the variable loop 2 (V2) and the gp120/g41 interface. additional sites comprise the MPER and the fusion peptide in gp41. synthetic peptide strategies have been developed to mimic functionally important sites of the viral Env spike to be used as immunogens in active vaccination approaches. a range of bnAbs isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals were shown to recognize epitopes that overlap the CD4bs. antisera obtained through the immunization of rabbits with this peptide specifically recognized gp120. antisera competed with mAb b12, whose epitope overlaps the CD4bs of gp120 [93] for binding to gp120. however, the antisera were not found to be virus-neutralizing. b12 mimotope peptide was unable to elicit a gp120-cross reactive immune response when used as immunogen in mice. resulting polyclonal antisera were shown to neutralize tier 1 HIV-1 isolates in vitro. antibody paratopes mimic the binding specificities of an antibody. this antibody recognizes the CD4bs of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. this antibody effectively neutralizes HIV-1 infections in vitro and in vivo. bnAbs from patient sera were also identified by the phage display technology. a special software was developed to analyze whether the selected linear mimotope sequences, without obvious linear homology to Env, could represent conformational epitopes on the Env surface. this epitope of 29 amino acids overlaps but clearly differs from the epitope of the first generation mAb 2F5 [110]. EC26-2A4 epitope was, indeed, responsible for most of the neutralizing activity of plasma EC26, as (i) preabsorption of plasma with the epitope coupled to an affinity column reduced its neutralizing activity; (ii) plasma antibodies affinity-purified with the epitope had neutralizing activity. patients with EC26-2A4M-specific antibodies at early and late stages after infection had a higher CD4 nadir. the other gp41 epitope, 3S, is most advanced with respect to clinical development. the highly conserved 3S motif interacts with gC1qR, a receptor for the globular form of the C1q complement factor. it induces the expression of a cellular ligand of the activating NKp44 natural killer receptor 3S-peptide interacts with gC1qR complement receptor (orange) on uninfected CD4+ cells. this leads to upregulation of the NKp44 ligand (gray) on the surface (3). this leads to upregulation of the NKp44 ligand (gray) on the surface (3). the unique properties of the 3S peptide were further studied. anti-W614A-3S bnAbs from serum were able to neutralize high titers of tier 2 viruses from clades B, C and E [124]. the presence of anti-W614A-3S bnAbs was strongly increased in untreated long-term non-progressor (LTNP) patients from the french ALT cohort (ANRS CO15), suggesting that these specific bnAbs are likely associated with a lack of disease progression. synthetic mimics of the CD4bs were initially thought to be adequate immunogens to elicit a broadly neutralizing immune response similar to that of natural bnAbs. synthetic peptides\u2014as compared to recombinantly generated peptides and proteins\u2014are useful tools for the mimicry of protein sites, including epitopes for antibodies. such modifications also increase the proteolytic stability of the molecules, enhancing their potential as drug candidates. we had anticipated that CD4bs-M would inhibit the gp120\u2013CD4 interaction also in the context of HIV-1 infection. aggregation and fibril formation strongly contribute to the effects observed for CD4bs-M. this is based on our observation that CD4bs-M specifically interacts with gp120 proteins from different HIV-1 strains. b12 mimotope peptide was unable to elicit a gp120-cross reactive immune response when used as immunogen in mice [96]. the resulting polyclonal antisera were shown to neutralize tier 1 HIV-1 isolates in vitro. paratope mimetic peptides of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody b12. antibody recognizes the CD4bs of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. b12 mimetic peptide was shown to bind gp120 at sub-micromolar concentrations, as well as to inhibit HIV-1 infection. two interesting linear epitope sequences were identified in the gp41 transmembrane protein. EC26-2A4M and W614A-3S also contain additional epitopes for neutralizing Abs like the first-generation mAbs 2F5 and 4E10. the EC26-2A4 epitope was further optimized to determine the core epitope amino acids targeted by neutralizing antibodies from EC26. this is important in view of vaccination studies, as autoreactivity may lead to the elimination of antibody-producing cells during B cell ontology or in the periphery. the mechanism of action is composed of successive steps. the expression of NKp44 ligand is strongly correlated with disease progression. the 3S motif is characterized by its high level of conservation through HIV-1 strains of the different clades. the unique properties of the 3S peptide were further studied by an Alanine-walk through the 3S motif. a specific substitution at position 614, called W614A-3S, was able to elicit bnAbs with cross-clade viral neutralization properties in mice immunized with the W614A-3S peptide. CD4+ T cells from LTNP patients producing W614A-3S specific bnAbs could specifically recognize antigens from both HIV itself and recall antigens. this study provides strong arguments that W614A-3S bnAbs contribute to the LTNP status. in vivo immunization or passive-transfer experiments with purified W614A-3S Abs alone or in combination with other epitopes. a plethora of natural occurring serotypes is available allowing a (nearly) free choice of target tissue and prime-boost vaccination schemes. muscle has emerged as the main target tissue for the current approaches, resulting in continous release of bnAbs. the magnitude of the immune response strongly correlated with the maturation status of the antibody sequence, arguing that highly evolved antibodies are more easily recognized as foreign. a novel generation of vectors may revive the concepts of inducing bnAbs by active immunization. in vivo studies have to show if this approach is feasible for HIV-1 Env antigens or if Env-intrinsic properties like immunosuppressive domains present in gp41 may limit the immunogenicity. the last few years have yielded crucial insights into the HIV-specific difficulties in vaccine development. the future has to show if such immunogens are sufficient to generate bnAbs able to protect from infection by all clades. vaccines with less than 100% protection will also reduce the number of new infections."}
