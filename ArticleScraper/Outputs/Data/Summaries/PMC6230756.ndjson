{"summary": "the major cause of myocarditis in the paediatric population is viral infection, including coxsackievirus B3, adenovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, influenza A and B, and hepatitis. we report the detection of rhinovirus C in a boy with a clinical presentation of myocarditis, suggesting a possible causative role of this virus. the most common viral causes of myocarditis in the paediatric population include coxsackievirus B3, adenovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, influenza A and B, and hepatitis viruses. the gold standard for confirming viral aetiology is virus detection from heart muscle biopsy sample. the association of rhinovirus C with DCM or myocarditis is not well documented. there are about 55 different types of human rhinovirus C, with 13 % variability in VP1 and at least 10 % variability in VP4/VP2. there was no history of chest pain, cyanosis, joint pain or swelling. laboratory examinations revealed a normal haemoglobin level of 132 g l1. the platelet count was within normal limits (342 000 platelets mm3) cardiac markers such as troponin, creatinine kinase and its MB isoenzyme were not tested due to limited resources. cDNA was obtained from 140 l nasal swab in viral transport medium and serum from the patient using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) the cDNA was then used as a template for detection by Enterovirus genus-level PCR targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), following a published report. the sequence has been submitted to GenBank with accession number KY379152. the sequence has similarity of only 97 % with the closest strain isolated in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) and Japan in 2012. analysis on the VP4/VP2 region of the virus showed only 96\u201397 % similarity with the strain detected in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) and Japan in 2012. however, the circulation of this virus in Indonesia has not been reported. the association between rhinovirus C and DCM or myocarditis has never been reported previously. edward et al."}
