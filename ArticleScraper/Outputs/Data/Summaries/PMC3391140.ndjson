{"summary": "both DNA and protein microarrays have since become established as powerful methods for genome and proteome investigations. more recently, glycan microarray technology has also been developed for the high-throughput analysis of glycan-binding proteins (5\u20139). comparisons of arrays focused on one major class of glycans are likely to generate interpretable information. the three most common Sias in mammals are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its hydroxylated form N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) lycoconjugates (22\u201332) allowed collection of a large library of such glycans that was used to generate two extensive glycan microarrays (11, 15), which are valuable tools for identification and characterization of sialic acid-binding proteins and various lectins. together, they encompass one of the largest sialoglycan collections available to date and exemplify the diversity in Sia modifications, linkages, and underlying glycans slides were centrifuged at 200 g for 3 min and then washed twice with 50 \u00b0C prewarmed distilled H2O. the blocking solution was aspirated, and diluted primary samples were added to each slide. the biotinylated lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis I and II (MAL-1 and MAL-2) were from Vector Laboratories. monoclonal chicken anti-Neu5Gc IgYs (mChGc6-1 and mChGc2-7) were used as diluted hybridoma supernatants. borohydride in PBS, pH 6.5 (final concentration of 20 mm) followed by 10-min incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. arrays were then washed three times (10 min each wash) with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and three times with PBS, pH 7.4. analysis was conducted to compare reproducibility between slides. Array 2 was printed as described (11). Array Binding Assays Slides were incubated for 1 h in a staining dish with 50 \u00b0C prewarmed blocking solution. slides were then fitted with a ProPlateTM multiarray slide module (Invitrogen) to divide into subarrays and then blocked with 200 l/subarray of Buffer 1 (PBS/OVA; 1% (w/v) ovalbumin in PBS, pH 7. Buffer 2 (BisTris, pH 6, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NaCl) was supplemented with 0.1% ovalbumin. biotinylated lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis I and II (MAL-1 and MAL-2) were from Vector Laboratories. monoclonal chicken anti-Neu5G gentle shaking for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C in the dark with 200 l/subarray of freshly prepared cold 2 mm sodium metaperiodate in PBS, pH 6.5. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 l of 100 mm sodium borohydride in PBS, pH 6.5 (final concentration of 20 mm), followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. Array 2 was printed as described (15) with each glycoconjugate at 100 m. slides were incubated for 1 h in a staining dish with 50 \u00b0C prewarmed blocking solution. washed twice with 50 \u00b0C prewarmed distilled H2O. slides were then fitted with a ProPlateTM multiarray slide module. dry slides were vacuum-sealed and stored in the dark until scanning the following day. affinity-purified polyclonal chicken anti-Neu5Gc IgY (pChGc) was prepared. periodate treatment to Detect Sia-specific Binding Slides were rehydrated for 10 min. slides were incubated with gentle shaking for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. borohydride inactivates the periodate. sialoglycan microarray Fabrication Array 1 was printed on epoxide-derivatized slides (Corning by Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described (15) with each glycoconjugate at 100 m in an optimized print buffer. slides were then fitted with a ProPlateTM multiarray slide module (Invitrogen) to divide into subarrays. slides were washed three times with PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween) and then with PBS for 10 min/wash. slides were vacuum-sealed and stored in the dark until scanning the following day. antibodies and lectins antibodies/lectins were diluted as described. gG (H+L), and Cy3-AffiniPure donkey-anti-chicken IgY (H+L) were from invitrogen. periodate treatment to Detect Sia-specific Binding Slides were rehydrated for 10 min at room temperature. slides were either periodate-treated or mock-treated. image analysis was carried out with Genepix Pro 6.0 analysis software. slides were scanned using a ProScan Array (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and data was processed using the manufacturer's software as described (11). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Similarities and Differences between two sialylglycan microarrays. glycan arrays were designed and constructed in separate laboratories with different emphases. the sialic acid derivatives and sialylation methodologies were from one single laboratory (22\u201332), ensuring comparability in this key aspect of the arrays. glycans of Array 1 were individually synthesized, purified, and printed by contact printing on epoxide-activated glass slides (15). a comparison of the 48 glycans that share common terminal glycan structures between the two arrays with the four sialic acids making up Array 1. the differences are ranked, based on the differences in their underlying glycan skeletons. the data generated were then compared between the different arrays. each glycan probe was printed in four replicates, and the signals were averaged. the binding was ranked as percentage of maximum signal in each array assay. the average rank of each GBP was then ordered according to relevant common features. a sialylated trisaccharide (Sia2\u20136LacNAc) is further stabilized by the sialylated trisaccharide (Sia2\u20136LacNAc) an N-acetyl group at the reducing end second sugar reduced the binding (Sia2\u20136Gal > Sia2\u20136GalNAc) d, ranked binding of all plant lectins on both arrays. binding of biotinylated lectins was ranked as the percentage of maximum signal in each array. binding was ranked as the percentage of maximum signal in each array. modifications of the terminal Sia affect SNA binding to Array 2 sialoglycans. acetyl groups at both the C-5 amino group and the C-9 hydroxyl group of sialic acid stabilize the binding. methyl modification at position 8 abolished binding. pattern on Array 2 is similar to previous analysis conducted in different buffer conditions. despite differences in relative fluorescence units (RFU) values at comparable concentrations, the data from Array 1 and Array 2 complement each other. Array 2 showed stronger binding with MAL-1 specifically for Sia2\u20133-glycan and underlying glycan preference toward LNnT or NA2. the lower level of binding to Array 1 compared with Array 2 may result from various factors. glycans 30, 23, 17, 29, and 26 ranked 95, 80, 72, 70, and 62. binding pattern is similar to previous analysis conducted with different buffer conditions. MAL-2 showed stronger binding to Array 1 than to Array 2. Array 2 provides a logical explanation for the lack of MAL-2 binding on Array 1. some lectins require divalent cations for optimal binding. we assayed MAL-2 on Array 1 with Buffer 2 (BisTris, pH 6.0, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NaCl), which was supplemented with 1% ovalbumin for blocking. polyclonal antibody pChGc recognition was not greatly affected by the various underlying skeletons or the terminal sialyl linkages. binding was affected by the various underlying skeletons, the terminal sialyl linkages, and most significantly, the Sia type. selective recognition of sialoglycans by specific antibodies. chicken monoclonal anti-Neu5Gc antibodies were assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1. monoclonal anti-Neu5Gc IgY at 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 dilutions. average rank is presented as a heat map of all tested glycans. only the Neu5Gc-glycoconjugates are presented. mChGc2\u20137 resembled pChGc and showed a broader binding profile on both arrays compared with mChGc6-1. on both arrays, mChGc2-7 bound to both Neu5Gc-glycans and their modified derivatives with a modest preference for Sia2\u20133. hemagglutinin-esterase ectodomain (residues 19\u2013388) with an inactivated esterase. binding shows sensitivity to the /-linkage of the linker. binding shows sensitivity to the /-linkage of the linker. b, average ranked binding of BCoV H+E0-Fc to 9OAc-Sia on both arrays. pretreatment of arrays with freshly prepared 2 mm sodium metaperiodate in PBS, pH 6.5, but not mock treatment abolishes binding of lectins and antibodies to unmodified sialoglycans (Sia) binding to divalent glycans bearing 9OAc-Sia was better than to any of the monovalent glycans with Neu5Gc9Ac2\u20133NA2 (glycan 53) ranked 100 and Neu5,9Ac22\u20136NA2 (glycan 38) ranked 35.6. binding to sialoglycans with Type 1 glycan on Array 1 was very low. the 9-O-acetylated Sia (9OAc-Sia) is resistant to such periodate oxidation (41), thereby leaving the 9OAc-Sia intact. we optimized the periodate oxidation protocol accordingly and found that 2 mm periodate in PBS, pH 6.5, provides better stability compared with conventional sodium acetate, pH 5.5. the optimal periodate concentration was 2 mm, with further increases resulting in glycan degradation. glycans showed resistance to periodate treatment compared with sialoglycans with the corresponding non-sulfated skeletons. we also tested some animal lectins with known Sia-dependent binding. on Array 1, binding was not Sia-dependent, whereas on Array 2, there was very weak binding to divalent (glycans 39 and 50) and short monovalent glycans (Sia2\u20133/6Lac, glycans 31 and 34), with some preference for the monovalent Sia2\u20133LNT. possible explanations include lack of an unknown optimal binding ligand found only on CD24, contribution of a CD24 peptide component to binding. human Siglec-9-Fc shows preference for Kdn-containing glycans (even if internal) and for unmodified Sia (non-9-O-acetylated) and Sia2\u20136 linkage on several skeletons. binding of the human Siglec-9-Fc chimera to both arrays was assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1. the average rank is presented as a heat map of all tested glycans. Array 1 has two examples of di-/trisialylated probes that differ only in the glycan linker used for immobilization. glycans 41 versus 64 or glycan 42 versus 65 carry the same linker that is differentially attached to the glycan probes. human Siglec-9-Fc showed a strong preference for unmodified Sia. binding was abolished when a longer linker was used to conjugate the glycans to the slide on Array 1. this may suggest that the binding of this animal lectin, human Siglec-9-Fc, is specifically negatively affected by the flexibility of the glycans on the printed array. binding of human Siglec-9 shows differential binding on Array 1 compared with Array 2. but even within the same array, we observe a differential binding pattern as a result of differential immobilization chemistries. binding of human Siglec-9 to Arrays 1 and 2 may be a result of the protein cross-reacting with all Sias. glycans are printed on NHS-derivatized surfaces as in Array 2 (6). glycans are printed on epoxide versus NHS-derived slides. if glycans are printed on epoxy slides, siglec-9 binds with broad specificity at higher concentrations. a direct comparison of the RFU of lectins binding to pairs of highly similar sialoglycans on both arrays. a, direct comparison of the RFU of lectins binding to pairs of highly similar sialoglycans on both arrays. glycan pairs with exact terminal structure but different linker and slide coat. can attachment chemistries, array processing protocols, and extent of coverage of glycan library. glycan arrays have several other levels of complexity. glycan arrays have several other levels of complexity. glycan arrays have several other levels of complexity. heterogeneous glycans may result in enhanced binding affinity compared with the individual components in microarray experiments. glycan microarray data from individual glycan microarrays must be analyzed and interpreted with respect to the collection of glycans on each array. glycan arrays were designed and constructed in separate laboratories with different emphases and on different printed surfaces. the sialic acid derivatives and sialylation methodologies were from one single laboratory (22\u201332), ensuring comparability in this key aspect of the arrays. glycans of Array 1 were individually synthesized, purified, and printed by contact printing on epoxide-activated glass slides (15). the reducing end monosaccharide of Array 2 glycans is in an open chain form. in contrast, the reducing ends of the glycans of Array 1 were maintained in their naturally occurring ring form. the differences are ranked, based on the differences in their underlying glycan skeletons. binding was detected by applying a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. slides were then scanned and fluorescent signals were analyzed. each glycan probe was printed in four replicates, and the signals were averaged. structures compared with only four underlying structures on Array 2. SNA bound better to 9-O-acetylated-Sia compared with the unmodified Sia attached to the same glycan structures. the preferred binding motif is a sialylated trisaccharide (Sia2\u20136LacNAc) selective recognition of Sia2\u20136-glycans by biotinylated-SNA (tested at 20 g/ml, Scanner 2). b and c, differential selective recognition of Sia2\u20133-glycans by MAL-1 (b) and MAL-2 (c) to both arrays. d, ranked binding of all plant lectins on both arrays. the overall lower binding to Sia2\u20136LNT compared with Sia2\u20136LNnT/NA2 is probably due to the different linkages of the underlying galactosides (Sia2\u20136Gal1\u20134GlcNAc-R in Sia2\u20136LNT versus Sia2\u20136LNnT/NA2). acetyl groups at both the C-5 amino group and the C-9 hydroxyl group of sialic acid glycans 5, 6, 9, and 13 ranked 95, 70, 59, and 68 respectively. despite differences in relative fluorescence units (RFU) values, the data from Array 1 and Array 2 complement each other. inspection of ranked glycans indicated that on Array 1, MAL-1 shows very weak binding to Sia2\u20133-glycans but with specificity toward Sia2\u20133LacNAc. this is destabilized when the underlying glycan is sulfated (Sia2\u20133-6S-LacNAc; glycan 12 versus 62 ranked 100 and 6, respectively) the top five ranked glycans on the LNnT skeleton showed optimal binding to the modified Sias. the binding pattern is similar to previous analysis conducted with different buffer conditions. the lack of Sia2\u20133Core1-R on Array 2 provides a logical explanation for the lack of MAL-2 binding on this array. some lectins require divalent cations for optimal binding. we therefore assayed MAL-2 on Array 1 with Buffer 2 (BisTris, pH 6.0, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NaCl) polyclonal antibody pChGc recognition was not greatly affected by the various underlying skeletons or the terminal sialyl linkages. binding was affected by the various underlying skeletons, the terminal sialyl linkages, and most significantly, the Sia. polyclonal pChGc antibody preferentially bound to sialoglycans with unmodified Neu5Gc (ranked 100 to 24) or Neu5GcOAc with O-acetylation on the glycolyl (ranked 75 to 12) and lack of binding to glycans with O-methylation on the glycolyl in Neu5Gc (ranked 6 to 0) bridoma supernatant tested at 1:50 dilution, Scanner 2). d, average ranked binding of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies on both arrays tested at two concentrations each. mChGc6-1 and mChGc2-7 showed differential recognition on the two arrays with strong binding to Array 1. mChGc2\u20137 resembled pChGc and showed a broader binding profile on both arrays compared with mChGc6-1. on Array 2, this antibody showed minimal binding and mostly bound to Neu5Gc-glycans with unmodified Sia. ly possess sialate-9-O-acetylesterases as receptor-destroying enzymes. we tested the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc, an Fc fusion protein of the bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase ectodomain (residues 19\u2013388) with an inactivated esterase (H+E0, containing a Ser40 Ala substitution in the active site. lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc is a viral fusion protein of bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) ectodomain with an inactivated esterase (35) was tested at 50 and 40 g/ml. b, average ranked binding of BCoV H+E0-Fc to 9OAc-Sia on both arrays. binding to divalent glycans bearing 9OAc-Sia was better than to monovalent glycans with Neu5Gc9Ac2\u20133NA2 (glycan 53) ranked 100 and Neu5,9Ac22\u20136NA2 (glycan 38) ranked 35.6. binding to sialoglycans with Type 1 glycan on Array 1 was very low. the modified Sia has two fewer hydroxyl group-attached carbons (carbons 8 and 9) but maintains the Sia negative charge. this allows investigation of the specificity for sialic acid itself as opposed to simply a charged monosaccharide. we optimized the periodate oxidation protocol accordingly and found that 2 mm periodate in PBS, pH 6.5, provides better stability compared with conventional sodium acetate, pH 5.5. pChGc analysis revealed that sulfated glycans retain binding even after periodate treatment. pChGc can still bind to the truncated Sia while stabilized by the sulfated groups in these glycans. glycans showed resistance to periodate treatment compared with sialoglycans. we tested human Fc-fusion proteins of both L1 (36) and CHL1 (37) for binding to glycans on both arrays using the optimal Buffer 2 conditions. both showed a dose-dependent binding to sialylated CD24 by traditional ELISA. on Array 1, there was very weak binding to divalent (glycans 39 and 50) or short monovalent glycans (Sia2\u20133/6Lac, glycans 31 and 34 human Siglec-9-Fc showed very low binding to Array 2. binding is sensitive to Sia type, Sia linkage, underlying glycan structure, and the linkage and length of the glycan linker. binding is sensitive to Sia type, Sia linkage, underlying glycan structure, and the linkage and length of the glycan linker. b, average ranked binding of human Siglec-9-Fc to Array 1 developed either with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-goat anti-human IgG (tested at 40 g/ml on both arrays, Scanner 2). the average rank is presented as a heat map of all tested glycans (red, white, and blue represent the maximum, 50th percentile, and minimum, respectively). glycans 33\u201336, -linked, ranked 52\u201357; glycans 16, 15, 9, and 10, -linked, ranked 18 to 0; Cy3-goat anti-human IgG; Fig. 4b and supplemental Fig. 2c. this preference for the -linkage of the linker is also observed with the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc. binding of human Siglec-9 shows differential binding on Array 1 compared with Array 2. this is consistent with other comparisons where Array 2 and Array 1 generate the same broad specificity determination. the low binding to Array 2 may be due to the absence of the preferred glycans. Array 2 with lower binding levels demonstrated the antibody's preference for different derivatives of Neu5Gc and linkage position to underlying structures. this is consistent with the behavior of human Siglec-9 on other arrays, all showing the preferred binding specificity for sulfated sialyl-Lex and related glycans. this is also consistent with the behavior of human Siglec-9 on other arrays. if Array 2 glycans are printed on epoxy slides, Siglec-9 binds with broad specificity at higher concentrations. other additional factors could generate differences in presentation of glycans for binding to GBPs, including the effect of the open chain monosaccharide at the reducing end. cross-comparison of glycan arrays suggests mining data should be done with caution. glycan arrays have several other levels of complexity. diversity in glycan attachment chemistries, array processing protocols, and extent of coverage of the glycan library. heterogeneous glycans, prepared by mixing two distinct oligosaccharides, may result in enhanced binding affinity compared with the individual components in microarray experiments. glycan microarray data must be analyzed and interpreted with respect to the collection of glycans on each array. glycans of Array 1 were synthesized, purified, and printed by contact printing on epoxide-activated glass slides (15) both sets of glycans were covalently linked to an activated glass slide surface through a primary amino group. glycan arrays were designed and constructed in separate laboratories with different emphases and on different printed surfaces. glycans were purified from individual reactions, structurally identified, and printed on NHS-activated glass slides (11). glycans were then purified from the individual reactions, structurally identified, and printed on NHS-activated glass slides (11). glycans differ both in the structures of the linkers and in the fact that the reducing end monosaccharide of Array 2 glycans is in an open chain form. glycans as found attached to each array surface Assay and Analysis of Slide Arrays We compared binding patterns of several plant, vertebrate, and viral sialic acid-recognizing proteins to the sialoglycans on both arrays at several optimal concentrations. the data generated were then compared between the different arrays. Binding was influenced by the type of Sia as well as by the underlying glycan structure. on Array 1, SNA bound better to 9-O-acetylated-Sia compared with the unmodified Sia attached to the same underlying glycan structures. biotinylated lectins were assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1 (as detailed under \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d) and detected with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-streptavidin. b and c, differential selective recognition of Sia2\u20133-glycans by MAL-1 (b) and MAL-2 (c) to both arrays (tested at 40 g/ml, Scanner 2). the sia2\u20136Lac lacks an N-acetyl group on the third monosaccharide from the non-reducing end. the sugar is found in the form of a Glcitol (an open chain rather than the ring structure; Table 3), probably destabilizing binding. the overall lower binding to Sia2\u20136LNT compared with Sia2\u20136LNnT/NA2 is probably due to the different linkages of the underlying galacto glycan 12, with terminal Neu5Ac9Lt, or with the smaller methyl group (glycan 8, with terminal Neu5Ac9Me) dramatically reduced binding efficiency (glycans 5, 8, and 12 ranked 95, 62, and 55, respectively) the N-acetyl group at the 5-position was similarly optimal for binding (i.e. glycan 5) because replacing it with N-glycolyl (glycan 6), N-methylglyco many of the Sia2\u20133-glycans with underlying Type 2 glycans were bound. Array 2 showed stronger binding with MAL-1 specifically for Sia2\u20133-glycan. the lower level of binding to Array 1 compared with Array 2 may result from various factors. MAL-1 does not bind to Sia2\u20133Lactose, consistent with its preference for an underlying LacNAc structure. the top five ranked glycans on the LNnT skeleton showed optimal binding to the modified Sias. the binding pattern is similar to previous analysis conducted with different buffer conditions. a comparable binding pattern was observed when the same slide was scanned and analyzed with two different scanners (supplemental Fig. 1b; R2 = 0.92) these findings suggest that the optimal ligand for MAL-2 is Sia2\u20133Gal1\u20133GalNAc1-R (Sia2\u20133Core1-R) it also raises the possibility that the binding might be further stabilized with additional glycans or amino acids. the comparison of both arrays by these common sialic acid-binding lectins showed interesting differences that can be interpreted as due to suboptimal presentation of glycans. differences in MAL-1 binding to its ligand, Sia2\u20133Gal1\u20134GlcNAc, and/or due to the absence of optimal ligand. on Array 2, binding was affected by the various underlying skeletons, the terminal sialyl linkages, and most significantly, the Sia type. pChGc antibody preferentially bound to sialoglycans with unmodified Neu5Gc (ranked 100 to 24) or Neu5GcOAc with O-acetylation on the glycolyl (ranked 75 to 12) b and c, differential selective recognition of Neu5Gc-bearing glycans by two chicken monoclonal anti-Neu5Gc antibodies on both arrays. the average rank is presented as a heat map of all tested glycans. only the Neu5Gc-glycoconjugates are presented. mChGc2\u20137 resembled pChGc and showed a broader binding profile on both arrays compared with mChGc6-1. mChGc2-7 showed strong binding to 9-O-acetylated Sia. mChGc6-1 and mChGc2-7 showed strong binding to the glycan 69. BCoVs use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids as receptors. correspondingly possess sialate-9-O-acetylesterases as receptor-destroying enzymes. binding shows sensitivity to /-linkage of linker with preference for -linkage as in Sia2\u20133Core1/-R structures. a selective recognition of 9-O-acetylated Sias (9OAc-Sia) by the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc. binding of the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc shows that the preferred ligand has terminal 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. glycan 53 versus 39 ranked 100 versus 1.6, glycan 21 versus 6 ranked 5.3 versus 0, and glycan 20 versus 5 ranked 9.8 versus 0. binding to divalent glycans bearing 9OAc-Sia was better than to any of the monovalent glycans with Neu5Gc9Ac2\u20133NA2 (glycan 53) ranked 100. glycans on the slides were treated with mild periodate oxidation. it would specifically truncate the polyhydroxyl side chain of Sia, leaving a reactive aldehyde that is then further reduced by sodium borohydride. the resulting modified Sia has two fewer hydroxyl group-attached carbons (carbons 8 and 9) but maintains the Sia negative charge. this allows investigation of the specificity for sialic acid itself as opposed to simply ate treatment did not reduce binding of the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc. the polyclonal chicken anti-Neu5Gc antibody shows reduction in binding to periodate-treated Sia except for 9OAc-Sia. pChGc analysis further revealed that the neu5Gc-containing sulfated glycans retain binding even after periodate treatment. members of the L1 family of neural cell adhesion molecules (L1-CAMs) are widely expressed in the developing nervous system. it was reported that CD24 and L1 cooperate with each other through binding of L1 to 2\u20133-linked Sias on CD24, thereby contributing to neurite outgrowth. binding is sensitive to Sia type, Sia linkage, underlying glycan structure, and the linkage and length of the glycan linker. human Siglec-9-Fc showed very low binding to Array 2 (Fig. 4, a\u2013c) binding is sensitive to Sia type, Sia linkage, underlying glycan structure, and the linkage and length of the glycan linker. lectins were assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1. binding of the human Siglec-9-Fc chimera to both arrays was assayed. b, average ranked binding (as detailed in the legend to Fig. 1d) of human Siglec-9-Fc to Array 1 developed either with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-goat anti-human IgG. Binding of human Siglec-9-Fc to Array 1 Core 1 structures significantly affected binding efficiencies of human Siglec-9. glycans 33\u201336, -linked, ranked 52\u201357; glycans 16, 15, 9, and 10, -linked, ranked 18 to 0; Cy3-goat anti-human IgG. binding of human Siglec-9-Fc is specific to various sialoglycans. it is also sensitive to the linkage and length of the glycan linker attaching the glycoconjugate to the slide surface. this differential recognition with stronger and wider recognition by Array 1 compared with Array 2 is hence probably due to the different presentation of glycans on the arrays. the low binding to Array 2 may be due to the absence of the preferred glycans. this is consistent with other comparisons where Array 2 and Array 1 generate the same broad specificity determination. i.e. both arrays showed specificity of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies for Neu5Gc-terminating glycans. human Siglec-9-Fc and the three chicken anti-Neu5Gc IgYs ranked these pairs binding to each array. such analyses indicate that there is no direct correlation with relative binding of glycan pairs, despite the fact that they share the same terminal structures. if Array 2 glycans are printed on epoxy slides, Siglec-9 binds with broad specificity at higher concentrations. the family of sialic acids with analysis mainly focused on terminal glycan motif recognition. this study demonstrates the power of glycan microarrays in analyzing GBP binding to the diversity of sialoglycans in nature. this first ever direct cross-comparison suggests that mining of data in current glycan array databases should be done with caution. glycan microarray data from individual glycan microarrays must be analyzed and interpreted with respect to the collection of glycans on each array. this is analogous to the limitations of gene microarrays comprised of a collection of nucleic acid sequences from a small, random fraction of the human genome. 147 glycoconjugates, including 137 sialosides generated by combinations of 16 different Sias with 14 unique underlying glycan skeletons. the terminal Sias encompassed the three common forms (Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn) and some of their hydroxyl-substituted derivatives with O-acetyl (at position C-9, C-8, C-7, C-5, or C-5-glycolyl the glycans of Array 1 were individually synthesized, purified, and printed by contact printing on epoxide-activated glass slides (15). glycans of Array 2 were synthesized using a combinatorial approach using three fluorescently derivatized glycans as precursors and combinations of mannose derivatives, pyruvate, and appropriate enzymes (11) these glycans were then purified from the individual reactions, structurally identified, and bifunctional fluorescent tag 2-amino-(N-aminoethyl) benzamide. TABLE 3. Combined summary of overall characteristics of glycoconjugates, sialosides, Sia types, underlying glycan skeletons, and linkers on the two sialoglycan arrays. we compared binding patterns of a well known plant lectin SNA to the sialoglycans. binding was influenced by the type of Sia as well as by the underlying glycan structure. on Array 1, SNA bound better to 9-O-acetylated-Sia compared with the unmodified Sia. binding patterns were also observed when we used two different contact printers to generate Array 1 (supplemental Fig. 1a; R2 = 0.99) or when the same slide was scanned and analyzed with two different scanners. d, ranked binding of all plant lectins on both arrays. on Array 2, SNA shows a clear skeleton preference to Sia2\u20136LNnT or Sia2\u20136NA2 over Sia2\u20136Lac or Sia2\u20136LNT. the sia2\u20136Lac lacks an N-acetyl group on the third monosaccharide from the non-reducing end. a methyl modification at position 8 abolished binding. the acetyl group at position 9 added stability. the acetyl group at position 9 significantly reduced binding efficiency. similar results were observed when the same slide was scanned and analyzed with two different scanners. on Array 1, MAL-1 shows very weak binding to Sia2\u20133-glycans but with specificity toward Sia2\u20133LacNAc (glycans 12, 11, 1, and 2 ranked 100, 31, 30, and 27, respectively) MAL-1 does not bind to Sia2\u20133Lactose, consistent with its preference for an underlying LacNAc structure. the top five ranked glycans on the LNnT skeleton showed optimal binding to the modified Sias, including Kdn5,9Ac2, Neu5Ac9Me, Neu5Ac8Me. glycans 16, 15, 9, and 10, -linked, ranked 100, 67, 66, and 38; glycans 33\u201336, -linked, ranked 5\u201310. a comparable binding pattern was observed when the same slide was scanned and analyzed with two different scanners. this suggests that the optimal ligand for MAL-2 is Sia2\u20133Gal1\u20133GalNAc1-R (Sia2\u20133Core1-R \u20133Gal (supplemental Fig. 2a), and with an overall stronger signal in each glycan (by 5-fold; supplemental Fig. 2b) however, these buffer conditions did not affect the binding intensity or pattern of SNA. this did not improve on low binding of MAL-1 to Array 1 (data not shown) polyclonal antibody pChGc recognition was not greatly affected by the various underlying skeletons or the terminal sialyl linkages. binding was affected by the various underlying skeletons, the terminal sialyl linkages, and most significantly, the Sia type. on Array 2, binding was affected by the various underlying skeletons, the terminal sialyl linkages and most significantly, the sia type. chicken IgY anti-Neu5Gc antibodies were assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1 and detected with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-donkey anti-chicken IgY. a, selective recognition of Neu5Gc-bearing glycans by monospecific chicken polyclonal anti-Neu5Gc antibodies to both arrays. mChGc6-1 showed greater binding to unmodified Neu5Gc-glycans over the 9-O-acetylated ones with a preference toward Sia2\u20133 over Sia2\u20136 or Sia2\u20138 linkages to the underlying skeletons. mChGc2\u20137 resembled pChGc and showed a broader binding profile on both arrays compared with mChGc6-1. differential binding patterns of mChGc6-1 and mChGc2-7 to the two arrays may result from differential presentation of Neu5Gc-glycans on the two arrays that might negatively affect stable binding to Array 2. for example, less dense and more mobile glycans might reduce bivalent binding. binding shows sensitivity to the /-linkage of the linker. that is in contrast to MAL-2 that prefers the -linkage on the same glycans. selective recognition of 9-O-acetylated Sias (9OAc-Sia) by the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc. binding of the viral lectin BCoV H+E0-Fc shows that the preferred ligand has terminal 9-O-acetylated Sia with preference toward Sia2\u20133 linkage over Sia2\u20136. binding to divalent glycans bearing 9OAc-Sia was better than to any of the monovalent glycans with 9OAc-Sia2\u20136LNnT (glycan 53) ranked 100 and Neu5,9 on Array 2, no binding was observed for sialoglycans with other types of modified Sia (such as Kdn9Ac or Kdn5,9Ac2, Neu5Ac9Me, and Neu5Ac9Lt) glycans on the slides were treated with mild periodate oxidation, which would specifically truncate the polyhydroxyl side chain of Sia, leaving a reactive aldehyde that is then further reduced by sodium borohydride sialylated glycans with C-9-unprotected sialic acid showed resistance to periodate treatment compared with sialoglycans with the corresponding non-sulfated skeletons. binding to the resistant 9OAc-Sia remains largely unchanged. differential Array Recognition by Human Sialic Acid-binding Lectins CHL-1 and Siglec-9 To expand our comparison, we also tested some animal lectins with known Sia-dependent binding on both arrays. we also tested some animal lectins with known Sia-dependent binding on both arrays. two arrays that present diverse sets of sialosides do not show strong binding by a GBP that is known to recognize Sias in a biological context. possible explanations include lack of an unknown optimal binding ligand found only on CD24, contribution of a CD24 peptide component to binding, or failure to mimic a unique \u201cclustered saccharide patch\u201d (47) that may be found on CD24. a binding of the human Siglec-9-Fc chimera to both arrays was assayed using the protocol optimized for Array 1 and detected with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-goat anti-human IgG. b, average ranked binding of human Siglec-9-Fc to Array 1 developed either with 1.5 g/ml Cy3-goat anti-human IgG. glycans 33\u201336, -linked, ranked 52\u201357; glycans 16, 15, 9, and 10, -linked, ranked 18 to 0; Cy3-goat anti-human IgG; Fig. 4b and supplemental Fig. 2c. glycans 33\u201336, -linked, ranked 52\u201357; glycans 16, 15, 9, and 10, -linked, ranked 18 to 0; Cy3-goat anti the binding of human Siglec-9-Fc is specific to various sialoglycans. it is also sensitive to the linkage and length of the glycan linker attaching the glycoconjugate to the slide surface. this may suggest that the binding of human Siglec-9-Fc is specifically negatively affected by the flexibility of the glycans on the printed array. the interaction of Siglec-9 with Array 2 terminal Sias may be less stabilized due to the differences in linkers and NHS-derivatized substrate. however, the low binding to Array 2 may be due to the absence of the preferred glycans. this is consistent with other comparisons where Array 2 and Array 1 generate the same broad specificity determination. glycans share the same terminal di- or trisaccharide on both arrays. binding of human Siglec-9-Fc and the three chicken anti-Neu5Gc IgYs differs in their immobilization chemistries. if Array 2 glycans are printed on epoxy slides, Siglec-9 binds with broad specificity at higher concentrations. c, direct comparison of the ranked glycan pairs for Array 1 versus Array 2. analysis mainly focused on terminal glycan motif recognition. this first ever direct cross-comparison suggests that mining of data in current glycan array databases should be done with caution. glycan microarray data should be viewed as experiments and not definitive assays. glycan arrays are comprised of a collection of nucleic acid sequences from a small, random fraction of the human genome. glycan arrays have several other levels of complexity.
