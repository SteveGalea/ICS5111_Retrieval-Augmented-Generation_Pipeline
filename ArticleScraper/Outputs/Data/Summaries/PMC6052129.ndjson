{"summary": "lactation can be classified into three main steps: early lactation where milk is produced in increasing trends, peak production where energy balance is negative, and late lactation where persistency of lactation is important. elucidating the genes influencing each lactation time point can assist the animal breeders to accelerate the genetic improvement of dairy animals in breeding programs. meta-analysis and machine learning have the potential to uncover the common biosignature among mammals (Shekoofa et al., 2014; Ebrahimie et al., 2018; Farhadian et al., 2018; Sharifi et al., 2018). we examined gene expression pattern of mammary gland in early and late lactation of mentioned species. downstream analyses including gene ontology and gene network were performed for better understanding of the identified signature. the datasets belonged to three different species including Wallaby, Rat, and Cow. t DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies) and Quantile method were applied to normalize the data. the second dataset (GSE19055) contained 60 mammary biopsy samples in nine different time points from multiparous Holstein dairy cattle breed (n = 8) the samples were collected at 30 (n = 7) and 15 (n = 8) days before parturition. probe-to-gene mapping was carried out to convert probe-set expression levels into gene expression levels according to the corresponding chip datasets. the IQR-based method is more robust and biologically more acceptable than the mean-based method. the \u201ccombining P-value\u201d was selected for meta-analysis. the method sums the logarithm of the p-values across k studies for a given gene. pathway Studio has a powerful database of mammalian gene/protein/small-RNA interactions. downstream targets that are regulated by at least two or more of the selected entities in the network diagram are found by common target algorithm. attribute weighting models were run for each species separately. pre- and post-peak milk production status was set as the target (label) variable. the commonality of discriminating in three species was identified as species-independent signature of lactation process. dataset collection and data preprocessing gene expression Omnibus database1 was used as a source of transcriptomic data collection. datasets with biological samples for both pre- and post-peak milk production as well as their raw gene expression and annotation data were collected. second dataset (GSE19055) contained 60 mammary biopsy samples in nine different time points from multiparous Holstein dairy cattle breed (n = 8) samples were collected at 30 (n = 7) and 15 (n = 8) days before parturition. samples belonging to 30 and 15 days before parturition were excluded from the analysis. gene matching was carried out to convert probe-set expression levels into gene expression levels according to the corresponding chip datasets. the ID with the largest interquartile range (IQR) of expression value was selected to represent the gene symbol. the IQR-based method is more robust and biologically more acceptable than the mean-based method. the \u201ccombining P-value\u201d was selected for meta-analysis of the current work. the method sums the logarithm of the p-values across k studies for a given gene. pathway Studio has a powerful database of mammalian gene/protein/small-RNA interactions. downstream targets that are regulated by at least two or more of the selected entities in the network diagram are found by common target algorithm. attribute weighting models were run for each species separately. pre- and post-peak milk production status was set as the target (label) variable. the commonality of discriminating in three species was identified as species-independent signature of lactation process. a total of 31 DEGs (24 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) were discovered different between the pre- and post-peak milk production. the top up-regulated gene in pre-peak was ATP5B (P = 0.009), while the top down-regulated gene was CTNNB1 (P = 0.01). 0.011 616317 STMN1 Stathmin 1 Protein Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton 0.008 445425 TKT Transketolase Protein Cytoplasm 0.014 507924 LAS1L LAS1 like, ribosome biogenesis factor Transcription Factor Nucleus 0.021 281418 PPIA Peptidylprolyl isomerase A Receptor Cytoplasm 0.021 531676 KDELR2 KDEL endo the two top significantly enriched BPs were single-organism cellular process (GO:0044763, P =0.000192) and single-organism process (GO:0031982, P = 3.47E-05) the two top significantly enriched terms were vesicle (GO:0031982, P = 3.47E-05) and extracellular exosome (GO:0070062, P = 3.47) the significantly enriched GO terms of the DEGs are reported in Table 3.

Features with weights closer to 1 show the importance of each variable in regard to target label. an attribute was assumed important if the assigned weight was higher than 0.7 by a certain attribute weighting algorithm. the results of meta-analysis showed 31 DEGs and 11 genes were not in any of three datasets. the organism weight compare with DEGs is low. there are 9 common genes between rat, wallaby, and cow. the complete list for all common genes is shown in Supplementary Data Sheet S10. the number of attribute weighting algorithms that indicated the DEGs algorithm weighting RSU1 5 MRPS18B 3 PPIA 3 TAGLN2 3 ATP5B 3 VAMP8 3. the number of genes has at least three weighting models in rat, wallaby, and cow is 95, 9, and 34 respectively. there are 9 common genes between rat and bovine; 5 common genes between rat and wallaby and only 1 common gene between cow and wallaby. the three selected species in this study have a range of lactation processes. the up-regulated gene with the lowest P-value was ATP5B. this gene has been used as a housekeeping gene in the gene expression analysis of mammary gland samples. this gene has been used as a housekeeping gene in the gene expression analysis. a complex process take place in mammary gland where milk fat content is higher at post-peak than the early stage of lactation. the significantly lower expression of LPL pre-peak is in accordance with the findings of Green et al. (1983) and Kwek et al.(2007). the biological importance of single-organism cellular process is in the development of mammary gland alveolus. the biological function of the single-organism process is related to epithelial cell proliferation involved in mammary gland duct elongation. the important role of these three hub genes on the milk production was confirmed by all of the algorithms used to construct the networks. the RNF43 had negative regulation effect on Wnt signaling pathway and decline the production of milk at later days of lactation. some genes may go into considerable or negligible modifications in expression. genes related to the development of the mammary gland, proliferation and differentiation of cells and genes related to the improvement of immune system were mainly altered in their expression between the specified time-points of the lactation. our study suggests that the deGs influence on milk production by improvement of immune system and cell differentiation. the developed meta-analysis signature of lactation is species-independent and is common among species. the employed approach in this study can be verified in future similar studies.
