{"summary": "the number of new cases is declining but an end to the epidemic is not in sight. the world health organization registered about 27,500 cases thus far. it will probably take several more months until the largest EVD outbreak in history can be declared over. in an EVD outbreak it is essential to isolate all patients and their contacts as early as possible. MSF immediately sent a specialized team into the affected region. the director-general, Dr. Margaret Chan, had been accused of alarmism. the secret outbreak in Sierra Leone had sparked a smoldering wildfire in Guinea and liberia. at least 4600 people died between June and October 2014 alone. the EVD outbreak must constitute a public health risk to other states. earlier EVD epidemics, which occurred in the remote villages of Equatorial Africa, had always burnt out after two to three months. the governments of Conakry, Monrovia, and Freetown for their part had no interest in being burdened with travel and trade restrictions. the common interest of local governments and WHO representatives to play down the problem resulted in fatal negligence. 3000 soldiers were to construct treatment centers in liberia for 1700 EVD patients. but progress in international response was sluggish. officials discussed protective equipment, disinfectants, tent constructions and liability issues. genetic research suggests that Ebola virus had been present in the west africa rainforest for more than ten years before the current present outbreak. the migration of Equatorial African fruit bats, which are regarded as a possible source of the epidemic, had been observed for some time. the number of EVD cases would rise up to 1.4 million by mid-january 2015. the CDC estimated 550,000 recorded cases and a factor of 2.5 for underreporting. the author of this article vehemently disputed those figures at that time. mobile Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) have proved their usefulness during earlier outbreaks. the current epidemic showed that isolation at home is not feasible under basic living conditions. simple infusions, to replenish the water and salt losses from fever and diarrhea, can save many patients. 2800 soldiers built 17 ETCs in liberia, but there was no medical staff to run the centers. the only US facility that ever came into operation is a small, high-tech hospital in monrovia, designed exclusively for the treatment of aid workers. people with uncommon fevers are treated by an old woman in a hut outside the village. this simple rule of behavior is the main reason why new infections have dropped since October 2014. in liberia and Sierra Leone, alone, the number of EVD cases would rise up to 1.4 million by mid-january 2015. in highly contagious virus diseases, every patient infects a large number of other individuals. the average number of persons infected by one patient is the basic reproduction number, R0 (\u201cR-naught\u201d) for measles, one of the most contagious diseases, R0 is approximately 15. EVD is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. the first unit of the European Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) program started operations in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou in the first days of April 2014. 2800 soldiers built 17 ETCs in Liberia, but there was no medical staff to run the centers. the only US facility that came into operation is a small, high-tech hospital in Monrovia. 4.1. Integration of Epidemic Preparedness into International Development Policy Ebola virus was able to spread in Western Africa so massively because the national health services and infrastructures failed. a faster and more effective intervention would be the integration of epidemic prevention into all areas of development aid. the EVD outbreak in west africa alerts us that similar alarm bells for the global threat of pandemics are urgently needed. the CDC in Atlanta operates with 15,000 employees and an annual budget of US$ 6.9 billion. for africa, neither a common center for disease control nor a decentralized network equivalent exists. CDC should run its own, state-of-the-art laboratories and intervention teams. the fast setup of ETCs, in sufficient numbers, is crucial for the early containment of an outbreak. in western africa neither WHO, the international community of states nor single countries were able to implement this. an international operational command develops and practices scenario-based, generic plans for medical crises and acts as a coordinator in case of an outbreak. a network of cooperating organizations providing technical and logistical support (e.g., UNDAC, ECHO, IFRC, national military and technical aid units) national voluntary aid worker pools from relevant professions should be adequately prepared through continuous education. the EVD outbreak in west africa alerts us that similar alarm bells for the global threat of pandemics are urgently needed. the CDC in Atlanta operates with 15,000 employees and an annual budget of US$ 6.9 billion. for africa, neither a common center for disease control nor a decentralized network equivalent exists. an african CDC should run its own, state-of-the-art laboratories and intervention teams. the fast setup of ETCs, in sufficient numbers, is crucial for the early containment of an outbreak. in western Africa neither WHO, the international community of states nor single countries were able to implement this. the medical response unit proposes four main components: an international operational command. it develops scenarios-based, generic plans for medical crises. consultants, trainers and field leaders can be called up from this pool. the medical response unit should act in conjunction with aid organizations in the affected region. in the case of an outbreak, the concerned country and regional offices set the pace of the WHO response. the main responsibility for epidemic control was transferred from WHO onto the member states. this made sense in light of the SARS epidemic of 2003, which had been the reason for the 2005 revisions of the IHR, because mainly rich countries were affected. epidemic control in developing countries is our last line of defense. in this war, epidemic control in developing countries is our last line of defense."}
