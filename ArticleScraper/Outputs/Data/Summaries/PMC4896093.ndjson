{"summary": "multiplex real time RT-PCR helps in simultaneous detection of multiple viruses saving cost, time and labour. commercially available multiplex real time RT-PCR kits are very expensive. the aim of the study was to develop a cost effective multiplex real time RT-PCR for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses. custom primer and probe mix was found to be comparable to the FTD assay with good concordance but was much cheaper and the time taken for reporting was only 29 min more."}
