{"summary": "the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors on dengue transmission in Puerto Rico is understudied. the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors that affect dengue and other arboviruses' transmission is understudied. an estimated 2.5 billion people (40% of the world's population) in over 100 countries are at risk of infection. approximately 975 million of these live in urban areas in tropical and subtropical countries. dengue is classified as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) that disproportionally affects low-income and underprivileged populations. the risk of developing DHF appears to increase with a secondary infection with a different serotype. in endemic areas in Asia and the Americas, the burden of dengue is approximately 1,300 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per million population [11], 12. in 2010, more than one million cases were reported to the pan American health organization. DEN-4 epidemics in 1986 and 1989 followed by the emergence of DHF in 1986 and high incidences of DHF and DSS in subsequent years. in nonepidemic years, reported cases of dengue range from 3,400 to 7,000 per year. in 2010, Puerto Rico experienced the largest outbreak of dengue in its history, recording over 21,000 cases. global warming is predicted to lead to an increase in dengue incidence and distribution in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Thailand by the year 2100. global warming is predicted to lead to an increase in populations at risk of dengue by the year 2100 and could have a perceptible impact on vector-borne diseases. climate change and climate variability have the greatest adverse effect on small island states. the classic clinical picture of ZIKV infection resembles that of other arboviruses found in the locations where dengue occurs. Symptoms include fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and maculopapular rash; thus differential diagnosis is difficult. infection can be asymptomatic, can result in acute febrile illness with rash [33], and is associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [34] and severe thrombocytop the dry season typically lasts from December to April and the wet season runs from May to November. hurricanes, high rainfall, landslides, and droughts have been major natural disturbances on the island. a former Spanish colony, Puerto Rico was acquired by the united states in 1898. urban expansion leads to high densities of humans exposed to the mosquito vector Ae. aegypti. water that is left stored in the open can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry dengue fever. increased air travel and globalization of trade significantly contributed to the introduction of all dengue virus serotypes to most population centers of the world. Zika Virus Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging vector-borne Flavivirus, was isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest in 1947 [31] the classic clinical picture of ZIKV infection resembles that of other arboviruses found in the locations where dengue occurs. symptoms include fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and maculopapular rash; thus differential diagnosis is difficult. the main island is 110 miles long with a mountainous central area surrounded by sandy beaches and coral reef. the dry season typically lasts from December to April and the wet season runs from May to November. hurricanes, high rainfall, landslides, and droughts have been major natural disturbances. the recent economic crisis has resulted in an increase in immigration into the united states. the island is an archipelago comprised of six islands with a land area of 3,421 square miles. the main island is 110 miles long with a mountainous central area surrounded by sandy beaches and coral reef along almost the entire coastal area. population had a high school degree, 27.0% a bachelor's degree or more, and 10.3% an advanced degree. in 2009, 39.5% of the civilian population 16 years of age and over was employed. most work for educational and social services (21.5%) followed by Retail Trade (11.5%) and Manufacturing (11.2%). literature selection and review process based on preselected criteria. inclusion criteria included studies that provided no analysis or description of political, social, and economic conditions, ecology or climate. unpublished and published studies that analyzed or described the role of extrinsic dengue transmission factors in Puerto Rico. most of the included studies investigated only one or two variables. for example, three studies investigated temperature, precipitation, and dengue incidence. two studies considered the relationship between subterranean aquatic habitats and Ae. aegypti productivity. if the study satisfied 80\u2013100% of applicable Fink criteria, it received a quality score of 5, satisfying between 60 and 79% resulting in a score of 4, those between 40 and 59% received a score of 3, those between 20 and 39% received a score of 2, and those between 0 and 19% received a score of 1. a score of 1-2 was considered fair; scores between 3 and 4 were deemed moderate; and a score of 5 was considered strong. the following exclusion criteria were used: (1) studies that provided no analysis or description of political, social, and economic conditions, ecology or climate. (2) studies that considered intrinsic factors pertaining to the virus and the host; (3) articles that addressed west Nile Virus (WNV), yellow fever, or other vector-borne viruses in the Caribbean or Latin America. studies were evaluated and rated based on the following criteria adapted from Fink 2010 [48]. each question was answered Yes, No, or Not Applicable (NA) a yes answer received 1 point, a No answer received zero points, and criteria that were not Applicable were disregarded. ten studies (38.5%) satisfied 80% or more of the applicable criteria (range 80%\u201393%), achieving a score of five and a \u201chigh\u201d rating. all studies analyzed satisfied at least 33% of the relevant Fink criteria, achieving a score of two or more. studies on climate six examined the association between temperature, precipitation, and dengue incidence [22, 25, 48\u201351]. the effect of temperature on dengue incidence was highest in Puerto Rico's cool and wet mountainous area. he found a weak association between year-to-year variability in dengue cases and local rainfall and an index of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). he also found a weak association between short-term interannual variations in temperature and dengue incidence. study examined effects of landscape elements on distribution of containers with Ae. aegypti and Ae. mediovittatus in urban, suburban, and rural areas. study found that in rural communities Ae. aegypti do not disperse far from their development sites and tend to be spatially clustered at the household level. more Ae. aegypti than surface containers (8-9 pupae/person versus 1.3\u20132.0 pupae/person on average) it is important to note that this study was the first study of aquatic habitats producing dengue vectors anywhere in the Caribbean region or in Central and South America. sequential sampling provided substantial reductions in the sample size required to determine if vector density falls above or below a given threshold. he found that after sampling only 25 premises in the first survey and 125 in the second survey, it was possible to determine that pupae densities were above the dengue epidemic threshold (female pupae/person of 0.19). Ramos et al. 2009 Child-focused intervention programs Pilot child-focused community program Limited results: did not impact larvae indices Winch et al. 2002; Clark et al. 2004 Community intervention programs Community-based, health education campaign Assessed barriers to prevention. both authors stressed the importance of virologic surveillance in confirming the accuracy of dengue diagnosis. one article addressed the effect of human population growth on epidemic dengue [15] one article addressed the effect of human population growth on epidemic dengue. the author identified several barriers to sustained dengue prevention. he identified misconceptions about dengue from outdated educational material. he also identified differences in KAP by gender, which were consistent with cultural values. cox investigated the effect of temperature across an urban to rural environmental and an elevation gradient. he ascertained that Ae. aegypti was positively associated with water temperature. three studies explored the interaction effects of climate (temperature and precipitation) and household level and human-related behavior on vector abundance and productivity. the results of this review are presented in the study framework (Figure 3) adapted from Caprara et al. (2009) and illustrates the interrelationships between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural determinants affecting dengue transmission in Puerto Rico. 4.1. Part 1: Quality Assessment Article quality was assessed to describe the research. studies on climate six examined the association between temperature, precipitation, and dengue transmission [22, 25, 48\u201351]. dengue transmission increased by a factor of 3.4 for each 1\u00b0C increase in sea surface temperature. in contrast, jury (2008) found that monthly increases in dengue cases were driven by rainfall (May to November) while intra-annual variability in dengue cases related positively to temperature. studies on ecological factors discussed effects of ecological factors on vector breeding and/or pupal production. the number of pupae in yard containers showed a positive and significant association with the number of trees per household, water volume, and lower water temperature. three studies examined the relationship between subterranean aquatic habitats, septic tanks (ST), and Ae. aegypti productivity. septic tanks produce significantly more Ae. aegypti than surface containers (8-9 pupae/person versus 1.3\u20132.0 pupae/person on average). studies on environmental factors Thirteen studies examined the effect of environmental factors on dengue emergence and disease severity. three considered entomologic surveillance and dengue vector control measures [58\u201360] dictive computer models for validating dengue threshold; mosquito simulation model (CIMSiM), and dengue simulation model (DENSiM) Sequential sampling programs (SSP) efficient method Barrera 2009 Larval control programs Cost-effective in conjunction with early warning systems. two studies evaluated the island's enhanced dengue surveillance system. she found that simplified case definitions for DHF based on WHO criteria might be useful for clinic-based surveillance. both Rigau-P\u00e9rez and Ramos stressed importance of virologic surveillance. two articles explored knowledge, attitudes, and practices about dengue prevention in Puerto Rico's communities. authors found misconceptions about dengue from outdated educational material. authors also identified differences in KAP by gender. the effect of temperature on dengue incidence was highest in the cool and wet mountainous area. the effect of precipitation was greatest in the hot and dry coastal region. in contrast, Jury (2008) found that monthly increases in dengue cases were driven by rainfall (May to November) while intra-annual variability in dengue cases related positively to temperature. the association between weather variables and dengue incidence was stronger in areas with a higher poverty index [25]. Keating (2001) found factors other than climate might be contributing to seasonal dengue incidence in Puerto Rico, such as predator-prey relationships. study examined the effects of housing distribution and patterns on Ae. aegypti dispersal in rural communities. three studies examined the relationship between subterranean aquatic habitats, septic tanks (ST), and Ae. aegypti productivity. study: larval development in the nutrient-rich environment of septic tanks may provide a fitness advantage to adult Ae. aegypti. more accurate, population-based estimate of dengue incidence and severity. EDSS allowed for a more accurate, population-based estimate of dengue incidence and severity. two studies evaluated the island's laboratory-based, enhanced dengue surveillance system (EDSS), which was developed by the CDC and first implemented in Puerto Rico in 2005. both Rigau-P\u00e9rez and Ramos stressed the importance of virologic surveillance in confirming the accuracy of dengue diagnosis [64, 66] two articles explored knowledge, attitudes, and practices about dengue prevention in Puerto Rico's communities. authors identified barriers to sustained dengue prevention. authors also identified differences in KAP by gender. the effect of precipitation was greatest in the hot and dry coastal region. he found that the association between weather variables and dengue incidence was stronger in areas with a higher poverty index. he also inferred that factors other than climate related to the history of herd immunity are also influencing the transmission of dengue fever. in warmer years, containers filled with water by humans were the most important habitat for mosquitoes. in warmer years there was an increase in dengue cases that peaked following high rainfall. several studies provided insights in Ae. aegypti habitat and potential for dengue risk in Puerto Rico. septic tanks produced significantly more Ae. aegypti than surface containers throughout the year. septic tanks produced significantly more Ae. aegypti than surface containers throughout the year. health communication campaigns are often poorly resourced, rarely engage health communication experts from the affected area, and seldom benefit from meaningful evaluation. despite this, community-based interventions remain to be critical to achieve long-term vector control through behavior change [61, 65] the inclusion of early warning data into larval control programs may also be beneficial, apart from the positive health effect, as it can improve cost-effectiveness of larval control programs. there are several limitations in this literature review. ka, transmission can change only if the vector can be controlled. but extrinsic factors are likely to remain influential well into the future. the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper."}
