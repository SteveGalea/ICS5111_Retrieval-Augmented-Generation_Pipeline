AKAP7 central domain (PDB code 2VFK; Z = 12.5) and the 2\u2032-5\u2032 RNA ligase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB code 1IUH; Z = 12.4) as the closest structural homologs of the RVA VP3 CTD. AKAP7 (tan; PDB 2VFK) is shown alone (A) or superimposed on the RVA VP3 CTD (cyan) residues 706 to 717 and 803 to 816 are shown in dark blue. the corresponding AKAP7 residues, 100 to 131 and 230 to 261, form helices and strands. blue highlighting indicates identical amino acids in the alignment. a VP3 CTD, R792, undergo a significant conformational change upon binding to 2-5A. other residues of the RVA VP3 CTD R loop, M793 and F794, shifted 3.2 and 4.14 respectively. however, the RVA VP3 CTD introduces significant conformational changes upon substrate binding. the RVA VP3 CTD cleaved 2-5A with similar kinetics and efficiency to MHV ns2. as expected, H(S/T) mutants H718A and H797A were inactive. however, the substitution was the more detrimental of the two changes. the VP3 CTDs of RVB and RVG exhibit only 17.2% and 19.1% sequence identity with the CTD of RVA. homology models show very similar disposition of the catalytic H(S/T) motifs (and HN for RVG) homology models of the RVB VP3 CTD (B; orange) and the RVG VP3 CTD (C; pink) with histidine and threonine residues from the H(S/T) motifs shown in ball-and-stick representation and labeled. arrows indicate major structural differences. aligned sequences from RVA and RVB VP3 CTDs, coronavirus putative nsp9 proteins, coronavirus ns2 proteins, and AKAP7 proteins. the most highly conserved amino acids mapped to (i) the first half of the 1-strand and the loop that precedes it. only five amino acids were identical for all sequences in the alignment. AKAP7 and RRV were aligned using the T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment server. colored columns indicate amino acid identity, with dark blue representing the highest identity. a region of the alignment representing the C termini of the proteins has been omitted. the VP3 CTD structure exhibits an /-fold with three -helices (1 to 3) and seven -strands (1 to 7), which form an antiparallel, concave, twisted -sheet. this finding is consistent with a recently reported structure for the VP3 CTD of another simian RVA (strain SA11) (34) two-dimensional topology diagrams of a consensus 2H phosphoesterase domain (A), the AKAP7 central domain (B), and the RVA VP3 CTD (C) and predicted topology of the RVB and RVG VP3 CTDs (D) the 5\u2032 monophosphate of the 5\u2032 adenosine in 2-5A interacts with the residues T720, H797, and T799 of the H(S/T) motifs via hydrophobic interactions. residues L758, I762, and I795 form hydrophobic interactions with the adenine base of the substrate. the side chain of R792 also forms a hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032 phosphate, suggesting that this moiety is important for positioning the RVA VP3 CTD is oriented as in Fig. 2A, with side chains of interacting amino acids shown as sticks and labeled. the hydrogen bond and the cation- interactions are indicated as black dashed lines and red dashed lines with double arrows. AKAP7 is shown alone (A) or superimposed on the RVA VP3 CTD (cyan) (B) two loops of the RVA VP3 CTD, residues 706 to 717 and 803 to 816, are shown in dark blue. the corresponding AKAP7 residues, 100 to 131 and 230 to 261, which form helices and strands, are shown in orange. the secondary structure of the RVA VP3 CTD is shown in light blue below the sequences. AKAP7 residues interacting with 2-5A (yellow ball-and-stick representation) are labeled. AKAP7 residues interacting with AMP are labeled. the RVA VP3 CTD cleaved 2-5A with similar kinetics and efficiency to MHV ns2. the RVA VP3 CTD cleaved 2-5A with similar kinetics and efficiency. both L758A and L758F substitutions significantly diminished RVA VP3 CTD 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity. the mutant exhibited activity indistinguishable from that of MBP following any length of incubation with 2-5A. homology models show a very similar disposition of the catalytic H(S/T) motifs. however, there are noticeable differences in comparison to the RVA VP3 CTD. loop between the 1- and 2-strands is nine amino acids shorter. ructural superimposition of RVA VP3 CTD structure (cyan) with RVB (orange) and RVG (pink) VP3 CTD models. catalytic motif requirements for 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity. threonine in second H(S/T) motif replaced with asparagine or arginine. aligned proteins onto the structure of the RVA VP3 CTD/2-5A complex. the most highly conserved amino acids mapped to (i) the first half of the 1-strand and the loop that precedes it, (ii) the 2- and 5-strands, which each contain an H(S/T) motif, and (iii) the loop preceding the 5-strand. 2H phosphoesterases are found in eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and DNA and RNA viruses and mediate a variety of functions via cleavage of nucleoside-containing substrates. a region representing the C termini of the proteins, in which no identical or similar residues were observed, has been omitted. avirus, and torovirus 2H 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE domains, AKAP7 or a related cellular 2H phosphoesterase are thought to have been acquired by these RNA viruses through recombination (15, 18) the high-resolution structure of the RVA VP3 CTD and its efficient enzymatic activity suggest a new minimal core topology for 2H phosphoesterases. motifs and the predominantly electropositive potential of the groove formed by the -sheet in the RVA VP3 CTD identify it as the substrate-binding cleft. lack of activity observed for the RVA VP3 CTD H718A and H797A mutants is consistent with an essential role for these residues in catalysis. phenylalanine in AKAP7 is replaced by leucine in the RVA VP3 CTD. steric stacking or hydrophobic stabilization by leucine appears to be sufficient for comparable cleavage activity. MHV A59 ns2 and the strain WA VP3 CTD previously have activity similar to that of AKAP7. R792 interactions may be critical for RVA VP3 CTD 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity. cation- interaction contributes to substrate stabilization for 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs. the 2\u2032 adenosine moiety of the 2-5A substrate is critical. no specific recognition of the substrate's 2\u2032-5\u2032 linkage. however, the triggering of R-loop movement by the 2\u2032 phosphate moiety of 2-5A may explain the preference for a 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked substrate. the conserved residues adjacent to those involved in catalysis may aid in substrate recognition by providing steric boundaries in the binding cleft. idophosphinato)adenine (PDB 2YOZ) and the E. coli 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic PDE ThpR with AMP have been published (20, 40, 41) each of the 2\u2032,3\u2032-PDEs interacts with substrate through H(S/T) histidine and threonine residues and a - stacking interaction between the adenine base and a phenylalanine three amino acids 2\u2032,3\u2032-Cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-PDE residues that interact with the substrate are shown and labeled in pink. it is unclear why the RVG VP3 CTD fails to cleave 2-5A efficiently in comparison to the RVA VP3 CTDs. it is unclear why the RVG VP3 CTD fails to cleave 2-5A efficiently. the 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE domain exists at the C terminus of VP3 in divergent rotavirus species. RVH viruses encode an 8-kDa dsRNA-binding protein that inhibits PKR activation."}
