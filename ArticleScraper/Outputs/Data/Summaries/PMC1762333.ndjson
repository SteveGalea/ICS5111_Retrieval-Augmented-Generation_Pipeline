{"summary": "rapid learning affects the final outbreak size even when learning exhibits diminishing returns (relaxation) the expected outbreak size for societal learning twice as effective was 116 cases. societal learning can greatly affect the final size of disease outbreaks. this learning process has not been considered in theories of outbreak control [5], [6] or in near real-time models of emerging infections [7], [8]. a partial list of the processes contributing to societal learning includes isolation and identification of the infectious agent, development of tests for clinical diagnosis, disseminating information to public health and medical personnel. the first analytical treatment of the concept of societal learning during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Singapore. we introduce statistical models to distinguish between relaxing and non-relaxing learning. in such a case, the rate of societal learning is said to relax. we represent the average removal rate of individual cases as a function of time since the outbreak began, marked by the time at which the index case became infectious. we assume that direct transmission between infected persons is the primary source of infection and that development of immunity and removing infectious individuals have negligible impact on the susceptible population. the second component is an effect of societal learning and is assumed to be additive to the base removal rate. we represent the total removal rate as function of time (t) = a(t)+b where b is the base removal rate and a(t) is a function for the additional effect of societal learning. a(t) = a 0 ta1, with a 11. Where a 1 = 1 this model is equivalent to the linear model discussed above. such a case is unlikely, however, and would imply acceleration not only in removals, but in the removal rate. plots on the right are for = [0.0066, 1, 0.12] (black), = [0.0086, 1, 0.12] (blue), = [0.0106, 1, 0.12] (red). x-axis can be interpreted in units of days in which case the black points on the left side coincide with the parameter estimates reported in Table 1. we used the mean number of days between the onset of clinical symptoms and removal, by week, to fit different models for the removal process. we used the mean number of days between the onset of symptoms and removal, by week, to fit different models for the removal process. we assume that each state variable X and Y can take only integer values. this model is a pair of coupled birth-death chains. we assume that individual transitions between classes are Markovian. to obtain a central (\u201cbest\u201d) estimate of 0 we take the midpoint of the range [2.2, 3.6] = 2.9 and multiply by the point estimate of our regression 0 = 0.12 to obtain = 0.35. the transition rate between latent and infectious individuals is approximately equal to the reciprocal of the duration of the incubation period. an alternative is to compare the observed outbreak size with the theoretical distribution of outbreak sizes for outbreaks initialized at I 0 = 1 conditioned on a \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018observable\u2019 outbreak occurring. however, this simply pushes back the problem of specifying the initial condition as some number of cases must be specified to correspond with \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018observable\u2019. simulated 10,000 iterations of the stochastic S-E-I-R model described above using Gillespie's direct method [28] with double and half the estimated basic learning rate. all other parameters were set to their best estimates and with initial condition I 0 = 8. we expect that as information about clinical symptoms is collected and disseminated, the average time between the onset of symptoms and individual self-removal will decline. the expected final epidemic size for this model is [18]: where and I 0 is the initial number of infected individuals. the distribution function for the duration of the outbreak with I 0 = 1 is: This is a very general model, as we have only specified that the transmission rate 0 is constant and that the rate of removal (t) changes over time. the model with linear removal rate implies that the average time between infection and removal over time follows a hyperbola, g(t) = ( 1(t))1 = (a 0 t+b)1, and there is no upper bound to the rate at which infected individuals can be isolated. effective, we suppose that the average time between infection and removal can be brought arbitrarily close to 0. for most (perhaps all) diseases this is an unreasonable assumption in the long run. a rumor suggests that the fraction of the population which remains uninformed declines roughly logistically. the fraction of the population which remains uninformed declines roughly proportional to the number of people who are in possession of the rumor but declining constantly over time. the concept of the reproductive ratio (designated by R 0 at the beginning of the outbreak, Rt thereafter) is deterministic and is given by Rt = 0/(t) for the case (t) = 1(t), the time to control is given by Tc = ( 0b)/a 0.Still more models could be considered. hypothesis of no societal learning at all is given by a 1 = 1 for a 0 = 0. Simulation To represent the full epidemic process for SARS, we adopt the familiar S-E-I-R modeling framework (Figure 2A in [5]. by substituting 0 = S and ignoring the dynamics of removed individuals, we obtain the two-compartment model in Figure 2B. lipsitch et al. [15] determined that the basic reproductive ratio (R 0) for this outbreak was in the range [2.2, 3.6]. these values accord well with the likelihood-based estimate of Wallinga and Teunis [23], who report a point estimate of R 0 = 3.1 and 95% confidence interval [2.3, 4.0]. the estimated period of approximately 6.7. days is roughly consistent with, e.g., the ranges of estimates compiled by the world health organization (Table 1 in [24]) and the estimate (6.37 d) and 95% confidence interval [5.29, 7.75] reported by Donnelly et al. [25] but slightly larger than the estimate of 4.8 d (95% confidence interval: [4.37, 5.29] obtained by Donnelly et al. [26]. we simulated two distributions of final outbreak sizes. first we initialized at I 0 = 3, which is the midpoint of the estimated interval for R 0 identified by Lipsitch et al. [15], I 2 = R 0 = 2.9, rounded to the nearest integer, corresponding to second generation initialization. second, we initialized at I 0 = 8, which is the rounded value of the expected number of infected individuals. we obtained the average epidemic size from eqn (5) for combinations of a 0 and a 1 in the ranges and a 0[0.44,1]. these ranges illustrate the range of cases between extremes in which societal learning is slow and relaxation is rapid (practically no effect of societal learning) and where societal learning is fast and no relaxation occurs at all (similar to the outbreak of SARS). we obtained an estimate of 8.3 d (95% confidence interval: [5.8, 14.3], obtained by inverting the confidence limits reported in Table 2). average daily removal rate of infectious individuals increased consistently for eight weeks following the initial outbreak of SARS in 2003. the full model in unable to estimate a 0 and b with high precision. but in the model fit to all the data finding that a 1 is negligibly different than 1 justifies removing this parameter from the model. the observation in week 8 may be of exceptional importance to the final model. the average outbreak size decreased with the duration of the latent period. we simulated 500 iterations of the model at each of 13 different durations. the average outbreak size decreased with the duration of the latent period. we obtained the average epidemic size from eqn (5) for combinations of a 0 and a 1 in the ranges and a 0[0.44,1]. the effect of relaxation can be examined by comparing the average outbreak size at various values of a 11 with the value at a 1 = 1, where there is no relaxation. we obtained an estimate of 8.3 d (95% confidence interval: [5.8, 14.3], obtained by inverting the confidence limits reported in Table 2). Figure 4. Average daily removal rate of infectious individuals increased consistently for eight weeks following the initial outbreak of SARS in 2003. model selection is based on AIC, with the lowest AIC being most parsimonious. a 1 is negligibly different than 1 justifies removing this parameter from the model (resulting in the reduced model), permitting much more precise estimation of the remaining parameters. simulated 500 iterations of the model at each of 13 different durations for the average latent period. the average outbreak size decreased with the duration of the latent period. if we exclude this point from analysis post hoc, we find that we are unable to make any strong conclusions at all. if we exclude this point from analysis post hoc, we find that we are unable to make any strong conclusions at all. we first explicitly considered societal learning parametrically in a theoretical model. we showed that the final outbreak size decreases rapidly with a modest investment in learning. we also found strong evidence of learning in data from the 2003 outbreak of SARS. societal and economic costs of mistakenly declaring a state of emergency can be tremendous, but are probably small in comparison to the costs of failing to intervene in a major preventable outbreak. a cost sensitive model should be developed to balance the competing goals of raising unnecessary alarm and preventing a major outbreak. a good understanding of the dynamical consequences of public health response would enable real-time modeling to focus on estimating disease parameters like transmission rates. estimated disease components and known or conjectured models for response, including models of societal learning, could be integrated in a single modeling framework."}
