{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia. the virus is transmitted in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and swine. HV induces an ATM-damage response that is essential for viral replication. inhibition of CHK2 kinase activity significantly reduces the CPE and genome replication of HSV-1 in corneal epithelium. cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM L-glutamine. HEK293T, a human embryonic kidney cells, were cultured in 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco) surviving cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting 1,260 human kinases and phosphatases. genomes from surviving cells were extracted by using the QIAamp DNA Mini and Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) gene regions containing shRNAs were amplified by PCR with primers (5\u2032-TAATTTCTTGGGTAGTTTGCAGTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCCCAATCCCCTTT-3\u2032) primary antibodies used in this study included anti-CHK2 (sc5278, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; H00011200-M01, Abnova), anti-CHK2 (Thr68) and anti-actin (Chemicon) cDNA was reverse transcribed from 2 g RNA with a random hexamer and a ThermoScript RT Kit (Invitrogen) cell lines and reagents U87 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM L-glutamine. HEK293T, a human embryonic kidney cells, were cultured in 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco) medium. d lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting 1,260 human kinases and phosphatases were lysed and subjected to western blot analysis. gene regions containing shRNAs were amplified by PCR with primers (5\u2032-TAATTTCTTGGGTAGTTTGCAGTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCCCAATCCTTT-3\u2032) primary antibodies used in this study included anti-CHK2 (sc5278, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; H00011200-M01, Abnova), anti-CHK2 (Thr68) and anti-actin (Chemicon). cDNA was reverse transcribed from 2 g RNA with a random hexamer and a ThermoScript RT Kit (Invitrogen) kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening identified CHK2 as a cellular factor involved in JEV infection. each kinases/phosphatases pooled tube contains 180 kinases/phosphatases genes. each gene is targeted by 5 shRNAs that bind to distinct target sequences. e were selected with puromycin (10 g/ml) for 4 days and infected with JEV at an MOI of 10. knockdown of one candidate gene, CHEK2, substantially rendered cell survival from JEV infection. human A549 cells were transduced with shCHK2-expressing lentivirus and selected by puromycin. RNA and protein levels of CHK2 were verified by RT-PCR with CHK2-specific primers. immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates at 24 h with antibodies against T68-phosphorylated CHK2, CHK2 and actin. u87 cells were infected with JEV (MOI 0.1 and 5) in absence of non-cytotoxic CHK2 inhibitor II. the virus progeny in both high MOI (Figure 7B) and low MOI (Figure 7C) was suppressed by 50 M CHK2 inhibitor II. blocking the ATM/CHK2 pathway by an ATM inhibitor or a CHK2 inhibitor reduced JEV replication in human glioblastoma, lung cancer carcinoma, and neuroblastoma cell lines. culture supernatants were collected for virus titration by plaque-forming assays. be(2)C cells were infected with JEV at MOI 0.1, 1 or 5 in the absence of 25 or 50 M CHK2 inhibitor II as indicated. JEV infection increased the proportion of cells in the G1 phase from 55.46% to 78.87% in U87 cells. kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening identified CHK2. lentivirus sets knocked down 1260 genes encoding kinase/phosphatases. each gene is targeted by 5 shRNAs that bind to distinct target sequences. lentivirus sets accounts for 90% of all kinase/phosphatase in accordance with NCBI database. kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening identified CHK2 as a cellular factor involved in JEV infection. human cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing shRNA targeting CHK2 (shCHK2) or LacZ control (shLacZ) culture supernatants were collected for virus titration. data are mean SD virus titers (n = 3). EV replication was further assessed by using a cell-permeable CHK2 inhibitor. U87 cells were infected with JEV (MOI 0.1 and 5) in the absence or presence of non-cytotoxic CHK2 inhibitor II (25 and 50 M) U87 cells were infected with JEV (MOI 0, 0.1 and 5) with or without of CHK2 inhibitor II (0, 25 and 50 M) at 24 h post treatment, immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates at 24 h with antibodies against, T68-phosphorylated CHK2, CHK2 and actin was performed. culture supernatants were collected for virus titration by plaque-forming assays. data are mean SD virus titers (n = 3). RNAi-based technology has been extensively used to identify genes involved in cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle, cancer biology and host\u2013pathogen interactions. RNAi-based technology has been extensively used to identify genes involved in cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle, cancer biology and host\u2013pathogen interactions. the replication of subgenomic replicon RNA of HCV was suppressed in cells with CHK2 knockdown. this study also found that downregulation of CHK2 and inhibition of CHK activity enhanced cell resistance to JEV infection. viruses may hijack CHK2 to elongate the cell cycle arrest. the exact mechanism of how JEV induces the DNA damage response is not fully understood. the kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening system can be an effective strategy to search for cellular factors involved in regulation of JEV infection."}
