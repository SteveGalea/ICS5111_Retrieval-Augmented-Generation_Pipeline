{"summary": "the current method of DNA purification from pools of vector black flies relies upon silica adsorption. the oligonucleotide capture assay was shown to reliably detect one O. volvulus infective larva in pools containing 200 African or Latin American flies. this is a two-four fold improvement over the conventional assay. the international community is currently supporting several programs whose goals are either to eliminate the disease as a public health problem, or to locally eliminate the causative agent of the disease, Onchocerca volvulus. current guidelines require that the prevalence of infective flies carrying infective larvae (L3) be less than 1/2000 in every sentinel community for transmission to be interrupted. algorithms have been developed that permit one to derive a point estimate of the prevalence of infection in the fly population. separate pools of heads and bodies may be screened to obtain estimates of the prevalence of infective flies (flies with infective stages in their head) and the prevalence of infected flies (flies with immature larval stages in their bodies) this approach has been used to monitor transmission of O. volvulus in many foci of Latin America and africa [8 magnetic bead based purification protocols have been developed for many different pathogens. most involve direct capture of the pathogen using beads coated with pathogen-specific antibodies. oligonucleotides have been used to magnetically purify pathogen genomic DNA. the flies were kept at 25\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity to allow the microfilariae to develop into L3. the larvae were frozen in 9% DMSO, 4 mM PVP, 10% FCS in Grace medium using Bio-Coll. a single O. volvulus L3 was added to each pool. the beads were isolated by placing the tubes in a six tube magnetic separator. the supernatants were removed and discarded, and 600 l of MB3 wash buffer was added to each sample. the beads were exposed to air for one minute to permit the traces of ethanol to evaporate. a total of 5 l of a 0.5 M solution of a 0.5 M solution of OVS2-biotin primer (5\u2032B-AATCTCAAAACGGGTACATA-3\u2032, where B = biotin) was added to each sample. the samples were then heated to 95\u00b0C for three minutes. the beads were then washed five times with 200 l binding buffer. total volume of 50 L containing 0.5 mol/L of O-150 primer (5\u2032-GATTYTTCCGRCGAANARCGC-3\u2032) and 0.5 mol/L of biotinylated O-150 primer (5\u2032-B-GCNRTRTAAATNTGNAAATTC- 3\u2032) Reaction mixtures also contained 60 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 9.0), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgCl black flies and O. volvulus infective larvae were collected in public areas of the community of Jos\u00e9 Mara Morelos y Pav\u00f3n, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico between the hours of 0700 and 1000. the majority of flies captured during this period were nulliparous, and the risk of infection was therefore minimal. the parasite material was prepared in the tropical medicine research station, Kumba, cameroon, and is being stored at the New York Blood Center. a single O. volvulus L3 was added to each pool. the pools were homogenized in 200 l of T1 buffer, 25 l of proteinase K solution was added. DNA was eluted from the beads by the addition of 100 l of elution buffer. the beads were shaken for 5 minutes to allow the traces of ethanol to evaporate. the supernatant containing the purified DNA was then transferred to a fresh tube. the beads were resuspended in 150 l of binding buffer by pipetting. the beads were then resuspended in 20 l of sterile water, heated to 80\u00b0C for 2 minutes. the supernatant containing the purified DNA transferred to a new tube. cycling conditions consisted of five cycles of one minute at 94\u00b0C, two minutes at 37\u00b0C, and 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C. the reaction was completed by incubating at 72\u00b0C for six minutes. PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was essentially as previously described. pools containing varying numbers of heads of bodies were spiked with a single O. volvulus L3 and DNA prepared from the pools using either the conventional method of organic extractions followed by adsorption to a silica matrix. oligonucleotide capture of O. volvulus genomic DNA followed by magnetic purification of the captured oligonucleotide-DNA complexes. 100 Bodies 100% (3/3) 0.116 (0.104\u20130.127) 100% (3/3) 0.192 (0.190\u20130.193) 150 Bodies 100% (3/3) 0.120 (0.104\u20130.149) 100% (3/3) 0.261 (0.260\u20130.262) 200 Bodies 0% (0/3) 0.071 (0.062\u20130.081) 100% (3/3) 0.231 (0.230\u20130.232) spiking experiments were repeated using pools containing 200 flies. all spiked pools were found to be positive, suggesting that the capture assay preformed equally well on both African and Latin American vectors of onchocerciasis. the oligonucleotide capture method of purifying O. volvulus DNA is superior to the conventional silica adsorption method. the oligonucleotide capture assay appears to result in DNA preparations that are freer of PCR inhibitors than are those prepared using silica adsorption. this increase in pool size results in a dramatic cost savings in the per-unit cost of the pool screen assay. the oligonucleotide assay is relatively inexpensive, costing less than $579. this would be recovered in reagent costs alone after screening just 114 pools of flies. the standard O-150 PCR will amplify sequences present in all Onchocerca species, including Onchocerca ochengi."}
