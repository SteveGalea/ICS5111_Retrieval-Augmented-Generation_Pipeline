{"summary": "male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; initial weight, 150 to 175 g; initial weight, 150 to 175 g; Crl:SD, Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI) were pair-housed in autoclaved polysulfone individually ventilated microisolation cages (39.3 cm 28.5 cm 19.4 cm; Allentown Caging, Allentown, NJ) rats were anesthetized by placing them into an induction box and delivering isoflurane (5%) and oxygen by a precision vaporizer. rats were then removed from the box and placed on a warm-water blanket to maintain body temperature. a rat is placed in the test box with access to a reward bottle filled with diluted condensed milk solution. the rat must make facial contact with 2 parallel vertical metal thermodes which can be adjusted to contact the same shaved area of the face each test session. a total of 5 training sessions (no capsaicin, thermode temperature set at 37 \u00b0C) were necessary for consistent completion of the task. each test session was alternated with a training session, with a washout period of at least 4 d. each rat was offered a plastic syringe cap filled with 2 mL of nut paste. rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 drug groups. oral doses were randomly assigned prior to the first test session. both treatment groups were then tested by using buprenorphine HCl. test day Rat ID Sex 1 2 3 4 5 11 M 20 30 40 0 10 12 M 40 0 10 20 30 13 M 10 20 30 40 0 14 M 40 0 10 20 30 15 M 30 40 0 10 20 20 16 M 0 10 20 30 40 17 M 20 30 40 0 10 18 M 0 10 20 30 40 19 M 30 40 0 10 20 20 20 M 10 20 30 40 0 31 F 40 0 10 20 30 40 34 F 0 10 20 30 40 35 F 40 rats were allowed to acclimate to the room for 30 min after ingesting the assigned drug-nut paste mixture. a bland ophthalmic ointment was placed liberally on both eyes to prevent corneal dryness. a total anesthesia time for each rat was 10 min. a 2-tailed paired t test was used to compare the LFR of each dose with a statistically significant effect to the LFR obtained from a dose of 0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine given SC (positive analgesic control) all data are presented as the mean SEM. female rats were acquired after completion of the study using the male rats. all rats were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by thoracotomy. the research protocol was approved by the university of Florida animal care and use committee. the OPAD (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) used in this study is described elsewhere. the test box consisted of acrylic walls (20.3 cm 20.3 cm 16.2 cm) with an opening (4 cm 6 cm) in one wall. a standard rodent water bottle containing the reward solution of a sweetened condensed milk solution was mounted outside the box. a total of 5 training sessions (no capsaicin, thermode temperature set at 37 \u00b0C) were necessary for consistent completion of the task. each rat was offered a plastic syringe cap filled with 2 mL of nut paste in its home cage. nut paste was immediately offered in a 1-mL syringe through the wire bar lid of the cage. two rats can be effectively medicated simultaneously with analgesics mixed in a palatable vehicle. voluntary ingestion decreases handling stress and provides assurance that animals obtain adequate doses for effective analgesia. at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg PO and buprenorphine at 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mg/kg PO. all rats were tested as described after receiving 0.03 mg/kg SC buprenorphine 30 min prior to operant testing. test day Rat ID Sex 1 2 3 4 5 1 M 0.5 0.6 0 0.3 0.4 2 M 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.3 3 M 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 4 0.5 0.6 24 F 0.6 0 0.3 0.4 0.5 25 F 0 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 27 F 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.3 0.4 29 F 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.3 0.4 29 F 0.6 0 0.3 0.4 0.5 30 F 0.5 0.6 0. a bland ophthalmic ointment was placed liberally on both eyes. data for each drug and sex were analyzed separately by using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA for the dose variable. a 2-tailed paired t test was used to compare the LFR of each dose with a statistically significant effect to the LFR obtained from a dose of 0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine given SC. the LFR did not differ between buprenorphine at 0.03 mg/kg SC and tramadol at 20 mg/kg (t = 0.7139, P = 0.4934), 30 mg/kg (t = 0.6291, P = 0.5449) and 40 mg/kg (t = 0.01830, P = 0.9858). both the 0.5- and 0.6-mg/kg dose produced greater analgesic responses than did the no-dose treatment. comparison of the LFR after VI of tramadol by male rats revealed a significant main effect among all groups. VI of tramadol provided a mean increase in LFR of 48%, 101%, 94%, and 105% for 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mg/kg respectively. none of these differences was significant. the LFR did not differ between buprenorphine at 0.03 mg/kg SC and tramadol at 20 mg/kg (t = 0.7139, P = 0.4934), 30 mg/kg (t = 0.6291, P = 0.4934), or 40 mg/kg (t = 0.01830, P = 0.9858). both the 0.5- and 0.6-mg/kg dose produced greater (P 0.05 in both comparisons) analgesic responses than did the a model system capable of assessing clinical analgesic efficacy has slowed the pace with which these data are published. in the current study, an innovative orofacial pain assay was used to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of 2 commonly available analgesics, tramadol and buprenorphine. acy after oral administration was less than 60 min or that the plasma tramadol concentration was too low after first-pass hepatic metabolism to produce analgesic effect. male rats given an oral dose of 40 mg/kg and tested at 60 min after administration showed significant increases in LFR. this finding suggests that 40 mg/kg VI tramadol is as effective in producing analgesic effect at 60 min after administration. sex-associated difference may be explained, at least in part, by the hepatic metabolism of tramadol. in rats, tramadol is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D1 to its only pharmacologically active metabolite, O-demethyltramadol. oral buprenorphine doses of 0.5 and 0.6 mg/kg significantly increased the LFR in male rats at 60 min after ingestion. female rats did not achieve a significant increase in LFR at the doses tested. this lack of a significant effect of oral buprenorphine in female rats might be attributed to several factors. studies have evaluated the effect of buprenorphine\u2013nut paste mixtures on corticosterone levels and clinical parameters. male rats receiving a single dose of buprenorphine (0.4 mg/kg) mixed with nut paste had significantly lower plasma corticosterone levels for 18 h after jugular vein catheterization than did rats given buprenorphine subcutaneously. paired rats trained to ingest the drug-nut paste mixture from a syringe. nut paste alone and the drug\u2013nut paste mixtures were easily aspirated into a 1-mL syringe. only one male rat initially failed to consume the entire amount during the first exposure. one study in humans found that tramadol administered orally after a high-fat meal did not increase the maximum concentration or AUC compared with those in fasted volunteers. this effect occurred only after continuous access to sucrose solutions for 2 to 3 wk. l administered at 30 mg/kg has a time at maximum concentration of 0.7 0.3 and 0.5 h, and a t1/2 of 3.0 1.5 and 3.9 0.6 h, for male and female rats respectively. however, the pharmacokinetics of oral tramadol metabolites were not reported. sing of tramadol in rats may lead to saturation of first-pass metabolism and increased bioavailability. also increased analgesic efficacy at lower doses."}
