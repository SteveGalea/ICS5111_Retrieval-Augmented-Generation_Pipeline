{"summary": "most animal epithelia are covered in their apical surface by a carbohydrate-rich meshwork of various complexity and thickness, the glycocalyx. these structures constitute successive protective surfaces where viruses aggregate and either access to attachment factors and receptors at the surface of the epithelial cells. this dual fate depends on the virus affinity for glycans, which must allow to escape the trap of the mucus. densoviruses can be highly pathogenic, a feature that can represent threats for insect mass rearing or opportunities for biocontrol against harmful insects as alternative to chemicals. a deep understanding of the mechanisms driving host range and pathogenesis requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms driving host range and pathogenesis. large entomopathogenic viruses have developed specific mechanisms to pass through extracellular matrices. entomopathogenic viruses have developed specific mechanisms to pass through extracellular matrices including virus-encoded enzymes and specific proteins associated with viral particles of baculo-and entomopoxviruses. we found that capsids affinity for the PM might result from multiple interactions with different glycans including chitin and glycosylated proteins. we showed that early infection results in (i) an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) secretion by epithelial cells associated with a disorganization of the PM structure. lectins Calcofluor white M2R (Calcofluor; F3543), N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc; A4106), N-Acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc; A2795), D-(+)-Fucose (Fucose; F8150), D-(+)-Mannose (Mannose; M6020), Mucin from erythrocytes cells were diluted at 3% (v/v) with 150 mM NaCl and treated with 0.5 mg/mL of trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. positive controls of hemagglutination were performed using 25 L of WGA (1 mg/mL) PMs were isolated and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) with JcDV (109 veg/L; 500L), or with JcDV pre-incubated for 1 h with glycans (GlcNAc, GalNAc, Fucose or Mannose; 5 M to 5 mM) before infection. the PMs were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA. semi-thin sections (1 m) were cut in the central part of the caterpillars corresponding to the midgut. each independent experiment was repeated at least three times. each experiment was repeated at least three times. two L (5% of the pull down and 1% of the initial input) was loaded on 4\u201315% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel (Mini-PROTEAN\u00ae TGXTM Precast Gels, Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and separated by SDS-PAGE for 1 h at 150 mA. after washes in PBST, the membrane was incubated 1 h at RT with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody HRP-con 1/15 was loaded on 4\u201315% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel and separated by SDS-PAGE as above. protein was transferred on nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h at 70 V for viral protein overlay binding assay. proteins were digested in-gel using trypsin (0.5 g/band, Gold, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) the generated peptides were analyzed online by nano-flow HPLC\u2013nanoelectrospray ionization using a mass spectrometer (thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC. the capillary reverse-phase column (0.075 mm 10 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was fitted with an uncoated silica PicoTip Emitter. all MS/MS spectra were searched using Andromeda against a decoy database containing forward and reverse entities. spectra were searched with a mass tolerance of 7 ppm (MS) and 0.5 Th (MS/MS) Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin. up to two missed cleavages were allowed. cDNAs were cleaved using the NlaIII anchoring enzyme. digested cDNAs were ligated with the GEX adapter 1 containing a restriction site for MmEI. the second digestion with MmeI was performed. the resulting fragments of 85 bp were purified by excision from a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel. the DNA was eluted from the gel using Spin-X Cellulose Acetate Filter (0.45 m), precipitated, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) transcripts from the genome of the Junonia coenia densovirus were analyzed with the same software (FDR set at 0.01) the genome of the Oxford isolate corresponds to the complete genome of the Oxford isolate (Genbank accession number KC883978.1). in vivo bioassays, third-instar (L3) S. frugiperda caterpillars were individually infected by feeding with JcDV (109 veg/caterpillar) or intrahemocelic injection (109 veg/caterpillar) each treatment was applied to a cohort of 24 caterpillars. ilutions of viral inocula (JcDV or P_JcDV; started from 1011 veg/L) were mixed with 25 L of erythrocytes in 96 well microtiter plates for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. hemagglutination was read under a light microscope. a rabbit anti-capsid antibody (1:1,000; Eurogentec) incubated for 2 h at RT and an anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568; 1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) incubated for 45 min at RT. Labeled PMs were then mounted in Dako (Sigma) on coverslips. sacrificed caterpillars were fixed in 4% PFA + 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1h at 4 \u00b0C and dehydrated by incubations in increasing concentrations of ethanol (50% to 100%) semi-thin sections (1 m) were cut in the central part of the caterpillars corresponding to the midgut. images were taken with a CMOS Orca Flash 4.0 camera using fixed parameters for all treatments. 1% of the initial input was loaded on 4\u201315% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel. samples were transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Merck) for 2 h at 200 mA. after washes in PBST, membrane was incubated 1 h at RT with anti-rabbit secondary antibody HRP-conjugated. proteins were also transferred on nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad) for 3 h at 70 V. membrane was saturated with 3% BSA in PBST for 2 h at RT, then incubated OVN at 4 \u00b0C with JcDV. proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence as above. Spectra were acquired with the instrument operating in the information-dependent acquisition mode throughout the HPLC gradient. up to twelve of the most intense ions per cycle were fragmented and analyzed using a resolution set at a value of 70,000. peptides with at least seven amino acids in length were considered. a mass tolerance of 7 ppm (MS) and 0.5 Th (MS/MS) was set to trypsin. only peptides with at least seven amino acids were considered. four libraries were constructed from midgut total RNA extracted from caterpillars infected (or not) for 1 and 3 days. cDNA syntheses were cleaved using the NlaIII anchoring enzyme. second digestion with MmeI was performed, which cuts 17 bp downstream of the CATG site. cluster generation was performed after applying 4 pM of each sample to the individual lanes of the Illumina 1G flowcell. image analysis and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline, where sequence tags were obtained after purity filtering. the average pore size of the PM is around 8 nm in S. frugiperda caterpillars, which might exclude 25 nm densovirus particles. we disrupted its structure by feeding third instar (L3) larvae with sub lethal doses (0.5%) of the chitin-binding agent Calcofluor White prior JcDV infection [40,41,42,43,44] we then measured larval mortality rates daily. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. we first assayed the capsid ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. the first dilutions of the virus inoculum triggered a strong hemolysis of erythrocytes suggesting a toxic effect of the viral inoculum, ie capsids or some host-derived component associated with the inoculum. semi-purified virus (P_JcDV) induced a green coloration in the wells. the wells containing purified virus showed a clear hemagglutination at the lowest dilutions (1:2 to 1:8) to better understand capsid affinity for glycans, we performed a competition bioassay. ex vivo interaction of JcDV with the PM involves carbohydrates. control PMs were incubated with a clarified and filtered homogenate of non-infected caterpillars. bars, 50 m. each independent experiment was repeated at least three times. caterpillars were infected with JcDV mixed or not with 5 mM GlcNAc. labelling was also observed in the lumen, likely revealing JcDV interaction with food bolus and/or microbial components. control caterpillars fed with PBS after ingestion of JcDV alone or JcDV (109 veg/caterpillar) before oral infection. three independent experiments performed, each independent experiment gave similar results. the median time to death was similar for all conditions. we performed competition bioassays in vivo, bypassing the midgut by injecting caterpillars with JcDV mixed or not with 5 mM of each monosaccharide. chitin beads were incubated with JcDV or P_JcDV. control binding assays were performed with non-infected homogenate of caterpillars. western blotting followed by western blotting using a polyclonal anti-JcDV capsid antibody. we included porcine mucins as a control of highly (O-)glycosylated proteins. a set of JcDV-interacting proteins was identified at high molecular weights (>250 kDa) including proteins with a pattern similar to porcine mucins. gene ontology (GO) annotation confirmed the enrichment in proteolytic activities (particularly serine-type endopeptidases) and chitin synthesis. GO terms enrichment for the 138 common annotated PM proteins interacting with JcDV (in green), compared to the reference in grey. we hypothesized that capsids aggregation on the matrix can result in its disorganization, in a way similar to chitin-binding wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin or Calcofluor [53]. we used fluorescent WGA-labelling (WGA-FITC) to label chitin and thus examine chitin fibrils formation and PM organization. caterpillars (L3) were orally infected with JcDV or fed with PBS as a control. at 24 h p.i., semi-thin transversal sections (1 m) were prepared and processed for immunolabeling. the overall intestinal response to JcDV oral infection was poorly affected by virus replication going on in subepithelial tissues. we observed only GO terms enrichment for the over-represented transcripts at 1-day p.i., more specifically in functions involved in metabolic processes including translation (i.e., regulation of biological processes, response to stimuli and signaling) the canonical midgut immune system did not detect JcDV break in and transport across the epithelium. the average pore size of the PM is around 8 nm in S. frugiperda caterpillars, which might exclude 25 nm densovirus particles. caterpillars compared to untreated controls (18% at 10 days p.i.) Calcofluor increases chitin assembly on larval development. larvae were infected individually by feeding with JcDV. L6 caterpillars were fed with up to 3% Calcofluor (not lethal at 24 h post treatment) and PMs were isolated 24 h post-treatment and prepared for SEM analysis. the rapid recognition of the PM by JcDV capsids suggests that their affinity for glycans is important for the oral infection process. hemagglutination with P_JcDV was obtained up to the third dilution. this indicates a rather weak interaction of the capsids with glycans at the surface of (mammalian) erythrocytes. accharides commonly found in insects [47], ie N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), D-Fucose and D-Mannose. we first verified with a dot blot assay that capsids interaction with monosaccharides were not interfering with antibody recognition. we noted that fluorescence quantification did not result in a strictly linear dose-dependent effect. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant (* p 0.05; ** p 0.01; ** p 0.001) to further test the role of glycans in JcDV pathogenesis, we carried out these competition bioassays in vivo. results showed that oral infection with 5 mM (but not 5 M) significantly delayed the median time to death (LT50) of caterpillars. survival curves of caterpillars (n = 24) infected by feeding with JcDV alone. three independent experiments were performed, each independent. the log-rank (Mantel-cox) and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests were used to determine statistical significance. p > 0.05 were considered non-significant (ns) chitin and glycosylated proteins involved in capsid interactions. we first tested capsid physical interaction with chitin using a pull-down assay. chitin beads were incubated with chitin beads, pulled-down by centrifugation. porcine mucins were also loaded in the gel as a control of highly (O-)glycosylated proteins. proteins were then stained with Page blue or Periodic acid Schiff (PAS, pink) to visualize total or glycosylated proteins, respectively, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with JcDV. proteins interacting with JcDV were detected at 150\u2013200 kDa and 25\u201360 kDa. in total, 10 bands representing JcDV interacting proteins are reproducibly obtained with VOPBA. each band probably includes several proteins and/or isoform/glycoform of the same proteins. 155 proteins common to the three replicates were annotated in the reference genome of S. frugiperda. GO terms enrichment for the 138 common annotated PM proteins interacting with JcDV (in green) compared to the reference in grey (predicted proteins from OGS2.2 S. frugiperda genome) the labelling of the PM (green) lined the apical surface of the epithelium in non-infected larvae. however, the labelling lining the epithelium appeared discontinuous following infection. intracellular labelling was no longer observed in the sections from infected caterpillars suggesting an arrest of GlcNAc secretion from the cells. analysis of gene expression approach involves the sequencing and quantification of end tagged short cDNA fragments. tag sequences were mapped to the genome and transcriptome of S. frugiperda ([33,38]) and to the JcDV genome. none of the tags were assigned to viral transcripts. GO terms enrichment between infected and non-infected midgut DGE libraries at 24 h p.i. compared to the S. frugiperda reference genome (in grey) the software was used for the assignation to the GO terms. we only observed few changes including a trehalose transporter and an intestinal mucin. ds display carbohydrate-binding properties that insure recognition of the peritrophic matrix and determine caterpillars oral infection. this primary step of infection results in a series of physiological changes in the midgut including an arrest of chitin synthesis by epithelial cells. however, strong attachment to glycans composing the PM would trap capsids there and thus impair their physical connection with the receptor(s) a high synergism with Calcofluor was obtained at late instars. the structure and composition of the PM can vary as caterpillars grow and feed. the role of PM Glycans in the Species Barrier to densovirus infection is unknown. glycan array represents mammalian glycans, but specific recognition of capsids suggests some specificity in the interaction of the capsid with glycans. insects are particularly \u201chandly\u201d animal models for structure-function assays in vivo. the competition of the capsid with monosaccharides for binding the PM suggests that food components could interfere with infection. it is plausible that food and microbiota can modify the outcome of the densovirus infection, i.e., by directly competing for binding the PM. densoviruses are highly pathogenic for insect pests and vectors. they are considered with a renewed interest as solutions to control harmful insects are lacking. glycans are crucial interacting components of the early JcDV pathogenesis. a high synergism with Calcofluor was obtained at late instars. the structure and composition of the PM can vary as caterpillars grow and feed. the role of PM Glycans in the Species Barrier to densovirus infection is unknown. glycan array represents mammalian glycans, but specific recognition of capsids by paucimannose suggests some specificity in the interaction of the capsid with glycans. glycan array would be of interest to explore glycan ligands affinity and specificity for densovirus capsids. the competition of the capsid with monosaccharides for binding the PM suggests that food components could interfere with infection. it is plausible that food and microbiota can modify the outcome of the densovirus infection, either by directly competing for binding the PM, or indirectly by modulating the composition of the PM. densoviruses are highly pathogenic for insect pests and vectors. they have long stimulated their interest as biocontrol agents or genes vectors. they are considered with renewed interest as solutions to control harmful insects are lacking."}
