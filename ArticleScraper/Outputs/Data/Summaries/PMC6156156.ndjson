{"summary": "peacock (male peafowl) is one of the largest known bird among pheasants and flying birds. it shows sexual dimorphism, polygamy with no paternal care to offspring, and an elaborate male display during courtship. ornamental features are also used as an honest signal about their immunocompetence to the peahen, which helps in the selection of individuals with better immunity. the large train is the default state since the peahen also shows the development of this train after ovariectomy. however, the genomic details about the phenotypic evolution of this species are still unknown. genome-wide analysis of peacock with five other related birds provided novel genomic insights into peacock genome evolution. Approximately 2 ml blood was drawn from the medial metatarsal vein of a 2 years old Indian peacock at Van Vihar National Park, Bhopal, India. lumina NextSeq 500/550 v2 sequencing reagent kit (Illumina Inc., United States) and 150 bp paired-end sequencing were performed for all the libraries. the preprocessing of raw reads was performed, which included filtering, normalization, and error correction. noRNA, and microRNA are mentioned in Supplementary Text S3. Estimation of effective population size (Ne) over time. the autosomal data of the peacock genome sequence was filtered by excluding sites at which the inferred consensus quality was below 20. the minimum length of the contigs selected for the analysis was 5,000 bp based on no more than 25% of the missing data. gene-set was constructed using the combined approach of ab initio gene predictions and homology-based gene predictions. 187 coding gene sequences corresponding to 136 genes had a premature stop codon in their sequence. 130 genes had at least one valid coding transcript. tree construction All sequence alignments (DNA and Protein) used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction were generated using MUSCLE release 3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004). the likelihood-based tree-searching algorithm was used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction using PhyML version 3.1 with the default model of HKY85. the species tree was constructed using NCBI taxonomy. the selected phylogenetic tree had the green anole as an out-group. the GO enrichment analysis was performed using a web-based tool. the functional impact of the identified unique substitutions and other sequence variations were evaluated using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from tolerant) analysis. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from concatenated alignments of orthologs was used for the phylogenetic correction of branch-specific dN/dS values. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequence of these orthologs. positive selection analysis was performed using the Bayesian Empirical Bayes values for the branch-site model A (Zhang J. et al., 2005). unique substitution analysis The positions at which the peacock protein showed amino acid substitutions in comparison to all the other five bird genomes were identified and reported as the unique substitutions. the permission to collect blood samples was obtained from principal chief Conservator of Forests Bhopal. sex of the bird was determined to be male by morphological identification and was confirmed using molecular sexing assay. contigs were assembled using ABySS (v2.0.2) with a k-mer size of 101. BUSCO has defined single-copy gene sets for major clades. a reference-based draft genome assembly was also performed using BWA (v0.5.9). the minimum length of the contigs selected for carrying out the analysis was 5,000 bp based on no more than 25% of the missing data. the resultant filtered genome sequence used for the analysis was 76% of the total genome. generation time and mutation rate are necessary to scale the results of PSMC analysis to real time. 187 coding gene sequences corresponding to 136 genes had a premature stop codon in their sequence. 130 genes had at least one valid coding transcript and were included in the analysis performed in this study. orthologs for peacock coding gene sequences were identified in the other bird genomes using the RBH approach through BLASTN. the default HKY85 model was used to construct the phylogenies of individual genes and mitochondrial genome. the binary-coded phylogeny was constructed using RAxML version 8.2.10. bootstrap technique was employed to test for the robustness of the constructed phylogenetic trees. the phylogenetic tree had the green anole as an out-group. the phylogenetic tree had the green anole as an out-group. the significance of two-lambda model was assessed against a global lambda model. pairwise dN/dS analysis was performed on the pair-wise orthologous genes for seven different pairs. genes with dN/dS values >5 and between 1 and 1.2 were not used for the function interpretation of results. the maximum Likelihood-based (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequence of these orthologs. a revised branch-site model was performed to identify the signatures of positive selection in peacock for the considered coding gene sequence. pairwise dN/dS analysis was performed on the pair-wise orthologous genes for seven different pairs. genes with dN/dS values >5 and between 1 and 1.2 were not used for the function interpretation of results. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from concatenated alignments of orthologs was used for the phylogenetic correction of branch-specific dN/dS values. positive selection analysis The multiple sequence alignment for each peacock coding gene sequence and the corresponding orthologs identified using RBH approach. peacock coding gene sequence and its orthologs identified from the five bird genomes were translated using EMBOSS transeq. the protein sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE release 3.8.31. the functional impact of these unique amino acid substitutions was predicted using a psi-BLAST based computational tool: SIFT. BUSCO scores assessed the genome assembly to be 77.6% complete (S: 63.4%, D: 14.2%) and 8.9% as missing BUSCOs. a final set of 24,831 transcripts and 15,970 protein-coding genes was constructed for peacock. peacock showed 2,051,161 heterozygous SNVs at a rate of 2.05 SNV per Kb. the observed SNV rate in peacock was closer to turkey in comparison to the other avian species. phylogenetic analysis performed using the coding sequences of 5,907 orthologous genes identified from the six bird genomes. the maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed from the concatenated alignments of orthologous genes with a bootstrap value of 1,000. the phylogeny for these taxa is well-studied, and Passeriformes and Galliformes orders are known to form the valid groups since 19th century. the origin of turkey was estimated to be 37.2 MYA. the origin of peacock and chicken was estimated to be 32.9 MYA. the original phylogeny from the data had a polytomy due to which the split point between zebra finch and flycatcher could not be identified. we constructed the maximum likelihood phylogeny for each of the 5,907 orthologs. a total of 2,581 (43.7%) orthologs showed the support for topology t1, 1,674 (28.3%) orthologs showed the support for topology t2, 1,376 (23.3%) showed the support for topology t3, and 263 (4.4%) showed support very different from t1, t2, and t3. the divergence point between flycatcher and zebra finch was derived from the species divergence time from TimeTree. the divergence time is derived from the timeTree database (Hedges et al., 2006), where the divergence time of peacock and chicken is 33 MYA. early divergence of Galliformes and Anseriformes is supported by the Next-generation DNA sequencing data from 259 loci. the divergence time of peacock and chicken was suggested to be during the period of Oligocene (23\u201335 MYA) based on fossil and DNA sequence (nuclear and mitochondrial) data. the mitochondrial phylogeny was also constructed separately for the six bird species. the mitochondrial phylogeny was consistent with the most supported nuclear topology t1, genome-wide ultraconserved elements based phylogeny. the phylogenetic analysis carried out using nuclear-genes and mitochondrial genomes in this study revealed that peacock is closer to chicken as compared to turkey (supports the topology t1). this resolves the phylogenetic position of peacock with respect to the well-studied modern bird phylogeny. phylogenetic tree topology t1 is having maximum support in terms of bootstrap values and tree distance from individual gene trees. it is apparent that the common ancestor to the birds in the phylogenetic tree show a loss of 2,295 genes. this is supported by a previous report mentioning the loss of around 2,000 genes in the ancestor as compared to other vertebrate lines. the top 20 protein families featuring gain and loss in the peacock genome are listed in Supplementary Datas S10, S11. all the top 20 families that showed contraction in peacock belonged to the hypothetical protein family or had no known function. 74 genes showed the values >1, of which 25 genes had values above five. 22 genes had values between 1.0 and 1.2, which may indicate the relaxation of constraint rather than positive selection. the remaining 47 genes were not considered for the functional interpretation. the functional analysis revealed the role of these genes in key cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (MAPK, RAS, PI3K-Akt, ErbB, Hippo, Rap1, and Jak-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, calcium signaling and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes) and immune response (T cell receptor, Toll-like receptor signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascade and chemokine- early developmental pathways show adaptive divergence in peacock. otypes Adaptive Evolution of early developmental pathways. the TGF- pathway regulates the cartilage connective tissue development. the notch-2 receptor gene of notch-Delta signaling also showed five unique substitutions. unique substitutions were also found in the FGFR3 receptor gene and FGF23 genes. adapted evolution in immune-related genes is usually higher than the other genes. several genes involved in the development of immune system have shown sequence divergence and signs of adaptive evolution in the peacock genome. the -subunit of C8 protein involved in forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) showed MSA. proteins involved in T-cell activation showed sequence divergence and MSA in peacock. the gene family SSC4D involved in the development of immune system and regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity showed expansion in peacock in comparison to chicken. genome scaffold and contig N50s were 25.6 and 19.3 Kb respectively. BUSCO scores assessed the genome assembly to be 77.6% complete. a final set of 24,831 transcripts and 15,970 protein-coding genes was constructed for peacock. a total of 5,907 combined orthologs could be identified across all six species. comparison of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between chicken and peacock revealed 2,051,161 heterozygous SNVs at a rate of 2.05 SNV per Kb. peacock suffered at least two bottlenecks (around four million and 450,000 years ago) which resulted in a severe reduction in its effective population size. the maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed from the concatenated alignments of orthologous genes with a bootstrap value of 1,000. the phylogeny for these taxa is well-studied, and Passeriformes and Galliformes orders are known to form the valid groups since 19th century. the divergence time of different bird species was determined using the timeTree database. the origin of turkey was estimated to be 37.2 MYA. the origin of turkey was estimated to be 37.2 MYA. the origin of peacock and chicken was estimated to be 32.9 MYA. a total of 2,581 (43.7%) orthologs showed the support for topology t1, 1,674 (28.3%) orthologs showed the support for topology t2, 1,376 (23.3%) showed the support for topology t3, and 263 (4.4%) showed support for topology very different from t1, t2, and t3. the divergence point between flycatcher and zebra finch was derived from the species divergence time from TimeTree (Hedges et al., 2006). the divergence time is derived from the timeTree database (Hedges et al., 2006), where the divergence time of peacock and chicken is 33 MYA. this early divergence of Galliformes and Anseriformes is also supported by the Next-generation DNA sequencing data from 259 loci (Prum et al., 2015). the divergence time of peacock and chicken was suggested to be during the period of Oligocene (23\u201335 MYA) based on fossil and DNA sequence (nuclear and mitochondrial) data. the mitochondrial phylogeny was constructed separately for the six bird species. the phylogeny was consistent with the most supported nuclear topology t1, genome-wide ultraconserved elements based phylogeny. the mitochondrial phylogeny was also constructed separately for the six bird species. the phylogenetic analysis carried out using nuclear-genes and mitochondrial genomes in this study revealed that peacock is closer to chicken as compared to turkey. this resolves the phylogenetic position of peacock with respect to the well-studied modern bird phylogeny. phylogenetically corrected analysis is usually more preferred but could include only 5,907 orthologs. phylogenetic tree topology t1 was used for phylogenetic correction. the phylogenetic tree with the gene gain and gene loss values for the six bird genomes and the outlier green anole is displayed in Figure 3B. the top 20 protein families featuring gain and loss in the peacock genome are listed in Supplementary Datas S10, S11. all the top 20 families that showed contraction in peacock belonged to the hypothetical protein family or had no known function. the pair-wise dN/dS values were determined for all the pair-wise orthologs of peacock. 74 genes showed the values >1, of which 25 genes had values above five indicating possible false positives. the remaining 47 genes were not considered for the functional interpretation. the functional analysis revealed the role of these genes in key cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (MAPK, RAS, PI3K-Akt, ErbB, Hippo, Rap1, and Jak-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, calcium signaling and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes). phylogenetic position of peacock was determined using a maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis performed using the coding sequences of 5,907 orthologous genes identified from the six bird genomes. the maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed from the concatenated alignments of orthologous genes with a bootstrap value of 1,000. the divergence time of different bird species was determined using the timeTree database. the origin of turkey was estimated to be 37.2 MYA. the origin of turkey was estimated to be 37.2 MYA. the origin of peacock and chicken was estimated to be 32.9 MYA. a total of 2,581 (43.7%) orthologs showed the support for topology t1, 1,674 (28.3%) orthologs showed the support for topology t2, 1,376 (23.3%) showed the support for topology t3, and 263 (4.4%) showed support for topology very different from t1, t2, and t3. \u201ct1\u201d in this study is also supported by the phylogenies constructed using different types of data such as non-coding intron (Kimball and Braun, 2014; Hosner et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a) this suggests the robustness of the t1 topology-based phylogeny. the divergence point between the two Passerines, flycatcher and zebra finch, could not be estimated. this early divergence of Galliformes and Anseriformes is also supported by the Next-generation DNA sequencing data from 259 loci. the divergence time of peacock and chicken was suggested to be during the period of Oligocene (23\u201335 MYA) based on fossil and DNA sequence (nuclear and mitochondrial) data. the divergence of peacock and chicken was estimated to be 25\u201330 MYA. the mitochondrial phylogeny was also constructed separately for the six bird species. the mitochondrial phylogeny was consistent with the most supported nuclear topology t1, genome-wide ultraconserved elements based phylogeny. the phylogenetic analysis carried out using nuclear-genes and mitochondrial genomes in this study revealed that peacock is closer to chicken as compared to turkey (supports the topology t1) this resolves the phylogenetic position of peacock with respect to the well-studied modern bird phylogeny. gene gain/loss analysis was performed for six bird genomes. phylogenetic tree topology t1 was used for phylogenetic correction. it is apparent that the common ancestor to the birds in the phylogenetic tree show a loss of 2,295 genes. the top 20 protein families featuring gain and loss in the peacock genome are listed in Supplementary Datas S10, S11. all the top 20 families that showed contraction in peacock belonged to the hypothetical protein family or had no known function. 74 genes showed the values >1, of which 25 genes had values above five indicating possible false positives. 22 genes had values between 1.0 and 1.2, which may indicate the relaxation of constraint rather than positive selection. a total of 437 genes displayed signs of positive selection identified using branch-site model-A. the functional analysis revealed the role of these genes in key cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (MAPK, RAS, PI3K-Akt, ErbB, Hippo, Rap1, and Jak-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, calcium signaling and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes). early developmental pathways show adaptive divergence in peacock. the TGF- pathway regulates the cartilage connective tissue development. the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in development, regeneration, aging process. unique substitutions were found in the notch-2 receptor gene of notch-Delta signaling. unique substitutions were also found in the FGFR3 receptor gene and FGF23 genes, which are part of the FGF signaling involved in limb and skeletal muscle development, feather development and morphogenesis. several genes involved in the development of immune system and modulation of immune response have shown sequence divergence and signs of adaptive evolution in the peacock genome. multiple components of the innate immune system such as complement system and pathogen recognition system showed adaptive evolution. gene family SSC4D involved in the development of immune system and regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity showed expansion in peacock. several other genes having implications for immune system development and response have shown adaptive evolution in peacock. the TGF- pathway regulates the cartilage connective tissue development. it also regulates the initial placement of feather buds and their consolidation within the feather field. the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in development, regeneration, aging process. s were also found in the FGFR3 receptor gene and FGF23 genes. the multiple signs of evolution observed in the genes of early development pathways in peacock suggest the adaptive divergence in early development processes. feather development in birds is primarily guided by the continuous reciprocal interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. the -subunit of C8 protein involved in forming the membrane attack complex showed MSA. the CSF-1R gene, which is crucial for macrophage survival, differentiation, and proliferation, also showed positive selection with positively selected sites and unique substitutions. the gene family SSC4D involved in the development of immune system showed expansion in peacock in comparison to chicken (Supplementary Data Sheet S1) other genes having implications for immune system development and response have shown adaptive evolution in peacock. it suggests that the immune system-related genes in peacock genome have adaptively evolved. phylogenetic analysis of peacock genome using orthologous gene sequences revealed that it is closer to chicken in comparison to turkey. a major fraction of genes involved in early development showed multiple signs of adaptive evolution in the feather-specific gene set. unique substitution(s), the symbol \u201cPS\u201d stands for only positive selection, the symbol \u201cB2\u201d stands for unique substitution(s) and positive selection. overall genes do not show any positive selection, and the symbol \u201cB2\u201d stands for unique substitution(s) this problem is common in genome-wide analysis and some approaches to address the problem can inflate the false positives, whereas others may increase the rate of false negatives. the comparative genomic analysis presented in this work provides novel insights on the phenotypic evolution of Indian Peacock.
