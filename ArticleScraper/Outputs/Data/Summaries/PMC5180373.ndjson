{"summary": "a novel lineage C betacoronavirus, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent of MERS.2, 3 Subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa has suggested that these animals may be hosts for an ancestor of MERS-CoV. ERS-CoV strain is a unique member of a cluster of closely related MERS-CoV strains obtained from patients in the Hafr-Al-Batin region of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. the results support a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse strains from multiple sources in the same farm. RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted from the cultures using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was eluted in 60 L of Buffer AVE and was used as the template for RT-PCR. cDNA was amplified by a combined random priming and oligo(dT) priming strategy. phylogenetic analysis Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed using PhyML v3.0 (Montpellier, France) the best-fit substitution model was selected using jModelTest and used in the maximum-likelihood analysis. possible recombination sites suggested by the bootscan analysis were confirmed through multiple sequence alignments. ination detection methods in the ten genomes in this study were further analyzed with phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination breakpoint. the trees were summarized in a target tree by using the Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package. two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 L of minimum essential medium. after 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. the cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. the 5\u2032 ends in the viral genomes were confirmed via rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit. genome analysis Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and the full genomes of 10 MERS-CoV were aligned with 85 human MERS-CoV and 87 camel MERS-CoV genomes. can analysis, possible recombination breakpoints were also detected using RDP, GENECONV, BOOTSCAN, MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE, CHIMAERA, SISCAN and 3Seq. potential recombination events detected by four or more of the seven independent recombination detection methods in the ten genomes in this study were further analyzed. nucleotide sequences of the ten dromedary MERS-CoV genomes sequenced in this study have been submitted to the GenBank sequence database under accession nos. KX108937\u2013KX108946. the median age of the dromedaries was 1 month (range: 15 days to nine months) two of the eight dead dromedaries exhibited nasal discharge before they died. dairy farm in Dubai D383/15 B1 F/1 month 14 Feb, 2015 Nasal swab Dead (colisepticemia) Dairy farm in Dubai D998/15 A2 F/1 month 23 April, 2015 Nasal swab Dead (white muscle disease and clostridiosis) Dairy farm in Dubai D1157/15 B5 F/1 month 12 May, 2015 Nasal swab Dead (nasal discharge, pneumonia) dromedary calf from a special dairy farm in Dubai is a unique member of clade A. this is closely related to another dromedary isolate, NRCE-HKU205. these two isolates formed a separate cluster distinct from the other two known clade A strains, EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012. maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on genome sequences of 182 MERS-CoV strains. a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with estimated base frequencies, the proportion of invariant sites, and the gamma distribution of rates across sites were used in the maximum-likelihood analysis. clade A1, clade A2 and the six lineages of B strains showed a total of 16 substitutions, most occurring in the viral nsp3 and S proteins. two substitutions in nsp3, at positions 1574 and 1717, were found within the catalytic domain of PLpro. the two lineage three strains in this study were found to cluster more closely with lineage 4 and lineage 5 MERS-CoV in the tree constructed for ORF1a and ORF1b. the remaining eight strains identified in this study were found to consistently cluster within the same lineages in all three trees. bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments were performed for both strains. recombination breakpoints were detected in the two genomes at positions 14958 and 28835. phylogenetic trees constructed using nucleotide sequences of non-recombination regions (A) and recombination regions (B) detected using RDP4. the divergence time of the present 10 dromedary strains was 8.55 104 (95% HPD: 7.09 104, 1.01 103) on the basis of time-resolved phylogeny, the root of the tree is January 2011 (95% HPD: June 2010, August 2011). the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA of clade A was dated back to March 2011 (95% HPD: August 2010, September 2011) and that of clade B strains isolated and sequenced in this study are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. median age of the dromedaries was 1 month (range: 15 days to nine months) two of the eight dead dromedaries exhibited nasal discharge before they died. the number of dromedaries corresponds to the number of MERS-CoV isolates from the sampling location. phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes of the ten sequenced MERS-CoV isolates showed that one isolate belongs to clade A, and nine belong to clade B. ten MERS-CoVs from dromedaries are indicated in black circles. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the ten MERS-CoVs from dromedaries are indicated in black circles. the 10 MERS-CoV strains sequenced in the present study are colored: blue, Dubai; brown, Umm Al Quwain; green, Saudi Arabia. the 10 MERS-CoV strains sequenced in the present study are colored: blue, Dubai; brown, Umm Al Quwain; green, Saudi Arabia. nine amino acid substitutions between clade A and B strains and five amino acid substitutions between clade A and B strains. the nine clade A dromedary isolates belong to three distinct lines. five isolates from a dairy farm in Dubai and one from a breeding herd returning from Saudi Arabia belong to lineage 1. bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 4 MERS-CoV in two parts of their genomes. bootscan analysis showed high bootstrap support for clustering between the two strains and lineage 5 MERS-CoV in two parts of their genomes. recombination breakpoints were detected in the two genomes at positions 14958 and 28835. phylogenetic trees constructed using concatenated nucleotides sequences from position 1 to 14957 and 28836 to 30087. the recombination region is approximately positions 14958 to 28835. the time-scaled phylogeny was summarized from all Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenies of the concatenated coding regions (ORF1ab, S, E, M and N) of 90 phylogenetically distinct MERS-CoV genomes. the 10 MERS-CoV genomes sequenced in this study are in boldface. for the eight MERS-CoV strains isolated from dromedaries in the UAE, one belongs to the dromedary was from a herd of approximately 50 female breeding dromedaries in Dubai. each year, these camels were brought to Saudi Arabia for 6 months. young dromedaries are usually removed from the herd and start their training as racing camels when they are one year old. a single interspecies transmission event probably occurred from bats to palm civets as the intermediate or amplification host. the rapid expansion of the epidemic arose after efficient human-to-human transmission of the human SARS-CoV strains. this finding is in line with the overall MERS-CoV phylogeny in the Middle East. clade A strains may consist of two distinct lines: one from humans (A1) and one from camels (A2) further studies to isolate and sequence more clade A strains may provide insights on the role of clade A strains in MERS-CoV evolution. bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments did not reveal evidence of recombination for strain D2731.3/14. only strains D1271/15 (from Dubai) and D1189.1/15 (from Umm Al Quwain) showed evidence of recombination."}
