{"summary": "mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, MHV, MVM, MPV, mouse adenoviruses (MAV1 and 2), mouse norovirus (MNV), pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, mouse rotavirus, sendai virus, and TMEV. for part 2, we obtained 2 to 4 mice from each of 6 local pet stores and tested them for ect all mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose. blood, feces, sections of the cecum and colon, a pelage swab, and the pelt were obtained from each mouse at the time of necropsy. sera from all mice in part 1 were tested for antibodies to MPV. pelts were placed in a culture dish and examined microscopically under low power (magnification, 10) for evidence of adult endoparasites. pelage swabs were submitted for fur mite PCR. PCR assays. conditions for mite PCR assays were: 2 min at 94 \u00b0C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 92 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C, 120 s at 72 \u00b0C; and 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. RNA from MHV, TMEV, MNV, reovirus, and murine rotavirus were detected via RT-PCR by using the Brilliant II SYBR Green qRT\u2013PCR 1-step kit.

MPV was detected in 38% of contact sentinels by serology. the vast majority (29 of 35) of pet-store mice were infested with pinworms. 9 were positive for A. tetraptera alone, 2 were positive for S. obvelata alone. 18 were positive for both agents. all pet-store mice were seronegative for TMEV, but the majority (80%) were positive by fecal RT-PCR. TMEV was transmitted to less than a quarter of the soiled-bedding sentinels. detection by fecal RT-PCR showed no significant variation in transmission according to age. only 17% of pet-store mice (44% of pet-store cages) were positive for MAV2. only 56% of contact sentinels showed evidence of MAV2 infection. only 22% of contact sentinels and none of the soiled-bedding sentinels were positive for DNA from Helicobacter spp. fur mites. a single soiled-bedding exposure was insufficient for transmission of Helicobacter spp. all (91%) pet-store mice were positive for MPV by serology. only about half (54%) were positive by fecal PCR. MPV was detected in 38% of contact sentinels by serology and 22% by fecal PCR. pinworm detection and speciation was performed by both direct examination and PCR of the cecal and colonic contents. results for direct exam and PCR agreed in terms of presence or absence of infestation. PCR was superior for speciation of pinworms. all of the pet-store mice were seronegative for TMEV, but the majority (80%) were positive by fecal RT-PCR. TMEV was transmitted to less than a quarter of the soiled-bedding sentinels. detection by fecal RT-PCR showed no significant variation in transmission according to age. only 17% of pet-store mice were positive for MHV by serology. only 56% of contact sentinels showed evidence of MAV2 infection. only 56% of contact sentinels showed evidence of MAV2 infection. only 22% of contact sentinels and none of the soiled-bedding sentinels were positive for DNA from Helicobacter spp. a single soiled-bedding exposure was insufficient for transmission of Helicobacter spp. fur mites. only about half (54%) were positive by fecal PCR. the vast majority (29 of 35) of pet-store mice were infested with pinworms. 9 were positive for A. tetraptera alone, 2 were positive for S. obvelata alone, and 18 were positive for both agents. uluris tetraptera alone, Syphacia obvelata alone, and for both organisms concurrently (dual infestation) despite dual infestation in 8 of the 9 cages of pet-store mice, only S. obvelata was detected in 5 of 8 contact sentinels. k-old (red), 12-wk-old (green), and 44-wk old (purple) soiled-bedding sentinels tested positive for TMEV. RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of 2 regions indicated 93% to 97% nucleotide identity in the VP0 region and 86% to 97% nucleotide identity in the P2 region among the 6 isolates. only 17% of pet-store mice (44% of pet-store cages) were positive for MNV RNA. transmission to contact or 4- and 12-wk-old soiled bedding sentinels was not detected. only 56% of contact sentinels showed evidence of MAV2 infection. transmission of fur mites to soiled-bedding sentinels did not occur. no significant difference in transmission of MPV to outbred bedding sentinels. age of exposure of ICR mice to MPV was critical factor. mice younger than 4 wk are more susceptible to persistent viral infection than older mice. but it is impractical to submit sentinels at 4 wk of age to see if earlier submission of sentinels improves the detection of MPV. the difference observed between transmission of MPV from experimentally inoculated index mice and naturally infected pet-store mice. the use of pet-store mice allowed for the assessment of susceptibility to infectious agents for which experimental stocks are not readily available (for example, pinworms) there is scant to no recent literature regarding age susceptibility to infection with these agents. the aspiculuris spp. worm burden was equivalent among female mice infected at 4- to 24-wk of age with 500 eggs. this conclusion is contrary to the findings of another study, in which the aspiculuris spp. worm burden was equivalent among female mice infected with 500 eggs. TMEV detection by serology compared with fecal RT-PCR was notable. all pet-store mice were seronegative for TMEV, but 80% were positive by fecal RT-PCR, but all were seronegative. at least 4 viruses are members of the Theilovirus genus (TMEV), rat theilovirus, and the human viruses Saffold and Vilyuisk. RT-PCR amplification, sequencing, and multiple-sequence alignment of 2 regions from viral strains detected were closely related to each other. 80% of soiled-bedding sentinels tested positive serologically for MNV. at least one mouse in all pet-store cages was positive for MAV2. feces from only 37% of pet store mice were MAV2 PCR positive. 2 of the Helicobacter species detected in the index mice were H. bilis and H. muridarum. after experimental inoculation, shedding of Helicobacter spp. DNA was not detected until 3 wk after inoculation. current data show no apparent benefit to submitting sentinels every 3 mo. PCR detects active infection with shedding and potential for transmission. serology detects past infection, requiring at least 7 d."}
