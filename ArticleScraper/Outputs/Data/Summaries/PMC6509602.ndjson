{"summary": "the 21st century confronts us with profound global challenges such as food, water and energy security, reduced resilience of our planet\u2019s life-giving ecosystems and threats from emerging and antimicrobial-resistant infections. the spread of infectious diseases is now ranked second only to water crises as the global risk with the greatest likelihood and potential impact. a set of open-ended questions were considered broadly representative group of experts from human, animal, plant, ecosystem and policy areas box 2. participants from different disciplinary backgrounds then took part in small group (8\u201310 people) discussions. box 1. Traditional and previously underemphasised reasons for biodiversity conservation*. open-ended questions addressed by lead discussants with a focus on emerging and antimicrobial-resistant infections. open-ended questions What scenario keeps you awake at night? What issues do you think require public consultation/involvement in decision-making? EID, Emerging Infectious Disease. Table 2. Key barriers and proposed solutions Rapid loss of interest after a crisis is resolved Health security to be given standing priority. Separation of animal and human disease data, research and policy Identify overlapping issues in human and animal health. create national oversight body containing human, animal and environmental health experts. encourage cross-discipline collaboration at Commonwealth and state levels. pathogen surveillance In the absence of systematic pathogen surveillance in wildlife and domestic animals, human cases often act as sentinel events that alert public health officials to a new infection of animal origin. the risk of infections spreading from wildlife reservoirs into human populations is exacerbated by the expansion of agriculture and mining into natural environments, road infrastructure, deforestation and subsistence hunting. the impact of climate change, particularly on water and vector-borne diseases, was highlighted as a key concern. the impact of climate change, particularly on water and vector-borne diseases, was highlighted as a key concern. risk assessment and modelling to predict the most likely eventualities in advance are important to guide mitigation strategies. key barriers and proposed solutions Strengthening public health systems, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, is essential to achieve core IHR capacities. effective public communication in times of uncertainty poses a major challenge. Detailed scenario planning will help to identify priority actions and communication strategies to reassure the public that the situation is under control. there is no formal framework within academic institutions or government to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration. pathogen surveillance In general, inter-relationships between animal reservoirs and amplifying hosts are poorly characterised. human cases often act as sentinel events that alert public health officials to a new infection of animal origin. the risk of infections spreading from wildlife reservoirs into human populations is exacerbated by the expansion of agriculture and mining into natural environments. the australian government committed $A300 million over 5 years 2017\u20132022 to the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security,20. the synthesis of data on the ecology and evolutionary biology of various organisms provides enhanced understanding of pathogen emergence. but information on the social mechanisms that underpin disease outbreaks and persistence remains rudimentary. risk assessment and modelling to predict the most likely eventualities in advance are important to guide mitigation strategies. key barriers and proposed solutions Strengthening public health systems, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, is essential to achieve core IHR capacities. the rockefeller-Lancet commission identified three important strategies, adopting a threshold approach, scenario planning and resilience thinking. these require pre-emptive scoping of relevant risks, as well as possible scenarios and outcomes associated with identified courses of action. effective public communication in times of uncertainty poses a major challenge. key barriers and proposed solutions relating to AMR and antimicrobial use Key barriers Proposed solutions Potentially divisive arguments of human versus animal use Develop joint national AMR Strategy with input from all sectors. limited funding for multidisciplinary research Provide funding avenues for multidisciplinary research, especially those combining human, animal and environmental health. strengthen international/regional AMR legislation, improved governance and stewardship should be key international development outcomes. an imposed tax may limit or distort appropriate use in people who really need antibiotics. antimicrobial use in production animals has been restricted in Australia. at least 30% of prescriptions are judged to be clinically inappropriate, inadequate or unnecessary. evidence of previously unrecognised harm related to impacts on the human microbiome should inform development of novel strategies to optimise antimicrobial use. lack of funding for cross-disciplinary research was identified as a significant barrier. lack of funding for cross-disciplinary research was identified as a significant barrier. new economic models should reward antimicrobial discovery. avoparcin use in feedlot cattle was shown to increase the prevalence of Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. avoparcin use in feedlot cattle was shown to increase the prevalence of Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. it was voluntarily withdrawn from the Australian market. at least 30% of prescriptions are judged to be clinically inappropriate, inadequate or unnecessary. evidence of previously unrecognised harm related to impacts on the human microbiome should inform development of novel strategies to optimise antimicrobial use. lack of funding for cross-disciplinary research was identified as a significant barrier. few new antimicrobials have been developed in recent years. new economic models should reward antimicrobial discovery. the national AMR Strategy35emphasises the need for a coordinated One Health approach. implementation within existing government structures remains challenging without significant internal reform. public education should also target politicians and key decision-makers. other regional mechanisms and forums include the south Pacific Commission, the East Asia Summit and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. encourage adequate funding of DFAT\u2019s regional health security strategy."}
