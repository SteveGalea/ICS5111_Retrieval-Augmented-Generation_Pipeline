{"summary": "no studies have explored the role of environmental factors on severity of influenza infection. a Poisson regression model was applied to the mortality data of two cities. the association between absolute humidity and mortality risks was found consistent among the cities. extreme weather conditions could have a synergistic effect with influenza on mortality burden. both cold and hot temperatures have been associated with increased mortality risks of respiratory diseases in numerous studies. annual averages of 35,256 and 1,872 specimens were tested by the DH and GDCDC. mortality data for the period of 2004-2006 were obtained from the Hong Kong census and Statistics Department and the Guangzhou Department of Health. the population denominator of Guangzhou did not change much during the study period. a generalized additive model (GAM) with a log link function and Poisson error was fitted to the weekly numbers of deaths. long-term trends and seasonal patterns of cause-specific mortality counts, as well as environmental factors including temperature and relative humidity were adjusted for as confounders. the main effects of influenza have been presented elsewhere. we added into the core model the product terms of influenza proportion variable and dummy variables for periods of normal and extreme (high or low) weather conditions as interaction terms between virus activity and environmental factors. we chose two sets of extra cutoff points: 20th and 80th, 30th and 70th percentiles of weekly average data in each city. the remaining uncontrolled seasonal factors may cause interaction terms of environmental factors and virus activity to appear significant in our models. annual averages of 35,256 and 1,872 specimens were tested by the DH and GDCDC. mortality data for the period of 2004-2006 were obtained from the census and statistics department and the Guangzhou Department of Health. a generalized additive model (GAM) with a log link function and Poisson error was fitted to the weekly numbers of deaths. long-term trends and seasonal patterns of cause-specific mortality counts, as well as environmental factors including temperature and relative humidity were adjusted for as confounders by building a core model. the main effects of influenza have been presented elsewhere [21]. to explore the effect modification of environmental factors on influenza associated mortality, we added into the core model the product terms of influenza proportion variable and dummy variables for periods of normal and extreme weather conditions. g e = exp 0. 0 1 * 1 - 1 * 1 00 (5) Here 1 was obtained from the above interaction model. we chose two sets of extra cutoff points: 20th and 80th percentiles of weekly average data in each city. the remaining uncontrolled seasonal factors may cause interaction terms of environmental factors and virus activity to appear significant in our models. pressure and counts of all-cause deaths Percentile Variable City Mean SD min. 25 50 75 max Temperature (\u00b0C) Guangzhou 23.0 5.8 8.1 18.4 24.5 27.8 31.7 Hong Kong 23.4 4.9 11.8 19.2 24.8 27.7 30.5 Relative humidity (%) Guangzhou 70.0 10.3 31.4 63.6 71.8 76.8 89.9 Hong Kong 78.9 7.5 53.9 75.5 80.0 84.6 90.9 VP ( e All-cause Guangzhou 520.5 (81.4) 424.0 (52.1) 407.3 (49.0) Hong Kong 798.6 (73.5) 677.5 (48.6) 655.9 (36.6) CRD Guangzhou 300.5 (61.6) 227.1 (43.6) 213.4 (37.4) Hong Kong 382.7 (47.5) 296.4 (35.3) 275.6 (25.4) P&I Guangzhou 11.3 (4.9) 9.7 (4.3) 9.5 (3.3) Hong Kong 90.8 (15. virus % Guangzhou 4.3 (5.3) 8.3 (10.5) 10.8 (11.1) Hong Kong 9.9 (9.4) 12.1 (11.2) 14.9 (11.3) SD standard deviation; CRD cardiorespiratory; P&I pneumonia and influenza Significant interaction between temperature and influenza on the mortality risks was only found in cardiorespiratory mortality in both cities.
