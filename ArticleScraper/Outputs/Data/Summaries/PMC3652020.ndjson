HEK-293 and 16HBE14o cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant cDNAs by using XtremeGene HP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) both HEK-293 and 16HBE14o cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant cDNAs. time course recordings obtained by applying consecutive voltages of 60 mV to +60 mV in 20-mV increments for 500 ms from a holding potential of 0 mV. inhibitor-sensitive currents in HEK-293 CFTR-wt were calculated by subtracting remaining currents after perfusion with recording solutions containing forskolin, IBMX, GlyH-101 (20 M), and PPQ-102 (10 M) (49) both samples were rotated in a labquake Rotisserie Shaker (Thermo Scientific) for at least 1 h and centrifuged again at 17,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. the pellet was then resuspended in RIPA buffer. membranes were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. membranes were then probed with antibody against CFTR (596 provided by John Riordan. a 96-well Luminometer (BMG Labtech FLUOstar OPTIMA, Ortenberg, Germany) was used for statistical analysis for comparison of two groups. the comparison of statistical significance among three or more groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance. 16HBE14o cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line (17), were maintained in MEM (minimum essential media; Cellgro, Manassas, VA) all plates were coated with 30 g/ml collagen (BD Biosciences), 10 g/ml human fibronectin (BD Biosciences) and 100 g/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to seeding. cRNAs encoding the human, and subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), CFTR, M2 and M2 mutants were generated previously as described (30). plasmids [CFTR in pcDNA3 (45), ENaC, M2 and M2 mutants in pcDNA3.1] were linearized by restriction digestion and sense RNA was in vitro transcribed from an upstream T7 promoter. currents were sampled at the rate of 1 kHz, filtered at 1 kHz. CFTR channel activity was induced by addition of 10 M forskolin and 100 M IBMX in the perfusing solution. individual cells expressing green fluorescence were patched in the whole cell mode (30) using pipettes with an electrical resistance of 3\u20135 m. HEK cells were perfused with bath solutions containing forskolin (10 M) and IBMX (100 M) Isolation of total and membrane proteins from Xenopus oocytes. whole oocyte lysate (WOL) and total membrane proteins (TMP) were obtained. for WOL, 10\u201320 oocytes were washed three times in ND96. cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. cells were then incubated on ice for 15 min, and quenched three times with 50 mM Tris buffer. protein concentrations were measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit. signal detected by addition of chemiluminescence substrates and exposure to Fuji medical X-ray films. signals normalized to total protein, as quantified by Amido black staining. CFTR and M2 coinjected oocytes had a similar morphology to water-injected oocytes. oocytes coinjected with M2 had significantly less forskolin-stimulated activity than water-coinjected control oocytes. lyH-101-sensitive currents were calculated by subtracting remaining current after GlyH-101 from forskolin- and IBMX-stimulated currents. oocytes were perfused with recording solution at neutral pH (7.6) and then perfused with 10 M forskolin and 100 M IBMX (FORSK) to activate CFTR. CFTR current was confirmed by perfusion with ND96 pH 7.6 + 10 M forskolin, 100 M IBMX western blot and densitometry of oocytes coinjected with CFTR. values were normalized to CFTR+H2O-injected controls. matrix protein 1 (M1) is encoded by the same viral gene segment as M2 (44). oocytes were injected with a cRNA encoding the calcium channel, TRPV5. we measured currents in the presence and absence of various concentrations of injected M2 cRNA. Xenopus oocytes were injected with TRPV5 and 24 h later were coinjected with either water or varying concentrations of M2. current was activated by the removal of divalent cations and inhibited by the calcium channel blocker lanthanum. total current in oocytes coinjected with CFTR and either water or M2 followed by incubation with either 100 M EUK-134 or vehicle for 48 h. all values are means 1 SE. ***P 0.001, significantly different from water-injected control by Student's t-test, or by ANOVA for 3 or more groups. oocytes injected with CFTR exhibited large inward H+ currents. oocytes injected with M2-V27F or M2-G34V showed little or no current respectively. M2-V27F also inhibited CFTR activity to a lesser extent. oocytes were coinjected with CFTR and either water (n = 119), M2 (n = 110) M2-G34V (n = 77), or M2-V27F (n = 12). oocytes were coinjected with cRNAs encoding epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and 2. CFTR-injected oocytes with either ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (3) or concanamycin A (18) decreased CFTR activity in a dose-dependent manner. twenty-four hours post-CFTR injection, various concentrations of NH4Cl and concanamycin A (ConA) were added to the incubation media. all values are means 1 SE. *P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001, significantly different from water-injected control by Student's t-test. a previously characterized M2 mutant containing a dilysine sequence that causes the protein to be retained in the ER (M2-ER) CFTR band C protein normalized to CFTR+H2O-injected controls. oocytes were incubated with vehicle or indicated concentrations of an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (PYR-41) for 24 h prior to recording. CFTR activity partially rescued by ubiquitin inhibitor. oocytes incubated with an inhibitor of the E1 ubiquitin pathway (PYR-41). CFTR-injected oocytes coinjected with M2-wt with PYR-41 for 24 h. hek-293 CFTR-wt cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or M2 and GFP. CFTR activity was confirmed by perfusion with forskolin. CFTR inhibitors GlyH-101 (20 M) and PPQ-102-inhibited current in HEK-transfected cells (black squares, n = 24) and forskolin-stimulated current in M2-wt GFP-transfected cells (gray diamonds n = 11). CFTR activity and trafficking are necessary for the inhibition of CFTR activity in HEK-293. the role of M2 ion channel and trafficking in CFTR inhibition in HEK-293 CFTR-wt cells. current-voltage plots of baseline currents of cells perfused with recording solution at neutral pH. 16HBE14o cells were transfected with either GFP or M2 GFP. both basal currents and inhibitor-sensitive CFTR conductance decreased in 16HBE14o. inhibitor-sensitive current was obtained by subtracting remaining current after the addition of specific CFTR inhibitors from forskolin, IBMX-activated, DIDS-inhibited current. CFTR-specific current was measured by perfusion with specific CFTR inhibitors GlyH-101 (20 M) and PPQ-102 (10 M) (INH) whole cell CFTR inhibitor-sensitive conductance in 16HBE14o cells transfected with M2-wt GFP, M2-wt, or M2-ER (n = 6, 15, 5). all values are means 1 SE. **P 0.01, significantly different from water-injected control by Student's t-test. coexpression of CFTR with influenza M2 decreased the GlyH-101-sensitive current in a dose-dependent manner. oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding CFTR and coinjected 24 h later with either cRNA encoding CFTR or vehicle (H2O) current-voltage plots of baseline currents of oocytes perfused with recording solution at neutral pH (7.6) (black triangles), pH 5.5 (gray inverted triangles), or pH 5.5 plus amantadine (100 M) (open triangles) (n = 17) oocytes were coinjected with water or varying concentrations of M2 as indicated. oocytes coinjected with M2 had decreased expression of mature, fully glycosylated CFTR protein (Fig. 1E) this effect was not due to a decrease in total protein expression since CFTR band B expression was actually increased. Xenopus oocytes were coinjected with CFTR and 24 h later with either water or varying concentrations of M2. current was activated by the removal of divalent cations and inhibited by the calcium channel blocker lanthanum. M GSH ester rescued amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes. it did not prevent the inhibition of CFTR activity. incubation of CFTR-injected oocytes with the SOD/catalase mimetic mimetic mimetic EUK-134 (100 M) (4) prior to M2 injection did not mitigate the decrease of CFTR current. incubation with 500 M amantadine 1 h after M2 injection rescued CFTR activity and the expression of fully glycosylated CFTR protein. oocytes with cRNAs encoding M2 with decreased ability to transport H+ (M2-G34V and M2-V27F) oocytes injected with M2-V27F showed little or no current respectively. two hours post-CFTR injection oocytes were incubated in either vehicle, 250 M amantadine (AMA) or 500 M amantadine. whole cell currents were recorded at 72 h post-CFTR injection. pH-induced currents were calculated by subtracting current during pH 7.6 perfusion from current when perfused at pH 5.5. oocytes were coinjected with either water (n = 119), M2 (n = 110) M2-G34V (n = 77) or M2-V27F (n = 12) twenty-four hours post-CFTR injection, various concentrations of NH4Cl and concanamycin A were added to the incubation media. seventy-two hours after CFTR injection, whole oocyte currents were recorded. oocytes were incubated with vehicle or indicated concentrations of an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (PYR-41) for 24 h prior to recording. oocytes were incubated with vehicle or indicated concentrations of an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (PYR-41) for 24 h prior to recording. oocytes coinjected with M2-wt had significantly less band C protein than water-coinjected oocytes. higher levels of CFTR (as compared with M2) were seen in oocytes injected with G34V. the differences were not statistically significant. we regularly achieved transfection efficiencies of 70\u201380%. CFTR was activated by the addition of forskolin and IBMX. CFTR inhibited by the addition of CFTR-specific inhibitors. CFTR activity was confirmed by perfusion with forskolin, IBMX, and specific CFTR inhibitors. CFTR activity was confirmed by perfusion with forskolin, IBMX, and specific CFTR inhibitors. M2 but not M2-G34V inhibited CFTR activity in HEK-293 CFTR-wt cells. we transfected HEK-293 CFTR-wt cells with ER-retained M2 (M2-ER GFP) no pH-induced M2-ER activity was observed. HEK-293 CFTR-wt cells transfected with M2 GFP and M2-ER GFP 48 h posttransfection. total cell currents obtained from GFP-expressing cells between 1 and 8 h after seeding. CFTR-specific current was only minimally inhibited by forskolin and IBMX. both basal currents and inhibitor-sensitive CFTR conductance decreased. 16HBE14o cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid. CFTR and M2 coinjected oocytes had similar morphology to water-injected oocytes. CFTR and M2 coinjected oocytes had a similar morphology to water-injected oocytes. oocytes coinjected with ND96 had significantly less forskolin-stimulated activity than water-coinjected control oocytes. inhibition was more effective at positive membrane potentials as previously demonstrated. oocytes were perfused with recording solution at neutral pH (7.6). then perfused with 10 M forskolin and 100 M IBMX (FORSK) to activate CFTR. CFTR current was confirmed by perfusion with ND96 pH 7.6. itometry of oocytes coinjected with CFTR and water. values were normalized to CFTR+H2O-injected controls. results suggest that M2 causes a defect in CFTR maturation. Xenopus oocytes were injected with a cRNA encoding the calcium channel, TRPV5. we measured currents in the presence and absence of various concentrations of injected M2 cRNA. M2 protein did not have a general inhibitory effect on ion channel expression in oocytes. the M2 inhibition of CFTR is not dependent on generation of reactive intermediates. ROS have been reported to either enhance (13) or inhibit (8, 10) native CFTR expression and activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. to determine the region of M2 essential for CFTR inhibition by M2, we incubated oocytes with the M2 ion channel inhibitor amantadine (41) this construct inhibited CFTR activity to the same extent as M2. oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding M2 with decreased ability to transport H+. M2-V27F also inhibited CFTR activity to a much lesser extent than the wild-type M2. to ascertain the role of M2 ion channel activity on the inhibition of ENaC, we coinjected oocytes with ENaC and M2-G34V. oocytes were coinjected with CFTR and either water (n = 119), M2 (n = 110) M2-G34V (n = 77), or M2-V27F (n = 12). oocytes were coinjected with cRNAs encoding epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) Influenza M2 protein is known to raise the pH of the secretory pathway during transit to the plasma membrane. CFTR-injected oocytes with either ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (3) or concanamycin A (18) decreased CFTR activity in a dose-dependent manner. a previously characterized M2 mutant containing a dilysine sequence causes the protein to be retained in the ER (M2-ER) it produced a higher amount protein than the wild-type construct but did not reach the plasma membrane. oocytes coinjected with CFTR did not show any loss of CFTR activity. oocytes were incubated with vehicle or indicated concentrations of an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (PYR-41) for 24 h prior to recording (n = 19, 21, 8, 11, 6, 11, 12, 12). oocytes coinjected with CFTR had significantly less band C protein than water-coinjected oocytes. CFTR-injected oocytes coinjected with M2-wt with PYR-41 for 24 h partially rescued CFTR activity in a dose-dependent manner. influenza M2 protein expression decreases CFTR activity in HEK-293 stably expressing CFTR. HEK-293 cells stably expressing CFTR were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or M2 and GFP. cells were patched in whole cell mode. inhibitor-sensitive current was calculated by subtracting remaining current after the addition of specific CFTR inhibitors. whole cell CFTR inhibitor-sensitive conductance (Ginhibitor) 24 and 48 h posttransfection with GFP or M2-wt GFP (n = 11, 12, 24, 11). all values are means 1 SE. **P 0.01, ***P 0.001, significantly different from water-injected control by Student's t-test. plots of baseline currents of cells perfused with recording solution at neutral pH (black triangles, n = 6) M2 (pH 7.4) and with a pH 5.5 recording solution (gray inverted triangles, n = 6) M2 (5.5) ion channel activity of M2-G34V-transfected cells was measured in cells perfused with pH 5.5 recording solution. 16HBE14o exhibited a large basal current that was not additionally stimulated by forskolin and IBMX. both basal currents and inhibitor-sensitive CFTR conductance decreased in 16HBE14o transfected with M2-wt GFP. inhibitor-sensitive conductance is the mean value of inhibitor-sensitive current divided by the applied voltage. CFTR-specific current was measured by perfusion with forskolin, IBMX, and specific CFTR inhibitors. Xenopus oocytes injected with human CFTR with the H+ ionophore CCCP resulted in only 20% loss of CFTR at pH 5.5 (27) acidic pH either potentiated or resulted in a small decrease in CFTR single channel activity (also 20%) of inside-out patches in epithelial cells stably transfected with CFTR (11) the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) channel unidirectionally conducts H+ out of the acidified organelles, increasing their pH. increased secretory pH mediated by M2 have been shown to alter glycosylation patterns, slow protein trafficking, and decrease plasma membrane protein recycling. influenza M2 has a destabilizing effect on CFTR protein. this leads to an accumulation of immaturely glycosylated band B protein in M2-transfected cells. this may cause the channel to be targeted for degradation via ubiquitination. studies suggest that CFTR is modified by ROS (8, 10), it is possible that M2-induced ROS did not reach sufficient levels to alter CFTR activity. other studies have examined the effect of influenza on ion transport in the lung. influenza M2 protein expression inhibits CFTR activity by modifying the pH of the secretory pathway at the cellular level. nitric oxide has also been shown to directly alter CFTR activity (8, 12, 13, 25) TRIBUTIONS J.D.L., A.L., A.J., J.F.C., J.W.N., and S.M. conception and design of research; J.D.L. and A.L. performed experiments; J.D.L. and A.L. analyzed data; J.D.L. prepared figures; J.D.L. and S.M. drafted manuscript; J.D.L., A.L., A"}
