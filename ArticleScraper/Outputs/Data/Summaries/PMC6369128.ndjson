{"summary": "the aim of the present study was to develop a serodiagnostic test for differentiation infected from vaccinated animal (DIVA) strategy. the test allowed discrimination of NDV infected sera from epitope deletion virus vaccinated sera. rERP ELISA was a promising DIVA diagnostic tool. nt trailer flanks six essential genes encoding nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and large polymerase protein (L) nt trailer at its 5\u2032 end flanking six essential genes encoding nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein was expressed in baculovirus system. specificity and sensitivity of recombinant protein was evaluated. synthetic gene and tertiary structure prediction was synthesized commercially. recombinant baculovirus cells were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA. the transfection solution was removed and 2 mL supplemented with 10% FBS. recombinant baculovirus production was monitored daily by visualization. protein expression and purification SF9 suspension cultures (2106 cells/mL) grown in 2 L of Sf900 II medium supplemented with 1% of FBS were infected with recombinant baculovirus. cells were grown for 72 hours and cell pellets were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) rERP was dialyzed against refolding buffer (40 mM CHAPS and 10 mM DTT) electrophoresis and Western blotting Proteins extracted from infected Sf9 cells were fractionated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) at room temperature for 1 hour. dilutions that gave the optimum difference in absorbance at 450 nm were selected to test the sera panel. the working dilution of goat anti-chicken HRP-IgG, the reaction temperature, time and other conditions also were optimized. each sample was repeated in triplicate wells and the mean value was calculated. all sera were tested serologically positive by a HI test using NDV antigen. plates were washed three times with PBST and blocked with 150 L per well PBST. synthetic gene cloned in vector backbone PMK-RQ (KanR) was received as 5 g of lyophilized plasmid preparation. recombinant bacmid Synthetic gene was subcloned into pFastBac HT b vector. transfected Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA. recombinant baculovirus was passed three times by infecting more Sf9 cells. cell pellets were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) recombinant ERP (rERP) carried 6 His tag at N-terminal. cells were lysed in 10 mL buffer B (10 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0) and centrifuged the lysate at 10,000g for 30 minutes. the separated proteins were blotted onto an immuno-Blot polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 hour. after washing 3 times with PBST, the blocked membrane was incubated with NDV chicken antiserum for 1 hour. dilution of goat anti-chicken HRP-IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to determine a cutoff value. the mean negative serum optical density (OD) value plus three standard deviations was used as the cutoff value. each sample was repeated in triplicate wells. 1 g/mL rERP protein in 50 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed three times with PBST and blocked with 150 L per well PBST with 5% skim milk powder solution at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. baculovirus containing the recombined ERP gene insert (bac-rERP) was generated by transposition of recombinant vector into the SF9 cells by transfection. the codon optimized gene was commercially synthesized from GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector. alignment of obtained nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the rERP gene insert revealed 100% match with bac-rERP infected cells were lysed under denaturing conditions. the protein was allowed to refold using refolding buffer. the protein was analyzed by western blot assay. cutoff value, reactivity of rERP with chicken anti-AIV, anti-IBV, anti-IBDV, and normal sera was measured. minimum dilution titer of chicken anti-NDV serum detected was 1:1,600 according to cutoff value of 0.232. box-and-whisker plot of absorbance values of indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in three different groups. whiskers denote ranges. Triangle represents mean values. all data points from 4 independent experiments of sample size n=10 in each group are plotted. ERP protein suggests IDE reactive antibodies would be freely accessible to epitopes separated by tetra-glycine linkers in tertiary dimensional space. expression, purification, and characterization of rERP Bac-to-Bac expression system was used to produce a baculovirus encoding N-terminally 6 His tagged rERP protein. rERP protein, lane P, positive control (cell culture fluid); lane N1, negative control (cell culture fluid); lane N2, negative control (phosphate buffered saline); protein marker. optimal concentration of the rERP (1 g/mL) and dilution rate of sera (1:400) were determined. es denote interquartile ranges, with median values shown as horizontal lines inside the box. whiskers denote ranges. Individual data points are plotted. subunit vaccines using F and HN protein [21] can serve as marker vaccines but are less effective than whole virus vaccines [22]. this necessitates NDV marker vaccine based on chimeric live virus. in preliminary study, chickens were immunized with viable recombinant NDV lacking this IDE with reverse genetics technique. rERP was recognized by chicken anti-NDV serum with a specific band at approximately 20 kDa. no specific band was observed when using negative control serum. rERP could react specifically with anti-NDV serum."}
