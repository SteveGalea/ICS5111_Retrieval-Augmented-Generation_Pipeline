{"summary": "ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes. the CE clan has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. elaD is distantly related to eukaryotic CE clan members. a large family of eukaryotic cysteine proteases is involved in generation of ubiquitin(-like) proteins from their precursors. pathogens can tamper with the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cripple the cell's defenses. eukaryotic cysteine proteases are expressed by viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. bacterial deubiquitinases include a protease that is secreted into host cells by Y. pestis [17], and homologs to this peptidase can be found in other bacteria, too [18], [19]. in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggest that these proteins are indeed proteases with specificity for ubiquitin or SUMO. we used PHI-BLAST [24] to find proteins with the typical catalytic triad of histidine, aspartate (or glutamate or asparagine) and the active-site cysteine. we excluded proteins without the hallmark oxyanion-stabilizing group, consisting of at least one glutamine (or asparagine) close to the active-site cysteine. phylogram trees tend to correctly predict to which functional class a particular ULP/SENP homolog belongs. bootstrap support is generally not significant. eukaryotic peptidases (in blue) belong to the C48 subfamily. we were particularly interested in the protein elaD (belonging to \u201cgroup II\u201d, see Figure 1), expressed by E. coli and with orthologs in Legionella pneumophila and in all currently sequenced strains of Salmonella. elaD represents one of the more distantly related hits in our bioinformatics screen. arrows indicate active-site histidine, aspartate (or asparagine), the catalytic cysteine, and the oxyanion-stabilizing group. goal of first experiment was to confirm protease activity and to determine substrate specificity of elaD. elaD readily forms a covalent adduct with the ubiquitin probe. biochemical assay for substrate specificity of elaD. 35S-methionine-labeled in vitro translated wildtype elaD forms covalent adducts with suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and Nedd8. all probes were tested for activity with bona fide substrates. deubiquitinase was compared to the rapid Isopeptidase T with a rate of ca. 8 per minute [39] or to the much slower ubiquitin-protease USP14 with a rate of 0.01 per minute. similar observations have been made with the SARS virus deubiquitinase [8]. depicted is a representative experiment in which variable concentrations of purified elaD were incubated with 500 nM ubiquitin-AMC for 40 min. the wildtype elaD can be inhibited by alkylation of its active-site cysteine with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide. the y-axis represents the time scale with measurements every 2 minutes. G. zeae ortholog displays dual activity towards Nedd8 and ubiquitin. ubiquitin-specificity is not restricted to bacterial or viral CE peptidases. this result indicates that ubiquitin-specificity exists in some ancient eukaryotic members of this protease clan. ubiquitin-AMC and Nedd8-AMC hydrolyze both substrates. human SENP8 only cleaves Nedd8-AMC. hydrolysis is sensitive to NEM treatment. the y-axis depicts relative fluorescence. we have extended our analysis of elaD's specificity to the ubiquitin homologs Nedd8 and ISG15. both share significant sequence similarity to ubiquitin, and the binding of elaD to Nedd8-vinylsulfone was significantly weaker than to the ubiquitin probe. elaD is present in the commensal E. coli strain K12, and in all intestinal pathogenic strains (EAEC, EHEC, EIEC, EPEC, ETEC) the gene is absent in APEC, NMEC, and two uropathogenic strains, and encoded as a pseudogene in three other strains. APEC, NMEC, and UPEC belong to the group of extraintestinal pathogenic strains. the fact that all CE proteases show the same signature motifs at the catalytic domain and have substrate specificity for ubiquitin, Ubls, or related products. lateral gene transfer has been proposed between eukaryotes and dsDNA viruses. the dual specificity of SENP8 from the fungus G. zeae towards ubiquitin and Nedd8 is not trivial. there are sequence differences that require distinct conjugating machineries and deconjugating proteases. the recognition of both ubiquitin and Nedd8 is in contrast to what has been observed in mammalian SENP8 [27] logenetic analysis Protein and DNA sequence data were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org), and the University of Wisconsin E. coli Genome Project.
