{"summary": "membrane fusion is driven by large conformational changes in surface viral fusion (F) proteins. the paramyxovirus F protein is a prototypic class I fusion protein. it is synthesized in the secretory pathway, trafficked to the plasma membrane, endocytosed for cleavage and trafficked back to the cell surface. soluble HIV gp41 trimers, another class I fusion protein, could only be produced when foldon was added to the protein (4). changes in length or single point mutations in the TM domain can result in modulation of viral fusion protein activity and function. a heptad repeat leucine-isoleucine zipper (LIZ) was found in-frame with the upstream leucine zipper in the heptad repeat B domain. studies have previously shown that a LIZ motif can promote protein oligomerization in soluble proteins and more recently in hydrophobic environments. the sequences of 140 paramyxovirus F proteins were analyzed for amino acid frequency in the predicted TM domain. the predicted TM domains were aligned to look for a specific pattern related to a leucine-isoleucine zipper. a site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the four L/I residues (Leu-488 + Ile-495 + Ile-502 + Leu-509) with alanine resulting in a four point mutant, the data for the chimeric WT protein fit with a monomer-trimer equilibrium curve. additional curve fits were analyzed, such as a single species monomer. the oligomeric state of the second species for both WT and LIZ 4A was found to be trimeric. sedimentation equilibrium analysis revealed a shift in monomer-trimer equilibrium for LIZ 4A SN-TM. samples were prepared in detergent micelles, and the absorbance data were collected at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. a new tab Mutation of the TM domain L/I zipper alters overall protein expression and fusion activity. the LIZ 4A mutant protein was analyzed for total and surface expression by cell surface biotinylation. a reduction in protein expression of LIZ 4A F at the cell surface was also observed. the single point mutants L488A, I495A, and I502A showed a moderate to WT level fusion index. each of the single point mutants displayed a large reduction in total and cell surface protein expression levels. a small shift in molecular weight for the LIZ 4A and L509A constructs was observed. total and surface expression levels for LIZ 4A F were reduced. total protein (A) and surface (white bars) expression levels of transiently transfected F constructs were normalized to WT levels. a pulse-chase experiment was performed with various time points analyzed up to 24 h post-transfection. the F protein was detected as the inactive uncleaved form, Fo. expression levels increased from the 0-h time point, suggesting proper trafficking. a pulse-chase experiment was performed to monitor WT F or LIZ 4A F protein expression and processing. the protein was less stable over time than the WT F. this could explain the reduction in LIZ 4A F detection. the cells expressing the F protein were either maintained at 37 \u00b0C or exposed to an elevated temperature of 55 \u00b0C for a brief period. after heat exposure, the cells were quickly cooled to prevent further conformational changes and incubated with an antibody, mAb 5B3, that was specific to the pre-fusion conformation of HeV F. the cells were then lysed and processed to determine the amount of F protein in the pre-fusion conformation. thermal triggering was performed at 55 \u00b0C for both constructs. quantification was determined via band densitometry. results represent three independent experiments. site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace four L/I residues with alanine resulting in a four point mutant, LIZ 4A. chimeric proteins containing staphylococcal nuclease (SN) protein linked to the TM domain of interest and analytical ultracentrifugation were brought to sedimentation equilibrium in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. an absorbance-based apparent dissociation constant was calculated for WT and LIZ 4A. when normalized to WT at each spin speed, the LIZ 4A mutant displayed an approximately 1000-fold decrease in association constant. these results implicate the predicted L/I zipper motif in TM-TM association for the HeV F TM domain. the relative apparent association constant (Ka) is normalized to the WT SN-TM construct for each spin. 20,000 rpm 25,000 rpm 30,000 rpm WT LIZ 4A. the single point mutants L488A, I495A, I502A, and L509A were examined to determine the effect each had on the F protein. the single point mutants L488A, I495A, and I502A showed a moderate reduction in total protein expression levels compared with the WT F protein. L509A had more fusogenically active F than the LIZ 4A mutant. this would enable L509A to drive fusion, unlike LIZ 4A mutant. changes in TM-TM interactions may affect the glycosylation state or glycosylation modification of this upstream residue. the mutation completely abolished F-mediated fusion activity. a pulse-chase experiment was performed with various time points analyzed up to 24 h post-transfection. the mutation was detected as the inactive uncleaved form, Fo. the F protein was detected in both the uncleaved and cleaved forms. the initial level of LIZ 4A F protein expression at the early time points were comparable with that of WT, but quickly protein levels began to diminish over the later time points. the average represents three independent experiments standard deviation. the student's t test was used to determine significance between WT F and LIZ 4A time points. LIZ 4A F triggered more readily than WT F at 55 \u00b0C. TM-TM association may contribute to pre-fusion stability of the F protein. triggered more readily than WT F at 55 \u00b0C. peptides that prevent conformational changes can be used as a therapeutic treatment. maintenance of the pre-fusion state of the F protein is necessary until the F protein is in the appropriate location to drive membrane fusion. asles virus F protein was found to modulate fusion activity by altering F protein interaction with its receptor binding protein, hemagglutinin (10). these studies further support the importance of the TM domain in F protein function and suggest that TM-TM interactions are important for proper F protein function. TM-TM interactions are important for stability of the F protein in its pre-fusion conformation. the results suggest that shifting the TM-TM interactions toward a monomeric state dramatically destabilized the pre-fusion conformation of the F protein. TM-TM interactions serve to pin the F protein in its pre-fusion conformation. a recent report found targeting the ErbB TM domain with TM domain-derived peptides could delay tumor growth. the -amyloid peptide, which helps mediate plaques typical of Alzheimer's disease lesions, was found to contain critical TM domain residues that contribute to -amyloid peptide oligomerization (47). constructs containing either the wild-type or mutant Hendra F TM domain were cloned into pET11a using XmaI and XhoI sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. anti-peptide antibodies to residues 527\u2013539 of the Hendra F cytoplasmic tail were used to pull down F. sequences of 140 paramyxovirus F proteins were aligned and analyzed. first, the TM domains were predicted with the TMHMM Server v 2.0 (51). the frequency of branched amino acids was calculated at each position in the aligned TM domain region and graphed. the cells were labeled for 3 h with DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine. the cells were then washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. surface proteins were biotinylated using 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NSH-Biotin. ten microliters of the supernatant was removed to analyze the protein population. the samples were boiled for 10 min, removed to a new tube, and repeated with 40 l of 10% SDS for a total of 100 l. all constructs were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 2 yeast extract-tryptone medium. the cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.6\u20130.8, induced for protein expression by addition of 1 mm isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) the cells were resuspended in a 1:20 culture volume of lysis buffer. the recombinant protein was purified by FPLC cation exchange chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) the supernatant was then dialyzed overnight at 4 \u00b0C against lysis buffer containing 0.1 m NH4OAc and 0.2% (v/v) Thesit and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min. molecular mass (Mm) and partial specific volume (v) of the monomer in solution and the molecular mass for a monomer/trimer (m/t) as a multiple of Mm were estimated using SEDNTERP. the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 5 g/ml mAb 5B3 in PBS + 1% BSA for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C to detect pre-fusion Hendra F. the results were reported as follows. all mutants were made in pGEM using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) SN fused to the TM domain of glycophorin A in the pET-11a expression vector was generously provided by Karen Fleming (Johns Hopkins University) to generate the constructs described here (50) the membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (light chain specific) secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000. the membranes were visualized with the bio-Rad ChemiDoc system. sequences of 140 paramyxovirus F proteins were aligned and analyzed. surface biotinylation Vero cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (4 g of DNA wild-type or mutant pCAGGS-Hendra F) the cells were washed with PBS and starved for 45 min in DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine. the cells were then labeled for 3 h with DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine. the beads were washed twice with RIPA + 0.30 m NaCl, twice with RIPA + 0.15 m NaCl, and once with SDS wash II (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA) the samples were boiled for 10 min, removed to a new tube, and repeated with 40 l of 10% SDS for a total of 100 l. the cells were labeled for 30 min with Trans[35S] metabolic label (100 Ci/ml; MP Biomedicals) at appropriate time points, the cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer. the recombinant protein was purified by FPLC cation exchange chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) and then exchanged into a solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7), 29% D2O, and Zwittergent detergent 3-(N,N-dimethylmyristyl-ammonio)propanesulfonate protein concentrations corresponding to 280-nm absorbance between 0.4 and 0.8 were used. best fit model was chosen by examining residual distribution of approximately 0, the correlation constant (R), and 2 values. mm dishes were transfected with 4 g of either wild-type or mutant Hendra F in pCAGGS using Lipofectamine and Plus (Invitrogen) the cells were washed and replenished with DMEM + FBS at 37 \u00b0C, or at 50 \u00b0C. after heat treatment, the samples were immediately placed on ice. author contributions S.
