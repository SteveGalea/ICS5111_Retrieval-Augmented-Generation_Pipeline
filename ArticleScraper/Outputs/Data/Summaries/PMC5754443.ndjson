{"summary": "case 1 A 41-year-old woman with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease was admitted to the intensive care unit with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. a chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates, and a mini\u2013bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed. nine hours after lavage, we identified a 3,217 base-pair sequence of DNA that was well aligned (E 10199) with published genomes of resistance genes accurately predicted the phenotypic resistance pattern identified by the clinical microbiology laboratory using conventional susceptibility testing. we amplified the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from DNA isolated from the lavage fluid and performed community sequencing using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego) this revealed a low-diversity bacterial community dominated (65% relative abundance) by P. aeruginosa. lavage fluid using community sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene confirmed the presence of a low-diversity bacterial community dominated by P. aeruginosa. real-time sequencing using the MinION revealed six high-quality DNA sequence reads measuring between 909 and 8,288 base pairs. a real-time metagenomic approach is capable of identifying RNA viruses in nonlung specimens (5, 6), demonstrating its potential for an impressive breadth of taxonomic detection. a real-time metagenomic approach may prove to be a powerful tool both in the detection of known pathogens as well as in identification of emerging diseases. clinical study is warranted as the revolution in molecular microbiology has at last reached the bedside."}
