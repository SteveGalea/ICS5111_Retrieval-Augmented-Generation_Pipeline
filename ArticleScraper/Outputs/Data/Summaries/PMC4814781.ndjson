{"summary": "application of NAATs PCR is accepted as a rapid diagnostic test. sensitivity of NAATs is almost always superior to that of traditional procedures. sensitivity of NAATs is almost always superior to that of traditional procedures. multiplex assays are somewhat less sensitive than monoplex assays. but until the number of organisms present in clinical specimens of diseased individuals is known, it is impossible to state whether the degree of sensitivity attained is clinically acceptable. the expanded panel detects now a total of 17 viruses and three bacteria. the test requires 5 min hands-on-time and 65 min instrumentation time. in 2013, a new version of the filmarray was released. Sensitivity and specificity were 70.0 and 100%, respectively, for the RespiFinder assay and 80.0 and 98.73% for the Seegene assay. dumke et al. compared four commercially available real-time PCR assays recommended for use with the Roche LightCycler 1.5 and 2.0 instruments.

(2015) examined specimens from 2222 hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia and 521 asymptomatic controls. M. pneumoniae was detected in 8%, and in 3% or less of controls. another trend is the simultaneous detection of M. pneumoniae and mutations associated with macrolide resistance directly in clinical specimens. a low IgM specificity and cross-reactivity was noticed for the SeroMP recombinant and Liaison assay. for IgA, the Medac assay tended to be less specific than the SeroMP Recombinant assay. all four tests showed discrepancies in the IgG measurements confirming results of previous studies.
