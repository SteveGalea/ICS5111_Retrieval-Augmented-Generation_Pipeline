{"summary": "a total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart 22 kit and the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system. results At least one pathogen was detected in 612 (72.4%) of the specimens. the most commonly detected pathogens were influenza A virus (IFV-A) (n = 219), influenza B virus (IFV-B) (n = 157), rhinovirus/enter acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. the mortality rate is higher in children under five years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (1, 2). the most common causative agents of ARTIs are viruses. a total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from patients with a clinical pre-diagnosis of ARTI between September 1, 2014 and august 31, 2015. each sample was simultaneously tested for the following 22 pathogens: IFV-A, IFV-A, IFV-A, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV-B, HMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus. a total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 309 children and 536 adults with ARTI were analyzed. the median age was 29 years (range 0 - 91 years); 444 (52.5%) of the patients were male and 401 (47.5%) were female. positive detection rate in male patients was found to be higher than in adults. IFV-A (n = 219) was the most commonly detected pathogen (Table 2). 99 (91%) of the IFV-A viruses were viruses and 81 (9%) were bacteria. human metapneumovirus 11 (3.5) 25 (5) 36 (4.4) Total 317 (100) 504 (100) 821 (100) aValues are expressed as No. (%). 4.2. Age-related Prevalence of Respiratory Viruses. in the 65-year-old subgroup, the most commonly detected viruses were IFV-A (n = 47), IFV-B (n = 33), RV/EV (n = 22), HBoV (n = 19), HMPV (n = 12), HCoV (n = 9), HCoV (n = 6), PIVs (n = 6), and RSV A/B (n = 5), respectively.

IFVs can have different clinical manifestations from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia resulting in death. RV and EV are both members of the enterovirus genus. RV is now considered to be a major cause of lower ARTIs and asthmatic exacerbations. MPV, HBoV, HMPV, RV/EV, and HCoVs were more frequently found in co-infections. the most commonly detected co-infections were IFV-A/HBoV and IFV-A/IFV-B. nasopharyngeal samples were suggested to reveal reliable results. IFV-B was not detected in the autumn months or in December; it began to appear in January. in contrast, IFV-A was seen throughout the year, with peak activity in March and April. differences in peak periods, compared to previous reports, could be explained by smaller number of cases in our study. in our region, respiratory viruses were generally active in the early spring and winter. peak months for these agents were different from each other over a one-year period. early detection and monitoring of respiratory pathogens is essential."}
