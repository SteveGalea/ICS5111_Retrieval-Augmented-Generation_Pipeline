{"summary": "flies were kept on standard cornmeal\u2013agar medium at 25\u00b0. all fly lines were tested for Wolbachia infection and cured whenever necessary. libraries were depleted from 2S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (wickersheim and Blumenstiel 2013) libraries were reheated for 2 min at 70\u00b0 and placed on ice. libraries were sequenced in Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) with a single-end 50 bp read-length strategy. cells were sorted into mCherry-/GFP-, mCherry+/GFP+ and mCherry+/GFP+ populations in 0.5 ml of OSS cell medium. FACS analysis and cell sorting was done on the FACS Aria II or FACS Aria Fusion (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), configured to detect DAPI, GFP and mCherry according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions. library quality was assessed in Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) libraries were sequenced in Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) reads were mapped using STAR v2.5.2b (Dobin et al. 2013) to a modified Drosophila genome and annotation. immunohistochemistry For immunostaining, samples were blocked for 30 min in PBTX+1% BSA. primary antibodies, diluted in PBTX+1% BSA incubated overnight at 4\u00b0. fixed ovaries were incubated with Stellaris Wash Buffer A for 5 min. hybridized with probes (125 nM) in Stellaris Hybridization Buffer in the dark at 37\u00b0 overnight. images were taken on a Leica LSM700 or 780 confocal microscope. reads are normalized to total reads, excluding microRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. total RNAseq (NuGEN) was done on sorted FSCs of tj-Gal4,UAS-mCherry::NLS; UAS-FHVB2eGFP,UAS-CrPV-1A flies. heatmap of the 35 differentially expressed genes between restrictive and permissive FSCs. small RNA sequencing Ovaries (20 pairs) from 3-4 days old flies were dissected. RNA extraction from Trizol stored ovaries was done following manufacturers\u2019 instructions. libraries for small RNA sequencing were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA library preparation kit. reads were mapped sequentially using bowtie v1.1.2 (Langmead et al. 2009) to the following references. rRNA\u2019s, microRNA\u2019s, FHVB2eGFP, TEs and Drosophila genome (dm6), using piPipes v1.5.0 (Han et al. 2015), allowing 1 mismatch for all references except for the Drosophila genome (dm6) mCherry+/GFP- and mCherry+/GFP+ populations in 0.5 ml of OSS cell medium. FACS sorting was done at the Flow Cytometry platform. cells were centrifuged at 1000 X g for 5 min, resuspended in 0.4 ml of Trizol. erryNLS transgenes the transgenes added as extra chromosomes were counted using featureCounts v1.5.2. differential gene expression of transcripts present in 25% of the libraries with at least 5 reads across all libraries was done using DESeq2 v1.20. custom Stellaris FISH Probes were designed against the first 2600 nucleotides of the sense strand of FHV-RNA1 by utilizing the Stellaris RNA FISH Probe designer. the samples were incubated with Stellaris Wash Buffer A for 5 min and hybridized with probes (125 nM) in Stellaris Hybridization Buffer in the dark at 37\u00b0 overnight. raw sequencing data are available from the European Nucleotide Archives. the piRNA pathway is not involved in FHVB2eGFP control. reads are normalized to total reads, except microRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. replicon was placed under control of a minimal heat-shock promoter and yeast UASGal4 sequences. only two independent transgenic lines were obtained, probably reflecting the detrimental effects of the ectopic leaky expression of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. expression of the replicon in eyes using the GMR-Gal4 driver did not produce detectable GFP fluorescence. when the flies also expressed a small hairpin (sh) RNA targeting Ago2 (GMR-Gal4; UAS-FHVB2eGFP/UAS-shAgo2), a strong and homogeneous green fluorescence was observed in the eyes. fluorescence was consistently observed in restricted patches. mCherry expression could be seen in early stages of oogenesis. replicon-derived GFP expression was only observed after stage 10. tj-GAL4 driven expression of FHVB2eGFP in follicular somatic cells during oogenesis. tj-GAL4 driven expression of FHVB2eGFP in follicular somatic cells during oogenesis. fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) of the RNA1 of FHV. the piRNA pathway is not involved in replicon control in the majority of FSCs. the primary piRNA pathway is active in FSCs and is essential for the control of transposon replication in this tissue. s targeting TEs, such as gypsy, were present in the libraries. we consistently observed an accumulation of 21-nt long siRNAs for most transposons in Ago2 null mutant background. we conclude that only the siRNA pathway is activated by the replicon in FSCs. gene ontology (GO) analysis did not reveal enrichment in any functional category. the unknown gene CG13659, which was enriched by 16-fold in permissive cells, is induced upon systemic acute infection by FHV. the replicon is co-expressed with UAS-mCherry::NLS or in RNAi deficient background (UAS-shAgo2). the ubiquitous expression of RFP::Dicer2 controls the expression of FHVB2eGFP. in RNAi mutant flies, we observed GFP signal in the whole body in the absence of driver, reflecting baseline leaky expression amplified by the RdRP. this results indicate that the UAS-FHVB2eGFP replicon can be used to monitor the activity of antiviral RNA interference in vivo. the siRNA pathway is not required for partial control of FHVB2eGFP in follicular somatic cells of the Drosophila ovary. tj-GAL4 driven expression of FHVB2eGFP in follicular somatic cells during oogenesis. early to late stages of oogenesis are represented. a few scattered cells expressed higher levels of RNA, overlapping with GFP positive cells. dsRNA could only be detected in single isolated cells, falling within patches of GFP positive cells. the primary piRNA pathway is active in the FSCs. peak of 21nt small RNAs mapping in equal proportion to the (+) and (-) strands was not observed in libraries prepared from dcr2 null mutant flies. in dcr2 null mutant flies, expressing CrPV-1A, we noted a strong raise in the number of siRNAs. other targets of the siRNA pathway (hairpin RNAs or cis-natural antisense transcripts) showed the expected pattern of regulation in these sected the ovaries from flies expressing the replicon, CrPV-1A and a mCherryNLS reporter in FSCs. we sorted FSCs based on mCherry expression, further separating them into restrictive- (GFP-) and permissive- (GFP+) enriched pools. some of the DE transcripts could represent genes involved in a response of FSCs to viral infection. the decreased expression of these genes in the permissive pool could reflect alterations of mitochondrial metabolism or damage caused by replication of viral RNA. obligate endosymbionts are detected both in the FSCs and in the oocyte. the facultative endosymbiont Spiroplasma transits directly from the hemolymph to the oocyte bound to yolk proteins secreted by the fat body. a viral replicon can be controlled by at least two mechanisms in FSCs, the siRNA pathway and a novel restriction mechanism. most of the piRNAs produced in FSCs originate from piRNA clusters. flamenco mutants show high transposition rates of retrotransposons. follicle cells of these mutants produce viral like particles. this reveals the importance of piRNAs in FSCs for the control of transposons. a protein-based mechanism may be involved in the restriction of the FHV replicon. candidates may reflect a response to infection and the induction of an antiviral state. dIlp8 is secreted by imaginal discs upon damage. cell based knockdown and mutagenesis screens fail to capture complexity and signaling pathways present in tissues or organisms. in vivo screens with injected viruses are time consuming, bypass the natural route of infection for most viruses."}
