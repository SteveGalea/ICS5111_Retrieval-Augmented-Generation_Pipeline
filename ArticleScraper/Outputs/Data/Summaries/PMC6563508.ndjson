{"summary": "studies in the field of small, noncoding RNAs have advanced tremendously. RNAi acts, with variations, in all eukaryotes ranging from unicellular organisms to complex species from the plant and animal kingdoms. the key concept of all RNA silencing pathways is the association of single-stranded small RNAs of 20\u201330 nucleotides (nt) to a protein of the Argonaute superfamily. positive and negative-sense RNA viruses were recently proposed to be a substrate for the RNAi pathway in several mammalian cell culture and animal models. conflicting evidence has also emerged in several studies that failed to detect vsiRNAs [16,17,18,19]. in vertebrates, RNAi coincides with the dsRNA-activated protein-based interferon response. insects encode two Dicer genes, of which Dicer-1 mediates miRNA biogenesis, whereas Dicer-2 is responsible for siRNA biogenesis. mammals encode a single Dicer that generates both miRNAs and siRNAs. mammals encode four Argonaute genes, all of which engage in microRNA-guided gene silencing. the complementary strand (the passenger strand) is degraded in a process that requires Ago2 and the endonuclease Component 3 Promoter of RISC (C3PO) dicer-2 selects the opposite strand that will be loaded into Ago2 [34] the guide strand mediates target RNA recognition through Watson-Crick base pairing, followed by target cleavage (slicing) by Argonaute. dicer proteins process double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNA (siRNA) dsRNA with blunt termini are locally unwound, with one of the strand threading through the helicase domain in an ATP dependent manner. ago2-bound siRNAs recognize target RNAs via Watson-Crick base pairing. an exception is the first nucleotide of the siRNA, which is locked in a pocket of the Ago2 MID/PIWI domain. gene-pseudogene pairs and transposon insertions are potential sources of dsRNA when they express transcripts with full or partial complementarity. miRNA Pathway in Insects miRNAs are an endogenous class of small RNAs, expressed by plants, animals, protists and even viruses. pri-miRNAs are typically a few kb in length [59] and harbor either single or multiple local stem-loop structures. they are released from the pri-miRNA transcript in the nucleus by the microprocessor complex, consisting of the RNase-III enzyme Drosha and its co-factor Pasha [62,63,64,65,66] miRNAs in mammals are an abundant class of small RNAs of 21\u201322 nt in length [78] that are primarily produced from RNA polymerase II synthesized pri-miRNAs. pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved into miRNA duplexes. these duplexes are loaded by Dicer and its co-factors TRBP (TAR RNA binding protein) and PACT (Protein miRNAs are loaded into an Argonaute containing RISC complex. one of the strands is eliminated and degraded. the other strand is retained and used to guide Argonaute onto target RNAs. the other strand is retained and used to guide Argonaute onto target RNAs. the majority of mRNAs is estimated to be regulated by miRNAs [100], and post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is thus implicated in almost all cell biological processes. early evidence has already indicated that the siRNA pathway is functional in mammals. miRNA miR-451, implicated in regulation of erythroid development, is dicer-independent. inactivation of AGO2 by insertional mutagenesis in mice results in a lethal phenotype as only wild-type and heterozygous offspring are observed. biochemical evidence that slicing is required for the observed phenotypes is currently lacking. dsRNA cleaves it into 21 nt siRNA duplexes with characteristic two-nucleotide overhangs at the 3\u2019 ends of both strands. one of the two strands (the guide strand) is selectively incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with at its catalytic core the Argonaute-2 (Ago2) protein. the complementary strand (the passenger strand) is degraded in a the siRNA duplex is loaded into an Argonaute2 containing RISC complex. the guide strand mediates target RNA recognition through Watson-Crick base pairing, followed by target cleavage (slicing) by Argonaute. two models of substrate processing have been proposed for Dicer-2. substrates with 3\u2019 overhangs are cleaved distributively by Dicer-2. dsRNA with blunt termini are locally unwound, with one of the strand threading through the helicase domain in an ATP dependent manner. gene-pseudogene pairs and transposon insertions are potential sources of dsRNA when they express transcripts with full or partial complementarity. dsRNA is usually not abundant in healthy, uninfected cells and the major function of this pathway seems to be defense against foreign dsRNA of viral origin. miRNAs are processed from genome-encoded hairpins called primary-miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and, less frequently, by RNA polymerase III. pri-miRNAs harbor either single or multiple local stem-loop structures that undergo a series of maturation steps to generate an Argonaute-associated miRNA. miRNAs in mammals are an abundant class of small RNAs of 21\u201322 nt in length [78] that are produced from RNA polymerase II synthesized pri-miRNAs. these pri-miRNAs are processed into pre-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex, consisting of the RNaseIII Drosha along with DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome Critical Region 8) [79] a single Dicer protein processes long dsRNA into siRNAs and pre-miRNAs into miRNA duplexes. the other strand is retained and used to guide Argonaute onto target RNAs, resulting in cleavage (siRNA) or translational inhibition or target RNA destabilization (miRNA) miRNA-mediated gene regulation seems to be the dominant function of mammalian RNAi. early evidence has already indicated that the siRNA pathway is functional in mammals. dsRNA was reported to be functional in gene knockdown in embryonal teratocarcinoma cell lines that are interferon defective. target cleavage occurs between nucleotide ten and eleven, counted from the 5\u2019 end of the siRNA. evolutionary conservation of AGO2-mediated target cleavage in mammals suggests important functions for this activity. miRNA-mediated gene silencing in AGO1, AGO3, and AGO4 deficient embryonic stem cells was comparable to control cells. cytokines with strong antiviral activity signal in an autocrine and paracrine fashion via the interferon-/ receptor (IFNAR), consisting of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 [110,111,112] Upon binding of type I IFNs, IFNAR activates the JAK-STAT pathway to induce expression of hundreds of Interferon stimulated genes. Upon detection of foreign nucleic acids, the CARD domains transduce the signal to mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) located at mitochondrial membranes, leading to the phosphorylation and activation interferon response factors (IRF) 3 and 7. Upon activation, IRF3 and IRF7 form homodimers and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind Interferon-Stimulated Response Elements (ISRE) to activate dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR; also known as eIF2AK2), 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (ADAR1) and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1. dsRNA activates OAS1, which synthesizes 2\u2019-5\u2019 oligomers of adenosine (2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylate) [120 RLR receptors are DExD/H-box helicases, where DExD/H refers to Asp-Glu-x-Asp/His. the conserved helicase core of RLRs, consisting of two highly similar tandem helicase domains (Hel1 and Hel2) separated by a unique insertion (Hel2i), is critical for the integration of signals triggered upon RNA binding. mice deficient in LGP2 have altered CD8+ T cell responses to rabies virus, influenza A virus and west Nile virus infections. rIG-I binding to the 5\u2019- region of the pre-genomic RNA of hepatitis B virus counteracts the interaction with the viral polymerase (P), resulting in suppression of viral replication. the IFN response is severely attenuated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [145], and is regulated at multiple levels in human ESCs. pathogen recognition receptors including the dsRNA sensor and signaling molecules OAS1, MDA5 and TLR3 are downregulated in human ESCs. a recent study showed that suppression of the IFN response in mESCs depends on miRNA mediated silencing of MAVS. ESCs have been found to possess an active RNAi response. the interferon system exerts strong adaptive pressure on viruses. the influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a well-known IFN antagonist that inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear import of IRF-3. innate immune system distinguishes self from non-self based on molecular patterns. innate immune system distinguishes self from non-self based on molecular patterns. different receptors have been identified that recognize foreign nucleic acids. dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR; also known as eIF2AK2), 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (ADAR1) and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1. dsRNA activates OAS1, which synthesizes 2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylate. the second messenger activates ribonuclease L (R RIG-I have two adjacent CARD domains at their N-terminus. these domains are important for transmitting structural changes via the conserved helicase domains. this leads to the activation of the adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) on mitochondrial membranes. a full-blown interferon response could be detrimental due to the potentially cytotoxic effector mechanisms induced. a study showed that suppression of the IFN response in mESCs depends on miRNA mediated silencing of MAVS. human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells express a subset of ISGs, including IFITM1, IFITM3, EIF3L, and BST2. antiviral protection may extend to other virus families as IFITM-family members restrict entry of diverse viruses. mmalian viruses, including vaccinia virus E3L, reovirus s3, bunyavirus NSs, and herpesvirus US11, likely bind viral dsRNA to prevent detection by cellular dsRNA sensors. another mode of action is antagonism of IFN pathway components such as RLRs or downstream signaling components including IRF7, STAT1 or STAT2 [152] antiviral RNAi is widely active against a large number of RNA and DNA viruses in insects. the most prominent viral dsRNA sources are (i) genomes of dsRNA viruses, (ii) replication intermediates of positive and negative sense RNA viruses, (iii) long fold-back structures in viral RNA, and (iv) convergent transcripts from the gene-dense genomes of DNA viruses. inactivation of Dicer-2 and Ago2 in mosquitoes results in higher viral titers upon infection with different viruses. RNAi targets viral RNA using two distinct steps, first by cleavage of dsRNA replication intermediates and second, through slicing of single-stranded RNAs by Ago2. RNAi has antiviral activity against non-natural and natural viruses. RNAi suppressors have been identified and the mechanisms by which they suppress RNAi are diverse. one of the best characterized VSRs is the Flock House virus (FHV) B2 protein, which is able to inhibit RNA silencing both in animals and plants [182], indicative of interference at evolutionarily conserved features [182] RNAi suppresses RNAi by inhibiting the processing of long dsRNA by Dicer-2 in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. the existence of VSRs in insect viruses is indicative of the strong evolutionary pressure exerted by the RNAi pathway. an ongoing cycle of adaptation and counter-adaptation could lead to host specificity of VSRs. vsiRNA biogenesis and RISC loading can occur in the absence of Loqs-PD. RISC is programmed to specifically recognize and slice viral RNA, resulting in reduced viral replication [11,163,164,165,166] the importance of RNAi in antiviral defense has been demonstrated using fly mutants deficient in Dicer-2, R2D2 and Ago2. insects do not encode RdRP genes, yet it has been proposed that a systemic immune response is established through spread of the RNAi signal to non-infected cells. this occurs via a non-conventional mechanism in which viral RNA is reverse transcribed into viral DNA by cellular retrotransposons. this followed by transcription of these viral DNA forms for de novo synthesis of secondary siRNAs. the importance of this suppressor for viral replication in vivo has been demonstrated in several studies [55,164,186]. fHV mutants deficient in B2 expression were found to have severe replication defects in RNAi-competent Drosophila, but not in RNAi-deficient flies. VSRs have also been identified in members of other insect virus families. mammals only encode a single Dicer protein, which processes both miRNAs and siRNAs. a single AGO protein (AGO2) is capable of slicing target RNA, but also mediates miRNA-dependent gene silencing. several genetic tools have been generated to study mammalian RNAi. small RNA sequences are analyzed using bioinformatics tools. the detection of vsiRNAs of 22 nt in length would be indicative of viral dsRNA targeting by Dicer. several studies failed to identify vsiRNAs in virus infected mammalian cells. antiviral RNAi was observed in differentiated cells using viruses that are VSR defective, in pluripotent stem cells, or under conditions in which the interferon response in inactivated. recent studies reporting viral small RNA profiles in mammalian experimental systems. small RNA no [205] monkey Vero cells total small RNA no [202] Vsicular stomatitis virus Rhabdoviridae mice MEFs total small RNA no [202] Zika virus Flaviviridae human Neural progenitor cells total small RNA yes [210] MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; a Defined as a peak of 22-nt (+/- 1 nt) in size profiles of viral dsRNA binding proteins have a dual function in suppressing the IFN pathway and RNAi. the yellow fever virus capsid protein has also been proposed to bind dsRNA and prevent Dicer processing. the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) has been proposed as an suppressor RNAi. a RNAi suppression was shown in mosquitoes, but not analyzed in mammals. a notable exception is the B2 protein of Nodamura virus, like FHV a member of the family Nodaviridae. inactivation of VSRs may be required to veil antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian cells. the same study found that an influenza A virus mutant lacking NS1 replicates only poorly. this replication defect was rescued in cells deficient in PKR. NS1 does not inhibit RNAi in mammals using reporter assays or engineered viruses. sensitivity to detect rare vsiRNAs may be increased by enrichment for siRNAs bound to AGO2. vsiRNAs with the characteristics of canonical siRNAs were detected upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), the level of which substantially decreased upon cell differentiation. mESCs with the Nodamura virus B2 mutant failed to produce vsiRNAs. dsRNA knockdown or transgenic expression of nodamura virus B2 increases viral RNA levels. RNAi is crucial for processing long dsRNA into siRNAs. the activity of human Dicer is dependent on the substrate. rates on pre-miRNAs and long dsRNA suggest different modes of recognition and/or processing of miRNA and siRNAs in vivo. vsiRNAs were detected in human somatic cells ectopically expressing an N-terminally truncated version of human Dicer. expression of dicer-O is driven by an insertion in intron 6 of an MT-C retroelement [243], a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotranspos a dsRNA threading mechanism has thus far not been reported. whether the threading mechanism of Dicer is essential for efficient antiviral RNAi remains an interesting question for future research. a large-scale proteomics study identified a physical interaction of LGP2 and Dicer [245], which was shown to contribute to suppression of the RNAi pathway [20]. Binding of LGP2 to Dicer prevented cleavage of long dsRNA into siRNAs in vitro and ectopic expression of LGP2 in IFNAR1-/- cells inhibited RNAi. the effect was less pronounced than in cells lacking IFNAR1 [20]. small RNAs in size range of 18\u201325/30 nt are purified and subjected to deep sequencing. detection of vsiRNAs of 22 nt in length would be indicative of viral dsRNA targeting by Dicer. several studies failed to identify vsiRNAs in virus infected mammalian cells [16,17,18,19,202] several recent studies have proposed that antiviral RNAi is functional in mammalian cells under specific cellular or experimental conditions. antiviral RNAi was observed in differentiated cells using viruses that are VSR defective, in pluripotent stem cells, or under conditions in which the interferon response in inactivated. RNA no [202] Coxsackie virus B3 Picornaviridae human HeLa cells total small RNA no [17] mice MEFs total small RNA no [205] human HEK293 cells total small RNA no [205] monkey Vero cells total small RNA no [205] Vesicular stomatitis virus Rhabdoviridae mice MEFs total small RNA no [202] Yellow fever virus Flaviviridae human HeLa ura virus, NS1 of influenza A virus, 3A protein of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), Ebolavirus VP35, and yellow fever virus capsid [14,15,171,206,211,212] dsRNA binding proteins possess a dual function in suppressing both the IFN pathway and RNAi. the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) has been proposed as an suppressor RNAi [218]. binding Yes Inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. a notable exception is the B2 protein of nodamura virus. a notable exception is the B2 protein of nodamura virus. wild-type Nodamura virus B2 mutants showed a broad range of replication defects in different mammalian cell lines. this suggests that suppression by VSRs can mask antiviral activity of RNAi and that inactivation of VSRs may be required to detect antiviral RNAi. observations have been confirmed in a study using wildtype and NS1 mutant influenza A virus in 293T cells and the lung epithelial cell line A549 [207] however, these vsiRNAs did not affect viral gene expression in this study, likely caused, at least partially, by inefficient vsiRNA loading into RISC [207] the discrepancy between studies that did not detect vsiRNAs may be partly explained by the use of influenza NS1 mutants [ vsiRNAs with the characteristics of canonical siRNAs were detected upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus. vsiRNAs were observed upon infection of mESCs with the Nodamura virus B2 mutant. wildtype virus failed to produce vsiRNAs [13,14] dicer is crucial for processing long dsRNA into siRNAs. the activity of human Dicer is dependent on the substrate. this suggests different modes of recognition and/or processing of miRNA and siRNA in vivo. the antiviral Dicer of Drosophila, Dicer-2, has two distinct modes to process dsRNA substrates. substrates with 3\u2019overhangs are cleaved distributively, whereas blunt dsRNA is locally unwound, threaded through the helicase domain, and processively cleaved in an ATP dependent manner. IFN-deficient cells were protected from virus infection by prior treatment with virus sequence-specific long dsRNA [21]. a proteomics study identified a physical interaction of LGP2 and Dicer [245], which was subsequently shown to contribute to suppression of the RNAi pathway. this study identified a physical interaction of LGP2 and Dicer [20], which was subsequently shown to contribute to suppression of the RNAi pathway. viral infection or treatment with the dsRNA mimic poly I:C induced ADP-ribosylation of AGO2 resulting in inhibition of RISC activity. inhibition of RISC may increase ISG expression, suggesting that this mechanism contributes to the rapid ISG expression upon viral infection [247]. s seem to play an important role in differentiated cells, demonstrated by the accumulation of vsiRNAs during nodamura virus B2 and HEV71 3A mutant virus infections [13,14,206]. these findings were complemented by the detection of AGO2-associated siRNAs in somatic cells infected with Influenza A virus NS1 [15]. Virus infection induces the expression of type I interferons. the interferon pathway inhibits RNAi via multiple mechanisms. miRNAs inhibit expression of ISGs."}
