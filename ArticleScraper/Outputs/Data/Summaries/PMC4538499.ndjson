{"summary": "infection by influenza virus is initiated by cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 subunits and leads to the exposure of the hydrophobic N terminus of HA2. the HA cleavage site is an external loop that links HA1 and HA2. this loop is an external loop that links HA1 and HA2. serpins have been shown to inhibit the cleavage of HA. they include aprotinin (13), leupeptin (14), pulmonary surfactant (15), an inhibitor of plasminogen activation (16), and human mucus protease inhibitor (17). kallikreins are serine proteases that comprise kallikrein-related peptidases (KLK1 to KLK15) KLK1 is ubiquitously expressed, while KLK2 and KLK3 are expressed only in the prostate. kallistatin also exhibits pleiotropic effects independently of the KLK1-kinin system, such as reduction of blood pressure, vasodilatation, and inhibition of inflammation. the naturally occurring KLK1 inhibitor is ubiquitously expressed in the human respiratory system (26, 39) it may also play a role in influenza virus infection, either KLK1 dependent or independent. our results indicate that KLK1 could cleave and activate HA molecules and enhance viral replication in cultured cells. l human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 50 ng/ml bovine pituitary extract. supplemented with 5 ng/ml insulin and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone. to produce stocks of influenza A/WSN/33 and A/Taiwan/N2723/06. recombinant lentiviruses LV-KS, LV-GFP, and LV-Null were produced by transfection of 293T cells with pWPXL-Kallistatin, pWPXL, and pSin-null. all work on influenza viruses and recombinant lentiviral vectors was carried out in biosafety level 2 laboratories. recombinant HA proteins (100 ng in 20 l saline) derived from influenza A/WSN/33, A/California/04/09, and A/Japan/305/57 viruses were incubated with kallistatin (12.5, 25, or 50 g/ml) and/or KLK1 (0.5 or 1 g/ml), and influenza A/WSN/33 and A/Taiwan/N2723/ goat anti-influenza A virus (H1N1) antiserum (Virostat, Portland, ME, USA), mouse anti-influenza A H1N1 virus HA monoclonal antibody (C-102; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), rabbit anti-influenza A virus H2N2 HA antibody (Sino Biological Inc.), rabbit anti-influenza A virus H3N2 HA antibody (Sino Biological the PCR conditions for kallistatin were 28 cycles of 60 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 56\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. the PCR conditions for kallistatin were 35 cycles of 60 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 56\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. viable cells were stained with crystal violet, wells were scanned, and crystal violet staining was quantified using ImageJ software. confluent MDCK cells (4 105/well) grown in 12-well plates were incubated with 0.5 ml of 10-fold serially diluted virus samples in serum-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were then fixed with 0.1% crystal violet containing formalin for 24 h. mice were intranasally inoculated with 7 106 PFU of influenza A/WSN/33 virus. the mice were monitored daily for illness and death for 13 days. mice that had been treated with LV-KS or LV-GFP were challenged with influenza A virus. the levels of mouse IL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), IL-6, gamma interferon (IFN-), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) in the BAL fluid or serum were detected with ELISA kits. gentamicin was cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium containing 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor and 50 ng/ml bovine pituitary extract. the cultures were replenished with serum-free DMEM in the absence of trypsin for 24 h. the lentiviral vector pSin-null was derived from pSin-EF2-Oct4-Pur. the coding region of Oct4 was removed by digestion with SpeI and BamHI. the resulting large fragment of the plasmid was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligated by T4 DNA ligase. to detect cleavage of influenza A virus per se by KLK1, influenza A/WSN/33 and A/Taiwan/N2723/06 viruses were incubated with KLK1 at a concentration of 2.5, 5, or 15 g/ml for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. after incubation, the patterns of HA cleavage were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. immunoblot analysis was performed to detect KLK1, kallistatin, and influenza virus HA using standard methods. primary antibodies used for immunoblotting included mouse monoclonal anti-prekallikrein/kallikrein antibody (Abcam), goat anti-influenza A virus (H1N1) antiserum (Virostat, Portland, ME, USA) the PCR conditions for kallistatin were 28 cycles of 60 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 56\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. the PCR conditions for kallistatin were 35 cycles of 60 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 56\u00b0C.

RESULTS KLK1 expression is increased, whereas kallistatin expression is reduced, during acute influenza virus infection. immunoblot analysis showed that KLK1 was upregulated, whereas expression levels of kallistatin remained similar in the lungs of mice at days 3 and 6 p.i. /WSN/33 (H1N1) virus or saline, and lung tissues were collected for immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis at days 3 and 6 p.i. each lane represents samples from individual mouse lungs. expression levels of KLK1 and kallistatin proteins after normalization to -actin levels. KLK1 cleaved recombinant HA proteins of influenza A/WSN/33, A/California/04/09, and A/Brisbane/10/07 viruses into HA1 and HA2 subunits. cleavage efficiencies appeared to be different among various strains of influenza A virus. treatment with KLK1 increased proteolytic cleavage of viral HA on the surface of influenza A/WSN/33 virus in a dose-dependent manner. but the cleavage of viral HA on the surface of influenza A/Taiwan/N2723/06 (H3N2) virus by KLK1 was less efficient. HA1 plus HA2 plus HA0 representing the HA cleavage efficiency are shown at the bottom of the blots. the results are representative of three independent experiments. treatment with KLK1 enhanced virus-induced CPE. a weak enhancement of virus-induced CPE was seen only at much higher KLK1 doses. a weak enhancement of virus-induced CPE was seen only at much higher KLK1 doses. the results are representative of three independent experiments. MDCK cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus at an MOI of 5 or mock infected in the presence of KLK1 for 72 h. the wells were scanned, and crystal violet staining was quantified to determine cell survival. the results are representative of three independent experiments. kallistatin inhibits HA cleavage and reduces influenza virus production in vitro. treatment with recombinant kallistatin proteins dose-dependently inhibited KLK1-mediated cleavage of recombinant HA proteins of influenza A/WSN/33, A/California/04/09, and A/Japan/305/57 viruses. kallistatin also inhibited the HA cleavage A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/California/04/09 (H1N1), and influenza A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2) viruses (100 ng in 20 l saline) (A) and influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Taiwan/N2723/06 (H3N2) virus particles (105 PFU in 5 l serum-free DMEM) (B) levels in the mock-infected cells arbitrarily set to 100, represent means and SD (P 0.0001; one-way ANOVA). the results are representative of two independent experiments. cells transduced with the kallistatin gene are more resistant to influenza virus infection. MDCK cells that had been transduced with LV-KS or LV-Null were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.05. treatment with LV-KS protects mice against lethal influenza virus challenge and alleviates lung inflammation. mice pretreated with LV-KS produced lower levels of IL-1 in the BAL fluid at day 3 p.i. than those pretreated with LV-GFP. no statistical differences in levels of TNF-, IL-6, IFN-, MCP-1, and MIP-1 in the BAL fluid at day 3 p.i. were found between LV-KS- and LV-GFP-treated mice. atin gene delivery improves survival and decreases viral loads, IL-1 levels, and severity of lung pathology in influenza virus-infected mice. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with 107 TU of LV-KS or LV-GFP for 3 consecutive days. after 72 h, levels of kallistatin in the lung were detected by ELISA. stained longitudinal cross sections were graded as no changes (score = 0), mild (score = 1), moderate (score = 2), or severe (score = 3) based on severity of inflammation and tissue damage (means and SD; n = 4 to 6; P = 0.0008; one-way ANOVA) the results are representative of three independent experiments. mice were intranasally inoculated with 107 PFU of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus or saline. lung tissues were collected for immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis. each lane represents samples from individual mouse lungs. medium was assessed for kallistatin amounts by ELISA (n = 3; P = 0.0029 by one-way ANOVA) the results are representative of two independent experiments. treatment with KLK1 increased proteolytic cleavage of viral HA on the surface of influenza A/WSN/33 virus in a dose-dependent manner. however, the cleavage of viral HA on the surface of influenza A/Taiwan/N2723/06 (H3N2) virus by KLK1 was less efficient. the exposure time was longer for HA1 and HA2 bands than for HA0 bands to increase sensitivity. the ratios representing the HA cleavage efficiency are shown at the bottom of the blots. the results are representative of three independent experiments. treatment with KLK1 enhanced virus-induced CPE. a weak enhancement of virus-induced CPE was seen only at much higher KLK1 doses. HA1 was stained more weakly than HA2 when 5 or 15 g/ml of KLK1 was used. cells infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus that is susceptible to HA cleavage in the presence of KLK1 produce higher yields of influenza virus than with those without KLK1 treatment. the results are representative of three independent experiments. exogenously added kallistatin inhibits HA cleavage and reduces virus production in vitro. treatment with recombinant kallistatin proteins dose-dependently inhibited KLK1-mediated cleavage of recombinant HA proteins of influenza A/WSN/33, A/California/04/09, and A/Japan/305/57 viruses. kallistatin proteins inhibit HA cleavage and reduces influenza virus production. cleavage patterns of HA proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. films with multiple exposures were analyzed to ensure signals for HA1 and HA2 could be detected. cell viability was significantly higher in MDCK cells transduced with LV-KS. LV-KS-transduced cells produced significantly less virus than LV-Null. endogenous overexpression of kallistatin in MDCK cells decreases influenza virus-induced CPE and reduces viral production. MDCK cells that had been transduced with LV-KS or LV-Null or left untransduced were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.05. expression of human kallistatin in the lungs of mice receiving LV-KS was confirmed. treatment with LV-KS significantly protected the mice against lethal influenza virus challenge compared to treatment with LV-GFP or saline. treated control mice were intranasally inoculated with 107 TU of LV-KS or LV-GFP for 3 consecutive days. after 72 h, levels of kallistatin in the lung were detected by ELISA. the results are representative of three independent experiments. longitudinal cross sections were graded as no changes (score = 0), mild (score = 1), moderate (score = 2) or severe (score = 3) based on severity of inflammation and tissue damage. DISCUSSION Aberrant kallikrein-kinin signaling plays important roles in a wide range of pathological processes, including inflammation. in the lung and trachea, KLK12 is most abundant, whereas KLK1 is moderately expressed (52). kallistatin has been shown to display high specificity toward KLKs. it was shown that KLK5 and KLK12 can be inhibited by 2-antiplasmin, whereas KLK5 can also be inhibited by proteinase C inhibitor (54). kallistatin exerts pleiotropic effects, dependent on or independent of KLK1. it may also attenuate inflammation in both KLK1-dependent and- independent manners in influenza virus infection. kallistatin-treated mice appeared to exhibit less body weight loss. a well-studied neurotropic strain of influenza A/WSN/33 virus could be cleaved most efficiently by KLK1 among the four virus strains. the consensus sequence of the H1 cleavage site is IQSRG, with cleavage occurring between the arginine residue in the P1\u2032 position and the glycine residue in the P1\u2032 position. however, the replacement of the conserved serine residue with a tyrosine residue in the studies on IL-1 receptor knockout mice revealed that IL-1 mediates acute lung inflammatory pathology but enhances survival of influenza virus-infected mice. IL-1 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation and produces IL-1 and IL-18 in human macrophages by a caspase 1-dependent pathway. ELISA kits for quantifying mouse KLK1 and kallistatin levels are not commercially available at this time. further studies will be necessary to determine whether the KLK1-to-kallistatin ratio might serve as an early biomarker for acute influenza virus infection."}
