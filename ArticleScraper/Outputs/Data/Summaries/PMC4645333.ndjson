{"summary": "mumps is a common childhood illness characterized by painful swelling of the parotid glands. it is often accompanied by severe complications such as orchitis, aseptic meningitis, pancreatitis, and deafness. the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of mumps is still poorly understood. epithelial cells are the primary targets of muV in humans. the presence of distinct plasma membrane domains, the apical and basolateral membranes, separated by tight junctions (12) the apical membrane faces the lumen, while the basolateral membrane abuts the stratum of the epithelial cells. small GTPase Rab11-mediated transport of the vRNP complex has been reported to facilitate the apical release of paramyxoviruses as well as influenza A virus (IAV) (26\u201330) we present data on directional MuV entry and exit pathways in polarized cells. MDCK and Calu-3 cells were seeded and cultured on permeable Transwell filter membranes with a 0.4-m or 3.0-m pore size. the formation of an electrically tight monolayer was checked by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TER) with an ERS-2 apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA) 293T cells were transfected with the plasmids by using TransIT LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) and subsequently super anti-actin (clone AC-15) and anti-tubulin (clone DM1A) mouse MAbs were purchased from Sigma. infectious titers of vaccinia virus were determined in triplicate by plaque assay using vero cells in 12-well plates. after 1 to 2 h of virus adsorption, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS and 1% agarose. each protein was visualized with supersignal west Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. l of 80% sucrose in TNE made 1.8 ml of 60% sucrose solution. samples were centrifuged in an SW55Ti rotor (Beckman) at 110,000 g for 3 h. the fractions (1 ml each) were collected from top of the gradient. MDCK and Calu-3 cells were seeded and cultured on permeable Transwell filter membranes with a 0.4-m or 3.0-m pore size. the formation of an electrically tight monolayer was checked by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TER) with an ERS-2 apparatus. the muV strain Odate was isolated from a patient who developed aseptic meningitis (31), and the vaccinia virus strain LC-16 (32) were used in this study. anti-EGFP mouse MAb and anti-ZO-1 rabbit PAb (ab59720) were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), respectively. after 1 to 2 h of virus adsorption, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS and 1% agarose. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. cells were blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. the samples were centrifuged in an SW55Ti rotor (Beckman) at 110,000 g for 3 h. the fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of the gradient. muV entry is bipolar, but release is restricted to the apical surface in polarized epithelial cells. muV infection did not cause significant cytopathic effects in MDCK cells. as in MDCK cells, muV showed bipolar entry, apical release, and little cytopathic effect in another polarized epithelial cell line, Calu-3. polarized MDCK (F) and Calu-3 (G) cells were immunostained at 24 h p.i. with mouse anti-N, -M, or -HN MAb and AF488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. cortical actin and cell nuclei were visualized by AF594-phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue), respectively. the M protein was accumulated at the apical surface but poorly colocalized with EGFP-Rab11WT. similar distribution patterns were observed in polarized Calu-3 cells expressing either EGFP-Rab11WT or -Rab11S25N. expression of Rab11S25N did not influence localization pattern of the HN protein any of the three cell lines. the virus titers released from the cells expressing either EGFP-Rab11WT or -Rab11S25N were determined. in a control infection, expression of EGFP-Rab11S25N did not inhibit vaccinia virus replication in polarized MDCK cells. in contrast, virus titers in polarized MDCK and Calu-3 cells expressing EGFP-Rab11S25N were 20-fold and 3-fold Polarized MDCK cells expressing either of the EGFP-Rab11s were infected with MuV. at 24 h p.i., the proteins in the cell lysates and the floated fraction were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. the relative band intensities of MuV N and M in the floated fraction were normalized by those in the cell lysate. viral protein synthesis was slightly decreased in MDCK cells expressing EGFP-Rab11S25N. however, physical viral particles purified and detected by immunoblotting were barely detectable in the culture media of EGFP-Rab11S25N-expressing cells. in both apical and basolateral media, the progeny virus was predominantly detected in the apical-chamber media. both nonpolarized (1 days p.s.) and polarized (5 days p.s.) MDCK cells were infected with muV. expression of EGFP-Rab11S25N caused a 3-fold reduction in the released progeny virus in nonpolarized cells. vRNP transport was not observed in polarized MDCK cells expressing EGFP-Rab11S25N. vN MAb and AF633-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were visualized by AF594-phalloidin (pseudocolored blue) the effects of nocodazole-induced MT disruption on vRNP trafficking and virus release in polarized epithelial cells. polarized MDCK cells infected with muV at an MOI of 5.0 were treated with nocodazole (5 M) or DMSO. at 24 h p.i., cell lysates were immunostained with mouse anti--actin MAb. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) al cells, polarized MDCK cells were infected with muV at either the apical or basolateral surface. the basolaterally infected cells produced 3-fold-lower virus titers than the apically infected cells. this reduction was likely due to the small restriction of virus migration through the 3.0-m filters. Apical and basolateral culture supernatants were collected separately at 24 h p.i. Polarized MDCK (B and C) and Calu-3 (D and E) cells on 3.0-m Transwell filters were infected with MuV from the apical or basolateral surface at an MOI of 5.0. negative form (Rab11S25N) were used (29). the muV N protein was colocalized with EGFP-Rab11WT. it was concentrated in the cytoplasm of polarized MDCK cells expressing EGFP-Rab11S25N. the M protein showed a diffuse distribution pattern in the cytoplasm. 11S25N were infected with muV at an MOI of 1.0. at 24 h postinfection, the cells were immunostained with mouse anti-MuV N, M or HN MAb and AF633-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. cortical actin was visualized by AF594-phalloidin (pseudocolored blue) Polarized MDCK cells expressing either of the EGFP-Rab11s were infected with vaccinia virus at an MOI of 10. at 24 h p.i., both the supernatants and cells were collected and sonicated, and then the infectious titers were determined. results shown are from three independent experiments, with the error bars representing the standard deviations. the percentages of total release in the apical and basolateral media were determined by plaque assay. the significance of differences was determined by Student's t test. MDCK cells were not yet polarized, as indicated by the low TER (180 /cm2) and the lack of distinct ZO-1 staining at the cell junction. both nonpolarized (1 days p.s.) and polarized (5 days p.s.) MDCK cells were infected with muV. expression of EGFP-Rab11S25N caused a 3-fold reduction in the released progeny virus. polarized or nonpolarized MDCK cells expressing either of the EGFP-Rab11s were infected with muV. at 24 h p.i., the cells were immunostained with mouse anti-MuV N MAb and AF633-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. cortical actin was visualized by AF594-phalloidin. polarized MDCK cells treated with nocodazole (5 M) or DMSO were immunostained with mouse anti--tubulin MAb. the supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i., and the infectious titers were determined. the significance of differences was determined by Student's t test. release occurs via the apical (luminal) side, leading to an efficient regional spread. the basolateral entry is likely used for secondary infection via the bloodstream during the viremic phase. the direction of virus release is assumed to determine the spread of infection. apical recycling endosomes (ARE) are involved in regulated recycling of specialized apical proteins. Rab11 plays roles in apical vRNP trafficking and particle formation of many RNA viruses in polarized epithelial cells. the transport of MuV HN protein was not regulated by Rab11. the apical accumulation of the M protein was impaired by disrupting the Rab11 functions. the vRNP transport could facilitate the interaction between the N and M proteins and the efficient virus budding. muV infection did not cause significant cytopathic effects in either polarized MDCK or Calu-3 cells and did not disrupt the integrity of the polarized cell layer. further studies will be needed to clarify how muV breaks through the epithelial barrier during initial infection."}
