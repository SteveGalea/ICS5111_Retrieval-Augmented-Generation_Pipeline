{"summary": "the threat from MERS-CoV remains a cause for global health concern. it is therefore important to establish the epidemiology of MERS-CoV transmission within camels. dromedary camels have been proposed as a means to reduce the threat. camel herd was a camel herd of 80 dromedaries in the eastern province. the animals were housed in one compound and provided with feed in barns. there was no contact with nomadic camel herds. swabs and serum samples were collected from dromedary camels in two herds in the eastern and central regions of Saudi Arabia between September 2014 and may 2015. the same animals were resampled whenever possible by examination of dentation. herd 1 This group was a camel herd of 80 animals in the Eastern Province. the camels were housed in one compound and provided with feed in barns. there was no contact with nomadic camel herds. 12 MERS-CoV antibody was tested using a validated MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT) in herd 1, 29 camels, including 2 calves, were sampled; 8 were sampled in October 2014, 9 in November 2014, 15 in January 2015 and 13 in February 2015. in herd 2, 70 dromedaries were sampled, including 16 calves 2 years of age, 5 animals 3\u20135 years of age, 35 animals 6 years of age and 14 animals of undetermined age. ten camels were sampled in september 2014, 43 in October 2014, 28 in November 2014, 45 in January 2015, 24 in February/March 2015 and 52 in may 2015. 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 NEG 320 F2-14 F 7 NA 10240 NEG 5120 NEG 320 F2-14 F 7 NA 10240 NEG 5120 NEG 320 F2-14 F 7 NA 10240 NEG 5120 NEG 5120 NEG 5120 F2-15 F 6 NEG 640 F2-16 F 2 NA 1280 NEG 1280 NEG 2560 F2-17 F 12.5 NA 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 NEG 320 F F2-39 F 17 NEG 2560 NA 1280 F2-40 F 15 NEG 1280 NA 640 NEG 640 NEG 320 F2-41 F 15 NEG 1280 NA 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 F2-42 NA NA NEG (RO) 10240 F2-43 F 3 NEG NA NEG 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 NEG 640 F2-42 NA NA NEG (RO) 10240 F2-43 F 3 NEG NA N a MERS-CoV antibody positive at a screening dilution of 1:20; fourfold rise in antibody titersa RT-PCR Antibody positive or rising antibody titersa RT-PCR Antibody positive or rising antibody titersa RT-PCR Antibody positive or rising antibody titersa RT-PCR Antibody positive or rising antibody titersa. 0.7 103 copies per mL (specimen F2-33) and 1.4 103 copies per mL (specimen F2-51) were seropositive in the sampling carried out in November. none of the rectal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV. a 7675 nt region of the genome from the spike gene to the N gene was sequenced from the three positive samples. the sequences were closely related but not genetically identical to the MERS-CoV strain Riyadh/Riyadh179/2015. phylogeny also confirmed that these viruses were identical and closely related to Riyadh/Riyadh179/2015. two dromedary herds showed high levels of seropositivity in both herds. one of these herds, namely, herd 2, had evidence of an active MERS-CoV infection. the RT-PCR detection of MERS-CoV confirmed the infection of three camels in November 2014. study of infection within camel herds whose dam and calf pairs were studied. infection occurred in the calves but not in the seropositive dams. this suggests that prior immunity in older animals may prevent reinfection. experimentally infected alpacas have been found to be protected against MERS-CoV reinfection. this test involved a challenge that occurred at a short interval after the previous infection. we cannot exclude infections in other sampled animals whose antibody titers were not observed to rise by fourfold, the usual criterion for a significant antibody response. our detection of six infected camels is likely to be an underestimate of the extent of transmission within this herd. genic variation was unlikely to confound serological tests or lead to antigenic escape from prior antibody immunity. well-designed field studies of vaccinated animals followed up over a period of longer than 1 year would be required to assess the effects of vaccination on decreasing virus transmission between camels."}
