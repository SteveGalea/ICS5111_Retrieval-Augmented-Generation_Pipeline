{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) and satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) still wait for the development of an in vitro infection system in cell culture. the failure of HBV infection is considered to be due to strict restriction on the interaction between HBV virions and the cell membrane. the preS1 peptide can be a useful probe to pull out the interacting cellular factors, including specific viral receptors. they engineered the first 2\u201347 amino acid peptide from preS1 to increase its capacity to be cross-linked with proteins interacting with the cell membrane. they adopted the Tupaia hepatocytes, instead of human hepatocytes, for the experiments. authors could convert cell lines previously non-permissible to HBV infection to permissible by over-expression of NTCP. this could be a critical discovery toward understanding HBV receptors and establishing an experimental HBV infection system. NTCP could initiate or mediate molecular interactions that can overcome the cell-surface restrictions for viral entry. to the development of an HBV infection system to facilitate the HBV research and hepatitis B treatment."}
