{"summary": "the dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes of aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. it comprises four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4) the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) small group of plants (69 nos) around the world have been reported as the potential antiviral agents especially against the dengue. the chosen plants (Pavetta tomentosa and Tarenna asiatica) are shrubby in nature, belongs to family Rubiaceae. plant leaves of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were collected from Yercaud hills, eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. the plants name was authenticated by Botanical Survey of India, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India. larvicidal and pupicidal assay Larvicidal and pupicidal activity of different concentrations (100\u2013900 g/ml) leaf extracts of both plants were carried out as per the modified protocol of world health organization (2005). extracts were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5% DMSO, then diluted with 249 ml of filtered tapwater to obtain the desired concentration of each extract. the 4th instar larvae and pupae (25 the cells became individual and it's present as suspension. the cells became individual and it's present as suspension. the cells became individual and it's present as suspension. acetone extracts of two plants (10mg) were dissolved in 10 mL of serum free MEM. the freshly prepared stock was filtered through 0.45 filter. the working concentration of plant crude extracts was maintained in the range of 1 mg/ml to 125 mg/ml. fourier transmission-infra red analysis The FT-IR spectrum of samples was measured using a DTGS detector. about 5mg of plants sample was mixed with 100 mg of dry potassium bromide (KBr) the pellet was analysed under FTIR spectrophotometer in the range of 4,000 - 500cm-1 at room temperature. the known amount of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica leaf powders (25g) were extracted with five different solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone and methanol) separately in 250ml of Soxhlet apparatus. the extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure (22\u201326 mm Hg) at 45 \u00b0C. the obtained crude extracts were collected in sterilized container and stored at room temperature for larval and pupal mortality was recorded after 24 and 48 h exposure. no food was administered to the larvae and pupae of test mosquito. each well was washed with MEM (w/o) FCS for 2\u20133 times, then add 200l of MTT concentration (5 mg/ml) and incubated for 6\u20137 h in 5% CO2 incubator. after incubation, 1ml of DMSO was added in each well and mixed by pipette and then left aside for 45sec. after 72 h of post inoculation, the cells were stained with trypan blue. the viable cells were counted and marked. 2.9. Phytochemical analysis The preliminary phytochemical analysis of both plants extracts were carried out by the modified protocol of Harbone (1973). 2.10. GC\u2013MS analysis Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis of both plants crude extract was performed in the Agilent 6890 GC equipped with 5,973 N mass selective detectors. crude extracts of both plants exhibit better larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. the acetone and methanol extracts of P. tomentosa showed good mortality rate in Ae. aegypti with the LC50 and LC90 values of 9.325 and 1.223 g/ml. 1.47 1.702 (52.595 67.059) 2.518 (17.995 35.819) 1.80 Ethyl acetate 1.030 (68.757 135.833) 1.442 (104.185 180.778) 7.43 1.741 (54.046 71.381) 2.561 (17.753 38.581) 2.82 Chloroform 1.582 (111.571 199.949) 2.161 (164.761 260.217) 3.75 0.952 (68.893 2.386 (5.438 15.224) 13.5 2 Pupae 24 h Hexane 2.044 (1441.700 4100.200) 8.519 (4208.333 3627.885) 3.366 1.990 (1416.453 4156.741) 6.429 (3341.125 2755.465) 3.02 Ethyl acetate 3.001 (1788.332 9116.596) 2.58 2.351 (1564.964 5414.272) 1.245 (5725.7 2.35 48 h Hexane 1.682 (1222.217 2975.700) 1.169 (5499.152 4800.661) 0.54 3.008 (1680.562 1158.286) 5.723 (1382.214 1728.322) 0.97 Ethyl acetate 2.823 (1558.046 1184.202) 7.612 (1597.633 3845.940) 3.8 1.915 (1191.397 5493.939) 5.036 (126 acetone extract reflects highest pupicidal effect with least LC50 and LC90 values in tested extracts. acetone extract reflects highest pupicidal effect with least LC50 and LC90 values. crude extracts showed significant adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti. acetone and hexane extracts expressed good mortality. best LC50 and LC90 values of P. tomentosa and T. asiatica were observed after 60 min. fected cell line 250 15.29 49.27 6.

GC-MS and FT-IR results of plant samples reflect bioactive compounds and its functional groups. N-Hexadecanoic acid, Palmitic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Squalene, Vitamin and Carboxylic acids, Esters, alkenes, alkynes, alcohol were present in P. tomentosa. the preliminary phytochemicals analysis results showed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids and saponins in all extracts of P. tomentosa.
