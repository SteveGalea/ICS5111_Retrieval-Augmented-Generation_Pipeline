{"summary": "rheumatoid factors (RFs)4 are autoantibodies that recognize the fragment-crystallizable (Fc) region of IgG and have long been used as an important diagnostic factor of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) there are differences in genetic diversity and binding pattern to the Fc region. genes, called \u201cstereotypic RFs\u201d, have been reported. the heavy chain variable germline IGHV1-69 is commonly used as the heavy chain of the neutralizing antibodies for HCV (18, 19), HIV (20), influenzae virus (21), and the Staphylococcus aureus virulence factor NEAT (23). crystal structures of two RFs have been determined in complex with Fc. one is a RA patient-derived IgM rheumatoid factor, RF-AN, that recognizes the CH2\u2013CH3 cleft via a site distal to the conventional antigen-binding site (28). the other is a high-affinity IgM rheumatoid factor, RF61, that recognizes the CH3 domain close to the C terminus YES8c is an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 stereotypic RF. it does not show cross-reactivity to self-antigens other than IgG-Fc. the precise binding characteristics are unknown. two YES8c\u2013IgG1-Fc complexes were observed in the asymmetric crystal unit. each YES8c\u2013IgG1-Fc complex was designated complex 1 or complex 2. 98.7 (95.1)a Redundancy 4.6 (3.8)a Refinement Resolution 20.0\u20132.80 No. of reflections 40,124 Rwork 0.221 Rfree 0.270 No. of atoms Protein 8,175 Water 64 Average B-factor 52.0 RMSDs Bond lengths (\u00b0) 0.632 Ramachandran plot (%) Favored 95.12 Allowed 4.04 Disallowed 0.85 a The highest shell statistics are in parentheses. YES8c has a large buried surface area (BSA) within the complex, compared with RF-AN (1458 2) and RF61 (1689 2). the YES8c BSA value ranks in the top 30% of the published protein\u2013antibody complex structures. the residues in the heavy chain were highly conserved among the 12 IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs, except for a part of CDR-H1 and the entirety of CDR-H3. the interfacial area (590 2) and the shape complementarity coefficient (34) are larger than those of the light chain. the heavy chain of YES8c is bound to yES8c. the heavy chain and the light chain of YES8c are shown as cyan and green surfaces, and the Fc is shown as magenta sticks. the hydrophobicity of the CDR-H2 tip is a characteristic of the heavy chain derived from the IGHV1-69 germline. in YES8c, the hydrophobic residues interact with the hydrophobic moiety in the CH2\u2013CH3 cleft comprised of Ile253 and Leu314. GHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs throughout the light chain of YES8c. the number of residues participating in Fc binding (10\u201311 residues) and the binding interface area (430\u2013450 2) is much larger than that of RF-AN (two residues and 196 2) and RF61 (five residues and 255 2). binding of mutants in the light chain of YES8c to the immobilized IgG1 by ELISA. data show mean S.D. (error bars) from triplicates from two independent experiments with similar results. a binding response similar to that of the WT was observed for L-I28V. a response similar to that of the WT was not observed for H-P33A. binding of the germline-reverted mutants to IgG1-Fc was measured by ELISA. the YES8c mutants (H-T56K, H-N58K, L-Q27E, and L-S27AN) showed increased binding to IgG1-Fc. the affinity increases were confirmed by SPR analysis. the YES8c mutants (42, 94, 78, and 69 m) were lower than that of WT. YES8c is a monoreactive IgM RF that does not show cross-reactivity to self-antigens other than IgG-Fc. the precise binding characteristics are unknown. YES8c was categorized as another subclass specificity group. representative sensorgrams derived from injection of different concentrations of YES8c-Fab over immobilized human IgG1 by surface plasmon resonance analysis. the black horizontal bar indicates the region of the sensorgrams. the line represents a nonlinear fit of the 1:1 binding model. 189.9, 189.9, 79.6, (\u00b0) 90.0, 90.0, 120.0 Resolution () 20.0\u20132.80 (2.85\u20132.80)a Rmerge 0.074 (0.355)a CC12 of the highest-resolution shell 0.917 I/I 19.1 (2.6)a Completeness (%) 98.7 (95.1)a Redundancy 4.6 (3.8)a Refinement Resolution () 20.0\u20132.80 No. of reflections 40, YES8c has a large buried surface area (BSA) within the complex. the number of contact residues, buried surface area, number of non-covalent interactions is similar to that of RF-AN and RF61. the number of van der Waals interactions is similar to that of RF-AN and RF61. a 0 0 1 2 Hydrogen bondsa 7 8 5 12 van der Waals contactsa 71 81 66 74 Shape complementarity (Sc score) LH-Fc 0.65 0.67 0.69 0.69 L-Fc 0.57 0.58 0.44 0.65 H-Fc 0.73 0.75 0.69 a The criteria of the atomic contacts are as follows: C-C, 4.1. residues in CDR-H3 (especially from H-Ala99 to H-Pro100B) are located in the space between CH2 and CH3. the amino acid composition of CDR-H3 in IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs is diverse. the residues are numbered based on the Kabat numbering scheme. E, interactions between CDR-H2 of YES8c and Fc. bindings were lower in H-I52A and H-L53A mutants compared with the WT. the binding was significantly lower in the H-F54A mutant. the binding decreased by one-half for L-Y96A. binding of mutants in the light chain of YES8c to the immobilized IgG1 by ELISA. contacting area of the light chain to Fc is shown in green. contacting area of the light chain to Fc is shown in green. residues (L-I28V, H-P33A, and H-L53I) were analyzed by ELISA. binding was lower in the H-P33A mutant than in the WT. binding increased in the H-L53I mutant compared with WT. the YES8c mutants (H-T56K, H-N58K, L-Q27E, and L-S27AN) displayed increased binding to IgG1-Fc (Fig. S10A) the binding affinity increases were confirmed by SPR analysis. the solid line represents a nonlinear fit of the 1:1 binding model for H-T56K, H-N58K, L-Q27E, and L-S27AN. the RFs derived from the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 germline combination have long been studied as paraprotein-IgM RFs observed in MC and WM. the low affinity of YES8c Fab is consistent with that found in a previous study for RF-AN (28). despite the low affinity, RFs exert an enhanced avidity in the IgM form. the YES8c\u2013Fc complex had a larger interfacial area, and more residues participated in the binding. we propose a model that allows for the diversity of the CDR-H3 loop of IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs in the RF-Fc binding site. most of the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs have a CDR-H3 composed of 12\u201315 amino acids. if CDR-H3 is shorter than 12 amino acids then the loop may not be accepted in the space between CH2 and CH3. structure determination of other IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs with different CDR-H3 will be required. hydrophobic residues in CDR-H2 are considered to participate in pattern recognition. the binding of the germline-reverted mutants with IgG1-Fc was explored. the affinity of the H-L53I mutant to IgG1-Fc doubled. it remains unclear whether a combined germline-reverted mutant has RF activity. experimental procedures Preparation of YES8c-Fab expressed in Escherichia coli. heavy chain composed of variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) from YES8c IgM and CH1 from IgG1 were separately expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. refolded Fab was purified by Resource S cation exchange chromatography. the two-dimensional structures of the Fab mutants were confirmed by CD spectroscopy (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) the humanized IgG1 mAb rituximab was treated with 1/10 (w/w) of papain activated with 10 mm l-cysteine for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. the papain-digested IgG1 was applied to COSMOGEL\u00ae Ig-Accept protein A resin.
