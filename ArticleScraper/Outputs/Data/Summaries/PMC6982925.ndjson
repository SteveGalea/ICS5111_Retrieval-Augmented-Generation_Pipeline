{"summary": "aptamers are single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides that fold up into a distinctive 3D structure capable of binding with high affinity and specificity to small molecules up to entire organisms. the first oligonucleotide aptamer was isolated to bind with small molecules [2] by a random library of single-stranded oligonucleotides sequences. aptamers and selection methods are obtained using a Darwinian evolution screening technology called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) aptamers require an additional step of reverse transcription before amplification. aptamers require an additional step of reverse transcription before amplification. conventional SELEX generates aptamers by incubating a library composed of 1013 to 1015 different folded oligonucleotide sequences with the target of choice. this library is composed of random sequences in the middle and constant regions at the 5\u2032- and -3\u2032 ends. after incubation, the bound sequences can be separated from the remaining unbound sequences, retained, and then amplified to be reintroduced in iterative selection cycles. crossover-SELEX First, oligonucleotides are enriched using cell-SELEX. the product of cell-SELEX is then enriched against its purified protein. crossover-SELEX is useful for targets that are rare in their original environment. aptamers are identified through a random pool containing billions of sequences. enriched sequences are visible at a much earlier round, which is more time efficient. aptamers are selected by in vitro SELEX methods. aptamers have many superior advantages over antibodies as the targeting ligand, including shorter production time, lower synthesis costs, better thermal stability, and wider spectrum of targets. aptamers have many advantages over antibodies, including shorter production time, lower synthesis costs, better thermal stability, and wider spectrum of targets. aptamer modification can be achieved either into the scaffold of selected aptamers through standard solid-phase synthesis (post-selection modification) or by using modified nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) in the selection process. the common chemical modification approaches of nucleic acid aptamers for the development of clinical therapeutics are discussed in the following sections. the 3\u2032-biotin modified-DNA aptamer targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome was sustained in fetal bovine serum (FBS) in double the time compared to unmodified aptamer. the stability of selected non G-quadruplex aptamer (NG8) that was modified with 3\u2032-biotin or 3\u2032-inverted thymidine aptamer was increased. a minor structural change of an oligonucleotide at the two terminal internucleotide bonds is sufficient to stabilize these end-inverted (INV) oligonucleotides against nuclease degradation. the modified cholODN-LDL version showed high stability against rat serum nucleases. imidine-modified RNA aptamer targeting the hepatitis C virus NS5B protein extended the aptamer plasma circulation time nine-fold compared to the unmodified version. a 5\u2032-cholesterol-modified oligonucleotide (ARC155) showed more rapid plasma clearance relative to the unconjugated aptamer. a diacylglycerol (DAG) lipid anchor was conjugated to the 5\u2032- the conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to drugs has been shown to increase the residence time of the drug in the body. an amino-modified spiegelmer NOX-E36 oligonucleotide was conjugated with (NHS)-ester-activated polyethylene glycol via carbodiimide coupling. the sbC-PEGylated aptamers had improved pharmacokinetic properties. one of the sbC-PEGylated aptamers, 17M-382, inhibited interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a concentration-dependent manner. the bifunctionalized anti-MUC1 aptamer (NH(2)-AptA-SR) was conjugated with different PEG types. the 2\u2032-Fluoro (2\u2032-F), 2\u2032-amino (2\u2032-NH2) and 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-OMe) are the most common 2\u2032-substitute modifications on the ribose unit. they are used to increase nuclease resistance and optimize aptamer affinity. pegaptanib is a 2\u2032-multimodified RNA aptamer. it binds with very high affinity to the human vascular endothelial growth factor. aptamers bind equally well to murine VEGF164, do not bind to VEGF121 or the smaller isoform of placenta growth factor. aptamer (E07) had strong binding affinity (KD = 2.4 nM) for the wild-type receptor, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. other 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamers (A10) had been isolated and tested for their potential treatment of human prostate cancer cells via the prostate-specific membrane antigen. a combination of three 2\u2032-OMe-NTPs was used in a SELEX experiment to generate an aptamer that binds to the polypeptide tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) this modified aptamer showed high selectivity and binding affinity to correct thrombin generation hemophilia A and B [82] a 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro-modified arabinonucleotide (2\u2032F-ANA) was investigated based on the nuclease resistance of 2\u2032F-ANA-modified thrombin-binding aptamers was increased up to 48-fold in 10% FBS, with a 4- to 5-fold enhancement in binding affinity to thrombin [13] Wilds and Damha used UV thermal melting and CD experiments to discover the thermodynamic stability and helical conformation of 2\u2032F-ANA/RNA and 2\u2032F-ANA/DNA hybrids. minakawa et al. isolated fully modified 4\u2032-thioRNA aptamers against human alpha-thrombin using four types of 4\u2032-thioribonucleoside triphosphates. the modified aptamer showed a high affinity (KD = 4.7 nM), with a 50-fold increase in resistance to RNase A. aptamer is a DNA aptamer against lymphoma Ramos cells. aptamer is a derivative of ribonucleotide with a methylene bridge. aptamer was modified with LNA and a 2\u2032-amino derivative. a thrombin-binding quadruplex aptamer with a UNA-modified thrombin-binding aptamer (UNA-modified TBA) was developed. it was found that UNA substitution in the loops of the quadruplex could increase binding affinity and clotting time in blood samples. the aptamers modified simultaneously with UNA and LNAs possess a two-fold higher anticoagulant effect. thylphosphonate or phosphorothioate can be achieved by replacing the phosphodiester linkage with methylphosphonate or phosphorothioate on the -phosphorous. phosphorothioate modification might influence the thermal stability of the quadruplex structure in different G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides. cleotide of RNA aptamers improved target binding affinity by 1000-fold. post-SELEX modifications by adding short phosphorothioate caps to the 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-ends of the 2\u2032-amino-modified RNA and DNA aptamers against VPF/VEGF showed high binding affinity and increased nuclease resistance. thioaptamer binds to DENV-2 EDIII, with a dissociation constant of 154 nM. thioaptamer was selected from large combinatorial libraries, with CD44 (CD44TA) targeting moiety. this thioaptamer significantly lowered the bacterial load in the lungs. highly modified phosphorothioates or methylphosphonates are less stable than partially modified counterparts, which are less stable than the partially modified parent compounds. methylphosphonate-modified 15mer oligonucleotide, known as the thrombin-binding aptamer (15TBA-M), gave a reversible and concentration-dependent thermal transition. triazole-modified oligonucleotide analogs demonstrated DNA binding affinities similar to those of unmodified oligonucleotides. the modification protected aptamers from nuclease hydrolysis and increased their stabilities. modified 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, dNTPs, were shown to be excellent substrates to be incorporated into DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. modified base aptamers are able to retain target binding properties, and thus they may enhance the binding affinity [118,119] aptamer thymidine was replaced with modified deoxyuridine with a cationic group via a methylene linker. arginine-modified dUTP was involved in a SELEX experiment to improve its enantioselectivity. thynyl-modified dUTP via SELMA selection could recognize the monoclonal antibody, 2G12, which is known to bind to mannose-rich glycans on the HIV envelope protein, gp120. 5-BzdU (5-(N-benzylcarboxyamide)-2-deoxyuridine) modification of the AS1411 aptamer might selectively increase its targeting affinity to cancer cells while having no significant influence on the normal healthy modified carboxamide pyrimidines\u2019 functionality was a smart choice to facilitate the attachment of other hydrophobic groups, such as benzene, thiophene, naphthalene, isopropyl, and amino acid derivatives. a new protocol was recently described to select nucleobase-modified aptamers based on alkyne-modified uridine (5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU)) instead an advanced SOMAmer-based assay was developed for quantification of soluble glypican-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient samples using glypican-3 SOMAmer. the assay verified its good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision compared to the traditional antibody-based assay. NOX-A12 is a structured mirror image RNA oligonucleotide in the l-configuration. it neutralizes stromal cell-derived factor-1 and interferes with leukemia migration and drug resistance. mirror image aptamers are composed of non-natural l-ribose nucleotides. a nuclease-resistant modified l-RNA aptamer (MLRA) with cationic nucleotide, 5\u2032 aminoallyl-uridine, was isolated in an in vitro selection process. this spiegelmer was capable of binding oncogenic pre-miR-19a with exceptional affinity. a cross-chemistry selective exponential enrichment (X-SELEX) approach is used. a laboratory in vitro evolution experiment based on an artificially expanded genetic information system (AEGIS) was reported by Biondi et al. an AEGIS aptamer that binds to an isolated protein target was outlined against an antigen from Bacillus anthracis. cyclic thrombin-binding aptamer (cycTBA) was prepared by covalently bonding the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the linear aptamer via a linker. the thermal stability of cycTBA was highly enhanced. however, its anticoagulant activity dropped by half. ymine linker with variable length proved an enhanced affinity compared to monomers. they also tested a dimer of two identical aptamers against VEGF165. these aptamers suffer from low affinity, which hinders their further application in diagnostics and therapeutics. tin Conjugates Capping the 3\u2032-end with inverted deoxy-thymidine modification is usually used to block 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease attack. this modification requires a modified control pore glass (CPG) with the 5\u2032-hydroxyl of the first nucleoside attached, followed by chain elongation using the classic solid-phase phosphoramidite process. the 3\u2032-biotin-streptavidin attached to the 3\u2032-inverted thymidine aptamer remained intact for 72 and 31 h. the modification showed higher stability than the 3\u2032-biotin modification. but both modifications were significantly more stable than the unmodified aptamer. small aptamers are cleared and excreted rapidly by renal glomerular filtration. the plasma half-life of the cholODN-LDL aptamer was nearly 10 times better than the plasma half-life of the unmodified aptamer. the modified cholODN-LDL version showed high stability against rat serum nucleases. a set of lipids conjugated to 5\u2032-AS1411 aptamer (stearyl- or cholesteryl-based tails) were selected and investigated. a set of lipids conjugated to 5\u2032-AS1411 aptamer (stearyl- or cholesteryl-based tails) were selected and investigated for their conformational behavior and aggregation tendency. MP7 is a DNA aptamer that binds to the murine extracellular domain of PD-1 (programmed death protein 1). conjugation of MP7 DNA aptamers with large PEG molecules at the 5\u2032 terminal could limit the rate of filtration and extend the half-life of this small molecule up to 24 to 48 h. more than 60% of the un-PEGylated aptamer was excreted after 5 h compared to 43% to 51% in the case of the newly modified aptamers. doxorubicin-attached anti-MUC1 aptamer (PEG-APT-DOX) increases the targeting efficacy of the aptamer by reducing the non-specific uptake of doxorubicin by RAW 264.7 macrophages. mbin aptamer was investigated against 3\u2032-exonuclease activity in the blood of rodents. the 3\u2032-biotin modified-DNA aptamer targeted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus helicase was sustained in fetal bovine serum in double the time compared to unmodified aptamer. tris-mTBA inhibits the human thrombin activity 10-fold more efficiently than unmodified TBA and biotin-TBA. a minor structural change of an oligonucleotide at the two terminal internucleotide bonds is sufficient to stabilize these end-inverted (INV) oligonucleotides against nuclease degradation. half-life of the cholODN-LDL aptamer was nearly 10 times better than the plasma half-life of the unmodified aptamer. recently, a cholesterol-conjugated and 2\u2032-F pyrimidine-modified RNA aptamer targeting the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein was modified by Lee et al. this aptamer modification extended the aptamer plasma circulation time nine-fold the 5\u2032-lipidated AS1411 derivatives folded into stable unimolecular G-quadruplex structures, forming large aggregates at a concentration of higher than 10 M. they maintained a similar biological behavior as unmodified aptamer with less cytotoxicity on the selected three different cancer cell lines. sbC-PEGylated aptamers were synthesized by coupling the symmetrical branching molecule 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl phosphoramidite to the 5\u2032 end of the aptamer. the sbC-PEGylated aptamers had improved pharmacokinetic properties and showed excellent stability in the blood circulation. 2\u2032-substitutions Modifications on the ribose unit were effective at improving the aptamer serum half-life. the 2\u2032-Fluoro (2\u2032-F), 2\u2032-amino (2\u2032-NH2) and 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-OMe) are the most common 2\u2032-substitute modifications on the ribose unit. aptamer is used to increase nuclease resistance and optimize aptamer affinity 2\u2032-Amino-modified RNA and DNA aptamers bind to vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) they showed nuclease resistant properties with high binding affinity. aptamers bind equally well to murine VEGF164, do not bind to VEGF121. a promising aptamer (E07) had a strong binding affinity (KD = 2.4 nM) for the wild-type receptor, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. a 2\u2032-fluoropyrimidine-modified RNA aptamer (S2) was generated against the prostate-specific antigen with a KD of 11.9 nM. 2\u2032-F purine aptamers (2fHNE-1 and 2fHNE-2) bind human neutrophil elastase (HNE) they bind HNE with reasonable affinity and the 2\u2032-F purines substituent enhanced nuclease resistance. aptamers can be easily conjugated, as unmodified aptamers, to different nanocarriers loaded with certain chemotherapeutic agents. ts and maintain the quadruplex conformation while replacement of syn-guanines with 2\u2032F-arabino guanosines is not favored and results in a dramatic switch to an alternative quadruplex conformation. the appropriate incorporation of 2\u2032F-ANA residues into G-quadruplexes leads to an increase in the melting temperature of the complex formed. the 2\u2032 F-ANA strand\u2032s structure was more compatible with the A-like structure of a hybrid duplex. 4\u2032-oxygen replacement Replacing the 4\u2032-oxygen atom with a sulfur atom is rarely used in selection experiments of aptamer isolation. the 4\u2032-thio-modified aptamer showed a high affinity (KD = 4.7 nM), with a 50-fold increase in resistance to RNase A. era LNA5, forming a stable complex against HIV-1 trans-activating response (TAR) RNA, was synthesized from a shortened and stable version of the hairpin RNA aptamer identified by in vitro selection against TAR. these modifications provide good protection towards nuclease digestion in bovine serum and keep the same binding affinity of the unmodified RNA aptamer. the 15-mer thrombin-targeted DNA that underwent UNA modifications on the loop regions showed increased thermodynamic stability. it was found that UNA substitution in the loops of the quadruplex could increase binding affinity and clotting time in blood samples. RE31 variants modified with nucleosides in UNA, LNA, or -l-RNA series exhibited prolongation of aptamer stability in human serum. 2\u2032-substitutions Modifications on the 2\u2032 position of the sugars were effective at improving the aptamer serum half-life. the 2\u2032-Fluoro (2\u2032-F), 2\u2032-amino (2\u2032-NH2) and 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-OMe) are the 2\u2032-aminopyrimidine ligands are 1000-fold more stable in 90% human serum. they bind to vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor. aptamers bind equally well to murine neovascular age-related macular degeneration. nuclease-stable 2\u2032-fluoropyrimidine-modified anti-EGFR aptamer (E07) had a strong binding affinity (KD = 2.4 nM) for the wild-type receptor, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. other 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamers (A10) had been isolated and tested for their potential treatment of human prostate cancer cells via the prostate-specific membrane antigen with a KD of 11.9 nM. two types of 2\u2032-F purine aptamers bind human neutrophil elastase (HNE) they bind HNE with reasonable affinity and the 2\u2032-F purines substituent enhanced nuclease resistance. a combination of three 2\u2032-OMe-NTPs was used in a SELEX experiment to generate an aptamer that binds to the polypeptide tissue factor pathway inhibitor. -arabino guanosines can stabilize G-quartets and maintain the quadruplex conformation. replacement of syn-guanines with 2\u2032F-arabino guanosines is not favored. -arabino guanosines can stabilize G-quartets and maintain the quadruplex conformation. the 2\u2032 F-ANA strand\u2032s structure was more compatible with the A-like structure of a hybrid duplex. the 4\u2032-thio-modified aptamer showed a high affinity (KD = 4.7 nM), with a 50-fold increase in resistance to RNase A. the modified aptamer showed a similar binding affinity to thrombin as the partially modified aptamer (KD = 7.2 nM) LNA/DNA chimera LNA5, forming a stable complex against HIV-1 trans-activating response (TAR) RNA, was synthesized from a shortened version of the hairpin RNA aptamer identified by in vitro selection against TAR. these modifications provide good protection towards nuclease digestion in bovine serum and keep the same binding affinity of the unmodified RNA aptamer. a thrombin-binding quadruplex aptamer with a UNA-modified thrombin-binding aptamer (UNA-modified TBA) was developed. it was found that UNA substitution in the loops of the quadruplex could increase binding affinity and clotting time in blood samples. the aptamers modified simultaneously with UNA and LNAs have a two-fold higher anticoagulant effect. RE31 variants modified with nucleosides in UNA, LNA, or -l-RNA series exhibited prolongation of aptamer stability in human serum. phosphorodithioate substitution on a single nucleotide of RNA aptamers improved the target binding affinity by 1000-fold. post-SELEX modifications by the addition of short phosphorothioate caps to the 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-ends of the 2\u2032-amino-modified RNA and DNA aptamers against VPF/VEGF showed high binding affinity and increased nuclease resistance. somasunderam et al. used the same protocol to isolate phosphorothioate aptamers acting as inhibitors of the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with high affinity. they also separated monothiophosphate-modified aptamers that specifically bind to CD44 with a high affinity in the range 180\u2013295 nM. the selection of a thioaptamer targeting the Dengue virus type-2 envelope (DENV-2) protein ateinternucleotide linkage at the 3\u2032-end of an oligo-2\u2032-O-methylribonucleotide containing a single methylphosphonate linkage. highly modified phosphorothioates or methylphosphonates are less stable than their partially modified counterparts. methylphosphonate derivatives were found to be more stable when the linkage modified was between adenines rather than between thymines. triazole-modified DNA aptamers with a structure similar to thrombin-inhibiting G-quadruplexes, TBA15 and TBA31, were tested for their stabilities and binding affinities. the triazole modification protected oligonucleotides from nuclease hydrolysis and increased their stabilities. modified oligonucleotides can be modified by replacing the phosphodiester linkage with methylphosphonate or phosphorothioate on the -phosphorous. the phosphorothioate modification might influence the thermal stability of the quadruplex structure in different G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides. different types of phosphorothioate aptamers have been isolated via in vitro combinatorial selection. the isolated ESTA-1 aptamer showed nuclease resistance and specifically bound to E-selectin with high affinity. the isolated ESTA-1 aptamer showed nuclease resistance and increased nuclease resistance. thioaptamer targeting the dengue virus type-2 envelope (DENV-2) protein domain III was also achieved by Gandham et al. thiophosphate ester aptamers (TA) were attached to discoidal silicon mesoporous microparticles to improve the accumulation of these carriers in infected macrophages. this thioaptamer significantly lowered the bacterial load in the lungs. highly modified phosphorothioates or methylphosphonates are less stable than partially modified counterparts, which are less stable than the partially modified parent compounds. methylphosphonate-modified 15mer oligonucleotide, known as the thrombin-binding aptamer (15TBA-M), gave a reversible and concentration-dependent thermal transition. triazole-modified oligonucleotide analogs demonstrated DNA binding affinities similar to those of unmodified oligonucleotides. the modification protected aptamers from nuclease hydrolysis and increased their stabilities. modified 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, dNTPs, were shown to be excellent substrates to be incorporated into DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. modified base aptamers are able to retain target binding properties, and thus they may enhance the binding affinity [118,119] aptamer thymidine was replaced with modified deoxyuridine with a cationic group via a methylene linker. arginine-modified dUTP was involved in an experiment to improve its enantioselectivity. SELMA selection could recognize the monoclonal antibody, 2G12, which is known to bind to mannose-rich glycans on the HIV envelope protein, gp120. 5-BzdU (5-(N-benzylcarboxyamide)-2-deoxyuridine) modification of the AS1411 aptamer might selectively increase its targeting affinity to cancer cells while having no significant influence on the normal healthy cells. a new protocol was recently described to select nucleobase-modified aptamers. it uses click chemistry (CuAAC) to introduce the favored nucleobase modification based on alkyne-modified uridine (5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU)) instead of thymidine. this new protocol enables a wide range of functionality and generates modified DNA aptamers with extended interaction properties. an advanced SOMAmer-based assay was developed for quantification of soluble glypican-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma patient samples using glypican-3 SOMAmer. the assay verified its good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision compared to the traditional antibody-based assay, with a high binding affinity. mirror image aptamers are composed of non-natural l-ribose nucleotides. an l-RNA aptamer targeting the HIV-1 trans-activation responsive (TAR) RNA was developed. NOX-G15 is a mixed DNA/RNA mirror image aptamer. a nuclease-resistant modified l-RNA aptamer (MLRA) with cationic nucleotide, 5\u2032 aminoallyl-uridine, was isolated in an in vitro selection process. this spiegelmer was capable of binding oncogenic pre-miR-19a with exceptional affinity. a cross-chemistry selective exponential enrichment (X-SELEX) approach is used. the structure shows that the Z:P pair does not greatly change the conformation of the RNA molecule nor the details of its interaction with a hypoxanthine ligand. an AEGIS aptamer that binds to an isolated protein target was outlined against an antigen from Bacillus anthracis. the aptamer showed improved stability and binding of the aptamer to its target. aptamer (cycTBA) was prepared by covalently bonding the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the linear aptamer via a linker. the thermal stability of cycTBA was highly enhanced. however, its anticoagulant activity dropped by half. such a drop is an indication of a need for some flexibility in the aptamers\u2019 structure. aptamers suffer from low affinity, which hinders their further application in diagnostics and therapeutics. multivalent DNA structures with dual aptamers showed superior intercellular uptake compared to oligomers with a single type. direct and post-insertion direct aptamer conjugation in the nanoparticle formulation is usually done by certain modifications on the aptamer structure. the results showed an 80-fold higher internalization of the TD05-micelles by Ramose cells compared to unconjugated micelles. niosome formulations showed increased antiproliferative activity when loaded with both the Ru(III)-complex and the AS1411 aptamer. the final formulation provides several medical applications, including \u201con-demand\u201d release, specific tissue/cell type targeting, in vivo imaging, and diagnosis. carbodiimide chemistry Carbodiimides are frequently used in organic synthesis, bioconjugation, and drug delivery. the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), is a common reagent used for activating carboxylic acid residues to react with ligands containing amino groups, resulting in amide bond linkage. AS1411 aptamer was conjugated onto TSL through carbodiimide chemistry. resulting liposomes exhibited much higher T1 relaxivity in MCF-7 cells. a pH-sensitive polymeric micelle using d--tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-block-poly-poly-poly-(-amino ester) was developed. carboxylated-Pluronic F127 was synthesized by the reaction of carboxylated-Pluronic F127, with amino groups at the ends of AS1411 aptamers. the same carbodiimide protocol for aptamer conjugation was adapted in developing a doxorubicin-loaded unimolecular micelle composed of hyperbranched copolymer molecules of H40 and PLA-PEG polymers with an anti-PSMA apta non-aggregated polymeric nanoconjugates of paclitaxel\u2013polylactide (Ptxl\u2013PLA) were prepared.
