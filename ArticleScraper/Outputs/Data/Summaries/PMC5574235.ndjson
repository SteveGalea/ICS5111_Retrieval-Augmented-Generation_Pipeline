{"summary": "the coronavirus MERS-CoV acute viral respiratory illness is characterized primarily by cough, fever, and shortness of breath. it is sometimes associated with severe and potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure. it was first observed in June 2012 in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. in some people, infection produces no symptoms or only mild cold-like symptoms, whereas in others, particularly in persons with underlying medical conditions, infection can produce severe illness. dynamic models are still playing important roles in describing interactions among uninfected cells, free viruses, and immune responses. model (2) represents the concentration of DPP4 on the surface of uninfected cells. it is assumed that there is no undestroyed DPP4 on the surface of infected cells. model (2) always has an infection-free equilibrium E0 = (T0, 0,0, D0) = (/d, 0,0, 1/). if R0 > 1, model (2) also has unique infected equilibrium E = (T, I, v, D), where, for 1 = 0, v = v = d(R0). for 1 > 0, v = v > 0 is the positive root of the equation 1c2v2 Nc(1 + 1)v + Ncd(R0 1) = 0, and T = d c v N d, I = c v N d 1, D = c N T, v = N 1 + 1 N 2 2 1 1 2 + 4 N 1 c d 2 1 c. if R0 = 1, all roots of f() = 0 have negative real parts. therefore, E0 is local asymptotic stability by Routh-Hurwitz criterion. dU/dt = 0(T, I, v, D), U(T, I, v, D) +. Let M be the largest subset in Q which is invariant with respect to the set model (2). it follows from the invariance of M and model (2) that E0 is globally attractive. the characteristic equation at of model (2) at E is g = 4 + a 3 3 + a 2 2 + a 1 + a 0 = 0, (8) where a 0 = T c d v 1 d 1 + D c v d 1 + D c v d 1 + c d v 1 + c d + d d 1, a 2 = T c v 1 + T d v 1 + D c 3 = a1a2a3 a12 a32a0 has 200 items in which all items are positive. therefore, E is local asymptotic stability by Routh-Hurwitz criterion. + 2 1 d T 1 d T 1 d T 1 T T D v T + d T + 1 D v T 1 D v T I I v v + 1 d 1 I v v + 1 c v N + 1 D v T + 2 D 1 D v T v 1 c v N = 2 1 d T 1 d T 1 d 1 I v v + 1 D v 1 c v N + 1 1 d 1 I 4 T T D D D D T v D d 1 I v I v I v + 1 v T D + T D T D c N = 1 d T 2 T T T T + D 2 D D D D + 1 d 1 I 4 T T D D T v D I v I v I v. x z 2 + y z 1 2 x z 2 + y 2 2 x x > 0, y 0, z 0. (13) Note that inequalities 1d/2T D(1v)2/8 0 and /2D T(1v)2/81d 0 are equivalent to the inequality 4d 12TDv2. Q = dW/dt = 0(T, I, v, D), W(T, I, v, D) +. Let M be the largest subset in Q which is invariant with respect to the set of model (2). we can also show that M = E. we can also compute the values of the infection-free equilibrium E0, the infected equilibrium E, and the basic reproductive ratio, E0 = (20,0, 0,20), E = (14.142,5.8579,1.4645,14.142), and R0 = 2 > 1. based on the numerical simulations, the condition (2da)2 1213N2 may be further weakened or even removed."}
