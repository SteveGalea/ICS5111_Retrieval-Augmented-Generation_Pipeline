{"summary": "antibody to becn1, Atg3, Atg7, and myc tag were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) other antibodies were rabbit polyclonal to green fluorescent protein (GFP; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal to GFP (Takara, Mountain View, CA), rabbit polyclonal to LC3B (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), mouse monoclonal to EBOV glycoprotein (GP) clone 4F3 EBOV GP\u2013pseudotyped VSV encoding the Luc gene was generated as described previously [17] pEYFP-C1 was purchased from Takara (Mountain View, CA) pCMV-myc-LC3 (Addgene plasmid 24919) plasmid was kindly provided by Marino Zerial. two siRNAs per gene target were tested in the EBOV infection assay. after 24 hours, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. proteins were precipitated using mouse anti-eGFP antibody. virus was added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 24 hours. the cells were then fixed and nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 dye. the effect of siRNA on gene expression was determined at the same time as infection. in -slides were preequilibrated to 14\u00b0C in a water bath. cells were incubated with virus at an MOI of 5 at 14\u00b0C for 1 hour. cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with a mouse anti-GP antibody. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 detergent. the percentage of internalized virus was determined as a ratio of puncta positive only for Alexa Fluor 633 signal to puncta positive for both. treated cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 detergent, and stained with the anti-GP antibody and rabbit anti-Ankfy1 antibody at 1:200 dilution overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells were then imaged and analyzed as described above. mouse monoclonal to EBOV glycoprotein (GP) clone 4F3 (IBT Bioservices, Gaithersburg, MD), mouse monoclonal to EEA1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), mouse monoclonal to GAPDH and rabbit polyclonal to Ankfy1 (thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) cells and Viruses Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and pcDNA3-VP40, pcDNA3-GP, p3E5E-Luc, pC-NP, pC-VP30, pC-VP35, and pC-L constructs were described previously [16, 18\u201320]. pEYFP-C1 was purchased from Takara (Mountain View, CA) siRNA-transfected cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 3 g of pCMV-myc-LC3 and 3 g of either pEYFP-Ankfy1 or pEYFP-C1. after 24 hours, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. proteins were precipitated using a rabbit anti-eGFP antibody. the effect of siRNA on gene expression was determined by immunoblotting. cells grown on slides were fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes, blocked with 5% goat serum (Thermo Fisher), stained with anti-Ankfy1 antibody overnight. images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-Eclipse microscope. Imaris software assigned a virus particle on the basis of voxel intensity. large aggregates were excluded from the analysis. EBOV Internalization Virus particles were allowed to bind to cells. cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 detergent. the secondary antibodies were Alexa Flour 488\u2013conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 633\u2013conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. cells were then imaged and analyzed as described above. depletion of LC3B caused nearly complete cessation of dextran uptake. depletion of Becn1-, Atg7-, or LC3B-depleted cells were tested. each siRNA reduced EBOV infection by at least 95%. siRNA-treated 293 cells were transfected with EBOV minigenome RNA encoding the firefly luciferase gene and plasmids encoding the virus genome replication complex proteins nucleoprotein, VP30, VP35, and L. Luciferase activity was determined 16 hours after minigenome RNA transfection. autophagy proteins control EBOV internalization Into the Cell Macropinocytosis. it is a multistage process consisting of macropinocytic cup formation and closure at the cell surface and trafficking of the resulting endosome to fuse with lysosomes or recycling back to the cell surface. the assay has a background of approximately 15% of particles being scored as internalized at time 0. autophagy proteins control internalization of EBOV into the cell. EBOV virions were allowed to bind to small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2013treated HeLa cells by incubation at 14\u00b0C for 30 minutes. samples were then transferred to 37\u00b0C for the indicated times to allow internalization. autophagy proteins are dispensable for the association between EBOV and Ankfy1 at the cell surface. autophagy proteins are dispensable for the association between EBOV and ankfy1 at the cell surface. untreated HeLa cells or those treated with nontargeting (NT) or specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting Ankfy1 were challenged with EBOV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. after 24 hours, cells were fixed, and nuclei were stained with the Hoechst dye. d at its N-terminus to myc tag (myc-LC3B) and Ankfy1 fused to EYFP (EYFP-Ankfy1) were stained with anti-myc antibody. a subset of LC3B-Ankfy1 colocalization was also observed close to the plasma membrane. EBOV localizes to LC3B-positive structures at the cell surface. samples were stained with anti-EBOV glycoprotein antibody, anti-LC3B antibody, and CellMask dye (gray) LC3B processing is not required for its association with macropinosomes. plasmids encoding myc-LC3B and EYFP-Ankfy1 colocalized both inside the cell and at the cell surface. LC3B and Ankfy1 colocalized both inside the cell and at the cell surface. LC3B-I and LC3B-II have an inherent ability to associate with Ankfy1. the lipidated form appears to be indispensable for macropinosome endocytosis. EBOV is known to use macropinocytosis for infection. LC3B-depleted cells were tested for the ability to support virus infection. each siRNA reduced EBOV infection by at least 95%. block of infection was not due to inhibition of genome replication. autophagy-associated proteins control EBOV uptake. siRNA-treated cells were incubated with virus pseudotypes bearing the EBOV glycoprotein (C) or VSV glycoprotein (D) cell depleted of Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B were challenged with pseudotyped viruses bearing the EBOV GP. EBOV uptake was synchronized by maintaining siRNA-treated cells at 14\u00b0C. a temperature known to block membrane rearrangements, including endocytic uptake, was then allowed to proceed for various periods by raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C. cells were subsequently stained with anti-GP antibody before (to detect cell surface particles) and after permeabilization with nonionic detergent. EBOV-bound cells were allowed to bind to small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2013treated HeLa cells by incubation at 14\u00b0C for 30 minutes. the samples were then transferred to 37\u00b0C for the indicated times to allow internalization. endogenous Ankfy1 peaked at 60 minutes and then dropped to 50% of peak level by 240 minutes. this is consistent with previous measurements of EBOV uptake into cells. despite lack of uptake, virus particles remained associated with macropinosomes at the cell surface. LC3B-I and LC3B-II interact with macropinosomes at the cell membrane. cells overexpressing LC3B fused at its N-terminus to myc tag (myc-LC3B) and Ankfy1 fused to EYFP (EYFP-Ankfy1) were stained with anti-myc antibody. a subset of LC3B-Ankfy1 colocalization was also observed close to microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B I (LC3B-I) and LC3B-II interact with macropinosomes at the cell membrane. cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-myc antibody (red) and cellMask dye (gray) cells treated with indicated siRNAs were transfected with plasmids encoding myc-LC3B and myc-LC3B. samples were then permeabilized and stained with anti-myc antibody (red) and cellMask dye (gray) LC3B was found exclusively near the cell surface, at the ankfy1-positive sites. the strong association seen between LC3B and Ankfy1 suggested that the 2 proteins may physically interact. to test this, cells treated with the NT siRNA or siRNA targeting Becn1, Atg7, or Atg3 were subject to coimmunoprecipitation. autophagy-regulating proteins or the pathway itself play an important role in the life cycle of numerous viruses by exerting either antiviral or proviral activity. for EBOV, the autophagy pathway is essential to establish infection in host cells. both precursor and processed forms of LC3B strongly interacted with Ankfy1 in both colocalization and immunoprecipitation assays. LC3B similarly has an affinity for macropinosomes, including those at the cell surface. over the past decade, numerous viruses, structurally and morphologically distinct, have been demonstrated to use macropinocytosis to invade cells."}
