{"summary": "the most common and also most pathogenic species, Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), causes infection with a mortality rate of approximately 90% (5\u20137). EBOV contains a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that encodes eight viral proteins. EBOV contains a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that encodes eight viral proteins. GP1 must interact with the Neimann-Pick disease type C1 protein (21\u201323), the only known fusion receptor for EBOV. GP2 undergoes a conformational change whereby the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) folds around the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) trimer. formation of the 6HB brings the virus and host membrane into close proximity, facilitating membrane fusion. prior work has led to the identification of small molecules that interact with a prefusion form of GP which likely destabilizes the complex inhibiting viral entry. no researchers have reported small molecules that target the important EBOV prehairpin intermediate (Fig. 1iii) which could prevent formation of the 6HB in a manner exploited by the FDA-approved HIV gp41 inhibitor enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) (41). a virtual screen of approximately 1.7 million compounds was conducted to a five-helix bundle model of GP2 constructed by the removal of one CHR from a high-resolution postfusion structure. the results suggest that 4 of the 11 compounds act to specifically inhibit EBOV entry after attachment but prior to virus-host membrane fusion. a large number of molecules was prioritized based on their structural and spatial similarity to the reference ligand composed of a segment of the CHR that made the most favorable interactions with our model of a GP2 five-helix bundle. however, those selected based on favorable footprint similarity have somewhat better overlap than those selected based on DCE or TS. compounds selected using a specific scoring function showed the best average score. for compounds prioritized using the DCESUM function, the scores were the lowest (1.6) and second lowest (3.9) among their respective FPSES and FPSVDW groups. 8.6 1.5 6.9 1.6 1.6 0.2 TS 20 492.3 19.4 10.7 1.6 59.1 3.1 55.6 2.2 3.5 3.1 10.5 2.5 6.8 1.0 3.7 1.9 Cum avg 83 467.3 42.5 9.5 1.8 56.2 7.8 49.3 4.6 6.9 6.5 11.5 5.4 6.3 2.4 5.0 3.8. the TS list interactions are dominated by strong VDW interactions due to their larger size (MW = 492 g/mol) the TS list interactions are dominated by strong VDW interactions due to their larger size (MW = 492 g/mol) all nine hits with activity were retained and used as starting points for identification of structurally related analogs in a secondary computational screen. a second similarity-based computational screen was conducted to explore the chemical search space around the nine initial hits. each of the hits in turn was used to rescore and rerank the top 100,000 docked molecules from the initial screen. rank ordering by pharmacophore or volume overlap yielded the same top-scored results for I01 (FMS = 1.56, VOS = 0.82) overall, the secondary virtual screen resulted in the selection of 82 additional candidates, which were evaluated for inhibition and cytotoxicity at 25 M against EBOV-pseudotyped virus. 11 compounds exhibited generally well-behaved entry inhibition compared to that of the known control inhibitor, E64, seemingly independent of cytotoxicity. activity (black) and cytotoxicity (red) are shown for the most promising 11 out of 25 compounds tested (n 2) from Fig. 3. the two most potent molecules in this assay, I01 and I49, displayed CC50 values of approximately 11 to 15 M (Table 2). all other hits had observed CC50 values of 29 M or greater. the higher the SI ratio, the more potent and the safer the compound is projected to be in vivo. the 11 compounds were assessed for inhibitory effect against the EBOV trVLP system. 8 of the 11 yielded IC50s under 5 M (Table 2). the range of SI values from the trVLP experiments was between 2.9 and 25.8, with five candidates yielding selectivity indices greater than that of E64. of the aforementioned five inhibitors, the two compounds with the largest SI values are S03 (14.3) and S58 (25.8) the three remaining compounds (I01, S29, and S31) were found to have 75%, 70%, and 77% structural similarity to a known aggregator. activity was also tested in the presence of 0.025% Tween 80. I49 was the only compound with a PAINS warning, which occurred for all three programs due to the possibility of Mannich reaction (64). despite this warning, we opted to retain compound I49 at this early stage given the fact that multiple FDA-approved drugs elicit PAINS alerts. four compounds with the least average inhibitory activity against VSV-G were I49, S29, S31, and S58. these hits showed minimal effects on cell viability. at this stage only I49, S29, S31, and S58 were selected for further characterization. compounds act with the timing of E64d in EBOV entry. time-of-addition experiments were performed with EBOV-pseudotyped virus on 293T cells. four compounds simulated, I49 and S31 maintained their DOCK-predicted poses more closely across all six simulations. the average RMSDs of I49 and S31 were less than or equal to 2.75, which is close to the typical benchmark (2.0) footprint interaction profiles were generated for each compound from the energies obtained over the MD trajectories. footprints showed striking similarity to the reference, especially in terms of the VDW profile. residues with the most favorable interactions across the candidates include (i) E564.A (5.33 2.35 kcal/mol), (ii) A568.A (3.70 0.75 kcal/mol), (iii) L571.A (3.45 0.96 kcal/mol), ( S31 interacted slightly more favorably with the EBOV five-helix bundle than I49 across multiple residues. the energies of the candidates are within one standard deviation from the means. the energy for the reference ligand is derived from a minimized X-ray pose. the two inhibitors established and maintained strong ES contacts with E564.A. the protonated nitrogen of the methylpiperidine substituent of I49 maintained water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions (25%) with the backbone and sidechain of E564.A about 32% of the time. on the other hand, S31 retained water-mediated interaction with E564.A through approximately 28% of the simulations. ioned 1,096 GP2-containing sequences to the full-genome sequence of GP2. from top to bottom the representative sequences are, by GenBank accession number, 2EBO_A (Zaire), 2EBO_A (Zaire), AHC70246 (Zaire, Mayinga 1976), YP_003815435.1 (Bundibugyo), APA16571.1 (Reston), ALL26375.1 (Sudan), and ALT footprint analysis of I49 and S31 with GP2 showed greater than 90% conservation across all 581 sequences. for Zaire in particular there was 99% conservation across all 581 sequences. experimental testing would be required to characterize the activity of the small molecules against the different viruses. a large number of molecules was prioritized based on their structural and spatial similarity to the reference ligand composed of a segment of the CHR that made the most favorable interactions with our model of a GP2 five-helix bundle. however, those selected based on favorable footprint similarity (FPS) have somewhat better overlap than those selected based on DCE or TS. compounds prioritized using the DCESUM function yielded a more favorable (lower) average DCESUM energy (65 kcal/mol) than those obtained using other functions (49 to 59 kcal/mol) molecules selected using FPSSUM resulted in a more favorable average FPSSUM score (5.5) than the other groups (7.8 to 19.1) 2.3 19.4 10.7 1.6 59.1 3.1 55.6 2.2 3.5 3.1 10.5 2.5 6.8 1.0 3.7 1.9 Cum avg 83 467.3 42.5 9.5 1.8 56.2 7.8 49.3 4.6 6.9 6.5 11.5 5.4 6.3 2.4 5.0 3.8 a Abbreviations: DCESUM (DOCK Cartesian van der Waals and electrostatic energy) the TS list interactions are dominated by strong VDW interactions due to their larger size (MW = 492 g/mol) the overlap is relatively moderate (FPSSUM = 10.5, FPSVDW = 6.8, FPSES = 3.7); future work could explore increasing the contribution of the FPS component of TS. top 25 out of 165 compounds tested against EBOV-GP-pseudotyped virus. Luminescence (top) associated with EBOV-GP-pseudotyped particle entry into 293T cells was measured and normalized by the DMSO control. cytotoxicity (bottom) was obtained by fluorescence. rank ordering by pharmacophore or volume overlap yielded the same top-scored results for I01 (FMS = 1.56, VOS = 0.82) overall, the secondary virtual screen resulted in the selection of 82 additional candidates, which were evaluated for inhibition and cytotoxicity at 25 M against EBOV-pseudotyped virus. 11 compounds exhibited generally well-behaved entry inhibition compared to that of the known control inhibitor, E64, seemingly independent of cytotoxicity. activity (black) and cytotoxicity (red) are shown for the most promising 11 out of 25 compounds tested (n 2) from Fig. 3. the two most potent molecules in this assay, I01 and I49, displayed CC50 values of approximately 11 to 15 M. all other hits had observed CC50 values of 29 M or greater. the higher the SI ratio, the more potent the compound is projected to be in vivo. the 11 compounds were assessed for inhibitory effect against the EBOV trVLP system at various concentrations. 8 of the 11 yielded IC50s under 5 M (Table 2). the range of SI values from the trVLP experiments was between 2.9 and 25.8, with five candidates yielding selectivity indices greater than that of E64. the results indicate good reproducibility between pseudotyped virus and trVLP assays, affirming the observed activity of the tested hits. the addition of detergent should lead to a decrease in activity if a compound inhibits exclusively due to colloidal aggregation. activity was also tested in the presence of 0.025% Tween 80. compounds were also subject to an evaluation for PAINS alerts using 3 distinct computational methods. I49 was the only compound with a PAINS warning, which occurred for all three programs due to the possibility of Mannich reaction (64). PubChem (65) was searched to assess if any of the compounds were previously reported as being active against multiple targets. average inhibitory activity against VSV-G and likely higher specificity for EBOV were I49, S29, S31, and S58. at this stage only I49, S29, and S58 were selected for further characterization. the four candidate molecules exhibited an activity trend similar to that of the known control E64d. the compounds act with the timing of E64d in EBOV entry. time-of-addition experiments were performed with EBOV-pseudotyped virus on 293T cells. of the four compounds simulated, I49 and S31 maintained their DOCK-predicted poses more closely across all six simulations. the average RMSDs of I49 and S31 were less than or equal to 2.75, which is close to the typical benchmark (2.0) commonly used in redocking validation tests (42), additional characterization for these compounds was performed as described further below. footprint profiles of I49 and S31 showed striking similarity to reference. footprints showed good molecular mimicry of the CHR region. I49 and S31 maintained strong contacts to a similar degree. e564.A, A568.A, L571.A, F572.A, T566.C, L569.C, and L573.C were the key GP2 residues that interact with the reference ligand, I49, and S31. the energy for the reference ligand is derived from a minimized X-ray pose. the protonated nitrogen of the methylpiperidine substituent of I49 maintained water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions (25%) with the backbone and sidechain of E564.A about 32% of the time. on the other hand, S31 retained water-mediated interaction with E564.A through approximately 28% of the simulations. 581 sequences seen in humans and nonhuman primates were retained with fragmented or complete GP sequences. from top to bottom the representative sequences are, by GenBank accession number, 2EBO_A (Zaire), 2EBO_A (Zaire), AHC70246 (Zaire, Mayinga 1976), YP_003815435.1 (Bundibugyo), APA16571.1 (Reston), ALL26375.1 (Sudan), and ALT greater than 90% conservation across all 581 sequences. 99% conservation among the subset of surveyed genomes for the five Ebolavirus species. but experimental testing would be required to characterize the activity of the small molecules against the different viruses. 165 compounds were prioritized for experimental testing. 25 of them appeared promising in an EBOV-pseudotyped virus entry assay. trVLP results correspond well with those obtained using pseudotyped virus. the hits are hypothesized to prevent the collapse of the metastable intermediate into the stable 6HB. they could also disrupt interactions with other partner proteins, the lipid bilayer, or bilayer components. additional mechanistic investigation, such as site-directed mutagenesis, could uncover important details about the fusion trigger. EBOV C-peptides showed weak or insignificant antiviral activity due to their inability to access the endosomal compartment (76) other peptide-based inhibitors include prehairpin intermediate mimics reported by Clinton et al. the majority of pairs identified as synergistic inhibitors of Ebola virus included an entry inhibitor. this suggests it is worthwhile to determine if there is synergy between the entry inhibitors identified in this work and other compounds. the identified inhibitors hypothesized to prevent formation of the critical 6HB. virtual screening was conducted for a high-resolution postfusion crystal structure of GP2 with one C-terminal heptad repeat removed (termed the five-helix bundle) to identify molecules to compete with the removed CHR, docked ligands were characterized for their ability to mimic the interaction energetic patterns (footprints) made by key CHR residues from chain C (I619.C to I626.C) with the N-terminal heptad repeat (N a three-step minimization protocol was employed to relax the coordinates using the AMBER14 sander module. 100 cycles were completed in turn with decreasing heavy-atom restraints of 1,000, 100, and 10 kcal mol1 2 respectively. the residues with the most favorable ES interactions in the energy-minimized structure include I619.C, K622.C, I623.C, and I626.C. the reference ligand was manually isolated (Chimera [88]), protonated (MOE; Chemical Computing Group), and assigned AM1-BCC charges (89, 90) to avoid artificial terminus charges due to fragmentation. the N and C termini of the reference peptide were capped with acetaldehyde (ACE) and N-methylamide groups, respectively, using tleap. 345 commercially available drug-like molecules from the ZINC database (92) were sorted according to the number of rotatable bonds. for each docked compound, the best scoring pose was retained. for each docked compound, the best scoring pose was retained. for each docked compound, the best scoring pose was retained. a second set of 82 ligands, referred to with the prefix S (secondary screen), was purchased for experimental testing. similarity was computed using the following DOCK6 scoring functions: Hungarian similarity (56), footprint similarity (83), pharmacophore similarity (93), and volume overlap. each complex underwent five equilibration steps, each 200 ps in length, with lessening restraint weights of all protein and ligand heavy atoms. for the protein, the restraint weights were (i) 10.0, (ii) 5.0, (iii) 0.1, (iv) 0.1, and (v) 0 kcal mol1 2. ligand and experimentally verified GP2 entry inhibitors were used to select key GP2 residues involved in an interaction energy. ligand RMSDs were binned based on frequency using cpptraj and plotted using Python. pCAGGS-VP30, pCAGGS-NP, pCAGGS-VP35, pCAGGS-L, p4cis-vRNA-Rluc, and pCAGGS-Tim1 were a gift from H.
