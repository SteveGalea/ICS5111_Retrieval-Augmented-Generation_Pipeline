{"summary": "the effect of asymptomatic viral infection on the dynamics of bacterial density and colonization of the nasopharynx has not been reported. the current study was performed to assess the presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. children were excluded if they had an underlying condition that was likely to alter the natural history of URTI, including asthma, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, craniofacial abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, allergic rhinitis, or chronic sinusitis. written, informed consent was secured, and assent was obtained from children 7 years of age. sufficient sample was obtained by allowing the sprayed saline to drip into the plastic bag. virology was performed on nasal samples by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. DNA was extracted from known quantities of clinical isolates of each bacterium. PCR results were expressed as colony-forming unit equivalents (CFUe) per milliliter. the same standards were used throughout the study and were internally consistent. nasal samples were obtained during 4 surveillance visits. parents were instructed to call the study nurse at the first sign of a URTI. a recovery sample was obtained at about day 15. adenovirus (A, B and C), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HK, and severe acute respiratory syndrome) nasal samples were also analyzed by means of partial sequencing to determine which RV types were present and differentiate closely related enterovirus from RV [13] a total of 279 subjects were enrolled from february 2012 to September 2015. one subject was excluded after enrollment because nasal samples could not be obtained, 205 were followed up for an entire year. 73 subjects had 1 surveillance sample taken. a virus was detected in 34% of nasal samples obtained during surveillance visits, 81% of those obtained during acute URTI visits, and 32% of those obtained during recovery visits. RV was the most common virus detected for all 3 visit types. proportion colonized was significantly higher when virus was detected than when not detected for all 3 respiratory pathogens. patients were often colonized with >1 bacterial pathogen. Streptococcus pneumoniae 178 (62; 55\u201368) 254 (47; 43\u201352) no Virus Detected (n = 288) Streptococcus pneumoniae 178 (62; 55\u201368) 254 (47; 43\u201352) a P values based on generalized estimating equation analysis Table 5. densities were significantly higher at acute URTI visits for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. bacterial densities for all 3 bacteria were significantly decreased at recovery visits compared with acute URTI visits. bacterial densities for asymptomatic visits at which a virus was detected compared with those at which a virus was not detected. at surveillance visits, the mean differences in density between these visits were 0.8, 0.4, and 0.4 log10 CFUe/mL for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae respectively. hBoV 17 1.46 (.4\u20132.51) 7 1.32 (.45\u20132.2) 8 1.22 (.21\u20132.23) CoV 59 1.79b (1.22\u20132.36) 8 0.67 (.19\u20131.14) 37 2.44c (1.9\u20132.98) FluA 7 2.17 (.57\u20133.77) 5 2.6 (1.32\u20133.98) 4 3.1 (1.55\u20134.64) FluB 9 2.18 (.80\u20133.57) 2 0.34 (.82 to 1.5) 7 we compared 4 groups: surveillance visits with no virus detected (SN), surveillance visits with virus detected (SV) and acute URTI visits with no virus detected (AN) differences were adjusted for multiple comparisons. bacterial density for all 3 pathogens was tracked over time course of a URTI. the mean observed duration for bacterial density to return to baseline levels was 13.6 days (range, 5\u201340 days) the rate of return to baseline density did not differ between URTIs by virus type detected. there were no differences in the frequency of bacterial colonization between episodes of acute URTI with virus and those without virus. bacterial density (but not colonization) was higher for symptomatic URTI visits at which a virus was detected than for surveillance visits at which a virus was detected. this suggests that increased density of pathogenic bacteria may itself be a cause of respiratory symptoms without viral coinfection. studies of otitis media and sinusitis have shown that the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx markedly increases the risk of these complications. bacterial densities increase substantially during periods of asymptomatic viral infection are important and may have clinical relevance. a cotton rat model of RSV infection showed a higher frequency of colonization of nontypable H. influenzae than non-RSV infected rats during acute RSV infection. this was not associated with changes in bacterial adherence to epithelial cells or to changes in production of specific antibacterial antibody. increased mucus production and host cell debris may enhance the nutritional milieu for bacterial growth during infection. the density and frequency of colonization with the bacterial pathogens increased during periods of symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infection. the frequency of colonization observed during asymptomatic viral infection was nearly of the same magnitude as that observed when children were symptomatic."}
