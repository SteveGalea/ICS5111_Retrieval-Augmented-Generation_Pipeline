{"summary": "influenza virus replicates in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells, type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. influenza viruses pose a constant public health concern, hence it is important to understand their pathogenesis. the trachea of mice and the distal airway tissues of humans contain basal epithelial stem cells (25) bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASC) which express both CCSP and surfactant protein C (SPC) contribute to the repair of terminal bronchioles and alveoli (15). swine are a useful large-animal model for human diseases, including lung diseases (2, 10, 26, 27) epithelial cell markers such as pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK), cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) and occludin were also expressed. the progenitor cells had the ability to differentiate into type I and II pneumocytes. the epithelial colony cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 3 min, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against one of the following antigens. the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAA) or Sambucus niagra agglutinin (SNA) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAA) or Sambucus niagra agglutinin (SNA progenitor epithelial cells were cultured in collagen I-coated dishes for 5 days in epithelial cell differentiation medium. differentiated cells were examined for expression of influenza virus receptors by immunocytochemical staining (37) za viral NP was detected at 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection by IFA using mouse anti-influenza A NP (Millipore) as primary antibody and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibody. aliquots from virus-infected cultures were also collected and titrated in MDCK cells. the epithelial colony cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 3 min, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the cells were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against one of the following antigens. cells were incubated with FITC-labeled maackia amurensis lectin II (MAA) or Sambucus niagra agglutinin (SNA) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. in vitro susceptibility of lung progenitor cells to mammalian and avian influenza viruses. avian influenza virus (AvIV; Ch/NY/95, H7N2), and human influenza virus (HuIV; Hu/OH/06, H1N1) were prepared in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (14) progenitor epithelial cells were infected with SwIV, AvIV, and HuIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. aliquots from virus-infected cultures were collected and titrated in MDCK cells aliquots from virus-infected cultures were also collected and titrated in MDCK cells. data between the two groups were compared by using a two-sided Student's t test. the expanded cells were cultured on coverslips and analyzed for the expression of stem cell- and epithelial cell-specific markers. the epithelial colony cells expressed stem cell markers Oct4 and SSEA-1. expression of Oct4 was localized in the nucleus of these cells, whereas SSEA-1 was observed on the cell surface. colony cells cultured in epithelial differentiation medium appeared flat and were larger than primary epithelial colony cells. on day 5, expression of Aqua5 protein, a marker for type I pneumocytes, was detected on 43% 15% of differentiated cells. primary undifferentiated cells did not express Aqua5 or SPC (Fig. 3C and D) the -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors were detected on the surface of progenitor epithelial cells and MDCK cells. the expression of -2,3 receptors was similar in both MDCK and lung progenitor cells. virus-infected progenitor cells replicated and produced cytopathic effects. all viral strains replicated and produced cytopathic effects in progenitor epithelial cells. TPCK-trypsin (0.5 g/ml) was added to the culture medium for the duration of the experiment. progenitor epithelial cells were first differentiated in vitro into type I and II pneumocytes and then infected with SwIV. the titer of released progeny virus was 104, 105.75, and 104.75 at 12, 24, and 48 h after infection. TPCK-trypsin was added to differentiated cell cultures. differentiated type I- and II-like pneumocytes were examined for the expression of -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors (red) progenitor epithelial cells were surrounded by mesenchymal cells. colony cells showed cuboidal morphology as described for epithelial cells. epithelial colony cells were surrounded by mesenchymal cells. helial colony cells expressed epithelial specific markers pan-CK, CK-18, and occludin (Fig. 2C to E) but not mesenchymal markers (CD29, CD44, and CD90) or hematopoietic markers (CD45). primary cell cultures were examined for the expression of stem cell markers by using specific antibodies directed against Oct4 (A) and SSEA-1 (B). cytoplasm of 46% 13% of differentiated cells indicates differentiation of primary epithelial colony cells to type II pneumocytes. primary undifferentiated cells did not express Aqua5 (C) or SPC (D) median fluorescent intensity of -2,6 receptors in MDCK and lung progenitor cells was 104,818 1,140 and 379,295 12,489 respectively. this data suggests that similarly to MDCK cells, mammalian and avian viruses might be able to replicate in swine lung progenitor cells. viral strains replicated and produced cytopathic effects in progenitor epithelial cells. viral NP protein was detected in virus-infected cells. titers increased at 24 and 48 h, followed by a slight decrease at 72 h. SD from two separate experiments using progenitor epithelial cells from two different pigs in each experiment (n = 4). we measured the replication kinetics of SwIV in the presence or absence of exogenous protease (TPCK-treated trypsin) progenitor cells were differentiated in vitro into type I and II pneumocytes and then infected with SwIV. differentiated type I- and II-like pneumocytes were cultured on collagen I-coated 24-well tissue culture plates in epithelial cell differentiation medium. differentiated type I- and II-like pneumocytes were examined for the expression of -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors (red) porcine stem/progenitor lung epithelial cells showed extensive self-renewal and differentiation potential. cells cultured in epithelial differentiation media differentiated into type I- and II-like pneumocytes. porcine cells showed extensive self-renewal properties. we were able to pass these cells at least 8 to 10 times before freezing the cell stocks in liquid nitrogen. we were also successful in expanding frozen cells in culture. exogenously administered mouse lung MSCs in SCID mouse established gap junction communications with lung alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. this secreted keratinocyte growth factor, an important modulator of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. further work is needed to determine the relationship between Oct4+ progenitor epithelial cells and MSCs. virus in our study suggests a role of pulmonary stem/progenitor cells in the apparent loss in capacity for lung repair after influenza virus infection and later phases of lung failure. at present, in vivo data demonstrating the infection of stem/progenitor epithelial cells with influenza virus are not available."}
