{"summary": "frameshifting occurs in all known organisms, from E. coli to mammals. programmed ribosomal frameshifting can result in dual-coding genes that produce alternative functional proteins. the slippery sequence is generally of the type X XXY YYZ. X denotes any nucleotide, Y denotes A or U, and Z is A, U, or C. the mRNA is thought to result in pausing of the ribosome, resulting in eventual frameshifting. posis coli (APC) mRNA in Caenorhabditis elegans is mediated by a slippery sequence A AAA AAA or A AAA AAC. alternative mechanisms may result in the production of out-of-frame proteins. frameshifting is a common mechanism to increase protein-coding capacity of small genomes. it has been proposed that frameshifting is a common mechanism to increase protein-coding capacity of small genomes such as those of viruses and mitochondria. mitochondrial gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 can shift up to 10 times within the same mRNA sequence to produce the correct gene product. ribosomal frameshifting is regulated by the end-products of spermine, putrescine, and spermidine. annexin A2 (ANXA2) can bind the pseudoknot structure of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus and reduce 1 frameshifting. other potential anti-viral agents could either specifically bind to the frameshift signal (such as antisense oligonucleotides, non-coding RNAs, or frameshift signal binding compounds) dual coding suggests that frameshifting is more common than previously thought. however, it has been proposed that frameshifting may predominantly serve to modulate RNA levels rather than produce frameshifted proteins. one possibility may be that frameshifting occurs predominantly in highly conserved, essential genes. it has been proposed that at least 1% of the human genome consists of dual coding regions. the number of out-of-frame peptides or proteins is somewhere in the range of 1\u201310% of the genome. this is a very significant fraction of the genome. experimental methods (2) can identify frameshift events that occur in vivo. most commonly, an antibody that is specific to the out-of-frame sequence of the frameshifted protein is used to detect frameshifted proteins. limits of this approach are that overexpression may result in dysregulated expression and differences in translation compared to endogenous expression levels. high throughput approaches can be applied to identify frameshifting on a genome-wide scale. such predictions are based on primary mRNA sequence stretches or on secondary hairpins or pseudo-knots within the mRNA sequence. PRFdb and KnotInFrame rely entirely on computational prediction of a combination of a slippery sequence, a spacer and pseudoknot or stem-loop structure. RECODE provides information about programmed frameshifting, read-through and bypassing, based on published results in the literature. the heptameric slippery sequence is modeled with a 1\u20138 nt spacer. the pseudoknot is identified using RNAMotif. the pseudoknot is then further confirmed with other secondary RNA-structure-prediction tools. uU A CUU UAA C CGAAAG CUU UGA C GGAUUU A/C/U UCC UGA GGGGAA C GGGUUU A/C/U UUUUUUUUU A/C/G Sequences predictive of 1 frameshifting include classical heptameric X XXY YYZ sequences and also shorter sequence stretches. FScan searches 16 nt sequences and calculates a score for aa-tRNA competition between the zero and +1 frame. a stop codon, or a rare codon in the zero frame can be a predictor of +1 frameshifting. the sequences CUU AGG C and CUU AGU U mediate +1 frameshifting of ABP140 and EST3 respectively. a 100% confidence in 1 frameshifting is reached by an unfolding force of 57 pN. an alternative is the use of single molecule Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) frameshifting can result in chimeric peptides composed of the original frame and out-of-frame sequences that can form a small or large part of the overall protein. it is possible that more than one frameshifting event takes place within the same mRNA, thus resulting in mosaic hybrid peptide sequences. the best method is to genetically ablate the expression of the frameshifted protein while preserving the in-frame sequence. the best method is to genetically ablate the expression of the frameshifted protein while preserving the in-frame sequence. this can be accomplished by gene targeting with a gene sequence that harbours multiple wobble base pair mutations or mutating the frameshift motif. an adaptation of this method using the drug harringtonine to cause ribosome accumulation at initiation codons has allowed the identification of translation start sites. 44% of detected AUG start sites were unannotated and a large fraction of these encoded out-of-frame peptides. cDNA libraries can be designed in a way that genomic fragments are inserted downstream of an AUG start codon in +1 or 1 frame so that all genomic fragments are deliberately frameshifted. however, there are limitations in such an approach, e.g., where to place the frameshift. an adaptation of this approach has been developed using fluorophores that are amenable to high-throughput screening applications. for instance, a random nucleotide sequence can be inserted between the in-frame and the out-of-frame luciferase to determine which sequence will result in high levels of out-of-frame expression. the main advantages of such a system are the broad linear range of the assay, the internal mRNA expression control (luciferase 1), the commonly searched databases by MASCOT are SwissProt, NCBInr, and EMBL EST. de novo sequence analysis by MS is based solely on the analysis of MS and MS/MS spectra. identification rates are typically lower than in classical database-based proteomics experiments. an alternative is to study peptides presented by cell-surface, class I MHC proteins. they present peptides derived from intracellular proteins to enable immune tolerance and immune surveillance. this approach identified over 200 putative programmed ribosomal frameshifting events. tInFrame X XXY YYZ Spacer 1\u20138 nt RNAmotif, pKnots, Nupack, Hotknots http://prfdb.umd.edu/ FSDB See Table 2; 63 known frameshift sequences and 190 predicted sequences. RECODE provides information about programmed frameshifting, read-through and bypassing. pknotsRG-fs compares the minimal free energy of an enforced pseudoknot structure to that of a freely folded structure such as that given by RNAfold. the slope sequence is modeled with a 1\u20138 nt spacer, and the pseudoknot is identified using RNAMotif. FSDB includes deviations from the standard X XXY YYZ slippery sequence for prediction of 1 frameshifting. +1 frameshift sequences often contain stop codons, resulting in stop codon by-passing. o.ac.nz/aef/MLOGD is a program for detection of overlapping coding sequences based on sequence alignments and analysis of mutation patterns. the limitations of this approach are that less conserved coding sequences will not be identified. -2 frame overlaps can be identified as false positives. the most commonly used frameshift reporter is a tandem luciferase construct. the downstream luciferase will be expressed only if the nucleotide stretch can mediate frameshifting. alternative reporter genes include the use of fluorescent proteins. aitken and Puglisi have used this technique to label individual tRNA molecules with donor and acceptor dyes. this technique enables to monitor relative tRNA positions and movement of tRNAs on ribosomes at a millisecond scale. it has been used to identify ribosomal translocation events on fluorescent ribosomes on immobilized RNA sequences. this will be technically difficult to implement on a genome-wide scale. frameshifting event can result in chimeric peptides composed of original frame and out-of-frame sequences. it is also possible that more than one frameshifting event takes place within the same mRNA. the best method is to genetically ablate the expression of the frameshifted protein while preserving the in-frame protein sequence. ribosome profiling methods such as Ribo-seq have been developed that allow the identification of active translation, based on sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from ribosome-protected fragments. mRNA bound to ribosomes is first cross-linked and then isolated using, e.g., sucrose gradient density centrifugation. a nuclease digestion step results in removal of mRNA sequence that is not bound (\u201cprotected\u201d) to the authors estimate that more than 1% of the genome may consist of dual-encoded regions. further improvements to the method, including deeper sequencing to get better coverage of ribosome-protected fragments, will help to identify these genes. the dual luciferase reporter construct can identify endogenous regulators of frameshifting. a similar approach could be used to identify genes that enhance or inhibit the frameshifting efficiency of this reporter. a similar approach could be used to identify genes that enhance or inhibit the frameshifting efficiency of this reporter. peptides of endogenous proteins are first detected as a mass per ion. in mass spectrometry, peptides of endogenous proteins are first detected as a mass per ion. in the most common approach, recorded masses are matched to all potential masses in the database by search algorithms like SEQUEST, MASCOT, andromeda. one problem is the \u201cbreakpoint\u201d of frameshifting, which would generate a peptide that is partially composed of the original frame and partially of the frameshifted peptide. another problem is the paucity of frameshifted peptides, as they are commonly expressed at lower levels. antizyme expression (the +1 frame) is maintained under conditions of amino acid starvation. expression of ODC (the 0 frame) is reduced in rat intestinal epithelial cells. treatment with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin also reduce 0 frame expression."}
