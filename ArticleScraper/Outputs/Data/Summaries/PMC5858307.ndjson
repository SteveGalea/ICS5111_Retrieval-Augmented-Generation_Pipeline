{"summary": "air sampling has been extensively used in research studies [1,2,3,4,5] and in specific clinical situations [6,7], it is still not routinely used in hospital infection control situations. despite there being a wide choice of air samplers either developed in-house or commercially available now [10,11,12,13,14], most infection control teams may not have access to one. the clinically relevant threshold should be for the limit of detection (LOD) of any molecular assay used to test such air samples. this is based on some of the authors\u2019 current experiments. air sampling will then draw a total air volume of: 12 L 60 min = 720 L (or 720,000 cm3 = 0.72 m3) from the environment. the air sample was collected by the SKC biosampler. this equates to 22778 copies/m3 air of RSV RNA. this is a 0.72 m3 sample of the sampled air. if the infectious dose for RSV is about 2000 RSV RNA copies/m3 air for a specific exposed population, only 30% of this detected RSV is viable then it is unlikely any secondary cases of RSV will occur. the following case report, describing a child with a chronic respiratory adenovirus (AdV), highlights several of the points raised above. the hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) team required all healthcare staff to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when managing this patient. this consisted of donning surgical masks, face visors, gloves, and gowns, each time they entered the room, whether it was for physiotherapy, educational and play periods, as well as the daily maintenance of her tracheostomy. the paediatric team were therefore concerned whether this would affect the child\u2019s psycho-social development. the manufacturer\u2019s sampling rate was fixed at 4 L/min. at the end of the sampling period, the gel filter was carefully extracted from the filter, dissolved in 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM), extracted (QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit, Qiagen, Manchester, UK) air sampling sites and durations during various activities for the patient. position 1\u2014environmental air sampling; 2\u2014during daily suctioning of the tracheostomy; 4\u2014during an educational session; 5\u2014overnight environmental air sampling. 2 range given where the NPA sampling dates fall on either side of the air sampling dates; nasopharyngeal aspirate; AdV\u2014adenovirus. air sampling was performed on the dates indicated by the vertical black arrows. despite high NPA AdV DNA levels at times, no AdV DNA was detected in any of the air samples with the same routine commercial diagnostic PCR assay. air samples are very low in pathogen genome concentration. this is a general problem with analysing air samples in metagenomic studies. the use of a routine clinical diagnostic assay may be deemed insufficiently sensitive for this purpose. one estimate for the aerosol/airborne infectious dose of influenza is about 1950\u20133000 copies of viable virus. but the actual clinical risk such lower detectable levels of virus pose are still unclear. in this patient, the fact that all the ETAs (i.e., the deeper lung samples) showed undetectable levels of AdV DNA suggests that the AdV was only present in the upper respiratory tract (URT) negative air sampling results provided additional confidence to clinical care teams that no clinically significant levels of AdV were being aerosolised into the environment. this allowed the staff to enter the room without the need to wear surgical masks and face visors. there have been no resulting adenovirus infections or outbreaks reported amongst the staff on this ward."}
