{"summary": "a major barrier is the nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure enclosing the chromatin. the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. nuclear pores are used as entry paths for most viruses that replicate in the nucleus. bud at the inner nuclear membrane and acquire a (primary) envelope, resulting in a nascent virus located in the lumen between the inner and outer nuclear membranes. the primary envelope fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, resulting in translocation of the capsid to the cytoplasm. maturation follows in the cytoplasm, and mature virions are released at the plasma membrane. in vitro, pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient to drive membrane budding and scission by forming a coat on the surface. this assay depended on an unnaturally high content (up to 40%) of negatively charged lipid headgroups on the deformed lipid bilayer that is not present on physiological membranes. however, it remains questionable to what extent itreflects the natural situation. pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient for budding and fission of membrane vesicles into the lumen of GUVs. the process is topologically identical to inwardly directed vesicle formation at the inner nuclear membrane during herpesvirus nuclear egress. pUL31 recruits pUL31 to the membrane and provides membrane anchorage, whereas pUL31 mediates membrane budding and scission. lipid mix consisted of 5 mol% cholesterol, 2.5 mol% sphingomyeline, 2.5 mol% sodium phosphatidylserine, 10 mol% sodium phosphatidylinositol, 20 mol% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 60 mol% phosphatidylcholine. soluble domain of pUL34 (amino acids 1\u2013240) was expressed from a modified pET28a vector all His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21de3 and purified using Ni-NTA. proteins were purified further by gel filtration. the pellet was resuspended in 120 l of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. the gauzes were placed in parallel (5 mm distance) into a cuvette. the gauzes were submerged in 259 mm sucrose solution. the mixture was incubated for 5 min and imaged immediately at room temperature. the cascade blue-labeled neutravidin was excited by a 405-nm diode pumped solid state laser.

EGFP and Alexa Fluor 546 were excited by an argon ion laser at 488 and 515 nm. a pinhole was set to 1 airy unit. three-dimensional reconstructions were generated using FIJI software. the excitation light of a DPSS laser at 561 nm and of an argon laser at 488 nm was reflected by a dichroic mirror. the fluorescence emission was collected by the objective and directed by spectral beam guides to photomultiplier tube detectors. images were acquired before and after adding 150 nm His6-EGFP-pUL31 or His6-EGFP on the bilayer. pUL31 was expressed from a modified pET28a vector with a His6 tag and a TEV site. pUL31 was expressed from a modified pET28a vector with a His6 tag and a TEV site. the fragment was expressed from a modified pET28a vector lacking the amino-terminal His6 sequence. reconstituted proteoliposomes were collected and pelleted for 30 min at 100,000 rpm in a TLA120.2 rotor at 4 \u00b0C. the pellet was resuspended in 120 l of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. soluble proteins were added to a final concentration of 500 nm. the mixture was incubated for 5 min and imaged immediately at room temperature. EGFP and Alexa Fluor 546 were excited by an argon ion laser. linescan analysis was performed using FIJI software (Fiji.sc/Fiji) size quantification was done by stack analysis of GUVs using a stack size of 0.5 m. supported lipid bilayers were prepared as described previously (29) images were acquired before and after adding 150 nm His6-EGFP-pUL31 or His6-EGFP on the bilayer. images were analyzed using FIJI (particle analysis) proteins were added to a final concentration of 500 nm. the soluble domain of pUL34 (amino acids 1\u2013240) was expressed from a modified pET28a vector with a His6 tag followed by a TEV site. all His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21de3 and purified using Ni-NTA. 20 l of the nuclear envelope lipid mix (30 mg/ml in 10% octylglucopyranoside) was mixed with 20 l of 2 m pUL34 or SCL1 protein and 100 l of PBS. the pellet was resuspended in 120 l of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT. an 8-well glass observation chamber was blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS. for each reaction, 50 l of freshly prepared GUVs were mixed with 150 l of PBS. the proteins and buffers used for GUV preparation matched the osmotic pressure of the sucrose solution. the nuclear envelope lipid mix was dissolved in SLB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) the suspension was then vortexed and bath-sonicated until a clear suspension was obtained. the clear solution was put in contact, at 37 \u00b0C, with freshly cleaved mica glued to a coverslip. ic Force microscopy Supported lipid bilayers were imaged using a JPK NanoWizard II system (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) intermittent contact mode images were taken using silicon nitride cantilevers (SNL-10) with a typical spring constant of 0.08 N/m and a nominal tip radius of 2 nm. the amplitude was varied during the experiment to minimize the force of the tip on the bilayer. the vast majority of these GUVs were large vesicles with no detectable membrane/vesicle structures in the interior. pUL31-pUL34 complex is sufficient to induce intralumenal vesicles. recombinant Alexa Fluor 546-labeled pUL34 (red) was reconstituted into GUVs. EGFP-pUL31 and Alexa Fluor 546-pUL34 were analyzed along the limiting GUV membrane. when added to pUL34-GUVs, purified recombinant EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membranes. pUL31 was deformed and invaginated, leading to small intralumenal vesicles inside the GUVs. cascade blue-labeled neutravidin was used as a fluid phase marker to assess permeability between the bulk solution and the pUL31-induced vesicles. when added 20 min after pUL31 addition, intra-GUV vesicles without the fluid phase marker were detected. however, the lumina of vesicles are disconnected from the bulk solution surrounding the GUVs, indicating membrane scission. pUL31-pUL34 recruitment was sufficient for intralumenal vesicle formation. pUL31-pUL34 recruitment was sufficient for intralumenal vesicle formation. this indicates that an authentic transmembrane region is not essential for this process. an Alexa Fluor 546-labeled N- or C-terminally His6-tagged pUL34 fragment was bound to 1% Ni-NTA-DGS-containing GUVs. addition of EGFP-pUL31 induced intra-GUV vesicles. a fraction of pUL34 is causative for in vitro vesicle formation. the pUL34 fragment is only located on the outer leaflet of the GUVs. the experiments shown here exclude that a fraction of pUL34 is causative for invagination. the function of pUL34 in this minimal system is to target pUL31 to the membrane. pUL31-pUL34-mediated Membrane Resculpting Requires Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin. pUL31-pUL34-mediated Membrane Resculpting Requires Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin. cholesterol and sphingomyelin are required for intra-GUV vesicle formation. it is possible that cholesterol and sphingomyelin are required for intra-GUV vesicle formation. recombinant Alexa Fluor 546-labeled pUL34 was reconstituted into GUVs. pUL31 membrane recruitment induces vesicle formation on membranes. many membrane remodelling proteins, such as clathrin or components of the COP I/II, oligomerize on the membrane. pUL31-mediated membrane recruitment of EGFP-pUL31 and formation of intra-GUV vesicles. cascade blue-labeled neutravidin was added as a fluid phase marker 20 min after protein addition to GUVs. his6-EGFP-pUL31 was recruited rapidly to the supported lipid bilayers. it formed patches of 1.0 0.5 m in diameter and eventually provoked multiple defects. this latter effect is likely due to the increase in membrane tension associated with the membrane deformations at the pUL31 assembly sites. bilayers are disrupted upon addition of His6-EGFP-pUL31 (green) pUL31 forms 1.2 0.2 m patches that grow over time. the bilayer is destroyed and lipid aggregation is seen over this period of time. pUL31 forms clusters when recruited to membranes. pUL31-pUL34 complex is sufficient to induce intralumenal vesicles. recombinant Alexa Fluor 546-labeled pUL34 (red) was reconstituted into GUVs. addition of EGFP-pUL31 (green in overlay) induced formation of intra-GUV vesicles. EGFP-pUL31 and Alexa Fluor 546-pUL34 were analyzed along the limiting GUV membrane. pUL31-pUL34 membrane was deformed and invaginated, leading to small intralumenal vesicles inside the GUVs that contained both pUL31 and pUL34. fluid phase marker was added as a soluble probe, together with pUL31, to pUL34-GUVs. when added 20 min after pUL31 addition, intra-GUV vesicles without the fluid phase marker were detected. this is consistent with the three-dimensional reconstitution of an EGFP-pUL31-treated pUL34-GUV. pUL31-pUL34-mediated vesicle budding and scission is consistent with a role in this process. to assess whether the membrane-spanning C terminus of pUL34 is required for the formation of intralumenal vesicles, we artificially recruited a fragment lacking its transmembrane domain to GUVs. this finding is consistent with the fact that the transmembrane region of pUL34 is not required for intralumenal his6-tagged pUL34 fragment comprising the soluble domain (amino acids 1\u2013240) was directly bound to Ni-NTA-DGS-containing GUVs. Membranes were stained with DiDC18. the pUL34 fragment is only located on the outer leaflet of the GUVs. the experiments shown here exclude that a (wrongly oriented) fraction of pUL34 is causative for in vitro vesicle formation. pUL31 was induced efficiently induced by his6-tagged EGFP. pUL31-pUL34-mediated Membrane Resculpting Requires Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin. EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membrane of pUL34-GUVs regardless of lipid composition. pUL31-pUL34-mediated Membrane Resculpting Requires Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin. recombinant pUL34 was reconstituted into GUVs containing the nuclear envelope lipid mix or the same lipid mix lacking either cholesterol (chol), sphingomyelin (SM), the negatively charged phospholipids phosphoinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PS), or both (PI+PS). formation of intralumenal vesicles was induced and quantified. pUL31 membrane recruitment induces vesicle formation on GUVs. many membrane remodelling proteins, such as clathrin or components of the COP I/II or ESCRT machinery, oligomerize on the deforming membrane. EGFP-pUL31 was eluted with protease-containing buffer. his6-pUL31 was recruited rapidly to the supported lipid bilayers. the protein formed patches of 1.0 0.5 m. pUL31 forms patches on supported lipid bilayers. a, supported lipid bilayers (SLB) mimicking the nuclear envelope lipid composition. pUL31 forms 1.2 0.2 m patches that grow over time. after 40 s, particles fuse and can no longer be analyzed. pUL31 and pUL34 are necessary for nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids. pUL34 (red) was stained with lipophilic dye DiDC18. EGFP-pUL31 (green in overlay) induced formation of intra-GUV vesicles. recombinant proteins employed were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. purified recombinant EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membranes. in the presence of pUL31, the GUV membrane was deformed and invaginated. in typically sized GUVs with a diameter of 30\u201340 m, 15 intralumenal vesicles were detected. soluble probe, together with pUL31, was found in intralumenal vesicles. when added 20 min after pUL31 addition, intra-GUV vesicles without the fluid phase marker were detected. this is consistent with the three-dimensional reconstitution of an EGFP-pUL31-treated pUL34-GUV that shows highly mobile vesicles distant. pUL31-pUL34-mediated vesicle budding and scission in detail. membrane-spanning C terminus of pUL34 is required for formation of intralumenal vesicles. soluble domain (amino acids 1\u2013240) of pUL34 was fused to an N- or C-terminal His6 tag. Membranes were stained with DiDC18. the purity of the employed recombinant proteins is shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. pUL34 fragment is only located on the outer leaflet of the GUVs. a fraction of pUL34 is causative for in vitro vesicle formation. pUL31-pUL34-mediated membrane tethering is sufficient for invaginations. EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membrane of pUL34-GUVs regardless of lipid composition. in the absence of both negatively charged lipid classes, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intralumenal vesicles formed efficiently. both lipids interact and are crucial for lateral segregation of membrane components, leading to membrane subdomain formation. pUL31 was added to pUL34-GUVs loaded with membrane dyes naphthopyrene and DiDC18. pUL34 was reconstituted into GUVs containing the nuclear envelope lipid mix. the same lipid mix lacking either cholesterol (chol), sphingomyelin (SM), the negatively charged phospholipids phosphoinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PI+PS) pUL31 membrane recruitment induces vesicle formation on membranes. many membrane remodelling proteins, such as clathrin or components of the COP I/II or ESCRT machinery, oligomerize on the deforming membrane (22, 23). to test for membrane-induced oligomerization, we bound limiting amounts of His6-pUL31 to Ni-NTA-DGS GUVs. eluting EGFP-pUL31 was eluted with protease-containing buffer. his6-EGFP-pUL31 was recruited rapidly to the supported lipid bilayers. the protein formed patches of 1.0 0.5 m in diameter. pUL31 disrupts supported lipid bilayers. a, supported lipid bilayers (SLB) mimicking the nuclear envelope. pUL31 and pUL34 are necessary for nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids. pUL31-pUL34 complex is sufficient to induce intralumenal vesicles. recombinant Alexa Fluor 546-labeled pUL34 was reconstituted into GUVs. labeled pUL34 or the inner nuclear membrane protein SCL1 were reconstituted into GUVs (red) addition of EGFP-pUL31 (green in overlay) induced formation of intra-GUV vesicles on pUL34 but not SCL1. -pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membranes. in the presence of pUL31, the membrane was deformed and invaginated. in typically sized GUVs with a diameter of 30\u201340 m, 15 intralumenal vesicles were detected. intra-GUV vesicles without the fluid phase marker were detected 20 min after pUL31 addition. this is consistent with the three-dimensional reconstitution of an EGFP-pUL31-treated pUL34-GUV that shows highly mobile vesicles distant and apparently detached from the limiting GUV membrane. membrane-spanning C terminus of pUL34 is required for intralumenal vesicles. soluble domain (amino acids 1\u2013240) of pUL34 fused to an N- or C-terminal His6 tag was added to GUVs. pUL31 recruitment was sufficient for intralumenal vesicle formation. Membranes were stained with DiDC18. the purity of the employed recombinant proteins is shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. a fraction of pUL34 is causative for in vitro vesicle formation. pUL31-pUL34-mediated Membrane Resculpting Requires Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin The GUVs used so far contained a lipid composition resembling the nuclear envelope. EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membrane of pUL34-GUVs regardless of lipid composition. in the absence of both negatively charged lipid classes, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intralumenal vesicles formed efficiently. pUL34 was reconstituted into GUVs containing the nuclear envelope lipid mix. the same lipid mix lacking either cholesterol (chol), sphingomyelin (SM), the negatively charged phospholipids phosphoinositol (PI) or phosphatidylserine (PI+PS) limiting amounts of EGFP-pUL31 devoid of a His6 tag resulted in recruitment of the protein to the membrane and induction of intralumenal vesicle formation. pUL31 self-interacts on membranes but not in solution. EGFP-pUL31 was eluted with precision protease-containing buffer. his6-EGFP-pUL31 was recruited rapidly to the supported lipid bilayers. pUL31 disrupts supported lipid bilayers. a, supported lipid bilayers (SLB) mimicking the nuclear envelope. the bilayer is destroyed. pUL31 forms clusters when recruited to membranes by pUL34. it self-interacts to induce membrane deformation, leading to vesicle formation. nuclear egress is a common mechanism for herpesvirus nucleocapsid translocation through the nuclear envelope (41) the presence of pUL31 at the membrane is sufficient to induce GUV-internal vesicles, indicating that, in this system, pUL34 is only required to recruit pUL31 to the membrane. pUL31-pUL34-mediated membrane deformation at the inner nuclear membrane can be uncoupled and is functionally disconnected from lamina disassembly. pUL31 and pUL34 have well defined and separate functions in the primary envelopment of herpesvirus capsids. coexpression of both proteins in uninfected cells induces the formation and scission of vesicles from the inner nuclear membrane (10, 20). pUL31 membrane recruitment is sufficient for membrane remodelling, resulting in vesicle formation. pUL34 is dispensable for membrane restructuring leading to vesicle formation. helix insertion has to take place in the outer lipid leaflet of the vesicle. pUL31 is localized in the interior of the vesicle to increase the outer. can curve membranes (52), can be excluded for pUL31-mediated membrane budding. this mechanism generates membrane curvature and induces scission. phase separation can generate membrane curvature and induce budding. a pUL31-pUL34 complex lacking the pUL34 transmembrane domain forms ordered assemblies when recruited to membranes. a double point mutation in pUL34 causes a blockage in nuclear envelope vesicle formation without preventing pUL31 membrane recruitment. the defect of pUL31 (D35A/E37A) during infection could be overcome by a mutation in pUL31 that restored the ability to induce membrane deformation (61). pUL34 may undergo a conformational change upon pUL31 binding. it either brings the protein closer to the membrane or triggers multimerization of the complex. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III complexes direct membrane budding away from the cytosol, and ESCRT-III cleaves bud necks from their cytosolic faces. we did not detect a regular structural pattern on the membrane surface. this suggests that pUL34 is required for formation of the hexagonal arrangement. the vesicles observed in the in vitro system are considerably larger than the vesicles formed in the nuclear envelope lumen during viral egress. pUL34-mediated membrane recruitment of pUL31 drives vesicle budding and constriction in a biochemically well defined system. it shows that a single protein, pUL31, is sufficient to induce inwardly directed membrane deformation and scission."}
