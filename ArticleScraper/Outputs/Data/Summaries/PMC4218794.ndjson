{"summary": "the world health organization estimates that seasonal influenza results in up to five million cases of severe illness and 500,000 deaths annually. more severe disease is more often seen among persons aged >65 years, infants, pregnant women, and individuals of any age with underlying health conditions. hypercytokinemia was observed in humans infected with influenza virus A/H5N1. innate immune responses suggest pro-inflammatory mediators are contributing to disease pathogenesis, with elevated blood levels of IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, and sIL-2R observed in patients. patients were tested for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 1\u20133, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, enterovirus and adenovirus in nasal swabs and for dengue virus 1\u20134, human parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, and Epstein Bar virus in EDTA blood. the time point of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sampling was regarded as acute disease, defervescence the inclusion criteria of this study were: age 1 year, duration of illness 10 (non-H5N1) or 14 (H5N1) days, (iii) positive result for influenza virus A or B using a rapid antigen test or qualitative reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a respiratory specimen. subjects infected with avian influenza virus A/H5N1 were enrolled with any degree of severity. samples of moderate and severe influenza patients were collected from a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized control trial of standard dose (75 mg bd or pediatric equivalent) versus double dose (150 mg bd or pediatric equivalent) raw gene expression intensity data was exported from the GenomeStudio software. data normalization All datasets were normalized by using R (http://www.bioconductor.org) data was log10 transformed before Z score transformation was performed. valescent samples from patients with severe influenza, a two class-unpaired test was used. the IPA database contains canonical pathways and functional gene relationships expertly-curated from the literature. whole-blood profiling was performed on all samples from both groups at 72 h after fever onset, at 3\u20138 days and 3\u20134 weeks after self-reported fever onset. the time point was regarded as acute disease, defervescence and convalescence. subjects infected with avian influenza virus A/H5N1 were enrolled with any degree of severity. the exclusion criteria were: pregnancy or urine -hCG positivity, (ii) breast feeding, (iii) prior oseltamivir therapy for >72 hours duration or double dose (any duration) within the past 14 days. the study took place across five hospitals in Vietnam, three hospitals in Indonesia, four hospitals in Thailand, and one in Singapore. the primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of subjects with no detectable viral RNA in respiratory swabs at day 5 as measured by RT-PCR. subjects infected with avian influenza virus A/H5N1 were enrolled with any degree of severity. the exclusion criteria were: pregnancy or urine -hCG positivity, (ii) breast feeding, (iii) prior oseltamivir therapy for >72 hours duration or double dose (any duration) within the past 14 days, (iv) allergy or severe intolerance of oseltamivir. whole-blood (2.5 ml) from PAXgene RNA tubes was extracted using paxgene RNA kits (Qiagen, Sussex, UK) biotinylated amplified cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) technology. after purification, 2 g of cRNA was hybridized to an Illumina HumanRef-12 V4 BeadChip containing probes to more than 29,000 gene transcripts. Z score transformation calculate the number of standard deviations a particular data point is form the mean. at low intensities, where data is much more variable, false positive rate could increase. 84 patients were infected with influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 (Influenza A H1N1 pandemic 2009), pre-2009 seasonal A/H1N1, H3N2 virus, rhinovirus, or co-infected with seasonal H1N1 virus. the other 83 were all pathogen-negative patients during the same time interval and were designated as the OFI group.

of 11 patients. for severe patients, we performed unpaired SAM test instead of paired SAM test in order to avoid losing samples. genes in IL-1 signaling, IL-22 signaling, Production of Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages and p38 MAPK signaling were only up-regulated in moderate and severe patients. the interferon signaling pathway was highly up-regulated in moderate (P =
