{"summary": "influenza can occur every couple of years, and can lead to complications ranging from pneumonia to severe respiratory failure. young children, the elderly, and people with chronic underlying conditions are particularly vulnerable to the complications of influenza. influenza vaccines prepared for intramuscular use and based on traditional inactivated viruses (TIVs) have been available for more than 50 years, although the first preparations based on whole viruses have been replaced by subunit and split-virus vaccines. a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has also been registered. this contains cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated influenza viruses. a LAIV does not have to be injected because it is administered intranasally. it can lead to a more substantial immune response and provide protection against mismatched strains. more than 3000 articles were found, but only papers published in English. preterm neonates and infants Influenza is not a frequent illness in newborns. it may cause considerable morbidity and even mortality during the neonatal period. in a recent study of 652 infants hospitalized because of influenza, 82 (13%) were admitted to an NICU [Yen et al. 2012]. a total of 27 (35%) of the hospitalized infants were preterm and most of them were affected by CLD of prematurity (92%). a large-scale multicentre surveillance study estimated the rates of hospitalization due to seasonal influenza. preterm infants aged at least 6 months have significant hypogammaglobulinemia during the first year of life. two doses of influenza vaccine one month apart can induce protective concentrations of influenza-specific antibodies in preterm infants aged 6\u201311 months. colleagues found that influenza A/H1N1/2009 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine evoked a significant immune response in 105 children aged 6\u201323 months. the data confirm that influenza vaccination is immunogenic and safe even in preterm infants. there is an urgent need for further research in a number of areas. the pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus has been associated with severe lung injury in patients with asthma. more than 30% of the children suffering an asthma attack due to the virus were diagnosed as having pneumonia, required admission to an intensive care unit, needed mechanical ventilation or died. pediatricians tend to resist influenza vaccination because of the lack of convincing evidence concerning its efficacy in preventing asthma exacerbations. some studies have evaluated the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in relation to steroid therapy. a large-scale study found that the immune response to influenza A antigens was similar in patients receiving no or low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and those receiving medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. in the u.s., a LAIV is approved for use in children with mild-to-moderate asthma. further studies are needed to confirm its safety in severe asthma. a future action needs to be taken to increase influenza vaccination coverage. more recent studies have not found any evidence that influenza is more frequent in patients with CF than in healthy subjects. two other studies have confirmed the limited role of influenza in respiratory exacerbations in children with CF. the impact of pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza is also unclear. in 2009, 91.2% of the children with CF in Italy were vaccinated against influenza versus 8.3% in the 2000\u20132001 season. coverage in france has been relatively stable but is less than in other countries. 91% of the children with CF in the united states were vaccinated in the 2006\u20132007 season. influenza vaccines seem to be immunogenic and safe in patients with CF. there is a lack of specific studies evaluating the impact of influenza on respiratory exacerbations in patients with these disorders or the benefits of vaccination. choalveolar lavage, de Schutter and colleagues found a viral infection in 30.4%, with a high prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza and para-influenza viruses. another study of 80 children with recurrent lower respiratory infections detected viral genomes in 62.5%. this misuse may promote the growth of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, which is becoming a major threat to treatment efficacy. children at high risk of respiratory disease are a heterogeneous group of the pediatric population. there are few studies assessing the impact of influenza on respiratory exacerbations or the efficacy of influenza vaccine in such patients. however, no specific studies of their efficacy have been carried out. patients Knowledge Main gaps Preterm neonates and infants Regardless of chronic lung disease of prematurity, these patients have a significant risk of influenza-related complications. influenza vaccines are immunogenic and safe in such patients To establish the best means of increasing influenza vaccination coverage in their household contacts."}
