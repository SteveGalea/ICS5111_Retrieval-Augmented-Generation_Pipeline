{"summary": "paper-based sensors are widely used in viruses, antigens, and pollutant detection systems. however, most studies focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage conditions. paper-based platform first, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/mL aliquots of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody were loaded on a Piezo printhead inkjet printer. the printed IgG-HRP antibodies on paper-based membranes were then incubated with the HRP substrate, and the HRP signal intensity was recorded. the chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed on both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day 1.3 and day 2.5. storage temperature does not induce >10% changes in the signal for nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes. chemiluminescence intensity profile from printed (C) PSMA and (D) TNF- Printed PSMA and TNF- were stored at r.t., 4, or 20 \u00b0C for 28 days. chemiluminescence signal intensities from antibody-HRP were monitored. each experiment was performed in triplicate, and values are expressed as the mean SD. data suggest that IgG-HRP antibodies were successfully printed on paper-based membranes. data suggest that the signal intensity from IgG-HRP printed on printing paper decreased by half on days 56.3 and 57.1. the chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed on both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day 1.3 and day 2.5. chemiluminescence intensity profile from printed (C) PSMA and (D) TNF- Printed PSMA and TNF- printed on printing paper showed the highest signal intensity from antibody-HRP. the time to reach half intensities of the initial signal was the longest for the PVDF membrane followed by printing paper and nitrocellulose membrane. chemiluminescence profile from printed PSMA on (A) printing paper, (B) nitrocellulose, and (C) PVDF and from TNF- on (D) printing paper, (E) nitrocellulose, and (F) PVDF membrane. each experiment was performed in triplicate, and values are expressed as the mean SD. signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t. however, 4 and 20 \u00b0C significantly increased printed protein stability and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50% up to 60 days. print proteins can be detected by detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures. it took 3 days for signals to be reduced to half of initial intensity from printed proteins on printing paper. storing at 20 \u00b0C increases printed protein stability after 7 days of storage. protein and antibodies printed on simple printing paper can be stable up to several months upon storage at low temperature. results can be further applied to developing a simple and cost-effective antigen/virus/pollutant test based on paper membranes. 1 mL of ECL western blotting detection reagents and the ImageQuant LAS 500 system (GE Healthcare) were used to record chemiluminescence intensity from printed IgG-HRP. chemiluminescence intensity from printed IgG-HRP was monitored for printed IgG-HRP stability. antimouse IgG-HRP antibody was purchased from Hankuk Paper (Seoul, Republic of Korea) recombinant human PSMA protein was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). anti-TNF- antibody-HRP was purchased from abcam. paper-based sensors of PSMA and TNF- PSMA and TNF- PSMA (1\u2013100 g/mL) and TNF- recombinant proteins in molecular biology grade water were printed on paper-based platforms and stored at three different conditions for 1\u2013180 days."}
