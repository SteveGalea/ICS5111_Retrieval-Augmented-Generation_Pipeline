{"summary": "IBV is a member of the Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. its genome consists of a 27.6 kb single stranded positive-sense RNA molecule. the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [3,4]. Oligonucleotides were designed based on consensus sequence of the following IBV strains: Cal 99 [GenBank:AY514485], Mass 41 [GenBank:AY851295] and BJ [GenBank:AY319651] overlapping primers were designed in a manner such that each pair of primer covered approximately two kb of genome. Florida, AY392050; CU-T2, AY561724; Ark 99, AY392051; de072, AY392054;GA98, AY392053; Gray, AY392066. complete structural genes: HK, AY761141; Vic, DQ490221; KB8523, M21515; TW2296/95, DQ646404; b) S1: Jilin, AY8391 the genome of Ark DPI consists of 27,620 nucleotides (nts) excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5' (528 nts) and 3' (507 nts) untranslated regions (UTRs) IBV polyprotein is cleaved into 15 cleavage products. first two N-terminal products are cleaved by PLpro and rest of the C-terminal products are cleaved by 3CLpro. the putative domains and their cleavage sites are predicted by comparison of amino acid sequences of each non-structural protein (nsp) of Ark DPI with those of IBV-Beaudette. % nucleotide identity of Ark DPI non-structural genes and ORF1ab, ORF2-6. complete genome with other IBV strainsa, b, c IBV Strains. letters b NA-not analyzed c Parental strains of Ark DPI are shown in bold letters and immediate derivative of Ark DPI is indicated by asterisk (*).
