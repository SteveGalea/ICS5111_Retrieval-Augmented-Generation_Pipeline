{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped viruses that have a single-stranded RNA genome. the large (L) segment encodes the matrix protein (Z) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. the small (S) segment encodes the nucleoproteins (NPs) and glycoproteins (GP). arenaviruses have been separated into two genera on the basis of their natural reservoir hosts. a study in the Republic of Guinea showed a link between the consumption of contaminated food as a risk for rodent-to-human transmission. there are no clinically approved vaccines for LASV; the antiviral drug ribavirin is the only treatment available for LASV infection. there are no clinically approved vaccines for LASV; the antiviral drug ribavirin is the only treatment available for LASV. the prototypic arenavirus Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus is genetically and biologically diverse. LCMV-ARM is highly adapted for infection in murine models. LCMV-WE has limited passage history in mice and tissue culture models. infected NHPs were challenged with lethal doses of LCMV-WE intravenously, the animals did not succumb to LF-like disease. epithelial tissue are among the first host cells to come in contact with the viruses. the role of epithelial barriers on infection has been investigated extensively with a number of other viruses. cells were infected with LCMV-Armstrong (strain 53b), LCMV-WE (strain 54), mopeia virus (MOPV, strain AN20410), or the Mopeia/Lassa reassortant virus, clone ML-29. titers were determined using a standard plaque assay with minor modifications. polarization of Caco-2 cells and Infection of Polarized Cells. cells were seeded on 24-well plate transwell inserts. cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. proteins were analyzed with western blot (WB) and qRT-PCR. pre-made primers/probe sets against human ZO-1 (Hs01551861) and Occludin (Hs00170162) were purchased from ThermoFisher. monoclonal antibody against zonal occludin-3 was used at a 1:100 dilution. antibody clone 11H6C4 recognizing fully glycosylated -DG was used at a 1:100 dilution (Milipore, cat. # 05-593, Billerica, MA, USA) primer and probe targeting LCMV-WE L segment: Forward (5\u2032 CCT TAA AGA GGT GAG AGC ATG A), reverse (5\u2032 TTTCATTGATATTCTTGGTTAGGTG) and probe (5\u2032 CAGCCACACCTGTTAGGTG) the attachment of viral particles was assessed quantitatively via the Ct method. cells were infected with LCMV-Armstrong (strain 53b), LCMV-WE (strain 54), mopeia virus (MOPV, strain AN20410), or the Mopeia/Lassa reassortant virus, clone ML-29. titers were determined using a standard plaque assay with minor modifications. 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min was stained with 1% crystal violet solution. 0.04% neutral red, 0.5% agarose, 5%FBS solution was added to wells after 4 days incubation. both plaque assays have a limit of detection of approximately 80 PFU/mL. polarized Caco-2 cells were grown apically on 12-well, 0.45 M Transwell inserts. cells were then fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 20 min. monoclonal antibody against zonal occludin-3 was used at a 1:1600 dilution. antibody clone 11H6C4, recognizing fully glycosylated -DG, was used at a 1:100 dilution. transwell filters were cut out and placed on microscope slides. qRT-PCR was used to quantitate attached viral particle. primers and probe targeting LCMV-WE L segment: Forward (5\u2032 TCCTCAATTAGGCGTGTGTGAA), Reverse (5\u2032 TACACATCCTTGGGTCCTCTGAA) and probe (5\u2032 CAGCCACACCTGTTAGGTG) polarized Caco-2 cells were seeded for apical infection (top) or basolateral infection (below) and polarized for 21 days. the cells were either Mock infected with PBS, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-Armstrong, LCMV-WE, ML-29, Mopeia (MOPV), or Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus (vaccine strain the OW arenaviruses used in this study did not negatively affect electric resistance of epithelial monolayers during the 5-day observation period. the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) strain TC-83 readily disrupted the integrity of polarized Caco-2 cells. caco-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and polarized for 2 weeks. peak viral titers were approximately 2-log lower than those for LCMV or MOPV. polarization of Caco-2 cells does not significantly impact replication kinetics. polarized Caco-2 cells were polarized on 0.4 m Transwell inserts in apical or basolateral orientation, for 21 days. TEER was measured regularly, and the apical and basolateral supernatants were collected every 24 h for a period of 5 days. however, basolateral release of infectious virus particles was observed at later times post infection. polarized Caco-2 cells apically infected with ML-29 failed to produce detectable virus particles from the basolateral surface. the release of infectious ML-29 progeny were temporally delayed during basolateral infections, and resulted in the formation of low viral titers. values shown are the means of 3 biological replicates with the error bar representing the standard deviation of the mean. if viral PFUs were not observed, data received a place-holder value to signify samples were tested. # indicates that one or more biological replicates was below limit of detection. polarized Caco-2 cells were infected at an equal MOI (0.3 PFU/Cell) cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus to attach. the total RNA was extracted from unwashed tissue culture cells of at least three biological replicates. polarized Caco-2 cells were polarized on 0.4 m Transwell inserts for 21 days in either apical or basolateral orientation. cells were then infected with an MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell of LCMV-Arm (A); LCMV-WE (B); ML-29 (C); or MOPV (D) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus to attach to epithelial cells, but not enter the cells. LCMV-Arm has a ratio of apical and basolateral attachment of approximately 1.5. ratio of basolateral and apical attachment indicates that LCMV-WE and MOPV attachment is more or less equivalent in its binding to the apical and the basolateral surfaces of the cells. however, the ratio of basolateral and apical attachment of ML-29 indicates that there is a large difference between viral attachment between the two surfaces. polarized Caco-2 cells were seeded for apical infection (top) or basolateral infection (below) after which the cells were either Mock infected with PBS, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-Armstrong, LCMV-WE, ML-29, Mopeia (MOPV) or Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus (vaccine strain TC-83) at an MOI this study did not negatively affect electric resistance of epithelial monolayers during the 5-day observation period. in contrast, the alphavirus strain TC-83 readily disrupted the integrity of polarized Caco-2 cells. no significant change in quantity of tight junction proteins was observed in infected cells as compared to mock infected. caco-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and polarized for 2 weeks. supernatants were collected every 24 h for a 72 h period. virus production was determined via standard plaque assay. polarized Caco-2 cells were exposed to LCMV-Arm and LCMV-WE. infection resulted in roughly the equivalent release of infectious particles. LCMV-Armstrong and LCMV-WE show similar patterns of entry and release. polarized Caco-2 cells apically infected with ML-29 failed to produce detectable virus particles from the basolateral surface. a 2-3-fold difference between viral apical and basolateral release during apical ML-29 infections of polarized Caco-2 cells. polarized Caco-2 cells were polarized on 0.4 m Transwell inserts in apical or basolateral orientation, for 21 days. the cells were infected with MOPV, at an MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell on either the apical (A) or basolateral (B) side. polarized Caco-2 cells were infected at an equal MOI (0.3 PFU/Cell) cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus to attach. the total RNA was extracted from unwashed and washed tissue culture cells of at least three biological replicates. the relative abundance of viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR. caco-2 cells were polarized on 0.4 m Transwell inserts for 21 days. cells were then infected with an MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell of LCMV-Arm (A); LCMV-WE (B); ML-29 (C); or MOPV (D) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. after 1 h, cells were either unwashed (input) or washed. LCMV-ARM, LCMV-WE, and MOPV all attach to some degree on the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells. however, the ratio of basolateral and apical attachment of ML-29 indicates that there is a large difference between viral attachment between the two surfaces. ML-29\u2019s preference for the apical side of the polarized Caco-2 cells is significantly different than that of LCMV and MOPV. infection with identical titers showed a variable outcome, ranging from no signs and symptoms to fatal, LF-like disease with elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (ALT/AST) levels. elevated levels are associated with lethal LF disease of humans in endemic regions. model recapitulates the infection of intestinal epithelial cells from the luminal and laminal sides of the epithelial monolayer via the apical and basolateral surfaces. ML-29 expresses GP1 attachment glycoprotein identical to LASV GP1 and MOPV, attenuated genetic relative of LASV. ML-29 was developed as a potential vaccine for the prevention of LASV infection. if after successful attachment following the ingestion of viral particles fails to release viral particles basolaterally, this may be an exceptionally potent tool for the development of successful immunity against LASV in at-risk populations. rLCMV-LASVGP showed preferential entry into polarized Caco-2 cells. rLCMV-LASVGP studies did not elucidate the viral release patterns of rLCMV-LASVGP in polarized Caco-2 cells. -DG was detected basolaterally in polarized Caco-2 cells. but ML-29\u2019s binding efficiency was low. this may be due to differences and mutations that ML-29 may contain as compared to WT LASV. intestinal epithelial cells may not be the sole determinant of viral pathogenesis. differences between prototypic arenavirus LCMV and the surrogate model of LASV interaction, ML-29, were observed in both attachment efficiency and viral entry and egress from polarized intestinal epithelia."}
