{"summary": "the available vaccines against IBV cannot cover new variants. garlic extract had inhibitory effects on IBV in the chickens embryo. allium sativum, garlic in English, belongs to the Alliaceae family. it has different minerals such as Ca, Fe, K, Cu and Mg. it contains variety of vitamins and minerals. chitis due to IBV, no certain treatment exists. removal of cold stress, high-quality air and management factors can help to control this disease. vaccination in some region is not impressively effective. each group that was inoculated with Intervet 4/91 and M41 contained 28 eggs. each group was treated by the mixture of several dilutions of intervet 4/91 (10-2 to 10-6) and constant amount of garlic extract contained 20 eggs. all embryos in 10-2 and half of the embryos in 10-3 dilution of virus died. at the end of the 4th day, the remaining embryos at 10-3 dilution of virus died. treatment with garlic extract 8 hours after exposure to intervet4/91. no significant evidence of embryo death was seen compared to the group treated only with intervet 4/91. in 10-2 and 10-3, the increase in EI is statistically significant due garlic extract. each row represents a concentration of virus. the first row was control group and the second to sixth rows for 10-2 to 10-6 concentrations of virus. 0/++ 0/++ 0/++ 2/++ 2/++ - - - 820.898 0.05 10-4 4 0/++ 0/++ 0/++ 0/++ 0/++ 0/++ 4043.6227 10-5 4 0/+ 0/+ 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 3644.2476 10-6 4 0/+ 0/+ injection of intervet 4/91 alone causes a reduction in EI as compared to the control group that was not treated. treatment with the garlic extract, after 8 hr, showed that this extract can inhibit the effects of Intervet 4/91 on embryos. the embryo egg groups were: IBV infected control that expose to 10-3 dilution of intervet 4/91 (group ii); treatment with garlic extract 8 hr after exposure to the 10-3 dilution of intervet4/91 (group ii); Non-treatment control (group v). high grade reduction of growth in comparison to group iii (+); equal growth in comparison to group iii (+); equal growth in comparison to group iii (+). treatment with garlic extract, 8 hr after exposure to M41 can increase the EI as compared to the control group. the mean EI for control group that received only PBS is shown as a grey column (3804.6), the mean EI for the group that received 10-3 concentration of M41 is shown as black column (1587.6) and the mean EI for embryos that were infected by 10-3 concentration of M41 is shown as black column (1587.6) ii 10-2 4 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 3361281 0.05 10-4 4 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0 0.05 iii 0 8 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 0/- 3728 All data are expressed as the meanstandard deviation of triplicate samples. t-test analysis using t-test analysis using EXCEL 2010 for Windows. garlic extract has a significant effect on intervet 4/91 as a sub-acute strain both in the mixture with several dilutions of virus and as a treatment, 8 hr after exposure to the virus. the increase in EI in all experimental groups of intervet 4/91 increased. Yin et al. (2011) studied on the effect of Houttuynia cordata on IBV-infected cells by using the plaque assay and PCR. a mixture of oleoresins and essential oils (QR448) had antiviral effect on IBV in vitro and in vivo. cell viability assessed by MTT assay, number of infected cell assessed by immunoperoxidase assay and amount of viral protein expression assessed by luciferase-based assay. results showed that these agents have antiviral activity against most of the members of Nidovirales."}
