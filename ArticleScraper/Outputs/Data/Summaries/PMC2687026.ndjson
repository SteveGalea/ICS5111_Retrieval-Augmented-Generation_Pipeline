{"summary": "in 1997, a prototype GPHIN system was developed in a partnership between the government of Canada and the WHO. the aim was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using news media sources to continuously gather information about possible disease outbreaks worldwide. the sources included websites, news wires, and local and national newspapers retrieved through news aggregators in English and French. data dissemination machine translation English articles are machine-translated into Arabic, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Farsi, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish. non-English articles are machine-translated into English. the information was 2\u20133 days ahead of the official WHO report of confirmed and probable cases worldwide. in addition to outbreak reporting, GPHIN has also provided information that enabled public health officials to track global effects of the outbreak. each day, GPHIN handles 4,000 articles. this number drastically increases when events with serious public health implications are reported. linguistic, interpretive, and analytical expertise of the GPHIN analysts makes the system successful. GPHIN has adopted a best-of-breed approach in selecting engines for machine translation. the lexicons associated with the engines are constantly being improved to enhance the quality of the output. non-English articles are machine-translated into Arabic, Chinese, farsi, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish. the system was the first to provide preliminary information to the public health community about a new strain of influenza in northern People\u2019s Republic of China (20). During the SARS outbreak, declared by WHO in March 2003, the GPHIN prototype demonstrated its potential as an early-warning system by detecting and informing the appropriate authorities. healthMap has been featured in mainstream media publications, such as Wired News and Scientific American, indicating the broad utility of such a system that extends beyond public health practice (24,26). the system integrates outbreak data from multiple electronic sources, including media reports, surveillance data, and informal reports of disease events and disseminates it to public health leaders. the system is currently being ported to other languages, such as portugal and arabic. the data are aggregated by source, disease, and geographic location and then overlaid on an interactive map for user-friendly access to the original report. from October 2006 through November 20, 2007, HealthMap processed >35,749 alerts across 171 disease categories and 202 countries or semiautonomous or overseas territories. most alerts come from news media (92.8%) followed by ProMED (6.5%) and multinational agencies (0.7%). system uses text mining to characterize the data to determine the disease category and location of the outbreak. alerts are geocoded to the country scale with province-, state-, or city-level resolution for select countries. system currently being ported to other languages, such as Portuguese and Arabic. healthMap processes an average of 133.5 disease alerts/day. 50% are categorized as breaking news (65.3 reports/day) most alerts come from news media, followed by proMED and multinational agencies. EpiSPIDER uses natural language processing to transform free-text content into structured information that can be stored in a relational database. each news report that has location information can be linked to relevant demographic- and health-specific information (e.g. population, per capita gross domestic product, public health expenditure, and physicians/1,000 population) MED-mail content facilitates EpiSPIDER\u2019s redistribution of structured data to services that can consume them. the SIMILE Exhibit API (http://simile.mit.edu) that consumes JSON-formatted data files enables faceted browsing of information by using scatter plots, Google Maps, and timelines. EpiSPIDER was designed in 2006 to serve as a visualization supplement to the ProMED-mail reports. the project was designed to serve as a visualization supplement to the ProMED-mail reports. the project was designed to serve as a visualization supplement to the ProMED-mail reports. this feature provides different contexts for viewing emerging infectious disease information. by using askMEDLINE (30), EpiSPIDER also provides context-sensitive links to recent and relevant scientific literature for each ProMED-mail report topic. EpiSPIDER is used by persons in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. it receives 50\u201390 visits/hour, originating from 150\u2013200 sites. in the latter half of 2008, daily access to graphs and exhibits surpassed access to data feeds. healthMap\u2019s strategy is to rely on open-access news aggregators (e.g., GoogleNews and Moreover) and curated sources (e.g., ProMED, GDACS, and CIA Factbook) for completeness, the broadest range of sources is critical. healthMap provides a geographic and temporal panorama of ongoing epidemics through an open-access user interface. it automatically filters out the reports that do not correspond to breaking alerts. the remaining alerts are prepared for display to allow faceted browsing. all 3 systems are inherently prone to noise because most of the data sources they use or plan to use are not verified by public health professionals. false alerts need to be mitigated because they might have substantial undue economic and social consequences."}
