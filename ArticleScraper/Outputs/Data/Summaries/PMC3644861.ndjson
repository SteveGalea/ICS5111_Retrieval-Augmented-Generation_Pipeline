{"summary": "the CDC convened a workgroup to review existing information on transfusion and factor concentrate\u2013associated AIDS cases. a large lookback program had found that only 10 of 140 AIDS patients interviewed in San Francisco reported donating blood during previous years. a large lookback program had found that only 10 of 140 AIDS patients interviewed in San Francisco reported donating blood during previous years. donors could discreetly exclude themselves by answering \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a block of questions about known AIDS risk factors. presenting donors were provided with information about AIDS risk factors and where those with such risk factors were asked not to donate. homosexual community organizations discourage donation from atrisk men. more than 30% of donors testing positive for HIV were also reactive for antiHBc. 90% of recipients transfused with blood from HIVinfected or suspected cases acquired infection. six transmissions have been reported in the united states since 1999. the implementation of viral inactivation steps has eliminated transmission of HIV by plasma derivatives. the experience with transfusiontransmitted AIDS showed that infection with an agent having a long incubation period can spread in the blood supply for years before recognition. prospective studies suggested 10% or more of blood recipients were affected. the recognition of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the development of diagnostic tests revealed that the vast majority of residual PTH was not due to HAV or HBV. hepatitis c virus (HCV) was cloned through an incredibly painstaking manual process. it was eventually identified in 1989 and specific tests for antibodies to HCV were developed. the experience with NANBH illustrates the power of persistence and teaches us lessons about the benefits and risks of surrogate testing. the AIDS epidemic caused a massive shift in focus to blood safety. a baseline estimate of viral sequences in humans has not yet been established, but the human microbiome is under active investigation. two NIH grants are specifically addressing plasma viral discovery programs. only 10 of 140 AIDS patients interviewed in San Francisco reported donating blood in previous years. the cause of AIDS was still unknown in 1983, but the workgroup remarked that use of \u201cnonspecific markers\u201d was under evaluation. the blood bank in San Francisco developed a process where donors could discreetly exclude themselves by answering \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a block of questions about known AIDS risk factors. antiHBc testing yielded many false positives, and no confirmatory tests were available. there were concerns that positive surrogate tests would be concerning donors. elimination of homosexual donors would negatively affect blood supply. time antiHBc testing was implemented and by 90% by the time HIVspecific testing was available. breakthrough cases were detected shortly after introduction of HIV antibody testing. a further study found an infectious window period of 56 days from infection to detectable antibody conversion by the firstgeneration screening assays. the long latency from infection to symptoms and high disease risk in infected persons only became clear once serology was possible. the ability to respond to future threats and move tests through the approval process may also take a long time, emphasizing the importance of having all stakeholders including manufacturers, the blood community, and the FDA involved as soon as possible. insensitive tests for HBsAg were implemented as a blood safety measure. the recognition of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the development of diagnostic tests revealed that the vast majority of residual PTH was not due to HAV or HBV. hepatitis C virus (HCV) was cloned through an incredibly painstaking manual process. it became clear that all NANBH was due to transmission of HCV. routine testing for this antibody by firstgeneration assays was implemented in 1990. NAT for HCV was additionally implemented in 1999. a baseline estimate of viral sequences in humans has not yet been established, but the human microbiome is under active investigation. two NIH grants are specifically addressing plasma viral discovery programs. 4 Viruses such as HCV and HIV remain significant public health problems in the developing world. ALT testing for other agents remains controversial. the transfusion medicine community took a waitandsee approach during the first four transmission seasons. a series of interventions were implemented to mitigate the WNV risk starting in the fall of 2002. a 2008 AABB Association Bulletin recommended that IDNAT be triggered when two presumptively viremic donors are seen within a rolling 7 days. the triggers have evolved while recognizing the operational burden inherent in testing ID aliquots. the use of seasonal WNV testing has been discussed as a measure to enhance further the sensitivity of WNV detection in blood donors. this program involves the potential suspension of testing in the winter when human activity is minimal. these steps might enhance the capacity to convert to ID testing during the transmission season by conserving resources in testing facilities during lowincidence periods. the prevalence of Chagas disease in North America might be higher than previously thought, particularly in regions where a large proportion of donors have emigrated from Chagasendemic countries. studies attempting to identify atrisk donors through direct questioning have proven ineffective in that this strategy lacks sensitivity and specificity. all are transmitted by transfusion, are associated with a clinically apparent or fatal disease, and lack an effective intervention. these and other emerging pathogens, including T. cruzi, share few common characteristics. babesiosis is the most important arthropod (vector)borne disease in the world. more than 40% of the world's population, or approximately 2.5 billion people, are considered at risk. dengue is the leading cause of hospitalization and death among children. vCJD, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a prion-associated, degenerative, and always fatal disease with a lengthy incubation period of 5 to 15 years. most infected individuals exhibit no symptoms and therefore questions regarding symptom history would also be ineffective. the risk for vCJD appears to be declining, but the number of exposed individuals is unknown. no licensed test is available as a donor screen, and the development, licensure, and implementation of a screening test are unlikely in the united states. a series of interventions were implemented to mitigate the WNV risk starting in the fall of 2002. 18 including a nonspecific deferral for symptoms consistent with WNV fever, quarantine of plasma for transfusion collected during periods of high WNV activity. the number of recognized transfusiontransmitted WNV cases shrank from 23 to 6 from 2002 to 2003. six additional cases of transfusiontransmitted WNV have been recognized from 2004 through 2011. these cases were attributed primarily to insensitive triggers and inefficient communication between neighboring centers. some systems extend ID screening for 2 weeks or more beyond the last viremic donation. success was possible in part because there was rapid consensus about need to intervene. response to NANBH was delayed in part because of concerns nonspecific interventions might do more harm than good. 2 Public\u2013private partnerships were critical to the successful responses to WNV emergence. trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia, dengue viruses, and the variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease prion Susan L. Stramer, PhD, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, results in chronic infection and can be silent for decades. the prevalence of Chagas disease in North America might be higher than previously thought. the parasite Babesia, dengue viruses, and the prion responsible for causing variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease (vCJD) all are transmitted by transfusion, are associated with a clinically apparent or fatal disease, and lack an effective intervention. babesiosis is the most important arthropod (vector)borne disease in the world. dengue is the most important arthropod disease in the world caused by one of four types of dengue viruses. vCJD, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a prion-associated, degenerative, and always fatal disease with a lengthy incubation period of 5 to 15 years. the majority of the 225 vCJD cases reported worldwide through October 2011 have been observed in the united kingdom (n = 176). only three vCJD cases have been reported in the united states. the risk for vCJD appears to be declining, but the number of exposed individuals is unknown, and a second wave of infections is possible. the gamma retrovirus XMRV was detected in the blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) XMRV infection could be seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and plasma. the AABB adopted a precautionary policy of donor education and selfdeferral for persons with a history of CFS. a summary of the data and the Task Force policy was published in TRANSFUSION. the AABB Task Force presented a single voice and focused on a rapidly evolving issue. the response and pressure by the patient population was an important dynamic in generating a call for action in terms of blood safety. there were several polytropic viruses that were not XMRV. the SRWG brought together retrovirologists with XMRV experience, experts in the field of CFS or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), blood banking and transfusiontransmitted infectious disease experts, statistical and epidemiology experts, and blood product regulatory experts. each SRWG participant's organization provided support in terms of effort and scientific expertise while NHLBI provided the necessary administrative support. SRWG focused on evaluating assays to identify and quantify viral NAs and antibodies to establish the prevalence of XMRV infection among blood donors. three studies were conducted, and results were disseminated as soon as they became available to all relevant stakeholders through presentations, webinars, and publications. a careful review of epidemiologic knowledge on potential association of blood transfusions with cancer revealed little to no association. panels consisted of XMRVinfected cells (22Rv1 cells) or supernatant from those cells, diluted in WB or plasma respectively to mimic potential clinical samples. the differences in detection of NA could not be explained by a lack of sensitivity. 67 samples and controls were divided and distributed to nine independent laboratories for blinded testing. six of seven laboratories performing NAT found no positive clinical samples. phylogenetic analysis suggested all sequences likely arose from 22Rv1 contamination. there is no association between XMRV and CFS or prostate cancer, several questions are unresolved. it is not clear whether the original studies tested cases versus controls in a blinded fashion. the response to XMRV occurred rapidly and deliberately with respect to blood safety. the AABB adopted a precautionary policy of donor education and selfdeferral for persons with a history of CFS. the policy was instituted widely in the united states and in canada. if the FDA feels industry is responding appropriately to a potential threat to the blood supply, it can withhold its own action. a robust process is needed to decide which stakeholders should participate in decision making and to verify who has implemented recommendations. if the FDA feels industry is responding appropriately to a potential threat to the blood supply, it can withhold its own action. the SRWG was charged with designing and coordinating studies to evaluate whether XMRV posed a threat to blood safety. the SRWG brought together retrovirologists with XMRV experience, experts in the field of CFS or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), blood banking and transfusiontransmitted infectious disease experts, statistical and epidemiology experts. the SRWG first evaluated all relevant literature, including all XMRV related reports, animal studies, and observational studies. the SRWG focused on evaluating assays to identify and quantify viral NAs and antibodies to establish the prevalence of XMRV infection among blood donors. the SRWG included several laboratories with assays to detect NA from XMRV and other related MLVs. the panels consisted of XMRVinfected cells (22Rv1 cells) or supernatant from those cells, diluted in WB or plasma respectively to mimic potential clinical samples. the differences in detection of NA could not be explained by a lack of sensitivity. the fourth NA laboratory was unable to report results due to an internal error in sample processing. the final serologic laboratory reported three of four patients with CFS to be seropositive for XMRV. the control was also found to be positive. several publications have reported no signs of XMRV in human blood donors 64, 65, 68, 69. additional publications have found no association between XMRV and CFS, 70, 71 and further evidence that detection of XMRV in clinical samples is the result of contamination from multiple sources. 60 These reports eventually led to retractions of the two articles that reported detection of XMRV in CFS patients and control donors. there is no evidence XMRV ever entered the human population, but the creation of XMRV through passage of human tissue in mice does illustrate that novel threats could come from crossspecies transfer of an agent. the classic paradigm of emerging threats to the blood supply assumes that an agent can cause persistent, asymptomatic infections in donors. transfusion bypasses the body's natural defenses and can be a highly efficient route of transmission. even low concentrations of pathogen can be transmitted based on the volume of blood transfused. many recipients are often immunosuppressed and can develop severe clinical disease if infected. in vitro studies can assess viability of organisms in stored blood components. the evaluation of emerging threats faces new challenges. discovery programs will identify new agents, some of which might appear in asymptomatic donors. the risk of infection with these agents depends more on where someone lives or travels. there has been no evidence that recent measles outbreaks are transmitted by transfusion, but there has been enough concern for a working group to issue a fact sheet. the AABB EID group has published a review of 68 agents in TRANSFUSION. the committee has prioritized agents into four groups based on public health or regulatory concerns. an expert group working with Canadian Blood Services has published a model of the risk of an emerging pathogen entering the blood supply. the first challenge to addressing the implications of EIDs is identifying which agents can be transmitted by transfusion. the public health and blood transfusion communities respond, relying on the experience gained over the past three decades. inherent uncertainties include identifying which EIDs pose a threat to blood safety and managing risks based on imperfect tests and incomplete data. inherent uncertainties include identifying which EIDs pose a threat to blood safety and managing risks based on imperfect tests. scientists have triggers to ensure that appropriate people have been alerted before an article is published. but this plan is in place only for findings that could be applied to bioterrorism threats. this could have resulted in a substantial delay in recognition of public health implications. a risk assessment and management action plan must be developed once a new threat has been identified. an action plan can include triggers and decision points to guide theoretical actions. a formalized process would ensure that blood safety is considered and optimally addressed in parallel with other epidemic response priorities. the task force suggested the following to aid in the development of optimized risk assessment and management action plans. create action plans with clearly defined stakeholders, decision trees, and thresholds for action. these triggers can cause stakeholders to convene and consider proposed actions in light of existing and evolving evidence. recognition of a public health threat should trigger the activation of rapid funding mechanisms and/or the ability to redirect existing research program funds toward data collection, specimen banking, and risk assessment. newly created \u201crapid response\u201d funding mechanisms would allow for flexibility and should involve the biotechnology and diagnostic industry and FDA as early as possible to enable rapid development and approval of tests. formalizing and documenting existing informal response infrastructure will provide a record of a fading collective memory. the task force suggested that the blood safety community should: 1 Formalize and document the existing informal response infrastructure to help mitigate the effects of a fading collective memory. current infectious disease alert systems should be refined. the triggers for response to potential threats remain ad hoc and inconsistent. it is unclear what criteria short of demonstrated transfusion transmission are relevant. the blood safety community is responsible for developing and initiating a risk assessment and management action plan once a new threat has been identified. a checklist (or decision tree) similar to that used by the faa in responding to emergencies was suggested. an action plan can include triggers and decision points to guide theoretical actions, but these triggers could simply provide impetus for further consideration. a formalized, systematized infrastructure could minimize the consequences of transitions in expertise and leadership and a fading collective memory. the task force suggested the following to aid in the development of optimized risk assessment and management action plans. large donor and donor\u2013recipient repositories are valuable resources to evaluate transfusion transmission risks. existing programs that are capable of addressing public health risks are extremely valuable. the usual funding mechanisms of government agencies, such as NIH R01 grants, are slow. newly created \u201crapid response\u201d funding mechanisms would allow for flexibility. the importance of training future experts is training future experts. the blood safety community must engage junior investigators to actively participate and to take leadership roles in future responses to EIDs. dr. james mccarthy, dr. james mccarthy, dr. james mccarthy, dr. james mccarthy, dr. mccarthy, dr. mccarthy, dr. mccarthy, dr. mccarthy, dr. mccarthy, d MMWR 1982;31:3657.
