{"summary": "cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs) and membrane-anchored toll-like receptors (TLRs) main sensor families for RNA viruses are the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs) several ISGs participate in regulation of IFN gene expression (8\u201310). one of the most expressed ISGs is isg15 (IFN-stimulated gene 15), which was first identified as encoding a 15-kDa protein induced in the early phase of the IFN response in bovine and human cells. ISGylation targets proteins involved in distinct cellular pathways. IFN signaling, RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling/polymerase II transcription, cytoskeleton organization, and regulation of stress responses and translation. viruses have developed strategies to counteract the antiviral effect of ISG15 by inhibition of ISGylation (42, 43) or induction of deISGylation activity (44\u201347) the IFN system is unknown in invertebrates but appears to be well conserved among vertebrates. alian ISG15 homologues were then described in different fish species. zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) (52), crucian carp (Carassius auratus) (53), black rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli) (54), black rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli) (54), black rockfish ( all animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice. all animal work was approved by the direction of the Veterinary Services of Versailles. primers zfISG15HA_fw and zfISG15_rv were designed on the basis of this sequence. we amplified the mature form of zebrafish isg15 from a cDNA from an adult zebrafish injected with bacterial extract. this sequence was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) with an HA tag. cells of the Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line (EPC cells) were maintained in the modified Eagle's medium (GMEM)- 25 mM HEPES (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Eurobio), 1% tryptose phosphate broth (Eurobio), 2 mM l-glutamine (PAA) and antibiotics. the novirhabdoviruses IHNV 32-87 and VHSV 07-71 were produced at 14\u00b0C on EPC cells in GMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 5% tryptose, and 2 mM l-glutamine. heat-adapted variants IHNV 25-70 and VHSV 25-111 were similarly propagated in EPC cells at 24\u00b0C. the birnavirus infectious pancreatic nec 50 l of Dynabeads was incubated with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche), anti-phosphoprotein (anti-P) of IHNV monoclonal antibody, or anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. the immunoprecipitated complex was then washed in lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, denatured at 90\u00b0C for 5 min before cell supernatant was taken after 24, 48, and 72 h of infection for virus titration experiments, before fixation for cytopathic effect analysis at 72 h postinfection. RNA was purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. at 60\u00b0C, 20 min from 60\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C, and 15 s at 95\u00b0C. all animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice. all animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice. zebrafish expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences matched a unique isg15 homologue located on chromosome 5 in the zebrafish zv9 genome assembly. subsequent TBLASTN searches performed on the zebrafish genome failed to reveal other isg15 paralogues. cells of the Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line (EPC cells) were maintained in the modified Eagle's medium (GMEM)\u2013 25 mM HEPES (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth. the novirhabdoviruses IHNV 32-87 and VHSV 07-71 were produced at 14\u00b0C on EPC cells in GMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 5% tryptose, and 2 mM l-glutamine. the birnavirus infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) VR299 was propagated on blue fin 2 (BF-2) cells at 14\u00b0C. transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplied with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) Viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with Dynabeads-protein G (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's recommendations. zf-TRIM25 immunodetection was determined by immunoprecipitation with agarose-immobilized anti-HA antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) at 96 h posttransfection (hpt), EPC cell monolayers were infected with the different viruses. cells were incubated with viral inoculum at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) in GMEM\u20132% FBS for 1 h at 14\u00b0C. zf-ISG15 is involved in cell protein ISGylation. a unique isg15 gene encoding a 157-amino-acid (aa) protein was found in the zebrafish genome. a conserved LRLRGG motif was found at the C-terminal end of the protein. zf-isg15 induction in the gut (17- and 7-fold, respectively; Fig. 1B) compared to the level of expression in the noninfected state. similar inductions were observed in the pronephros (data not shown) d encoding the HA-tagged protein (pHA-zf-ISG15) in cells of a fish epithelial cell line (EPC cells) in western blot analysis performed with anti-HA antibody, HA-zf-ISG15 appeared to be a major band of the expected size (19.2 kDa) in cellular extracts at 72 h posttransfection (Fig. 1C, lane 2). zf-ISG15 has antiviral activity against viruses from different families. the list included four strains of IHNV, clinical isolate IHNV 32-87 and the heat-adapted strain IHNV 25-70. two strains of VHSV, wild-type isolate VHSV 07-71 and the heat-adapted strain VSHV 25-111. LRAA (red), GFP (green), or an empty vector (violet) or mock transfected (mock) and infected with the indicated RNA and DNA viruses at an MOI of 1. the error bars are not always visible when the differences are very small. the effect on IPNV infection was even stronger, with a reduction of 4,500-fold. HA-zf-ISG15 also inhibited VSHV from 18-fold for VSHV 07-71 to 170-fold for heat-adapted VSHV 25-111 during the same period. the inhibition was a specific effect, since overexpression of the ISG15LRAA mutant did not trigger any inhibition. in contrast, we observed only a transient cytopathic effect at 24 hpi. overexpression of HA-zf-ISG15 conferred resistance to infection performed with purified virus, excluding a potential role of cytokines present in the original virus inoculum. despite significant viral inhibition, this loss of adherence was also observed with a fish iridovirus, suggesting a general inhibition mechanism interfering with RNA and DNA viruses. ISGylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with agarose-immobilized anti-HA antibody before anti-HA immunodetection from cells overexpressing HA-zf-ISG15 infected (lane 1) or not (lane 2) with IHNV 25-70. proteins coimmunoprecipitated with GFP antibody (GFP-IP) after two different exposure times. reexamined the ISGylation of IHNV proteins in coexpression experiments. protein expression was first verified in doubly transfected cells. HA-zf-ISG15 conjugates of either the GFP-NV or GFP-P proteins could be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-GFP antibody. results demonstrate conjugation of ISG15 with GFP-NV and GFP-P proteins of IHNV proteins that are involved in subversion of the IFN response. zf-TRIM25-V5 was coimmunoprecipitated with HA-zf-ISG15 upon protein coexpression. zf-TRIM25-V5 was not precipitated in absence of HA-zf-ISG15 expression (lane 3) or upon coexpression with the conjugation-defective mutant of ISG15 (lane 5) level of expression of tagged proteins in cell lysate at 72 hpt (crude extract) was evaluated by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies. normalization was performed with -tubulin detection. ISGylation of viral proteins was determined by HA immunodetection of GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins. NV and P protein immunodetection with anti-HA antibody was abrogated when ISG15 was replaced by the mutant, confirming that the GG motif is required for conjugation to these viral proteins. moiety can be conjugated with up to two ISG15 subunits, while P has one ISGylation site. the assay was reproduced upon cotransfection of pHA-zf-ISG15 and an expression plasmid of a nontagged IHNV P protein. NV proteins of IHNV constitute targets for ISGylation. ISGylation regulates the expression of components of the RIG-I/IFN/ISG pathways. we also studied vig-1/viperin, an ISG highly conserved between fish and mammals. vig-1/viperin, rig-1, and rig-I gene transcripts were normalized to the expression of the -actin gene. the expression of vig-1/viperin, rig-1, and IFN gene transcripts was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene Ef1-. however, when EPC cells were transfected with pHA-zf-ISG15LRAA instead of pHA-zf-ISG15LRAA, we observed a in, rig-I, and Ef1-, in EPC cells overexpressing HA-zf-ISG15LRGG or HA-zf-ISG15LRAA were normalized to the level of -actin expression. significant differences were determined using welch's unpaired t test performed on CT values (where CT is the threshold cycle) zf-isg15 transcript expression was assessed in the adult zebrafish upon infection by the vesiculovirus SVCV or by the novirhabdovirus IHNV (strain 25-70) both viruses induced a strong zf-isg15 induction in the gut (17- and 7-fold, respectively; Fig. 1B) compared to the level of expression in the noninfected state. zf-ISG15LRAA mutant expression was restricted to free isoforms (lane 3) no signal was detected from mock-transfected cells (lane 1). HA-zf-ISG15LRAA mutant expression was restricted to free isoforms. zf-ISG15 has antiviral activity against viruses from different families. zf-ISG15 has antiviral activity against viruses from different families. zf-ISG15 is well conserved and highly inducible by viral infection. EPC cells were transfected with zf-ISG15 or empty vector before infection with IHNV 25-70 at an MOI of 1 for 24 h. zf-ISG15 overexpression measured viral growth from 0 to 72 hpi. error bars are not always visible when differences are very small. HA-zf-ISG15LRAA inhibited IHNV growth from 3,200-fold for IHNV 32-87 to 2,200-fold for heat-adapted IHNV 25-70 at 72 hpi. effect on IPNV infection was even stronger, with a reduction of 4,500-fold. a significant ISG15 antiviral effect was also observed on the DNA virus EHNV. infection of control EPC cells with IHNV 25-70 led to a complete destruction of the cell monolayer after 72 hpi. in contrast, we observed only a transient cytopathic effect at 24 hpi upon overexpression of zf-ISG15. overexpression of HA-zf-ISG15 also conferred resistance to infection performed with purified virus, excluding potential role of cytokines present in the original virus inoculum. a similar effect was observed with a fish iridovirus. a similar effect was observed with a fish iridovirus. a similar effect was observed with a fish iridovirus. the expression level of the tagged proteins was determined from total cell lysates (crude extracts) by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (-HA), anti-GFP antibody (-GFP) and -tubulin (-TUB) as a gel loading control. native P and NV proteins are indicated by asterisks on the right. ISGylation of neosynthesized viral proteins was determined by Western blotting of GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins. at 72 hpt, HA-zf-ISG15 conjugates of either the GFP-NV or GFP-P proteins could be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-GFP antibody. the LRAA motif is required for ISGylation of cellular and viral proteins. zf-TRIM25 has been shown to be an E3 ligase that regulates the activation of the antiviral protein RIG-I by catalyzing the conjugation of ubiquitin and ISG15 molecules to RIG-I (6, 70) only one of the two proteins (here named zf-TRIM25) displays all the domains of the human protein, thus being its likely functional orthologue (71) the LRAA motif is required for ISGylation of cellular and viral proteins. the level of expression of tagged proteins in cell lysate at 72 hpt was evaluated by Western blotting. normalization was performed with -tubulin detection. pHA-zf-ISG15 (lane 1), pHA-zf-ISG15LRAA (lane 2), NV-GFP (lane 3), GFP (lane 4), pHA-zf-ISG15 plus NV-GFP (lane 5), pHA-zf-ISG15 plus NV-GFP (lane 6), pHA-zf-ISG15LRAA plus NV-GFP (lane ISGylated and then migrated as a band with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. the NV moiety can be conjugated with up to two ISG15 subunits. the NV moiety can be conjugated with up to two ISG15 subunits. anti-HA antibodies, and normalization was performed with -tubulin detection. the results establish that the P and NV proteins of IHNV constitute targets for ISGylation, consistent with the antiviral role of zebrafish ISG15 established previously. the requirement for IFN as an intermediate is often tested for by the addition of cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. but this strategy could not be applied to pHA-zf-ISG15-transfected cells, as it would block HA-zf-ISG15 expression. however, when EPC cells were transfected by poly(IC), we observed a significant upregulation of vig-1/viperin and rig-I transcript ISG15 modulates expression of the IFN- gene, vig-1/viperin, rig-I, and rig-I. expression of the IFN- gene, vig-1/viperin, rig-I, and Ef1- was measured by qPCR. zf-ISG15 overexpression in cyprinid EPC cells triggers ISGylation of cellular proteins. this ensures protection against different RNA and DNA viruses. overexpression of a mutated ISG15 devoid of the conserved diglycine motif failed to restrict virus production in the transfected cells. immunolabeling performed on infected cells at 72 hpi showed that IHNV antigen was expressed only in cells with nuclear condensation. cells expressing ISG15 did not present IHNV staining or apoptotic nuclei. altogether, these data indicate a strong antiviral effect mediated by ISG15 against different novirhabdovirus strains occurring in early steps of the viral cell cycle. supernatant of zf-ISG15-transfected cells was not sufficient to confer protection against IHNV 25-70 infection. this lack of protection could be due to the low level of ISG15 expression in the supernatant or to improper maturation when secreted by EPC cells. the nonvirion protein (NV) and the phosphoprotein (P) of IHNV were found to interact with ISG15 in EPC cells in cotransfection experiments. this suggests that effective ISGylation activity is required for the zf-ISG15 effect against IHNV, VSHV, IPNV, and EHNV. bacterial infections lead to overexpression of ISG15 through various pathways (20). besides IFN expression, protein kinase R can act as a viral sensor and induce a number of IRF3-dependent genes, including isg15 (40). in fish, it has recently been established that not only IFN- but also IFN- induces isg15 expression (82). ISG15 negatively controls the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway (8) through modulation of ubiquitination. results suggest that it induces the expression of rig-I at the mRNA level."}
