{"summary": "occupational exposure and hazards experienced by healthcare workers during bronchoscopy have been increasingly realized. the present review analyzes various aspects of adverse effects experienced by healthcare workers during bronchoscopy. radiation exposure should be limited to 20 mSv/year (2). the stochastic effects include carcinogenic and genetic effects. the probability of occurrence is related to the dose level. atsurada et al. calculated the radiation dose received by healthcare workers over 132 cases of endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath under X-ray guidance. the results showed that in a procedure with a median radiation time of 7.6 min, the operator received a median radiation dose of 12 Sv. changes in the patient\u2019s body mass index and the location of the R-EBUS probe resulted in a relative increase in the radiation dose received by healthcare workers radiation exposure and protection from radioactive particles Chemotherapy is a crucial treatment method for most lung cancer patients who cannot be treated surgically. 125I and 192Ir are the most commonly used radioactive particles. the mean radiation dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was 12.314.05 Sv/h. the dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was close to the natural background dose. the following protective measures should be in place for healthcare workers performing radioactive particle implantation procedures. occupational radiation exposure includes chronic low-dose radiation. non-stochastic and stochastic effects include erythema, skin peeling, myelosuppression, organ atrophy, cataracts, and infertility. the effective radiation dose received through protective garments was attenuated to 0.4 Sv for the operator and 0.2 Sv for the assistant. in a procedure with a median radiation time of 7.6 min, the operator received a median radiation dose of 12 Sv. all healthcare workers wore protective lead garments providing protection of 0.50-mm lead equivalents at the front and 0.25 lead equivalents at the sides and back. the principles of protection for general occupational radiation exposure should follow the principles of protection for general occupational radiation exposure. radiation dose was measured immediately after and 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery. the radiation dose decreased rapidly with increasing distance. at a distance of 50 cm, the detected dose was similar to the natural background radiation dose (10.2\u201310.8 Sv/h) patients should be covered with a rubber sheet or wear leaded clothing with a lead equivalence of 0.18\u20130.25 mm. no special protective measures are necessary after discharge. regular post-operative follow-ups are needed to detect any displacement of particles. argon plasma coagulation uses high-frequency and high-voltage ionization of argon gas into argon ions. surgical smoke contains 95% steam; the remaining 5% is chemical compounds and tissue debris, which may be hazardous to human health. exposure to benzene can trigger nausea and headaches, while long-term exposure can result in hematopoietic disorders, which may cause anemia or even lymphomas. invisible particles can travel long distances in the air, with smaller particles travel up to 100 cm. smoke evacuators should be placed within 5 cm of the surgical field. a special smoke evacuator should be used during laser irradiation. the tip of the smoke evacuator should be placed within 5 cm of the laser irradiation area. the high-frequency electric knife uses the thermal effects generated by passing a high-frequency electric current through the tissue. this causes the explosive vaporization of tissues under the electrode. the argon plasma coagulation uses high-frequency and high-voltage ionization of argon gas into argon ions, which allows continuous conduction of an electric current. exposure to acrylonitrile can cause mucosal inflammation, cancer, and other health problems. exposure to benzene can trigger nausea and headaches. long-term exposure can result in hematopoietic disorders. cancerous cells carry cancerous genes and are disseminated via surgical smoke. toxic and hazardous chemical compounds have been detected in smoke. overexposure to CO causes headaches, nausea, emesis, and heart arrhythmia. coagulase-negative staphylococci, Neisseria, and Corynebacterium were detected in smoke produced from laser treatment of papillomas. human immunodeficiency virus fragments were detected in the smoke produced from affected patients. there is currently insufficient evidence for the transmission of pathogens to healthcare workers via surgical smoke. most smoke generated during procedures is aspirated using negative-pressure suction devices. there are currently no studies of the protective measures used in bronchoscopy rooms, but comparisons can be made to surgical smoke extraction devices. filtration surgical masks, protection goggles, gloves, and isolation gowns should be worn. a high filtration mask should be fitted closely to the face of the healthcare worker. the mask should be worn properly at all times (18). most of the reported laser eye accidents involve at least some carelessness. the victim usually experiences a sudden and severe disturbance of vision in one eye preceded by a visible flash of bright colored light and an audible pop without pain. the subsequent clinical course can be characterized by marked improvement during a few days to weeks. skin injuries inflicted by lasers tend to be milder than the ocular injuries. however, skin exposure to lasers should be avoided. bronchoscopy room should be equipped with fire extinguishers. use should be avoided in procedures involving placement of highly flammable implants in the airway, such as silicone objects. this may easily lead to airway injury, especially at oxygen concentrations above 40% or due to high-power laser output. healthcare workers should master the performance of Nd:YAG lasers, all related safety precautions, and disinfection procedures. the victim usually experiences a sudden and severe disturbance of vision in one eye preceded by a visible flash of bright colored light and an audible pop without pain. the subsequent clinical course can be characterized by marked improvement during a few days to weeks, mainly due to clearing of hemorrhage. skin injuries inflicted by lasers tend to be milder than the ocular injuries. however, skin exposure to lasers should be avoided. bronchoscopy room should be equipped with fire extinguishers. patients and healthcare workers should wear goggles to protect the eyes from specific laser wavelengths. the goggles can be made of plastic or glass and should include protective side shields. the end of the laser handle may cause burns during procedures. laser use should be avoided in procedures involving placement of highly flammable implants in the airway. the flow rate of oxygen, N2O, and other combustible gasses should be stopped or reduced to very low levels to minimize the risks of fires and explosions. pathogenic microbiological aerosols commonly include bacterial, viral, and fungal aerosols. most infectious respiratory diseases are spread through contact with infected patients or the inhalation of aerosol droplets contaminated by patients. the viability of microorganisms within microbiological aerosols is highly variable. the study did not detect any Mycobacterium or influenza viruses. the transmission of tuberculosis from TB patients to healthcare workers during bronchoscopy is a recognized occupational risk. scopy should first be tested for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and syphilis using interferon-gamma release assays. patients with suspected TB should undergo a tuberculin test, IGRAs, and T cell-based TB infection tests. patients diagnosed with active TB should be referred to designated TB medical institutions for treatment. pathogenic microbiological aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in a gaseous medium. aerosols in which the particles are microorganisms are referred to as microbiological aerosols are referred to as pathogenic microbiological aerosols. pathogens can be transmitted via aerosols from human to human and from the environment to humans. the culturable bacterial concentrations of air samples were higher than the background concentrations collected at the end of the procedure. all samples included at least one Staphylococcus species. the study did not detect any Mycobacterium or influenza viruses. the risk of infection is believed to be higher in healthcare workers performing bronchoscopy in patients with an unknown HIV status. all patients who undergo respiratory endoscopy should be tested for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and syphilis using interferon-gamma release assays. patients with suspected TB should undergo a tuberculin test, IGRAs, and T cell-based TB infection tests. ultraviolet irradiation (200\u2013275 nm) can effectively eliminate bacteria in pathogenic aerosols and enable rapid disinfection of indoor air. this prevents cross-contamination in hospitals and protects healthcare workers. patients should undergo comprehensive evaluation prior to bronchoscopy. antibacterial filtering masks with tight seal around nose and mouth are recommended. high-level disinfectants are hazardous to the respiratory system, skin, and conjunctiva of the endoscope cleaning and disinfection staff. glutaraldehyde Glutaraldehyde is used for manual and automated cleaning and disinfection, but not for sterilization. the effective concentration of glutaraldehyde for the disinfection of flexible endoscopes is 2.0\u20132.5%. there have been no deaths or cancer cases, and no in vivo or in vitro studies suggesting the presence of genetic and reproductive toxicity. peracetic acid peracetic acid can be used for manual and automated cleaning and disinfection. the commonly used concentrations of peracetic acid are 0.2% and 0.35%. the use of peracetic acid results in irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory mucosa (35). glutaraldehyde Glutaraldehyde has a relatively high usage rate among disinfectants for respiratory endoscopes. the effective concentration of glutaraldehyde for the disinfection of flexible endoscopes is 2.0\u20132.5%. there have been no reports of deaths or cancer cases, and no in vivo or in vitro studies suggesting the presence of genetic and reproductive toxicity. peracetic acid peracetic acid can be used for manual and automated cleaning and disinfection as well as for sterilization. the commonly used concentrations of peracetic acid are 0.2% and 0.35%. the use of peracetic acid results in irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory mucosa (35). ortho-phthalaldehyde disinfectants remain stable within a pH range of 3\u20139 and do not produce harmful volatile compounds. peracetic acid peracetic acid can be used for manual and automated cleaning and disinfection as well as for sterilization. the commonly used concentrations of peracetic acid are 0.2% and 0.35%. common cryogenic gases used in cryotherapy include CO2 and N2O. the cryogenic source is a component of the cryotherapy device. commonly used cryogens include CO2 and N2O due to their low cost. bronchoscopy rooms are usually connected to evacuators that dispose of cryogen waste gases. bronchoscopy rooms are usually connected to evacuators that dispose of cryogen waste gases, thereby reducing indoor concentrations. however, the effects on outdoor air pollution and the risks to the outdoor population require further investigation."}
