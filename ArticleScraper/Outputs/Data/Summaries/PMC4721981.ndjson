{"summary": "HCV is a single-stranded positive RNA enveloped virus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae. the viral RNA encodes a large polyprotein precursor of approximately 3000 amino acid residues. the majority of host-virus interactions are beneficial for the virus, including HCV. feron stimulated genes (ISGs) include double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR)[10], 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)[11], 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase (MxA)[12], and interferon-induced protein 56 (IFI-56K)[13]. however, for most ISGs, little is known B Replication N [33,63] Xrn1 Replication N [66-70] Xrn2 Replication N [67,68] Sac1 Replication N [83,84] ACBD3 Replication N [91] SOCS3 Replication N [97] PKD Secretion and release N [132] YB-1 Particle production N [137,138] HCV: Hepatitis C virus; IFN: Interferon; IFITM1: Interferon the IFITM family proteins have recently been shown to inhibit a number of viruses. a previous study defined IFITM1 as a hepatic tight junction protein and an ISG with activity against HCV entry. IFITM1 can disrupt the coordination of HCV coreceptor interactions to suppress viral entry. Ficolin-2 blocks the attachment of HCV cell entry by interfering with HCVcc binding to the LDL and SRBI receptors. ficolin-2 blocks the attachment of HCV cell entry by blocking the interactions between HCV and LDLR, SR-B1 and CD81[20]. RNA genome replicates within ribonucleoprotein complex on ER-derived membranous structures. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B form replicase complex. TRIM14, NOS2 and IFITM3 were identified as novel IFN- and IFN- stimulated genes contributing to the suppression of HCV replication. known as IFIT1) is induced in response to type I IFNs. it inhibits human HPV DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1[51]. previously implicated in the antiviral action of IFNs against west Nile virus and LCMV[50]. a potential interaction of CIDEB with the HCV protein NS2 was identified by a yeast-two hybrid assay[62]. a potential interaction of CIDEB with the HCV protein NS2 was identified by a yeast-two hybrid assay[62]. a potential interaction of CIDEB with the HCV protein NS2 was identified by a yeast-two hybrid assay[62]. depletion of either Xrn1 or Xrn2 affects HCV RNA stability. Xrn1 depletion causes significant decay of JFH1 and H77D. Xrn2 depletion has a relatively modest effect on JFH RNA decay. Sac1 is an evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P] and plays important roles at endoplasmic reticulum contact sites and in Golgi localization, retention and trafficking. overexpression of Sac1 inhibits HCV replication[83], whereas knockdown of Sac1 expression by siRNA significantly enhances HCV HCV NS5A co-localized with ACBD3 and NS5A from OR6 cells (GT1b) had higher binding affinity with ACBD3 than that from JFH1-infected Huh7.5.1 cells (GT2a) the colocalization efficiency between PI4KB and PI4P was higher than that in JFH1-infected Huh7.5.1 cells (GT2a)[91]. CS3 downregulates mTOR expression, and inhibition of mTOR could reverse the inhibitory effects of SOCS3 on HCV replication. MSR1, also known as SCARA1, SR-AI, or CD204, can mediate the endocytosis of a range of ligands, such as acetylated LDL, bacterial cell wall constituents. the viral replication complex is assembled close to cytosolic lipid droplets. the core protein localizes around the cLDs. NS2 is also a key player of viral assembly that engages in crosstalk with both structural and nonstructural proteins. BST-2 tethers or traps budding virions on the cell surface to block release. they are then endocytosed and degraded in lysosomes. PKD is a serine/threonine kinase including three isoforms. ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) play crucial roles in Golgi lipid trafficking and biogenesis. PKD negatively regulates HCV secretion and/or release through attenuation of CERT and OSBP function by phosphorylation inhibition. YB-1 was identified as a novel partner of NS3/4A and HCV genomic RNA. knockdown of YB-1 expression impairs HCV RNA replication and unexpectedly stimulates HCV virus production and/or release. these data show that YB-1 interacts with HCV NS3/4A and it is involved in HCV replication. powerful molecular virology tools and adequate experimental systems should be developed to further understand the mechanisms underlying this delicate balance between restriction factors and HCV. better understanding of this regulation may shed light on more effective therapeutic approaches."}
