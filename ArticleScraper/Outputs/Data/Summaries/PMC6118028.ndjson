{"summary": "ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) plays an important role in functional endothelium and has been implicated in PH amelioration. however, the molecular mechanism that regulates ACE2 in the endothelium in the context of PH is unknown. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation of ACE2 ser680 is PH protective. the impaired AMPK\u2013phospho-ACE2 axis was validated in specimens from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. ACE2 S680D Knock-in and ACE2-Knockout mice were developed with use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. three targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) were subcloned into the px330 vector. rats were given intraperitoneal injections with 60 mg/kg body weight MCT (Sigma-Aldrich) or saline. rats were then killed, and their tissues were collected for analysis. rodent hemodynamics and PH study were measured as described previously (20) the study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of California, San Diego. all individuals had given consent for lung biopsy. a bias based on sex may have been possible.

AMPK Thr172 and AMPK targeted acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase ser79 increased phosphorylation of ACE2 ser680 and total ACE2 protein concentrations in HUVECs. metformin, a vasoprotective antidiabetic drug, increased ACE2 phosphorylation and expression in HUVECs. AMPK ablation reduced ACE2 phosphorylation even with metformin stimulation. ACE2 peptides spanning Ser680 predicted phosphorylation with conservation in human, mouse, rat, and rabbit. AMPK activity assays were performed with ACE2 peptides spanning Ser680 or the dephosphomimetic with Ser replaced with Ala (S680A) phosphomimetic (S680D) mutant of ACE2 ser680 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cells that express minimal endogenous ACE2 (22) similar results were seen in cycloheximide chase experiments. a higher concentration of ACE2 in cells transfected with S680D than in those with S680A. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with ACE2 S680A or S680D plasmids for 48 hours, then treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 100 g/ml) for up to 8 hours. ACE2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and then immunoblotted with anti\u2013Ub-K48 (K48 ubiquitin) the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1\u20137 by ACE2 mediates eNOS-derived NO bioavailability (23). bovine aortic ECs with exogenously expressed ACE2 S680D showed increased concentrations of Ang 1\u20137 and NO in the conditioned media (Figure 2D and 2E), as well as increased eNOS phosphorylation (Figure 2F) and intracellular NO production (Figure 2G) ACE2 expression in lung ECs from ACE2 knock-in mice showed increased NO bioavailability (i.e., phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1177 and Ser633) phosphorylation attenuates pulmonary hypertension susceptibility in mice. thelial nitric oxide synthase; LV = left ventricle; p = phosphorylated; RV = right ventricle; S = septum; SBP = systolic blood pressure. mechanistic studies using endogenously altered ACE2 in onset of PH in vivo are lacking. ACE2/ mice with SU5416/hypoxia treatment showed aggravated PH as compared with their WT littermates. ACE2/ mice with SU5416/hypoxia treatment showed aggravated PH as compared with their WT littermates. phenotypic outcomes resulting from ACE2 ablation were recapitulated in control experiments using EC-AMPK2/ mice. ACE2 S680D reduced the mRNA concentration of EDN1 and NOTCH1 but increased that of BMPR2 and VEGF as compared with ACE2 S680A. data from these loss-of-function approaches with ACE2/ mice suggest that an impaired AMPK\u2013ACE2 axis aggravated the onset of PH. helial cells (ECs) isolated from EC-AMPK2/ mice were infected with ACE2 S680A or S680D adenovirus for 48 hours. eNOS phosphorylation was greater with ectopic expression of ACE2 S680A or S680D. concentrations of EDN1 and NOTCH1 increased those of BMPR2 and VEGF. ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) S680D mitigates endothelial cell dysfunction in rat pulmonary hypertension model. ACE2 S680D knock-in, ACE2/, EC-AMPK2/, and MCT-treated rat showed reduced concentrations of p-AMPK, p-ACE2 and ACE2. the dysregulated AMPK\u2013p-ACE2 axis in small arteries of IPAH lungs was confirmed by immunostaining. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)\u2013phosphorylated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)\u2013axis is impaired in human idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. indicated proteins were detected by (A) Western blot analysis and (B) immunostaining. AMPK2 phosphorylated an ACE2 oligopeptide containing Ser680 to a concentration similar to that of SAMS peptide. AMPK activation by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) led to substantially increased phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 as well as expression of total ACE2 protein concentrations in HUVECs. ACE2 peptides spanning Ser680 or the dephosphomimetic with ser replaced with Ala (S680A) were used as a positive control. adenosine (Ad)-null, constitutively active AMPK (Ad-AMPK-CA) or Ad-null, dominant-negative AMPK (Ad-AMPK-DN) at 10 multiplicities of infection for 48 hours. a phosphomimetic (S680D) mutant was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cells that express minimal endogenous ACE2 (22). a higher concentration of ACE2 in cells transfected with S680D than in those with S680A. similar results were seen in cycloheximide chase experiments. ACE2 ser680 phosphorylation enhances ACE2 stability and NO bioavailability. Western blot analysis of ACE2 and -tubulin concentrations in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cells transfected with ACE2 S680A or S680D plasmids for 48 hours, then treated with MG132 (20 mol/L) for an additional 10 hours. nitrite/nitrate fluorometric assay detected as accumulated nitrite/nitrate in culture media. NO production revealed by fluorescence intensity evaluated in bovine aortic endothelial cells. AMPK\u2013p-ACE2 Ser680 axis in cultured ECs was used to address the role of ACE2 ser680 phosphorylation in vivo. Flow cytometry revealed higher ACE2 expression in lung ECs from ACE2 S680D knock-in mice than in WT littermates. ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ser680 phosphorylation attenuates pulmonary hypertension susceptibility in mice hematoxylin and eosin staining of pulmonary arteries and percentage of vessel wall thickness in reference to the outer diameter of the vessels. scale bars are 20 m in F and 1 mm in G and H. data are mean SEM derived from five to seven mice per group. ACE2 knock-in mice showed largely abrogated pulmonary artery muscularization and luminal narrowing (Figure 3F) as well as intact vascularization (Figure 3G) to further address the role of ACE2 phosphorylation in endothelial function in vivo, we performed Evans blue staining to test the endothelial permeability of rodent pulmonary vessels. ACE2 S680D or ACE2 S680A ratified eNOS phosphorylation. ACE2 S680D reduced the mRNA concentration of EDN1 and NOTCH1. ACE2 S680D increased that of BMPR2 and VEGF compared with ACE2 S680A. hematoxylin and eosin staining of pulmonary arteries (C) and angiography of pulmonary vasculature in the indicated groups (D) Scale bars are 20 m in C and 1 mm in D. Western blot analysis of indicated proteins in lung tissue of ACE2/ mice. eNOS phosphorylation was greater with ectopic expression of ACE2 S680D than S680A. ACE2 S680D overexpression, though it reduced mRNA concentrations of EDN1 and NOTCH1, increased those of BMPR2 and VEGF. AMPK\u2013p-ACE2 Axis Is Impaired in Lungs of Humans with IPAH. the dysregulated AMPK\u2013p-ACE2 axis in small arteries of IPAH lungs was confirmed. ACE2 S680D overexpression augmented eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and Ser633. ACE2 S680D overexpression reduced the mRNA concentrations of EDN1 and NOTCH1 and increased those of BMPR2 and VEGF. p-eNOS = phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase; p-AMPK = phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase; VWF = Von Willebrand factor. ACE2 Ser680 phosphorylation is indispensable for ACE2 stability, resulting in enhanced NO production in ECs. recombinant protein therapy has been tested in rodent models with PH (10) ACE2 ser680 phosphorylation likely enhances ACE2 stability by inhibiting ubiquitin-related proteasomal degradation. cross-talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination is prevalent in gene regulation at the post-translational level. ser680 phosphorylation affected eNOS-derived NO bioavailability. phosphorylation of ACE2 ser680 mediated the expression of several PH-related genes. NO inhibits EDN1 transcription, receptor binding, and release from the endothelium via cGMP-dependent pathways. the role of AMPK phosphorylation of ACE2 in PH is mediated at least in part by a paradigm shift of the RAS. in line with the notion that the AMPK\u2013p-ACE2 axis is protective against PH, several AMPK activators have shown therapeutic benefit in PH. AMPK2 has a catalytic preference toward a panel of molecules important for EC homeostasis (14, 48, 49) in the pulmonary vessels, endothelial function largely affects the homeostasis of the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through ECs releasing various bioactive molecules such as NO, EDN1 and angiotensin (50, 51) ACE2 has recently been shown to improve cardiomyopathy through activation of AMPK (52 authors acknowledge Dr. Tzu-Pin Shentu, Jane Yanjin Li, and Jeff Smith at the university of California, San Diego, and Dr. Liang Bai and Baochang Lai at the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, for their technical assistance. authors also thank Dr. Randy Cowling at the university of California, San Diego, and Drs. shemin Lu, Jia Liu, Juan Zhou, and Zhao Li at the Xi"}
