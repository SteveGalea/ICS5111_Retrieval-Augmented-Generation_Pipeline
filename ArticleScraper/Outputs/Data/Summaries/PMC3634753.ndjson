{"summary": "traditional molecular chaperones can be classified according to their molecular weights and sequences to families such as HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and nucleoplasmin. they are capable of assisting nascent peptides in correctly folding to functional proteins by binding to the folding intermediate to avoid kinetic traps, suppressing aggregation of the substrate. kinase (HCK) is a protein of important physiological function. it is closely related to intracellular energy operation, muscle contraction and ATP regeneration. antibodies produced by using HCK expressed in E. coli as antigen could be used to study the renaturation of inclusion bodies. the number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein interactions was so large that no current software can correctly dock two proteins ab initio. one approach to reduce the search space for protein-protein interactions is to predict protein-protein interaction sites first and then use the orientational docking method to test the possibility of the binding. molecule docking software packages were used to generate 3D models for the scFv-antigen complexes. first, the three-dimensional structure of scFv-A4 was constructed by the homology modeling method. then potential epitopes of scFv-A4 were predicted by software tools and the peptide array membrane experiment. for 87.65% residues the 3D\u20131D compatibility score is greater than 0.2 by Verify-3D [29] the amino acids with scores less than 0.2 were GLY112-LYS142 which belonged to the linker segment. since no template was used for modeling the linker the poorer model result of this area was expected. peptides picked from first set in which first amino acid sequence numbers were odd number. each set corresponds to a peptide segment of HCK. eight epitopes were predicted by both methods. four peptides fell in the N-terminal domain, one fell in the linker area and three fell in the C-terminal domain. lys170-MET179 and LYS265-ASN274 were positive in both methods. the six peptides were screened out by the peptide array experiment. it was interesting because it agreed with the bioinformatics prediction that they were not epitopes. lys170-MET179 and LYS265-ASN274 could be docked to scFv-A4. complex models generated by ZDOCK were redocked by RosettaDock. the results were ranked by docking scores. we discarded models in which binding sites of the antibody were outside the CDR regions and picked the best complex models by the best rank scores. for 87.65% residues the 3D\u20131D compatibility score is greater than 0.2 by Verify-3D [29] the amino acids with scores less than 0.2 were GLY112-LYS142 which belonged to the linker segment. the poorer model result of this area was expected. peptides were picked from first set in which first amino acid sequence numbers were odd number. each set corresponds to a peptide segment of HCK. peptides were potential binding sites for all antibodies. eight overlapping epitopes were predicted by both methods. four peptides fell in the N-terminal domain, one fell in the linker area and three fell in the C-terminal domain. formatics predictions, we did orientational docking for all of the six peptides screened out by the peptide array experiment. it was interesting because it agreed with the bioinformatics prediction that they were not epitopes. the first three peptides were embedded inside the HCK monomers. complex models generated by ZDOCK were redocked by RosettaDock. we discarded models in which binding sites of the antibody were outside the CDR regions and picked the best complex models by the best rank scores. scFv-A4 showed strong chaperone-like activity. bioinformatics software tools were used to predict interacting sites between scFv-A4 and HCK. results were combined with peptide array membrane experiment results. two antigen-antibody model complexes were screened out as the final result. scFv-A4 exerts its chaperone-like function on HCK, on the folding intermediate or on the folded HCK. scFv-A4 bound to the opposite site of HCK thus has not impact on these residues. in complex model-I, scFv-A4 exhibits chaperone-like function by assisting the folding of HCK and stabilizing the folded conformation. in complex model-I, scFv-A4 would not significantly interfere with the major folding path ways of the two terminal domains. the traditional method of studying antigen-antibody interactions is by constructing many antigen mutants and observing changes of the binding activity. the combination of the peptide array membrane technique with bioinfomatics methods could be a more efficient approach for epitope mapping. both chains of the Fab were used as templates for building the 3D model of scFv-A4 by Modeller 9v7 [44]. the linker was modeled without an appropriate template. optimization work was focused on the linker. mer peptides from the HCK sequence were synthesized on nitrocellulose membrane as individual spots. the peptide array membrane was incubated with purified scFv-A4 antibodies in the MP buffer. the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h. scFv-A4 residues of the linker segment were selected as blocking residues. the sequence of scFv-A4 was used to do a BLAST search in the non-redundant protein sequences database of NCBI. the linker structure was modeled without an appropriate template. the DOPE-based loop modeling protocol was used to optimize the linker structure. the peptide array membrane was incubated with purified scFv-A4 antibodies. the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h. the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for 1 hour. was used to optimize models build by ZDOCK because it implemented the flexible docking method. the perturbation docking method of the RosettaDock program was applied."}
