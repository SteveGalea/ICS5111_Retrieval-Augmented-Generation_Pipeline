{"summary": "lectins are a diverse group of proteins broadly defined as non-immunoglobulin proteins that exhibit high avidity for glycoprotein- and/or glycolipid-associated carbohydrates, but display no enzymatic activity. phylogenetic studies indicated that the primitive immune system depended on lectin-protease-mediated opsonophagocytosis. lectins act as pattern-recognition receptors, recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns. this can lead to the induction of an immune response against the invading pathogen. but the relationship between lectins and viruses is complex. many viruses have evolved mechanisms to exploit lectins to enhance infection. lectin pathway involves binding of microbial surface carbohydrate moieties to serum lectins. lectin pathway activates lectin-bound MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and proteins (MAPs) sMAP and MAP-1 are truncated MASP proteins lacking serine protease domains. sMAP and MAP-1 are truncated MASP proteins lacking serine protease domains. sMAP and MAP-1 may inhibit MASP-2 activation by the disruption of inter-MASP and lectin-MASP co-complexes. sMAP and MAP-1 are truncated MASP proteins lacking serine protease domains. sMAP and MAP-1 are truncated MASP proteins lacking serine protease domains. if these complexes are separate, binding sites of MASP-2 and MASP-1 and -3 on the lectin are likely to be within close proximity. MBL monomers are 32 kDa in molecular weight and possess a typical collectin structure. they form homotrimeric subunits that further oligomerise into trimeric to hexameric structures. ficolins possess 3/2 N-terminal cysteines and a lysine in its CLD. Oligomeric MBL arranges into a sertiform structure with trimeric subunits stretching out from the short, bundled N-terminal regions. a short amino acid sequence after the first 7 N-terminal Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats creates a \u201ckink\u201d bend in the CLD. this is only seen in a minority of MBL molecules in vivo and does not influence MBL activity [30,32]. MBL interacts with several strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) via its spatially conserved, high mannose-type, N-linked glycosylated gp120 envelope glycoprotein [38] MBL does not neutralise HIV-1 through complement activation, even at concentrations far exceeding physiological serum levels. the same viral glycoprotein-mediated complement-dependent/independent mechanisms are employed by MBL to neutralise influenza A virus (IAV) [45,46], hepatitis C virus (47), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [48,49], dengue virus (DV) and west Nile virus (WNV) [50,51] infection in vitro. MBL can indirectly activate coagulation upon pathogen binding, perhaps via MASP-1 recruitment. termed MBL-B, -C and -D are products of amino acid substitutions in codons 54 [58], 57 [59] and 52 [60] which disrupt Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats. the mutations are N-terminal to the CLD kink whereas the MASP-binding sites are C-terminal. some african and south american populations have low serum MBL levels. 7 common haplotypes have been described, each with different serum levels of MBL ranging from 0.01 g/mL to >5 g/mL, with an average of 1.7 g/mL [61,68]. both excessively high and low serum levels are associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. +1 represents the A of the ATG translation start site for all genes except MBL2. +1 represents the transcription start site, to comply with literature. rs10117466 144 C A Promoter - Increased serum concentration [93] rs10441778 +1435 G A Exon 2 Gly43Asp Likely affects structure and oligomerisation [94] ss76901539 +3458 G A Exon 4 Arg93Gln Likely affects structure and oligomerisation [94] rs148649884 +6658 G A Exon 8 Ala218Thr Reduced affects ligand binding [94] ss76901571 +4987 G A Exon 6 Arg157Gln Likely affects ligand binding [94] rs17549193 +6359 C T Exon 8 Thr236Met Reduced binding to GlcNAc [94] and PTX3 [96]. correlations between MBL-B homozygotes and the 221 SNP with susceptibility to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection have been observed [84,92]. some studies suggested that MBL variants do not influence susceptibility to HCV infection [110,111] or disease progression [112], while others show an association with HCV infection, disease progression and treatment response [82,83,89,112]. MBL monomers are 32 kDa in molecular weight and possess a typical collectin structure. monomers form homotrimeric subunits that further oligomerise into trimeric to hexameric structures. ficolins possess 3/2 N-terminal cysteines and a lysine in its CLD. a short amino acid sequence after the first 7 N-terminal Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats creates a \u201ckink\u201d bend in the CLD. a short amino acid sequence after the first 7 N-terminal Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats creates a \u201ckink\u201d bend in the CLD. this is only seen in a minority of MBL molecules in vivo. MBL interacts with several strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) via its spatially conserved, high mannose-type, N-linked glycosylated gp120 envelope glycoprotein. MBL does not neutralise HIV-1 through complement activation, even at concentrations far exceeding physiological serum levels. the same viral glycoprotein-mediated complement-dependent/independent mechanisms are employed by MBL to neutralise influenza A virus (IAV) [45,46], hepatitis C virus (47), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [48,49], dengue virus (DV) and west Nile virus (WNV) [50,51] infection in vitro. MBL neutralises the virus in vitro and in vivo via complement activation [53], phagocytosis, and direct inhibition of glycoprotein interaction with the DC-SIGN/L-SIGN receptor. but MBL may have pro-viral effects, enhancing EBOV infection by mediating macropinocytosis in low complement conditions, perhaps via the C1QBP cell receptor [55]. the mutations are N-terminal to the CLD kink whereas the MASP-binding sites are C-terminal. the decreased affinity for MASPs is an indirect result of the destabilisation of the CLD [20]. the -221 SNP has been correlated with increased risk of perinatal HIV-1 infection [74], whereas higher MBL levels conferred protection. some studies found no association between variant alleles and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [76] and disease progression [77,78] rs7096206 (X/Y) 221 C G Promoter - HBV [81], HCV [82,83], HIV [72,75], HTLV [84], SARS-CoV [48] rs7095891 (P/Q) +4 C T 5\u2019 UTR - rs5030737 (MBL-D) +223 C T Exon 1 Arg52Cys CMV [85,86], DV[50], HBV ala218Thr Reduced serum concentration, reduced ligand binding [93] rs150625869 +7895 T C Exon 9 Ser268Pro Abolished serum concentration [93] rs1071583 +7918 G A Exon 9 - ss76901546 +7929 G A Exon 9 Trp279STOP Likely affects structure and oligomerisation [94] rs138055828 +7959 A G Exon 9 Gly correlations between MBL-B homozygotes and the 221 SNP with susceptibility to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection have been observed [84,92]. one study associated MBL-B and -D with protection against HCV infection. MBL-C is associated with chronic hepatitis B disease progression [91], whereas MBL-D displayed a Caucasian-specific association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence [87]. some studies found no association between variant alleles and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [76] and disease progression [77,78]. some studies suggest a protective effect against HIV-1 disease progression conferred by the variant alleles [80] HIV [70,72,73,80], HTLV [92], SARS-CoV [48] rs1800451 (MBL-C) +239 G A Exon 1 Gly57Glu CMV [85,86], DV [50], HBV [88], HCV [82,83,89,90], HIV [70,72,80] FCN1 rs2989727 1981 G A Promoter - rs10120023 542 G A Promoter 602 G A Promoter - Increased serum concentration [94]; HBV [95] ss76901565 +4423 C T Exon 5 Arg103Cys Likely affects chemical and structural properties [94] ss76901566 +4526 C T Exon 5 Thr137Met Likely affects chemical and structural properties [94] ss76901566 +4526 C T Exon 5 Thr137Met Likely affects chemical and structural properties [94] rs11465366 201 C A Promoter - HIV [104,106] rs2287886 139 T C Promoter - HIV [106,108] rs41374747 +660 G A Exon 4 Arg198Gln HIV [104] rs11465380 +791 C G Exon 4 Leu242Val HIV [104] The MBL variants may also influence Dengue virus infection and disease progression [50] genetics, structure, expression and binding Specificities of Ficolins. ficolins differ in several ways, for example in their localisation in the human body. the human ficolins differ in several ways, for example in their localisation in the human body. active, oligomeric L-ficolin and M-ficolin are dodecamers. ficolin homotrimers are stabilised by interactions between hydrophobic residues in the CLDs [31,127] and oligomerise by inter-monomer and -trimer disulphide bridges between the N-terminal cysteine residues. ligand specificities conferred by sequence differences in binding site\u2014S1\u2014near the Ca2+-binding site of the FBG [135]. ficolins indirectly activate the lytic complement pathway via MASP activation, induce phagocytosis by opsonisation, and stimulate the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages [137]. recombinant oligomeric L-ficolin neutralised HCV entry in a dose-dependent manner by preventing E2 interaction with cell surface lipoprotein receptor and scavenger receptor B1. monomeric L-ficolin directly inhibits IAV entry and promote complement-mediated lysis of infected cells. a candidate receptor of M-ficolin is G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPCR43) which indirectly activates IL-8 production. serum M-ficolin binds sialic acid on capsulated Streptococcus agalactiae via its FBG domain. but L- and H-ficolin were found not to interact with this pathogen. only leu117fs, Thr125Ala and Val287Ala are predicted to affect H-ficolin function. 5 of the 36 SNPs in the FCN2 gene have been identified. ficolin levels were higher in patients with acute rather than chronic HBV infection, suggesting that the protein is directly involved in immediate clearance of the virus. the Thr236Met mutation reduced affinity towards pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a serum protein which enhances L-ficolin-mediated complement response to Aspergillus fumigatus, suggesting that FCN2 polymorphisms also alter affinity towards cooperative proteins and thus affect the immune response. the 144C SNP has been associated with increased M-ficolin serum levels. the 1981A and +7918 SNPs were correlated with rheumatoid arthritis. no studies have correlated H-ficolin SNPs with infectious diseases. s exhibit the highest or lowest levels whereas heterozygotes display intermediate levels of ficolin [149]. chronic HCV-infected patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels correlated with ALT levels. ALT is a known marker of fibrosis and inflammation [162]. PTX3 required C1q to enhance activation of the classical complement pathway. PTX3 interacts with MBL and ficolins with other immune proteins. natural antibodies are produced without prior exposure to infection or immunisation. a pH- and calcium-sensitive binding site on the ficolin FBG domain enables binding to CRP [171]. Later phase infection-inflammation conditions also enhance interaction between membrane GPCR43-associated M-ficolin and CRP. thus blocking M-ficolin binding of PAMPs and curtailing GPCR43-mediated IL-8 production. active, oligomeric L-ficolin and M-ficolin are dodecamers. active, oligomeric L-ficolin and M-ficolin are dodecamers. active, oligomeric L-ficolin and M-ficolin are dodecamers. ficolins bind GlcNAc and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), but not mannose and lactose. ligand specificities conferred by sequence differences in binding site\u2014S1\u2014near the Ca2+-binding site of the FBG [135]. ficolins indirectly activate the lytic complement pathway via MASP activation, induce phagocytosis by opsonisation, and stimulate the production and secretion L-ficolin interacts with viruses via N-linked glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins. binding of HCV triggers infected-cell lysis via C4 deposition. if the HCV E2 glycoprotein is not glycosylated, L-ficolin interaction is abrogated. the majority of M-ficolin is monocyte and granulocyte membrane-bound. the majority of M-ficolin is membrane-bound, despite its lack of a transmembrane (TM) domain. a candidate receptor of M-ficolin is G-protein-coupled receptor 43. the FCN1 gene contains 45 SNPs, nine of which are exclusive to african populations. only leu117fs, Thr125Ala and Val287Ala are predicted to affect H-ficolin function. NP +1637delC of FCN3 encodes a truncated H-ficolin protein that cannot be expressed. this leads to full H-ficolin deficiency in homozygotes, causing high levels of lung infection and disease, and severe necrotising enterocolitis. ficolin levels were higher in patients with acute rather than chronic HBV infection. the 144C SNP is associated with protection against M. leprae-associated leprosy. the 1981A and +7918 SNPs were correlated with rheumatoid arthritis. expression of the FCN1 gene is up-regulated in chronic HCV patients. no studies have correlated H-ficolin SNPs with infectious diseases. homozygotes for particular SNPs exhibit the highest or lowest levels. heterozygotes display intermediate levels of ficolin [149] ficolin gene polymorphisms are associated with protection against HBV infection. ficolin levels were higher in patients with acute rather than chronic HBV infection. the protein is directly involved in immediate clearance of the virus, and influences subsequent liver disease. the 144C SNP has been associated with increased M-ficolin serum levels. the 1981A and +7918 SNPs were correlated with rheumatoid arthritis. no studies have correlated H-ficolin SNPs with infectious diseases. ALT is a known marker of fibrosis and inflammation. higher L-ficolin serum concentrations also confer protective effects against microorganism-induced inflammation in allergic respiratory disease. natural antibodies are produced without prior exposure to infection or immunisation, and are important in the protection of individuals exposed to pathogens for first time. PTX3 interacts with L-ficolin to enhance its binding of Aspergillus fumigatus and its induction of C4 deposition. this allows indirect nIgG-based phagocytosis via nIgG-based opsonisation. DC-SIGN 5.1 is encoding the membrane-bound lectin L-SIGN (DC-SIGNR), a protein that is highly homologous to DC-SIGN. this protein blocks binding of PAMPs and curts GPCR43-mediated IL-8 production. DC-SIGN interaction is mediated by the transient interaction of DC-SIGN with ICAM-3. the level of DC-SIGN expression is important to optimal virus binding. DC-SIGN preferentially binds fucosylated and high mannose-type oligosaccharides. each cell type causes subtle changes in the glycosylation profile of viral glycoproteins. DC-SIGN neutralises HIV-1 infection through increased DC-SIGN signalosome-mediated cytokine production and degradation of virions. DC-SIGN then aids dendritic cell apoptosis via ASK-1, enhance viral replication via the DC-SIGN signalosome and enhance HIV-1 trans-infection of T-cells. HIV-1 Nef may prevent DC-SIGN-bound HIV-1 internalisation to enhance trans-infection. other lectins are implicated in HIV-1 trans-infection. a feature of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the gradual depletion of DC levels, increasing the risk of opportunistic infection. EBOV [198], EBOV [199], IAV [200], HCV [201] and CMV [202] use DC-SIGN as a glycoprotein-mediated attachment and internalisation receptor. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in viral interaction and polymorphisms, as the neck region of L-SIGN is highly variable and polymorphic. the CD209 gene only displays 2% variant heterozygosity. the prototypic 7.5 neck region repeat allele is present in 99% of the global population. different DC-SIGN isoforms can be found on same cell surface and can affect DC-SIGN multimerisation. the 336 GG/AG genotypes increase susceptibility to dengue haemorrhagic fever. the 139G allele is associated with protection against HIV-1 infection. 336C is implicated in higher susceptibility to parenteral HIV-1 infection. active, tetrameric DC-SIGN (Figure 3d) is organised on DC surfaces in nanoclusters. the level of DC-SIGN expression is important to optimal virus binding. this is partly explains the relatively more efficient HIV-1 binding exhibited by DCs rather than other DC-SIGN+ cells. IGN-mediated HIV-1 infection utilises DC-SIGN+ cells to transport virions from sites of HIV-1 exposure to CD4+ T-cell targets in the lymphoid tissues. most HIV-1 virions are shuttled to the proteasome, aided by the interaction of the cytoskeletal phosphoprotein LSP1 with HIV-1-bound DC-SIGN, where it is degraded for MHC class II presentation to T-cells. DC-SIGN-bound, intact HIV-1 virions are non-fusogenically internalised into a specialised, non-lysosomal, low-pH endosome. if an HIV-1 virion is degraded or maintained in a DC is dependent on several factors, including the N-linked glycan composition of gp120 [190] a feature of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the gradual depletion of DC levels, increasing the risk of opportunistic infection [196]. gp120-DC-SIGN interaction in certain conditions to prime the DC for apoptosis. many viruses use DC-SIGN as an attachment factor and for trans-infection. soluble sDC-SIGN (sDC-SIGN) has been detected in bodily fluids and the cytoplasm of some DC-SIGN+ cells. it is unknown how the protein is secreted. sDC-SIGN interacts with sDC-SIGN via its gB glycoprotein. the 336G SNP and AA genotype confer protection against DV-based dengue fever [100,101], perhaps due to reduced transcription factor binding and activity [107], decreased susceptibility of DCs to infection and the suppression of symptoms [102]. 139, 201 and 336 SNPs are also implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV-1 [104,106]. soluble pulmonary collectins SP-A and SP-D both inhibit IAV haemagglutinin activity by viral aggregation and enhancement of the neutrophil immune response. SP-A also has roles in enhancing phagocytosis via the host SP-A receptor 210. lectin langerin is expressed on the surface of Langerhans cells, an epithelial DC subset, and binds the mannose-containing glycans of gp120 [226]. Unlike DC-SIGN, langerin mediates internalisation into Birbeck granules for viral degradation and antigen presentation while efficiently preventing HIV-1 transmission. active MBL/L-ficolin RCLs formed dodecamers, and RCL2 (L-FCN/MBL76) exhibited stronger MBL CRD-mediated ligand binding. physiological levels of RCL2 neutralised EBOV pseudotype infection, and moderately neutralised Hendra and Nipah virus infection. acetylated sugars are potential targets for direct entry inhibition and viral clearance by L-ficolin administration. there are no documented HCV strains resistant to the antiviral effects of the ficolins. synthetic antibiotic pradimicin S act as CBA inhibitors of HIV-1 interaction with DC-SIGN in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. these lectins have potential uses in antiviral microbicides and have elicited non-toxic and non-immunogenic HIV-1 neutralisation. GRFT also has antiviral activity against HCV [249], SARS-CoV and several coronaviruses in vitro. a linker-extended and PEGylated CV-N was produced to extend the protein\u2019s half-life, dampen its immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, and yet maintain its antiviral activity. GRFT elicits a far greater anti-HIV-1 effect than CV-N and SVN, and does not cause significant mitogenic, inflammatory, cytotoxic or irritant effects. antiviral efficacy of RCLs consisting of the structurally similar lectins MBL and L-ficolin has been studied. RCL2 (L-FCN/MBL76) exhibited stronger MBL CRD-mediated ligand binding. physiological levels of RCL2 neutralised EBOV pseudotype infection. ficolins have not been used clinically as antiviral therapies. acetylated sugars are potential targets for direct entry inhibition. there are no documented HCV strains resistant to antiviral effects of the ficolins. cyanovirin-N, scytovirin (SVN), scytovirin (SVN), pradimicin S act as CBA inhibitors of HIV-1 interaction with DC-SIGN in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. these lectins have potential uses in antiviral microbicides and have elicited non-toxic and non-immunogenic HIV-1 neutralisation in mammals. a linker-extended and PEGylated CV-N was produced to extend the protein\u2019s half-life, dampen its immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. GRFT elicits a far greater anti-HIV-1 effect than CV-N and SVN. despite the possibility that GRFT is not sufficiently stable for therapeutic administration, subcutaneously-administered GRFT remained active in mice for several days after injection, with minimal adverse effects."}
