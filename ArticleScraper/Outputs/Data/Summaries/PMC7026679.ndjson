{"summary": "antibiotics abuse in domestic animal feeding has been a major threat to animal health and welfare as well as the environment. probiotics have positive effects on preventing certain diseases and maintaining good health. probiotics have been used in pig feed for improving the immune status by reducing harmful microbes in their intestines. the Greater Khingan Mountains are located in the northernmost prefecture administrative region in china. it is expected to isolate probiotic strains with natural and excellent characteristics. there are few studies on probiotics from wild boar. the GI tract samples including the duodenum, ileum, cecum, and colon were obtained from a healthy wild boar of the Greater Khingan Mountains immediately after slaughter. the serum sample of the wild boar was confirmed to be negative for common porcine viruses, including swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine circovirus type the identification of isolates was analyzed based on the 16S rDNA gene amplification using a bacterial genome extraction kit (Tiangen, China) the sequences for the amplified 16S rDNA were searched using Blast in the NCBI databases to compare with the registered sequences. the isolates were cultured in MRS medium at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. the cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 15 min. the cultures were washed 3 times using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 2 ml PBS to an OD600nm of 0.25 0.05. the bacterial pellets from an overnight culture were washed 3 times in PBS. each pellet was then resuspended to a concentration of 108 CFU/ml in PBS. the monolayers of cells were washed 4 times with PBS. 1% of each pathogen strain (107 CFU/ml) was inoculated into 15 ml of 0.8% (w/v) of BHI agar at 45\u201350\u00b0C. four Oxford cups (6 mm) were put on the BHI agar surface and 100 l of culture was poured into three. the fourth was used as a control (100 l of sterile water) amplicon size (bp) Tm (\u00b0C) References Ace F: CAGGCCAACATCAAGCAACA 125 65 (32) R: GCTTGCCTCGCCTTCTACAA Agg F: AAGAAAAAGAAGTAGACCAAC 1,553 53 (33) R: AAACGGCAAGACAAGTAAATA Asa1 F: GCACGCTATTACGAACTATGA 375 56 (35) R: GGTAAGGCCGTCATTGAACC Cfa erythromycin (15 g), streptomycin (10 g), cefotaxime (30 g), kanamycin (30 g), cefradine (30 g), gentamicin (10 g), amoxicillin (10 g), chloramphenicol (30 g), clindamycin (2 g), ampicillin (10 g), cotrimoxazole (25 g), tetracycline (30 g), ceftazidime (30 the resistance of the LAB strains was interpreted using the principles of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2014). in vivo safety evaluation Five groups of 5 mice each were orally administered with isolates M5-8, M6-29, M4-7, M2-71, or M2-3 at a concentration of 109 CFU/100 l. a control group of mice were fed with 100 l PBS. caco-2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM), 20% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) the GI tract samples were obtained from a healthy wild boar of the Greater Khingan Mountains immediately after slaughter in a commercial slaughterhouse. isolated bacteria were grown overnight in MRS medium and spotted onto MRS agar plates. all the isolated bacteria were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u201348 h. a bacterial genome extraction kit was performed using a previously described method. the growth rate was calculated as follows: % of growth = Growth in bile salt medium/Growth in control medium 100. the isolates were cultured in MRS medium at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. bacterial pellets from an overnight culture were washed 3 times in PBS. labeled bacteria were washed 4 times with PBS. each well of 24-well tissue culture plates was added 0.1 ml of trypsin. LAB isolates were cultured in MRS medium for 18\u201324 h at 37\u00b0C. bacterial inhibition rings on plates were measured using a vernier caliper. virulence factors were listed in Table 1 (32\u201339) for the virulence factors. PCR primers and the annealing temperatures used to detect the putative virulence genes in isolated LAB strains. erythromycin (15 g), streptomycin (10 g), cefotaxime (30 g), kanamycin (30 g), cefradine (30 g), gentamicin (10 g), amoxicillin (10 g), chloramphenicol (30 g), clindamycin (2 g), ampicillin (10 g), cotrimoxazole (25 g), tetracycline (30 g), ceftazidime (30 the antibiotics susceptibility was tested for all the isolated LAB strains. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h and then the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured. the appearance of clear zones around the bacteria colonies was indicated as -, - or -hemolysis. a1 F: GCACGCTATTACGAACTATGA 375 56 (34) R: CCAGGTCGTGAAGCTTATCC 110 63 (35) R: GGTAAGGCCGTCATTGAACC Cfa 1 F: ACGACCTGTTGTTCGACCTG 150 63 (35) R: ACGACCTGTTGTTCGACCTG Cpd F: TGGGGGGATTTTTCAATTC 782 50 (36) R: TACGGCTCTGTTTT resistance of the LAB strains was interpreted using the guiding principles of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2014) 192 pure bacterial colonies were obtained from various GI compartments of wild boar. these colonies were isolated from the jejunum and duodenum (71 isolates), the ileum (2 isolates), the ileocecal apertures (23 isolates), the cecum (35 isolates), and the colon (61 isolates), respectively. the results revealed that there are 156 LAB isolates that belonged to five species.

LAB isolates showed no hemolytic activity and none of the isolated Enterococcus strains harbored virulence factors genes. the antibiotic resistance of the LAB isolates against 15 tested antibiotics was shown in Table 4. compared with control group, no significant difference was observed in BWG of mice treated with various isolates on days 7 and 14. the percentage of BWG of the mice treated with various isolates was significantly higher (P 0.05) than that of the control mice on day 21. LAB have been used as probiotics to treat intestinal diseases in humans and animals since they promote host intestinal health by developing a balance of intestinal microbes. bile salt in the duodenum and the acid condition of the stomach has been reported as the biggest obstacles to the survival of LAB in the GI tract of host. the LAB isolated from wild boar colonized in their host intestinal tract. it is expected that these LAB isolates could be more adaptable to internal environment than other LAB. Enterococcus are also autochthonous flora in the GI tract of host. the ability to autoaggregate and coaggregate pathogens could be beneficial to the intestinal health. the high coaggregation level can facilitate the presence of these strains in the intestinal tract of animals. the adhesion ability to mucosal surfaces and epithelial cells is a crucial feature of probiotics. isolated strains should have antimicrobial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic microorganisms. LAB is safe to use with a long history, but potential virulence-associated factors must be considered and assessed. the antibiotic resistance in these beneficial microbes is thought to be beneficial to the survival of antibiotics in the GI tract. the probiotics with endogenous resistance can restore intestinal flora after antibiotic treatment (65). the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
