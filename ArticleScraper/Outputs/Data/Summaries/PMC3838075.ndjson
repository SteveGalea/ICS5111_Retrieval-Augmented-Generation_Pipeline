{"summary": "clinical signs of CIRD range from nasal discharge and a dry cough to bronchopneumonia and, in severe cases, death (3). novel viral agents have been identified (4\u20137), many of which have since been shown to be important in the development of CIRD. bovine RSV is of particular importance as a primary agent in the multifactorial bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) it is a natural pathogen of rodents, common in research and commercial rodent colonies (20) but little is known about its natural host range or its association with disease among wild rodent populations. Archived tissue and serum samples collected from dogs housed at a well-established rehoming kennel with a history of endemic CIRD were analyzed. all dogs were vaccinated upon entry into the kennel with a live attenuated vaccine for distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine parvovirus. version was determined from day 1 and day 21 serological results. the health of each dog had been assessed twice daily by a veterinary clinician. respiratory signs were scored as follows: 1, no respiratory signs; 2, mild cough; 3, cough and nasal discharge; 4, cough, nasal discharge, and inappetence. the length of time each dog was housed in the kennel at the time of euthanasia was recorded in days. the length of time each dog was housed in the kennel was recorded in days and collapsed into categories of 0 to 7, 8 to 14, 15 to 21, 22 to 28, and >28 days. tracheal samples were tested for the presence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene. a standard control comprising the target 100-bp fragment of the MPV nucleocapsid gene was used. ISA plates were coated with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) plates were washed 3 with 100 l/well of 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline\u2013Tween (PBST) and then blocked for 1 h with 100 l/well of 5% milk powder with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-0.1% PBST. the cutoff value was calculated by adding three standard deviations to the corrected OD value of a panel of 10 negative-control sera diluted 1:100. the sera had been previously tested for the presence of CnPnV antibodies by virus neutralization assay (VN) Archived tissue and serum samples collected from dogs housed at a well-established rehoming kennel with a history of endemic CIRD were analyzed. the estimated age (years), preentry housing status (gifts or strays), date of entry, and date of sample collection had been recorded for each dog. the occurrence of seroconversion was determined from day 1 and day 21 serological results. the health of each dog had been assessed twice daily by a veterinary clinician. the maximum respiratory score recorded for each dog during the 21-day study period was recategorized to indicate the occurrence of any clinical disease. 205 dogs were analyzed for the presence of CnPnV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. the dogs had been euthanized by a veterinary clinician on the day of euthanasia. the health status of each dog had been assessed by a veterinary clinician on the day of euthanasia. tracheal samples were tested for the presence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene. a standard control comprising the target 100-bp fragment of the MPV nucleocapsid gene was used. ELISA plates were coated with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) ELISA antigen or control antigen. plates were washed 3 with 100 l/well of 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline\u2013Tween. they were then blocked for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 100 l/well of 5% milk powder. samples were regarded as positive if corrected OD values were greater than or equal to the cutoff value. the cutoff value was calculated by adding three standard deviations to the corrected OD value of a panel of 10 negative-control sera diluted 1:100. the sera had been previously tested for the presence of CnPnV antibodies by virus neutralization assay (VN) kenneled dogs in the virological survey examined associations between the presence of CnPnV in tissues and respiratory score at euthanasia, presence of respiratory disease, presence of severe respiratory disease, histology score, age, and presence of other viral agents. chi-square/Fisher's exact tests were used to examine relationships between length of time in kennels. the results from England were further broken down by county. % CnPnV positive dogs England 517 270 52.2 Wales 36 13 36.1 Scotland (Ayrshire and Lanarkshire) 13 7 53.9 Guernsey 6 2 33.3. 1.8 0.7\u20134.5 0.2 41 100 3 103 77.4 30 22.6 5.3 2.4\u201311.8 0.001 133 100 4 7 87.5 1 12.5 10.8 1.2\u201398.0 0.04 8 100 Disease Yes 132 72.5 50 27.5 4.1 1.9\u20138.8 0.001 182 100 No 13 39.4 20 60.6 Ref 0.001b 33 100 Severe disease Yes 110 78.0 31 22.0 4.0 2.2\u20137.2 0.001 141 100 80% (n = 56/70) had preexisting antibodies on the day of entry. proportion of dogs with preexisting antibodies decreased.

CIRD was endemic in the kennel studied and could not be controlled through the use of recommended vaccines. antibodies to CnPnV were prevalent in pet dogs throughout the united kingdom and the republic of Ireland. there was no discernible difference in the proportion of dogs that seroconverted to CnPnV. the gifted or stray status of the dog prior to entry is therefore not an indicator of preexposure to or susceptibility to CnPnV within the kennel. the above-described findings indicate that CnPnV was strongly associated with respiratory disease during the early stages of CIRD onset. but a defined role for CnPnV in the pathogenesis of CIRD remains to be determined. other Pneumovirinae have been reported to act as primary agents of disease and within associated disease complexes. mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus have also been detected in these kenneled dogs during the later stages of disease (weeks 3 to 4). studies to determine the prevalence of other viral and bacterial pathogens are under way. Elucidating the involvement of these viruses in CIRD could reveal new ways of treating and managing this disease."}
