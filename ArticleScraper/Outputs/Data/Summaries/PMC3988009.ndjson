{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating pathology of the central nervous system presenting a serious medical and social problem. the most valid theory of its pathogenesis assigns the main role in the destruction of myelin-proteolipid shell of axons to inflammation related with autoimmune reactions. auto-antibodies (auto-Abs) from the sera of patients with different autoimmune diseases can possess enzymatic activities. it is thought that abzymes may play a significant role in forming specific pathogenic patterns and clinical settings in different autoimmune conditions. anti-DNA Abs were found to be a major component of the intrathecal IgG response in MS patients [2]. it was shown that IgGs and IgMs from the sera of MS patients effectively hydrolyzed DNA, RNA, and oligosaccharides [24]\u2013[28]. compared with healthy donors, DNase abzymes were found in 80\u201390% of patients. MRI activity = presence or absence gadolinium enhancing lesions at MRI examination. MRI activity = presence or absence gadolinium enhancing lesions at MRI examination. the relative concentration of total protein, IgGs, and anti-DNA antibodies in CSF and sera of patients with MS.* was 167-fold higher than that for the CSF (range 0.02\u20130.19 mg/ml; average value 0.070.04 mg/ml) there was not good correlation between these values, CC = +0.07. a mean of three measurements is reported; the error of the determination of values did not exceed 7\u201310%. different dilution CSF (2-fold) and serum (1000-fold) preparations were used; relative content was recalculated for initial undiluted CSFs and sera. the relative low A450 values corresponding to untreated CSFs are caused by anti-DNA antibodies in these CSFs. the correlation was very low between the total concentration of IgGs and anti-DNA antibodies in the sera and the serum. the average concentration of the total protein in the serum was 130-fold higher than in the serum. SDS-PAGE analysis of total proteins corresponding to the sera (40 g) (A) and CSFs (30 g) (B) of several MS patients in a nonreducing gradient gel followed by Coomassie staining. relative DNase activity of total protein preparations corresponding to serum (C) and CSF (D) of several patients. the measured RAs were normalized to standard conditions (pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h; standard units (SU)) the measured RAs were normalized to standard conditions (pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h; standard units (SU) the relative specific DNase activity of total protein of the serum preparations was varied in the range 0.26\u20130.88 pmole DNA/1 mg of protein/1 h (average value 0.510.16 SU) concentration of total protein in the case of CSF was 130-fold lower than that of sera (Table 2). the homogeneity of the 150 kDa IgGmix was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. it showed a single band before, and two bands corresponding to the H and L chains after Ab reduction with DTT (silver staining) the gel-filtration of one IgGmix did not lead to the disappearance of Ab activity. a complete hydrolysis of 20 g/ml scDNA for 4 h was taken for 100%. the error in the initial rate determination from two experiments in each case did not exceed 7\u201310%. the RAs of IgGs from sera and CSF varied markedly from patient to patient. we compared the RAs in the hydrolysis of DNA of IgGs from sera and CSFs of thirteen MS patients. incubated without Abs mark the positions of supercoiled (scDNA) and relax DNA plasmid (relDNA) are shown. average specific RAs of serum IgGs are 22-fold higher than those of serum total proteins, while this difference in case of serum total proteins is only 5.4-fold. a small specific fraction of anti-DNA Abs from the sera may be 10-fold more active (totally 485-fold) than a similar small fraction of Abs interacting with DNA from the sera. abzymes of MS patients may be significantly more active in the hydrolysis of DNA than what we have found. healthy mice with DNA also leads to a production of Abs with DNase activity. but it is only associated with increased lymphocyte proliferation and suppression of apoptosis of lymphocytes in different organs (especially spleen) CC between concentration of IgGs and relative specific DNase activity of CSF Abs was relatively low in CSF (CC = +0.16; columns 3 and 5) and negative in the sera (CC = 0.32; columns 4 and 6) (Tables 1 and 3). CC between concentration of IgGs and relative specific DNase activity of CSF Abs (CC = +0.16; columns 3 and 11) was lower than that of the sera (CC = 0.58; columns 4 and 12) the absence of a definite dependence between titers of anti-DNA and anti-MBP Abs and these parameters with standard clinical indices may be due to several reasons. the absence of a definite dependence between titers of anti-DNA and anti-MBP Abs and these parameters with standard clinical indices may be due to several reasons. the complex and coordinated action of T- and B-cells, complement system, inflammation mediators, and auto-Abs result in the formation of demyelinization nodi and interruption of axon conductivity. this makes the clinical course of MS hardly predictable in individual patients [38], [44]. epharose, and the superdex 200 HR 10/30 column were from Sigma or GE Healthcare. patients admitted to the Multiple Sclerosis Center of the University of Ferrara were retrospectively selected for the study. disease severity was scored in all MS patients at the time of sample collection using Kurtzke\u2019s Expanded Disability Status Scale. CSF and serum samples were collected under sterile conditions and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C until assay. \"Cell-free\" samples were obtained after centrifugation at room temperature of specimens taken by atraumatic lumbar puncture performed for purposes of diagnosis in the absence of contraindications. assay plates with immobilized double-stranded DNA, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse Abs against human IgG, and tetraethyl benzidine as substrate. the reaction was stopped with sulphuric acid and optical density (A450) of the solutions was determined using a Uniskan II plate reader. Abs were equilibrated with 50 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.6) containing 0.1 M NaCl. the protein was applied to the column (1 ml) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl. the column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl. the activities of IgG preparations were determined as a decrease in the percentage of DNA converted from the initial supercoiled form to the relaxed form. all measurements (initial rates) were taken within the linear regions of the time courses (15\u201340% of DNA hydrolysis) and then recalculated to the standard conditions. incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15\u201348 h in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM CaCl2. the same ethidium bromide-stained or parallel longitudinal slices were used to detect the position of IgG in the gel. ato Etico della Provincia di Ferrara approved our study in accordance with Helsinki ethics committee guidelines. the protocol was approved at 31 May 2007 and focused on the creation of a biological bank of CSF and serum samples. a study of potential markers (especially proteins) for diagnostic and prognostic significance in diseases of the nervous system. titers of anti-DNA Abs were determined using standard assay plates with immobilized double-stranded DNA, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse Abs against human IgG and tetraethyl benzidine as substrate. the reaction was stopped with sulphuric acid and optical density (A450) of the solutions was determined using a Uniskan II plate reader. IgG Purification Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by affinity chromatography of the CSF and serum proteins on protein G-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration similarly to [24]\u2013[27]. in each case the protein corresponding to the central part of IgG peaks was concentrated and used in further purification or analysis. the reaction mixture (20 l) contained 20 g/ml scDNA pBluescript, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.003\u20130.2 mg/ml Abs or initial preparations of the sera or CSF (total protein) finally diluted respectively 1000- and 15-fold. IgG samples were incubated at 22\u00b0C for 10\u201320 min in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% SDS. to restore the enzymatic activity after SDS-PAGE, SDS was removed by incubating the gel for 1 h at 22\u00b0C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) longitudinal slices of the gel were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15\u201348 h in the reaction buffer"}
