{"summary": "ZIKV has a single positive-stranded RNA genome and belongs to the family Flaviviridae. it is genetically and biologically related to other Flaviviridae members. it causes neurological disorders in both fetuses and adults (2\u20136) a high-throughput model was developed for screening anti-ZIKV entrance inhibitors. we screened generic drugs and observed that several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) specifically induced the degradation of the ZIKV entry cofactor AXL and potently inhibited ZIKV infection. the study reveals a new mechanism of action of antiviral agents. both in A549 cells and in Vero but not the entrance of dengue virus (DENV) Env/HIV-1- or VSV G/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. they also potently inhibited the replication of wild-type ZIKV (ZIKV SYSU/2016) in A549 cells at different time points. A549 cells were infected with the wild-type ZIKV SYSU/2016 strain. after 72 h, the cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. the cells were harvested at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. A549 cells were infected with the wild-type MR766 strain. after 48 h, the cell supernatants were harvested for plaque assay. data are representative of those from at least three independent experiments. incubated the compounds with Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses to identify the possible targets of these NSAIDs. however, pretreatment of the target cells with the compounds led to the significant inhibition of virus infection. a significant decrease in the AXL protein level was observed with all NSAIDs tested. a pulse-chase experiment indicated that the NSAIDs promoted the proteolytic shedding of AXL and facilitated its decay. both the viral envelope (E) protein and AXL were simultaneously suppressed by NSAIDs in ZIKV-infected A549 cells. NSAIDs did not affect the expression level of transduced MERTK, TIM-1, or TYRO3 in A549 cells. p24-normalized (50 ng) HIV-1 Luc/Zika virus Env-pseudotyped viruses were incubated with 50 M NSAIDs in a 96-well plate at 37\u00b0C for 12 h. the compound-virus mixtures were transferred into a 30-kDa centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and centrifuged (7,000 g) at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. fresh medium was added onto the filter human SNB19 glioma cells and LN229 glioblastoma cells were incubated with the NSAIDs at 50 M. after 48 h, total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent. mRNA expression of AXL was detected by qRT-PCR. the levels of amino acids incorporated into the immunoprecipitated AXL are shown. the relative amount of AXL was calculated and normalized. after 48 h, the cells were harvested for Western blotting with primary antibodies against the AXL and ZIKV E proteins. a549 cells were treated with 50 M ibuprofen or DMSO for 1 h before or 4 h after infection with MR766 (MOI = 1); data were normalized to those obtained for DMSO-treated cells. values represent the mean SD. a cell membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed with the depletion of a number of membrane protein-related E3 ligases or some endocytosis-related factors. the knockdown of CHIP with siRNA inhibited the NSAID-induced degradation of AXL. the interaction of CHIP with AXL was enhanced by NSAID treatment. ubiquitin signals were captured by a Sigma Duolink in situ red starter kit mouse/rabbit. red, ubiquitin (antibody FK2); green, AXL (antibody C89E7); blue, DAPI. pcDNA3.1-CHIP or pcDNA3.1 plasmid was transfected into HEK293T cells. plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein-HA served as a negative control. NSAIDs inhibit AXL expression by decreasing PGE2 synthesis. forskolin effectively counteracted the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on AXL. a specific PKA kinase inhibitor, H89, significantly facilitated AXL degradation. a PKA-specific siRNA also exerted a similar effect. after 48 h, the cells were incubated with an anti-AXL antibody. the cells were treated with or without 10 M forskolin (FSK) or 5 M H89 for 24 h before harvest. after 48 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting. antiphosphorylation Western blot analysis for wild-type CDC37 and CDC37 with the S97 mutation indicated that S97 was the target of PKA. unexpectedly, we found that treatment with the NSAIDs inhibited the interaction between HSP90 and AXL. the phosphorylation of m/z 708.303324 was demonstrated from the MS/MS spectrum of the m/z 708.303324 ion at a retention time (RT) of 34.29 min. FTMS, Fourier transform mass spectrometry; Tol, tolerance. online software was used to predict the PKA phosphorylation site on CDC37 and show a common motif (RXXS) in S97. the extent of phosphorylation was assessed by Western blot analysis. the membrane was then stripped and reprobed using an anti-CDC37 antibody. after 48 h, cells were harvested and cells were treated with or without 50 M ibuprofen. A549 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and/or plasmids. 50 nM siRNA against NC (si-NC) plus 4 g HSP90-FLAG plasmid. the NSAIDs significantly reduced viral replication in HUVECs infected with ZIKV MR766 (rhesus/1947/Uganda) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. the NSAIDs significantly inhibited ZIKV replication in HUVECs. NSAIDs inhibit replication of Zika virus in HUVECs. HUVECs were incubated with the NSAIDs for 48 h. expression of surface AXL was detected by flow cytometry. cells were harvested and lysed to detect PGE2 via ELISA. after 48 h, the cells were harvested for Western blotting with primary antibodies against the wild-type ZIKV MR766 strain. after 24 h, the cells were infected with the wild-type ZIKV MR766 strain. after 48 h, the cells were harvested for Western blotting with primary antibodies against the ZIKV E protein. NSAIDs inhibited the entry of Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses in A549 cells and in Vero cells. they also potently inhibited the replication of wild-type ZIKV (ZIKV SYSU/2016) in A549 cells at different time points. noxicam for inhibition of wild-type ZIKV replication were 3.11 M, 0.77 M, 0.48 M, 1.63 M, and 0.21 M respectively. these concentrations are considerably lower than those detected in human blood plasma (100 to 400 M) after administration of regular doses of NSAIDs (18) these nucleotide sequences included those of 5 ZIKV strains from Guangdong, China. the red dots indicate strain ZIKV SYSU/2016/Guangdong, isolated in our cooperative labs. NSAIDs directly downregulate AXL expression. we first preincubated the compounds with Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. however, pretreatment led to the significant inhibition of virus infection. a biotin-labeled enrichment technique was developed for cell surface proteins. a pulse-chase experiment indicated that the NSAIDs promoted proteolytic shedding of AXL and facilitated its decay. both the viral envelope (E) protein and AXL were simultaneously suppressed by NSAIDs in ZIKV-infected A549 cells. the reduction in the ZIKV RNA level after ibuprofen treatment was apparent either in the entry phase (0 to 4 h after infection) or at the replication phase (4 to 24 h) of the infection cycle. NSAIDs directly downregulate expression of AXL. A549 cells were incubated with NSAIDs at various concentrations. after 48 h, expression of AXL was detected by Western blotting. the relative amount of AXL was calculated at several time points and normalized. cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min. then chased in presence of DMSO, 50 M ibuprofen, 50 M ibuprofen and 10 M MG132. cells were collected for Western blotting with antibodies against the AXL, TIM-1, ZIKV E, and DENV NS1 proteins. cells were treated with 50 M ibuprofen or DMSO for 1 h before or 4 h after infection with MR766 (MOI = 1); data were normalized to those obtained for DMSO-treated cells. the proteasome inhibitors, but not the lysosome inhibitor, significantly reversed the effects of the NSAIDs. to investigate this further, we assessed the ubiquitin conjugation of AXL and observed that the level of ubiquitinated AXL increased with NSAID treatment in the presence of MG132. A549 cells were treated with DMSO, ibuprofen, or ibuprofen plus MG132. after 48 h, cells were detected by a cell membrane ELISA. siRNAs enhanced 20% were chosen for use in the next step. cells were treated with DMSO or ibuprofen and then transfected with siRNA against the negative control (NC) or CHIP (si-CHIP) after 48 h, cell surface AXL expression was detected by flow cytometry. after 48 h, cells were harvested and expression of AXL was detected by Western blotting. -2-specific siRNAs in A549 cells were involved in AXL maintenance. cAMP activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) to further investigate if this signaling pathway is involved in AXL degradation. forskolin effectively counteracted the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on AXL. A549 cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNAs against COX-1 and/or COX-2. after 48 h, cells were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-AXL antibody. after 48 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting. phosphor-MS data revealed a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acid residue serine 97 (S97) of CDC37 in immunoprecipitates prepared from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells. online software predicted that the PKA phosphorylation site was in the S97 region. NSAID-mediated dephosphorylation of CDC37 at S97 inhibits the CDC37-HSP90 interaction. this inhibition leads to an incorrect AXL conformation and facilitates AXL degradation through the HSP90-CHIP-UPS pathway. Bacterially produced GST fusion proteins were incubated with or without 2,500 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA in a kinase buffer at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. the extent of phosphorylation was assessed using the phosphorylation-specific PKA substrate antibody. cells were harvested for co-IP with FLAG beads at 48 h posttransfection. resulting samples were subjected to Western blotting with anti-HSP90 or anti-FLAG antibodies. the NSAIDs significantly reduced viral replication in HUVECs infected with ZIKV MR766 (rhesus/1947/Uganda) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. the NSAIDs significantly reduced viral replication in HUVECs. the NSAIDs inhibited ZIKV replication only when AXL was overexpressed and not when MERTK or TYRO3 was overexpressed. the NSAIDs inhibit the replication of Zika virus in HUVECs by inducing the degradation of the AXL receptor. the cell supernatants were harvested at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. after 48 h, cells were harvested for Western blotting with primary antibodies against the ZIKV E protein. NSAIDs inhibited ZIKV replication by downregulating the viral entry cofactor AXL (36), which belongs to the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) consistent with previous results, our data also indicated that the AXL-KO cells were no longer infected with ZIKV (17, 35, 36). NSAIDs inhibited ZIKV replication mediated by overexpressed AXL but not that mediated by over the knockout of AXL in HUVECs prevented ZIKV infection. this suggests that AXL plays a major role in mediating ZIKV infection. NSAIDs potently inhibit the COX-1/2 enzymatic activity and the production of PGE2. CDC37 is an important cofactor of HSP90 that assists in stabilizing and activating more than half of the human kinome. CDC37 is an important cofactor of HSP90 that assists in stabilizing and activating more than half of the human kinome. a reduction in its level eventually affects the amount of AXL on the PM. NSAID-mediated reduction in phosphorylation at this site may change the interface between CDC37 and HSP90. incorrect interactions between CDC37 and HSP90 certainly reduce their function during multiple ATP hydrolysis events. an HSP90 ATP hydrolysis inhibitor also potently decreases the expression of AXL expression. all mouse experiments were carried out in strict accordance with good animal practice. the ethics committee of animal experimentation of sun Yat-Sen university approved all animal work. the use of human samples from ZIKV-infected patients was also approved. ka virus prM/E and dengue virus prM/E proteins were chemically synthesized by Genewiz (Suzhou, China) an AXL-expressing plasmid was constructed by amplifying the mRNA of AXL by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), followed by insertion into plasmids pcDNA3.1 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag and pcDNA3.1 with a FLAG tag. all the smart pools of siRNA were obtained from the RiboBio Company. the siRNA target sequences are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. two spectrally distinct fluorogenic substrates for HRP or AP were used to simultaneously detect both the target and the normalization proteins in the same well. fluorescence was measured with excitation at a wavelength of 540 nm and emission at a wavelength 600 nm for the F1 substrate (the HRP-specific substrate) the compounds that inhibited the luciferase activity by more than 50% were selected for secondary screening. after 48 h, cells were lysed at 4\u00b0C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Millipore), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 20 min. the substrates were incubated with or without 1 l (2,500 units) of the catalytic subunit of PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase [PKA]; new England BioLabs) in kinase buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter ATP) in a total volume of 25 l at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. the [35S]methionine-cysteine labeling and pulse-chase analysis were followed with minor modifications (31) cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Sigma). unbound radioactive amino acids were washed and incubated with prewarmed complete medium (chase) the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. the resultant peptides were excised, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were replated onto 96-well plates at a concentration of approximately 0 to 2 cells/well. cells from single colonies were selected for further validation by Western blotting and sequencing. the wild-type viruses replicated in the brains of suckling mice extensively. titration of wild-type ZIKV was performed by a plaque assay. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates and used for infection. the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once. all experiments were carried out in strict accordance with good animal practice. the ethics committee of animal experimentation of sun Yat-Sen university approved all animal work. the use of human samples from ZIKV-infected patients was also approved by the Guangzhou Women's Medical Center. the DNA sequences of the zika virus prM/E and dengue virus prM/E proteins were chemically synthesized by Genewiz (Suzhou, China) an AXL-expressing plasmid was constructed by amplifying the mRNA of AXL by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), followed by insertion into plasmids pcDNA3.1 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag.
