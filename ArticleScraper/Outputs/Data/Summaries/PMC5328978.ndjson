{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. more than 67,900 cases of JE are reported annually. approximately 30% are fatal and 50% suffer from permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae. MLKL recruits Ca2+ and Na+ ion channels and form pores at the plasma membrane leading to the rupture of cells. overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-) from activated microglia exposed to DAMPs may induce more cell death. apoptosis and autophagy are involved in the neuronal loss of JE. mLKL mediated necroptosis was activated in JE and deleted mice showed ameliorated progression of JE compared with wild mice. mice were kind gifts from professor Jiahuai Han and Dr. Jianfeng Wu. neuroblast cell line Neuro2a was bought from ATCC and kept in DMEM. mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 h. silver enhancement was performed in the dark with an HQ Silver Kit (Nanoprobes) for 15 min. sections were fixed with 0.5% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with graded ethanol, replaced with propylene oxide, and flat-embedded in Epon 812. the brains were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% PFA for 30 min. the brains were removed and fixed in the 4% PFA for 3 h. the slides were incubated with primary antibodies anti-NeuN, anti-JEV and anti-MLKL. qRT-PCR mice were euthanatized and perfused with PBS at 5 dpi. whole brain of each mouse was harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with the total RNA as template. Western blotting Total protein from the brain of each mouse or Neuro2a cells was extracted with RIPA buffer and quantified using a protein Reagent Assay BCA Kit. blots were visualized using an Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, LI-COR, NE Lincoln, USA) the level of IL-1, CCL-2, IFN-, and TNF- was tested with mouse ELISA Kit (AMEKO, China) 0.05 were considered significant (*P 0.05, **P 0.01, and ***P 0.001) ethics statement All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University. new-born mice toe DNA samples were amplified through agarose gel electrophoresis for the screening of WT, MLKL+/, MLKL/ descendants. mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium (0.1 ml/10 g body weight) mice were perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde. the brains were removed and fixed in the 4% PFA for 3 h. ultrathin sections (70\u201380 nm) were prepared on an LKB Nova Ultratome (Bromma) after being counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the sections were examined under a JEM-1230 electron microscope (JEM, Japan) at 5 dpi, mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium and then perfused with 0.01 M PBS. neuro2a cells were plated in 24-well plates at the density of 6 104 /well overnight. cells were infected with JEV (MOI = 1) after adsorption for 1 h, virus suspension was removed. qRT-PCR experiments were carried out using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa, Japan) each quantitative PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. the mean threshold cycle (Ct) value for each sample was used for data analysis. the blots were incubated with primary antibodies anti-MLKL (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and pMLKL (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) after being blocked with 3% BSA at RT for 60 min, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at RT. necrosis was detected in mice infected with JEV at 5 dpi through PI staining and electron microscopy. at 5 dpi, massive antigen of JEV was detected in JEV infected mouse brains compared with PBS treated mice. neuronal cells undergo necrosis during JE in mice model. most of brain cells showed classical necrotic morphology with clumps of chromatin, swollen mitochondria and plasma membrane disintegration (PBS = 1, JEV = 2). MLKL mediated necroptosis is involved in JE. at 5 dpi, brains were harvested for immunochemistry, immunoelectromicroscopy, westeron blot and qRT-PCR. there was obvious staining of MLKL around the plasma membrane in the brain sections of JEV infected mice. double-immunostaining of MLKL (green) and JEV (red) in neurons. expression of MLKL is upregulated in neurons infected with JEV. neuro2a cells were infected with JEV at MOI = 0.1, 1, 5 respectively. and 24 h later, cells were collected for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. expression of MLKL is upregulated in neurons infected with JEV. the body weight, behavior scores and survival rate were recorded daily from 0 dpi to 23 dpi when the survivals were completely stable. compared with wild mice, MLKL/ mice showed alleviated progression of JE. the death and survival of mice in each group was recorded. the data was shown as Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves. the level of CCL-2, IL-1, IFN-, TNF- in the brain of WT or MLKL/ mice was detected by qRT-PCR (WT-PBS = 2, MLKL/-PBS = 2, WT-JEV = 2, WT-JEV = 9, MLKL/-PBS = 9, *P 0.05, ***P 0.001). neuronal necrosis is also found in autopsy tissues from human fatal cases. in the microstructure of brain cells, many cells showed classical necrotic morphology with clumps of chromatin, swollen mitochondria and plasma membrane disintegration. neuronal cells undergo necrosis during JE in mice model. mLKL mediated necroptosis is involved in JE. the mLKL around the plasma membrane was obvious in the brain sections of JEV infected mice while it was invisible in control mice. mLKL mediated necroptosis is involved in JE. the relative level of mRNA MLKL was normalized with -actin (PBS = 4, JEV = 8) the mRNA MLKL was significantly increased in mouse brains compared with PBS group. double-immunostaining of MLKL (green) and JEV (red) in neurons. expression of MLKL is upregulated in neurons infected with JEV. neuro2a cells were infected with JEV at MOI = 0.1, 1, 5 respectively. and 24 h later, cells were collected for total protein extraction and western-bloting. expression of MLKL is upregulated in neurons infected with JEV. the body weight, behavior scores and survival rate were recorded daily from 0 dpi to 23 dpi when the survivals were completely stable (WT = 12, MLKL/ = 16). the weight of each mouse was measured and recorded at 16: 30\u201317: 00. AMPs released from disintegrated cells trigger and accelerate inflammation. levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum and brain at 5 dpi were tested. decreased level of IL-1, CCL-2, IFN-, and TNF- in mice compared with wild mice. the brain of WT or MLKL/ mice was detected by qRT-PCR (WT-PBS = 2, MLKL/-PBS = 2, WT-JEV = 9, MLKL/-PBS = 9, *P 0.05, ***P 0.001). neuronal death plays fatal roles in the progression of neuroinflammation during JEV infection. necroptosis pathway is mainly focused on TNF/TNFR/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and RIPK1 independently DAI/RIPK3/MLKL signaling. production of TNF- and stimulation of TLRs participated in the initiation of MLKL mediated necroptosis. the viral load between wild and MLKL/ mice showed no significant difference. necroptosis alone was not enough to restrict JEV spread in vivo. JE is characterized with extensive neuroinflammation. the slowing of JE progression in MLKL/ mice could be attributed to the interruption of the vicious cycle of necroptosis-induced inflammation. this may provide new ways to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of encephalitis. the level of mRNA MLKL was higher in mice with severe clinical symptoms in wild mice. the level of mRNA MLKL was higher in mice with severe clinical symptoms. the intensity of PI positively stained cells of each group were analyzed with Image J. the relative viral load in the brain of WT or MLKL/ mice was detected by qRT-PCR at 5 dpi after administration with JEV 5 107 PFU/20g in 200 l PBS intraperitoneally. primary antibodies were diluted with 0.01 M PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for WB, the primary antibodies were diluted with 0.01 M PBS containing 3% BSA."}
