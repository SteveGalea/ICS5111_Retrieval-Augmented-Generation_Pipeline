{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a contagious respiratory pathogen that is contracted via close contact with infected individuals. it is usually highest among individuals in close proximity with one another. the most index case-patients have either resided in or have travelled to areas neighbouring the Arabian Peninsula. the knowledge of people's connectivity network is very crucial in the spread of infectious diseases transmitted via pathogenic droplets such as respiratory infection, MERS, and Ebola. s have been documented in other infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2003 [12] and more recently Ebola in west africa, 2014\u20132015 [13, 14] and MER-CoV in south Korea, 2015 [10]. the focus is on the 1379 MERS cases reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and September 2016. the variables considered in this study were age, gender, patient type (whether the patient is a healthcare worker or nonhealthcare worker), health outcome (dead or alive) as at the last day of follow-up. patients' contact investigation was conducted by hospital officials by tracing patient's history of exposure to other known risk factors such as contact with other laboratory-confirmed MERS cases. an animal contact patient implies a patient with historical contact with animals, while camel contact patients were those who work in a camel market or have history of contact with camels. a patient is said to have comorbidity if he or she has coexisting chronic diseases or medical conditions.

Figures 2(a)\u20132(d) provide an illustration of different network centrality metrics. each patient number represents a node connected by links called edges. the square nodes represent males while the circle nodes represent females. MERS fatality increases with age, 11% of the infection occurred in older males aged 55\u201359 years and more fatal in older men (above 50 years) 85% of fatality in females occurred in women above 50 years. about 47% of those with some kind of medical condition died of the disease compared to only 17% of patients without medical condition. the largest cluster has a wheel-and-spoke configuration in which patient number 1664 is in the centre and linked to 17 other secondary cases. most of the outbreaks occurred in the hospital (indicated by dark line in Figure 4) and that most of the infected patients were nonhealthcare workers with comorbidity.
