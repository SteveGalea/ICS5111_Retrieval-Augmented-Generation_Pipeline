{"summary": "ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans and non-human primates, with exception of Reston virus (RESTV), which is not pathogenic for humans. the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail. RESTV epizootics among cynomolgus macaques emerged in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1996. in all of these epizootics, the cynomolgus macaques originated in a single primate breeding facility in the Philippines. the cynomolgus macaques originated in a single primate breeding facility in the Philippines. antibody responses to RESTV nucleoprotein (NP) have been shown to correlate with surviving cases. antiinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are known to play a major role in pathogenesis of ebolaviruses infections in various species. a high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines was detected in cynomolgus macaques. the presence of RESTV NP antigens was evaluated by antigen-capture ELISA. RESTV NP antigens were detected in the liver in # 2182, 2612, 2615, 2669, 2739, 2921, 2644 and 2728. 2190, 2191, 2195, 2404, 2693, 2696, 2713 and 2194 were positive for anti-NP IgG in IgG ELISA. a total of 19 samples had anti-NP IgG. a total of 19 samples had anti-NP IgG. the sera derived from cynomolgus macaques in the acute viremic phase did not contain any detectable anti-GP1,2 IgG. the sera derived from cynomolgus macaques did not contain any detectable anti-GP1,2 IgG. the specimens with case IDs written in bold were considered in acute phase. we next attempted to detect the neutralization. RESTV pseudotype RESTV GP1,2 was used for the NT assay. twelve serum samples neutralized the VSV-RESTV-GP1,2/GFP infection. the anti-GP1,2 IgG were not detectable in #2721 and #2972 by IgG ELISA, while those samples both had a neutralizing activity. anti-GP1,2 antibody may increase in cynomolgus macaques in the convalescent phase. anti-GP1,2 antibody is rarely detectable in the acute viremic phase of infection. eleven serum samples were subjected to a multiplex cytokine analysis. the concentrations of the five cytokines/chemokines did not differ significantly between the two groups. the concentration of MCP-1, one of the proinflammatory chemokines, was lower in the convalescent than in the non-convalescent sera (Figure 2). the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, MCP-1, was lower in convalescent than in non-convalescent cynomolgus macaques. each dot represents one sample, and dashes represent the median values. the presence of RESTV NP antigens was evaluated by antigen-capture ELISA. seventeen of the 27 serum samples were positive for anti-NP IgG in IgG ELISA. a total of 19 samples had anti-NP IgG. a total of 19 samples had anti-NP IgG. serum samples showing positive reactions in either the GP1,2-specific IgG-ELISA or IFA were considered to be anti-GP1,2 positive (11/27, 41%, Table 1). serum samples showed positive reactions in either the GP1,2-specific IgG-ELISA or IFA. + + Ag + NT + euthanized 2972 - 80 - 80 160 + + Ag + dead 2180 + 1280 + 320 80 - - Ag - NT + dead 2189 + 1280 + 320 320 - - Ag - NT + NR 2191 + 640 + 320 320 - - Ag - NT + NR 2195 + 2560 + 640 320 - - Ag - NT + dead 2693 antigen positive, Ag -: antigen negative, NT+: neutralization antibody positive, NT-: neutralization antibody negative. the specimens with case IDs written in bold were considered in acute phase. we then attempted to detect the neutralization antibody response in the sera of RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. all nine serum samples were negative for anti-GP1,2 and anti-NP antibodies. anti-GP1,2 antibody may therefore increase in cynomolgus macaques in the convalescent phase. anti-GP1,2 antibody is rarely detectable in the acute viremic phase of infection. concentrations of several proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were significantly higher in convalescent than in acute phase sera. this observation is similar to previous studies showing elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in convalescent or asymptomatic human cases. broken lines and numbers written aside indicate the average concentrations of cytokine and chemokine in negative control cynomolgus macaques. the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, MCP-1, was lower in convalescent than in non-convalescent cynomolgus macaques. RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques were infected with RESTV. soluble GP (sGP), which does not contain membrane anchor, is secreted during ebolaviruses infection. apoptosis of lymphocytes is induced during RESTV infection and host immune responses may thus be abrogated. all but one (serum #2194) of the anti-GP1,2-positive serum samples were Ag negative. cynomolgus macaques were considered to be in the convalescent phase of RESTV infection. cynomolgus macaques in the RESTV epizootic showed higher IL-1ra responses in the convalescent phase than in the non-convalescent phase. the anti-GP1,2 response in cynomolgus macaques was specifically detected in the convalescent stage of RESTV infection. a high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines was observed in the convalescent phase. cynomolgus macaque serum samples were collected from the cynomolgus macaque facility in the Philippines where the 1996 RESTV epizootic occurred. nineteen of the 27 samples were previously subject to an antigen capture ELISA. recombinant RESTV GP1,2 ectodomain expresses RESTV GP1,2. cells were collected, washed with PBS, then lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P40 (NP-40) on ice for 15 min. recombinant RESTV GP1,2TM was purified with Ni2+-agarose beads. the cynomolgus macaque sera were diluted at 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400 in SKIM-PBS-T. the hyperimmune rabbit sera were four-fold serially diluted from 1:1,000 to 1:64,000 in SKIM-PBS-T. one hundred microliters of each serum dilution was added to the antigen-coated wells and incubated for 1 hr at 37 the sum of the OD values of serum dilutions at 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, and 1:6,400 for each specimen was calculated. the mean plus three standard deviations (SD) of the ELISA indices for the IgG-ELISAs was calculated using serum samples from uninfected TPRC cynomolgus macaques. the slides were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. the serum specimens were serially diluted in PBS. a 20 l aliquot of each dilution was applied to the wells of the antigen slides. the slides were washed with PBS and covered with micro cover glasses. the cells were transfected with pKS336-RESTV-GP1,2 using FuGENE HD. the cells were then cultured for 24 hr and inoculated with VSV G*/GFP pseudotyped with the VSV-G protein at a moi of 5, adsorbed for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. the supernatants were stored at -80\u00b0C as VSV-RESTV-GP1,2/GFP. cynomolgus macaque serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. serum dilutions with 50% neutralization (NT50) were identified. serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min, diluted 1:10. two rabbits were immunized four times with the histidine-tagged ectodomain of the RESTV glycoprotein (GP1,2) (RESTV GP1,2TM) the sera were collected from the rabbits, inactivated, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. the experiments were performed in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of the national institute of infectious diseases. the purified recombinant RESTV GP1,2TM was used for the IgG-ELISA specific for RESTV GP1,2. ninety-six well plates were coated with the RESTV GP1,2TM or with negative control antigen in 100 l of PBS. the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then 200 l of PBS-T containing 5% ski adjusted OD values were calculated by subtracting the OD value of the wells coated with the negative control antigen from that of the wells coated with RESTV GP1,2TM. RESTV NP-specific IgG-ELISA is similar to the GP1,2-specific ELISA except for the purified recombinant RESTV NP with a histidine tag at the C-terminus. the cells expressing RESTV GP1,2 were selected in a medium containing 2 g/ml of blasticidin-S-hydrochloride. the cells were triedpsinized, washed with PBS, and mixed with normal HeLa cells. they were then spotted on 14 well Teflon-coated glass slides, air dried, and fixed with acetone at room temperature for 5 min. the antibody titer in the IFA was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing positive staining. the antibody titer in the IFA was determined by counting the number of GFP-positive cells under a fluorescent microscope upon infection into Vero E6 cells. serum samples were serially diluted in DMEM-5% FCS. a 50 l aliquot of each dilution was mixed with the same volume of DMEM-5% FCS containing 1,000 IU of VSV-RESTV-GP1,2/GFP. the mixture was inoculated into vero E6 cells and incubated for 24 hr. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions ST, TI, SF, and SM designed the experiments and analyzed the experimental data. promotion of science KAKENHI."}
