{"summary": "a healthy immune system can act as a tumor suppressor, but in other cases it might facilitate tumor progression. some viral cancers such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B viruses have been effectively prevented through such techniques. a large sample of patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell cervical cancers8 determined 15 HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82) as high risk, three (26, 53, and 66) as probable high risk, and several others (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81) as low-risk types. antiviral vaccines have been developed against the most common of the HPV types that cause these cancers. the vaccines leave out a coverage of 20%\u201330% of the HPV-associated cancer-causing types. the vaccines leave out a coverage of 20%\u201330% of the HPV-associated cancer-causing types. the HPV vaccines belong to the class of recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. they are self-assembling bionanoparticles that mimic the structure of the original virus particle. they do not carry any genetic material, thus providing a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. the first VLP vaccine license was granted in 1986 for the hepatitis B virus. peptide vaccines may be such an alternative strategy to HPV VLP vaccines. the idea is to scan the viral genome for the protein antigens that can elicit immune response. a more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response. we have downloaded 222 sequences of the L1 capsid gene of various HPV types from GenBank, updated till March 22, 2016. we postpone consideration of the other capsid assembly component, the L2 protein, to a future work. a sequence is represented by a point for each nucleotide in succession plotted in a series of steps with one step in the negative x-direction for an adenine, positive y-direction for a cytosine, and in the positive x-direction for a guanine. for a quantitative measure, we take the weighted center of mass (x, y) of the points and the distance of the centre of mass (c.m. a phylogenetic tree of the protein sequences of the primary HPV types brings out this feature explicitly (Fig. 1). to determine the target peptides that can be considered to elicit immune response, the steps in the process are: Global view of L1 gene sequences to determine similar and dissimilar sequences. peptide graph radius, pR, is computed and stored until the end of the aa sequence is reached. each pR value represents a specific peptide sequence. the number of values of the pR at each aa position map out a protein variety profile of the aas covered by the sliding window. peptide variability profile and solvent accessibility profile mapped out to reveal the most solvent accessible regions by the maxima of the graph. first cut peptide segments Mapping both graphs, together, we scan for those regions where the protein variability is least and solvent accessibility is among the highest. each peptide segment is subjected to a protein\u2013protein BLAST to ensure that the selected peptides are not homologous to human proteins to cause autoimmune threats. each peptide segment is subject to a protein\u2013protein BLAST to ensure that the selected peptides are not homologous to human proteins to cause autoimmune threats. the method of analysis has been described in detail in previous papers. the method of analysis has been described in detail in the study by Ghosh et al. plot is in abstract space, but we can again define a weighted center of mass and a protein graph radius, pR, just as for gR. this property has been used in several instances previously19,20,26 and is used in the current work to determine protein sequence segment varieties by determining the number of instances where the pR\u2019s are identical. our interest is to identify those peptide segments that change the least between strains to reduce the possibility of such instances. the method is to map the protein sequence using a window of 12\u201314 aas and sliding in increments of one aa at a time. at each stage, the peptide graph radius, pR, is computed and stored. peptide lengths of 6\u201320 aas are used in scanning for B-cell epitopes. cytotoxic T-cell epitopes have a limited length (8\u201311 residues), while helper T-cell epitopes have a limited length (8\u201311 residues), while helper T-cell epitopes have a limited length. if composite structures of this protein are available, then we can further fine-tune the selection process to identify those segments that lie on an exposed surface of the capsid protein. if composite structures of this protein with the other proteins are available, then we can further fine-tune the selection process to identify those segments that lie on the surface. a phylogenetic tree of the protein sequences of the primary HPV types brings out this feature explicitly (Fig. 1). peptide segments change the least between strains to reduce the possibility of such instances. our interest is to identify those peptide segments that change the least between strains to reduce the possibility. each pR value represents a specific peptide sequence. the number of values of the pR at each aa position map out a protein variety profile of the aas covered by the sliding window. the minima of the profile indicate regions where variety, and by inference changes in aas, are relatively least. first cut peptide segments Mapping both the graphs, namely, peptide variability profile and solvent accessibility profile, together, we scan for those regions where the protein variability is least. we examine the identified regions in a protein 3D structure, eg, as shown through a software such as Cn3D4.3 available at NIH website. each peptide segment is subjected to a protein\u2013protein BLAST to ensure that the selected peptides are not homologous to human proteins to cause autoimmune threats. these segments then become our recommendations for peptide vaccines subject to final verification in wet laboratories. the phylogenetic tree shows explicitly that the strains of each type belong to individual groups. the different types form separate clades: the HPV18 and 45 belong to one clade and the HPV16, 33, and 35 to another. the 2D graphs show at a glance the close similarities between HPV16, 33, and 35. the regions where the lowest variety numbers match with the highest values of the ASA profiles represent potentially the best situated highly conserved surface accessible peptide segments in the protein sequence. the regions so identified are marked by short horizontal lines for further analysis. these are listed regionwise to show peptide segment similarities. the segments marked in red are covered by neighbor. proteins/sequence overlaps could not be ascertained, but can be expected to be similar to those for HPV35. a surface accessible antigen in one protein may get covered by the folds of a neighboring protein. step three of our search for vaccine target regions is to verify surface accessibility of the identified regions. regions 5 listed in the table could not be tested in a similar manner due to the nonavailability of these stretches in the protein crystals. conserved surface-exposed segments identified by comparison of protein variability and ASA profile analysis are highlighted here in yellow using the protein shown in blue as a template. peptide stretches shown are in terms of peptide stretch starting position numbers. the template protein with three of the four peptides highlighted in yellow. the fourth peptide at the back is not visible in this space fill
