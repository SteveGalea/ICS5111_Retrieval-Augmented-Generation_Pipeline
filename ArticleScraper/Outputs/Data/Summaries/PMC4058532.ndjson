{"summary": "a variety of data sources can be exploited for attempting to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics and transmission pathways of a pathogen in a population. rich and diverse data offer unprecedented prospects for understanding the process of disease transmission and ultimately designing adapted containment strategies and prophylaxis. Dedicated methodological approaches are traditionally used to analyze different types of data separately. a community of epidemiologists, modellers, statisticians and bioinformaticians has developed the R package OutbreakTools. this software provides object classes implementing a flexible representation of outbreak data originating from a set of outbreak cases. this software is initiated during a hackathon for the analysis of disease outbreaks in R. a new formal (S4) class \u2018obkData\u2019 has been developed. this class uses different slots to store individual meta data (e.g. age, sex), time-stamped observations made on the individuals (e.g. fever, swab results, or answers on food exposures from questionnaires) complex data structures such as dynamic contact networks or DNA sequences from different genes are respectively stored using the new classes \u2018obkContacts\u2019 and \u2018obkSequences\u2019 okbData objects can be created from standard input files via procedures already available in R. data tables can be imported from text files (extensions \u2018.txt\u2019 and \u2018.csv\u2019) accessing information stored in obkData objects is facilitated by a large number of accessors. these functions allow for the retrieval of specific data (get.data), including sampling dates (get.dates), contacts (get.contacts), individual meta-data (get.individuals) or DNA sequences from given genes (get.dna) this figure represents the temporal distribution of the VIRAL shedding samples gathered during the outbreak. each horizontal line represents an individual. individuals are sorted and coloured by yard. Repeated samples gathered on the same individual are represented using different symbols. outbreakTools includes a simulation tool (function simuEpi) which allows for the generation of outbreaks under a standard SIR model. this outbreak was simulated under a SIR model with 100 hosts, contact rate = 0.005 and recovery rate = 0.1. outbreakTools will be able to evolve and adapt to incorporate new types of data and approaches used for outbreak analysis in R. the new availability of basic tools for outbreak analysis will hopefully encourage the further development of tools for investigating epidemics. OutbreakTools 0.1\u20130 is distributed on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) available for R 3.0.2 on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux platforms. it can be installed as any other package using the graphical user interface."}
