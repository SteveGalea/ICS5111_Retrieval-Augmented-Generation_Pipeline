{"summary": "the cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) was suspected to be dengue. by the end of October, only one of 39 samples was positive for dengue. each of the other islands in the state has at least one dispensary; some have up to four. each dispensary is run by a health assistant to monitor their activities and detect any unusual disease occurrences. on 3 October in Onoun, an island several hundred kilometres north-western of Chuuk Lagoon, a two-year-old boy suddenly developed a rash on his abdomen that moved up to the neck area within minutes. the child started to bleed from the corner of his eyes and his nose and died soon after. by 22 October, 137 cases of suspected dengue were reported with 39 blood samples sent to Brisbane for PCR confirmation. however, only the initial sample was positive for dengue. attacks rates were calculated using the Chuuk State estimated population for 2012.2 There were 18 cases (17 from Onoun and one from Chuuk Lagoon) that had no gender status indicated in their records. 19 cases with no age indicated (17 from Onoun and two from Chuuk Lagoon); these were assigned the same age distribution as the 149 cases for which age was known. information on clinical symptoms was extracted from the medical records for 55 (33%) of the 168 suspected cases. reasons for not being able to extract clinical symptoms were a poor patient history or illegible clinician handwriting. 62% were less than 20 years of age and 60% were male (61% in Chuuk Lagoon, 53% in Onoun and 62% in Satawan) the highest attack rate was in the age group 0\u20134, followed by 60\u201364 and 15\u201319. the age group with the highest number of cases was 0\u20134, followed by 15\u201319, 5\u20139 and 20\u201324. 128 (76%) were from Chuuk Lagoon, 32 (19%) were from Onoun, and eight (5%) from Satawan. onoun had a substantially higher attack rate of suspected cases, given its relatively small population. acute fever (100%), cough (82%), headache (67%) and runny nose (44%) the most commonly reported symptoms were acute fever (100%), cough (82%), headache (67%) and runny nose (44%). the average symptomatic presentation in the 55 cases was not typical for dengue3. fever and headache were common, but there were very few cases with joint pain, eye pain, rash, nausea or vomiting. cough, which was present in 82% of the sample, is not a typical symptom of dengue. 53% Not reported Not reported Eye pain 2% 63% Not reported Not reported Signs of haemorrhage 2% 24% Not reported Not reported Not reported * Feverishness Nasal congestion Body pain Typical symptoms for people having influenza are fever (90\u2013100%), cough (82\u201393%), runny nose (39\u201391%), muscle pain (18\u201394%), and headache (17\u201391%). age group AFI cases Population 2012* Cases/1000 population Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female 168 100 68 52 574 26 338 26 236 3.2 3.8 2.6 0\u20134 57 36 21 6388 3270 3118 8.9 11.0 6.7 5\u20139 17 8 9 6267 3200 3067 2.7 2.5 2.9 10\u201314 5 5 0 5929 3003 2926 0.8 1.7 0.0 15\u201319 25 16 9 5402 2709 2693 in the outer island of Onoun, the first suspected case fell ill in late September. the weekly number of cases peaked on 14 October and 4 November. in total, there were 195 symptoms reported in the records from these 55 cases. 168 128 32 8 Cases with symptom data 55 20 30 5 Acute fever 96% 90% 100% 100% Cough 82% 65% 90% 100% Headache 67% 20% 93% 100% Runny nose 44% 15% 70% 0% Joint pain 13% 15% 7% 40% Nausea 11% 10% 7% 40% Vomiting 7% 10% 10% 0% 0% Muscle pain 5% 5% 7% 0% Diarrhoea 4% 10% 10% 0% Weakness 4% 5% 3% 0% in 82% of the sample, is not a typical symptom of dengue. the clinical presentation in the 55 cases was suggestive of a disease dominated by upper respiratory tract symptoms. the only exception was muscle pain, which was not reported. the influenza season in Chuuk is reported by programme staff to be August to December. three of the seven samples were positive for influenza A(H3). public health measures for the prevention and control of respiratory diseases were undertaken. despite the outbreak being almost over by the time of the investigation, there were several benefits to undertaking it. despite the outbreak being almost over by the time of the investigation, there were several benefits to undertaking it. there is still substantial work to do to improve the utilization, accuracy and confidence in these systems. this will also assist countries to comply with the international health regulations (2005). this requires countries to have the capacity to detect and notify public health events of international concern including infectious disease outbreaks. clinical diagnosis of AFI can often be difficult and misleading. this can mean that opportunities for preventive measures early on are missed. laboratory systems to collect, ship where required and analyse specimens need to be prompt, well rehearsed and resourced to aid outbreak investigation."}
