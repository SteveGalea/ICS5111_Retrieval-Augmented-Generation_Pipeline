{"summary": "study explored the correlation between sputum p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function. p38 MAPK activity was remarkably correlated with the CXCL8 level and neutrophils infiltration in the airway, and the decline of lung function in the COPD patients. in humans and rodents, there exist 2 major forms of CXCL8-77- and 72-amino acid proteins \u2013 with a minor 69-amino acid protein [8,9], with a minor 69-amino acid protein. the primary function of CXCL8 is the induction of chemotaxis in its target cells, especially neutrophils and lymphocytes [10], which involves G subunit-activated phosphatidylinositol p38 MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182 in the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif of the activation loop by upstream MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6. once activated, p38 MAPKs effectively act on several downstream kinases, such as MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK2/3), and eventually influence the function of some transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and translation 48 patients (29 males and 19 females), with average age 66.18.5 years, were included in this study. patients excluded if they had a history of asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or other confounding diseases. the cleared sputum cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. then 1105 cells were collected for the protein extraction. the cells were homogenized in a lysis buffer. the sequences of primers were commercially designed and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) the sequences included: CXCL8: 5\u2032-ATG ACT TCC AAG CTG GCT -3\u2032; -actin: 5\u2032-GAT GGT GGG TAT GGG TCA GAA GGA-3\u2032; and 5\u2032-GCT CAT TGC CGA TGA TGA CCT-3\u2032. 48 patients (29 males and 19 females), with average age 66.18.5 years, were included in this study. patients excluded if they had a history of asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or other confounding diseases. the cleared sputum cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. then 1105 cells were collected for the protein extraction. the cells were homogenized in a lysis buffer. the sequences of primers were commercially designed and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) the sequences included: CXCL8: 5\u2032-ATG ACT TCC AAG CTG GTG GCT -3\u2032; -actin: 5\u2032-GAT GGT GGG TAT GGG TCA GAA GGA-3\u2032; and 5\u2032-GCT CAT TGC CGA TGA TGA CCT-3\u2032. -p38 MAPK, the active form of the kinase, was examined in the sputum samples and was compared among the control and the patients with COPD in different stages. notably, the level of phosphorylated p38 MAPK significantly increased, paralleling the severity of disease. ELISA analysis revealed an increased sputum CXCL8 protein in the patients with COPD. 8 in sputum samples was positively correlated with the sputum phospho-p38MAPK level in patients with COPD. phospho-p38 MAPK level was correlated with the sputum phospho-p38MAPK level in patients with COPD. increased phospho-p38 MAPK activity was inversely correlated with the FEV1% in patients with COPD. phospho-p38 MAPK activity was significantly increased in the sputum samples of the patients with COPD. increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK in sputum samples of COPD patients. increased sputum CXCL8 expression and its correlation with p38 MAPK level in patients with COPD. phospho-p38 MAPK level was correlated with the sputum CXCL8 mRNA and protein level in the COPD patients. compared to the control group, the number of immune cells and the percentage of neutrophils were significantly increased in the sputum samples from patients with COPD. MAPK in patients with COPD COPD is characterized as the chronic obstruction of airway flow as demonstrated by the significant reduction of FEV1 in clinical patients. phospho-p38MAPK was significantly negatively correlated with the level of phospho-p38MAPK in the sputum sample of patients with COPD. p38 MAPK is the most important in the inflammatory response of COPD in the lungs [17]. p38 MAPK was correlated with the CXCL8 in COPD patients. p38 MAPK activity was correlated with sputum CXCL8 level in COPD patients. p38 MAPK is a critical factor in modulation of the production of proinflammatory factor (e.g. CXCL8) in airway inflammation in COPD. p38 MAPK was correlated with airway inflammation in COPD. significantly decreased levels of p-HSP27 and TNF- in whole blood and sputum neutrophils, indicating a remarkable reduction of airway inflammation [17,42\u201344] in patients with COPD. p38 MAPK was correlated with reduced FEV1% in patients with COPD. p38 MAPK is a critical factor in devastation of lung function. the level of sputum p38 MAPK was remarkably correlated with the severity of disease. it is likely that the isoform of p38 MAPK is the most important in the inflammatory response of COPD in the lungs [17] p38 MAPK activity was correlated with airway inflammation in COPD. sputum level of phospho-p38 MAPK was significantly correlated with the amount of neutrophils. p38 critically participates in the migration of neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils. p38 MAPK and isoform with selective inhibitor SD282 significantly suppressed subchronic tobacco smoke-induced macrophages and neutrophils. transient or long-term administration of the p38 inhibitor SB681323 significantly decreased the levels of p-HSP27 and TNF- in whole blood and sputum neutrophils. p38 MAPK was correlated with the reduced FEV1% in COPD. pathogenesis and treatment of COPD in clinical patients."}
