{"summary": "to create a human MPA, we constructed 2,700 linear synthetic genes encoding for human membrane proteins. the transmembrane domain frequency of these synthetic genes matched the predicted frequency in the human membrane proteome. a microfluidic device was then programmed with this ORF array (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). several possible factors can affect protein expression, including DNA concentration, protein length, and membrane topology. we examined possible bias in protein expression due to spotted DNA concentration (0\u20130.2 M) or protein length (60\u20131,400 aa) a total of 99 interactions were observed (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Dataset S2) for SV40 we used a two-step strategy. the second screen included positive hits from the wide screen, a control set of known positives and a set of negative controls. the protein array library for screening l-HDAg was expressed on-chip by using cell-free TNT. l-HDAg was expressed in-tube by using the same cell-free procedure and microsomal membranes. l-HDAg was then incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies for the different tags on the respective proteins. 63 of the identified interactions are associated with 13 significantly enriched biological processes, including glycoprotein metabolic process, immune response, carbohydrate biosynthetic process, or ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. both SV40 and l-HDAg were shown to interact independently with proteins that are components of the same functional complex. l-HDAg interacts with USE1 and syntaxin 18 (STX18) both components of a complex involved in Golgi to ER retrograde transport that directly interact with each other. l-HDAg interacts with PDGFRA and PDGFRB, which upon ligand binding at the plasma membrane, form a heterodimer. image analysis revealed that SV40 coimmunoprecipitated with 18 of 20 proteins (blue) the interactions of 17 proteins were highly significant, and a mild interaction was observed for one protein. a mild interaction was observed for one protein. luciferase activity of the 21 l-HDAg\u2013protein interactions was measured. the results were expressed as normalized luminescence ratios. the lower success rate of l-HDAg validation compared with SV40 could be attributed to the differences in validation techniques. the transmembrane domain frequency of these synthetic genes matched the predicted frequency in the human membrane proteome (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) (2). the programming (alignment of microarray to the device) was performed manually. 10% of the genes were misaligned and thus could not be expressed. expression due to spotted DNA concentration or protein length (60\u20131,400 aa) no correlation between protein expression and DNA concentration or protein length (60\u20131,400 aa) transmembrane domain topology may affect the efficiency of protein expression. a total of 99 interactions were observed (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Dataset S2). sensitivity and specificity of this system to SV40-membrane protein interaction to be 64% and 71% respectively. pathogen receptor discovery with MPA was an original tool for de novo characterizing viral tropism. l-HDAg was loaded onto the device and subsequent incubation period allowed possible host-l-HDAg interactions to reach equilibrium. the surface-bound protein array and the trapped l-HDAg were then incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies. a total of 150 interactions were observed and further analyzed. l-HDAg interacts with CD20, CD116, CD140b, and BST. 63 of the identified interactions are associated with 13 significantly enriched biological processes. l-HDAg interacts with USE1 and syntaxin 18 (STX18) l-HDAg interacts with PDGFRA and PDGFRB. disconnected proteins (nodes) were excluded. SV40 protein interactions were validated by co-IP. image analysis revealed that SV40 coimmunoprecipitated with 18 of 20 proteins (blue) these results demonstrate high correlation with the MPA screen (90%) the interactions of 17 proteins were highly significant, and a mild interaction was observed for one protein. the lower success rate of l-HDAg validation compared with SV40 could be attributed to the differences in validation techniques. the lower success rate of l-HDAg validation compared with SV40 could be attributed to the differences in validation techniques. a high-fidelity hot start DNA polymerase (Phusion II; FINNZYMES) was used for all PCR procedures. a reaction mix with a total volume of 20 L was prepared by using 0.8 units of DNA polymerase for each reaction. a series of synthetic genes were spotted onto epoxy-coated glass substrates. each sample solution contained 0.125% of polyethylene glycol (PEG; Sigma Aldrich) and d-trehalosedihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL in dH2O. biotinylated PEG (1 g/L; Nanocs) was flowed through the chip for 30 min. the antibody bound to the exposed Neutravidin created an anti-His tag or c-Myc tag array. nonspecific labeling of the fluorescent antibody was determined by using a microarray scanner (LS Reloaded; Tecan) using a 532-nm laser and 575-nm filter. protein interactions were determined with a microarray scanner (LS Reloaded; Tecan) using a microarray scanner (LS Reloaded; Tecan) using. SV40 virions were produced and purified as described (25) next, SV40 virions were labeled by using commercial kits. for MPA screening, 2,686 membrane proteins expressed on-chip as above. for MPA screening, 2,686 membrane proteins expressed on-chip as above. expression was performed in a final volume of 12.5 L, including 1 g of DNA. expressed proteins were then incubated either with anti\u2013c-Myc-Cy3 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) or with Cy5-labeled SV40 virions (15 nM) plasmids or control empty vectors were cotransfected into 293T or Huh-7.5 cells plated in 96-well plates in triplicates. results were expressed as luminescence ratio, which represents the average luminescence signal detected in cells transfected with both Gluc1 and Gluc2. image (cy3 channel) was used to determine bait (on ChIP-expressed protein) expression level. l-HDAg interaction signal was calculated as the average of median signals obtained from the respective quadruplet. a histogram of the l-HDAg interaction signal was plotted and allowed determination of a cutoff at 4 SD above the array control background signal. each quadruplet above that threshold was examined and interactions with false signal that resulted from visible aggregates on the glass slide or inside the microfluidic device were discarded. a reaction mix with a total volume of 20 L was prepared by using 0.8 units of DNA polymerase for each reaction. the PCR assay was performed in a 96-well plate in 25 cycles. the extension time ranged from 45 to 300 s in 72 \u00b0C depending on the ORF length. each sample solution contained 0.125% of polyethylene glycol (PEG; Sigma Aldrich) and d-trehalosedihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL in dH2O. arrays were aligned to the microfluidic device by hand under a stereoscope and bonded for 4 h on a heated plate at 80 \u00b0C. microsomal membranes (Promega) were added to the extract to express membrane proteins (including l-HDAg) the expression of the proteins from the spotted synthetic genes on the device created an array of proteins ready for use in a binding screen. the tube was incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 2.5 h with agitation (600 rpm) each expressed receptor was attached to a specific part of the device. recombinant ligands (CXCL10, CTLA4, ZP3, EGF, CD40L, TNF-, TNF-, and CD48) were applied to the device. interaction levels were determined with a microarray scanner (LS Reloaded; Tecan) using a 633-nm laser and 695-nm filter for Cy5 and normalized to protein expression level. after incubation, buttons were closed and unbound viruses were washed out. single beads\u2019 median intensities were measured for either protein expression or SV40 co-IP. l-HDAg Interaction Validation by PCA. a total of 21 ORFs encoding the human proteins were picked from the Human ORFeome library. image (cy3 channel) was used to determine bait (on ChIP-expressed protein) expression level. rows and columns without DNA array were used to assess nonspecific binding of labeled antibodies to the surface. a signal that was 2 SD above the average noise was considered successful protein expression.
