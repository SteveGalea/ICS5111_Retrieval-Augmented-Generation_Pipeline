{"summary": "china's one-child-per-couple policy introduced in 1979 led to profound demographic changes for nearly a quarter of the world's population. the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, and imbalanced sex ratios. of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. the total birth rate dropped from 2.90, before the policy was introduced, to 1.94 among women over 35 years of age, and to 1.73 among women under 35 years old in 2001. the total fertility rate decreased from 2.9 in 1979 to 1.7 in 2004, with a rate of 1.3 in urban areas and less than 2.0 in rural areas. this trend has created a distinct demographic pattern for nearly a quarter of the world's population. we developed a continuous-time, event-driven, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission in a dynamic population. the strict one-child policy was introduced to compare influenza transmission rates with a hypothetical one-child policy to rates with an actual one-child policy. the existing census data do not reflect the effects of truly restricting families to one child. forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year period (2015 to 2024) in a population with a two-child policy. we used census data [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] to construct a population with demographic changes. a simple dynamic network structure was used to group people with household links, school links and social links.

Model Structure Natural history of influenza Individuals infected with the influenza virus first pass through a latent period when they are asymptomatic and not infectious. each individual in the model is in one state of (susceptible), (mild exposure), (not mild exposure), (mild asymptomatic infectiousness), (symptomatic infectiousness) and (recovered with immunity) the population's inflow and outflow are represented by each individual's age-specific death rate d and age-specific fertility rate b. we let denote the total duration of an epidemic season (for example, 365 days in this model) and (an offset from time 0) is the peak time of an epidemic season. the probability of infection for each individual depends on the immunity level, seasonality, and the contact rates. a proposed two-child policy allows one female to have two children. it was implemented by increasing the fertility rate for nulliparous females. to calibrate the population, we fit the age-specific population number of each year and the average household size of each year to the census data. individual b has two household members (c and d), two visible casual contacts (a and e), and three visible schoolmates (f, i and j), other social contacts and schoolmates of b are not shown in this small part of contact network. if b was an index case, the household contacts would be at highest risk of being infected due to the higher contact rates among household members than the casual and school contacts. each individual whose age is between the primary-school-age of 6 and 12 years or between the middle-school-age of 13 and 18 years has school links that are initialized using the primary and middle schools' statistical data of Gansu province in china in 1975. each individual may have several random random contacts per day with a daily contact rate contactcasual = 16. transmission between the infectious individual and his/her household members during the infectious period is randomly chosen from the entire population. the dynamic immunity level of an individual depends on his/her infection history, the immunity waning rate per year and the current time. five exogenous infectious cases with the same influenza strain are introduced into the population on November 15th in 1975 to start influenza transmissions via the contact networks of all individuals. the first four-year influenza seasons from 1975 to 1979 are used to enable the totally susceptible population in 1975 to have partial immunity in 1979. a strict one-child policy includes the assumption that there is no chance for a female who already has a child to give birth to a second child. parameters (1), (2), (3) and (4) are age-dependent parameters with 5 age categories: 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 25, 26 to 49, and 50+ years. simulations yielding average annual attack rate (AR) within the range (0.1, 0.2)[28], [29], [30], [31], and secondary attack rate (SAR) inside the range (0.09,0.32)[7], [32], [33], [61], [62], [63], were considered plausible. the individual-based model was implemented and programmed in C++ [65] and R [66] following our previously published agent-based transmission models. we used an agent-based platform ABM++ [69] which supports parallel and cluster computing. the running time for a single run of the model varied with input parameters in Tables 1 and 2. in this model, we classified influenza as mild or not being mild. individuals in each severity type progress to different stages. a recovered individual loses immunity with rate, reverting to the uninfected susceptible stage. the transmission of seasonal influenza tends to increase substantially from November to February in the northern hemisphere and from May to August in the southern hemisphere [57]. to incorporate seasonality of influenza transmission into our model, we modeled the transmission probability per contact as a sinusoidal function of time according to, so that the transmission probability, Ptrans, varies during the course of the epidemic. population projections without the control of a one-child policy were implemented by assuming a static age-specific fertility rate (from 1975) and fixing the birth rate to the same value that it was in 1975. we also analyzed the assumption of a very strict one-child policy that allows one female to have only one child in her life. this small part of the network has 13 individuals in 5 households with different sizes. individual a is in a 1-member household, individuals l and m are in a 2-member household, individuals b, c and d are in a 2-member household, individuals e, f, g and h are in a 4-member household. individual b has two household members (c and d), two visible casual contacts (a and e), and three visible schoolmates (f, i the dynamic age-dependent mortality rate and the dynamic age-dependent fertility rate are from the population data of china from 1975 to 2009. the partnership searching rate per year is calibrated to fit to the observed household size from 1975 to 2009. the dynamic age-dependent fertility rates under the other three scenarios are assumed to be zero if the individual already has more than one child for the strict-one-child-policy. the contact times between the infectious individual and his/her casual contacts during his/her infectious period are randomly chosen from the individual's school links. the transmission between the infectious individual and the susceptible casual contacts will be active at the scheduled times. the transmission between the infectious individual and the susceptible casual contacts will be active at the scheduled times. individuals are assumed to become symptomatic and infectious with an average duration of 1.5 to 3.8 days [43], [44], [45], [51], [52]. in this model, we classified influenza as being mild or not being mild. the non-mild cases may be symptomatic and infectious as well () the transmission of seasonal influenza tends to increase substantially from November to February in the northern hemisphere and from May to August in the southern hemisphere [57]. to incorporate seasonality of influenza transmission into our model, we modeled the transmission probability per contact as a sinusoidal function of time. population projections without the control of a one-child policy were implemented by assuming a static age-specific fertility rate (from 1975) and fixing the birth rate to the same value that it was in 1975. we also analyzed the assumption of a very strict one-child policy that allows one female to have only one child in her life. the population contact network of this model consists of every individual's household, school (if in school age) and casual links. individual a is in a 1-member household, individuals l and m are in a 2-member household, individuals b, c and d are in a 2-member household, individuals e, f, g and h are in a 4-member household. each individual has some casual links (linked by thin lines) to other non-household members. the dynamic age-dependent mortality rate and the dynamic age-dependent fertility rate are from the population data of china from 1975 to 2009. the partnership searching rate per year is calibrated to fit to the observed household size from 1975 to 2009. the dynamic age-dependent fertility rates under the other three scenarios are assumed to be zero if the individual already has more than one child for the strict-one-child-policy. the contacts between the infectious individual and his/her casual contacts during his/her infectious period are randomly chosen from the entire population. the transmission between the infectious individual and the susceptible casual contacts will be active at the scheduled times. the transmission between the infectious individual and the susceptible casual contacts will be active at the scheduled times. first influenza season in 1975 is used to calibrate influenza natural history parameters and transmission parameters by choosing their values leading to an approximate R 0 around 1.5. the first four-year influenza seasons from 1975 to 1979 are used to enable the totally susceptible population in 1975 to have partial immunity in 1979. the average household size corresponded to census data in 1964, 1982, 1990 and 2000. we calibrated the model using eight influenza transmission parameters. the annual attack rate (averaged over 30 years) and the simulated household secondary attack rate (SAR) inside the range (0.09,0.32) were considered plausible. simulations were run for 4000 sets of parameters, resulting in 646 parameter sets that fit the acceptable AR and SAR ranges stated above. parameter sets having higher or lower values of AR or SAR were excluded. under each scenario, we used 646 fitted sets of parameters (described in the Calibration section) to simulate influenza transmission. each scenario was simulated 100 times and the annual and secondary attack rates were averaged among 100 simulated ARs and SARs. the distribution of the difference of annual attack rates with a mean of 6.08% per year using 646 fitted sets of parameters is positive for all sets of parameters. each value of AR is the difference of the average annual attack rates over 30 years between two different policies. this supports the notion that the one-child policy gradually reduced the annual attack rate. for each parameter set, we simulated the influenza trajectories under two demographic control policies. for each parameter set, we simulated the influenza trajectories under two demographic control policies. we then computed the difference in average secondary attack rates over 30 years between two policies. change in household structure and proportion of children in the population could have more effects on the AR. but the difference in AR could be as high as 60% under a scenario of very high immunity loss rate per year. population without a one-child policy has slightly higher annual attack rates. we predicted influenza transmission over 10 years (2015 to 2024) in a population with a hypothetical two-child policy. we did not find significant differences in the secondary attack rates. the average annual attack rate is slightly lower in a population with a one-child policy. this may result from a decreased household size (from 4.2 in 1979 to 3.5 in 2004 in the model) but there is no discernible difference in the SAR. the decrease of average household size (from 4.2 to 3.5) might not be large and fast enough to obviously reflect the change in the secondary attack rate. Figure S2 Progression of the model. each individual in the model is in one state of (susceptible), (mild exposure), (not mild exposure), (mild asymptomatic infectiousness), and the population's inflow and outflow are represented by each individual's age-specific death rate d and age-specific fertility rate b. the blue, green and red lines are simulated average household sizes of each year under three scenarios: one-child policy, strict one-child policy, and absence of one-child policy. the simulated average household size decreased from 4.2 in 1979 to about 3.5 in 2009."}
