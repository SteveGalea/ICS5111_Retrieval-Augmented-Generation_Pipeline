{"summary": "nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with and without pneumonia were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. the association of viral load with case status was evaluated using logistic regression. the mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. a control participant was considered to have a respiratory tract illness (RTI) if cough or runny nose was reported. a control participant was considered to have a respiratory tract illness (RTI) if cough or runny nose was reported. the 18 viruses or virus classes included influenza A, B, and C viruses; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A and B (A and B not differentiated); rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B (A and B not differentiated); adenovirus; enterovirus and parechovirus multivariable logistic regression was performed to compare odds of being a case for each 3.4-unit drop in Ct value. Ct values instead of viral density were used for regression because viral density was only accurate within the linear range of the assay. a control participant was considered to have a respiratory tract illness (RTI) if cough or runny nose was reported. a control participant was considered to have a respiratory tract illness (RTI) if cough or runny nose was reported. the 18 viruses or virus classes included influenza A, B, and C viruses; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A and B (A and B not differentiated); rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B (A and B not differentiated); adenovirus; enterovirus and parechovirus multivariable logistic regression was performed to compare odds of being a case for each 3.4-unit drop in Ct value.

PAF not shown where adjusted OR was 1 resulting in negative PAF. there were no significant differences in the viral load between cases who were normally nourished vs malnourished. influenza C was the only virus with higher mean viral load for very severe pneumonia compared to severe pneumonia. influenza C was the only virus with higher mean viral load for very severe pneumonia compared to severe pneumonia (Supplementary Figure 3). a 13% increased odds for HBOV to a 102% increased odds for RSV. despite differences in viral load between cases and controls, there was substantial overlap in the viral density distribution between cases and controls in which virus was detected. kernel density distribution plots were examined for a bimodal distribution with a smaller subset of cases having viruses at a higher viral load. the NP/OP viral load for the 2 cases with viruses detected in PCR of lung aspirates fell within the distribution of viral loads for other cases, as well as controls, positive for that virus. no virus had an AUC >0.8 (Table 3), with only 3 other viruses having an AUC between 0.6 and 0.7 (influenza A, PIV1, and PIV3) the odds ratio for predicting case status increased substantially for some viruses, approximately doubling for adenovirus, coronavirus 63, PIV2, and RSV.
