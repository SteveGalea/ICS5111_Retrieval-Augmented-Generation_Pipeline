{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs) with genetic and antigenic proximities to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are not considered separate species but as belonging to the species Betacoronavirus-1 within the genus Betacoronavirus. this family is separated into two subfamilies: Torovirinae and Coronavirinae. some Betacoronaviruses present the hemagglutinin-esterase protein. study was designed to perform multigenic comparison of coronaviruses from adult cattle with winter dysentery, calves with neonatal diarrhea, and horses based on partial sequences of the HE, S, and N genes. nested RT-PCRs, DEPC-treated water was used as a negative control every five samples, also added to the mix. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) cDNA was synthesized using random primers (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) cDNA was synthesized using random primers (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) positions with scores >20 were used to assemble sequences with CAP-Contig in BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [15]. positions with scores >20 were used to assemble sequences with CAP-Contig. sequences were then aligned with BCoV and EqCoV homologous sequences. 058942, AY5852229, AF251144, NC010327, EF446615, AF058943, GU808349, GU808341, GU808345, GU808344, EF424619, EF424618, EF424618, EF424618, EF424615, EF424620, GU808350, AF391541, and AF058944. field samples Fecal samples were collected from eight dysenteric and three healthy adult cows in 2010 from a farm in Parana State, southern Brazil. two samples came from healthy young adult horses (E17 and E19) in 2009 in a farm in So Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil. three fecal samples from dairy calves with neonatal diarrhea collected in the state of MG, Southeastern Brazil, in 2001. sequences were resolved in an ABI-377 sequencer. positions with scores >20 were used to assemble sequences with CAP-Contig. sequences were aligned with BCoV and EqCoV homologous sequences. AY316300, NC010327, and EF446615. distance phylogenetic trees were calculated using CLUSTAL/W with BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [15] and the BLOSSUM62 matrix. canine coronavirus (CCoV, Alphacoronavirus) S and N genes were used as outgroups. MHV was not used as outgroups for S and N in order to have an outgroup that diverged from the ingroup (Betacoronavirus) before the internal speciation of this group. results The tree based on HE nt. sequences showed that both equine strains which segregated with BCoV strains from this study are the lowest identity percentage was 71.65% for aa and the highest was 72.85% for nt. equine strains E17 and E19 segregated amongst BCoV strains from calves of Southeastern region of Brazil, identified as USP and again diverged from EqCoV strains. the lowest and highest identities were 47.2% (nt.) and 56.8% (aa) the identity amongst groups of BCoV strains studied herein and other BCoV strains ranged from 89.20 to 98.17% and 86.45 to 97.89% for nt. and aa, respectively. the lowest and highest percentage identities were 92% (nt.) and 95.10% (aa) the E17 strain showed a G274C nucleotide substitution, resulting in a Val92Leu change. the lowest and highest percentage identities were 92% (nt.) and 95.10% (aa) coronavirus strains E17 and E19, detected in horses, did not cluster with EqCoV strains already described [7, 9]. the presence of coronaviruses similar to BCoV in hosts other than cattle has already been reported in buffalos [17, 18], lamas and alpacas [19, 20], deer [21], and giraffes [22]. a similar pattern of segregation for HE was maintained for S. strain E17 has diverged from E19 and BCoV strains, owing to a single nucleotide substitution, leading to aa substitution Val92Leu. the new taxonomy for the Nidovirales represents a great advance in organizing the increasing number of coronavirus \u201cspecies\u201d constantly being discovered. the genealogy of enteric BCoVs from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographical patterns, when the S and HE genes are taken into account."}
