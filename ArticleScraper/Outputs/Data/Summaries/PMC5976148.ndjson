{"summary": "infectious diseases are a major concern for wildlife conservation. examples include amphibian chytridiomycosis, threatening several species with extinction at local and global scales. canine distemper virus epidemics, killing 23,000 north sea harbour seals in 1988 and 30,000 in 2002. lowered adult survival and very low breeding success have both contributed to the population decline until the mid-1990s. however, the subsequent decline was primarily caused by a low fledging success. avian cholera is an infectious disease of major economic impact. despite the critical situation of seabirds, no demographic trend has ever been published for the sooty albatross and the northern rockhopper penguin. despite the critical situation of seabirds, no demographic trend has ever been published for the sooty albatross and the northern rockhopper penguin. five large (over 1,000 g) seabird species breed annually or biennially on Amsterdam Island. three introduced mammal species remain on the island, namely feral cats Felis catus, brown rats Rattus norvegicus and house mice Mus musculus. the annual breeding population growth rate was defined as r = ln (), where = Nt/Nt-1, and Nt and Nt-1 are the abundance of breeding pairs in year t and t-1 respectively. swabs were obtained with sterile rayon-tipped applicators (Puritan, Guilford, ME, USA) the carcasses were immediately frozen and stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis (for up to one year). cDNA were obtained following a previously published protocol [26,27]. the ABsolute Blue qPCR low ROX Mix was used for real-time PCR detection (Coronavirus, Paramyxovirus and Influenza A virus) the ABsolute Blue qPCR SYBR low ROX Mix was used for real-time PCR detection (Flavivirus), and GoTaq Hot Start Green Master Mix 2X for end-point (P. multocida, E. rhusiopathiae, Rickettsia all bacterial morphospecies were visually differentiated and tested by PCR for P. multocida [28] and E. rhusiopathiae [29] on each plate, all bacterial morphospecies were visually differentiated and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr. a minimum-spanning tree was built using goeBURST Full MST algorithm (PHYLOViZ 1.1, 2014), by concatenating all seven MLST genes found in various hosts worldwide. the animal procedures used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Comit\u00e9 de l\u2019Environnement Polaire and by the French Ministry of Research. more than 20,000 pairs of yellow-nosed albatross breed with 400 pairs of sooty albatross and 12,000 pairs of northern rockhopper penguin. the very small population (40\u201350 pairs) of the biennially breeding Amsterdam albatross is found on the Plateau des Tourbi\u00e8res. sampled chicks were between one and eight months old and adults were all breeders. blood and cloacal swabs were immediately placed in 0.5 ml of RNA NOWTM. blood samples were kept in 2 ml tubes for up to four hours. the obtained cDNA (40 l) were diluted 1:2 and stored at -20\u00b0C until tested. cDNA were eluted in a final volume of 60 l. PCRs were carried out in a BIO-RAD CFX96 TouchTM thermocycler. amplification products were analysed by electrophoresis on agarose gels stained with 2% GelRedTM. each bird, 100 l of each organ homogenate was streaked onto a blood agar plate. ih.gov/Blast.cgi using GenBank BLASTN 2.2.29+. 18 randomly selected bacterial colonies were further tested for P. multocida by PCR [28] to validate our visual identification. the monitored breeding population of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses has been dramatically declining at an annual rate of -0.0569. a comparable decrease (annual rate: -0.0777) was recorded for breeding northern rockhopper penguins, resulting in a 81.9% decrease during 1994\u20132016. Molecular detection of infectious agents in live birds Coronavirus, Paramyxovirus and Influenza A virus were not detected in cloacal and oro-pharyngeal swabs. all samples (i.e. blood and swabs) were also screened for P. multocida and E. rhusiopathiae DNA. values are percentages of positive samples (95% confidence intervals) Species Age Number of samples collected Pasteurella multocida Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae CS OS RBC CS OS RBC CS OS RBC Amsterdam albatross Chicks 21 21 21 0 4.8 (0\u201313.9) 0 0 4.8 (0\u201313.9) 0 Indian yellow-nosed albatross Chicks 12 12 12 33.3 ( tissues from three chick carcasses yield positive P. multocida cultures. tissues from other sooty albatross chick and the Amsterdam albatross chick were both negative through culture. a single morphospecies was recorded on Petri dishes plated with heart. in 2012\u20132013, P. multocida was isolated from tissues of three of the six carcasses. one brown skua, one sooty albatross, and one Indian yellow-nosed albatross were negative. a single morphospecies was found on Petri dishes with high bacterial load. a single P. multocida allelic profile was found on Amsterdam Island corresponding to sequence type (ST) 61. it belongs to P. multocida group A (P. multocida multocida) the genetic relationships of this ST with other lineages are shown on a minimum-spanning tree. breeding success was high on average for the Amsterdam albatross (mean sd: 0.677 0.160), except for a few years when high chick mortalities were recorded. breeding success for the sooty albatross was low (0.159 0.193), declining during the 1980\u2019s (slope = -0.012 0.003, P 0.001) and eventually remaining very low. sporidia (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon) in red blood cell samples. all samples (i.e. blood and swabs) were also screened for P. multocida and E. rhusiopathiae. none of the samples tested positive for both cloacal and oro-pharyngeal swabs. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 one sooty albatross and two Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses yield positive P. multocida cultures. tissues from the other sooty albatross chick and the Amsterdam albatross chick were both negative through culture. a single morphospecies was recorded on Petri dishes plated with heart (26, 924 and 474 colonies from D2, D3 and D4 carcasses), lung (872, 1,744 colonies from D3 and D4 chick 2011\u20132012 - D6 Sooty albatross Chick 2012\u20132013 - D8 Indian yellow nosed albatross Chick 2012\u20132013 Heart, lung, liver D10 Brown skua Chick 2012\u20132013 - D11 Indian yellow nosed albatross Adult 2012\u20132013 Heart, lung, bone marrow, liver D12 Indian yellow nosed albatross Chick 2012\u20132013 Heart, lung, bone marrow, liver * indicates that other bacterial the genetic relationships of this ST with other lineages are shown on a minimum-spanning tree built using data from 969 isolates available on Pasteurella multocida MLST database. ST61 can be considered as a founder group since this lineage has evolved towards several other STs found in multiple hosts. ty albatrosses and northern rockhopper penguin breed highly interspersed. low nest density is contrary to high nest densities in colonies of northern rockhopper penguin or Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses. it is possible that this low nest density limits spreading of infectious diseases. one live chick tested positive for P. multocida and one other for E. rhusiopathiae. a high prevalence of shedding adult brown skuas was found for P. multocida. acute disease onset is common for avian cholera. in the wild, the disease primarily affects densely aggregating bird species such as waterfowl and seabirds. avian cholera could have become endemic within Amsterdam Island seabirds since the 1980\u2019s. all Amsterdam Island P. multocida isolates corresponded to a single ST previously reported from a duck in Denmark in 1985. the absence of genetic variation within the housekeeping genes included in the MLST scheme precludes more detailed evolutionary analysis. skuas have been observed during that period with skuas occasionally landing in the poultry enclosure searching for food. humans may also have contributed to the spread of these infectious agents throughout the island when commuting and/or conducting research activities into seabird colonies. the absence of bird die-offs in the 1980\u2019s suggests that rats may not be at the origin of the introduction of these infectious agents. the identification of P. multocida as the cause of several epizootics paves the way for further investigations and the subsequent implementation of specific control actions. rats and seabird chicks are both preyed by brown skuas, which may transmit the bacteria from rodents to albatrosses and between albatrosses. sooty albatrosses have suffered an abrupt decline in reproductive success between 1995 and 2005 with total breeding failure since 2011. the situation has also worsened for the northern rockhopper penguin, with zero fledging since 2013 and a nearly 82% population decrease over the past 22 years. PCR screening confirmed the circulation of P. multocida and E. rhusiopathiae, both previously reported in 1995\u20131996. a high prevalence of shedding adult brown skuas was found for P. multocida. skuas are involved in P. multocida inter-species transmission on Amsterdam Island. disease agents Almost pure, high density P. multocida colonies grew in cultures from tissues sampled from six carcasses. acute disease onset is common for avian cholera and has been reported globally. complex interactions between variability in the virulence of Mycoplasma strains and immune response of host individuals and populations have been suggested to explain differential epidemiological dynamics. this topic would notably require more attention on Amsterdam Island, especially as strong differential effects appear to exist between albatrosses and skuas. the introduction of the specific P. multocida strain that has likely been causing avian cholera outbreaks over the last three decades may be anthropogenic. however, the absence of genetic diversity in bacterial strains isolated from distinct seabird species in this study supports a single introduction event followed by the endemisation of this bacterial pathogen on Amsterdam Island. the demographic situation of the seabird community on Amsterdam Island has worsened over the past decade. molecular and bacteriological analyses suggest that P. multocida ST61 is responsible for significant and recurrent outbreaks in Indian yellow-nosed and sooty albatross chicks. but not for the northern rockhopper penguin for which further investigations are required. brown rats were identified as a major reservoir, then a control of this invasive species would be expected to have a major positive impact on seabird population dynamics. a control of this invasive species would be expected to have a major positive impact on seabird population dynamics."}
