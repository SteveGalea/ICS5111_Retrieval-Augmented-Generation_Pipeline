{"summary": "pathogenic infections are a leading cause of ALI/ARDS. pulmonary endothelium plays a critical role in lung homeostasis. ACE2 is a membrane-associated aminopeptidase expressed in multiple lung cell types. miR-454 [13] and miR-125b [14] have been identified to reduce the severity of LPS-induced ALI. few studies have investigated the miRNA regulators of ACE2 in ALI/ARDS. this study was undertaken to identify and functionally characterize potential miRNA regulators of ACE2. PMVECs were co-transfected with a miRNA-resistant variant of ACE2 (1 g) and miR-1246 mimic (50 nM) prior to the treatment with LPS. the plasmid was generated by cloning human ACE2 cDNA lacking the 3\u2019-UTR into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with FITC-labeled dUTP. mice were anesthetized and intratracheally administered with control inhibitor or anti-miR-1246. the pellet was re-suspended in PBS and total cells were counted with a hemacytometer. protein quantification was achieved using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit. sections of lung tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the supernatant was subjected to myeloperoxidase activity assay using a commercially available kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) absorbance was determined at 460 nm. treatment Human PMVECs were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) cells were treated with LPS (1 g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 48 h [16]. luciferase reporter assay was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pMIR-REPORT Luciferase miRNA expression reporter vector. hek-293T cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 3 104 cells per well and transfected with wild-type or mutated ACE2 3\u2019-UTR reporter constructs. mice were anesthetized and intratracheally administered with control inhibitor or anti-miR-1246 + LPS. after 24 h, animals were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected. cytospin slides were prepared and stained with DiffQuick. all experiments were performed as per the approval by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Shanghai, China) the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in conditioned medium of PMVECs or BAL fluids were analyzed with corresponding ELISA kits. rabbit anti-ACE2 polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution; Abcam, London, UK), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; Abcam), rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) delivery of miR-1246 mimic reduced the protein expression of ACE2 by about 70%, compared with control miRNA-transfected cells. delivery of miR-1246 mimic had no significant impact on the expression of miR-574 and miR-936 in PMVECs. luciferase reporter containing wild-type (wt) but not mutated (mut) ACE2 3\u2019-UTR. predicted target site for miR-1246 in the ACE2 3\u2019-UTR is shown in top panels. induced apoptosis and inflammatory responses in PMVECs involve elevation of miR-1246 expression. miR-1246 is involved in LPS-triggered apoptosis and inflammatory response in PMVECs. miR-1246 promotes PMVEC apoptosis by repressing ACE2 expression. a: Western blot analysis of ACE2 in PMVECs transfected with indicated constructs. inhibition of miR-1246 attenuates LPS-induced lung inflammation. mice were intratracheally administered with control inhibitor or anti-miR-1246 (2 mg/kg) 24 h before exposure to LPS or PBS. miR-1246 mimic induces miR-1246 to target ACE2 expression in PMVECs. the expression of miR-421, miR-574, or miR-936 was not altered upon LPS exposure. delivery of miR-1246 mimic reduced the protein expression of ACE2 by about 70%. west blot analysis revealed that miR-1246 significantly inhibited ACE2 expression. miR-1246 mediates the negative effect of LPS on ACE2 expression in PMVECs. qRT-PCR analysis of miR-1246 expression in PMVECs. pretransfection with anti-miR-1246 inhibitors led to 45% inhibition of LPS-induced apoptosis. delivery of anti-miR-1246 inhibitors reduced the production of IL-1 and TNF- by about 42% and 60%, respectively, in LPS-treated PMVECs. miR-1246 promotes PMVEC apoptosis by repressing ACE2 expression. miR-1246 mimic decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increased expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Lung sections from mice injected with anti-miR-1246 inhibitors showed a marked reduction of infiltrating inflammatory cells in response to LPS. administration of anti-miR-1246 inhibitors alone did not alter lung injury scores. miR-1246 knockdown impaired the LPS-induced increase in total and neutrophil counts (Figure 5B), inflammatory cytokines (Figure 5C) and protein levels (Figure 5D) in the BAL fluid. ACE2 has been shown to affect multiple aspects of the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS [8,10,19]. miR-1246 inhibits ACE2 expression in PMVECs. ectopic expression of miR-1246 phenocopied the effects of LPS treatment on PMVECs. apoptotic death in haCaT keratinocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. ACE2 overexpression reversed miR-1246-induced suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression and enhancement of Bax expression. hypothesized that miR-1246 might contribute to LPS-induced ALI. recruitment of neutrophils in response to LPS has been reported to increase microvascular permeability during ALI. miR-1246 mediates LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis in vitro and lung inflammation and permeability in vivo. this miRNA may represent a potential therapeutic target for ALI/ARDS."}
