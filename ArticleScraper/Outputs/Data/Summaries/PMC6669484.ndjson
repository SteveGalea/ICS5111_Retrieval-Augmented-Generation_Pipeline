{"summary": "peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild small ruminants. the disease was first reported in the Ivory Coast area of west africa in 1942. the virus is a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. type I IFNs bind to IFN-/ receptors to induce autophosphorylation of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers that bind to IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). paramyxoviruses have evolved multiple strategies to counteract IFN-mediated antiviral effect through different viral proteins. the P gene products of paramyxoviruses have been implicated in blocking host IFN response. the P protein blocks STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation through interacting with STAT1 and STAT2. the HEK-293T cells were grown to 50% confluency and then infected with 0.1 MOI of PPRV. the infected cells were treated with IFN and subjected to subsequent analysis. the commercial antibodies used in this study were as follows. proteins of PPRV strain Nigeria 75/1 were reverse transcribed from PPRV RNA using M-MLV (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 mammalian expression vector (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) the cDNAs of JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 were obtained from inserts previously cloned in pcDNA GCGGATATCTACTGTGTTCATCATCATACTGTC STAT2 Forward: ATTTGCGCGCATCATGGCGCAGTGGGAAATGCTGC TYK2 Forward: GCGGATATCGCACACGCTGAACACTGAAGGGGC IRF9 Forward: ATTTGCGCGCATCATCATCATGCCTCTGCGCT Reverse: GCGGATATCCACCAGGGACAGAATGGCTGCCTG N Forward: TTGTCGCGCGCGCGCGCG HEK-293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids and indicated plasmids coding for viral proteins using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) at 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed using passive cell lysis buffer (Promega) immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting analysis. membranes were blocked by 5% skimmed milk for 1 h. membranes were exposed by chemiluminescence reagents. cDNA was reverse transcribed using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random hexamers. TB Green Premix ExTaq Reagent (Takara, Dalian, China) were used for real-time quantitative PCR using a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time QPCR System. a two-tailed p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. p 0.01 and p 0.001 values are marked as \u201c**\u201d and \u201c***\u201d to indicate corresponding results were highly significant. anti-STAT2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p\u2013STAT1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-p\u2013STAT2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) cDNA encoding for viral proteins of PPRV strain Nigeria 75/1 was reverse transcribed from PPRV RNA using M-MLV (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) the pISRE-Luc, pGAS-Luc, and pRL-TK control plasmids were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) the primers used for plasmids construction and their corresponding sequences are listed in Table 1.

HEK-293T cells in 24 well culture plates were transfected with ISRE (100 ng) or GAS (100 ng) plasmids. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated or mock treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) the expression of viral P protein was detected by Western blotting. expression of Antiviral Genes IFN induces expression of a crucial series of host cellular genes. some of these genes are commonly inducible by both IFN- and IFN-. others are only selectively induced by either IFN- or IFN-. IFN- initiates upregulation of a set of downstream ISGs. the cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (A) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (B) for 12 h at 24 h post-transfection. expression of the viral proteins was detected by Western blotting. the expression of N and P proteins was also detected by Western blotting. this results indicate that PPRV N and P proteins blocked the nuclear transportation of STAT1 stimulated by IFN- or IFN-. HEK-293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged N protein expressing plasmids or vector plasmids along with a series of plasmids expressing Myc-tagged JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2 or IRF9. phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2 stimulated by IFN- was not affected by expression of N protein as well. HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of N protein expressing plasmids. the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody. the cells were then treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (D) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (E) for 30 min. truncated mutants expressing the core domain and tail domain of N protein were constructed. expression of each truncation was confirmed by Western blot analysis. the effects of core domain (N-core) and tail domain (N-tail) on IFN responses were separately evaluated. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with empty vector, N, N-core or N-tail expressing plasmids for 24 h. the cells were then treated with IFN- (E or IFN- (F) for 12 h. the subcellular localization of STAT1 was detected (Red) one-hundred cells were counted in the randomly selected visual fields for three times. the STAT1 nuclear localization ratio was determined. HEK-293T cells were transfected with P protein expressing plasmids for 24 h. phosphorylation of STAT1 was dramatically impaired by PPRV infection. expression of ISGs in goat fibroblasts was further detected. the relative fold change of p\u2013STAT1 was determined by densitometric analysis after being normalized to -actin. hek-293T cells were infected with PPRV for 48 h and then treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (C) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (D) for 30 min. tyrosine 110 (Y110) of the PPRV V protein, the key amino acid involved in the interaction between V and STAT1, was involved in inhibiting IFN signaling. to avoid a conformational change-mediated explanation, Y110 was substituted with either a basic amino acid residue (histidine, H) or an aromatic amino acid residue (phenylalanine, F) HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or P protein expressing plasmids, Y110H or Y110F. cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) for 12 h at 24 h post-transfection. luciferase activity was determined by qPCR analysis. induced by IFN- were clearly higher in the Y110H or Y110F mutant expressing cells than in the WT P protein expressing cells. but the mutation of Y110 did not fully recover the total (100%) activity. expression of antiviral-related genes stimulated by IFN- or IFN- were further evaluated and analyzed. cells were mock-treated or treated with IFN- and IFN-. results showed that IFN- incubation significantly activated ISRE promoter activation. however, PPRV N, P, and V proteins significantly impaired the activation of both ISRE promoter activation and GAS promoter activation. HEK-293T cells in 24 well culture plates were transfected with ISRE (100 ng) or GAS (100 ng) reporter plasmids together with pRL-TK (10 ng) plasmids and 200 ng of various PPRV viral protein expressing plasmids or vector plasmids. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated or mock treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) or IFN- ( IFN- initiates upregulation of a set of downstream ISGs. mRNA levels of ISG54, ISG15, OAS1 and MxA were measured in the IFN-treated cells. IFN- induced high expression of these ISGs in empty vector plasmids transfected cells. qPCR analysis of antiviral genes was performed to determine relative mRNA expression levels. expression of viral proteins was detected by Western blotting. heLa cells (5 104) were grown in the glass bottom dish. the cells were transfected with N protein expressing plasmids (2 g), P protein expressing plasmids (2 g) or vector plasmids (2 g) followed by IFN- (2000 U/mL) or IFN- (200 ng/mL) treatment for 30 min. lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibody and then subjected to Western blotting analysis. lysates were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. HEK-293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of N protein expressing plasmids. the cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (B) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (C) at 24 h post-transfection for 30 min. expression of N and -actin was subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected using appropriate antibodies. the effects of core domain (N-core) and tail domain (N-tail) on IFN responses were separately evaluated. the N-core domain exerted a crucial suppressive effect upon IFN-induced GAS promoter activation. the N-tail domain exerted a crucial suppressive effect upon IFN--induced GAS promoter activation, while the N-tail domain did not. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with ISRE (C) or GAS (D) reporter plasmids. empty vector, N, N-core or N-tail expressing plasmids for 24 h. the cells were then treated with IFN- (E) or IFN- (F) for 12 h. only STAT1 co-precipitated with P protein, while P protein showed no inhibitory effect on the expression of adaptor molecules. a clear cytoplastic co-localization pattern between P protein and endogenous STAT1 was observed as well. HEK-293T cells were transfected with P protein expressing plasmids. the cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (C) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (D) HEK-293T cells were infected with PPRV for 48 h and treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) (E) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) (F) for 30 min. the cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodies against pSTAT1, STAT1, and -Actin. interaction between V and STAT1 was involved in inhibiting IFN signaling. we also investigated whether the Y110 of PPRV P protein was involved in the P protein-mediated antagonistic effect involving STAT1 observed here. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or P protein expressing plasmids, Y110H or Y110F. the cells were treated with IFN- (1000 U/mL) or IFN- (100 ng/mL) for 12 h at 24 h post-transfection. the relative mRNA expression levels of ISG54, ISG15, IRF1 and STAT1 were then measured and compared. the expression of antiviral-related genes stimulated by IFN- or IFN- were further evaluated and analyzed. the expression of antiviral-related genes stimulated by IFN- or IFN- were increased in the Y110H or Y110F mutant expressing cells than in the WT P protein expressing cells. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus N protein inhibits IFN production by interacting with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and disrupting the association of interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) with TBK1 [39]. hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein interacts with the protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) the NiV N protein inhibits the nuclear transportation of STAT1 and STAT2. the protein also impaired the host IFN response by blocking JAK-STAT pathway signaling. P proteins of paramyxoviruses have two main functions in the viral life cycle. they function as a cofactor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. they also serve as a guardian for the correct assembly of nucleocapsids. yrosine 110 (Y110) in the P protein is critical for its interaction with STAT1. mutation of Y110 in the P protein completely abrogated its interaction with STAT1. the Y110 in the MV P protein is also required to block STAT1 phosphorylation."}
