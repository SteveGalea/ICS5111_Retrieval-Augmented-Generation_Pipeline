{"summary": "During the SARS pandemic of 2003, 8,098 people were infected and 774 died (3). subsequent sampling identified a closely related SARS-like virus in Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) (4) and bats in the region (2, 5) viruses similar to those that cause serious diseases in humans and agricultural animals have been detected in bats. experimental infections of multiple bat species with Ebolavirus (24), Marburg virus (25), MERS coronavirus (26), Nipah virus (27), and Hendra virus (28) have demonstrated limited viraemia in bats. these studies raise further questions about adaptation in bat antiviral immune responses. in the closely related Jamaican fruit bat, 466 immune-related genes have been identified by transcriptome analysis. 2.75% of genes (roughly 407 genes) in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are immune-related (39). 7% of the human genome represents immune genes (40) in human cells, endosomal TLRs 3, 7, and 8 detect viral RNAs (35) full-length transcripts for TLR 1- TLR10 have been sequenced in P. alecto and a TLR13 pseudogene has been detected (44), but their functions in bats have not been fully characterized. dsRNA sensing machinery is conserved between bat and human cells. FNs in response to stimulation with poly(I:C) (46) are conserved and functional in bat cells. cytosolic RNA sensors are conserved and functional in bat cells. cytosolic RNA sensors are conserved and functional in bat cells. IFNs bind to interferon receptors (IFNAR; IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on infected and neighboring cells to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway via kinases such as Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) that phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (STAT1 and STAT2) induce the expression of interfer lack of a strong inflammatory response in virally infected bat immune cells has also been attributed to low levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. strong and chronic inflammation has been associated with poor disease prognosis and health issues in humans and other susceptible animal models. widespread tissue distribution in bats compared to in humans and mice. knockdown of IRF7 in P. alecto and E. fuscus cells significantly reduced the induction of mRNA encoding IFN following infection with the mouse paramyxovirus Sendai virus. the type I IFN encoding locus is contracted in the P. alecto genome. it has only 10 IFN loci, including three functional IFN loci. fewer than any other mammalian species (15) henipavirus infection antagonizes type I and type III IFN production and signaling in P. alecto cells. henipavirus infection antagonizes type I and type III IFN production and signaling in human cells. henipavirus infection antagonizes type I and type III IFN production. ase 1 (OAS1), IFN-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) and myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) are also inducible in P. alecto bat cells in an IFN dose-dependent manner. ectopic expression of Mx1 from six different bat species reduced ebolavirus and influenza A virus replication in human embryonic kidney cells. atypical ISGs have not been characterized as antiviral genes in bats or other mammals, including humans and murine species. these observations raise additional questions about the possibility of virus-specific antiviral genes that are induced independently of IFNs in bat cells. however, these observations have been made in primary and immortalized cell lines. several unique ISGs and atypical induction of ISGs have been observed in bat cells (73) in human cells, expression of individual ISGs can inhibit virus replication, such as ISG20 that displays remarkable anti-bunyavirus activity (76). studies in bat cells highlight the antiviral roles of less studied IFNs, such as IFN and IFN (65). Detection of exogenous or self DNA leads to activation of downstream mediators and expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines. a recent study found that the ability of stimulator of IFN genes (STING) to induce IFN expression is dampened in bat cells due to the loss of a serine residue at position 358. IFN-inducible gene 16 (IFI16), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) and IFN-inducible protein X (IFIX) can detect exogenous and self-DNA. receptors signal through adaptor proteins to activate cellular kinases, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 protein (TBK1). arrows indicate dampened response in the pathway relative to human cells. the data have been compiled from studies in different species. one finding may not represent a universal bat response. mRNA transcripts from DNA viruses could be sensed by RIG-I in bat cells to initiate an antiviral response. it is unlikely that bats have lost all forms of exogenous and endogenous DNA sensing machinery since DNA viruses have been detected and isolated from multiple species of bats. binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors are intracellular PRRs that can recognize nucleic acids from invading viruses. NLRP3 and NOD-, LRR- and CARD-containing 5 (NLRC5) have been identified in the transcriptome of P. alecto (37) but only NLRP3 has been functionally characterized in bats (17) the role of TLR3 in sensing exogenous dsRNA has been confirmed in cells from the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) (49) 63% of bat TLR8 genes have evolved under purifying selection. 7% of amino acid sequences that make up the ligand-binding domain of TLR8 differ between bat and other mammalian TLR8 proteins. RIG-I and MDA5 from P. alecto have similar primary structures and patterns of tissue expression compared to their human counterparts. cytosolic RNA sensors are conserved and functional in bat cells. in-turn activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or IRF7 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFB) to stimulate the expression of interferons (IFNs) such as IFNs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL8, TNF, and IL1 respectively. the lack of a strong inflammatory response in virally infected bat immune cells has also been attributed to low levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. strong and chronic inflammation has been associated with poor disease prognosis and health issues in humans. in both P. alecto and E. fuscus cells, IRF7 is induced in response to poly(IC) stimulation (49, 60) cytoplasmic adaptor proteins of TLRs and cellular kinases that activate IRF3 and IRF7 have not been studied in bats. the type I IFN encoding locus is contracted in the P. alecto genome. it has only 10 IFN loci, including three functional IFN loci. henipavirus infection antagonizes type I and type III IFN production and signaling in P. alecto cells. henipavirus infection antagonizes type I and type III IFN production and signaling in human cells. DA5, RIG-I, radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing 2 (RSAD2), IRF7, 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), IFN-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) and myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) are also inducible in P. alecto bat cells in an IFN dose-dependent manner. ribonuclease L (RNase L) is inducible by IFNs in P. vampyrus kidney cells. expression of atypical ISGs also observed in immortalized P. vampyrus kidney cells infected with Newcastle disease virus. several unique ISGs and atypical induction of ISGs have been observed in bat cells (51, 52, 75) the effects of expressing homologs of atypical bat ISGs in human cells have not been studied. studies in bat cells also highlight the antiviral roles of less studied IFNs, such as IFN and IFN (65). IFN-inducible gene 16 (IFI16), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) and IFN-inducible protein X (IFIX) can detect exogenous or self DNA (86, 93) Detection of exogenous or self DNA leads to activation of downstream mediators and expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines. endosomal TLR9 and cytosolic receptors from the PYHIN family (86) signal through STING and the NLRP3 inflammasome. the attenuated function of STING would extend to other DNA sensors that signal through STING. the presence and function of additional homologs of DNA sensors have not been characterized in bats. red arrows indicate a dampened response in the pathway, relative to human cells. one finding may not represent a universal bat response. selective pressure of DNA damage and release of self-DNA may have selected for the loss of certain cytosolic sensors of DNA in bat cells. polIII (89) may have been positively selected for in bats to compensate for the loss of the PYHIN family of proteins and the lack of activation of STING. nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors are intracellular PRRs that can recognize nucleic acids from invading viruses. genes encoding the NOD-like receptors NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) have been identified in the transcriptome of P. alecto (37) but only NLRP3 has been functionally characterized in bats (17) Adaptive Immunity in Bats There are limited studies on adaptive immune responses in bats. recent developments in the identification and development of bat cross-reactive antibodies along with the establishment of captive bat experimental colonies have facilitated advancement in this area. gammaherpesvirus (EfHV) genomic sequences did not contain neutralizing antibodies against the virus (79). Approximately half of the animals seroconverted and had relatively low titres of virus-neutralizing antibody, but the bats were not necessarily protected from virus replication and shedding. serological data may provide valuable information about virus circulation at the population level. iacus challenged with MARV 17-24 months after primary exposure exhibited a robust MARV-specific antibody response. bats previously exposed to MARV exhibited some virus replication, but no detectable virus shedding. this finding suggests bats still maintain protective immunity. the total number of CD3+ T cells expressing IL-17A, IL-22, or TGF1 did not increase. there was an increase in the frequency of T cells expressing TNF, IL-10, IFN, IL-2, granzyme B, and perforin. antibodies that recognize bat Ig, MHC-II, CD21, and CD27 were identified. bat MHC molecules can accommodate larger peptides, compared to other mammals. the three amino acids formed an additional salt bridge that could potentially present high affinity peptides during the peptide exchange process in bat cells. this could be due to their co-evolution with viruses. progenitor cells and cellular differentiation have not been studied in bats. some studies on myeloid and lymphoid cells have been carried out. most studies on bat immune-relevant cells have been carried out on bats. chimeric bat-mice were able to respond to immune stimuli and produce antigen-specific antibodies. the proportion of immune cells subsets does not recapitulate the immune cell frequencies observed in vivo in bats thus far. seronegative bats had no detectable virus replication or shedding (25), a subsequent study identified non-neutralizing antibodies following MARV, EBOV, and sosuga virus (SOSV) infection. serological data can help distinguish between possible hypotheses to identify mechanisms of viral persistence and circulation in bats. henipavirus serology from captive Eidolon helvum bats in Ghana best fit the data 117. aegyptiacus challenged with MARV 17-24 months after primary exposure exhibited a robust MARV-specific antibody response. however, bats previously exposed to MARV exhibited some virus replication, but no detectable viremia or oral shedding of virus. wild-caught P. alecto bats showed a predominance of CD8+ T cells in the spleen. CD4+ T cells were the most prevalent lymphocyte in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. in vivo studies, attempts have been made to decipher adaptive immunity in bats using primary cells, immortalized cell lines and ex vivo cell cultures. crude bone-marrow derived myeloid cell preparations from E. fuscus were used to validated dsRNA sensing. bat macrophages, putative monocytes and putative cDCs are phagocytic. on stimulation with poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand), Mx1 (ISG) transcript levels increased in all three cell types. however, FLT3L-generated bat DCs induced high levels of IFN2 transcripts on poly(I:C) stimulation. this is consistent with observations in mice and humans suggesting that bone-marrow-derived bat DCs share reagents are being identified and developed that can be used to study bat immunology. 80-100 chimeric bat-mice were developed to study the bat immune system by reconstituting bat immune cells in these mice. chimeric bat-mice were able to respond to immune stimuli and produce antigen-specific antibody responses. bats infected with henipaviruses do not develop clinical signs of disease. henipavirus infection of P. alecto lung cells inhibits IFN production. experimental Nipah virus infection of bat cells has been shown to inhibit IFN production. 3ABC proteases of human hepatitis viruses cleave MAVS to evade the innate immune response (137) there are limited studies that have studied the functional conservation and ability of bat molecules to stimulate antiviral signaling pathways in human cells. wild bat populations are vulnerable to multiple environmental stressors, including seasonal fluctuations in food availability, climatic-stressors, and anthropogenic disturbances. each of these environmental stressors can affect multiple barriers to pathogen spillover (23, 141) experimental rabies virus infection studies in bats have led to conflicting conclusions about the nature of disease. there is a need to study viruses that cause disease in bats and associated immunological consequences in these bats. the role of co-infection in modulating immune responses in bats needs to be investigated. pavlovich et al. did not detect constitutive expression of IFN in cells from R. aegyptiacus (16), whereas type I IFN locus is contracted in P. alecto (15). the limitations of studying bat-virus interactions also extend to the tools that are currently available. s, such as mutations detected during sequential passages of marburg virus in mice and cell-culture (150) there is a need to isolate bat viruses and generate virus stocks that have been propagated in cells from the same species of bat. it has been particularly challenging to isolate bat viruses and only fragments of viral genomes have been detected for multiple bat-borne viruses. studies have shown that bats are resistant to MERS-CoV protein-mediated modulation of antiviral responses (26, 59) similar studies need to be undertaken for other bat-borne viruses."}
