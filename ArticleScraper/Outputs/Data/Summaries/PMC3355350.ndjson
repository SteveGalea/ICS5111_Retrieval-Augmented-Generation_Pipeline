{"summary": "direct detection and identification of influenza strains from clinical samples are mostly performed by using specific real-time PCR assays. the influenza A(H1N1)pdm pandemic in 2009 resulted in the development of a number of assays, such as single/multiplex real-time RT-PCR [3-6] or microarray systems [7, 8], allowing the rapid detection and typing of influenza virus in human specimens. PLEX-ID/Flu assay includes one pan-influenza primer set targeting the PB1 segment, five pan-influenza-A primer pairs targeting individually NP, M1, PA, PB2 and NS1 genes. nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from a network of more than 80 practitioners participated actively to the clinical surveillance of influenza cases in Switzerland. NPS were selected blind of the real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (CT) values and the type of influenza (influenza A or B) for each assay, specific positive and negative internal controls were included systematically in each run. the PLEX-ID/Flu assay detected positively and gave a typing/lineage characterization result for 93% of all NPS detected positively by real-time RT-PCR assays. the typing performance of the PLEX-ID/Flu assay was then compared for all influenza specimens with low viral loads. 1R1 primers were used for the first PCR reaction, followed by a nested PCR using the BHA25/BHAF primer pair. the PLEX-ID/Flu assay was able to subtype 9/19 influenza A (47.5%) and characterize the lineage for 14/18 influenza B (50%). the Sanger-based sequencing method was able to subtype 13/19 influenza A (68.4%) and identify the lineage for 9/18 influenza B (77.8%). the PLEX-ID/Flu assay is a convenient platform for the detection, typing, and subtyping (lineage characterization for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses. the detection rate observed with the PLEX-ID platform, as well as the subtyping or lineage characterization of human influenza virus types A and B tends to suggest it might play a role in the near future."}
