{"summary": "acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined as a rapidly progressive acute onset respiratory failure (arterial hypoxemia with PO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level) this complex syndrome is caused by a variety of insults, such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, non-pulmonary sepsis, major trauma, amniotic fluid embolism, transfusions, aspiration of gastric contents. bronchoalveolar lavage (5,6) and lung biopsy (7,8) are accompanied with high risk of pneumothorax development. pathophysiologically, ARDS is the result of inflammatory lung injury. diseased lung parenchyma seems to have a remarkable heterogenic distribution. pneumothorax must always be suspected in any patient with ARDS who experiences an acute worsening in respiratory function. small pneumothoraces in these patients can cause severe hemodynamic or pulmonary compromise. this is the reason why pneumothorax must always be suspected in any patient with ARDS who experiences an acute worsening in respiratory function. Chest CT is helpful in understanding the extent of the underlying lung parenchyma distraction and is quite sensitive in identifying pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. 32% of all patients presented a loculated pneumothorax (mostly anteromedial) and 30% had pulmonary air cysts (always multiple and mostly bilateral) (17,18) lung-ultrasonography is a relatively easy to perform, portable and inexpensive diagnostic imaging. persistent air leaks prolong pneumothorax in 2% of cases of ARDS. bronchopleural fistula, persistent air leaks and bilateral pneumothorax are at highest risk for development of barotrauma. many radiologic findings have been described as a result of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. ventilation parameters such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure level, respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute ventilation, are considered to be significant in barotrauma development. pneumothorax development seems to correlate strongly with applied end-inspiratory pressure [P(plat)], especially when exceeding 35 cm of water (cm H2O) and with pulmonary compliance. the development of pneumothorax in an ARDS patient under mechanical ventilation support is a fearful complication as it results in prolongation of mechanical ventilation. many ventilation parameters such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure level, respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute ventilation are considered to be significant in barotrauma development. the use of lung-protective ventilator strategies is strongly associated with a reduced risk of pneumothorax and persistent air leak in ARDS patients. despite the plethora of well documented lung protective ventilation strategies, for patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute ARDS, many ICU fail to apply those. a proportion of 30.2% developed an air leak lasting more than 7 days or died with an air leak. peak airway pressure remained the significant predictor in multivariated analysis. recruitment technics using PEEP were found to correlate with significant increase of incidence of pneumothorax (38) in patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness. a prolonged curarization in ARDS patients of 48 h or more was proved to be beneficial regarding systemic oxygenation. the use of neuromuscular blocking, like cisatracurium, also seems to facilitate mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. 156 adult patients with severe ARDS underwent trials of HFOV after conventional ventilation failure. pneumothorax occurred in 21.8% of patients (49) in adult critically ill patients the incidence of pneumothorax during HFOV seems to approach 20%. the application of ECMO allows the reduction of peak and mean airway pressures, tidal volumes, ventilator rate, minute volume and inspiratory oxygen concentration (54). the application of ECMO may result in chest radiographic patterns, such as mixed alveolar-reticular opacifications, alveolar patterns or reticular opacities, making the diagnosis difficult from chest X-rays (55). ARDS unresponsive to conventional ventilation, after open heart surgery, with only 22 reports of pneumothorax as major complication (45) in adult critically ill patients the incidence of pneumothorax during HFOV seems to approach 20% (47-49) in adult critically ill patients the incidence of pneumothorax during HFOV seems to approach 20%. the application of ECMO allows the reduction of peak and mean airway pressures, tidal volumes, ventilator rate, minute volume and inspiratory oxygen concentration (54). however, it must be kept in mind that pneumothorax remains one of the most frequent complications. the application of ECMO may result in chest radiographic patterns, such as mixed alveolar-reticular opacifications or alveolar patterns."}
