{"summary": "zoonotic viruses have successfully jumped the ecological and evolutionary species barriers to generate sustained epidemics. cross-species transmissions (CSTs) may trigger major epidemics such as those caused by HIV/AIDS, influenza type A virus and SARS coronavirus. infections caused by CST can result in little or no onwards transmission in the recipient species, such as in rabies virus infection in humans. Streicker et al. [5] applied a structured population genetics approach to viral sequence subsets for pairs of host species. different hypotheses of CST directionality were tested for each pair of species that was infected by a common viral lineage. estimates for migration rate ij were obtained using Migrate [15] the authors also explored host shifts using a phylogenetic diffusion approach [17] and found some support for a correlation between host shifting and phylogenetic similarity between the hosts. the authors also explored host shifts using a phylogenetic diffusion approach. genetic and epidemiological data Host species, spatial locations and sampling collection year were annotated for 372 nucleoprotein gene sequences (nucleotide positions: 594\u20131353) this data comprised a total of 17 bat species sampled between 1997 and 2006 across 14 states in the united states. to test different determinants of viral dispersal between localities, we considered three distinct predictors. the number of rabies virus cases in bats in each of the relevant US states during 2010 [19] and geographical area in square kilometres of each state. phylogenetic diffusion model parametrizes these rates as a log-linear function of an arbitrary number of predictors [20]. this GLM specifies coefficients (i) for each predictor pi, allowing the estimation of their contribution to the diffusion process, as well as (0,1)-indicator variables (i) to model the inclusion or exclusion of each predictor. the external/internal GLM branch partitioning (BP) was used to investigate predictors of CST and host shifts. we apply this partitioning simultaneously with a separate homogeneous GLM diffusion model [20] to investigate predictors of spatial diffusion. a maximum clade credibility tree was inspected using Tracer. all analyses were performed using the BEAGLE library to enhance computation speed. a total of 17 bat species sampled between 1997 and 2006 across 14 states in the united states. the number of rabies virus cases in bats in each of the relevant US states during 2010 [19] is a crude proxy for population size in the absence of such numbers for each bat species. this approach uses a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) to model discrete outcomes as a continuous function of time in temporally calibrated phylogenetic trees. inclusion or exclusion of each predictor can be expressed as a Bayes factor (BF) [20]. all predictors were log transformed and standardized, except for the overlap of roost structures, which was coded as a vector of binary indicators for sharing. beAST with BEAGLE inference Discrete phylogenetic diffusion analyses were performed under an asymmetric diffusion model [22] using markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in beAST v. 1.7 [23]. two chains of 2.5 108 steps, sub-sampled every 50,000th generation were combined after discarding 10 per cent of the generations from each generation as burn-in. we first adopted a recently developed GLM extension of a Bayesian phylogenetic diffusion model that has been introduced in a phylogeographic context [20]. we consider host genetic distance, geographical range overlap and similarities in roost structures, wing aspect ratio, wing loading and body size as potential predictors. coefficients above zero indicate a positive correlation between the intensity of viral host jumping and the extent of geographical range overlap. for each potential predictor, the Bayes factor (BF) support and the conditional effect sizes (cESs) obtained using a homogeneous (squares) and a branch-partitioned GLM diffusion approach (circles) implemented in BEAST are shown. the results obtained using the branch-partitioned GLM diffusion model strongly support that the intensity of recent CST and historical host shifts is predicted by host genetic similarity. the results also show that some degree of geographical range overlap is required for recent CST spillover, but it is not a significant predictor of established host shifts. BF = 6516, with a cES of 1.14 (95% BCI: 1.43, 0.86); figure 3. this provides decisive support for the notion that viral dispersal occurs mostly between closely located regions rather than through long distance dispersal. this provides decisive support for the notion that viral dispersal occurs mostly between closely located regions rather than through long distance dispersal, despite the mobility of some bat species. a total of 31 CST connections were implied by the transmission web in the previously published transmission web. the four additional host-transitioning rates may reflect host jumps ancestral to the host-associated lineages or more subtle CST dynamics within those lineages. the width of the transitions between pairs of host species reflects the magnitude of the strongly supported transition rates. the naming of the bat species is consistent with the legend of figure 1. a lower BF invokes many more uncertain rates that yield less convincing support for their involvement in CST. we first adopted a recently developed GLM extension of a Bayesian phylogenetic diffusion model that has been introduced in a phylogeographic context [20]. we consider host genetic distance, geographical range overlap and similarities in roost structures, wing aspect ratio, wing loading and body size as potential predictors. coefficients above zero indicate a positive correlation between the intensity of viral host jumping and the extent of geographical range overlap. for each potential predictor, the Bayes factor (BF) support and the conditional effect sizes (cESs) obtained using a homogeneous (squares) and a branch-partitioned GLM diffusion approach (circles) implemented in BEAST are shown. the results obtained using the branch-partitioned GLM diffusion model strongly support that the intensity of both recent CST and historical host shifts is predicted by host genetic similarity. the results also show that some degree of geographical range overlap is required for recent CST spillover, but it is not a significant predictor of established host shifts. BF = 6516, with a cES of 1.14 (95% BCI: 1.43, 0.86); figure 3. this provides decisive support for the notion that viral dispersal occurs mostly between closely located regions rather than through long distance dispersal. this provides decisive support for the notion that viral dispersal occurs mostly between closely located regions rather than through long distance dispersal, despite the mobility of some bat species. 80% of the 19 well-supported rates are represented by connections in the previously published transmission web. the four additional host-transitioning rates inferred with strong support by our approach may reflect host jumps ancestral to the host-associated lineages. the width of the transitions between pairs of host species reflects the magnitude of the strongly supported transition rates. the naming of the bat species is consistent with the legend of figure 1. the naming of the bat species is consistent with the legend of figure 1. phylogenetic diffusion models are now frequently being used for phylogeographic analyses. but also the inference of host jumping has become of interest. the most important contribution of the current work is the extension of a GLM diffusion model that allows the inference of the discrete state transition history. the rabies phylogeny is generally characterized by very short tips. this suggests that external branches of the phylogeny most likely represented dead-end infections than infections occurring within stuttering chains of transmission in the recipient species. this does not formally rule out the possibility of stuttering chains along the external branches. the strength of the current approach and Streicker et al. [5] is the ability to demonstrate phylogenetic barriers at two stages: emergence and establishment. however, the generality of this phenomenon remains to be investigated in other systems. geographical range overlap is a modest, but non-negligible, predictor of successful CST from animal reservoir species to humans. a relatively longstanding rabies transmission dynamics may represent only a small part of the history of rabies in north America. the common ancestor of modern viral strains does not necessarily extend back to the origin of the virus [43]. there could be missing lineages in the tree (undiscovered viruses), and some inferred host shifts may actually have involved different donor species. our Bayesian phylogenetic diffusion approach attempts to estimate this connectivity. we also estimate the number of jumps along a set of strongly supported host transition pairs using robust counting techniques. a comparison of BF support for rates of diffusion (figure 4a) and posterior estimates of the number of jumps (figure 4b) indicates that high support does not necessarily translate into a consistently high intensity of jumps. rabies lineages associated with subtropical bat populations evolve nearly four times faster than those associated with temperate species. authors adopted hierarchical phylogenetic model (HPM) methodology [44] and incorporate fixed effects to allow to test differences in the evolutionary rate estimate for different groups of viral lineages."}
