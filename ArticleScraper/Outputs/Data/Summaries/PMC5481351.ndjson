{"summary": "two major competing scenarios have been proposed. viruses are very ancient and evolved (or co-existed) prior to the origin of modern cells. the debate is central to answering some of the toughest questions in biological research. ed on a large-scale data-driven study of the origins and evolution of viruses. we studied the evolution of protein fold superfamilies (FSFs) as defined by the Structural Classification of Proteins database. only a small proportion of FSF domains might have experienced convergent evolution. viral lineages originated multiple times in evolution (either by primordial reduction or escape; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; Nasir et al., 2012b; an evolutionary principal coordinate (evoPCO) analysis projecting a \u201cfour-domain\u201d view of cellular and viral proteomes rooted in evolutionary and geological time. we also ruled out the virus-late scenario because it implies little or no genetic overlap among archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses. authors criticized our phylogenomic methods and the virus-early scenario claiming that the basal position of viruses in our Harish et al. (2016) confused key concepts of our phylogenomic methodology. they downplayed \u201crules of thumb\u201d for taxa selection in genome content and composition-based phylogenies. they missed the crucial fact that our phylogenomic trees are reconstructed unrooted. thus, their topologies cannot be distorted a posteriori. Harish et al. (2016) reconstructed trees without paying attention to rooting, character polarization, and taxa sampling details. they added extreme examples of cellular endosymbionts that complicate the definition of valid taxa in phylogenetic reconstructions. unrooted trees describe relatedness of taxa based on graded compositional similarities of characters. a simple node distance (nd) vs. genome size plot dispels their putative SGA artifact for viruses. a simple node distance (nd) plot dispels their putative SGA artifact for viruses. our exclusion and inclusion of taxa ensured integrity of definition of taxa. exclusion of organisms engaged in obligate cellular endosymbiosis ensured integrity of definition of taxa. core-FSFs are widespread among archaeoviruses and bacterioviruses. a total of 10,427 instances of core-FSFs were detected in bacterioviruses compared to 5,823 in eukaryoviruses. authors do not provide any evidence to support their statements. et al. (2016) misunderstood rooting methodology, confused stability of rooting with leaf stability. they did not report tree metrics of any kind to test the validity of their trees. instead, their choice of adding rogue taxa destabilized their phylogenies. meric scale indicating 24 (or 32 or 64) possible character states (e.g., 0\u20139 and A\u2013N) representing FSF abundances in sampled taxa. resulting most parsimonious unrooted trees are then rooted using the Lundberg approach (Lundberg, 1972; i.e., a posteriori) which still preserves the optimized topology. the rooting method we applied is grounded in early and well-established cladistic formalizations (Farris, 1970; Lundberg, 1972) it polarizes character transformations with information solely present in ingroup taxa. character polarization is only applied empirically and a posteriori to root the trees. rooting involves orienting an unrooted tree and pulling down a branch that will hold the ancestor of all taxa examined. the outgroup node adds a character state vector that includes character state o. character state z is less distributed than y within the ingroup. the length of a tree is unaffected by the position of the root, making a priori polarization unnecessary. rooting impacts the homology statements of the undirected networks. at least 5 viruses from each known viral family/order (a total of 266 viruses belonging to 87 ICTV families) these trees included each major phyla/group in the same proportion that was present in the original 5,080-dataset. a single FSF could be present multiple times in the same genome owing to well-known evolutionary processes such as gene duplication, amplification and HGT. the interplay between FSF use (the domain vocabulary) and FSF reuse (the proteomic use of the domain vocabulary) of total (i.e., the entire repertoire) or universal (i.e., ABEV) FSFs contributes meaningful information to our data matrices. neither of the two alone can define genome size. a lack of correlation between ABEV FSF use and genome size for cellular organisms would be incorrect. a lack of correlation between occurrence and reuse (abundance) is a misleading proxy for genome size. taxa encoding 100 FSFs will still be distinguished from a bacterium encoding 100 FSFs. euryarchaeote Ignicoccus hospitalis was the smallest proteome. the archaeon did not appear at the root of the cellular subtree but appeared at a rather well derived position within the archaeal subtree. tree of proteomes is robust and insensitive to the effects of genome size. tree of proteomes is sensitive to holobiont relationships defining taxa. smallest proteomes for cells are indicated. distortions do not appear in our ToLs despite use-reuse value overlaps. addition of reduced proteomes of Rickettsia prowazeki and Nanoarchaeum equitans caused topological distortions and mixing of archaeal and bacteria taxa in the 60-taxon trees. to demonstrate the absence of a systemic SGA artifact, we plotted the \u201cnode distance\u201d (nd) from the root to each terminal node (i.e., taxa) of the ToL. the plots revealed substantial scatter, especially in viruses, and genome-size independent clustering of cellular proteomes indicating an absence of systemic SGA. to test, we selected 2 primates and 2 ascomycetes from Eukarya, 2 Crenarchaeota and 2 Euryarchaeota from Archaea, 2 Gamma-proteobacteria and 2 Firmicutes from Bacteria. the plot reveals high scatter, especially toward smaller nd values and clustering of eukaryal taxa in the same nd range. taxa were labeled both by use and reuse of ABEV FSFs. in the first reconstruction, we recovered the four-supergroup ToL without any topological mixing. taxon definitions and leaf stabilities prompt exclusion of cellular endosymbionts and inclusion of viruses in ToLs. cellular endosymbionts and obligate parasites harbor an FSF domain repertoire that is distinct from the other members of their respective superkingdoms. there are no \u201cfree-living\u201d viruses and this conflict does not exist in the virosphere. a number of viroviruses are different from cellular endosymbionts in their FSF composition profile (Figure 6) and therefore do not cause any distortion to the cellular subtrees. the intentional inclusion of problematic taxa is expected to generate biased reconstructions. cellular endosymbionts differ from free-living organisms and viruses in their FSF composition profiles. in unrooted trees, the smallest phylogenetic statement is the relationship of a quartet of leaves. an unstable leaf can lower the LS scores of the other leaves and affect the overall LS of the taxon set by either occurring in unstable quartets (direct effects) or by lowering the stability of quartets in which it does not occur (indirect effects) when there is character conflict. obligate parasites were added at the base of our ToL. similar results were obtained when alternative tree statistics were compared. LS difference and LS entropy were compared. cellular dependencies could result in viruses acting as rogue taxa in phylogenetic reconstructions. cellular dependencies could result in viruses acting as rogue taxa in phylogenetic reconstructions. taxon instability indices compute the variation of pair-wise patristic distances between taxon pairs across all trees. 8880 unrooted BS trees gain a 37% significant decrease (P 0.01) in taxonomic instability by replacement with the balanced 6666 BS set. 8880 6666 Decrease (%) taxon TII Taxon TII Taxon TII Acidobacterium capsulatum 339984.56 Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus 176059.76. inclusion of viral taxa significantly reduces tree instability.

Harish et al. (2016) did not report tree metrics, making their tree reconstructions open to speculative interpretations. these trees included each major phyla/group in the same proportion that was present in the original 5,080-dataset comprising 1,620 cellular organisms and 3,460 viruses. a single FSF could be present multiple times in the same genome owing to well-known evolutionary processes such as gene duplication, amplification and HGT. the interplay between FSF use (the domain vocabulary) and FSF reuse (the proteomic use of the domain vocabulary) of total (i.e., the entire repertoire) or universal (i.e., ABEV) FSFs contributes meaningful information to our data matrices. neither of the two alone can define genome size. phylogenomic data matrix shows lack of correlation between total FSF use and genome size for cellular organisms. a strong correlation between total FSF use and reuse for total (A) and universal ABEV FSF (B) sets for 368-taxon trees. archaeon encoding 100 FSFs will still be distinguished from a bacterium encoding 100 FSFs. labeling the phylogenetic positions of the \u201csmallest\u201d proteomes in our trees confirmed that the smallest genomes were not attracted toward the root. the euryarchaeote Ignicoccus hospitalis was the smallest proteome either by universal FSF use (n = 213 ABEV FSFs) or reuse (868) lowest FSF use (Lactobacillus delbrueckii, 261 FSFs) was not the smallest with FSF reuse (Aquifex aeolicus, 1,155 FSFs) the single most parsimonious tree (taxa = 368; characters = 442; length = 45,935, retention index = 0.83, g1 = 0.31). the addition of the extremely reduced proteomes of Rickettsia prowazeki and Nanoarchaeum equitans (Archaea, use = 131, reuse = 345) caused topological distortions and mixing of archaeal and bacteria taxa in the 60-taxon trees of Harish et al. (2016). it is interesting to note that N. equitans encodes a proteome even smaller than some \u201cgiant\u201d viruses such as Acantham to demonstrate the absence of a systemic SGA artifact, we plotted the \u201cnode distance\u201d (nd) from the root to each terminal node (i.e., taxa) of the ToL. the plots revealed substantial scatter, especially in viruses, and genome-size independent clustering of cellular proteomes indicating an absence of systemic SGA. data points for different supergroups are colored green (Eukarya), blue (Bacteria), black (Archaea) and red (viruses) to test, we selected 2 primates and 2 ascomycetes from Eukarya, 2 Crenarchaeota and 2 Euryarchaeota from Archaea, 2 mimiviridae and 2 phycodnaviridae. taxa were labeled both by use and reuse of ABEV FSFs. a single most parsimonious phylogenomic tree describes evolutionary relationships between four proteomes sampled each from viruses, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. taxon definitions and leaf stabilities prompt exclusion of cellular endosymbionts and inclusion of viruses in ToLs. cellular endosymbionts and obligate parasites harbor an FSF domain repertoire that is distinct from the other members of their respective superkingdoms. Viruses are also different from cellular endosymbionts in their FSF composition profile. they do not cause distortions to the cellular subtrees. these taxa were likely \u201ccherry-picked\u201d from extreme proteomic outliers. the intentional inclusion of problematic taxa is expected to generate biased reconstructions. cellular endosymbionts differ from free-living organisms and viruses in their FSF composition profiles. in unrooted trees, the smallest phylogenetic statement is the relationship of a quartet of leaves. the culprit of LS varying scores can be character incongruence imposed by problems in the definition of taxa and characters. an unstable leaf can lower the LS scores of the other leaves. obligate parasites were added. similar results were obtained when alternative tree statistics were compared. obligate parasites could be excluded from tree reconstructions. the persistence of viruses as a supergroup depends on viral interactions with cellular hosts. cellular dependencies could result in viruses acting as rogue taxa in phylogenetic reconstructions. the 8880 unrooted BS trees gain a 37% significant decrease (P 0.01) in taxonomic instability by replacements with the balanced 6666 BS set (Table 2). phylogenetic stability provides one more reason to include viruses in ToLs. 8880 6666 Decrease (%) Taxon TII Taxon TII Acidobacterium capsulatum 339984.56 Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus 176059.76 Archaeoglobus fulgidus 276206.40 0.004 Arcobacter butzleri 260465.25 33.07 Burkholderia sp. 384956.57 Burkholderia sp. 384956.57 smortui 245672.98 Haloarcula marismortui 227995.40 7.20 Haloquadratum walsbyi 227292.68 7.06 Lottia gigantea 244638.31 Lottia gigantea 51716.23 78.86 Methanoculleus marisnigri 216223.26 Methanoculleus marisnigri 193300.26 10.60 Methanosarcina ma two most stable taxa from each of archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya were replaced with viral proteomes used by Harish et al. (2016). evoPCO analysis combines the power of cladistics and phenetics. figure 9A shows an evoPCO analysis plot explaining in its first three major axes 85% variability in evolutionary distances between 368 cellular and viral proteomes. the plot revealed four distinct temporal clouds of proteomes for viruses, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya (Figure 9) and considerable scatter, with patterns resembling those of the nd plots previously described. evolutionary principal coordinate (evoPCO) analysis plot shows evolutionary distances between cellular and viral proteomes. most important evoPCO component plotted against universal ABEV FSF reuse in logarithm scale. the zipf law explains patterns of occurrence of Pfam domains in proteins that match words in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. the law explains patterns of occurrence of Pfam domains in proteins that match words in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. the law governs the size of domains in proteins and expresses a diminishing return tendency associated with trade-offs between economy of matter-energy and information in domain makeup. the law governs the size of domains in proteins and expresses a diminishing return tendency associated with trade-offs. study of deviations in tail distributions linked to the Heap law regression can estimate if a pan-genome representing a gene or domain core shared between a group of organisms will continue to expand when more genomes are explored. the steepest regime followed a Zipf law characterizing a \u201ckernel\u201d lexicon of frequently used words. the FSF use and reuse log-log plots of Figure 2 show not two but four distinct power law patterns suggestive of four regimes of slowdown of vocabulary growth. each regime corresponds to the proteomes of viruses, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. me R2 F P-value ABEV 1-Viruses 0.81 0.94 4,243 2.2E-16 2-Archaea 0.36 0.83 160 5.5E-14 3- Bacteria 0.19 0.89 259 2.2E-16 4-Eukarya 0.03 0.49 32 2.8E-6 Total 1-Viruses 0.81 0.94 3,874 2.2E-16 2-Archaea 0.37 0.88 233 3.0E-16 3-Bacteria 0.26 0.85 182 9.6E-15 4-E semantic compression is a process of compacting vocabulary with time by reducing language heterogeneity without affecting its semantics. some reflect the scaling of number of genes in different functional categories as a function of genome size. we recently built global dynamic models for evolution of structural domains that used birth-death differential equations with global abundances of domains. phylogenetic tracings support the primordial cellular origin of viruses and the gradual rise of molecular diversity in proteome evolution. remarkably large number of universal FSFs that are widespread in cellular and viral proteomes (22% of total FSFs) and harbor ancient proteins associated with cell membranes supports the ancient domain kernel. a distinction between ancient and modern cells is necessary for broader understanding of virus-early scenarios. this ancestor had many cellular ancestors that should better be referred to as \u201cancient\u201d or \u201cprimordial\u201d cells. a distinction between ancient and modern cells is necessary for broader understanding of virus-early scenarios. our evolutionary model is biphasic in nature and reconstructs an early \u201ccell-like\u201d phase in viral evolution distinguished from modern viral lineages. the cell-like phase in viral evolution can be restored when viruses take over cellular machinery and produce viral factories that resemble cell-like organelles. proteome size tracings along historical evoPCO projections and ToLs derived from a universal biology of evolutionarily conserved protein folds controvert unfounded phylogenetic attractions. this interplay holds true for simpler viruses and Archaea to more complex Bacteria and Eukarya. this makes it possible to study a multidimensional space of \u201creverse\u201d evolutionary ages of domains without losing information of FSF of very ancient origin or introducing biases from FSF absences. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
