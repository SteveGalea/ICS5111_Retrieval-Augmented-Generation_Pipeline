{"summary": "the number of imported dengue and malaria cases has gradually increased since the 1990s. the number of imported dengue and malaria cases has gradually increased since the 1990s. the total import-export value and the number of foreign tourists are increasing every year. the information included demographic characteristics, diagnosis, laboratory confirmation, onset data and diagnosis data. more detailed epidemiological data, namely region of infection acquisition, purpose of going overseas and days staying overseas, was acquired from investigation data of a part of imported cases by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). an imported case was defined as an infected person who can be traced back to an origin in an endemic area of one kind of imported acute infectious disease outside Zhejiang province within the previous month. cases of imported infectious disease which notified the CISDCP between 2011 and 2016 were screened, and those with laboratory diagnosis were excluded. the index for a given month was calculated by the average case number of that month divided by the average monthly cases during the 6 years (2011\u20132016) the seasonal indices in each month were less obvious when the seasonal indices in each month were closer to 1. dengue cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic criteria for dengue fever. positive dengue virus isolation in acute phase, 4-fold increase of dengue virus\u2013specific immunoglobulin G antibody titer in paired serum samples. chikungunya fever cases were diagnosed according to Diagnosis and treatment of Zika virus disease. 88 clinicians in 22 general hospitals and 22 community/township hospitals were invited. only department information was acquired in the questionnaire, without any other personal information. data were double-entered into Excel 2007. malaria cases took up a large proportion of imported cases. a total of 1,078 malaria cases were reported within the 6 years. proportion of P. falciparum cases showed a rising trend. the number of imported malaria cases was highest in may (86 cases) and July (83 cases), with respective seasonal indices of 1.36 and 1.32. the incidence rate of malaria was low in February, March, November, and December. the median age of the 1,078 imported malaria cases was 39. the seasonal indices of dengue were calculated by the average case number of that month divided by monthly the average monthly cases during the 6 years. most P. falciparum cases (791/822, 96.1%) were acquired from African Region, with Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea being the top three. west Pacific region and south-east Asia region were 10 (1.2%), 9 (1.1%) and 7 (0.9%) respectively. the top three countries were angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Ghana. south-east Asia region also accounted for a large proportion. 156 dengue cases were reported in Zhejiang province. median age of all imported cases was 34.5. those between 20 and 49 years of age accounted for 72.4% of all cases. chikungunya fever imported from india, angola, and the Philippines. 88 clinicians participated in our survey of diagnosis knowledge. 85 responded (response rate = 96.6%) malaria cases took up a large proportion of imported cases. the proportion of P. falciparum cases showed a rising trend. the proportion of P. ovale, P. malariae, and mixed infection increased. cases were highest in may (86 cases) and July (83 cases), with the seasonal index of 1.35. the incidence rate of malaria was low in February, March, November, and December. median age of the 1,078 imported malaria cases was 39. jiang province, china, 2011\u20132016 Malaria Dengue N % N % Sex 1,078 156 Male 969 89.9 99 63.5 Female 109 10.1 57 36.5 Age 1,078 156 20 20 1.9 15 9.6 20 243 22.5 38

vivax cases from the Eastern Mediterranean region and western Pacific region was 28 and 25 respectively. 156 dengue cases were reported in Zhejiang province. median age of all imported cases was 34.5. those between 20 and 49 years of age accounted for 72.4% (113/156) of all cases. all of the doctors completed the questionnaire (effective rate = 100%) the percent of correct responses was 54.6% (standard deviation [SD] = 21.0%) the accuracy rate among general practitioners, clinicians from infectious disease department, and clinicians from other departments was 48.9% (SD = 19.5%), 64.4% (SD = 18.7%), and 51.0% (SD = 21.8%), respectively. about 54% of cases stayed overseas for more than half a year. those young- and middle-aged males were especially susceptible to malaria. study shows only 40% of Chinese travelers sought pretravel medical advice. most cases infected with P. falciparum were imported from africa region. most cases infected with P. vivax were imported from south-east Asia region and western Pacific region. this was consistent with the global distribution estimated by world health organization. chikungunya fever and zika cases reported by CISDCP were very rare compared with malaria and dengue fever. chikungunya fever and zika cases reported by CISDCP were very rare compared with malaria and dengue fever. the quality of the data was not immune to weaknesses of the system like underreporting and inaccuracy of data. the quality of the data was not immune to weaknesses like underreporting and inaccuracy of data. there was a rising trend in imported acute infectious disease cases in Zhejiang province between 2011 and 2016. the globalization of disease should also be monitored closely. other imported acute infectious diseases such as yellow fever, MERS, Ebola virus disease and Lassa fever should also be monitored."}
