{"summary": "the incidence of the destructive repair in the Anti-VEGF Group (1/8), Src-Inhibition Group (2/8) and Supplement & Inhibition Group (2/8) was all lower than that in the Control Group (5/8), whereas it was higher in the VEGF-Supplement Group (7/8) when compared to the Control Group, the difference was not statistically significant. the incidence of the destructive repair in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group was all lower than that in the Control Group. it was higher in the VEGF-Supplement Group when compared to the Control Group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks Post-administration. time course changes in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived vascular function indices in different groups. the Ps (vascularization index) in the VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group increased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks. hibition Group and Ant-VEGF Group decreased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. it increased continuously from Baseline in VEGF-Supplement Group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. the anti-VEGF Group showed only dilated and large-sized VLS, but neither small-sized VLS nor medium-sized DLPLS. in the VEGF-Supplement Group, there are more small-sized VLS, but there are also more medium-sized DLPLS compared to the control. figure 5 presents histomorphometry of marrow circulation at 0, 2 4 weeks post administration. micro-vessel density (MVD), edema area (EA) and leakage particle size distribution decreased continuously and significantly. expression of phosphorylated Src and total Src in Bone Marrow was decreased continuously and significantly from the baseline with similar changing pattern after administration. the total Src expression level remained stable from baseline to 4 weeks post administration, and did not show difference among groups. the incidence of the destructive repair in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group was all significantly lower than that in the Control Group. there are even 1 and 3 rabbits showed dominant reparative osteogenesis in the Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group respectively. compared to that at Baseline, less large-sized and more small-sized trabecular bones were found in Control Group and VEGF-Supplement Group. more large-sized and less small-sized trabecular bone were found in Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group. the size distribution of the trabeculae shifted toward thinning in the Control Group when compared to the baseline. VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group increased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. the Ps (vascularization index) in the VEGF-Supplement Group and Ant-VEGF Group decreased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. the PS in the Src-Inhibition Group, Supplement & Inhibition Group and Ant-VEGF Group decreased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. it increased continuously from Baseline in VEGF-Supplement Group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration. hibition Group has more small-sized VLS with nearly no medium-sized DLPLS compared to Control Group. angiographic analyses of the size and thickness of the vessel structures in the bilateral proximal femora of rabbits. the control group showed neither a continuous increase in small-sized VLS nor a continuous decrease in DLPLS when compared with the baseline. leakage particles were less found in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group. there were a lot of leakage particles in the VEGF-Supplement Group. the total Src expression level remained stable from baseline to 4 weeks post administration. marrow phosphorylated Src and total Src expression at baseline and in each treatment group at 2 and 4 weeks post-intravenous injection. one-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. anti-VEGF inhibited destructive repair after osteonecrotic lesion formation. VEGF promoted destructive repair as evidenced by 100% incidence of destructive repair and moderately left shifted size distribution curve of trabecular thickness in VEGF-Supplement Group. PP1 is a cell-permeable pyrazolopyrimidine compound that inhibits Src activity with IC50 of 170 nM33. this time, we used a Src inhibitor PP1 to modulate the phosphorylated Src expression level. this time, we examined the skeletal impact of the intervention. new-zealand rabbits with body weight of 4 5 kg were housed at the Animal house in institute for Advancing Translational Medicine in Bone & Joint Diseases in Hong Kong Baptist University. all experimental protocols were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and the surgical operation was offcially approved by Hong Kong government. the selected rabbits were systemically administrated by intravenous injection with either anti-VEGF antibody (recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF at 33 mg/kg/two weeks, Anti-VEGF Group, n = 23) or VEGF (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks, VEGF-Supplement Group, n = 23) or Src inhibitor (PP1, selective inhibitor of Src activity with IC rabbits were anesthetized with 2.5% sodium pentobarbital (0.4 ml/kg) and placed in the prone position with lower limbs flexed for MRI scanning using a 1.5-T superconducting system. a bolus of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.3 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly injected by an automatic pump linked to a previously placed 21- tic lesion in bilateral proximal femoral samples was quantified by micro-CT. the decalcified proximal femur was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 m thickness along the coronal plane. a color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image. proximal parts of bilateral decalcified femoral samples were taken for intraosseous 3-D micro-angiography using our established protocol24,25. a color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image to produce a visual representation of the size distribution of angiographic structures24,39,41. the marrow edema zone was automatically traced by thresholding using ImageJ 1.32j24. the total area of the edema zone per total examined optical field area was calculated accordingly. for each leakage particle, the outline was manually traced to quantify its area and perimeter using imageJ 1.32j. the membrane was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, USA) using a TRANS-BLOT SD Semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) after blocking with 5% defatted milk for 0.5 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody, i.e., anti-Src at 1:500 (Biosource International, USA) and -actin (as an internal control) at 1:2000 overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody rabbits with body weight of 4 5 kg were housed at the Animal house in institute for Advancing Translational Medicine in Bone & Joint Diseases in Hong Kong Baptist University. all experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Institute for Advancing Translational Medicine in Bone & Joint Diseases in Hong Kong Baptist University. the surgical operation was offcially approved by Hong Kong government. injection with either anti-VEGF antibody (recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks, Anti-VEGF Group, n = 23) or Src inhibitor (PP1, selective inhibitor of Src activity with IC50 of 170 nM, 0.3 mg/kg/two weeks) or a combination of VEGF and Src inhibitor (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks) rabbits were anesthetized with 2.5% sodium pentobarbital (0.4 ml/kg) and placed in the prone position with lower limbs flexed for MRI scanning using a 1.5-T superconducting system. a bolus of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.3 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly injected by an automatic pump linked to a previously placed 21- decalcified proximal femur was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 m thickness along the coronal plane to classify the osteonecrotic lesion repair process. a color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image to produce a visual representation of the size distribution of trabecular bone. proximal parts of bilateral decalcified femoral samples were taken for intraosseous 3-D micro-angiography using our established protocol24,25. a color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image to produce a visual representation of the size distribution of angiographic structures24,39,41. the total area of the edema zone per total examined optical field area was calculated accordingly. for each leakage particle, the outline was manually traced to quantify its area and perimeter using ImageJ 1.32j. trans-BLOT SD Semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) after blocking with 5% defatted milk for 0.5 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody, i.e., anti-Src at 1:500 (Biosource International, USA) and -actin (as an internal control) at 1:2000 overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody (anti-goat IgG at 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated to horserad Y.X.H., J.L., B.S.G., D.F.L. and T.T. conducted the experiment.
