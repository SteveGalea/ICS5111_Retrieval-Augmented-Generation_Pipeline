{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for 66,000\u2013199,000 deaths per year globally. it causes a major burden of severe lower respiratory tract disease in children under 5yrs of age with an estimated 3,000,000 hospital episodes annually in all countries. the age distribution of childhood severe disease is highly skewed towards young infants (6m) around 50% of all RSV associated hospitalisations in this age group are attributed to small airway blockage. early vaccine development, focused on this vulnerable group resulted in disaster when a formalin-inactivated preparation administered to nave children led to exacerbated pneumonia and mortality upon natural RSV challenge. there are clear direct benefits to be gained from vaccinating older children. the main emphasis remains the prevention of disease in early infancy. vaccinating older infants would have to accrue from indirect protection. the demographic structure subdivides the population into 99 age classes. individuals older than 77 years have been put into the final age class. the selection of monthly age groups up to 2 years of age is chosen. individuals are born with temporary but solid maternal immunity (M) the initial conditions for the state variables for each age class were taken to be the pre-vaccination numbers found by running the model for a period of 50 years to its stable limit cycle. this ensures the transient population and infection dynamics effects are minimized during model fitting and vaccination. the set of ODE\u2019s was solved numerically in Matlab\u00ae [25] using an adaptive time step. P M is the number of M sub-classes such that P M: 1,2,...,P. The rate of ageing from age class is. the index represents the age class i.e. = 1,2,...,p. we consider a single efficacy parameter, coverage, which includes both the proportion vaccinated and the proportion protected by vaccination. we run the model with a time invariant force of infection whose value is fixed at the pre-vaccination equilibrium. the synthetic WAIFW matrix shows the mean number of contacts per day by participants (Y axis) by age group from a contact diary study in coastal Kenya. the fitted combination of three separate matrices for household structure, school attendance and homogeneous mixing plotted as the logarithm per person rate of contact. the hospitalization data was obtained from Kilifi District Hospital (KDH) we calculate the expected incidence of hospitalisations from infections in two stages. the age-specific and infection-specific risk of disease given infection (d 0,a,d 1,a,d 2,a), see Table B in S1 File. the model was fitted using statistical maximum-likelihood estimation assuming that the age and time counts follow a Poisson distribution. sian of the log-likelihood estimates given the observed data to generate an asymptotic covariance matrix. the 95% confidence interval was taken as the region between the 97.5th and the 2.5th percentiles. the model output of interest is the proportion of RSV hospitalisations averted based on the long-term post-vaccination equilibrium. the data was analyzed anonymously to generate a who Acquires Infection From Whom (WAIFW) matrix. the demographic structure subdivides the population into 99 age classes. individuals older than 77 years have been put into the final age class. the rates, with respect to both time and age at which individuals flow from one epidemiological state to another are described in the system of ODE shown in Eqn A in S1 File. the per capita rate of infection experienced by individuals in age class a at time t is given by a(t) k Factor reducing infectiousness of I 1 and I 2 1 = 0.5 2 = 0.25 Population size 240,000 KHDSS** * Age-related death rate Mid-year 2011 estimates from KHDSS** data * Rate of ageing 024m = 12/yr 377yrs = 1/yr Reciprocal of the length of the age class. n = 99. P M is the number of M sub-classes such that P M: 1,2,...,P. the rate of ageing from age class is k = 0,1,2. this assumption corresponds to the situation for a highly attenuated live virus vaccine. estimated WAIFW matrices and fits to hospitalisation data by age and time. ij = q ij where q is a disease specific infectivity parameter. model was fitted to RSV specific monthly admissions to KDH. the data used are the temporal and age-specific hospitalizations from Oct 2004 to Dec 2010. the risks of disease following infection are taken from a longitudinal cohort study of RSV infection in Kilifi, Kenya. the initial vector was estimated from longitudinal data of RSV infections. k(a,t) is the expected incidence of hospitalizations at age a and time t. the negative log-likelihood was used as the objective function of fmincon. to calculate the 95% confidence interval of the fitted parameters, we generated subsets, by both time and age, of data from the original set by sampling with replacement. the data was analyzed anonymously to generate a who Acquires Infection From Whom (WAIFW) matrix. results Fig 2 shows the two WAIFW matrices obtained from the contact diary data (A) and the synthetic contact matrix (B), respectively. 7.08 and 25.60 respectively calculated as dominant Eigen values of the WAIFW matrices. age groups within the mixing matrices do not match those in the data. Fig 3 shows the proportion of hospitalisations prevented, for different combinations of coverage (proportion immunised) and age of immunisation. the diary model predicts a honeymoon period of approximately 6 years before equilibrating to yearly epidemics with an alternating pattern of low and high peaks. on the other hand, the synthetic model does not predict a change in the pattern except that the epidemic peaks are reduced. Fig 5A shows the proportion of RSV hospital cases averted at 70% coverage at different ages. the bars show the range excluding the highest and lowest 2.5%, and the line the median. this results should not be interpreted as a probability distribution. analysis of a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of RSV using data from a low-income country setting. results are indistinguishable in terms of model fit and broadly consistent results in terms of the impact of immunisation. the results differ in a number of respects. the WAIFW matrix derived from contact diaries predicts an initial dramatic decline in cases as virus circulation is almost stopped for the first few epidemic seasons. as with other infections, this results in a build-up of susceptibles and a subsequent rebound of epidemics [35]. the diary matrix model is unable to persist on secondary and tertiary infections alone. the synthetic matrix model does not require primary infections to persist. this yields very different estimates for the basic reproduction numbers. recent individual-based models including explicit household and school-based transmission come to a similar conclusion to our own. no model has yet suggested that immunisation against RSV would not be beneficial. vaccine modelled here only protects against primary infection. this is the most likely scenario for LAV since boosting of titres is absent in seropositives. a vaccine that reduces infectiousness of secondary and subsequent infections would have no less impact. this would be the situation for a highly attenuated live virus vaccine that would not boost antibody in seropositive susceptibles."}
