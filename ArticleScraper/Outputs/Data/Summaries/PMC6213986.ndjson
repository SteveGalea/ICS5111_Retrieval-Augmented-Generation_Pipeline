{"summary": "the global prevalence for HSV-1 in people aged 0\u201349 years was 3.7 billion (roughly 67%) in 2012 [2]. HSV-1 mainly infects skin, lip mucosa, eyes, nervous system, and occasionally the external genitals. the activation of pGSK3 caused by HSV-1 infection was essential for the phosphorylation of APP at Thr 668. HSV-1 infection reduced the expression of synapsin-1 and synaptophysin, and depressed synaptic transmission. it is meaningful to search for different therapeutic strategies and drugs to suppress HSV-1, especially to prevent the reactivation of latent HSV-1. the current antiviral drugs can be divided into the following categories based on their mechanisms of action. the main therapeutic drugs frequently used in clinical practice are nucleoside analogues represented by ACV. mutagenicity of some nucleoside analogues is high, such as ganciclovir. HSV-1 mainly infects skin, lip mucosa, eyes, nervous system, and occasionally the external genitals. it can cause a variety of diseases, such as herpes labialis, herpes keratitis, and encephalitis neonatorum, etc. pathogenic \"fire\" derived from stagnation of liver-Qi is a stress-induced physiological response involving the central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system [22]. these changes increase one\u2019s susceptibility to disease. persistent emotional stress is an important factor for physical and mental fatigue as well as a weakened immunity system. the main therapeutic drugs frequently used in clinical practice are nucleoside analogues represented by ACV, which affects the virus mainly by affecting the DNA replication process. the virus is likely to develop into drug-resistant strains with long term use. the vaccine is not effective against genital herpes, let alone other HSV infections. active substances against HSV-1 extracted from plants, microorganisms, and animals have attracted widespread interest in the past few decades. the scientific and theoretical values of TCM are increasingly recognized and accepted, since TCM is one of the main sources of natural products.

APS (33) promots immunological function by increasing expression of TNF- (tumor necrosis factor-), IL-6 (interleukin-6), TLR3 (toll-like TCM exerts antiviral effects by inhibiting HSV-1 replication or inactivation of HSV-1 in the process of viral attachment/absorption/penetration. NN-B-5 interrupts the formation of TIF/C1/Oct-1/GARAT multiprotein/DNA complexes, resulting in reduced expression of ICP0 and ICP4. the level of IRF7 rose consistently and dramatically during HSV-1 infection after the treatment of Dpo (32) however, Dpo (32) failed to restrict HSV-1 replication in IRF3 or IRF7 deficient macrophages. this further suggested that Dpo (32) activated the immunity to resist the virus by up-regulating ISGs and inflammatory genes. autophagy plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. it also participates in many crucial physiological processes, such as elimination of exogenous microorganisms, antigen presentation, and inherent immune response. autophagy may resist HSV-1 infection by presenting its antigen on major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) autophagy played a double-edged role in the process of HSV-1 infection. further research of TCM with anti-HSV-1 activities based on autophagy machinery will still be needed. the penetration of HSV-1 into the cell membrane was prohibited. no viral capsid protein (vp5) synthesis was observed in HSV-1 infected cells following the treatment of 10 M notoginsenoside ST-4 (21) at 2 h post-infection. many theories exist to explain the antiviral mechanism of emodin (22). 1246TGG directly inactivates the virus at an early stage of infection, leading to the blockage of viral attachment and penetration. RNA synthesis of IE (UL54) gene was not inhibited by1246TGG. asprellanoside A (38) and oblonganoside H (39) show anti-HSV-1 activity. ursolic acid and apigenin can be used as potential clinical drugs in the treatment of ACV-resistant patients. innate immunity plays an important role in the antiviral process. clinical studies have demonstrated that TCM greatly improved the immunity of HIV positive AIDS patients and alleviated the side effects. if the anti-HSV-1 mechanism relates to the enhancement of immunity is a question to be answered. the regulation of autophagy also links to the anti-HSV-1 effect. mTOR and its downstream target, p70S6K, were evaluated in HSV-1 infected SIRC cells and in the LFE pretreated groups. most of the current anti-HSV-1 therapies are initiated only after the appearance of symptoms, and HSV-1 will become drug-resistant after long-term application of a certain kind of chemical drugs. some viruses can enhance autophagy or exploit autophagy for replication and pathogenesis. emodin (22) may play an antiviral role by inhibiting casein kinase2 (CK2), which in turn phosphorylate a lot of viral proteins. emodin (22) could specifically inhibit UL12, an HSV-1 protein involved in DNA processing and capsid egression. 1246TGG suppressed viral growth mainly within 3 h post-infection. 1246TGG suppressed viral growth mainly within 3\u20136 h post-infection for ACV. data indicated that the replication of HSV-1 DNA was dramatically reduced. a report by Pengcuo et al. uncovered that alantolactone (34) at a concentration of 107 g/mL inhibited viral infection remarkably. compounds extracted from the roots of Ilex asprella exhibited interesting anti-HSV-1 activity. the mechanism of these compounds against HSV-1 has not been clarified. preliminary experimental data have shown that these compounds have the potential to be developed as anti-HSV-1 drugs. the research on TCM against HSV-1 is conducted in vitro or in mouse models. fected with HSV-1 to prevent the recurrence of latent HSV-1 should be encouraged. the study focused on direct antiviral activity at different stages of virus infection. however, these mechanisms were not enough to reflect the holistic view of TCM. the relationship between autophagy and HSV-1 is in a dynamic equilibrium state. on the one hand, autophagy was beneficial for the removal of HSV-1. TBK1 promoted autophagy by phosphorylating autophagy receptor protein P62. synthesis should be developed to produce enough bioactive agents to meet the needs of clinical researches. mutated HSV-1 strains produced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system could be potential vaccines in full swing for the prevention of HSV-1 in humans [91,92]"}{"summary": "the global prevalence for HSV-1 in people aged 0\u201349 years was 3.7 billion (roughly 67%) in 2012 [2].
