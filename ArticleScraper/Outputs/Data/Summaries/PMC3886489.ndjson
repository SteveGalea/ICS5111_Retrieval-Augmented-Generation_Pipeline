{"summary": "the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) is of particular interest. its characteristic features are wide geographical distribution and high pathogenicity to humans. there is a constant threat of a pandemic due to the constant evolution of influenza viruses. most studies are devoted to the investigation of morphological manifestations of HPAI H5N1 in the lungs. but the liver being the central organ of detoxification and immunity is an important barrier to the spread of viruses in the organism. inflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IL-8, IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGF) cytokines. mice were taken out of the experiment through the dislocation of the cervical spine vertebrae under ether narcosis. mice were intranasally infected with 10 MLD50 of A/H5N1. experimental works with studied HPAI H5N1 virus have been performed. immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed by using indirect streptavidin-peroxidase method. sections were dewaxed and rehydrated after antigen unmasking in microwave oven. results and discussion In experimental infection of mice with influenza virus A/H5N1 A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 we observed a high mortality rate of 75%. death of animals was registered in 7\u201311 days after infection. at the histological examination of the liver of infected animals in the first six days, we registered expansion and congestion of major veins and sinusoids. from the first day after infection, we observed hepatocytes in a state of dystrophy, necrosis. volume density of destructive changes of hepatocytes on day 6 postinfection was the largest and amounted to 93.78%. production of lysozyme, cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase was investigated. lysozyme-secretory activity was detected in endothelial cells. lysozyme-secretory activity was detected in endothelial cells. eloperoxidase in the liver of mice infected with influenza virus reached a maximum on day 3 of the disease. eloperoxidase oxidizes cofactors, translating them into an active form, thus providing a powerful microbicidal effect. resulting strong oxidants cause tissue damage of the organism. inflammatory cytokines facilitate the initiation of degradation processes. a/H5N1 virus infection of mice was accompanied by early activation of expression of myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, and cathepsin D by Kupffer cells."}
