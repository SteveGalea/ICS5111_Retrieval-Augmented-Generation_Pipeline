{"summary": "in 1985, phage display technology displayed foreign peptides on the virion surface by inserting the foreign DNA fragments into the filamentous phage gene III. it was demonstrated that foreign peptides in fusion proteins on the virion surface were in immunologically accessible form. phage display technology has been widely used in basic research such as studying the sites and the networks of protein-protein interactions [6,7,8,9] the target refers to the substance used to screen the phage library. the template refers the natural partner binding to the target. the whole process of affinity selection is usually called biopanning or just panning. mimotopes obtained from phage display experiments are very valuable. peptides are candidates for new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. peptides are candidates for new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. the ASPD database contains panning results from random libraries, mutant libraries and cDNA libraries. at present, the database contains data on 195 selection experiments. for each experiment, a full reference, a link to the MEDLINE database are recorded. peptides obtained from the public domain and by competitive screening of phage display libraries using antisera raised against allergens and industrial enzymes are not included. peptides with sequences longer than 40 residues or selected from phage display cDNA libraries are not included. there are five solved structures for target-mimotope complex, which are related to four mimotope sets. for structures of target-template or target-mimotope complex, contact residues making the interface can be viewed interactively with JmolApplet. phage display technology has shown its power in exploring the interactions between proteins, peptides and small molecule ligands. phage display technology has shown its power in exploring the interactions between proteins, peptides and small molecule ligands. -accessible web server [33] MIMOP Available upon request Includes MimAlign and MimCons [34] EPIMAP Not stated Improved version of FINDMAP [35] Pepitope http://pepitope.tau.ac.il Server for Mapitope and PepSurf [37] Perschinka Available upon request Only tool coded with MATLAB [38] Pep-3D-Search http://kyc.nenu.edu. patch-based methods (such as SiteLight and EpiSearch) and graph-based methods (such as Pep-3D-Search and Pepsurf) the most frequently used targets are proteins, especially antibodies. phage display technology was used for epitope mapping from its infancy. the 3-dimensional coarse-grained epitope search was based on the X-ray structure of Bet v 1. each amino acid in the structure was localized using the coordinates of its C atom. each amino acid in the structure was localized using the coordinates of its C grid. the mapitope algorithm was originally proposed by Enshell-Seijffers et al. [30]. each peptide is converted to overlapping sequence pairs. each peptide is then pooled and the frequency of each type is calculated. et al. added a filling step to improve the performance of Mapitope. the new dataset is then compared to the total amino acid pair composition of the mimotopes. the largest clusters are predicted to be the epitope. a large set of mimotopes is collected through panning against specific monoclonal antibodies. mimotopes selected using patient antiserum are interrogated for the presence of epitope specific pairs. in 2005, the tool 3DEX (short for 3D-Epitope-Explorer) was developed by Schreiber et al. a web tool for mimotope-based epitope mapping was coded with Perl. in the first section, it provides a simple interface for ClustalW to align a set of mimotopes. in the second section, MIMOX can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence, or part of them, onto the corresponding antigen structure. pepsurf is a graph-based tool for mapping a set of mimotopes onto the template surface. the best match of each mimotope is found by aligning it against virtually all possible paths in the graph. a clustering step then combines the most significant matches and a predicted epitope is inferred. the algorithm first divides the surface of template into overlapping surface patches around each solvent accessible amino acid residue with a radius of 12. it ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in each mimotope and in each patch. AAFREQ, POPDIV, AADIV, INFO and DIVAA are designed to analyze the statistical properties of a peptide population. if the structure of the template is not available, MATCH, FASTAcon and FASTAskan can be used to do optimal sequence alignments between mimotopes and its template sequence. each position POPDIV https://relic.bio.anl.gov/popdiv.aspx Population diversity of mimotopes AADIV https://relic.bio.anl.gov/aafreqs3.aspx Likelihood of random occurrence DIVAA https://relic.bio.anl.gov/divaa.aspx Sequence diversities and relationships MOTIF1 https://relic.bio.anl.gov/motif1. peptide population of both affinity-selected library and unselected library can be identified and theoretically subtracted from the affinity-selected library. peptide population of both affinity-selected library and unselected library can be identified and theoretically subtracted from the affinity-selected library. one motif indicates propagation-related TUPs. 22 motifs indicate selection-related TUPs. a lot of target-unrelated peptides bearing no known motifs are embedded in SAROTUP. phage display technology was used for epitope mapping from its infancy. a program called PEPTIDE is used to create a file in PIR format. the commercial package such as GCG is used to search the PIR file with the consensus sequence obtained from mimotopes. the model was further simplified by classifying all amino acids into four groups: polar, lipophilic, acidic and basic amino acids. a branch-and-bound algorithm was used to solve this alignment problem in practice and implemented with C++. the mapitope algorithm was originally proposed by Enshell-Seijffers et al. [30]. the algorithm seeks the match pairs on the template surface and attempts to link them into clusters. the improved method was applied to the prediction of epitopes for five monoclonal antibodies against the west Nile virus E protein. in the case of E16 monoclonal antibody, only three contact residues were uncovered by the original algorithm. additional nine contact residues were found by the improved algorithm. mimotopes selected using patient antiserum are interrogated for the presence of the epitope specific pairs. the tool 3DEX maps each amino acid in the mimotope into a table. residues in each table are then connected one by one if their C or C distances below the predefined threshold. each mimotope is divided into a set of overlapping 5-mer peptides. these peptides are then superimposed onto the template surface according to C atoms. the best match of each mimotope is found by aligning it against virtually all possible paths in the graph. the program was written in C++ and can be used directly through the Pepitope web server. the mapitope and a combination of PepSurf and Mapitope algorithm are also implemented in the Pepitope. in 2008, Huang et al. proposed another graph-based tool Pep-3D-Search. a mixture of the patch-based method and the graph-based method coded with Java. the template surface is divided into overlapping surface patches centered at the C atom of each surface residue with a 15 radius. the surface patches are converted into graphs by specifying two amino acids as neighbor amino acids using a fluctuating distance threshold guided by the compactness factor. MOTIF1 and MOTIF2 are designed to identify weak sequence motifs within short peptide sequence populations. CLOSEcon, HETEROalign and DistSim use PDB file of the template as the basis for analysis of protein-ligand interactions. anl.gov/divaa.aspx Sequence diversities and relationships MOTIF1 https://relic.bio.anl.gov/motif1.aspx Identifies continuous short motifs MOTIF2 https://relic.bio.anl.gov/motif2.aspx Finds contact residues for a small ligand HETEROalign https://relic.bio.anl.gov/hetero.aspx Aligns the method is based on the theory of information by Shannon. it is also an option in the RELIC programs HETEROalign, MATCH, and FASTAskan to reduce noise in affinity-selected peptide sequences. analysis on peptides in the mimoDB database can also reveal new TUPs. there are still a lot of problems need to be solved. phage display technology will become even more powerful."}
