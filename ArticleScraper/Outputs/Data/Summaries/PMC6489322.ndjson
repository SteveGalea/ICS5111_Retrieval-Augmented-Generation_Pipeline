{"summary": "the picornaviral 3C protease mediates viral polyprotein maturation and multiple cleavages of host proteins. the 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses. the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. based kinetic analysis was calculated, and the Vmax and Km values were 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 M, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease."}
