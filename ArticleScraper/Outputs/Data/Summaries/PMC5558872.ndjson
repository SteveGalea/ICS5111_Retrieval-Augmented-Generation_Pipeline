{"summary": "despite improvements in donor screening and laboratory testing, a small risk of viral, bacterial, or protozoal contamination remains. one solution to reduce the risk of blood transfusiontransmitted infections from platelet transfusion is photochemical pathogen reduction. pathogens are either inactivated or significantly depleted in number, thereby reducing chance of transmission. nine trials compared intercept\u00ae pathogenreduced platelets to standard platelets. one trial compared both pathogenreduced platelets types to standard platelets. eight trials included only adults. there is probably no difference between pathogenreduced platelets and standard platelets in the incidence of serious adverse events. participants who received pathogenreduced platelet transfusions had an increased risk of developing platelet refractoriness (7 trials, 1525 participants; RR 2.94, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.16; I2 = 0%; highquality evidence) there was evidence of subgroup differences in multiple transfusion trials between the two pathogenreduced platelet technologies assessed in this review (Intercept\u00ae and Mirasol\u00ae) for allcause mortality and the interval between platelet transfusions (favouring Intercept\u00ae)"}
