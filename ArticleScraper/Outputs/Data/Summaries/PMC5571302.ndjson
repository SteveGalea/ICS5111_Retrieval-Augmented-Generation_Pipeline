{"summary": "stilbenoids resveratrol (RES) and pterostilbene (PTE) function as plant phytoalexins. resveratrol is found in grape skins, small berries, peanuts, and almonds. resveratrol inhibits replication of several viruses, including herpes simplex viruses. resveratrol is an inhibitor of cellular ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis during cell proliferation and for DNA repair. treatment of cells with resveratrol reduces cellular dNTP levels, particularly those of dATP and dGTP (22) the failure of resveratrol alone to inhibit HIV-1 infection of activate in situ analyses following vaginal infection of macaques found that 80% of the initial targets of SIV infection were intraepithelial or endocervical lamina propria resting CD4+ T cells (26, 27, 29) and Th17 cells (30). resting CD4 T cells contribute substantially to viral replication and immune depletion. RESULTS Resveratrol inhibits HIV-1 infection of resting CD4 T cells. but not activated CD4 T cells or cells of the immortalized CD4 T cell line Jurkat. resveratrol inhibits single-round HIV-1 infection of. cells of the Jurkat T cell line, primary CD4 T cells activated by PHA-L and IL-2, and resting CD4 T cells treated with IL-4 were infected with the HIV-1 GFP reporter virus G1ESI (115). resveratrol was added immediately after infection. in vivo, most circulating strains utilize CCR5. we tested RES and PTE inhibition of infection of resting CD4 T cells. we then tested the anti-HIV-1 activity in resting T cells of four stilbenoids. IL-4-treated resting CD4 T cells were infected with resveratrol (RES), pterostilbene (PTE), polydatin (POLY), piceatannol (PIC) and isorhapontigenin (ISOR) Flow cytometric analysis was performed on day 5 p.i. cytokines did not influence resveratrol's HIV-1 inhibition. at the lowest dose of pterostilbene tested (1 M) there was a statistically significant decrease in efficacy in the presence of each cytokine compared with that with no cytokine. we infected resting CD4 T cells with 3 different doses of HIV-1. the ability of resveratrol and pterostilbene to inhibit infection was not altered by the dose of virus. IL-4-treated resting CD4 T cells were infected with the indicated amounts of HIV-1 (G1ESI) reduced dNTP levels are thought to allow nucleoside analog drugs to compete with endogenous nucleotides for incorporation into the nascent viral DNA during reverse transcription. we presume that the already low dNTP levels in resting T cells allowed resveratrol and pterostilbene to reduce dNTP levels below the ability of reverse transcriptase to function. both stilbenoids reduced the number of 2-LTR circles to below the detection limit of 1 copy per 1,000 cells. resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibit reverse transcription in resting CD4 T cells. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1 (G1ESI) and treated with the indicated concentrations of RES or PTE. d to remove free virus as in all experiments whose results have been presented. cell samples collected on day 3 p.i. were analyzed by qPCR for late (full-length) HIV-1 DNA. percent GFP+ cells for each treatment at day 5 p.i. was normalized against the percent GFP+ of the DMSO control. resveratrol inhibition of HIV-1 Tat-mediated transactivation of the viral promoter in transfected HeLa fibroblastic cells. dNTP levels influence viral mutation rates (66) so it is possible that resveratrol and pterostilbene increase the generation of defective genomes incapable of proper gene expression. Vpx reversed 65% and 69% of the 15 M resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibition of infection. the combination of Vpx and dN application completely reversed resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibition at all dN concentrations. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at day 5 p.i. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1 and treated with the indicated concentration of RES or PTE without dN at 30 M. data represent the means and standard deviation from three independent experiments using cells from different donors. the addition of dN restored GFP expression (Fig. 6D) and early and late transcript production in resveratrol- and pterostilbene-treated cells to at least the levels in untreated cells. intriguingly, deoxynucleosides enhanced HIV-1 expression, as measured by the number of GFP+ cells, by more than 60%. resveratrol or pterostilbene increased the dose to 15 M at the time of initial infection further decreased the subsequent expansion of the virus. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with the replication-competent GFP reporter virus NLENG1-IRES. resveratrol- or pterostilbene-treated populations were seen. resveratrol synergizes with the NRTI to inhibit HIV-1 infection. resveratrol synergizes with NRTI to inhibit HIV-1 infection. the cytosine analog FTC slightly reduced the IC50 and IC90 of resveratrol, but these reductions were not statistically significant. the addition of the thymidine analog AZT produced a small but nevertheless statistically significant increase in the normalized IC50 of resveratrol (26% increase; P = 0.014) resveratrol inhibits single-round HIV-1 infection of resting CD4 T cells. resveratrol inhibits single-round HIV-1 infection of resting CD4 T cells. resveratrol is known to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis was performed at day 2 p.i. for activated CD4 T cells and Jurkat T cells and at day 5 p.i. for resting CD4 T cells. data are representative of those from 3 independent experiments. pterostilbene (PTE) (2); polydatin (POLY), also called piceid, was as effective as resveratrol at all concentrations. none of these four stilbenoids inhibited infection of activated CD4 cells or Jurkat cells at the doses tested. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on day 5 p.i. percent inhibition was calculated by dividing the number of GFP+ cells for each treatment by the number of GFP+ cells in the DMSO control treatment. in this study, we treated the purified resting CD4 T cells with IL-4, which increases the yield of infected cells without inducing T cell activation. cytokines did not influence resveratrol's HIV-1 inhibition. at the lowest dose of pterostilbene tested (1 M) there was a statistically significant decrease in efficacy in the presence of each cytokine compared with that with no cytokine. resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription in resting CD4 T cells. the anti-HIV properties of resveratrol have been attributed to its inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and the result reduction in dNTP levels. dNTP levels in resting T cells allowed resveratrol and pterostilbene to reduce dNTP levels below the ability of reverse transcriptase to function. we measured the amount of full-length HIV-1 DNA, the amount of integrated proviral DNA, and the amount of 2-LTR circles. both stilbenoids reduced the number of 2-LTR circles by 97%. resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibit reverse transcription in resting CD4 T cells. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1 (G1ESI) and treated with the indicated concentrations of RES or PTE. percent GFP+ cells for each treatment at day 5 p.i. was normalized against the percent GFP+ of the DMSO control. each drug was ineffective at reducing HIV-1 DNA levels when it was added 2 days after infection. resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibition of HIV-1 infection in resting CD4 T cells is reversed by exogenous dN or Vpx. dNTP levels influence viral mutation rates (66) so it is possible that resveratrol and pterostilbene increase the generation of defective genomes incapable of proper gene expression. exogenous deoxynucleosides (dN) and Vpx reverse resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibition of HIV-1 infection. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1 and treated with resveratrol or pterostilbene plus the indicated dose of dN. data represent the means and standard deviations from three independent experiments using cells from different donors. cells from the assay were collected on day 3 p.i. and were analyzed by qPCR for early and late (full-length) RT transcripts. production in resveratrol- and pterostilbene-treated cells to at least the levels in untreated cells. deoxynucleosides increased HIV-1 expression by more than 60%. it is possible that addition of dN to cells reduces generation of defective genomes. resveratrol and pterostilbene were infected with the replication-competent virus NLENG1-IRES. IL-4-treated CD4 T cells were infected with the replication-competent GFP reporter virus NLENG1-IRES. the cells were washed twice on day 6 p.i. and then activated with PHA-L and IL-2. resveratrol synergizes with the NRTI to inhibit HIV-1 infection. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or other NRTIs (AZT, FTC, and abacavir [ABC]) enhance the effectiveness of resveratrol and pterostilbene. resveratrol and pterostilbene were titrated in 3-fold dilutions. the effect of each NRTI on the IC50 and IC90 of each stilbenoid is presented. abacavir (ABC) was used at 16 nM, emtricitabine (FTC) was used at 12 nM. both resveratrol and pterostilbene inhibited the generation of reverse transcripts following HIV-1 infection. this inhibition was completely reversed using exogenous deoxynucleosides and the SIV Vpx protein. resveratrol and pterostilbene target cellular pathways other than the RNR pathway. inhibition or overactivation of SIRT1 could disturb this cycle. resveratrol inhibits HIV-1 expression in a HeLa cell line. the concentrations of resveratrol and pterostilbene used to achieve half-maximum inhibition of HIV-1 integration (78) and Tat transactivation (25) were up to 10 times higher. the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has evolved to synthesize viral DNA at low dNTP levels and has a lower Km for dNTPs than the reverse transcriptase from oncoretroviruses (88). dNTP levels can be a strategy to inhibit retrovirus and DNA virus infection (50, 88) kines, chemokines, and stromal cells provide support for infection of resting T cells (36, 48, 57, 63, 65, 91) IL-4, which enhances HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissues, block HIV-1-induced apoptosis soon after infection of resting T cells (49) the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in nonproliferating host cells is vital to its successful spread from the genital mucosa to the rest of the resveratrol and pterostilbene have anti-inflammatory properties (4, 105, 106) resveratrol and pterostilbene have anti-inflammatory properties (4, 105, 106), including decreased T cell activation (74) related to SIRT1 activation (75, 107) dNTP pool for anti-HIV purposes has been previously attempted using systemic hydroxyurea (50, 108); however, hydroxyurea can potentiate the toxicity of some NRTIs, such as didanosine, and caused serious systemic adverse effects in vivo. no in vivo toxicity even at high doses has been observed in controlled studies (110\u2013112) m-pore-size filter and treated with Benzonase nuclease (25 U/ml; EMD Millipore Biosciences) to remove residual plasmid remaining from the transfections. PBMCs were purified from HIV-1-negative adults and were purchased as deidentified buffy coats. Isorhapontigenin (ISOR) and the four deoxynucleosides (dN) were from Sigma-Aldrich. all small-molecule drugs as well as dN were added immediately after spinoculation or at the time points indicated above and at the doses indicated in the figure legends. curve fit was determined using the IC50 and Hill slope factor from the curve fit in the online GraphPad calculator for effective concentration. cellular DNA extraction, early HIV reverse transcript PCR, late (full-length) HIV-RT transcript HIV PCR, 2-LTR HIV PCR, and integration Alu PCR were performed using the primers and TaqMan probes described previously (48, 57, 114). infectious viruses were generated by transfection of 293T cells with a plasmid expressing the reporter virus (G1I) or cotransfection with a plasmid expressing an env-defective reporter virus (G1ESI) with the plasmid expressing the env-defective reporter virus (G1ESI) with the plasmid expressing the env-defective reporter virus (G1ESI) with the plasmi infected cells were washed once and then plated at 40,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. the cells were incubated with the treatment compounds for 5 days. resveratrol (RES) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Flow cytometry was performed in a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) upgraded to 3 lasers and 5 color channels. percent inhibition was calculated by dividing the percentage of GFP+ cells in each treatment group by the percentage of GFP+ cells in the appropriate DMSO control. the difference between different experimental conditions was calculated using the unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed) with an alpha value of 0.05."}
