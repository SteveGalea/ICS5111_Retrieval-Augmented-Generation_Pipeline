{"summary": "Renalase is a newly discovered monoamine oxidase enzyme originating from renal tissues. it degrades circulating catecholamines, regulates blood pressure and cardiac function. it is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. anti-renalase monoclonal antibodies were used to analyze renalase expression in renal tissues and cells. renalase gene was inserted in pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) plasmid. 100 g plasmids (100 l sterile PBS, pH 7.4) was given intramuscularly in the quadriceps. stimulation parameters were square wave, 100 V/50 ms, positive and negative impulses given three times each. three weeks after the last injection, cell fusion was carried out. renal tissues subjected to testing were from a post-traumatic kidney. western blotting was carried out to detect renalase's expression in renal tissues. FITC labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG were added as secondary antibodies. transfection of renalase plasmid HEK293T cells was done using prokaryotic expression system. plasmid was purified and measured for concentration, then stored at 20\u00b0C. ten days after the cell fusion, cells were subjected to centrifugation. western blotting was carried out to detect renalase's expression in renal tissues. western blotting was carried out to detect renalase's expression. FITC labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, USA) were added as secondary antibodies. renalase was detected by anti-His Tag monoclonal antibody. culture supernatant was collected and ascites was prepared. analysis of culture supernatant showed an antibody titer of 1128000. anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was over 1512000. renalase expressed in renal glomeruli (Anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody) renalase expressed in renal proximal tubules (anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody) renalase expressed in mesangial cells (Fig. 5A), podocytes (Fig. 5C) and renal tubular epithelial cells. renal tubular epithelial cells can be detected by western blotting. anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody. only tubular epithelial cells' supernatant could be detected the expression of renalase. anti-renalase monoclonal antibody presented high sensitivity. one mouse with high titer was selected as spleen cells donor. cell fusion was done with cell line SP2/0. renalase expressed in renal glomeruli (Anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody) (400) renalase expressed in renal proximal tubules (Anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody) renalase expressed in renal glomeruli (Fig. 4A) and tubule (Fig. 4C) renalase expressed in mesangial cells (anti-renalase monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody) (400) renal tubular epithelial cells can express renalase. but only tubular epithelial cells' supernatant could be detected the expression of renalase. Renalase was discovered in 2005, it is an enzyme expressed in kidneys that can degrade circulating catecholamines. it is a highly conserved protein, of which 95% of amino acids are similar to that of primates. this is probably because renalase coded genes have evolved from a same ancestor gene. renalase gene polymorphysim is associated with primary hypertension, indicating this gene may become the novel marker of genetic susceptibility in essential hypertension [30]. renalase gene polymorphism also is associated with ventricular hypertrophy [31]. renalase levels significantly decrease in patients with stroke and chronic kidney diseases, especially those on renal replacement therapy [39]\u2013[41], and is normalized in kidney and heart transplant recipients [42], [43]. renalase was expressed in both glomeruli and renal tubule [1] es, mesangial cells, podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, but its physiological function is not clear yet. a lot more works need to be done on renalase's expression, regulation, function and replacement therapy etc."}
