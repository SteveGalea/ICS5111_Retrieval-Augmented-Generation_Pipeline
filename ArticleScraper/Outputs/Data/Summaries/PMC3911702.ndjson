{"summary": "the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 spurred new interest in HCoV over the last decade. the HCoV OC43 was isolated from patients in the 1960s who had symptoms of the common cold. OC43 also causes pneumonia in the immunocompromised. studies state SARS-CoV N activates NF-B (14, 15), and one that states N inhibits NF-B activation (16). NF-B is a multifunctional transcription factor that is prominent in the innate immune response to virus infection. p50 homodimers have been found to be transcriptionally active when complexed with atypical IB proteins, such as IB and BCL-3. p50 subunit can also form dimers with p65 and transcriptional coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (24) 293T cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 8% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. all cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO2 incubator. the resulting virus genome was amplified in 293T cells. the amplified genes were FLAG tagged and subcloned into expression vector pEF. luciferase plasmid luc-NFKB1 was a kind gift from Massimo Locati. all plasmids were prepared with endotoxin-free kits (Qiagen) antibodies against FLAG were obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. cells were treated 24 h posttransfection with NF-B-luc and -Gal plasmid. cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmid NF-B-luc. cells were lysed at 1, 2, and 3 days postinfection and assayed for luciferase activity. all cells were lysed in FLAG-IP lysis buffer with protease inhibitor. resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with washed resin preconjugated with monoclonal FLAG antibody. precipitated proteins were eluted by competitive binding. 293T cells were either infected with N-FLAG (N-FL) VSV or GFP VSV. cells were lysed in FLAG-IP lysis buffer with protease inhibitor (Roche) the same immunoprecipitation procedure previously described using the commercial FLAG immunoprecipitation kit was followed. all cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator. OC43 nucleocapsid protein (N-FLAG) was subcloned into the 51 VSV genome between the G and L genes. the amplified genes were FLAG tagged and subcloned into expression vector pEF via XhoI and BglII restriction sites. plasmids containing -galactosidase (-Gal) and NF-B-luc were kind gifts from Karen Mossman. 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1.3 105 cells per well. cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid NF-B-luc, -Gal plasmid, and coronaviral N gene. 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1.3 105 cells per well. hek293 cells were plated at a density of 5 104 in 24-well plates. cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, NFKB1-luc, OC43 N. eluate was run on precast SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Invitrogen) using the Novex midi-gel system (Invitrogen) gels were stained for protein using Coomassie blue silver stain. for RNase treatment, cell lysates were treated with RNase H (Thermo Scientific) or mock treated at 37\u00b0C. qPCR was performed with commercial primers for miR-9 (SABiociences) and RT2 SYBR green qPCR master mix (SABiosciences) 293T cells were transfected with N-FLAG or pCDNA. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TNF- for 6 h. NF-B activation is potentiated in the presence of OC43 N upon stimulation. cells were stimulated with TNF- for 24 h prior to measurement. all luciferase measurements were normalized to -galactosidase. inclusion of the N protein expression plasmid led to a greater-than-10-fold enhancement in the NF-B response to stimulation. this signified that the phenomenon of potentiated NF-B activation in the presence of OC43 N occurs via multiple pathways. therefore, the p65 subunit of NF-B was examined for prolonged activation in the presence of OC43 N, which would point toward the malfunction of a p65-negative regulator. a vesicular stomatitis virus was generated expressing a FLAG-tagged N gene. a large number of cells were infected with this virus, designated N-FLAG VSV. subsequent lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against FLAG. OC43 N interacts with many cellular proteins in an RNA-dependent manner. lysates of N-FL VSV-infected cells were treated with RNase or left untreated prior to FLAG immunoprecipitation. OC43 N binds to miR-9, a negative inhibitor of NF-B. hsa\u2013miR-9 (B1) is over 3-fold higher in N-FLAG cells than in pCDNA. miR-9 targets NFKB1, which encodes the p105 and p50 subunits of NF-B. we postulated that N could be functionally hindering the negative regulation of NFKB1 by interacting with miR-9. p105 and p50 subunits were detected, quantified, and compared. the total protein levels of NFKB1 were consistently higher in cells expressing N compared to empty vector. values were normalized to -actin. NFKB1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR in cells transfected with OC43 N. all NFKB1 values were normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH. transfected 293T cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and NFKB1. if N disrupted the regulation, it would be expected that an increase in NFKB1 mRNA could be observed. stimulation of the pathway with TNF-, for example, would result in elevated transcription of NFKB1 and with the addition of N, a further amplification of NFKB1 mRNA would be observed. expression levels of endogenous miR-9 in 293T cells are low. OC43 N prevents negative regulation of NFKB1. luciferase construct was cotransfected with either empty vector pSG5 or N-FLAG. mmunoprecipitation (whole-cell lysate and eluted protein, respectively), with N protein levels showing a marked increase from 8 hpi to 20 hpi. each sample was amplified in triplicates; each sample was amplified in triplicate. cells were costained with antibodies against NFKB1 and OC43 N protein. fluorescence intensity of NFKB1 was significantly higher in infected cells. at 1, 2, and 3 days postinfection, activation of NF-B was higher in OC43-infected cells than in mock-infected cells. NF-B activation is potentiated in the presence of OC43 N upon stimulation. cells were stimulated with TNF- for 24 h prior to measurement. all luciferase measurements were normalized to -galactosidase. p65 subunit of NF-B was examined for prolonged activation in the presence of OC43 N. this would point toward the malfunction of a p65-negative regulator. p65 nuclear localization, an indicator of activation, did not appear to endure longer in 293T cells expressing N after TNF- stimulation, indicating that prolonged activation of this subunit was not responsible for the potentiation of NF-B activation. a vesicular stomatitis virus was generated expressing a FLAG-tagged N gene. a large number of cells were infected with this virus, designated N-FLAG VSV. subsequent lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against FLAG. lysates were treated with RNase prior to immunoprecipitation. interactions with several cellular proteins were eliminated with RNase treatment. OC43 N binds to miR-9, a negative inhibitor of NF-B. miR-9 targets NFKB1, which encodes the p105 and p50 subunits of NF-B. miR-9 was detected by PCR in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing N but not the control plasmid. hsa\u2013miR-9 (B1) is over 3-fold higher in N-FLAG cells than in pCDNA. 293T cells transfected with N or empty vector were stimulated with TNF- and lysed at various times poststimulation. both p105 and p50 subunits were detected, quantified, and compared between samples. the total protein levels of NFKB1 were consistently higher in cells expressing N compared to empty vector. NFKB1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR in cells transfected with pCDNA. all NFKB1 values were normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH. transfected 293T cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and NFKB1. if N disrupted the regulation, it would be expected that an increase in NFKB1 mRNA could be observed. stimulation of the pathway with TNF- would result in elevated transcription of NFKB1. mRNA levels of NFKB1 were investigated by qPCR in transfected cells. expression of N protein blocked the ability of the included exogenous miR-9 to suppress luciferase levels. expression levels of endogenous miR-9 in 293T cells are low. OC43 N prevents miR-9 negative regulation of NFKB1. HCT-8 cells infected with OC43 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against N. miR-9 is expressed as fold change relative to mock-infected cells. each sample was amplified in triplicates. cells were costained with antibodies against NFKB1 and OC43 N protein. the mean fluorescence intensity of NFKB1 was significantly higher in infected cells than in mock-infected cells. at 1, 2, and 3 days postinfection, activation of NF-B was higher in OC43-infected cells. OC43 N protein expression significantly potentiates NF-B activation by the nucleocapsid (14, 15) no mechanisms of interference were proposed in these reports. miRNAs were upregulated with OC43 N expression and TNF- treatment. miR-9 expression is inducible by TNF- as well as by the TLR2 signaling pathways. luciferase assay confirmed that N was functionally interfering with miR-9 function. the level of miR-9 detected at 20 hpi was lower than at 8 hpi. this is juxtaposed with the level of N protein expression as detected by Western blot analysis. we speculate that N interacts more strongly with the viral genome. OC43 N binds miR-9, which is basally expressed, and prevents its control of NFKB1 mRNA. with a stimulus such as TNF-, both miR-9 and NFKB1 mRNA increase. OC43 N continues to bind miR-9, preventing inhibition of NFKB1 translation. as OC43 does not manifest in fatal infections, it is feasible that this is the key difference between OC43 and its fellow betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV. the latter causes immense levels of inflammation in the lungs of patients that does not resolve, resulting in high mortality. we also recognize that N is binding other miRNAs and mRNAs. a viral RNA-binding protein is able to bind cellular RNA (40, 41) miRNAs are an extremely important subset of cellular RNAs and have been the focus of a large volume of research since their discovery in the early 1990s (42). many groups have shown antiviral effects of miRNAs as well as viral manipulations of the miRNA pathways."}
