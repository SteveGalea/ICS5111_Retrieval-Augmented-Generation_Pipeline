{"summary": "proximal urethral stricture was diagnosed by retrograde urethrogram in a 2-year-old neutered cat. the cat was referred following a 2-month history of stranguria, pollakiuria and urinary incontinence. fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation was performed. the cat did not show any recurrence of clinical signs. domestic shorthair cat was presented with a 5-week history of stranguria, pollakiuria and urinary incontinence. the cat was reported to be excessively licking her vulva. this progressed to urinary incontinence when laying down and stranguria when urinating. abdominal ultrasonography showed a focal thickening of the mid dorsal bladder wall. Mild right renal pelvic dilation and diverticuli were noted without ureteral dilation. cystoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia. cat was admitted for fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation of the urethral stricture. a 9.5 Fr cystoscope (67030 BA; Karl Storz-Endoskope) was introduced into the distal urethra. the stricture was identified as a membranous structure arising from the urethral mucosa. a retrograde urethrogram showed a marked improvement in the diameter of the proximal urethra at the site of the previous stricture. a retrograde urethrogram showed a marked improvement in the diameter of the proximal urethra. stricture formation was considered congenital in origin based on signalment and lack of trauma, urethral catheterisation or surgical intervention prior to presentation. despite the lack of histopathology, it was considered to be a membrane based on the correlation of its clinical appearance. complications associated with cystoscopy include trauma to the urethral wall, urethritis, urethral and/or bladder rupture. a single case report of a urethral stricture as a consequence of perineal urethrostomy surgery in a cat was managed via bougienage. limited cases of non-malignant urethral strictures have been reported in dogs2,7,31,32 and cats. only two of the canine cases reported were managed by fluoroscopy- and cystoscopy-guided balloon dilation. load are required to fully endorse this technique in cats."}
