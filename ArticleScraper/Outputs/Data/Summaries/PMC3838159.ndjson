{"summary": "apoptosis is a critical host response to viral infection. induction of apoptotic cell death limits production of viral progeny from infected cells. apoptosis also causes the pathology associated with many viral diseases. protein 1s is a 14-kDa nonstructural protein encoded by the viral S1 gene segment (16, 24, 25) it is not known how attachment protein 1 or nonstructural protein 1s contributes to reovirus apoptosis. it is not known how attachment protein 1s or nonstructural protein 1s contributes to intrinsic apoptotic pathways. T3C84-MA harbors a second mutation in the S1 gene that confers binding of 1 to cell surface sialic acid (33). the capacity to bind sialic acid enhances reovirus-induced apoptosis (34) and virulence in vivo (35). fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml amphotericin B are mechanistically linked. apoptosis, reovirus virulence and arrest are mechanistically linked. wells were treated prior to plating with a 10-g/ml poly-d-lysine solution. cultures were incubated for the first 24 h in neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented to contain 10% FBS (Gibco), 0.6 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin. pBacT7-M3T3D (1.75 g), pT7-S2T3D (1.75 g), pT7-S2T3D (1.75 g), pT7-S3T3D (1.75 g), and pT7-S4T3D (1.1.5 g) for each transfection, 3 l of TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus) was used per g RT-PCR (Qiagen) with S1-specific primers did not alter the 1 protein sequence. changes introduced into the 1s ORF did not alter the 1 protein sequence. a noncoding signature mutation in the L1 gene of viruses generated by plasmid-based rescue was confirmed. cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with Krishan's stain. cellular DNA content was quantified using a coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. apoptosis was determined by AO staining. monolayers of L929, HeLa, or HCT-116 cells seeded in 24-well plates were adsorbed with reovirus strains at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell at room temperature for 1 h. caspase 3/7 activity in thawed lysates containing 5 103 cell equivalents was quantified using the Caspase-Glo-3/7 assay system (Promega) monolayers of HeLa cells (105 cells/well) grown on coverslips in 24-well plates were adsorbed with reovirus at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell at room temperature for 1 h. monolayers were fixed with 1 ml of methanol at 20\u00b0C for at least 30 min. 546-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) cells were visualized by confocal microscopy using a 60/1.4-numerical-aperture (NA) oil immersion objective (Nikon) mice were inoculated intramuscularly with purified reovirus diluted in PBS. mice were monitored for weight loss and symptoms of disease for 21 days postinoculation. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented to contain 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons were established using cerebral cortices of C57/BL6 embryos at embryonic day 15 (38) monolayers of L929 cells at approximately 90% confluence (3 106 cells) in 60-mm dishes were infected with rDIs-T7 pol. cells were cotransfected with 9 plasmid constructs representing cloned gene segments from the strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) genome. 1s-null, pBacT7-S1T3D 1s-L60Stop, pBacT7-S1T3D 1s-L80Stop, pBacT7-S1T3D 1s-L97stop, pBacT7-S1T3D 1s-R14L, pBacT7-S1T3D 1s-R14L/R15L, plasmid-based rescue was confirmed using RT-PCR and L1-specific primers. reovirus virions were generated using second- or third-passage L929 cell lysate stocks of twice-plaque-purified reovirus. trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, stained with Krishan's stain. cellular DNA content was quantified using a coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. peak versus integral gating was used to exclude doublet events from the analysis. pase 3/7 activity in thawed lysates containing 5 103 cell equivalents was quantified. monolayers of L929, HeLa, or HCT-116 cells seeded in 24-well plates were adsorbed with reovirus strains at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell at room temperature for 1 h. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, washed once with PBS, and fresh medium was added. monolayers of HeLa cells (105 cells/well) grown on coverslips in 24-well plates were adsorbed with reovirus at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell at room temperature for 1 h. cells were fixed with 1 ml of methanol at 20\u00b0C for at least 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 20% normal goat serum in PBS. mice weighing 1.5 to 2 g were inoculated intramuscularly with purified reovirus diluted in PBS. mice were monitored for weight loss and symptoms of disease for 21 days postinoculation and euthanized when found to be moribund. death was not used as an endpoint in these experiments. 1s-null did not alter the proportion of cells in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. rsT3D and rsT3D 1s-null produce comparable yields of viral progeny in cultured cells. rsT3D or rsT3D 1s-null induced apoptosis in nearly 100% of cells. rsT3D induced apoptosis in nearly 100% of cells. the capacity of rsT3D 1s-null to induce apoptosis was reduced. rsT3D 1s-null also induced less caspase 3/7 activity than rsT3D. rsT3D 1s-null also induced less caspase 3/7 activity than rsT3D. rsT3D or rsT3D 1s-null was quantified at 24 h postinfection. results are expressed as the mean caspase 3/7 activity relative to that in mock-infected cells. cell cycle arrest precedes apoptosis following reovirus infection.

RNA viruses also can activate these pathways. avian reovirus induces phosphorylation of ATM that is consistent with DDR activation and causes G2/M arrest. adenovirus E4orf4 (52) and hepatitis B virus X protein (53) directly engage components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which powers mitotic exit. rsT3D induces apoptosis less efficiently than rsT3D in cultured cells. reovirus can activate proapoptotic networks that function regardless of whether 1s is expressed. proinflammatory cytokines secreted in response to reovirus infection may contribute to virus-induced apoptosis by activating death receptors. apoptosis is initiated during binding and entry of reovirus into host cells. fragments of outer-capsid protein 1 generated by endosomal proteases are delivered into the cytoplasm along with the viral core (20, 64) 1s protein may enhance apoptosis by modulating signals initiated by entry-related events. it remains to be determined how signals from 1s integrate with the activities of capsid components known to induce apoptosis. disease develops primarily in neonatal or juvenile hosts (5). rsT3D and rsT3D 1s-null are comparably virulent following intracranial inoculation. reovirus induces apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. it is possible that 1s causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in reovirus-infected intestinal epithelial cells. apoptotic cells filled with progeny virus are engulfed by phagocytic cells. titers of the serotype 1 1s-null virus in the intestine are lower than those produced by wild-type virus (37) reovirus is one of many RNA viruses that modulate cell cycle progression during infection. reovirus is currently being evaluated as an oncolytic adjunct to conventional chemotherapy (78, 79) if 1s-mediated effects on cell cycle control are more evident in proliferating cells, then 1s-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis may be important mechanisms underlying reovirus oncolysis. of 1s function may lead to new insights into these highly regulated, interrelated processes that play fundamental roles in development, immunity, and cancer."}
