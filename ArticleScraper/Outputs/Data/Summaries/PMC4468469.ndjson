{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env transmembrane subunit gp41 contains the fusion peptide (FP) and the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) plays an important role in mediating fusion between the viral envelope and target cell membrane. gp41 changes conformation by inserting FP into the target cell membrane, resulting in the exposure of the NHR domain. n63 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli with expression vector pGEX-6p-N63His-pp-PDI. effect of inhibitory activity of anti-N63 IgG (200 nM) on cell-cell fusion mediated by HIV-1IIIB Env. antibodies specific to the HIV-1 gp41 NHR lacked neutralizing activity at 37\u00b0C. but they could inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion after the effector/target cells and antibodies were incubated at the suboptimal temperature (31.5\u00b0C) for 1 h before the cocultures were transferred to 37\u00b0C. a lower incubation temperature could slow down the transition from the prehairpin intermediate state to the posthairpin fusion state. antibody binding to the gp41 NHR may stabilize interaction of enfuvirtide with the target cell membrane. antibody binding to the gp41 NHR domain may stabilize interaction of enfuvirtide with the target cell membrane. enfuvirtide at 10 nM showed about 42% inhibition. combination of enfuvirtide and anti-N63 serum at 1:20 and 1:50 dilutions showed significantly higher inhibitory activity than that of enfuvirtide alone. anti-gp41 NHR antibodies gain inhibitory activity against HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and HIV-1 infection in the presence of the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. the normal rabbit antibody IgG exhibited no HIV-1 neutralizing activity at a concentration as high as 500 nM. the irrelevant peptide SARS-CP1 exhibited no inhibitory activity at a concentration as high as 500 nM. the effect of the inhibitory activity of enfuvirtide and anti-N63 IgG purified from sera of rabbits immunized with N63, alone or in combination, on HIV-1 infection was determined as previously described (16). culture supernatants were collected for testing p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) each sample was tested in triplicate. the average variability between the results was about 8%. neutralize infection by zidovudine (AZT)-resistant strains, nevirapine-resistant strains, and the multidrug-resistant stain HIV-1RTMDR1/MT-2 with IC50s of about 53.5 0.64, 121.36 12.68, and 48.34 10.78 nM. enfuvirtide did not significantly increase the neutralizing activity of anti-N63 IgG against the enfuvirtide-resistant strain. anti-N63 IgG could also inhibit infection by primary HIV-1 isolates. rabbit anti-N63 IgG could also inhibit infection by primary HIV-1 isolates. all HIV-1 strains were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. each sample was tested in triplicate. the average variability between the results was about 9%. enfuvirtide and anti-N63 IgG purified from sera. binding of the antibodies to the viral gp41 NHR domain may potentiate the interaction between enfuvirtide and NHR trimer. binding of the antibodies to the viral gp41 NHR domain may enhance the antiviral activity of enfuvirtide against HIV-1 strains."}
