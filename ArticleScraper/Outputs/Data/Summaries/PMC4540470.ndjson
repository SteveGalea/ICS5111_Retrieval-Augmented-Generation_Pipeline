{"summary": "schistosoma japonicum is a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts. a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. somiasis is one of the most serious parasitic diseases and affects more than 200 million people globally. somiasis is caused mainly by three Schistosoma species: Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium. the majority of schistosomes used in those studies were isolated from laboratory animals such as BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, and New Zealand white rabbits. the majority of schistosomes used in those studies were isolated from laboratory animals such as BALB/c mice, less susceptible Wistar rats and resistant reed voles. worms perfused out the hepatic portal vein of infected animals at approximately 7 weeks. adult worms were perfused out the hepatic portal vein of infected animals. contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples using a DNA-free kit. a total of 21,861 target sequences (20,194 sequences derived from S. japonicum and 1667 sequences derived from S. mansoni) were provided to Roche NimbleGen for array design. for each sequence, 3 or 4 60-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed. stably and abundantly expressed genes among the adult worms from the four mammalian hosts were extracted using coefficient of variation (CV) 0.1 and fluorescence intensity 10,000 on the basis of retrieval of a panel of well characterized Schistosoma genes of which the intensity values were greater than 10,000. gene ontology and pathway analyses Gene sequences were functionally annotated using Blast2GO [27] and the output provided combined graphics for three categories of gene ontology terms. signal peptides were predicted using the program SignalP 4.1 server employing both the neural network and hidden Markov model [29] and transmembrane helices were predicted using TMHMM 2.0 [30]. sequences were aligned using ClustalX [36] and then refined manually. a phylogenetic tree was finally generated using the neighbor-joining method. Accession numbers Accession numbers for the S. japonicum sequences used in the alignment are: CAX74321.1, CAX74107.1, CAX73316.1, CAX78430.1, CAX72962.1, CAX76177.1, CAX73488.1, CAX78439.1, CAX laboratory BALB/c mice (nine mice), C57BL/6 mice (nine mice), new Zealand white rabbits (three rabbits) and natural reservoir host water buffaloes (three buffaloes) were infected with 40\u2013400 freshly released cercariae through the upper back using the cover glass method. total RNA isolation Total RNA was extracted from worms from different animals using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples using a the design and construction of the microarray and the methods used in microarray hybridization and feature extraction have been previously reported [19\u201321]. a total of 21,861 target sequences (20,194 sequences derived from S. japonicum and 1667 sequences derived from S. mansoni) were provided to Roche NimbleGen for array design. outlier probes were identified and the contribution of outlier probes was reduced in the reported gene expression level. the expression value of a gene is a weighted average of all probes when both background correction and quantile normalization were performed. the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4 gene (PSMD4, GenBank Accession No. FN320595) was employed as a reference gene in the real-time PCR analysis [19]. the relative expression level of each gene was analyzed using SDS 1.4 software (Applied Biosystems) all remaining protein sequences were confirmed by the presence of SCP/TAPS-representative protein domains (IPR014044) using interProScan [31]. a phylogenetic relationship tree was built using the full-length amino acid sequences of Schistosoma VALs in the following steps. correlation analysis of gene expression profiles between biological replicates of schistosomes from different hosts using genome-wide microarray analyses. results showed that the transcriptional profiles between worms from different hosts were highly similar as a whole. 57BL/6 BALB/c Rabbit Buffalo 1 and 2 0.992 0.995 0.996 0.998 1 and 3 0.997 0.998 0.998 0.998 2 and 3 0.995 0.998 0.998 0.998 0.998 0.998 0.998 2 and 3 0.995 0.996 0.998 0.998 0.998 Table 2. a total of 450 non-redundant genes were used for hierarchical clustering. these genes were clustered into four subgroups, of which genes of the biological replicates were clustered together. cluster I, genes that were up-regulated in schistosomes isolated from C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice and up-regulated in schistosomes isolated from buffaloes and rabbits. cluster IV, genes up-regulated in worms from buffaloe a list of representative differentially expressed genes from each cluster is displayed in detail as a heat map. the heat map of 450 differentially expressed genes extracted from the microarray dataset is shown. the color scale represents relative expression levels: red, up-regulated; green, down-regulated; and black, unchanged. a subset of ten genes with different biological functions and different expression patterns was selected for real-time PCR validation. the real-time PCR results well matched the microarray data (Fig 4) with a significant correlation factor of 0.943 (Spearman\u2019s Rho, p0.0001, n = 40), thereby validating the microarray results. genes coding for proteins associated with membrane accounted for the major portion of annotated genes in the cellular components analysis. schistosome genome encodes various growth factors, receptors and other critical components to regulate numerous cellular processes during tissue development. schistosomes can exploit host nutrients and signaling pathways for growth and development. human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an anti-coagulation protein that plays an important role in the regulation of the blood coagulation cascade. one trematode eggshell synthesis protein gene was significantly up-regulated in worms from C57BL/6 mice, buffaloes and rabbits. three annexin genes (Smp_074140, Smp_074150 and Smp_077720) have been identified by proteomic analysis as the membrane-associated constituents of the tegument surface [44] of the annexins, Smp_077720 is significantly up-regulated in the transition from free-living cercaria to parasitic schistosomulum and adult worm and binds to the tegument surface membranes in a Schwarz et al. recently determined that the calcium-dependent endoribonuclease XendoU promotes endoplasmic reticulum network formation through local RNA degradation. pathway mapping for selected differentially expressed genes in worms from BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, rabbits and buffaloes.
