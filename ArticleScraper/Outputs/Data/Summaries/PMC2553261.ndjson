{"summary": "toxins produced by the invertebrate pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are a large family of PFTs that target the intestinal cells of insects and nematodes. there is growing evidence that the response of cells to PFTs is complex and there is a great deal yet to learn. the ire-1 \u2013 xbp-1 arm of the ER is activated upon exposure of C. elegans and mammalian cells to PFTs. we demonstrate that activation of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway by PFT requires p38 MAPK and its associated MAPK kinase. the in vivo response of the UPR to a PFT can be separated from its response to unfolded proteins. xbp-1 mRNA transcript splicing is induced in wild-type C. elegans fed E. coli expressing Cry5B compared to control E. coli not expressing Cry5B. worms fed control bacteria at 20\u00b0C for 8 hours to induce ER stress response by causing unfolded proteins. worm is capable of activating the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway as judged by hsp-4 induction. activation in ire-1-xbp-1-fed animals is occurring only in cells targeted by the PFT. exposure of HeLa cells to proaerolysin leads to increased production of spliced XBP1 protein. the fact that Cry5B only induced expression in intestinal cells suggests the PFT is only targeting these cells. activation of the pathway was ascertained in HeLa cells exposed to the aeromonas hydrophila PFT, aerolysin. the ER stress response is required for defense of C. elegans against the PFT. atf-6(ok551) and pek-1(ok275) mutant animals are slightly intoxicated on low-moderate levels of the PFT Cry5B. the ire-1(v33) and xbp-1(zc12) mutant worms are more severely intoxicated than wild-type worms. the hypersensitivity to Cry5B resulting from lack of ire-1 and xbp-1 was also seen using RNA interference. ire-1(v33) was included only on the plates with 0% Cry5B. lethal concentration assay comparing sensitivity to CuSO4 revealed xbp-1(zc12) is not hypersensitive compared to wild-type N2. atf-6(ok551) mutant animals are also Hpo, albeit to a lesser extent (2.8 vs. 5.8 fold increase in sensitivity for atf-6 vs. xbp-1). sensitivity of pek-1(ok275) mutant animals is not statistically different from that of wild-type animals. newly hatched worms on plates containing different percentages of Cry5B expressing E. coli. this result confirms developmental defects previously seen with this mutant [11], and it was therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. wild type N2 and pek-1(ok275) were both similarly inhibited by Cry5B. the xbp-1 pathway functions in the intestine to protect against the effects of the PFT. the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway is functioning directly in the target cells of the toxin, the intestinal epithelial cells. the pathway is capable of being activated throughout the worm by a more general stress, such as heat shock. in control animals, expression of the GFP solely in intestinal cells was confirmed. the majority of wild-type N2 animals showed only a low-modest degree of intoxication upon exposure to 25% Cry5B-expressing E. coli. both xbp-1(zc12) mutant animals and xbp-1(zc12) mutant animals transformed with app-1::GFP were Hpo and intoxicated to similar extent. the health of the worms (details in Materials and Methods) was evaluated after 72 hours on 25% Cry5B-expressing E. coli. three and six independent lines of app-1::GFP and app-1::xbp-1 were used. the ER stress response mutants differ in their sensitivities to tunicamycin. a lethality assay was used to compare sensitivities of the ER stress mutants and wild-type N2 to tunicamycin. xbp-1 pathway is not required for phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by Cry5B. wild-type N2 and xbp-1(zc12) were exposed to either control buffer or purified Cry5B toxin for one hour. the strains hsp-4::GFP and hsp-4::GFP;pmk-1(km25) were fed either control E. coli or E. coli expressing Cry5B for 8 hours and the expression of GFP was then analyzed. the experiment was performed three times and representative worms are shown. ttm-2 transcripts were determined in response to Cry5B. animals lacking sek-1 MAPKK are more sensitive to Cry5B than animals lacking xbp-1. worms developed into dark, gravid, active, healthy adults. xbp-1 is induced 1.9 fold in animals with an intact p38 MAPK pathway. at the 3 h time point the spliced form of xbp-1 is induced 1.8 fold in sek-1(km4) MAPKK mutant animals relative to untreated controls. in vivo activation of downstream target of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway does not occur in pmk-1(km25) p38 MAPK mutant animals. 11 mRNAs are induced by either Cry5B or tunicamycin. the full induction of both mRNAs is dependent on sek-1 MAPKK. both mRNAs are still somewhat induced by Cry5B in a sek-1(km4) mutant, albeit at lower levels than in wild-type animals. xbp-1 intron spliced by IRE-1 is 23 nucleotides. xbp-1 intron spliced by IRE-1 is 170 fold lower than N2. mutant predicted to be defective in protein glycosylation in the ER. C. elegans fed E. coli expressing Cry5B compared to control non-Cry5B expressing E. coli. in vivo activation of hsp-4::GFP occurs specifically in the intestines of worms fed control bacteria at 20\u00b0C for 8 hours. hsp-4::GFP was fed either control E. coli or Cry5B expressing E. coli for 8 hours at 20\u00b0C. a strong and specific increase in GFP expression in the intestine can be seen in the presence of the PFT. the fact that Cry5B only induced expression in intestinal cells suggests the PFT is targeting these cells. stress response played a role in the defense of C. elegans against the PFT. mutants included those encoding the three ER stress transducer genes. these mutations are predicted or known to be loss of function mutations in their respective genes [11],[12],[13]. ire-1(v33) and xbp-1(zc12) are hypersensitive to Cry5B intoxication. two representative worms are shown for each strain 48 hours after feeding either on E. coli without Cry5B or on E. coli of which 25% expressed Cry5B. a lethal concentration assay comparing sensitivity to H2O2 revealed xbp-1(zc12) is not hypersensitive compared to wild-type N2. the sensitivity of pek-1(ok275) mutant animals is not statistically different from the qualitative plate assay. data analysis of the lethal concentration assays and P. aeruginosa (PA14) lifespan assay was p = 0.05. we used a developmental assay to assess the relative sensitivity of the four ER stress response mutants to Cry5B. ire-1-xbp-1 pathway has a more discernible effect on protection against Cry5B than atf-6, further experiments were focused on this arm of the ER stress response. however, an alternative explanation for our results is that animals mutant in this pathway are sickly and have compromised health. the mutant xbp-1(zc12) has the same sensitivity as wild type to killing by either CuSO4 or H2O2 (a toxic insult that kills rapidly) the pathway is functioning directly in the target cells to protect against the PFT. a marker for downstream activation of the pathway, hsp-4, is turned on exclusively in intestinal cells (Figure 1B, middle panel), although the pathway is capable of being activated throughout the worm by a more general stress, such as heat shock. either untransformed or app-1::GFP transformed xbp-1(zc12) animals fed with Cry5B. this partial rescue could indicate the expression of the artificial xbp-1 transgenes did not recapitulate wild-type xbp-1 expression levels. however, our results support a significant protective function for xbp-1 within the cells targeted by Cry5B. ER stress responses have been studied extensively for their role in protecting cells against unfolded proteins [10],[18]. previous data in C. elegans have indicated different sensitivities of the three ER stress response pathways for tunicamycin [11],[12]. ire-1-xbp-1 pathway plays a role in the PFT-induced activation of p38. p38 activation occurs normally in xbp-1(zc12) mutant animals. p38 activation occurs in wild-type and xbp1(zc12) animals. ry5B induced splicing of xbp-1 requires sek-1 (MAPKK) xbp-1 mRNA was compared in glp-4(bn2) and glp-4(bn2);sek-1(km4) after 3 hours of exposure to either control (DMSO) or tunicamycin (2 g/mL) tunicamycin induces GFP throughout both the strains hsp-4::GFP and hsp-4::GFP;pmk-1(km25), including within the intestinal cells. the experiment was performed three times and representative worms are shown. xbp-1(zc12) were as small, pale, inactive, and severely intoxicated as sek-1(km4) animals. xbp-1(zc12) was more intoxicated than N2 but not as intoxicated as sek-1(km4) animals. scale bar is 0.2 mm. intestinal cells does not occur in pmk-1(km25) p38 MAPK mutant animals. activation of hsp-4::GFP by tunicamycin does occur normally in pmk-1(km25) mutant animals. to independently confirm and extend these results, we analyzed a different downstream target of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway. the gene encoding this protein was previously demonstrated to be transcriptionally regulated by tunicamycin in an ire-1 and xbp-1 the p38 pathway is upstream of the UPR, is required for full activation of the UPR in response to PFT. the p38 pathway is involved in UPR-independent PFT defense pathways (e.g., ttm-2). sek-1(km4) animals are more severely intoxicated than xbp-1(zc12) animals at the same dose of Cry5B. stress response has been linked with innate immunity since induction of ER stress can activate CREB-H. it has also been suggested that IRE-1 could influence immunity via its association with TRAF-2, which in turn can regulate NF-B [23]. data from studies in plants suggest that in response to pathogens, signals can be produced that lead to an \"anticipatory\" UPR. the p38 pathway itself is implicated extensively in innate immune protection of many organisms against pathogens [31] and against PFTs in worms and mammals [6],[7]. p38 MAPK activates ire-1-xbp-1 that induces splicing of xbp-1, which then turns on defense against PFTs. p38 MAPK and turn on the UPR to anticipate and ameliorate the detrimental effects of unfolded proteins. a second model is that activation of the ER stress response by Cry5B in a p38 MAPK dependent manner may prepare the cell to handle an altered biosynthetic load in the ER to defend against a toxin. ire-1-xbp-1 pathway leads to increased phospholipid biogenesis. ire-1-xbp-1 was activated by p38 MAPK in response to tunicamycin. divergent pathways regulated by p38 MAPK in protective responses reveal how studying pathogenesis can uncover a wonderful complexity and new connections among intracellular pathways. worms were fed for 48 hours either on control plates with E. coli JM103 expressing Cry5B (empty vector) or plates prepared with E. coli JM103 expressing Cry5B diluted 13 with empty vector transformed JM103. worms were scored after 8 days for Cry5B, CuSO4, and tunicamycin. transgenic worms were placed on the 25% E. coli expressing Cry5B plates and their health status was assessed 72 hours later. the relative health of each worm was determined qualitatively by comparing body size, dark intestines and continuous spontaneous movement. bn2) strain was used for experiments including double mutants glp-4(bn2);xbp-1(zc12) an glp-4(bn2); sek-1(km4). response to Cry5B is not altered in this strain compared to wild type. 15,000 worms were used per 100 mm dish for each treatment group. real time PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 Instrument. eft-2 was used as the real time PCR normalization control. three independent experiments for the splicing and real time PCR were performed for each treatment. 750 worms were grown in a single well of a 48 well plate containing 150 L S media [42] and E. coli OP50. glucose was added to 100 mM and either 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) or Cry5B dissolved in 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) to give a final concentration of 100 g/mL was added. after one hour, worms were removed, centrifuged, the lethal concentration assays are represented graphically using nonlinear regression performed with the software GraphPad Prism. Statistical analysis between two values was compared with matched one way ANOVA using the Tukey post test. worms were fed for 48 hours either on control plates with E. coli JM103 expressing Cry5B (empty vector) or plates prepared with E. coli JM103 expressing Cry5B diluted 13 with empty vector transformed JM103. worms were scored after 8 days for Cry5B, CuSO4, and tunicamycin. aeruginosa lifespan assay was performed on slow-killing plates as described [40]. the experiment was performed three times with approximately 100\u2013150 worms total per strain, at 20\u00b0C. worms were rinsed from plates with water, centrifuged at 500 g for 45 seconds, and washed two additional times with water. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using oligo-dT. standard PCR was used to detect xbp-1 splicing. real time PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 Instrument using SYBR Green detection (Applied Biosystems) eft-2 was used as the real time PCR normalization control. glucose was added to 100 mM and 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) or Cry5B dissolved in 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) to give a final concentration of 100 g/mL was added. worms were removed, centrifuged, and 175 L of media was removed. 80,000 worms of each strain were used for both control and Cry5B treatments. Statistical analysis among three or more values was compared with matched one way ANOVA using the Tukey post test. p0.05 was set at p0.05."}
