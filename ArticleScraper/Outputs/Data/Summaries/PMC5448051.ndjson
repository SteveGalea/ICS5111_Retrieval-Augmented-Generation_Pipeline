SSa dose-dependently inhibited the production of ROS, TNF-, IL-8, COX-2, and iNOS in human umbilical endothelial cells. a herbal formula called \u201cRCM-101\u201d inhibited NO production and iNOS protein expression in rat aorta and Raw 264.7 macrophages. the extracts and compounds of Radix Bupleuri could inhibit proliferation of human lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner via causing cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. SSd exerted its antitumor effect in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. the mechanism of cytotoxicity was attributed to the induction of apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. this resulted in poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. saikosaponins exerted antiviral activity on human coronavirus-229E. the strongest activity was observed for saikosaponin b2 with an IC50 of 1.7 m. saikosaponins exerted antiviral activity on human coronavirus-229E at concentrations of 0.25\u201325 m. antipyretic effects The water extract of Radix Bupleuri exerted its antipyretic effect on dry yeast-induced rats. the mechanism is related to the adjustment of synthesis and exudation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). raw and vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri showed liver protective effects against CCl4 induced liver injury. saikosaponins showed remarkable inhibition of D-galactosamine-induced hepatic injury through decreasing the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and NADPH-cytochrome C reductase. bupleurosides III, VI, IX, and XIII and saikosaponin b3 isolated from Bu Radix Bupleuri significantly increased the amplitude of spontaneous activity of lymphatic vessels in a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanisms of this effect seem to be independent of endothelial function [102] autophagy contributes to pathogenesis of diverse diseases, such as neuronal degeneration, inflammatory bowel disease, aging, and cancer. the protective pharmacological effects of Radix Bupleuri might be attributed to its autophagy induction. e was found to be 45.15%, 33.94%, 24.94%, and 34.54% respectively. SSa isolated from Radix Bupleuri significantly reduced seizure severity and duration. it downregulated the expression of p-mTOR, p-70S6K, L-1, and TNF- through inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway. four polyacetylenes (36\u201339) from Radix Bupleuri potently exhibited an antidepressant activity by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. the mechanism might be mediated by increasing the level of monoamines, particularly 5-HT and NE. a Regulates MAPK and NF-B signals pathways Saikosaponin a In vivo [68] LPS-stimulated human umbilical endothelial cells Activates the LXR-ABCA1 signaling pathway Saikosaponin a In vivo [69] Septic rats model Inhibits the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2)/NF-B signaling pathway Saikosa s ERK 1/2 and caspase-3/9 Acetone extracts In vitro [77\u201379] Human non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells Regulates Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway Saponins In vitro [80] HepG2 hepatoma cells Induce cell arrest at the late G1/early S phase Water extracts In vitro [6] HepG2 cell line Activates caspase-3 and caspase-7 Saikos essential oil In vivo [91] Turpentine-induced fever rabbits and rats Decreases body temperature The essential oil In vivo [92] Antibacterial effect Helicobacter pylori strain Anti-Helicobacter pylori Ethanol extracts In vitro [93] Staphylococcus aureus strain Anti-Staphylococcus aureus injection In vitro [95] Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Male Wistar rats Increases the level of 5-HT and NE Polyacetylenes In vivo [56] Dactylogyrus spp. infecting goldfish Anthelmintic activity Saikosaponins a and d In vivo [113] 5.1. x Bupleuri has been widely used for the treatment of several types of chronic inflammatory diseases. saikosaponins from Radix Bupleuri exerted anti-inflammatory activity on inflammatory processes including inhibition of inflammatory exudation, capillary permeability, inflammatory mediators release, migration of white cells, connective tissue hyperplasia. SSa also suppressed TNF- and IL-6 concentrations in the intestines of septic rats through inhibition of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2)/NF-B signaling pathway. a wide range of Radix Bupleuri preparations also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in in vitro and in vivo model. acetone extract of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium possessed anticancer/antitumor effect. SSd exerted its antitumor effect in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 through the HIF-1/COX-2 pathway. treatment with \"xiao-chai-hu decoction\" showed a significantly lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. SSc has been reported to show effective anti-HBV activity through inhibiting DNA expression of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV. saikosaponins exerted antiviral activity on human coronavirus-229E at concentrations of 0.25\u201325 m. strongest activity was observed for saikosaponin b2 with an IC50 of 1.7 m. antipyretic effects The water extract of Radix Bupleuri exerted its antipyretic effect on dry yeast-induced high fever rats. saikosaponins isolated from Radix Bupleuri exhibit antibacterial activity. protective effect was attributed to immunomodulatory action on macrophages. no effects were observed against CCl4 induced liver injury. saikosaponins isolated from Bupleurum chinense DC exhibit protective effect on cytotoxicity in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. hepatic enzyme levels (GOT, GPT, and ALP) and lipid peroxidation in the liver were significantly reduced by the administration of SSd. SSd significantly reduced collagen I deposition and alanine aminotransferase level on liver fibrosis rats. SSd modulated lymphocyte activity through suppressing the T cell response and increasing the B cell response to different mitogens and the interleukin- (IL-) 2/IL-4 production. SSd was shown to inhibit OKT3/CD28-costimulated human T cell proliferation and PMA, PMA/ionomycin, and Con A-induced mouse T cell activation in vitro. the effect of the ethanol extract from Radix Bupleuri on cytochrome 450 isoform activities was evaluated using a six-drug cocktail approach. the results showed that Radix Bupleuri had strong induction activity on the CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. the inhibition rate of Radix Bupleuri extracts RB1 (high molecular weight polysaccharides), RB2 (ethanol soluble/water insoluble component), SSc also induced endothelial cells migration and capillary tube formation. underlying mechanisms might be related to gene expression or activation of MMP-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, ERK) the pharmacological effects of Radix Bupleuri must be urgently explored on our modern understanding of these diseases' pathophysiologies. we can conclude that the extracts and the compounds from this plant can prevent or treat certain diseases, such as cancer, fever, malaria, hepatitis, and AD. c6 rat glioma cells Inhibits PGE2 production and elevates intracellular free Ca2+ concentration Saikosaponin d In vivo [72] Monoclonal antibody induced nephritis Suppresses proteinuria, proliferation of mesangial cells, and expansion of the mesangial matrix Saikosaponin d In vivo [73] chronic pancreatitis rats model Inhibits antiviral effect H1N1-infected A549 cells Anti-H1N1 virus Acetone extracts In vitro [10] HBV-transfected human hepatoma cells Inhibits DNA expression of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV Saikosaponin c In vitro [87] HBV-transfected human hepatoma cells Inhibits the production of HBV and the expression of HBeAg Crude hepatic injury in rats Decreases the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and NADPH-cytochrome C reductase; increases 5\u2032-nucleotidase activity Saikosaponins In vivo [97] BEL-7402 cells Regulate intracellular calcium levels Saikosaponins In vivo [99] CCl4 induced acute hepatic injury in rats Hepatoprotective effects Saikosapon ponin a In vivo [109] THP-1 Cells Inhibits PI3K/Akt/NF-B/NLRP3 signaling pathway Saikosaponin c In vitro [111] Male Wistar rats Increase the level of 5-HT and NE Polyacetylenes In vivo [56] Dactylogyrus spp. infecting goldfish Anthelmintic activity Saikosaponins a and d In vivo i-Hu-Tang induced acute hepatotoxicity with asynchronous state, higher heart rate, and fast breathing. a selective and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of SSa, b2, c, and d in rat plasma afteroral administration of the ethanol-water extract of Radix Bupleuri. 74 compounds including essential oils, triterpenoid saponins, polyacetylenes, flavonoids, lignans, fatty acids, and sterols have been isolated and identified from Radix Bupleuri. pharmacological studies have revealed that Radix Bupleuri possesses a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, antipyretic, antibacterial, antiobesity, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective toxicity, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and molecular mechanism are necessary to be explored to develop its bioactive compounds as effective drugs. conflicts of interest The authors have declared that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper."}
