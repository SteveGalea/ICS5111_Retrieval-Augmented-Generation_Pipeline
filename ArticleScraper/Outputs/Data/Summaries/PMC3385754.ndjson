{"summary": "the coalescent is a framework that predicts distributional aspects of branch lengths in temporal phylogenetic trees in terms of a demographic parameter called the effective population size. this is the most recent common ancestor and the time to it from the present is known as the time to the most recent common ancestor. the probability that two lineages in one generation have a common ancestor lineage in the previous generation is equal to 1/Ne. the classical skyline plot allows a non-parametric estimation of the past effective population size to be made. the classical skyline plot [5] reduces the noise and stochasticity found in classical skyline plots. this analysis covers a seven week period at the start of the pandemic. this analysis covers a seven week period at the start of the pandemic. it is possible to specify specific parametric models for the effective population size, such as exponential growth. each week over this five week period (no attempt was made to account for possible clusters), giving 110 in total. the BSP shows an increase in Ne throughout April followed by a slowdown towards the end of April. the TMRCA is 85 (CI: 48\u2013161) days (i.e. 28 February 2009; CI: 6 April 2009\u201314 December 2008) Stack et al. [16] have performed a similar exercise for seasonally fluctuating influenza epidemics. they show how different sampling protocols can influence inferred transmission dynamics in BSPs. their analysis indicates that single-generation sampling or sampling randomly about a target generation as the epidemic begins to slow down is the most effective strategy. the seed sequence is generation 0 at time t = 0 and its offspring comprise generation 1 and time, t = Tg and their offspring generation 2 and time t = 2Tg and so on, where Tg is the generation time. in our simulation, we choose a mutation rate of 1.83e4 sub per site per generation, faster than the estimate of Rambaut et al. we introduce the individual reproductive number, which is the expected number of secondary cases caused by a specific infected individual. if is gamma-distributed having a mean R and dispersion parameter k, then the number of secondary infections caused by each infected individual is Poisson distributed with mean. for k = 1, the distribution is geometric, while it becomes Poisson as k. we assume a mean generation time of 2.6 days and standard deviation 1.3 days [21], giving = 4 and = 1. the nucleotide transition probability matrix over time interval, t is: where we wish to average this transition matrix over the generation time distribution. we examine two sampling schemes: uniform and log-proportional. a feature of virological surveillance during an epidemic is that some geographically localized outbreaks can be heavily sampled. some geographically localized outbreaks can be heavily sampled, whereas others are sampled much less, if at all. this results in groups of sequences that are closely related (genetically) and thus no longer constitute a random sample of all sequences. the ESS is the number of effectively independent draws from a marginal posterior distribution of a parameter that a particular length of MCMC chain is equivalent to. a low ESS for a given parameter implies high correlation between MCMC samples and that the posterior distribution will be poor. each BEAST run is repeated at least twice so as to independently confirm convergence. this equals 1.57e5 sub per site per day, which for a generation time of 2.6 days is 4.1e5 sub per site per generation. in our simulation, we choose a mutation rate of 1.83e4 sub per site per generation, faster than the estimate of Rambaut et al. the probability p(m) of obtaining m from a negative binomial distribution with parameters p and k is given by: in general, lower values of k correspond to more heterogeneity in infectiousness. for k = 1, the distribution is geometric, while it becomes Poisson as k. under uniform sampling, we randomly pick one sample per generation of simulated sequences. this would be analogous to choosing to sequence a virus from a randomly selected infected person at regular temporal intervals, perhaps set by laboratory capacity. this is closer to how viral samples are collected during an epidemic where more samples are collected if more individuals are infected. simulated HA sequences were first aligned using ClustalX [26] and the multiple alignments visually confirmed. the aligned sequences were then imported into BEAST together with the dates each sample was collected. a nucleotide substitution model of Hasegawa et al. [27] was used to generate simulated data. each BEAST run is repeated at least twice so as to independently confirm convergence. the package \u2018FigTree\u2019 is used to plot the maximum clade credibility tree. results The simulation generates full-length HA sequences for each infected individual. black lines show the true number of infected individuals per generation from the simulated data. black lines are the instantaneous effective population size found by correcting the simulated number of individuals infected. proportional 2 1 56 47 (46.8, 47.4) 1658 (324, 14 059) uniform 2 10 18 44.6 (44.2, 45.4) 444 (49, 3632) proportional 2 10 55 44.5 (44.2, 45.4) 1403 (292, 10 095) uniform 2.5 0.1 13 31.7 (31.2, 32.5) 250 (22, 2074) proportional 2.5 0.1 41 31.8 (31.2, 32.7) 562 (97, 39.4) 117 (15, 1094) proportion the blue curves graph the BSPs generated from the same simulated sequences via log-proportional sampling. these estimates were therefore generated with many more sequences. the gains in accuracy achieved by denser sampling are modest. the bias of apparent flattening towards the present is only modestly reduced. the lack of genealogical information at later times is also visible in the increased size of the highest posterior density confidence intervals in the BSP over this period. for an exponentially growing viral population, the phylogenetic tree is \u2018star-like\u2019. we suggest that the BSP could be truncated at the time of the last coalescent event, rather than at the time of the last sample collection event. the sharpness of the transition in the flattening of the LTT curve in figure 3b is striking and figure 3d illustrates the effect of sampling density on the shape of the LTT. non-random sampling Figure 4 shows the effects on the BSP of sampling increasingly more epidemiologically linked sequences from a simulated epidemic. here, we simulate an epidemic with R = 1.35 and k = 1 over 36 generations. the purple curve (0% randomly sampled) shows the BSP inferred by sampling (one sequence per generation) from just one lineage, that is one direct descendent generation-to-generation. coloured lines show true numbers of infections (sequences) over time. non-random sampling is effectively flat and close to one. we tested whether a parametric (exponential) model improves estimates. metric and exponential inferred growth rates for log proportional sampling per generation and log-proportional sampling of generations with more than 100 sequences per generation. simulated growth rate non-parametric Bayesian MCMC estimated growth rate exponential coalescent estimated growth rate delayed sampling. 0.053 0.056 0.056 (0.048, 0.064) 0.051 0.054 (0.042, 0.065) 0.051 0.054 (0.042, 0.065) 0.051 0.054 the same samples were analysed using beAST to estimate an exponential growth rate for a parametric coalescent model with assumed exponentially growing effective population size. the same samples were also analysed using beAST to estimate an exponential growth rate for a parametric coalescent model. this time randomly sampling proportionally from generations that have more than 100 sequences. this time only sampling sequences from generations that have more than 100 sequences results in much improved parametric and non-parametric estimates of growth rate than when sampling all generations. a key assumption of the coalescent is broken when the number of infected individuals is small. bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) produced by sampling simulated data sparsely. red curves show median Ne estimates when just one sequence is randomly sampled per generation. blue curves show the corresponding estimates for a more dense sampling. model used to generate the data is shown (R = 1.5, 2, 2.5 and k = 0.1, 1, 10) black lines show the true number of infected individuals per generation from the simulated data.
