{"summary": "PERSPECTIVE In 2014, the white house issued a moratorium on so-called gain-of-function research involving influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. a deliberative process to be managed by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), which recently concluded with the release of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2019s recommended policy guidance document (1, 2). human errors after an exposure can drastically exacerbate the consequences of an incident. despite dominance of human error in determining risk, we could find limited data to support a quantitative estimate of human failure rates. we could find limited data to support a quantitative estimate of human failure rates. despite a clear need for keeping these records, the united states has no standardized or comprehensive system for tracking laboratory incidents or near misses in high-containment laboratories. this lack of centralization and standardization hinders the spread of lessons learned and best practices between laboratories, which likely results in us suffering the same mistakes in multiple laboratories. biosafety levels can begin to be defined by the maximum risk of an experiment allowed under that safety level, instead of being defined by organism phenotype. absolute numbers enable comparisons across industries and activities, which contextualize the level of biosafety risk we are assuming. the NSABB's recommendations for overseeing gain-of-function research included a recommendation to create such a database of incidents and near misses. many institutions have expressed reluctance to share information about biosafety incidents due to a lack of standard definitions of what qualifies as reportable. a new annual allocation of a mere 1/10th of 1% of that number could make significant strides to cover these gaps. a second step would be building consensus for a complete definition of what should be reportable. a second step would be building consensus for a complete definition of what should be reportable. some institutions maintained a strong safety culture that likely played a significant role in reducing the risk of accident in these labs. but how to create this culture and the effect it has on overall safety remain understudied. despite these efforts, large gaps in our knowledge on how accidents did and could occur in laboratories still exist. it is time to make that transition a reality. it is time to make that transition a reality."}
