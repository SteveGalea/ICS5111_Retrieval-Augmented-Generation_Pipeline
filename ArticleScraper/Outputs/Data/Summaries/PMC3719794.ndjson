{"summary": "positive-sense RNA viruses encompass one-third of the viral genera. they include numerous pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), west Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and western, eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. identification of host proteins required for viral amplification would help identify possible targets for antivirals. new antivirals or combination therapies are required for developing effective antivirals. the major obstacle to this approach is our limited knowledge of which host factors are required for viral amplification. the major obstacle to this approach is our limited knowledge of which host factors are required for viral amplification. the viral genome encodes a large polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved by viral proteases. viral replication occurs in the cytoplasm by synthesis of a minus-strand RNA that is used as a template for synthesis of the plus-strand RNA genomes that are packaged. virions are released following cell lysis (17). heLaUPRT and 911 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the cells were supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 to select for the UPRT gene. titers were determined on either HeLaUPRT (PV) or 911 (adenovirus) cells. the dicistronic reporter was expressed under the control of the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. as an additional control for cap-dependent translation, a reporter plasmid was cotransfected with the IRES construct. a total of 5 106 HeLaUPRT cells were either infected with poliovirus (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) or not (mock infected) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in CPBS (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 mg/ml MgCl2 and CaCl2) with or without 10 g/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 1 h. five micrograms RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min. then resuspended in RNA loading buffer (1 MOPS, 10 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA [pH 7.0]) gel was transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and cross-linked to the membrane using a UV Stratalinker 2400. cells were exposed to 365 nm UV for 20 min, followed by lysis (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 500 mM lithium chloride [LiCl], 10 mM EDTA [pH 8], 0.1% lithium dodecyl sulfate [LDS], 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholic acid [DOC], 5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 1 cOm at 5 hpi, cells were cross-linked and RNA-protein complexes were isolated using Dynabead oligo(dT)25 beads (Invitrogen) the proteins were digested in solution with trypsin (Promega), separated by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) using a linear 3-h liquid chromatography gradient (Ultimate 3000 RSLC; Dionex), and detected online by tandem mass spectrome gene ontology (GO) classification was performed using either ProteinCenter (version 3.7), the BiNGO Cytoscape plugin (24, 25) using external ontology and gene association annotations. functional network analysis was performed and visualized by STRING (www.string-db.org) and Cytoscape. or control siRNA was transfected twice at 0 and 3 days and at 5 days. cells were infected with PV, mengovirus, or adenovirus 5 at an MOI of 0.1. virus was harvested and titers were determined using HeLaUPRT cells. qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and complementary strand-specific primers (PVpos reverse or PVneg reverse) at 5 hpi, cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of FA lysis buffer. cell viability was reported relative to negative-control siRNA (set to 100%; n = 3). lysates were precleared with 75 l of a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead (Sigma-Aldrich) in TE (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. ten percent of the precleared lysate was set aside for the input. d with 100 l of RIP elution buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 1% [wt/vol] SDS, 1 l/ml RNasin) cDNA was generated from equivalent amounts (1/10 of starting material) input, supernatant, and coimmunoprecipitate. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) luciferase activity was measured using 4 l of lysate and the dual-luciferase kit. all activities were measured using an FB 12 luminometer (Berthold) all assays were measured in duplicate, and experiments were performed in triplicate. lentivirus was generated by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with a plasmid containing myc-tagged UPRT and plasmids expressing tat and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) the cells were supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 to select for the UPRT gene. the dicistronic reporter was expressed under the control of the simian virus 40 promoter. a reporter plasmid containing the -galactosidase gene was cotransfected. a total of 5 106 HeLaUPRT cells were either infected with poliovirus (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) or not (mock infected) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in CPBS (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 mg/ml MgCl2 and CaCl2) with or without 10 g/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 1 h. total RNA was five micrograms of total RNA was biotinylated with pyridyldithiol-biotin (biotin-HPDP) in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA) for 1.5 h at 25\u00b0C in the dark. then RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min. then resuspended HRP was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography. after 1 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM, 10% FBS, 10 g/ml Act D, and 1 mM 4-thiouracil. at 5 hpi, cells were incubated in starvation medium plus 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer) at 5 hpi, cells were cross-linked and RNA-protein complexes were isolated using Dynabead oligo(dT)25 beads (Invitrogen) the proteins were digested in solution with trypsin (Promega), separated by reverse-phase nano- peptides having >90% peptide probability in one biological replicate and at minimum one unique peptide having >90% peptide probability in the other biological replicate. gene ontology classification was performed using either ProteinCenter (version 3.7), the BiNGO Cytoscape plugin (24, 25) using external ontology and gene association annotations. the cells were infected with PV, mengovirus, or adenovirus 5 at an MOI of 0.1. at either 6 (poliovirus), 5.5 (mengovirus), or 30 (adenovirus 5) hpi, virus was harvested and titers were determined using HeLaUPRT cells. qRT-PCR of total RNA isolated using TRIzol (Ambion) was performed to measure the efficiency of the knockdown. cell viability was measured using the Vybrant MTT assay kit. on X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 cOmplete protease inhibitors, EDTA free [Roche Applied Science], 1 l/ml RNasin [Promega] on ice for 15 min. lysates were precleared with 75 l of a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead in TE (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1 mM ED coimmunoprecipitates were eluted with 100 l of RIP elution buffer. cDNA was generated from equivalent amounts (1/10 of starting material) input, supernatant, and coimmunoprecipitate. cDNA was amplified by PCR with PV-specific primers. d using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocols. cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 100 l of Tropix lysis solution. all activities were measured using an FB 12 luminometer (Berthold) all assays were measured in duplicate. cells that express uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) will incorporate 4-thiouridine (4sU) into all newly synthesized RNAs. UPRT converts 4TU into UMP, which is then converted by cellular kinases to thiouridine triphosphate (4sUTP) RNA from mock- and PV-infected cells was isolated either by TRIzol or by the TUX-MS method. RNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining of the gel. cells were infected with PV in the presence or absence of 4TU. a viral RNA band appears at 7.5 kb, corresponding to newly synthesized viral RNA (lane 2). Addition of actinomycin D (Act D) inhibits cellular transcription, but not the viral polymerase results in labeling of only the viral RNA (lane 3). if 4TU was omitted from the medium, then no RNA was detected on the Northwestern blot. oligo(dT)25-based capture consistently yielded more cellular mRNAs than uninfected cells. however, RNA extracted by TRIzol consistently yielded equivalent cellular mRNA levels. this difference is due to the significant cytopathic effect by 5 hpi in PV-infected cells. two PV-infected samples were prepared independently for TUX-MS analysis. the PV-infected samples yielded an average of 75 unique peptides. the PV RNA encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into mature proteins. 3B (VPg), the genome-linked protein, was most likely run off the bottom of the gel due to its small size (3 kDa) however, a single peptide was detected by LC-MS/MS that correspond to a region within 3B. TUX-MS identified peptides that cover all of the viral proteins expected to interact with the viral RNA. whole-cell [35S]methionine-labeled lysates were obtained from mock-infected (lanes 1 to 3) and PV-infected (lanes 6 to 8) cells. asterisks indicate the PV proteins that cross-linked to the viral RNA (lane 5). cellular proteins are known to act as viral RNA-binding host factors for PV. inhibition 80 ATP-dependent RNA helicase A DHX9 Q08211 3.3 (56) N/C RNA helicase Replication 81 Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 3 (SRP20) SFRS3 P84103 3.3 (20) N RNA binding Translation 82 Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (DRBP76) ILF3 Q12906 2.1 (65) N/C Transcriptional regulation Translation, inhibition 80 Heter c Cellular localization is indicated as nuclear (N) or cytoplasmic (C) N/C, proteins known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. e Stage of the virus life cycle in which the protein is active. 82 cellular proteins passed strict inclusion criteria. the remaining 66 host proteins (Table 3) have not previously been implicated in enterovirus amplification. 23 proteins were exclusively detected in the samples isolated from the PV-infected cells. 43 proteins were enriched in the RNP complexes isolated from PV-infected cells at least 2-fold over mock-infected cells using spectral counting analysis. functional associations were retained with a combined score of >0.5. proteins identified as unique or enriched in PV-infected samples were uploaded to ProteinCenter (version 3.7) 1A MYBBP1A Q9BQG0 148.9 12 12 INF DBP N/C +++ SAFB-like transcription modulator SLTM Q9NWH9 117.2 8 11 INF RRM N ++ KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated protein 1 KHDRBS1 Q07666 48.2 10 11 INF RRM N ++++ HIV-1 94 TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N TAF transcription factor 1 BCLAF1 Q9NYF8 106.1 5 5 INF DBP N/C +++ Histone H2B type 1-D HIST1H2BD P58876 13.9 2 5 INF DBP N +++++ RNA-binding protein EWS EWSR1 Q01844 68.5 4 5 INF RRM N/C +++ HCV HCV 99 Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 5 SFRS5 Q13243 3 RBP N +++ Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G RBMX P38159 42.3 18 35 5.8 RRM N +++ Ras GTPase-activating protein 2 G3BP2 Q9UN86 54.1 5 6 5.5 RRM C +++ rRNA 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase fibrillarin FBL P22087 33.8 5 6 5.5 RBP N +++ Transcriptional activator protein Pur-alpha PU protein A0 HNRNPA0 Q13151 30.8 9 11 3.5 RRM N ++++ Protein FAM98A Q8NCA5 55.4 3 4 3.5 +++ Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase A PPIA P62937 18.0 3 4 3.5 N/C +++++ Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5 DDX5 P17844 69.1 28 51 3.4 RBP the mass spectroscopy was performed on two poliovirus-infected samples. the data presented represent an average of results between those data sets. e Average fold increase in total spectra for PV-infected versus mock-infected control. most of the identified host factors are RNA binding proteins (RBP) or have RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) the vast majority of the known host factors (Table 2) are either hnRNPs (heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins), nuclear proteins, or proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. a similar trend was observed for host factors identified by TUX-MS (36/65). GO clustering analysis of host factors found an enrichment in the coding region instability determinant (CRD)-mediated mRNA stability complex. we identified four out of five members of this complex, DHX9, YBX1, SYNCRIP, and hnRNP U, which is a cytoplasmic RNP that has been shown to control c-Myc stability. eight host factors were chosen for experimental validation from Table 3. for these proteins, we observed efficient knockdown, without an impact on cell viability. the greatest effects on PV amplification (64% and 53% decreases) were observed when CNBP was knocked down. depletion of host proteins found to interact with PV RNA has an impact on PV amplification. cells were transfected with either control or specific siRNAs as indicated. qRT-PCR of mRNA levels following knockdowns normalized to both -actin and GAPDH mRNA levels. poliovirus-infected cells were harvested at 5 hpi and subject to immunoprecipitation with NONO, c-myc, or no antibody (No-Ab). RNA was isolated from input, supernatant (Sup), and immunoprecipitation (IP) identification of NONO by the TUX-MS method suggests that NONO is directly bound to the viral RNA to promote PV amplification. this suggests that NONO directly binds to PV RNA to promote PV amplification. this suggests that NONO is directly bound to the viral RNA. at 4 hpi, two independent siRNAs that target NONO resulted in a decrease in PV amplification. if the titer of virus is determined on cells following NONO knockdowns, then there is a corresponding decrease in plaque number and size. in the absence of the host factors there is a delay in viral production. qRT-PCR was used to determine number of plus-strand (C) and minus-strand (D) RNAs at 4 hpi. mRNA levels after qRT-PCR of mRNA following knockdown were normalized to -actin. Knockdown of NONO had no effect on PV IRES activity. knockdown of PCBP2 and CNBP reduced PV IRES activity by 38% and 26% respectively. results demonstrate a more significant effect on viral replication for NONO than the previously known host factor, PCBP2. this is the first demonstration that PCBP2 is required for mengovirus amplification. however, knockdown of NONO or CNBP did not significantly affect amplification of mengovirus. this suggests that these host factors may be specific to poliovirus or within the Enterovirus genus. RNA from mock- and PV-infected cells was isolated either by TRIzol or by the TUX-MS method. total RNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining of the gel (bottom) prior to transfer to the membrane. titer was determined by plaque assay. the heterogeneous distribution of mRNA detected by Northwestern analysis. if cells were infected with PV for 5 h, an additional viral RNA band appears at 7.5 kb. addition of actinomycin D (Act D), which inhibits cellular transcription, results in labeling of only the viral RNA (lane 3). oligo(dT)25-based capture consistently yielded more cellular mRNAs than uninfected cells. however, RNA extracted by TRIzol consistently yielded equivalent cellular mRNA levels. this difference is due to the significant cytopathic effect (CPE) by 5 hpi in PV-infected cells. fected and infected samples were used based on the levels of cellular mRNA determined by Northern analysis. proteins were released from purified RNA-protein complexes by digestion with RNase A, digested in solution with trypsin. two PV-infected samples were prepared independently for TUX-MS analysis. 3B (VPg), the genome-linked protein, was most likely run off the bottom of the gel due to its small size (3 kDa) however, a single peptide was detected by LC-MS/MS that correspond to a region within 3B.

DDX17 is a binding partner and cofactor for zinc finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1 (ZAP) it targets the RNA of retroviruses, filoviruses, and alphaviruses for degradation (63\u201365) and potentially poliovirus. the majority of the assayed host factors appear to be enhancers of PV amplification. the majority of the proteins identified by TUX-MS are either nuclear or cycle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during viral infection. this suggests that TUX-MS is a robust assay to identify host proteins that bind the viral RNA during infection in cell culture. TUX-MS can identify additional host factors with a low false-positive discovery rate even for a well-studied virus, such as poliovirus. spectral counting analysis was used for relative quantification for TUX-MS as it is computationally facile, well suited to detect large differences in relative abundance. one disadvantage is the lack of sensitivity for proteins that generate low spectral counts, or poor ability to be detected by MS. the TUX-MS method could also be modified to be performed without inhibition of host transcription. this would entail labeling of all RNA in the cell with 4sU followed by isolation of the viral RNA-protein complexes using a virus-specific oligonucleotide(s) instead of oligo(dT). TUX-MS could also be expanded to be used on viruses that require host transcription."}
