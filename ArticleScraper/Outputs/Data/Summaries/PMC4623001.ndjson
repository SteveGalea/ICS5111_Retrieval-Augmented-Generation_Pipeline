Clones in bold and bold/italic showed no () or only very weak (+/) neutralizing activity. scFv-huFc-1 antibodies were cloned and expressed in HEK-293T cells as human fusion proteins. scFv-huFc-1 expression levels were sufficiently high for direct use in further ELISA and in vitro IL17A neutralization assays. a dose response assay was performed by stimulating HFF-1 cells with serial dilutions of IL17A. a measurable IL6 response was observed at an IL17A concentration as low as 1 ng/ml, whereas saturation was reached at approximately 1 g/ml. to measure neutralization by antibodies, an IL17A concentration of 50 ng/ml in the linear range of the dose response curve was chosen. clones 5M007 and 5M024 neutralized IL17A with an IC50 of 30 pM and 63 pM. a second clonotype, represented by clones 5M010 and 5M012, had IC50s of 51 pM and 24 pM. antibody 5M002 had an IC50 of 0.94 nM. the 2 clones show 2 amino acid mutations, a serine in CDR1 of the heavy chain of 5M010 is exchanged by an asparagine in 5M012 (Ser31Asn) and an additional amino acid variation is present in the J region of the light chain gene. the 2 clones also share the same light chain clonotype comprising the lambda light chain gene segment IGLV1\u201347. preliminary data showed no difference between 5M010 and 5M012, all shown results were restricted to 5M012. the third clonotype is represented by 5M002 comprising the IGKV1\u201339 kappa light chain and the IGHV4\u201359 heavy chain V gene segments. the variable heavy and light chain gene sequences of AIN457 and ixekizumab are shown in the alignment. the 4 anti-IL17A antibodies were analyzed for binding to human IL17A by ELISA. AIN457 was used as a benchmark antibody and showed an EC50 value for binding to IL17A.

ELISA-based comparison of IL17A binding of patient-derived antibodies 5M002, 5M007, 5M012, 5M024, benchmark antibody AIN457, and an irrelevant IgG1. the affinities reported here are an underestimation of the real affinities. the reference antibody AIN457 showed a mean KD value of 133 51pM. similar KDs have been determined for 5M002 and ixekizumab. ng/ml IL17A in the presence of serial dilutions of anti-IL17 autoantibodies. a dose dependent neutralization of IL17A, and hence decrease in IL17A-dependent IL6 expression of HFF-1 cells, was observed. all antibodies were assessed using nonlinear regression (log inhibitor versus response) both benchmark antibodies, AIN457 and ixekizumab IgG1, efficiently neutralized IL17A activity with IC50 values of 0.43 0.18 nM and 0.19 nM 0.019 nM. the 2 antibodies derived from the same heavy chain, clones 5M007 and 5M024, both neutralized IL17A with an IC50 of 0.16 0.03 nM. 4 IL17A autoantibodies, 5M002, 5M007, 5M012 and 5M024, all showed binding to recombinant human IL17A in ELISA. all identified antibodies showed IL17A neutralization activity in the range of the 2 benchmark antibodies, AIN457 and ixekizumab. supernatants from cells incubated in the presence of control plasma showed a 4.7-fold increase of IL17A-induced IL6. those incubated with patient-derived plasma showed no increase in IL6 production. 96 single cells were sorted into wells containing uninfected BHK cells. out of 96 wells, 59 showed signs of viral infection. 91.5% of the analyzed wells showed cells with varying degrees of IL17A binding. 5M001 5M019 5M034 5M007 5M003 5M020 5M015 5M055 5M035 5M010 5M002 5M027 5M057 5M033 5M022 5M037 5M008 5M004 5M053 5M012 5M041 5M023 5M039 5M009 5M005 5M058 5M049 5M031 5M scFv-huFc-1 antibodies were cloned and expressed in HEK-293T cells as human fusion proteins. the remaining 19 scFv-huFc-1 antibodies were subject to intermediate scale expression in serum-free medium for further analyses. a dose response assay was performed by stimulating HFF-1 cells with serial dilutions of IL17A and quantifying the concentration of IL6 in culture supernatants. a measurable IL6 response was observed at an IL17A concentration as low as 1 ng/ml, whereas saturation was reached at approximately 1 g/ml. to measure neutralization by antibodies, an IL17A concentration of 50 ng/ml in the linear range of the dose response a mouse monoclonal anti-IL17 antibody67 from R&D Systems neutralized IL17A activity with IC50s of 2.6 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. a second clonotype, represented by clones 5M010 and 5M012, had IC50s of 51 pM and 24 pM, respectively. the 5 most promising clones, 5M002, 5M007, 5M010, 5M012 and 5M024, were therefore selected for cloning and expression as human IgG1. the 2 clones share the same light chain clonotype comprising the lambda light chain gene segment IGLV1\u201347. rine in the heavy chain of 5M010 is exchanged by an asparagine in 5M012 (Ser31Asn) an additional amino acid variation is present in the J region of the light chain gene. preliminary data showed no difference between 5M010 and 5M012, all shown results were restricted to 5M012. 5M002, 5M007, 5M010 5M012, 5M024 and of benchmark antibodies AIN457 and ixekizumab. sequences are numbered starting at the first amino acid of mature Ig heavy chain protein.

AIN457 and ixekizumab IgG1 effectively neutralized IL17A activity. a large set of unpurified human fusion proteins in HEK-293T cell culture supernatants showed binding to recombinant human IL17A in vitro. the 4 clones representing 3 clonotypes for expression as human IgG1 showed binding to recombinant human IL17A in ELISA. all identified antibodies showed potent neutralizing activity in the range of the 2 benchmark antibodies, AIN457 and ixekizumab AIN457 and ixekizumab, a humanized IgG4 mAb, were used in this study as benchmark antibodies because they are currently undergoing evaluation in Phase 3 clinical trials. the mAb was generated by immunization of transgenic mice engineered to express the human IgG/ repertoire. IgG1 was less potent than the scFv-huFc-1, with differences ranging from 2.3-fold in the case of 5M024 to 14-fold in the case of 5M012. the reduced potency of the IgG1 format may be due to an inherent pH-dependent lability of the antigen binding site. AIN457 was determined to be about 5-fold higher in IL17A neutralization assays. the observed differences may be due to the IL17A-responsive cell line used or other differences in the assay set-up. the 2 single amino acid differences in the variable light chain did not affect potency. anti-IL17A autoantibodies can be readily isolated from selected patients. no fungal infections have been reported following the use of ixekizumab. beads were combined and incubated for 1 hour with subject or control plasma at 1:100 dilution. fluorescence intensity for each bead type was plotted as a function of antibody titer. 5 105 cells were cultured for 48 hours, media removed and replaced with complete DMEM containing either 10% control or patient plasma. culture supernatants were harvested and analyzed for IL17A-induced IL6 levels. expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. insoluble inclusion bodies were first washed with wash buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 M urea) then with wash buffer 2 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 antibody screening by mammalian cell display Human antibodies were isolated using methods described previously. 107 PBMCs were stained for the presence of anti-IL17A cell surface immunoglobulin and various cell surface markers. 40 IgM/IgD/CD3/CD14-negative, CD19/anti-IL17A-positive cells were sorted on a FACSAria\u00ae III flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) scFv-fc antibodies Fusion proteins were generated carrying an N-terminal human scFv fused to a C-terminal human Fc-1 domain. so, scFv coding regions were digested with the restriction endonuclease SfiI and cloned into the expression vector pCEP-SP-Sfi-huFc-1. plasmids drive expression of scFv-hu expression of AIN457 and ixekizumab was done by transfecting the expression vector into HEK-293T cells, using Lipofectamin Plus. after 3 days, the medium was replaced by fresh, serum-free medium. four days later, the serum-free culture supernatants were harvested, passed through 0.22 m sterile filters, and stored at 4\u00b0C. 5M002, 5M007 and 5M012 were cloned into pEX1 via recombination using the in-fusion\u00ae HD Cloning Plus Kit. the resulting fragments were flanked by sequences, allowing recombination into the linearized pEX1-kappa plasmid. sequences, expression and purification were performed as described for AIN457 and ixekizumab. variable light (V, V) and heavy (VH) chain gene specific primers used for cloning of 5M002, 5M007 and 5M012. plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat F(ab')2 anti-human Fc antibody. plates were then washed with PBS/0.05% Tween\u00ae20 and blocked for 2 h with 3% BSA in PBS/0.05% Tween\u00ae20. plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with 3-fold serial dilutions of culture supernatants.
