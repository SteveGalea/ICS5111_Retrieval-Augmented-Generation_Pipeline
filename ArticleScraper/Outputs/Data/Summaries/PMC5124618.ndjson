{"summary": "scientists and health officials have warned that we must prepare for a potentially devastating global pandemic of an infectious disease. initial concern was focused on the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. more recently, people in west africa have endured a devastating outbreak of Ebola virus disease. the study by van Vught et al. adds to our understanding of the many mechanisms involved in the host response to infection. it provides scientific explanation for what happens, yet offers no guidance on how to improve outcomes in patients with pneumonia, sepsis and other forms of critical illness. propensity-matched observational studies of Mortensen and colleagues (3,4) studied patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia who had been treated with statins and angiotensin receptor blockers. outpatient treatment with either a statin or an ARB prior to hospitalization was associated with 30% reduction in 30-day all-cause mortality. similar levels of effectiveness in preventing 30-day all-cause mortality were obtained in the previous study for patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. similar levels of effectiveness in preventing 30-day all-cause mortality were obtained in the previous study for patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. endothelial dysfunction and loss of endothelial barrier integrity are central to the pathophysiology of bacterial sepsis and acute lung injury. many systemic virus diseases (13), including dengue and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (15), are also characterized by endothelial dysfunction. changes in the VE response to inflammatory stimuli during sepsis. the resting vascular endothelium is shown on the left in its natural state. this disrupted endothelium expedites the loss of fluid. epithelial cell dysfunction is also a well-known feature of the host response to critical illness. several abnormalities, including a loss of barrier integrity, increased permeability, epithelial apoptosis and increased levels of biomarkers, have been observed in the lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract.

ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus (41-43). soon thereafter, ACE2 was shown to protect mice from acute lung injury associated with experimental sepsis (44) in experimental sepsis, ACE2/ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling down regulates inflammatory changes in endothelial cells (58) this signaling axis reverses endothelial and epithelial cell dysfunction (61-65) and prevents ARDS (66-68) release of Angpt-2 suppresses Tie2 signaling, reduces Foxo-1 phosphorylation and increases Angpt-2 gene transcription. loss of Tie2 signaling leads directly to endothelial dysfunction. in mice its restoration reverses acute lung injury seen with influenza virus infection. treatment with statins and ARBs directly affects the Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis. Akt and increase phosphorylation of Foxo1 decreases Angpt-2 production. endothelial barrier integrity is also enhanced by statin inhibition of Rho and Rac geranylgeranylation (30). ACE2 has been found in alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes in the small intestines, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells in several organs (43). the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling axis modifies several aspects of both acute and chronic inflammation. it has beneficial effects on insulin metabolism (49) and on the cardiovascular (46,50), renal (51), and coagulation systems (52). statins and ARBs have been used to treat patients with sepsis, ARDS, influenza and Ebola virus disease. a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies has led to caution in interpreting the results. study subjects had been statin-naive for at least two weeks, and treatment was started as soon as they were hospitalized. investigators calculated they would need 414 patients to detect a statistically significant reduction in severe sepsis of 15%. the development of multi-organ failure in sepsis patients is thought to be due to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity. studies in cell co-culture systems show that influenza viruses target epithelial rather than endothelial cells (97,101,102) the importance of host factors, not virus replication, was shown conclusively in a study of experimental acute lung injury following intra-tracheal instillation of inactivated H5N1 influenza virus (107) a specific Tie2 agonist (Vasculotide) promotes survival in mice infected with influenza virus (115). studies of statin treatment of influenza virus-infected mice have been inconclusive (117) statins may contribute to improved survival in human influenza because they down regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines. in mice, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling promotes apoptosis in epithelial cells (118), while in humans with acute coronary syndrome, statins reduce endothelial cell apopto in one study from the uk, statin treatment resulted in a 33\u201335% reduction in 30-day all-cause mortality (127), although the proportion of illnesses that were caused by influenza virus infection was unknown. in another study, elderly patients taking statins had reduced antibody responses following influenza vaccination. 470 unvaccinated patients who had not used statins were used as the control group. logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, previous pneumococcal vaccination and influenza season. it is more important to know whether statins benefit patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza. two studies were performed using the same database. both used propensity scoring and the analyses adjusted for age, sex, underlying high-risk conditions and previous influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment. a letter was published online suggesting that statins and/or ARBs might be useful in treating Ebola patients and should be tested (141). a few months later, physicians in Sierra Leone were able to treat consecutively approximately 100 Ebola patients with a combination of atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and irbesartan (143,144) document consecutive treatment of 25 Ebola patients treated in this hospital. none of the treatments had a major effect in improving survival in patients. some investigators insist that the rhesus macaque non-human primate model provides the \u201cgold standard\u201d for testing investigational Ebola treatments. gastrointestinal endothelial dysfunction is so prominent in Ebola virus disease. the lung, liver and kidneys are the primary targets of severe or fatal sepsis, pneumonia and influenza. the complex relationship between the gut and other organs in critical illness has only begun to be explored. the investigators documented activation of the coagulation cascade and evidence of endothelial dysfunction. the findings reflect the increase in vascular permeability that clinicians have long known to be a central feature of Ebola virus disease. statin treatment in sepsis patients was found to be safe in these patients. in one study, patients had been treated with mechanical ventilation for a mean of eight days before statin treatment was begun. another RCT of statin treatment in sepsis patients was conducted by clinicians. both cell types can be infected in vitro with influenza A H5N1 viruses (96-98) and this is associated with a brisk and unbalanced inflammatory response involving NF-kappa B and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 (99,100) studies in cell co-culture systems show that influenza viruses primarily target epithelial rather than endothelial cells (97,101,102) angpt-like 4, a member of the Angpt family that does not signal through Tie2, also promotes vascular permeability in experimental influenza (115). statins reduce influenza virus replication in vitro (116), but for several reasons, studies of statin treatment of influenza virus-infected mice have been inconclusive (117). influenza ah7N9 and similar influenza viruses have served as reminder that the pandemic threat has not disappeared. access to pandemic vaccines will be severely limited for virtually everyone in the world (121,122) 470 unvaccinated patients who had not used statins were used as the control group. statin treatment reduced 30-day all-cause mortality by 41%, suggesting that statins might be useful in treating influenza patients requiring hospitalization. statins should not be used as adjunct treatment for preventing death among persons hospitalized for influenza. findings for statins and ARB treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and those for statin treatment of laboratory-confirmed influenza suggest this conclusion is premature. gene studies of Ebola in mice have shown that endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular permeability are associated with Tie2 (137) most of these experimental findings were published before Ebola-infected health care workers were evacuated to the us and Europe. international organizations involved in the Ebola response, including WHO, have made no effort to validate these findings. individual patient records document consecutive treatment of 25 Ebola patients treated in this hospital, all of whom survived. simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in two NHP species. clinical outcomes are very different in rhesus macaques compared with sooty mangabeys. both species have similarly high virus loads. apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells is a common finding in human and animal studies of critical illness. it is tempting to speculate that the response of Ebola patients to combination statin/ARB treatment might have been due to the favorable effects of ARBs on ACE2 in intestinal epithelial cells. diseases associated with all but one of the emerging viruses requiring urgent research and development (R&D) are characterized by endothelial dysfunction (42,182-185), and it is a feature of several diseases thought to represent bioterrorist threats, including inhalation anthrax (32,187). a trial of a TLR4 antagonist failed in patients with severe sepsis (190,191) an exploratory RCT of aspirin treatment of patients at risk of developing ARDS was abandoned because treatment was ineffective. many factors could explain why these trials were disappointing, including a low level of severe disease and mortality in the patient populations being studied. treatment that target the infecting virus often bring modest benefits at best. these diseases involve similar or overlap mechanisms related to endothelial dysfunction. drugs like statins and ARBs may be used to treat emerging virus diseases. some of these diseases occur only occasionally, but others are far more common. treatment with an antimalarial drug combined with either angopoietin-1 (210) or an ARB (irbesartan) (211) restores endothelial barrier integrity. these clinical and experimental findings suggest adjunctive treatments targeting endothelial dysfunction might improve outcomes in patients with severe and cerebral malaria (198,199) treatment with all four antimalarials, either alone or in combination, had no effect on survival. artesunate (but not mefloquine) improved survival by a mechanism that was independent of its antimalarial activity (216) four independent \u201clessons learned\u201d reports offer overlapping recommendations on how to structure a better WHO and international response for managing future epidemics. each report recommends strengthening national health systems and reorganizing and improving WHO\u2019s governance and capacity to respond to emergencies. the PPDC would seek the participation of national regulatory authorities, industry, research organizations, and other public and private stakeholders. two reports suggest this effort would cost at least $1 billion per year (223-225) none of the reports mentions the statins/ARB experience in Sierra Leone and what it might mean for clinical trials of treatments that target the host response. ISARIC developed a set of pre-approved and adaptable syndrome-based protocols for clinical trials that are available online to its member networks in africa and beyond. these developments address many of the administrative, regulatory, legal and ethical difficulties that could otherwise impede a rapid research response during future outbreaks. all of these issues became evident during the recent Ebola clinical trials. historical observations show that the effects of many treatments can be so dramatic that bias can be ruled out (235); in these instances, \u201cthe observations speak for themselves\u201d (236). simulation studies show that implausibly large associations, both between treatment and confounding factor and between confounding factor and outcome, are generally required to explain risks beyond relative rates of 5\u201310. statin/ARB treatment experience should be evaluated and the findings independently validated. the dimensions of post-Ebola syndrome also need to be defined. investigators should not overlook the possibility that statins, ARBs and drugs like clomiphene could be useful in treating post-Ebola complications seen in these patients. cellular targets for influenza antiviral intervention include (I) the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase and p38 MAPK kinase pathways and (II) the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway. cell culture studies of several unlicensed agents that down regulate these pathways have given promising results (248) a group of investigators has taken up the challenge of \u201crethinking strategies\u201d for clinical trial design by contrasting \u201clumpers\u201d and \u201csplitters\u201d (260). a group of investigators has taken up the challenge of \u201crethinking strategies\u201d for clinical trial design by contrasting \u201clumpers\u201d and \u201csplitters\u201d (260). biomarkers must be rapid, highly accurate and inexpensive. it is not clear whether an approach to treatment discovery that is based on \u201cprecision\u201d or \u201cpersonalized\u201d medicine will in any practical sense meet their needs. cellular mechanisms that support virus replication are still the focus of new research strategies, including drug repurposing. if new antivirals must be specific for each individual virus, this approach to research has many disadvantages. this approach would minimize the possibility of virus resistance, would work only in virus-infected cells. biomarkers can be used to define patients with different immune response states and prognosis. they can be used to define patient subgroups that show greater immunosuppression and higher mortality. they are also said to be more precise than definitions based on clinical criteria alone. investigators propose three strategies to improve clinical trial design. practical enrichment, prognostic enrichment and predictive enrichment. they believe that \u201cdifferent treatments require different target populations\u201d (260) evaluators of research proposals systematically downgrade those that seek to explore new ideas. a propensity for \"cognitive cronyism\" tends to exclude new ideas from consideration. a propensity for \"cognitive cronyism\" tends to exclude new ideas from consideration. these treatments work in patients with several types of critical illness. the relevance of this approach is based on existing knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms shared by all of these viruses and how these mechanisms are affected by treatment. AMPK acts as a master regulator of cellular energy balance by maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis (275). AMPK is up regulated by statins (282) and ARBs (278). the international response to the Ebola crisis has been widely criticized for failure to develop vaccines and treatments that could have mitigated its devastating impact. if newly developed antiviral drugs have broad-spectrum activity, they will still be expensive, in limited supply, and unfamiliar to most physicians. however, they might be no more effective than the agents that were tested against Ebola (150-154) a conference held in November 2015 considered the lessons that should be learned from the Ebola crisis. the threat of emerging virus diseases that could cause epidemics and pandemics is ongoing, but preparedness efforts have been and will continue to be inadequate. Developing specific treatments that target each emerging virus disease will be complex, difficult, and unlikely to succeed A \u201cbottom up\u201d approach to treating common features of the host response to emerging virus infections is possible. research needed to study this approach to treatment does not require \u201ctop down\u201d international coordination. many reports show it could be undertaken by individual scientists or groups of investigators, many of whom could and should come from low- and middle-income countries."}
