{"summary": "signaling by single-pass CAMs belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily remains a mystery. x-ray crystallography must be complemented by other methods that give information on individual molecules in large populations. cell motility (Ebrahimnejad et al., 2004; Klaile et al., 2005; M\u00fcller et al., 2005), apoptosis (Kirshner et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2005), tumor growth (Leung et al., 2008), invasion (Ebrahimnejad et al., 2004), infection, and inflammation (Gray-Owen and Blumberg homophilic binding properties of CEACAM1 ectodomains were analyzed by flow cell biosensor analysis. rat D(1\u20134) proteins bound specifically to immobilized rat D(1\u20134) but not to rat D(2\u20134) ligands. no explicit binding of the rat D(2\u20134) constructs was observed. rat and human CEACAM1 D(1\u20134)-Fc proteins were immobilized at a level of 7,100 response units (RU) five concentrations of rat D(1\u20134)-His were analyzed in HBS/P20/3 mM EDTA (A) or HBS/P20/2 mM Ca2+/2 mM Mg2+ (B) are shown as black data points. three different reaction schemes were developed: formation of one class of dimers by one homophilic binding site (model 1); formation of two classes of dimers (types 1 and 2) by two different homophilic binding sites (model 2); formation of two classes of dimers (types 1 and 2) and one class of trimers by two different homophilic binding sites (model 3). model 3 gave acceptable standard deviations but indicated that the formation of type 2 dimers was almost insignificant. model 1 gave the best fit to the experimental values with the lowest 2. ka1 = 0.0890 0.0034 M1s1; kd1 = 0.6806 0.0074 s1; kD1 = 7.65 M; ka2 = 0.0000598 0.0000033 M1s1; kd2 = 0.01241 0.00038 s1; and KD2 = 208 M. the recombinant CEACAM1 D(1\u20134) ectodomain was polydisperse as a result of varying degrees of glycosylation. gray-level thresholding and SWS returned the same particles. the threshold was 1,000 voxels. all volumes 500 voxels were identified as background noise. gray-level thresholding compared two monomer and two dimer particles. bars, 5 nm. and 50 nm. Ig domains have two faces consisting of closely opposed sheets of strands. Fig. 3 B shows two unglycosylated CEACAM5 D1 domains in close contact via their ABED faces. it is believed that this represents a physiological interaction because the ABED surface is highly hydrophobic. two D1 domains of human CEACAM1 (PDB accession no. 2GK2) in the asymmetric unit in contact via their ABED faces. bars, 2.5 nm. (D) Ribbon model of the human CEACAM1 D1 domain shown at three different angles to visualize the C\u2032\u2032C\u2032CFG and the ABED sheets. ectodomains were classified as extended monomers (mono e), kinked plus back-folded monomers (mono k+bf), C-dimers (di C), A-dimers (di A), kinked plus back-folded monomers (mono k+bf), ectodomains. ectodomains were classified as extended monomers (mono e), kinked plus back-folded differences in each ectodomain class compared with D(1\u20134) (Ca/Mg) populations were analyzed by two-proportion z test. a striking feature was the structural variability of the ectodomains. many shapes were observed, including extended (Fig. 4, A and B), kinked (Fig. 4 C), and completely back-folded molecules (Fig. 4 D). two ectodomains were closely associated in a parallel manner. the third molecule was bound via its larger Ig domain to one of the larger end domains of the parallel A-dimer. the binding domain must be one of the D1 domains. all four Ig domains can participate in parallel, in-register cis-dimerization. antiparallel trans-binding is mediated by the D1 domain alone. molar concentrations of monomers, C-dimers, A-dimers, and trimers could be calculated. rat CEACAM1 ectodomains anchored to nickel\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) liposomes induced adhesion. inability of D(2\u20134) to mediate adhesion confirms previously published data that domain D1 mediates trans-homophilic binding. 85% of the molecules occurred in dimers and clusters (Fig. 6, H and I) however, smaller cluster sizes including up to four molecules were favored. membrane attachment altered monomer/oligomer equilibrium. the differences in each cluster class compared with D(1\u20134) (free) populations were analyzed by a two-proportion z test. bridging two membranes were analyzed by a two-proportion z test. cross-linking of CEACAM1 D(1\u20134)-His and D(2\u20134)-His (C) were cross-linked with BS3 in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM Ca2+, 2.5 mM Mg2+, 3 mM EDTA, and Ni-NTA liposomes at a high. cross-linking of D(1\u20134) in solution resulted in stabilization of dimers, trimers, tetramers the samples were analyzed by Western blotting for CEACAM1 monomers/dimers/multimers. the black line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out. t test was made with reference to cross-linked protein with no extra additions. the homophilic binding properties of CEACAM1 ectodomains were analyzed by flow cell biosensor analysis. rat D(1\u20134) proteins bound specifically to immobilized rat D(1\u20134) but not to rat D(2\u20134) ligands. five concentrations of rat D(1\u20134)-His were immobilized at a level of 7,100 response units (RU) five concentrations of rat D(1\u20134)-His (0.36\u20131.79 g/l, corresponding to 4.4\u201322.2 M monomer) were analyzed in HBS/P20/3 mM EDTA (A) or HBS/P20/2 mM Ca2+/2 mM Mg2+ (B) are shown as the formation of type 1 and type 2 dimers is characterized by a set of kinetic rate constants, ka1/kd1 and ka2/kd2 respectively. the number of free-running parameters were the same in models 2 and 3. analysis according to model 3 gave acceptable standard deviations. these results demonstrate that CEACAM1 D(1\u20134) ectodomains participate in two different, simultaneously occurring homophilic binding reactions. soluble rat CEACAM1 ectodomains containing all four Ig domains, D(1\u20134), or lacking the N-terminal Ig domain, D(2\u20134) were determined by molecular electron tomography. a large number of smaller background structures with volumes up to 500 voxels were recorded by both approaches. the buffer controls showed no particles of or above the size of CEACAM1 ectodomains. crystallographic structures of mouse CEACAM1 (Tan et al., 2002), human CEACAM1 (Fedarovich et al., 2006), and human CEACAM5 (Fig. 3, A\u2013C; Korotkova et al., 2008). the two tandem domains of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 are very similar both in their primary and 3D structures. both structures (Fig. 3, B and C) are compact yet allow recognition of the contacting interfaces even at 20- resolution. both of the structures are compact yet allow recognition of the contacting interfaces even at 20- resolution. 20 different, extended monomeric D(1\u20134) domains were divided into four equally long segments. this showed that one end had a significantly larger mean diameter than the other end in all molecules. this showed that one end had a significantly larger mean diameter than the other end in all molecules. the ectodomains were classified as extended monomers (mono e), kinked plus back-folded monomers (mono k+bf), C-dimers (di C), A-dimers (di A), and trimers (tri) the differences in each ectodomain class compared with D(1\u20134) (Ca/Mg) populations were analyzed by two-proportion z test. the most common type was fully or partly extended dimers held together only by reciprocal binding between the largest end domains. the most common type was fully or partly extended dimers held together only by reciprocal binding between the largest end domains. more than 90% of the truncated D(2\u20134) ectodomains appeared as extended (Fig. 4 I) or more condensed, kinked monomers. some dimers occurred (Fig. 4 K) but no trimers. the KD for the monomer/A-dimer binding was 113 M and 260 M in Ca/Mg and EDTA respectively. this shows that both types of dimers can form in the presence and absence of divalent cations, but that both dimerization reactions were enhanced by the divalent cations. the homophilic binding affinity leading to C-dimer formation was significantly higher than that for A-dimer formation. the rate and extent of D(1\u20134)-mediated liposome aggregation increased with increasing protein/liposome ratio. electron tomography revealed the presence of CEACAM1 ectodomains on free-liposome surfaces. monomeric bridges (C-dimers) connecting two liposomes (L1 and L2) are shown at two angles. in the colored panels, D1\u2013D1 contact zones are indicated by a black dotted line. in the colored panels, D1\u2013D1 contact zones are indicated by a black dotted line. clusters containing several D(1\u20134) ectodomains were resolved. the ectodomains were kinked to variable degrees. in many bridges, a large part of the individual ectodomains was oriented parallel to the lipid membrane. cross-linking of CEACAM1 D(1\u20134)-His and D(2\u20134)-His (C) were cross-linked with BS3 in the presence of 2.5 mM Ca2+, 2.5 mM Mg2+, 3 mM EDTA, and Ni-NTA liposomes. CAM1 ectodomains at high D(1\u20134)/liposome ratio revealed a significant increase in the level of dimers and a decrease of higher order oligomers that was not statistically significant. at low D(1\u20134)/liposome ratio, the level of the D(1\u20134) dimers was similar to that of nonliposome-bound CEACAM1, whereas the higher oligomers disappeared almost completely (Fig. 7, A and B) all three methods revealed a partial dependence of divalent cations. both dimerization reactions were enhanced. extracellular Ca/Mg should contribute to formation of CEACAM1-mediated cell adhesion. overestimation of the proportion of A-dimers in the tomograms would mean that some of the parallel dimers that we classified as A-dimers were in fact C-dimers in which the physical binding only was mediated by domain D1. another contributing factor might be that the formation of A-dimers, which we treated as one single reaction, is in reality composed of four cooperative reactions in which all of the four Ig domains participate. bridging clusters were smaller and had different molecular packing compared with free-surface clusters. cross-linking results indicated that antiparallel C-dimers mediating cell\u2013cell adhesion are not stabilized by amine-reactive cross-linkers. cross-linked dimers should exclusively represent parallel A-dimers. cross-linked multimers formed by the D(1\u20134) ectodomains are clearly caused by the presence of domain D1 because no complexes larger than dimers were formed by D(2\u20134) under any conditions. these multimers most likely form because of the flexibility of the ectodomains. a corresponding increase of cross-linked D(2\u20134) A-dimers did not occur. the enhanced A-dimer formation was most likely a function of D1-mediated, antiparallel (trans) C-dimerization because it only occurred at the higher protein/liposome ratio. it was not simply a result of increased local concentration of CEACAM1 ectodomains in the membrane contact regions. the exact location of the other binding site in relation to the CFG face is unknown. the finding of two unglycosylated CEACAM1 D1 domains in the asymmetric crystal unit might indicate that this could represent the second binding site. however, in the asymmetric crystal unit, this surface was covered by the oligosaccharide N linked to Asn-70. the N-terminal domain of CD2 has been shown to be in a metastable state. this can result in exchange of strands between the domains in a CD2-dimer. this can result in a dimeric structure in which each domain is formed by the intercalation of two polypeptide chains. ectodomains would be transmitted via transmembrane domains. this could influence binding/activation of SH2 domain\u2013carrying enzymes. this could in turn influence binding/activation of SH2 domain\u2013carrying enzymes. this could in turn influence binding/activation of SH2 domain\u2013carrying enzymes. rat D(1\u20134)-His vector was amplified by homologous recombination. rat D(2\u20134)-His vector was inserted by homologous recombination. rat and human CEACAM1 D(1\u20134)-Fc and rat CEACAM1 D(2\u20134)-Fc were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling at pH 4.0. all interaction analyses were performed at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of 20 l/min in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Hepes (Hepes-buffered saline [HBS]), pH 7.4 and 0.005% kD and a frictional ratio (f/f0) of 1.256 were used for D(1\u20134)-His. kD and a frictional ratio (f/f0) between 1.256 and 1.43 did not result in significant differences of the association/dissociation constants. the
