{"summary": "the Bioethical Implications of Globalization Project is a 42-month dialogue funded by the European Commission. the project's purpose is both to raise short-term, practical considerations about globalization and health and to provide a longer-term, strategic perspective on the four selected public health\u2013related issues. the Delphi Method Delphi is a group communication technique designed to obtain opinions from a panel of selected experts on specific issues through the sending of questionnaires to be completed within a specified time. participants do not meet personally, thereby avoiding undue influence. the process ends with analysis of the answers and formulation of the final report. international travel may contribute to the spread of infectious diseases across borders. this commerce is likely to increase as the EU enlarges to include eastern and central European nations. such commerce may include the movement of health providers from East to West. poverty and social disparities are key factors in the growth of global migration. it is timely to consider whether mobility is a human right, and if those who migrate have rights to health care in their new country. there is considerable ambiguity as to the value of technological globalization. genetic testing could provide predictive information on a population basis that could aid future health care planning. genetic testing could provide predictive information on a population basis that could aid future health care planning. the identification of genetically \u201chigh-risk\u201d individuals would likely interfere with their autonomy. health inequalities may be amplified between those with access and those without access to health care. populations-based genomic research may characterize groups of people in such a way that encourage discrimination. such research may lead to disputes about ownership of genetic resources from participants populations. a Purchasing Power Parity of US$3,000 per capita per year may not be affected by the increase in Purchasing Power Parity. low-intensity technological improvement rather than economic growth may be more important to health in rich countries compared with developing countries. concerns for intellectual property rights in trade have been an extraordinarily contentious issue in recent years. the agreement has been criticized by some, who claim it increases privatization of health care services and undermines public health care systems. social justice, equity, beneficence, and nonmaleficence will all come into play in the implementation of this treaty. some question the enormous sums being spent to address the perceived threats due to bioterrorism even without strong evidence for actual threats. global bioethical challenges require careful theoretical deliberation and practical considerations for international health policies. the BIG Project has found that bioethical principles are important in considerations of migration, trade, information technology, genomics, and bioweapons threats."}
