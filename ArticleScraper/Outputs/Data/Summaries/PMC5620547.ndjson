{"summary": "there is no safe and effective vaccine to prevent RSV. previous vaccination approaches using formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) were associated with an increased risk of serious RSV illness upon subsequent natural infection. anti-RSV G prophylaxis or treatment reduces pulmonary mucus production, inhibits infection-induced airway dysfunction and reduces pulmonary cell infiltration in response to RSV infection. understanding the role of the G protein CX3C motif in both innate and adaptive immune responses is important to developing RSV G protein-based vaccines. Calu-3 cells polarize into apical and basolateral surfaces in trans-well culture systems. but do not differentiate into multiple cell types in contrast to cultured normal human bronchoepithelial (NHBE) cells. polarized, liquid-covered cultured Calu-3 cells are susceptible to RSV infection. lone, ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were kept in monolayer cultures in T-75 cm2 flasks in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 mM HEPES. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 were amplified from the supernatant of transfected cells by serial passage on vero cells. rA2-GC12 contains Cys to Ser point mutations at a.a. 173 and 176. rA2-GC4 mutant is thus a CCR variant while rA2-GC4 mutant is a true CX3C mutant. total cellular RNA was extracted from polarized Calu-3 cells with sterile Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline. expression of the RSV matrix (M) gene was determined using primers (forward, position 3257-3282) 5\u2032-GGC AAA TAT GGA AAC ATA GCT GAA-3\u2032 and (reverse, position 3312-3340) 5\u2032-TCT TTT TCT AGG ACA TAY TGA ACA G cell monolayers were overlaid with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.5% methylcellulose. plaques enumerated by immunostaining with murine monoclonal antibodies against RSV G protein and RSV F proteins. total RNA was isolated using PureLink\u00ae RNA purification kit (Invitrogen) transfected cells were fixed with 4% Formalin in PBS. cells were blocked overnight in 5% Blotto in PBS. cells were stained with rabbit anti-CX3CR1 antibodies labelled with allophycocyanin. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 were amplified from the supernatant of transfected cells by serial passage on Vero cells. rA2-GC12 contains Cys to Ser point mutations at a.a. 173 and 176 while rA2-GC4 contains a Cys to Ser point mutation at a.a. 186. analysis of the RSV F gene revealed changes in 2 amino acids between RSV A2 and the rA2 recombinant viruses, K66E and Q101P [49] the observed mutations are located in variable regions of the F protein within the A strain of RSV [50] these strains were propagated in vero cells as described [48], and determined to be mycoplasma free. real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a Stratagene Mx3000 detection system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) dilutions of known PFUs of RSV A2 RNA were used to obtain a standard curve. u-3 cells mock-infected and cells infected with rSV A2, rA2-GC12 or rA2-GC4 viruses for various time points were isolated using PureLink\u00ae RNA purification kit (Invitrogen) total RNA was quantified using nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer and DNAse treated. equal amount of DNA free RNA (1 g) was polyadenylated and reverse transcribed using high sensitivity miRNA cDNA synthesis kit the percentage of CX3CR1 positive cells was determined after counting 20,000 independent events in each treatment in triplicate. differences were considered significant at p 0.05. differences in infectivity of RSV A2 vs rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses were determined using trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) over a period of 56 days. rA2-GC4 infection results in a decline of polarized Calu-3 cells. the organization of the CCR influences RSV infectivity and the degree of pathogenicity or virulence. the rA2-GC4 and rA2-GC12 peptides are folded similarly. mutations in the CX3C motif in rA2-GC4 affect folding patterns of the cysteine noose. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses replicate poorly in polarized liquid covered culture (LCC)-Calu3 wells. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses replicate poorly in polarized liquid covered culture (LCC)-Calu3 wells. IFN and SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression were evaluated at 12 h and 24 h following mock, rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 infections. expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 was significantly upregulated in rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 infected cells relative to RSV A2. expression of IFN1, IFN, SOCS-1 and SOC-3 were determined by gene specific primer-probe combinations using a one-step qRT-PCR assay at 12 h (a) or 24 h (b) pi Data represent SEM of three independent experiments. ** indicates statistical significance (p 0.01) and **** indicates statistical significance (p 0.001) polarized LCC Calu-3 cells at ALI were infected with RSV/A2, rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 (MOI = 1.0) rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses have the RSV/A2 backbones. differences in infectivity of RSV A2 vs rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses were determined using trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) over a period of 56 days. rA2-GC4 infection results in a decline of polarized Calu-3 cells. loss of TEER was not as pronounced for rA2-GC12 infected cells relative to mock until 28 days pi. the organization of the CCR influences RSV infectivity and the degree of pathogenicity or virulence. mutations in the G protein CCR of the recombinant viruses affected virus replication. RNA was determined at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h pi RSV A2 infection. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses are able to infect, but unable to replicate, as efficiently as the parent A2 strain. IFN and SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression were evaluated at 12 h and 24 h following mock, rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 infections. expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 was significantly upregulated in rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 infected cells. total RNA was isolated from mock and infected cells at 12 h and 24 h pi. expression of IFN1, IFN, SOCS-1 and SOC-3 was determined by gene specific primer-probe combinations using a one-step qRT-PCR assay. the central conserved region (CCR) of RSV G protein alters miRNA expression. expression of let-7f (a) and miR-24 (b) was determined using a miRNA specific forward oligo and a universal oligo relative to 18S. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC12 virus infection led to loss of polarization in Calu-3 cells. the replication kinetics of both viruses were substantially reduced relative to wildtype RSV A2. rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 viruses were also examined. expression of let-7f and miR-24 in rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 infected cells was not statistically different from RSV A2 infection at the 2 h and 12 h time-points. expression was significantly reduced in rA2-GC4 infected cells relative to RSV A2 infection at 24 h pi. rA2-GC4 infection of Calu-3 cells was associated with an accelerated decline in TEER in polarized Calu-3 cells. rA2-GC12 is a recombinant virus containing CysSer mutations in positions 173 and 176 of RSV G protein that is predicted to affect the formation of both disulfide bonds of the cysteine noose. the differences in viral mRNA detected in Calu-3 cells at 15 min to 72 h pi with RSV-A2, rA2-GC12 and rA2-GC4 reveal that the differences in TEER do not correlate with differences in RSV entry or early replication in Calu-3 cells. however, it is possible that the mutations impact virus internalization, packaging or release. mutations of the recombinant viruses disrupt the ability of RSV G protein to signal through these pathways. RSV G protein regulates the early expression of miRNAs after infection or treatment of cells with purified RSV G protein. it is also possible that the RSV G protein CX3C motif regulates miRNA expression in response to infection."}
