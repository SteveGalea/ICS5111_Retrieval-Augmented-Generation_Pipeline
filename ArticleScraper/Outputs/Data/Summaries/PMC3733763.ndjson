{"summary": "in 2002, the institute of medicine reported that the public health system in the united states had a multitude of deficiencies that impact the ability to effectively conduct public health surveillance. these included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. a recent report by Trust for America\u2019s Health found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist surveillance is defined as, \u201cthe systematic and ongoing collection, management, analysis, and dissemination of information for the purpose of informing the actions of public health decision makers.\u201d surveillance is a foundation of emergency preparedness, food safety, infectious disease outbreak prevention and control, chronic disease assessments, and other key areas that protect the health, economy, and security of the public. public health surveillance data is the foundation of public health programs. the significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response. the significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance. rculosis, global, 2011 Droplet (Direct) 8.7 million cases, 1.4 million deaths [24] Projected economic cost of up to $8 billion per year between 2013 and 2015. the values reported in Table 1 do not fully reflect additional indirect costs of diseases and their potentially crippling effects on a community. higher rates of illness, for example, can lead to lower worker productivity [11], while premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor force. the nature of public health surveillance lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience. a lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion and improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and national public health agencies. a lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion and improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and national agencies. attracting and retaining experts in these fields is especially challenging in light of the relatively low base salaries allotted to public health workers. the ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup suggests: Provide training programs for existing and prospective public health workers to equip themselves with the necessary expertise and skills to work in rapidly evolving IT systems. the significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response. the significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response, as well as the cost of inaction. higher rates of illness, for example, can lead to lower worker productivity. premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor force, both of which have economic ramifications. stability and flexibility will depend on the purpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under surveillance. the nature of public health surveillance lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information. a 2004 white house memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies in system acquisitions and usage. collaboration could create opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable disease data for public health use. the ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup proposes approaches to align the surveillance workforce with new demands. a rigorous research and evaluation agenda will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence to inform decision-making. consistent and enterprise-based funding are essential. decision makers can play an active role in advancing population health."}
