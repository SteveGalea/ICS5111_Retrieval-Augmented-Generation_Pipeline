{"summary": "animal studies on high-consequence pathogens must be performed in biosafety level 3 Agriculture (BSL-3-Ag) or BSL-4 facilities that can accommodate large animal research. the challenges are that BSL-3-Ag and BSL-4 facilities are expensive to build, operate and maintain and require a highly trained and consistent workforce. many emerging high-consequence pathogens for agriculture and public health originate in wildlife, including wild pigs, birds, and bats. many emerging high-consequence pathogens for agriculture and public health originate in wildlife, including wild pigs, birds, and bats. several of the agricultural high-consequence pathogens discussed during this workshop are on the Select Agent list. many are also infectious to humans (zoonotic) interactive discussions can take place in roundtables and workshops. the in-person meetings reinforce professional relationships, friendships, and build comradery. a workplace by Facebook was set up as a closed, private group. the workshop questions addressed ongoing efforts to improve the process of bringing a vaccine for a newly-emerging pathogen from virus/bacteria discovery to commercialization in the agriculture sector. the basic and applied areas of development overlap and the basic and applied areas of development overlap. the workshop was transcribed with the ten questions followed by a synopsis of the answers and discussion. the panelists were given time to comment, discuss the topic with each other, and to answer questions from the participants. the order of the questions and synopsis was edited for presentation in this article. deep sequencing is a valuable tool that is becoming more accessible. deep sequencing is a valuable tool that is becoming more accessible. studying host interactions during virus infection is also critical. timeline of the research and development of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine. timeline shows highlights from early FMD discovery to the licensure of a livestock vaccine. the ideal biosurveillance system should have human and animal data together, commercial industry participation, be cloud-based, secure, and offer real-time access. it should also provide incentives for all users that participate and provide data in the system by offering real-time data that provide situational awareness. the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system (NARMS) and AgConnect are good examples of where data sharing is currently being implemented. public and private partnerships have always been important to the department of homeland security science & technology directorate (DHS S&T) and the USDA, Agricultural Research Service at Plum Island (USDA-ARS) the licensing of a new FMD vaccine in 2012 resulted from a successful public-private partnership including DHS S&T, USDA-ARS, and multiple industry partners. a BSL-4 agricultural facility with 24-7 capability to perform comparative animal and vaccine efficacy studies is expensive and requires a consistent and highly-trained workforce. one major aim of this initiative is to enable knowledge sharing by producing a catalog of BSL-4 training opportunities and organizing a laboratory exchange program. establishing a \u2018community of practice\u2019 is necessary to advance research on high-consequence pathogens from discovery to product development and clinical testing. it is perhaps a paradigm shift away from traditional academic models where individual investigators work exclusively on their respective academic or government research programs. there is a transition occurring where stakeholders want demonstrable commitment towards achieving their strategic objectives. international demand for vaccines, drugs and biologics that would also benefit the U.S. increases the ROI for these products, incentivizing earlier investment from industry partners. the research and development history involving Hendra and Nipah viruses serves as a example of where ROI is critical. a need to lower veterinary student debt and introduce students to the variety of rewarding research careers that are available in the government sector. a need to leverage the availability of qualified students that can further train to work in BSL-3-Ag and BSL-4 facilities. the national institutes of health \u2018Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases\u2019 program is a good example of how we can prioritize one health issues. a recent outbreak of avian influenza in Iran led to culling of chickens using standard public health practices. this led to an egg shortage that caused a significant increase in the price of eggs. eminate diagnostic tests and countermeasures that minimize potential impacts of these diseases. deep sequencing is a valuable tool that is becoming more accessible. studying host interactions during virus infection is also critical, especially in understanding how a host can maintain infection asymptomatically. this timeline shows highlights from early FMD discovery to the licensure of a livestock vaccine [7,14,16]. the Friedrich-Loeffler Institut in Riems Germany is the location of the first research work done on foot-and-mouth disease. the ideal biosurveillance system should have human and animal data together, commercial industry participation, be cloud-based, secure, and offer real-time access. it should also have an easy-to-use dashboard with the option for hospital and diagnostic labs to access reports based on various key attributes. the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system (NARMS) and AgConnect are good examples of where data sharing is currently being implemented. the licensing of a new FMD vaccine in 2012 resulted from a successful public-private partnership including DHS S&T, USDA-ARS, and multiple industry partners. other products are also in development via Cooperative Research and Development Agreements. public or private investment for philanthropic reasons is one area where funding is currently increasing for diseases where the ROI may be sub-optimal. a BSL-4 agricultural facility with 24-7 capability to perform comparative animal and vaccine efficacy studies is expensive and requires a consistent and highly-trained workforce. a good example of this is the BSL4ZNet initiative that is designed to increase collaboration between high containment laboratory experts [20]. establishing a \u2018community of practice\u2019 is necessary to advance research on high-consequence pathogens from discovery to product development and clinical testing. it is important for researchers to lead their science and own their part, but also be willing to share. there is a transition occurring where stakeholders want demonstrable commitment towards achieving their strategic objectives and value from their investment. international demand for vaccines, drugs and biologics that would also benefit the united states increases the ROI for these products. this does not eliminate the \u2018valley of death\u2019 for animal health countermeasures, but creates additional opportunities for public-private partnerships. a new range of science for the ecology of disease evolution should be explored. the one health concept brings together human and animal funding sources and it should be robustly promoted. the alignment of federal government funding is important. fectious Diseases\u2019 program is a good example of how we can prioritize one health issues. the overall concept for this workshop was to begin to understand and address the paradox that viewing animal, human, and arthropod disease research as separate, discrete activities. private and non-traditional funding sources are looking for scientific data that includes metrics that enable ROI measurement. veterinarians should be extensively trained in one health topics and take comprehensive coursework in zoonotic disease biology."}
