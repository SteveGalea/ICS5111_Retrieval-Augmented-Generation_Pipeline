{"summary": "raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to serve as carriers for their own genome during cell-to-cell spread and organism-to-organism transmission. they protect the genome (RNA or DNA) during transit, and deliver it into the cytosol or the nucleus of new host cells usually together with accessory proteins. the majority of nonenveloped viruses depend on endocytosis for entry. bacteria can secrete proteins including toxins via a variety of secretion systems. they are classified from I to VII depending on the structure and organization of the secretion machinery. many pathogenic bacteria multiply extracellularly, but it is increasingly recognized that many bacteria that were long considered extracellular can also reside, replicate, or persist inside cells. incoming pathogens enter host cells by endocytosis for replication. entry into cells and replication therein are believed to protect them from circulating antibodies and complement-induced destruction. pathogens have evolved numerous sophisticated mechanisms to counteract these bactericidal processes. incoming viruses cannot manipulate the endocytic machinery by prior delivery of effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells. capsid escape occurs from early endosomes, late endosomes, lysosomes, macropinosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) virus internalized through endocytic processes including macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae, and clathrin- and caveolin-independent mechanisms. pathways followed by influenza A virus, SV40, Uukuniemi virus, and vaccinia virus are shown. early endosome MDCK Matlin et al. 1982; Cureton et al. 2009; Johannsdottir et al. 2009 Influenza A virus Myxoviridae Enveloped ss()RNA Sialic acid containing glycoconjugates pH 5.4. can EGFR pH-independent macropinosome HeLa Krzyzaniak et al. 2013 Ebolavirus Filoviridae Enveloped ss()RNA DC-SIGN. lectins Cathepsins B and C macropinosome 293T Vero Chandran et al. the choice of receptors contributes to the choice of entry mechanism, to species and tissue specificity of infection, to cell tropism, and ultimately to the course of the disease. enveloped viruses bind via spike glycoproteins, whereas nonenveloped viruses attach via fibers, spikes, or surface indentations. a new class of interaction partners on the cell surface has been recognized for viruses. these could be called \u201caccessory factors\u201d because they are primarily needed to activate signaling pathways and thus trigger endocytosis. the interaction of viruses with these can be mediated by adaptors such as Gas6. the physiological role of Gas6 is to serve as a soluble adaptor protein between PS in the membrane of cell remnants after apoptosis and Axl on the surface of cells. viruses use more than one type of receptor either in parallel, in sequence, or when interacting with different cell types. endocytic entry by invasive bacteria is called the trigger mechanism. in epithelial cells, Listeria enters via two internalins. it then resides transiently in a vacuole that is lysed allowing intracytosolic replication. a replicative vacuole is derived from the endocytic vacuole and matures in an ER-derived vacuole. the Legionella vacuole acquires markers of the ER. it is not the case for M. tuberculosis, which blocks maturation of the internalization vacuole. al cells Bastidas et al. 2013 Legionella Type IV secretion system Intravacuolar, pH 6 Macrophages Isberg et al. 2009; Hubber and Roy 2010 Brucella Type IV secretion system Intravacuolar, pH 4 Epithelial cells von Bargen et al. 2012 Coxiella Type IV secretion system Intravacuolar, pH 5 Macrophages Soldati and Neyrolles 2007 Mycobacterium tubercul type IV pili have been implicated in other functions including biofilm formation. a posttranslational modification of the Neisseria meningitidis pilin subunit has been shown to change the conformation of the pilin and lead to loss of interbacterial interactions at sites of adhesion leading to Neisseria dissemination through epithelial cells. a unique situation has been described in the case of enteropathogenic E. coli. these bacteria inject a type III effector called Tir into mammalian cells. Tir mediates the recruitment of several proteins including clathrin, dynamin, and dab2. Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME) is probably the most common mechanism for endocytosis of small and medium-sized viruses. time-lapse movies show two general behaviors. some particles diffuse into preexisting clathrin-coated areas. VSV is cytosed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and penetration occurs in early endosomes. it is unclear whether AP2 is the adaptor protein required for endocytosis. a pathway for virus endocytosis was first described for members of the polyomaviruses: mouse polyoma virus, and SV40. the VP1 proteins that form the icosahedral viral coat bind to the sialic-acid-containing carbohydrate moiety of specific gangliosides. present as 72 homopentamers, VP1 constitutes the main building block in the capsid shell. papilloma virus 16 enters a 3T6 cell via a macropinocytosis-like mechanism. it involves binding to filopodia, surfing along filopodia to the cell body, and activation of an endocytic process independent of clathrin and caveolin. the virus appears to bud into the cell. caveolar endocytosis has been proposed for a variety of viruses. a fraction of the caveolae is mobile and can undergo endocytosis. the best studied among the viral candidates for caveolar uptake is SV40. shRNA- and siRNA-mediated depletion of caveolin-1 results in a decrease in SV40 endocytosis and infection. SV40 can make use of two parallel endocytic mechanisms. one corresponds to the caveolar pathway and relies on caveolin-1. the other is caveolin independent, with the virus particle serving as the curvature-generating principle. macropinocytosis plays a role in the infection of viruses of different families including large viruses such as pox-, filo-, paramyxo, and herpesviruses. some smaller enveloped viruses seem to use pathways that share many properties with macropinocytosis. human papilloma virus 16 (HPV-16) uses a mechanism with similarities to macropinocytosis. some of these characteristics are shared by human rhinovirus 14 and one of the alternate pathways described for influenza A virus. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is probably the most common mechanism for endocytosis of small and medium-sized viruses. time-lapse movies show two general behaviors: assembly of clathrin coat takes longer than for clathrin pit formation during uptake of endogenous protein ligands (1\u20136 min) a new tab Semliki Forest virus is internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles. clathrin-coated vesicles can induce the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. clathrin-coated vesicles can adapt the size of the virus. clathrin-, caveolin-, and dynamin-independent pathway for virus endocytosis was first described for members of the polyomaviruses: mouse polyoma virus, and SV40. VP1 proteins that form the icosahedral viral coat bind to sialic-acid-containing carbohydrate moiety of specific gangliosides that serve as cell-surface receptors. electron micrographs show viruses from different families during endocytic entry. incoming mouse polyoma virus particle is seen in tight-fitting indentation of the plasma membrane of a 3T6 cell. this particle is most likely making use of a clathrin- and caveolin-independent mechanism used by these viruses. virus-containing vesicles formed are delivered to early endosomes. virus is eventually transported via late endosomes to the ER. endocytic role of caveolae in cell life is still poorly defined. addition of SV40 to cells causes dramatic elevation in caveolar vesicle formation and caveolar vesicle motility. shRNA- and siRNA-mediated depletion of caveolin-1 results in a decrease in SV40 endocytosis and infection. SV40 can make use of two parallel endocytic mechanisms. the key events in macropinocytosis include the activation of receptor molecules such as receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, and PS receptors. this triggers downstream signaling cascades resulting in transient, global changes in actin dynamics that lead to cell-wide plasma membrane ruffling. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other growth factor receptors are often activated and essential as accessory factors in infectivity. one of them is human papilloma virus 16 (HPV-16), which in HeLa and HaCaT cells uses a mechanism with similarities to macropinocytosis. endocytic mechanisms described in mammalian cells do not support virus entry. endocytic processes may provide one of the most informative systems for further classification of endocytic processes. bacterial endocytosis of bacteria vary greatly with cell type. listeria monocytogenes is the prototype of a bacterium entering by the zipper mechanism. it expresses two proteins involved in entry: the first, Internalin (inlA), a surface protein that interacts with E-cadherin, a cell\u2013cell adhesion molecule expressed only in some epithelial cells. the first, internalin (inlA), activates the receptor tyrosine kinase Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor integrity of membrane and its lipid rafts is critical for the initial clustering of E-cadherin when bacteria enter by the InlA pathway. in contrast, for the InlB pathway, the integrity of lipid rafts is critical for the correct localization of the phosphoinositides produced in the plasma membrane by PI3 kinase. this leads to the recruitment of Gab1, Cbl, and Shc. actin rearrangements are finally down-regulated by the recruitment of proteins such as cofilin or OCRL a phosphatidyl inositol-5-phosphatase that dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5) P3. clathrin-coated pits serve as a platform for cytoskeletal arrangements. ubiquitination is mediated by the ubiquitin-specific ligase Hakai. caveolin also participates in entry at the site of the InlA E-cadherin entry site. entry of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis into cells resembles that of Listeria. a lower affinity of the integrin for the cytoskeleton could allow higher mobility of the receptors in the membrane. entry requires the concerted activation of growth factor receptors, cytoplasmic kinases, and small GTP kinases. Salmonella and Shigella are two bacteria that use the trigger mechanism to enter cells. the hallmark of this mechanism is the formation of huge, actin-rich membrane ruffles triggered by a signaling cascade that induces localized transient changes in actin dynamics. invasion requires the concerted action of several T3SS effectors to activate tyrosine kinases and Rho GTPases. at least two effectors act as GEFs for Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. salmonella is a motile bacterium. it can adhere to the cell via the SPI-1 T3SS. the binding by Fim is reversible, whereas that mediated by the SPI-1 T3SS is irreversible. this step commits Salmonella to invasion via the translocation of the effectors. Salmonella can also enter cells by a zipper-like mechanism mediated by an outer membrane protein named Rck. it is a Gram-negative bacterium that specifically colonizes the endothelium. it invades and colonizes primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. listeria monocytogenes is the prototype of a bacterium entering by the zipper mechanism. it expresses two proteins involved in entry. the first, Internalin (inlA), is a surface protein that interacts with E-cadherin. it activates the receptor tyrosine kinase Met, the hepatocyte. the integrity of lipid rafts is critical for the correct localization of the phosphoinositides produced in the plasma membrane by PI3 kinase. the ubiquitin ligase Cbl triggers the ubiquitination of Met as a prelude for the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor Dab2 and that of the clathrin heavy and light chains. actin rearrangements are finally down-regulated by the recruitment of proteins such as cofilin or OCRL a phosphatidyl inositol-5-phosphatase that dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5) P3. clathrin depletion prevents actin recruitment suggests coated pits serve as a platform for cytoskeletal arrangements. ubiquitination is mediated by the ubiquitin-specific ligase Hakai. caveolin also participates in entry at the site of the InlA E-cadherin entry site. entry of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis into cells resembles Listeria. a lower affinity of the integrin for the cytoskeleton could allow higher mobility of the receptors in the membrane. the local concentration of PI(4,5)P2 is critical for entry, and Arf6 may have a role in activation of PIP5 kinase, the control of cytoskeleton rearrangements and the closure of the phagocytic cup. chromosomal pathogenicity island (PAI) encodes structural components for the T3SS. bacterial capture by filopodia can be inhibited by antibodies against IpaB and IpaD, two proteins that are located at the tip of the T3SS. invasion requires the concerted action of several T3SS effectors. at least two effectors act as GEFs for Cdc42, Rac, and Rho respectively. Salmonella is a motile bacterium. it can adhere to the cell via the SPI-1 T3SS. the binding by Fim is reversible, whereas that mediated by the SPI-1 T3SS is irreversible. this step commits Salmonella to invasion via the translocation of the effectors. the invasome of bartonella henselae is a Gram-negative bacterium that specifically colonizes the endothelium. it invades and colonizes primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by two distinct routes, either as individual bacteria through a \u201cclassical\u201d endocytic pathway. incoming pathogens enter complex network of heterogeneous but functionally interconnected endocytic vacuoles and vesicles with early endosomes and macropinosomes as commonly used gateways. in early endosomes, the viruses are generally localized in the vacuolar part, sharing this volume with intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) pH threshold is 6 or above, and for late-penetrating viruses it is lower. cues serve as a form of \u201cwake up call\u201d that tell the viruses that they are inside a cell and that it is time for penetration. intracytosolic bacteria use molecular tools to escape from internalization vacuoles. listeria pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O mutants can escape into the cytosol of some human cells. in the cytosol, the bacteria subvert cellular defense mechanisms. the Salmonella-Containing Vacuole replicates in vacuoles with properties of early and late endosomes. the specific characteristics of SCVs are influenced by the SPI-1 T3SS that controls bacterial invasion and the subsequent effects of the SPI-2 T3SS. effectsors SseG and SseF localize the vacuole close to the Golgi apparatus. this may provide the bacteria with nutrients and membrane. sifA also interferes with Rab9-dependent retrograde trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Chlamydia inclusions intercept sphingomyelin- and cholesterol-containing exocytic vesicles. they also interact with multivesicular bodies that can act as a source of sphingolipids and cholesterol. they also interact with mitochondria and lysosomes that may be a source of essential amino acids derived from host protein degradation. Legionella pneumophila encodes SNARE mimics that directly modulate membrane transport. a network of bacterial effectors interact with Rab1 on the vacuolar membrane to tether ER-derived vesicles that remodel the LCV. the vacuole matures into an ER-derived organelle. Brucella vacuoles merge with late endosomes, with the acquisition of the Lamp1 marker, and the vacuolar pH drops to 4. this allows the secretion of effectors that prevent the fusion of BCV with lysosomes where bacteria are killed. recently, a Brucella protein RicA was shown to recruit Rab2. the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vacuole is internalized in macrophages. it has a pH of 6.4 because it lacks the V-ATPase. however, upon activation of the macrophage, the blocking is overcome. se thought to arrest vacuole maturation by producing a high level of PI3P. effectors SseG and SseF localize the vacuole close to the golgi apparatus. this may provide the bacteria with nutrients and membrane. the inclusions interact with several host cell proteins involved in membrane trafficking, fusion, and organelle identity. several Rabs are recruited including Rab6, 11, and 14. Rab6 and 11 facilitate sphingomyelin transport to the inclusions. Legionella prevents fusion of the vacuole in which it resides with endosomal compartments. the vacuole recruits vesicles derived from the ER to create a specialized compartment. Legionella pneumophila encodes SNARE mimics that directly modulate membrane transport. intermediate BCVs are acidic and display proteolytic activity up to 12 h postinfection. expression of dominant-negative Rab7 prevents conversion of the vacuoles into ER-derived organelles and inhibits replication of Brucella. VirB mutants merge with lysosomes where bacteria are killed. bacterium tuberculosis is internalized in macrophages and is able to arrest normal maturation of its phagosome. it has a pH of 6.4 because it lacks the V-ATPase. bacterium is able to adapt transcriptional program to this drop in pH. many invasive bacteria inject effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells to initiate endocytosis and other changes. some viruses carry host cell proteins, ribosomes, nucleosomes, histones, and actin filaments as structural components. endocytosis is not only used for entry but also for intoxication by toxins. development of new therapies against infectious diseases is of utmost importance in a world vulnerable to epidemics and pandemics caused by established and emerging pathogens. pathogens can also be valuable tools in basic and applied biology, including membrane biology, signal transduction, actin-based motility, and so on."}
