{"summary": "pathogens present in ill patients' respiratory secretions can contaminate nearby hospital surfaces, such as floors, walls, bedrails and mattresses. touching contaminated surfaces may lead to nosocomial transmission of pathogens between patients, family caregivers, visitors, and healthcare workers. the lack of routine infection control practices may increase the transmission of respiratory pathogens via hospital surfaces. researchers conducted the study in two public tertiary care teaching hospitals in Rajshahi and Jessore, Bangladesh between September and November 2013. the study was conducted in two public tertiary care teaching hospitals in Rajshahi and Jessore, Bangladesh. research assistants in each hospital collected one swab sample from five different surfaces near each enrolled case patient. the wall next to the patient\u2019s bed, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical record files, and a multipurpose towel. the multipurpose towel is a cloth brought from home by family caregivers and used to clean patient respiratory secretions. both the respiratory swabs and surface swab samples were thawed and the cryovials containing the sample were vortexed. about 200 L of the swab supernatant was used for nucleic acid extraction. the final eluted volume of nucleic acid solution was 200 L. study conducted in two public tertiary care teaching hospitals in Rajshahi and Jessore, Bangladesh between September and November 2013. icddr,b deferred to icddr,b's approval. researchers in each hospital collected one swab sample from five different surfaces near each enrolled case patient. the wall next to the patient\u2019s bed, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical record files, and a multipurpose towel. the multipurpose towel is a cloth brought from home by family caregivers and used to clean patient respiratory secretions. both the respiratory and surface swabs were thawed and the cryovials containing the sample were vortexed. about 200 L of the swab supernatant was used for nucleic acid extraction. the final eluted volume of nucleic acid solution was 200 L. the institutional review board of icddr,b reviewed and approved the study protocol. the median age of patients in the adult wards was 32 years (IQR 25\u201348) and in paediatric wards three months (IQR 2\u20136) two patients, one with Klebsiella pneumoniae and one with Streptococcus pneumoniae detected in their respiratory swabs, had been hospitalized at other facilities within two weeks prior to admission to the study hospital. both these patients had abnormal chest X-rays and were diagnosed with severe pneumonia in the study hospital. the most common bacterial pathogen detected on surface swabs was Klebsiella pneumoniae and 97% of adults (18/30) and 63% (31/49) of pediatric patients. the most common bacterial pathogen detected on surface swabs was Klebsiella pneumoniae. ary care hospitals in Bangladesh, September-November, 2013 tested nearby surfaces for 22 patients without detectable nucleic acid in their respiratory swabs. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses and human rhinoviruses. aphylococcus aureus in 18% (4/22), and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14% (3/22) were rarely detected nearby. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most commonly detected pathogen in patients' respiratory swabs. the most frequently contaminated surfaces were the bed sheet, towel, and bed rail. the predominant bacterial pathogens we identified, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, can survive on surfaces from a few days to a few months. in Bangladesh, hospital surfaces are not adequately cleaned and hospitals report insufficient supplies of cleaning agents. hospital decontamination protocols should include strategies such as daily cleaning of surfaces with disinfectant. a second limitation is that we only sampled surfaces once, which limits our ability to comment on duration of contamination. a third limitation is that we only sampled surfaces once, which limits our ability to comment on duration of contamination. we did not investigate drug resistance patterns of the bacteria we detected on surfaces. this study highlighted the gaps in practice, as well as the substantial barriers to improvement that will require widespread investments to address. in 2018, the directorate of hospital infection control, directorate general of health services (DGHS) has communicated the intention to form infection control committees in each district and tertiary care hospital across the country to improve the safe care."}
