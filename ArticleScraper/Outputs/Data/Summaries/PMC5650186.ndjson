{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. this pathogen is the causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease. EV71 outbreaks have been reported around the world in recent years. EV71 is a process that facilitates the degradation of terminally misfolded, misassembled, and metabolically regulated proteins in the ER by retro-translocating them to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. the process is tightly monitored by the ERQC system, which ensures that only correctly folded and assembled proteins reach their ultimate destination [15,17]. EV71 infection inhibits cellular ERAD processes at multiple key ERAD molecules via its proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro, and ERAD component p97 is involved in EV71 replication. viruses take advantage of ERAD to achieve the membrane penetration of intact viruses from the ER to the cytosol. EV71 infection inhibited cellular ERAD and autophagic degradation are two facets of the host protein quality control system [18]. these biological processes are exploited by various infectious pathogens as survival and proliferation strategies [21,28]. RD cells stably expressing SHH-FLAG (A), NHK-FLAG (B), TTR D18G-FLAG (C) and NS1 LC-FLAG (D) were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for different times. nine hours post-infection the cells were treated with CHX (100 g/ml) for the indicated times. de novo synthesized non-glycosylated forms of SHH-C and NHK were detectable in mock-infected cells, but not EV71 infected cells. de novo synthesized non-glycosylated forms of SHH-C and NHK were detectable in mock-infected cells, but not EV71 infected cells. the degradation of core-glycosylated CD147 (CG) was examined during EV71 infection. this suggests that EV71 infection also inhibited the ERAD of cellular endogenous substrates. we then assessed the location of ERAD substrates in EV71-infected cells. deglycosylated SHH-C is a glycosylated protein that undergoes deglycosylation when retro-translocated to the cytosol. in cells not treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132, the deglycosylated SHH-C was not detected in either mock- or EV71-infected cells. however, when cells were treated with MG132, the deglycosylated SHH-C was visible as a low-mol immunoostaining was performed with antibodies against HA (C and D) or FLAG (E) tag and EV71. a previously reported dislocation-dependent reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay was used to evaluate different substrates. drGFP assay was not used to evaluate substrate NS1 LC. results showed that EV71 infection for 18 h caused apoptosis in 30.4% cells. combined treatment with MG132 in the last 8 h slightly downregulated this proportion. EV71 infection downregulated the expression of several molecules in a time-dependent manner, including Herp, Hrd1, Ubc6e, VIMP, and UBXD8. two bands that seemed like cleavage products of Ubc6e could be detected around 25\u201326 kDa in molecular weight. e 3Cpro cleaved Ubc6e at multiple sites. we investigated whether EV71-encoded viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro participate in this process. this suggests that EV71 3Cpro cleaves Ubc6e during infection. 293T cells were transfected with increasing doses of plasmids encoding GFP-3C or GFP-3C(C147S) at 36 h post-transfection, cells lysates were incubated with 100 or 200 ng/l recombinant 3Cpro or 3C protease-dead mutant 3Cpro(E71A) 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Ubc6e/Ubc6e mutants with or without plasmid encoding GFP-3C. at 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed and cell lysates were incubated with (+) or without Lambda protein phosphatase at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, then the lysates were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against Ubc6e EV71 3Cpro-induced Ubc6e cleavage could inhibit ERAD. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-3C and C-terminal FLAG-tagged Ubc6e. the results showed that the 25\u201326 kDa cleavage bands could be recognized by the Ubc6e antibody but not the FLAG antibody. the cleavage bands from mutant Q219A were shifted to a molecular weight of 30 kDa. this indicates that the 219th glutamine of Ubc6e (Q219) is one of the cleavage sites and that another cleavage site exists that is located closer to the C-terminus of Ubc6e. to further identify the remaining cleavage sites, a new panel of double-site mutants (Q to A) was constructed both the dual-band of Ubc6e and cleaved Ube6e changed to a single-band when treated with phosphatase. EV71 protease 2Apro was responsible for the decreased expression of Herp and VIMP Next. EV71 2Apro inhibits the biosynthesis of Herp and VIMP. RD cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 9 h. then treated with MG132 (50 M), Tg (300 nM), Tg plus MG132, Tun (10 g/ml), Tun plus MG132 for an additional 6 h. BSRT7 cells were transfected with increasing doses of pcDNA3.1-EGFP plasmid or pcDNA3.1-IRES-2A plasmid (1\u20133 g) at 36 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, RNA was extracted, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze VIMP mRNA expression. regulation was reduced by 2/3 in EV71-infected cells. however, there were no differences of basal Herp expression between mock- and EV71-infected cells. this suggests that EV71 may inhibit basal Herp synthesis at the translational level. mRNA expression of VIMP was significantly downregulated in 2A-transfected cells. but not GFP and 2A(C110A)-transfected cells at the protein level. EV71 2Apro also inhibits protein synthesis of VIMP. RD cells stably expressing SHH-FLAG (A), NHK-FLAG (B), TTR D18G-FLAG (C) and NS1LC-FLAG (D) were transfected with control siRNA and siRNA targeting Ubc6e or Herp. western blotting was performed using antibodies against FLAG, Herp, Ubc6e, 2C, and actin. the data are presented as means SD of two independent experiments. the contribution of Ubc6e and Herp to the ERAD of TTR D18G and NS1 LC was validated. the depletion of Ubc6e significantly inhibited the degradation of non-glycosylated TTR D18G. p97 and its ATPase activity are essential for EV71 replication. p97 and its ATPase activity are co-localized with EV71 2C protein. p97 and its ATPase activity are co-localized with EV71 2C protein. cells with p97QQ remarkably attenuated EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner. p97 and its ATPase activity are essential for EV71 replication. at 36 h post-transfection, cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. RD cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or p97QQ-FLAG. at 36 h after transfection, cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. immunostaining was performed to detect intracellular distribution of p97 and EV71 2C. the distribution of p97 had changed significantly in EV71-infected cells. the original evenly distributed pattern had changed to a non-uniform state. p97 co-localized with EV71 2C, suggesting that p97 and 2C jointly participate in EV71 replication. the ROs of picornaviruses have been reported to form at ER-Golgi interface. they use host factors including phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III (PI4KB), ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), and Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) during EV71 infection. p97 and 2C co-localize with PI4KB, ARF1 and GBF1 on viral replication organelles. at 36 h post-transfection, cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. cells were then fixed and stained with mouse anti-p97 and rabbit anti-PI4KB/ARF1/GBF1 antibodies. electron microscopy was performed using the high-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze-substitution (FS) methods. in EV71-infected cells, large quantities of membranous vesicles accumulated in the perinuclear region of 100\u2013300 nm in diameter. EV71 induces ROs in infected cells and redistributes RTN3 to viral ROs during infection. ER membranes and ER molecules were hijacked by EV71 to form viral ROs. the distribution of reticulon 3 (RTN3) was assessed using immunofluorescence. results showed that RTN3 was redistributed and concentrated in perinuclear foci. this suggests that EV71-induced ROs are closely interrelated with the ER. RD cells stably expressing SHH and NHK were mock infected or infected with EV71. western blotting was used to measure expression of the substrates. levels of both SHH-C and NHK were gradually decreased in EV71-infected cells in a time-dependent manner. core-glycosylated CD147, EV71-2C, and actin. the data are presented as means SD of three independent experiments. to further confirm these inhibitory effects, SHH and NHK stable cell lines were treated with tunicamycin (Tun), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation modification, and the fate of already synthesized glycosylated substrates. NS1 LC is an unassembled immunoglobulin light chain that is degraded through ERAD [50] RD cells stably expressing TTR D18G and NS1 LC were treated with CHX and their degradation was assessed. degradation of both substrates was remarkably inhibited in a time-dependent manner during EV71 infection. apoptosis was 28.6% in cells infected with EV71 for 17 h. combined treatment with CHX for the last 8 h only slightly upregulated the proportion to 32.2%. EV71 infection causes ERAD substrates to be tethered in the ER. RD cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 7 h. Western blotting was then performed with the indicated antibodies. a previously reported dislocation-dependent reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay was used to evaluate different substrates. drGFP assay was used to determine the location of SHH-C in EV71-infected cells. results showed that no GFP signal was observed in either mock-infected or EV71-infected cells. this suggests that EV71 inhibited the retro-translocation activity of SHH-C. EV71 downregulated expression of several molecules in a time-dependent manner. two bands that seemed like cleavage products of Ubc6e could be detected around 25\u201326 kDa in molecular weight. EV71 targets ERAD at multiple targets or at one shared key point. RD cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for the indicated times (hpi: hours post-infection) the cells were harvested and western blotting was performed using the indicated antibodies to detect the indicated ERAD components, EV71 2C, and actin. asterisks indicate the molecules that were obviously downregulated. mutant of 3Cpro (C147S) could cleave Ubc6e in a dose-dependent manner. the cleavage bands were the same molecular weight as in EV71-infected cells. this suggests that EV71 3Cpro cleaves Ubc6e during infection. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Ubc6e/Ubc6e mutants with or without plasmid encoding GFP-3C. at 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with (+) or without () CHX for 4 h. RD cells stably expressing SHH were transfected with increasing doses of plasmids encoding EV71 Flag-tagged 3Cpro. western blotting performed to monitor the degradation of SHH-C under CHX chase. results showed that SHH-C degradation was inhibited gradually with the increasing expression of EV71 3Cpro. however, the inhibitory effects were not as potent as EV71 infection. the molecular weight of the cleavage fragments suggested that the cleavage sites might be located at the region of amino acids 200\u2013300 of Ubc6e. a panel of site-directed mutants with Q mutated to A within the 200\u2013300 amino acid (aa) region was constructed. a new panel of double-site mutants (Q to A) was constructed within the 219\u2013300 aa region based on the Q219A mutant. a third round of screening was conducted using triple-site Q to A mutants. the results showed that triple-site mutant Q219Q260Q273A was totally resistant to 3Cpro cleavage. cleavage at these points will lead to the release of the E2 catalytic domain of Ubc6e into the cytosol and inactive Ubc6e. Mock- and EV71-infected RD cells were treated with ER stress inducers thapsigargin (Tg) and tunicamycin (Tun) to induce Herp expression. the degree of upregulation was compared between mock- and EV71-infected cells. same treatment induced less Herp expression in EV71-infected cells. RD cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 9 h. then treated with Tg (300 nM) or Tun (10 g/ml) for 6 h to induce Herp expression. then, the mRNA expression levels of Herp were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. cDNA3.1-IRES-2A, or pcDNA3.1-IRES-2A(C110A) plasmids (1\u20133 g) at 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and cell lysates were analysed. EV71-induced Herp reduction was caused by blocked protein translation. mRNA expression was assessed using real-time PCR. d mutant 2A(C110A) as the control, Tg and Tun induced Herp expression to a much weaker extent in 2A-transfected cells compared with control cells. d mutant 2A(C110A) as the control, Tg and Tun induced Herp expression to a much weaker extent in 2A-transfected cells. the mechanism of VIMP reduction during EV71 infection was investigated. expression of c-MYC but not p97 was downregulated in 2A- and 2A-transfected cells. RD cells stably expressing SHH were transfected with siRNA to silence Ube6e and Herp. the cells were then chased with CHX under mock- or EV71-infection conditions. RD cells stably expressing SHH-FLAG (A), NHK-FLAG (B), TTR D18G-FLAG (C) and NS1LC-FLAG (D) were transfected with control siRNA and siRNA targeting Ubc6e or Herp. at 36 h post-transfection, cells were mock infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h and then treated with (+) or without knocking down either Ubc6e or Herp attenuated the degradation of CD147 (CG) this suggests that Ubc6e and Herp were also involved in the ERAD of the endogenous ERAD substrate CD147 (CG) this suggests that Ubc6e and Herp were also involved in the ERAD of the endogenous substrate CD147 (CG) p97 and its ATPase activity are essential for EV71 replication. RD cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting Ubc6e or Herp. real-time PCR was used to qualified viral RNA replication. RD cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. western blotting was carried out to detect the knockdown efficiency of different molecules, EV71 2C, and actin. RD cells were pre-treated with increasing doses of DBeQ (0\u201310 M) for 3 h. cell lysates and precipitates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with p97 mouse monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG. at 36 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies. p97 may be hijacked by EV71 from the disabled ERAD pathway to promote its own replication. exogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were further performed in 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged EV71 2C protein and Flag-tagged p97 protein. results suggest that p97 co-exists with EV71 2C and might other viral proteins and is involved in EV71 replication. PI4KB, ARF1 and GBF1 all redistributed to the perinuclear region of infected cells. p97 and 2C co-localized with p97 and 2C on viral replication organelles. p97 and 2C co-localized with PI4KB, ARF1 and GBF1. RD cells stably expressing p97-GFP were infected EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. cells were stained with rabbit anti-PI4KB/ARF1/GBF1 antibodies. EV71 hijacks p97 and uses ER-derived membranes to form viral ROs to support its replication. low-magnification electron micrographs of EV71-infected RD cells (MOI = 10, 12 hpi) Scale bar, 1 m. (D) Magnified view of the boxed region in (A) RD cells stably expressing p97-GFP were mock-infected (upper panel) or infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h (lower panel) p97 and its ATPase activity are essential for EV71 replication, and it co-localizes with EV71 2C protein. p97 and its ATPase activity are essential for EV71 replication, and it co-localizes with EV71 2C. RD cells were transfected with control siRNA and siRNA targeting Ubc6e or Herp. at 36 h post-transfection, cells were mock-infected () or infected (+) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. immunostaining was performed to detect intracellular distribution of p97 and EV71 2C. at 36 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p97 mouse monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG. endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in EV71-infected cells with p97 antibody. results showed 2C immunoprecipitated by p97 antibody but not control IgG. results suggest p97 co-exists with EV71 2C and might other viral proteins. PI4KB, ARF1, and EV71 2C co-localized with p97 and 2C. p97 and 2C co-localized with p97 and 2C on viral replication organelles. p97 and 2C co-localized in perinuclear region. cells were mock-infected (or infected) with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. cells were then fixed and stained with mouse anti-p97 and rabbit anti-PI4KB/ARF1/GBF1 antibodies. RD cells were treated as described in (B) and then stained with rabbit anti-PI4KB/ARF1/GBF1 antibodies. EV71 induces ROs in infected cells and redistributes RTN3 to viral ROs during infection. RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 10) for 12 h. the cells were then fixed and stained with rabbit anti-RTN3 and mouse anti-2C antibodies. EV71 hijacks ER membranes to form single- or double-membrane vesicles. p97 is hijacked from disabled ERAD to form ROs. p97 co-localizes with EV71 2C, RTN3 and other replication-related molecules. EV71 uses a totally different strategy to influence cellular ERAD. it inhibits ERAD via viral proteases, thoroughly suppresses physiological ERAD at multiple points. EV71 hijacks host factor p97 and uses ER-derived membrane components from the disabled ERAD machinery to form its own replication organelles. five principal E3s (Hrd1, gp78, RMA1, TEB4, and TRC8) have been identified in the mammalian ERAD system [29,54\u201356,87]. these two E3-E2 pairs are considered the main executors of substrate ubiquitination in ERAD. current results revealed that EV71 infection caused both Ubc6e cleavage and Hrd1 downregulation. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in EV71-disturbed ERAD inhibited degradation of all ERAD substrates we tested. however, in one recent study, Hagiwara et al. reported accelerated degradation of NHK in Ubc6e/ cells. a previous study demonstrated that UBE2G2-gp78 is responsible for Herp degradation during the recovery from ER stress [63]. however, the mechanism by which Herp is degraded under physiological conditions is unknown. we also tried to identify the E3 partner of Ubc6e that participates in Herp degradation. the current study proposed that p97 hijacks p97 from the disabled ERAD machinery, identified p97 as a host factor for EV71 replication. p97 co-localized with the viral protein 2C on EV71-induced ROs. it remains unclear how p97 functions in ROs. picornavirus formed replication organelles at ER-Golgi interface. EV71 inhibited cellular ERAD, a critical function through which the ER maintains homeostasis. p97 was identified as a new host factor that is essential for EV71 replication.
