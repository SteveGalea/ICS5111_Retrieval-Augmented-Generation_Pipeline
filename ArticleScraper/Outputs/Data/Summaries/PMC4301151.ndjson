{"summary": "the flavivirus genus of family Flaviviridae includes more than 70 viruses. the majority of the flaviviruses are transmitted by an infected mosquito or tick. the majority of the flaviviruses are transmitted by an infected mosquito or tick. flavivirus RdRPs carry out de novo RNA synthesis in viral genome replication (4). the thumb domain contains a priming element that reaches the vicinity of the active site to facilitate initiation (5\u20138) an initiation complex (IC) of de novo RdRPs is unstable and the polymerase needs to make a transition to become a stable and processive elongation complex (EC) MTase-RdRP interface features a six-residue hydrophobic network in the central region and a GTR sequence at the edge. despite the seemingly independent activities of both enzyme modules of NS5 described above, this structure has provided explicit clues in further dissection of the functional regulation between MTase and RdRP. we recently collected evidence that the interface does play essential roles for flavivirus replication (21), thus functionally validating the biological relevance of the intra NS5 mutants with point mutations M_113, M_113/121, M3, R_351/467, R3 and M3-R3 were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. the N-terminal deletion mutants D261, D273, D303 were made by using a site-directed, ligase-independent mutagenesis method (SLIM) librated with a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 9.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 0.02% (wt/vol) NaN3. the final buffer was 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MES, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 0.02% (wt/vol) NaN3. synthetic DNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies) that contained sequences to generate target RNAs were used in PCRs to generate T7-promoter-containing DNA constructs. the target RNAs were purified using 12% polyacrylamide\u20137 M urea gel electrophoresis, excised from the gels, and electro-eluted by using an Elu-Trap device. the assembled RNA constructs were stored at 20\u00b0C. the assembled RNA constructs were stored at 20\u00b0C. unless otherwise indicated a typical 20-l reaction mixture. reaction was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 45, 90, or 120 min. mixture was heated at 100\u00b0C for 45 to 60 s. reactions were first carried out as described for de novo polymerase assay. the EC9 construct was assembled in a 20-l reaction mixture at 30\u00b0C for 60 min prior to supplementation with NaCl and CTP. the reaction proceeded for another 10 or 45 min at 35\u00b0C before being quenched by an equal volume of stop solution. the reaction mixture was otherwise identical to the EC9 final reaction mixture, with the limited consumption of ATP and UTP neglected. kpolapp t represented the fraction of 10-mer contributed by misincorporation prior to the chase reaction. extra data points at 0 min were added to the fitting routine. for all kpolapp values reported, extra data points at 0 min were added to the fitting routine using the 10-mer intensity fraction. values for each data set in panels B and D were taken from three individual experiments. average 10mer_int. fraction and standard deviations are shown. for each data set, the gel of one experiment is shown in panel A. the NS5 protein was purified sequentially using Ni affinity, ion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. the final buffer was 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MES, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 0.02% (wt/vol) NaN3. the yield was in the range of 1 to 15 mg of pure protein per liter of bacterial culture. template strand RNAs were obtained by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription using a parental plasmid pRAV23. synthetic DNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies) that contained sequences to generate the target RNAs were used in PCRs to generate the target RNAs. a 3-min incubation at 45\u00b0C followed by slow cooling to room temperature in RAB to yield the T31/P8 and T33/P10 constructs. the assembled RNA constructs were stored at 20\u00b0C. reaction mixture containing 6 M NS5 or its variant, 4 M RNA construct T32/P2, 300 M UTP, and 300 M ATP in buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM TCEP) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 45, 90, or 120 min. then, the reaction was quenched by an equal volume of stop solution. concentration of NS5 was reduced to 3.2 M (lower than the 4 M concentration of the P32 RNA template) the EC9 construct was assembled in a 20-l reaction mixture at 30\u00b0C for 60 min prior to supplementation with NaCl and CTP. the reaction proceeded for another 10 or 45 min at 35\u00b0C before being quenched by an equal volume of stop solution. kpolapp values were used to obtain the apparent polymerase elongation rate constants (kpolapp) corresponding to the conversion from EC9 to EC10. offset represented the fraction of 10-mer intensity (f) at all five times (t) was fitted to a single exponential rise equation. for all kpolapp values reported, extra data points at 0 min were added to the fitting routine using the 10-mer intensity fraction obtained in the absence of CTP (CTP) both EC9 and IC9 showed resistance to the challenge of a competitor RNA construct. comparison of elongation kinetics on representative full-length NS5 constructs. EC9 and EC10 reactions among five NS5 constructs. the assays we established in this work fall into the third category. they use either genome-derived or artificial heteropolymeric template sequences normally shorter than 100 nt. these assays offer the best power in dissecting the mechanism of RNA synthesis. the removal of the MTase domain drastically improved NS5's solubility under low-ionic-strength and low-glycerol conditions. we carefully examined the solution stability of several of the NS5 variants and found that the removal of the MTase domain drastically improved NS5's solubility under low-ionic-strength and low-glycerol conditions. primer-dependent assay characterizing polymerase initiation activities of JEV NS5. the template strand (cyan) and the primer strand (green) form a 6- or 8-bp duplex in the upstream direction. downstream template folds back to form a stem-loop structure. the polymerase was expected to produce a 9-mer product. the primary misincorporation product was a 10-mer and was likely related to incorporation of a UMP on a templating guanidine. a temperature of 30\u00b0C and a pH of 7.5 were chosen. a de novo polymerase assay for JEV NS5 has the capacity to assess the de novo initiation efficiency. by probing the polymerase\u2013template\u20139-mer EC (EC9), the dissection of the polymerase elongation step becomes possible. the complete NS5 sequence was available in 2012. it turned out that P113, W121, F351, and P585 were invariant. F467 had only one tyrosine (Y) variant, and L115 was also conserved. n-terminal-truncated NS5 constructs were compared with WT NS5 in the two assays described above. first, point mutations in the hydrophobic network were made in the context of full-length NS5. the rationale for the mutations was to modulate the MTase-RdRP interface by replacing one or several hydrophobic residues in the network with aspartic acid. the 12-mer became the dominant product, indicating the completion of primer extension by 4 nt. we chose the percentage of 12-mer intensity at 5 min (designated 12mer_int.%) to obtain semiquantitative information for the overall velocity of the initiation-mode RNA synthesis. the production of the 9-mer was much slower than in the primer-dependent assay. RNA synthesis was monitored at 45, 90, and 120 min in the de novo assay. the total amount of 9-mer product and the 10-mer misincorporation product at the 45-min time point was used to semiquantitatively assess polymerase activity. the production of 9-10-mer was also expected to provide a reasonable measure of polymerase initiation. the de novo assay, the relative intensity of 9-10-mer at the 45-min time point was used to estimate polymerase activities. up or down arrows indicate higher or lower levels of the 9-10-mer compared to the WT. assays were prepared at four different concentrations. each sample was mixed with an equal volume of stop solution. the intensity of 10-mer was moderately higher than that of the 8-mer. we then tested the N-terminal-truncated NS5 variants. a total of six N-terminal-truncated forms of NS5 and the full-length protein (WT) were compared with the WT NS5 in two types of polymerase assays. a total of six N-terminal-truncated NS5 variants were compared with the WT NS5. the relative 9-10-mer_int.% values at the 45-min and 90-min time points were used to estimate polymerase activities. the de novo assay provided the capacity to assess elongation-mode synthesis by using a \u201cchallenge and chase\u201d strategy. EC10 produced in the chase experiment was not derived from dinucleotide-driven synthesis. we first compared 9-10-mer production from EC9 and from an IC9. the synthesis was notably much slower than observed in the parallel EC9 experiment. this competitor can compete with the dissociated T32/P9 for rebinding NS5. the EC9 derived from the P2 primer had gained competency of elongation but was not as stable as was observed in the HCV study. the majority of EC generated by all full-length NS5 constructs was in a precipitated form in the preassembly reaction mixture. the slower initiation variant M_113 mutant showed faster elongation kinetics (kpolapp, 0.20 min1) than the WT enzyme did. the faster initiation variant M3-R3 was slower at elongation (kpolapp, 0.11 min1). nucleotides contain both 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the viral genome to sustain in cis RNA-RNA interactions. these assays provide the best situation mimicking RNA synthesis in vivo. they often cannot provide explicit information for polymerase initiation and/or elongation. the T33/P10 construct was otherwise identical to the T31/P8 construct. when only GTP and ATP were provided, the primer strand was expected to elongate by 4 nucleotides to produce a +4-nt product. the removal of the MTase domain drastically improved NS5's solubility under low-ionic-strength and low-glycerol conditions. a primer-dependent assay characterizes polymerase initiation activities of JEV NS5. the template strand (cyan) and the primer strand (green) form a 6- or 8-bp duplex in the upstream direction. the downstream template folds back to form a stem-loop structure. a NS5/T32/P2 initiation complex (IC2) was assembled using a GG dinucleotide primer. the polymerase was expected to produce a 9-mer product. a temperature of 30\u00b0C and a pH of 7.5 were chosen to achieve a balance of the large amount of the regular 9-mer products. a polymerase complex exhibited fast kinetics with few accumulated intermediates. slow de novo initiation and the subsequent transition to rapid elongation occurred on the way to producing the 9-mer product. this assay has the capacity to assess the de novo initiation efficiency. we carried out a conservation analysis using NS5 sequences from a collection of flaviviruses (41 species and 4 serotypes of DENV) these represented all viral species assigned as flaviviruses by the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2012. it turned out that P113, W121, F351, and P585 were invariant, F467 had only one tyrosine (Y) variant. a collection of NS5 constructs and compared them with WT NS5 in the two assays described above. first, point mutations in the hydrophobic network were made in the context of full-length NS5. the rationale for the mutations was to modulate the MTase-RdRP interface by replacing one or several hydrophobic residues in the network with aspartic acid (D) RNA synthesis was monitored at three incubation time points (5, 15, and 45 min) with ATP and GTP supplied as the only NTP substrates. as the reaction proceeded to 15 and 45 min, the conversion of the primer was nearly finished. the 12-mer became the dominant product, indicating the completion of primer extension by 4 nt. the production of the 9-mer was much slower than the 12-mer production in the primer-dependent assay. only a portion of the short P2 primer was used in the de novo assay. RNA synthesis was monitored at 45, 90, and 120 min in the de novo assay. 12-mer species (12mer_int.%) at the 5-min time point was used to evaluate polymerase activities. up or down arrows indicate higher or lower levels of the 9-10-mer compared to the WT. stars indicate misincorporation products, with lengths of 11 nt or longer. the intensity of 10-mer was moderately higher than that of the 8-mer. n-terminal-truncated NS5 variants showed slower production of 12-mer after 5 and 10 min. polymerase activity was not evident for D303 or D303-R3. the same set of R3 mutations actually led to more profound off-pathway synthesis. the same set of mutations actually led to more profound off-pathway synthesis in D303. a total of six N-terminal-truncated NS5 variants were compared with the WT NS5 in two types of polymerase assays. in the primer-dependent assay, the 12-mer_int.% values at the 5-min and 15-min time points were used to evaluate the polymerase initiation activities. the EC10 produced in the chase experiment was not derived from dinucleotide-driven synthesis. the EC10 produced in the control experiment was not derived from dinucleotide-driven synthesis. we first compared 9-10-mer production from EC9 and an IC9. the EC9 derived from the P2 primer had gained competency of elongation but was not as stable as was observed in the HCV study. the majority of EC generated by all full-length NS5 constructs was in a precipitated form in the preassembly reaction mixture. the majority of EC generated by all full-length NS5 constructs was in a precipitated form in the preassembled. the data were fitted to a single-step irreversible model (EC9 to EC10) to estimate the apparent polymerase elongation rate constant (kpolapp) under the tested condition, the WT NS5 had a kpolapp of 0.14 min1 (Fig. 8A and B) to further confirm our assumption of NTP saturation, we compared the incorporation under CTP concentrations of 100 and 300 M. the flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having an MTase as the only partner of the RdRP immediately fused to its N terminus. in the full-length NS5 structure, the entire fingers domain is well-ordered and adopts canonical folds compared to RdRPs without fusion partners. three primary states of apo NS5 may exist. the dominant state, a1, is an NS5 that maintains the interface interactions with a properly folded RdRP conformation for polymerase initiation. mutations that perturb the interface or affect the proper folding of RdRP would change the equilibrium of the three states, and therefore influence initiation activities. three states of a proposed apo NS5 based on previously reported structural and functional studies. no matter whether the interface interactions were present, states a1 and a2 are initiation competent as the RdRP region adopts a proper fold. two states of an NS5 EC; both are elongation competent. the N-terminal extension of flavivirus NS5 is a quite unique element whose function remains elusive. NS5 retained its polymerase function in both types of initiation assays. the polymerase lost the ability to carry out regular template-directed synthesis in the primer-dependent assay. de novo viral RdRPs share a \u201cpriming element\u201d that projects from the thumb domain to the vicinity of the active site (5\u20137). the priming element facilitates initial steps of de novo synthesis and needs to completely withdraw from the active site when the template-product RNA duplex reaches a length of 7 to 8 h. a de novo viral RdRP EC has been a challenge for about 15 years. the EC structure would reveal the fate of the priming element. if it is dispensable at elongation or it has new missions, a stable EC would likely provide better opportunities toward resolving an EC structure. the complete use of the 8-mer primer provided in 10% excess to the template indicated that the RNA products readily dissociated from the complex. this instability of the complex and the slow kinetics suggested by the accumulation of 9- to 11-mer intermediates together indicated that an EC was not formed in such an assay. n-terminal-truncated NS5 constructs suggest flavivirus/pestivirus-specific extension region is likely indispensable for JEV polymerase function. the work improved our understanding of the regulatory roles of the MTase-RdRP interface in polymerase catalysis. index, ring, and pinky finger subdomains are known to contribute to RdRP catalysis and stability (33, 45, 46) the entire fingers domain is well-ordered and adopts canonical folds compared to RdRPs without fusion partners (5, 47). the index and ring fingers both have direct and conserved interactions with the MTase, strongly indicating that the maintenance of the interface likely plays roles in polymerase function. initiation, the polymerase makes a transition to form a stable EC. the interactions between the polymerase motifs and the RNA scaffold likely take over control of the conformational stability of RdRP. it is conceivable that the equilibrium of the interface formation and unraveling still exist in EC. this would have a lower impact on polymerase catalysis. a significant portion of mutations having a lethal phenotype (21) could be greatly amplified. impairment of either initiation or elongation could be greatly amplified. mutations could potentially disrupt the capping process through regulation of the MTase region of NS5. the sequence of this region is only moderately conserved in flaviviruses. it may be difficult to locate a specific site(s) responsible for the impairment of polymerase initiation. further clarification of its contribution in initiation and similar testing in pestivirus NS5B. de novo viral RdRPs share a \u201cpriming element\u201d that projects from the thumb domain to the vicinity of the active site (5\u20137). the priming element facilitates initial steps of de novo synthesis and needs to completely withdraw from the active site. the EC structure would reveal the fate of the priming element: whether it is dispensable at elongation or it has new missions. the kpolapp values obtained in our study are significantly lower than the typical 10 to 100 s1 reported for picornavirus RdRP ECs (37\u201339, 53), at least to some extent they represent elongation-mode synthesis. the 9-mer to 10-mer conversion is obviously faster than that in the parallel experiment starting with IC9. nese ion often diminishes stringency of RdRP catalysis. the current study provided mechanistic dissections of how the interface-regulated NS5 polymerase activities. the same NS5 variant could bring opposite effects on initiation- and elongation-mode synthesis."}
