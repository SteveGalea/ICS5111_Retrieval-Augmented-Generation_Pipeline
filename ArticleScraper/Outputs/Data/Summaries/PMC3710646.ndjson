{"summary": "traditional vaccine preparations are based on attenuated or inactivated whole viruses or partially purified viral proteins. these strategies present drawbacks due to viral intrinsic characteristics such as poor in vitro replication and antigenic hypervariability. peptides can be easily produced in vitro reducing production costs and simplifying large-scale vaccine production procedures. epitope-based vaccine approach is the identification of epitopes capable of eliciting both humoral and cell-mediated responses. different strategies, spanning from antigen presentation techniques to in silico design of structural motifs to be included in vaccinal preparations, have been developed in order to overcome these issues. mAb-interacting fragments are subsequently identified through MS and mapped in silico on the whole antigen to define epitope sequence and structure. mAb-interacting fragments are subsequently identified through MS and mapped in silico on the whole antigen to define epitope sequence and structure. a library composed by antigen fragments can be created and screened for positive binding to mAbs. peptides are then sequenced, aligned to antigen sequence, and superimposed to its three-dimensional (3D) structure. identification can be done either on a single mimotope sequence or clustering all positive sequences and searching for consensus patch on the structure. five of the most used amino acid scale-based methods are implemented at the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) website. none of the methods implemented previously exceeded the A ROC threshold of 0.6 when benchmarked with three standard datasets. only a small improvement in comparison with a random prediction is in fact demonstrated for single propensity scales. the first generation of these hybrid algorithms comprises, among the others, ABCpred (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/), and BepiPred (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/). the first generation of these hybrid algorithms comprises, among the others, ABCpred (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/), many algorithms capable of predicting conformational epitopes have been developed. they can be divided in structure-based and sequence-based algorithms. they work on three-dimensional (3D) proteins structure obtained either through X-ray crystallography or NMR and exploit different spatial parameters. new algorithms try to improve analysis and broaden targets using linear sequences when structures are not available. the prediction algorithm calculates an immunogenicity score for each residue through a trained nave Bayes classifier. experimentally not all possible epitopes of an antigen might have been identified. a biased training of the machine-learning algorithms has been developed. the first attempt is represented by the CBTOPE algorithm. Zhang et al. determined the PSSM to be the most effective feature. the web server developed by Zhang et al. can provide a satisfactory output that can be used as a good starting point for further experimental evaluation confirming putative epitopes. mimotopes are small peptides able to mimic antigenic conformational structures recognized by an antibody paratope. the most frequently used approach to isolate specific mimotopes recognized by a mAb is based on the screening of a random peptide phage display. if the antigenic protein can be cloned and expressed from recombinant cDNA, a library composed by antigen fragments can be created and screened. canonical 18 mer peptides allow the study of conformational epitopes. it can be efficiently used when antigens 3D structure is not available. many computational methods focus on their mapping. the first generation of these hybrid algorithms comprises, among others, ABCpred (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/), and bepiPred (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/). the first generation of these hybrid algorithms comprises, among the others, ABCpred (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/), a CEP [39] is the first web server developed to predict both linear and conformational epitopes. it relies on residues solvent accessibility and defines a linear epitope when at least three consecutive residues satisfy the solvent exposure parameter. the 2.0 version of DiscoTope recently implemented includes novel strategies to define the spatial neighborhood. PEPITO (http://pepito.proteomics.ics.uci.edu), EPCES (http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/seppa/), and its improved version EPSVR analyze 3D structures. they aim at the division of antigens surface in epitopic and nonepitopic patches on the basis of different propensity scores and solvent accessibility. new algorithms try to improve analysis and broaden targets using linear sequences when structures are not available. protein patches that are physiologically buried in protein-protein complexes can wrongly be considered as possible epitopes. this involves both the proximity threshold of surface residues to be used and the lack of consideration for buried residues below the epitopic patch. a biased training of the machine-learning algorithms has been developed. Zhang et al. determined the PSSM to be the most effective feature in predicting epitopes explaining BEEPro performance. characterization of peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involves different issues related to complexity of their processing and presentation. pathogen-specific T-cell activation involves several steps, including antigen digestion by the proteasome/immunoproteasome, interaction with the transporter associated with antigen processing protein for MHC I binding. effective vaccine peptides have to be recognized by haplotypes widely shared among the population. it provides analysis and prediction tools that require only antigen primary sequence [28]. it also provides analysis and prediction tools that require only antigen primary sequence [28]. using quantitative matrices derived from literature MHC II epitopes predictor NetChop http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop/ Proteasome cleavage sites and proteolytic fragments predictor Part of MAPPP server. other more specific databases are available to date, mostnotably the HIV-dedicated B- and T-cell epitope database. structure-based MHC binding prediction methods can be clustered in three main categories. protein-threading methods use a known peptide/MHC complex structure to predict binding features of others peptides to the same MHC. docking techniques differ from protein threading and homology modeling since they do not rely on a template peptide. new algorithms have moved towards a binding matrix-based strategy. the strategy dismisses the contribute of nonanchor residues, resulting in a prediction lacking specificity and sensitivity. some of them are still used and are part of many prediction servers. ANN algorithms are some of the best predictors for MHC I epitopes. they represent epitopes features as amino acid descriptors and perform complex pattern recognition after being trained with a dataset of epitopic and nonepitopic peptides. main drawback is the capability to predict epitopes only when query peptides and the training dataset are of the same length. many strategies exploiting sequence-based and machine-learning algorithms have been developed to predict antigen cleavage from the proteasome/immunoproteasome and TAP interactions. many of them are embedded in online databases to provide a complete prediction from the whole antigen to single epitopes. the most common approaches used to date are the enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) [83]. it evaluates T-cell cytokines secretion levels (generally IFN-) after antigen recognition. the advantages derived from this technique consist in its high resolution (single-cell) and high throughput results. cell-free methods have been developed to identify a definite antigen region potentially able to stimulate an effective T-cell response. the whole antigen is incubated with adequate soluble MHC molecules and proteases (mainly cathepsins and exopeptidases) the whole antigen is incubated with adequate soluble MHC molecules and proteases. database can be easily accessed through a search engine retrieving information about host specificity, HLA restriction, and binding affinity. it also provides analysis and prediction tools that require only antigen primary sequence [28]. >500 HLA-DR alleles PROPRED http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/propred/ Use of quantitative matrices derived from the literature MHC II epitopes predictor NetChop http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop/. structure-based MHC binding prediction methods can be clustered in three main categories, based on protein threading, homology modeling, or protein-protein docking. protein-threading methods use a known peptide/MHC complex structure to predict binding features of others peptides to the same MHC. in the last decade these methods significantly improved and have moved towards machine-learning methods. first attempts were based on the evidence that MHC binding pocket presents cavities with specific residues that require a certain degree of complementarity with specific epitope residues. this strategy completely dismisses the contribute of nonanchor residues, resulting in a prediction lacking specificity and sensitivity. ANN algorithms are some of the best predictors for MHC I epitopes. they represent epitopes features as amino acid descriptors and perform complex pattern recognition after being trained with a dataset of epitopic and nonepitopic peptides. main drawback is the capability to predict epitopes only when query peptides and the training dataset are of the same length. many strategies exploiting sequence-based and machine-learning algorithms have been developed to predict antigen cleavage from the proteasome/immunoproteasome and TAP interactions. many of them are embedded in online databases to provide a complete prediction from the whole antigen. a broad used cell-based approach is the enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) [83]. it evaluates T-cell cytokines secretion levels (generally IFN-) after antigen recognition. in details, lymphocytes are incubated on plates coated with anticytokines Abs. cell-free methods have been developed to identify a definite antigen region potentially able to stimulate an effective T-cell response. the whole antigen is incubated with adequate soluble MHC molecules and proteases (mainly cathepsins and exopeptidases) the whole antigen is incubated with adequate soluble MHC molecules and proteases. PN-SIA28 has been characterized through different experimental and in silico approaches [94\u201396]. the experimental derived data have been analyzed through freely available bioinformatics tools. the analysis of mimotopes sequences selected through the peptide panning technique has been performed using Pepitope, a freely available online server. es highly conserved among the H5N1 Influenza subtype able to elicit a cellular immune response. the same research group used an almost identical approach to extend their analysis to protein domains less conserved but more protective. the identification of conserved protein domains, shared among the different viruses, opens new perspectives in the development of epitope-based vaccines."}
