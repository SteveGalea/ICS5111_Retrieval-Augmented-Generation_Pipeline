{"summary": "there were 99 sampling occasions (windows) producing a total of 198 May stages for analysis in the size ranges 0.86\u20137.3 m. viral RNA was detected in 14 (14.1%) air samples from 10 (25.6%) patients. in 2003, at least 284 healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected with SARS-Coronavirus during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. nosocomial infection was the primary accelerator of infection accounting for 72% of cases in Toronto and 55% of probable cases in Taiwan [2], [3]. Several medical procedures have been reported to generate aerosols and to increase the risk of pathogen transmission. a surgical mask should be worn by the patient if tolerated and HCWs should wear PPE as recommended for routine care (i.e. a surgical mask) during the procedure. controversy remains about the importance of aerosol transmission in the absence of AGPs. participants air was sampled around hospitalised patients with suspected or proven lower respiratory tract infection located either in pandemic H1N1 (2009) isolation rooms. the sampling team was deployed to units with the highest level of overall activity. baseline samples were those taken during interventions not meeting the WHO definitions of an AGP or taken at least 30 minutes after a WHO defined AGP had been completed. all recruits had at least one baseline sampling event. incidence of WHO defined AGPs was rarer and investigators attempted to capture as many as possible. samples were stored at 20\u00b0C prior to RNA extraction. each sample was concentrated into 500 l using 30 kD macrosep centrifugal devices. samples were frozen at 20\u00b0C and defrosted prior to use in the qRT-PCR assay. the amplicon was purified from a 1% (w/v) agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO vector and heat-shocked into E. Coli TOP10 cells. the influenza A/Cal/04/09 segment 7 insert within pCR 2.1 TOPO-CalM was confirmed by sequencing using M13 forward and reverse priming sites that flanked the insert. each 96-well plate consisted of a standard curve (prepared from a ten-fold dilution series of the nH1N1 A/Cal/04/09 M segment RNA transcript in H2O) each 96-well plate consisted of a standard curve (prepared from a ten-fold dilution series of the nH1N1 A/Cal/04/09 M segment RNA transcript in H2O) which also acted as the assay positive control, only patients confirmed as influenza A H1N1 (2009) RT-PCR positive from respiratory tract samples were considered in the statistical analysis. univariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between propensity to produce a positive H1N1 sample and potential risk factors. participants air was sampled around hospitalised patients with suspected or proven lower respiratory tract infection located either in pandemic H1N1 (2009) isolation rooms or cohort areas. peak sampling times correspond to known periods of heightened H1N1 (2009) activity. blinded to the air sampling data and the H1N1 status of the patients, independently coded interventions as AGPs if they met 2007 and 2009 definitions. all recruits had at least one baseline sampling event. incidence of WHO defined AGPs was rarer and investigators attempted to capture as many as possible. sample processing and analysis methodology On arrival at the laboratory samples were stored at 20\u00b0C prior to RNA extraction. each sample was concentrated into 500 l using 30 kD macrosep centrifugal devices (5000 g for 1.5 hours at 4\u00b0C) any viral RNA present within the resulting concentrate was extracted. the amplicon was purified from a 1% (w/v) agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO vector and heat-shocked into E. Coli TOP10 cells. the influenza A/Cal/04/09 segment 7 insert within pCR 2.1 TOPO-CalM was confirmed by sequencing using M13 forward and reverse priming sites that flanked the insert. qRT-PCR reactions were performed on 96-well plates using the superscript III platinum one-step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) each 96-well plate consisted of a standard curve (prepared from a ten-fold dilution series of the nH1N1 A/Cal/04/09 M segment RNA transcript in H2O) all controls and samples were run in duplicate. the committee felt that the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act did not apply to this study. the committee is constituted in accordance with the Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees (July 2001) only patients confirmed as influenza A H1N1 (2009) RT-PCR positive from respiratory tract samples were considered. table 2 shows the percentage of total RNA found in each stage of the May impinger (Table 2) and the % of RNA collected in each stage during each procedure (Table 3). the situation is similar for respiratory and airway suctioning (3.0% total RNA of which 77.6% was in the 7.3 m size range) procedure Number of sampling occasions (number of patients) % RNA collected >7.3 m % RNA collected 4\u20137.3 m % RNA collected 0.86\u20134 m Median copy no./l (inter-quartile range) for samples with at least one stage with detectable RNA Baseline 76 (39) 78.7 11.1 10.2 7,913 (2,436\u201311,613) Bronchoscopy 3 (3) 24.9 45.2 29.9 148,805 (12 6.21 (2.49\u201315.5) Location 3 6 15 0 0 \u2013 \u2013 Location 4 3 8 2 (2) 14 6,292 (2,838\u20139,745) 3.70 (0.37\u201337.55) 0.38 (0.28\u20130.52) Location Cohort area 24 62 11 (9) 79 7,913 (1,852\u20139,963) referent referent.

produce a positive sample. only 31% of the total variance in the propensity to produce a positive sample is due to differences between individuals, for example in age or hospital location. copy number per litre is significantly positively associated with cases aged 50\u201360 years. analysis of influences on virus quantity in an aerosol is likely to be subject to confounding because of the low number of positive samples. we also included procedures relating to chest physiotherapy in the analysis against AGP (2009) and AGP (2007). results suggest chest physiotherapy is associated with an increased probability of aerosol production if included in the WHO (2009) AGP model. 0.659 9,986 6,579 Respiratory/airway suctioning (2009) 14 3 0.169 800 135 Baseline(2007) 48 4 0.044 3,003 132

81 Chest this study detected influenza virus RNA in 14/99 (14.1%) air-sampling windows in particles 0.86\u20137.3 m. 19.6% of air specimens taken in the presence of a 2009 defined AGP (AGP 2009) revealed virus RNA infractions 0.86\u20137.3 m, compared with only 7.9% in non-AGP (2009) settings. intubation and related procedures (OR = 2.71 (0.15\u201349.1)), respiratory/airway suction (OR = 4.11 (0.50\u201334.0) and chest physiotherapy (OR = 3.06 (0.28\u201333.3) also show increased probability. the quantity of viral RNA is known to vary both between patients and within individual patients during the time-course of their illness. performance of a bronchoscopy increases viral copy number per litre in positive air samples by a factor of 4.37 (CI = 0.60\u201332.0) intubation and related procedures and respiratory/airway suctioning show decreased IRRs (0.12 (0.03\u20130.5) and 0.35 (0.07\u20131.70), respectively. this hospital is a tertiary referral centre for respiratory illnesses. the patient with a higher than average propensity to produce a positive sample was in this group. a negative association between the copy number recovered and the number of days between diagnosis and sampling was found as would be expected. the aerosol infectious dose of influenza A2/Bethesda/10/63 was between 0.6\u20133 TCID50, which equates roughly to 0.6\u20133 virus particles according to Teunis et al., (2010). estimating the aerosol infectious dose from previous studies is difficult due to the lack of studies in this area for health and ethical reasons. the may impinger does not collect particles 0.86 m aerodynamic particle size. it is possible that some of the aerosolized RNA was missed. this was a large and complex study involving collaborations between the laboratory, sampling teams and busy clinicians from five hospitals. the detection of virus RNA in an aerosol within seconds of its generation favours it being derived from viable viruses. inhalation depends on infectious dose, route of inhalation (nose or mouth), tidal volume, breathing rate, timing and underlying susceptibility (immune status) of 15 l/min during an AGP lasting 15 minutes then 225 litres of air will be inhaled during the procedure. the modelled concentration of viral copy numbers found during the bronchoscopy positive air samples was 9,986 copies/litre/minute. this is significantly greater than the 0.6\u20133 TCID50 aerosol infectious dose reported by alford et al. in (1967) the authors are the writing group on behalf of the environmental monitoring of airborne samples (EASE) consortium. the authors would like to thank all members of the EASE consortium."}
