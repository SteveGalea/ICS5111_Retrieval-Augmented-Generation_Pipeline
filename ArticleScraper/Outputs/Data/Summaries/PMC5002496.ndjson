{"summary": "new infectious disease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) has become one of the most egregious public health problems in 21st-century china. the disease is caused by a new pathogen that was finally identified as a coronavirus (SARS-Cov) after infection, patients go through a 2-to-10-day incubation period before typical symptoms (fever, cough, and body aches) appear. complex spatial transmission networks, compound period epidemics, and overwhelming government controls inspired epidemiologists to research this type of person-to-person infectious disease more profoundly with respect to its geographic features. the approach makes it difficult to explain overall spatial transmission without geographic epidemic analysis. the infections were recorded cautiously and totaled 5318 cases. the data were updated and include cases from November 2002 through June 2003. a confirmation system slightly different from that of WHO statistics raised the number to 5327. the registered permanent residence was selected as the first index for the benefit of data integrity and for monitoring the impact of mass population movement. some cases lacked records of both permanent residence and workplace, and the only available addresses for these were syndrome onset locations. BME Model Typical modes of investigation focus on discovering spatial patterns or establishing a time series to study the principles that govern health phenomena. separate the space-time domain into spatial and temporal components permits analysis of those subdomains individually but ignores principles and correlations that may exist because of the composite spatiotemporal structure. x m a p 0 = x 1,..., x m, x k 1,..., x k n represents the estimation points at the same t 0. we computed SARS distribution maps across a time interval of such n instances [t 1,..., t n], and eventually obtained a joint set of maps p map = [x map(1),..., x map(n]]. m sampling points (p 1, p 2,..., p m) comprised the S-KB in this study. the prediction or posterior PDFs provide a statistical description of the health attribute distribution in space-time. spatial distance is typically considered as the sole substantial factor that describes and demonstrates autocorrelation. observation data sample statistics should be the same as the S/TRF. c x is presumed to be a theoretical function that is the same as the traditional covariance models in kriging analysis. a t a X k = A 1 B D d X a = 1 n a g X a X k, (7) where B = e 0 is a constant, g(X a), a = 0,..., n are the so-called Lagrange coefficients that are in spatiotemporal coordinates. a cross-validation procedure is followed to assess BME mapping accuracy. all types of data were input to the SEKS-GUI software. the original observations were sorted in a file, in which each row corresponds to a certain spatial location, date, and outbreak condition. this conversion typically introduces additional uncertainty into the result, because we effectively approximate the spatial reference for each observation. BME provides an effective stochastic method to analyze relationships of SARS outbreaks in the composite space-time domain. it comprises not only epidemiological knowledge bases but also spatiotemporal statistics and dynamic modelling aspects for study. it also offers a software framework for modelling and prediction of epidemic conditions across space-time. points at t 0 and [x k1,..., x kn] represent the estimation points at the same t 0. The BME method operates in three successive stages to analyze the stochastic epidemic process. in the first stage, structural characteristics of a space-time random field are incorporated in the analysis by means of all available epistemic information. spatial distance is typically considered as the sole substantial factor that describes and demonstrates autocorrelation and the underlying disease field structure. however, the epidemic time is also important in the study of disease spread. the posterior PDF on the left side is conditioned upon the BME prior PDF, which is given in more detail by f G X m a p = e 0 + T g X m a p = e 0 + a = 1 N a g X a. we can compute various statistical quantities, such as the mean, covariance, semivariogram, and higher-order statistics. BME theory develops a system of equations for each value of g(X a) from which the a coefficients are calculated. a cross-validation procedure is followed to assess BME mapping accuracy. n ref validation data were randomly selected as references for accurate estimation. all counties with SARS outbreaks were in the south and east of mainland china. 950 outbreak cases were observed in 194 locations. west china has only 1% of the national population but covers half the country's area. the empirical and fitted theoretical spatiotemporal covariances characterize the SARS S/TRF. the covariance was estimated at the nodes shown with small red circles connected with coarse surface plates. spatial correlation has some fluctuation close to zero distance. a spatial lag coefficient a = 0.45 is in good agreement with the first geographical law. the numbers of outbreak events that were 0.45 degrees in longitude (50 km) apart had greater similarity to corresponding numbers of closer events. inversely, there was little to no spread relationship between numbers of outbreak events >2 degrees (220 km) apart. the 50 pieces of data nearest an estimation point essentially considers average temporal ranges of 5 days and distances 10 degrees. this parameter was used to convert the space-time coordinates of any location into a common spatiotemporal distance in the continuum of SARS outbreak S/TRFs. this parameter was used to convert the space-time coordinates of any location into a common spatiotemporal distance in the continuum. control measures limit population transport, so the disease is likelier to have greater spread over nearby areas. if this was above 37.5\u00b0C, the individual would be forced into a state of quarantine in isolation wards until the temperature recovered to normal levels. population density is an explanatory factor for the fact that SARS spread is mostly in urban areas. Approximately 19% of people working in health services were infected by their patients. most probable suspects for disease spread were labourers and businessmen. based on these analyses, it is concluded that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics. there was a high temporal correlation and relatively low spatial correlation of SARS outbreaks."}
