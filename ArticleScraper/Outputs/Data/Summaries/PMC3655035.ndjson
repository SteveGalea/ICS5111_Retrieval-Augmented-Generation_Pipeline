{"summary": "ILI can be caused by numerous pathogens, but there is limited information on the etiology and epidemiology of ILI in china. at least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. influenza-like illnesses (ILI), a subset of acute respiratory infections, are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. of the 10 million deaths of children less than five years of age, 1.9 million children died from ILI in the year 2000 [3] the elderly and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems have the greatest risk of serious complications from ILI. in 2005, at least 3.4 million cases of severe RSV-associated ARI requiring hospital admission occurred worldwide. between 66,000\u2013199,000 children younger than five years of age died from RSV-associated ARI. in temperate regions such as the united states and Europe, the etiologic agents associated with ILI have been well characterized. sFluB, sFluB, and H1N1pdm09 were detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) of 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People\u2019s Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. in the 42 specimens with co-infections, the most frequent combinations were sFluA (H3N2) plus RSV, followed by sFluA (H3N2) + PIV, sFluA (H3N2) + ADV, sFluB + RSV, PIV + RSV, PIV + ADV, RSV + HMPV, and RSV + ADV. of 924 patients with ILI, 540 (58.44%) were male and 384 (41.56%) female. Respiratory tract viruses were detected in 231 (46.80%) of the male patients and 181 (47.14%) of the female, an insignificant difference. the distribution of viruses according to age group in 924 patients with ILI 5 yr; n =536 5 yr-14 yr; n =23 25 yr-59 yr; n = 55 60yr; n = 2 Total; n = 924 Total no.
