{"summary": "both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL vectors expressed HA proteins in insect and mammalian cells. both vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL exhibited higher transduction efficiencies than vAc-EGFP in mammalian cells. the vector displaying the HA antigen on the virion surface elicited a Th2-biased immune response. the vector displaying HA and mediating HA expression in the cell (vAc-HA-DUAL) elicited a Th1-biased immune response. both viruses elicited efficient responses in immunized mice. but they showed different biases with regard to Th1 and Th2 balance. results provide new insight into the immune responses elicited by baculovirus vectors. recombinant baculoviruses, vAc-EGFP, vAc-HA, and pFB-HA-DUAL, were generated from the plasmids, pFB-EGFP, pFB-HA, and pFB-HA-DUAL. virions in the supernatant were concentrated by centrifugation at 40 000g for 1 h; pellets were suspended in PBS and further purified by 25%\u201360% human lung (A549) cell lines were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. baculovirus transduction of mammalian cells BHK or A549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured until the cells reached approximately 70%\u201380% confluence. then, the culture a minimum of 10 000 events were collected and analyzed for each sample. data were analyzed using the CELLQUEST software. representative results from at least three independent experiments are shown. splenocytes were harvested from the mice one week after the second immunization and cultured in 24-well plates (1106/well) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in the presence of one of the following: an HA-specific peptide (a 14-mer peptide from the middle region of HA, 5 g/mL, Biodesign, catalog number R88640) a control of untreated splenocytes was also included. cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. cells were washed twice with PBS and 5 times with wash buffer. 100 L of properly diluted (1:10) streptavidin-HRP solution was added to each well. the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. pFB-HA-DUAL plasmid was digested from pFB-GR using XbaI. the full-length gene from the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was constructed from the HA gene sequence of A/Vietnam/1203/2004. it was then inserted into pFB-EGFP between the BamH I and SalI sites downstream of the baculovirus promoter. titers were determined by end-point dilution assay in Sf9 cells11. virions were treated with an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. the viral nucleocapsids were collected by centrifugation at 50 000g for 1 h. Western blot analysis Total protein from cell or virus samples was separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Flow cytometry BHK or A549 cells were transduced with baculovirus at an MOI of 10 for BHK cells and an MOI of 100 for A549 cells. experiments were performed under constant conditions of 231 \u00b0C, 40%5% humidity and a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle. serum samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus for serological testing and antibody assay. splenocytes were harvested for ELISPOT assay. ELISPOT assay The number of splenocytes producing cytokines upon antigen stimulation was determined using the ELISPOT assay. 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 100 L per well of specific antibody against the cytokines of interest. the plates were washed three times with sterile and pyrogen-free PBS and blocked with blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the plate was washed as described above and developed for 25 min. the reaction was stopped by thoroughly rinsing both sides of the PVDF membrane with deionized water. the blank control consistently demonstrated fewer than 10 SFC (spot forming cells) per 106 splenocytes. vAc-HA-DUAL, vAc-HA, and vAc-EGFP cells were uninfected. total cellular extracts from Sf9 cells were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot. c-EGFP, vAc-HA, and vAc-HA-DUAL were used to transduce BHK cells at an MOI of 100. green fluorescence was observed in cells transduced by all three viruses 24 h post-transduction (pt) as expected, Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies demonstrated HA expression only in BHK cells transduced with vAc-HA-DUAL. the percentages of EGFP-positive cells in BHK cells transduced by vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL were twice as high as in cells transduced by vAc-EGFP. similar differences were observed between HA-displaying recombinant viruses and control virus in A549 cells. vAc-HA and vAc-HA induced 3\u20134 times more IgA and IgG than vAc-EGFP. vAc-HA elicited 20% more IgA and IgG than vAc-HA-DUAL. the reason for these differences remains to be elucidated. splenocytes were immunized with vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL mice. the number of IL-4-secreting splenocytes was approximately 40- and 20-fold higher in vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL mice than in vAc-EGFP mice. similar results were observed in separate experiments measuring the number of splenocytes producing IL-2 and IL-6 after antigen stimulation. vAc-HA-DUAL elicited a Th1-biased response whereas vAc-HA elicited a Th2-biased response. the control virus, vAc-EGFP, contained the egfp gene but not the HA gene. the EGFP and HA expression cassettes were inserted in the polyhedrin locus. no HA protein was observed in cells infected by vAc-HA. 9 cells infected with vAc-HA-DUAL and untransduced BHK cells were used as positive or negative controls. virions produced by the recombinant baculoviruses were purified from the medium of infected Sf9 cells. the HA protein was partially cleaved to HA1 and HA2 in BHK cells. recombinants reached similar titers as vAc-EGFP late in the infection. syncytium formation was also observed in Sf9 cells infected with vAc-EGFP, vAc-HA, and vAc-HA-DUAL. each data point represents the mean value of 3 replicates. antibody responses in mice immunized with recombinant baculoviruses Mice were vaccinated twice (d 1 and d 15) with recombinant baculoviruses. specific serum antibodies against HA were measured on d 21 using a competitive ELISA; higher ELISA readings indicate lower levels of anti-HA antibodies. splenocytes from immunized mice were immunized with vAc-HA-DUAL, vAc-HA, vAc-EGFP, or PBS. titers of total IgG and IgA antibodies were determined by ELISA. production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines by splenocytes from immunized mice. nocytes were obtained after two immunizations and stimulated with antigen-specific peptide (HA, 14 mer), an unrelated peptide (NA, 16 mer) or plant hemaglutinin (PHA, positive control) Cytokine-producing cells were assayed with ELISPOT. un-stimulated control (Blank) and no-cell control were included. vAc-HA-DUAL elicited a Th1-biased response whereas vAc-HA-DUAL elicited a Th2-biased response. splenocytes from mice immunized with vAc-EGFP, vAc-HA, or Ac-HA-DUAL were isolated one week after second immunization and stimulated in vitro with peptides of HA or NA, or PHA for vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL showed HA proteins on the virion surface. the baculovirus major envelope protein affected viral entry and/or assembly and budding17, 18. however, the effect seems to be limited, as the virus titer caught up. in mice injected with vAc-HA and vAc-HA-DUAL, significant levels of HA-specific antibodies were produced. splenocytes from the immunized mice were cultured in vitro to test their ability to produce IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6. more splenocytes from immunized mice produced IFN- and IL-2 than the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. level of IFN- was higher than that of IL-4 in the culture medium. vAc-HA-DUAL also found to be more effective in inducing HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro. a baculovirus vector with a mammalian expression cassette producing proteins from a SARS-like coronavirus could elicit a Th1-dominant immune response in mice6, 13, 14, 15, 16. a similar approach has been used to develop vaccines against pseudorabies virus."}
