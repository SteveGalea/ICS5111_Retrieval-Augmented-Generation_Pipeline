{"summary": "inhibition receptor PD-1 plays a dominant role in T cell exhaustion, a state of progressive loss of T cell function resulting from repetitive antigen stimulation. PD-1 mediated T cell exhaustion is characterized by increased expression of the transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), co-expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, Tim3, and 2B4. PD-1 regulates T cell mobility in tissues (14) and T cell survival (10, 15) in chronic high-viremic infections, T cell dysfunction is not absolute as shown by the emergence of CD8 T cell epitope-escape HIV late in infection (16), and increased viral titers after depletion of CD8 T cells in chronic SIV infection (17, 18). expression of PD-1 has recently been reported in human lung- and brain-resident CD8 T cells, with PD-1 signaling proposed to muPyV establishes a systemic low-level persistent infection in mice. whether the virus persists as a smoldering infection or cycles between latency and reactivation has yet to be experimentally ascertained. only a few studies have examined PD-1's impact on TRM responding to a persistent viral CNS infection (8, 9, 30). PD-1 signaling controls the inflammatory response during acute infection. the absence of PD-1 signaling during persistent infection resulted in lower neuroinflammation than in WT mice. PD-1 was further found to affect the differentiation of virus-specific CD8 bTRM. quantification of muPyV Genomes and LT-Ag mRNA TaqMan real-time PCR was performed in an ABI StepOnePlus thermocycler. total RNA from FACS-purified cells was insolated using TRIzol. cDNA was prepared using RevertAid H minus reverse transcriptase. BMDCs were re-plated with 100 U/ml IFN- (PeproTech US, Rocky Hill, NJ) to induce antigen presentation and PD-L1 expression. BMDCs were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated with 10 M LT359 peptide at 37\u00b0C for 6 h prior to co-culture with T cells isolated from brain or spleen. Spleen and brain cells were exposed to Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and Fc Block (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) prior to staining with DbLT359 tetramers (NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA) antibodies to the following molecules were stained for viability and surface markers. anti-IFN- staining in the absence of peptide was 1% of CD8+ CD44hi gated cells. samples were acquired on an LSR II or LSRFortessa. data analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) mice were perfused transcardially with heparinized PBS followed by 10% NBF. an adhesion frequency 0.1 between a T cell and a DbLT359\u2013coated RBC is scored as Ag-reactive. 10 m FFPE brain sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. antigen retrieval was then performed using 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) brain sections were stained with anti-NeuN or anti-APC for 30 min at room temperature. the gene list was imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) for enrichment analysis of the pathways and upstream regulators. the enrichment data and the p-values were calculated by Fisher's exact test. e specific for the large T Ag (LT-Ag) 206\u2013215 amino acids from the SV40 virus and the MuPyV mutant encoding this epitope have been previously described. at 7-12 weeks of age, anesthetized mice were i.c. inoculated by injecting the right frontal lobe with 30 l of 2 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MuPyV strain A2 in DMEM 5% FBS marrow-derived cells were plated (5 106 cells/100 mm diameter Petri dish) and cultured in DMEM 10% FBS with GM-CSF (20 ng/ml) after 10 days, differentiated bone marrow dendritic cells were harvested by gentle trypsinization. isch Gladbach, Germany, 1:200, ACSA-1), and O4 (product code 130-095-891, Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; 1:20 dilution) brains digested with collagenase I (40 mg/100 ml) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by two-step 44%/66% Percoll gradient to remove myelin and cell debris. anti-IFN- staining in the absence of peptide was 1% of CD8+ CD44hi gated cells. samples were acquired on an LSR II or LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) i.c.v. antibody administration lasted 14 days at a flow rate of 12 l/day. delivery of antibody to the lateral ventricle was confirmed by cutting the brain at the site of cannulation. anesthetized mice were perfused transcardially with heparinized PBS followed by 10% NBF. three-mm pieces were coronally using a cutting matrix and immersed overnight in 10% NBF. antigen retrieval was then performed using 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) RNA from uninfected control groups (2 mice/pool) and infected groups (3 mice/pool) were subjected to nanoString gene expression analysis. fold changes and p-value for the genes were calculated using nSolver software. microglia and infiltrating monocytes expressed at least a log higher LT-Ag transcripts than oligodendrocytes. astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes, express the viral capsid protein, VP1. astrocytes and microglia harbored a higher viral LT-Ag mRNA load. contour plots with frequency of PD-L1+ oligodendrocytes (CD11bneg/CD45neg/O4+), astrocytes (CD11bneg/CD45neg/GLAST+), microglia (CD11bhi/CD45int) and infiltrating monocytes (CD45hi) from mock inoculated controls and MuPyV-infected mice at 8 dpi bTRM express PD-1 during muPyV infection. expression of the transcription factor IRF4 is reflective of TCR affinity. expression of the transcription factor IRF4 correlates with TCR signaling strength. 4-5 mice per group were isolated from the brains and spleens of mice 30 dpi. a subset of virus-specific peripheral CD8 T cells infiltrate or survive during bTRM development. DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen expressed a low level of PD-1 during acute infection. a sizable fraction of PD-1hi muPyV-specific CD8 T cells also expressed the inhibitory receptors Tim3 and 2B4. PD-1 signaling augmented IFN- production by anti-viral CD8 T cells in vivo. lack of PD-1 signaling augments CD8 T cell IFN- production in vivo. nanoString gene expression analysis using a 254 gene mouse inflammation panel was performed on brains from acutely (8 dpi) and persistently (35 dpi) infected mice. at 8 dpi, a higher number of genes were upregulated in PD-L1/ (50 genes) vs. WT mice. PD-L1/ mice undergo dynamic and disparate changes in inflammatory transcriptomes from acute to persistent phases of infection. a heightened inflammatory state is indicated in PD-L1/ mice. dpi the neuroinflammation signaling pathway, interferon signaling, role of PRRs in virus recognition and iNOS signaling exhibited higher enrichment scores and \u2013log(p-value) in PD-L1/ mice. these data provide further evidence for a sustained inflammatory response in WT mice but not in PD-L1/ mice. type PD-1 signaling has been postulated to regulate CD8 T cell memory formation. in MCMV infection, PD-1 signaling promoted bTRM formation. however, unlike in MCMV acute infection, PD-L1/ mice showed only a modest, albeit significant, increase in the number of the DbLT359-tetramer+ CD8 T cells expressing CD103. lack of PD-1 signaling is associated with increased frequency of CD103+ bTRM (A) number of DbLT359 specific CD8 T cells in WT and PD-L1/ mice. gMFI of IRF4 expression by DbLT359+ CD8 T cells at 9 and 45 dpi. small foci of demyelination and vacuolation were present in the cingulum bundle and the external capsule at 9 dpi. small foci of demyelination and vacuolation were present in the cingulum bundle and the external capsule at 9 dpi. enlarged ventricles and edema in the white matter tracts became progressively worse by 30 dpi. no difference in IRF4 expression stemmed from differences in TCR affinity. expression of LT-Ag transcript in the brain was also found to be similar between WT and PD-L1/ mice. a mechanism other than modulation of TCR affinity comes into play to dampen TCR signaling strength by virus-specific CD8 T cells in the absence of PD-1 signaling. PD-L1 Deficiency results in Impaired Virus Control Upon Re-infection Lack of PD-1 signaling due to genetic ablation of PD-L1 resulted in an increased fraction of CD103+ MuPyV-specific CD8 bTRM but did not affect virus levels. to test bTRM recall responsiveness, we re-inoculated >45 dpi WT and PD-L1/ mice i.c. mice at day 5 post-challenge also showed similar abilities to produce IFN- and degranulate (e.g., CD107a/b+) upon in vitro stimulation with LT359 peptide. the recall response was mainly due to the activation of CD103+ cells, as only CD103+ cells showed high proliferative potential. muPyV-infected Glial Cells and Infiltrating Monocytes Express high levels of PD-L1. oligodendrocytes expressed at least a log higher LT-Ag transcripts than oligodendrocytes. oligodendrocytes expressed at least a log higher expression of VP1 transcripts. astrocytes and not oligodendrocytes express the viral capsid protein, VP1 (Figure 1C), a result in line with the human chimeric glial mouse-JCPyV infection model. PD-L1+ astrocytes and microglia harbored a higher viral LT-Ag mRNA load as well. pi stained with antibodies specific for the indicated CNS cell markers (green) and for muPyV capsid protein VP1 (red) arrows in merged images indicate VP1+ cells (magnification 400X) LT-Ag mRNA copy numbers from PD-L1+ and PD-L1 microglia and astrocytes. each point connected by a line indicates cells from a pool of 3 mice per group. gMFI of IFN-+ CD44+ CD8 T cells from the brain and spleen. each point connected by a line indicates cells from one mouse. data are from two independent experiments with 4-5 mice per group. dichotomy in PD-1 expression was recapitulated by endogenous DbLT359-specific CD8 T cell response. a sizable fraction of PD-1hi muPyV-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen only transiently expressed a low level of PD-1 during acute infection. dbLT359-specific CD8 T cells from the spleen showed only a modest increase in IFN- production at 8 dpi when stimulated by PD-L1/ BMDCs. this time point coincident with PD-1-mediated inhibition of virus-specific CD8 T cell effector activity during MuPyV encephalitis. regulated I-Ab expression was seen in mice that received IFN- deficient-transgenic TCR CD8 T cells. lack of PD-1 signaling augments CD8 T cell IFN- production in vivo. gene set upregulated in PD-L1/ mice at 35 dpi represented a subset of those same genes that were upregulated at 8 dpi. differences were reinforced by principal component analysis (PCA) which showed that the inflammatory gene expression profile in the brains of WT mice at 35 dpi were significantly different from both uninfected as well as 8 dpi WT mice. PCA of each pooled sample was performed using normalized counts of all genes in the array. uninf1 and uninf2 are two independent sets of mock infected controls samples run along with the 8 dpi and 35 dpi MuPyV-infected samples. heightened inflammatory state is indicated in PD-L1/ mice by engagement of pathways involved in interferon signaling, dendritic cell maturation and recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PR pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between muPyV-infected PD-L1/ and mock-inoculated PD-L1/ control brain at 8 dpi (A) and 35 dpi (B) using IPA software. bubble size represents the z-score and color represents the -log(p-value) calculated by Fisher's exact test. PD-L1/ mice had moderately higher numbers of CD25+ FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells. this increase coincides with higher TGF- transcripts in PD-L1/ mice. lack of PD-1 signaling is associated with increased frequency of CD103+ bTRM. gMFI of PD-1, Tim3, and 2B4 and Blimp-1, EOMES, and TCF-1. data from two to three independent experiments with 3\u20138 mice per group. at 8 dpi, there was no difference in expression of IRF4 by DbLT359-tetramer+ CD8 T cells between WT and PD-L1/ mice. at 45 dpi the bTRM from PD-L1/ mice showed lower IRF4 expression. expression of LT-Ag transcript in the brain was also found to be similar between WT and PD-L1/ mice. genetic deficiency of PD-L1 did not change expression of PD-1, 2B4, or Tim3 by MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells. lack of PD-1 signaling also did not affect expression of the transcription factors Eomes, Blimp-1 and TCF-1 (all known to be associated with exhaustion) DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells were seen only in the brains of the re-infected mice. difference between total and virus-specific CD8 T cells in the re-infected mice suggested this increase was predominantly due to recall expansion of anti-MuPyV bTRM rather than recruitment. total CD8 and DbLT359+ CD8 T cells from brains were analyzed by flow cytometry. number of total CD8 and DbLT359+ CD8 T cells per brain was euthanized. PD-L1/ mice have diminished ability to control virus levels upon homologous virus re-infection. CD103 expression has been linked to CD8 bTRM formation in response to VSV CNS infection. other studies show that CD8 T cell motility in the small intestine mucosa and brain are not dependent on CD103 (58, 62) PD-1 expression by CD8 T cells may not inevitably result in T cell exhaustion. PD-1 is dispensable for CD8 T cell exhaustion in chronic LCMV infection. expression of multiple inhibitory receptors by CD8 T cells in addition to PD-1 (67) microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes express PD-L1 under various inflammatory conditions, such as those induced by MCMV and TMEV CNS infections. PD-L1 in mouse coronavirus encephalomyelitis is only transiently and poorly expressed on microglia, although oligodendrocytes exhibit high and sustained expression. PD-L1/ mice showed exclusive enrichment of NF-B and apoptotic pathways, as well as IL-9, IL-12, and IL-3 signaling pathways. IL-15 is of particular interest because it is expressed by CNS parenchymal cells as well as by infiltrating immune cells. IL-15 limits apoptosis in neuronal cells and suppresses nitric oxide production in neurons (72) cytolytic activity of airway-resident memory CD8 T cells a secondary respiratory virus challenge (80). we reported that Type I and Type II IFNs inhibit muPyV replication in vitro and in peripherally inoculated mice. that type I IFN regulates muPyV-specific CD8 T cell memory differentiation and function. the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine has an Animal Welfare Assurance on file with the National Institutes of Health's Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.
