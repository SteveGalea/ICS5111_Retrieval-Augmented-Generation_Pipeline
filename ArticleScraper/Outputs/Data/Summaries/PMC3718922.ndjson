{"summary": "ideal vaccine against an infectious pathogen should prime the host for induction of pathogen-specific memory immune responses at the appropriate mucosal compartments. previous studies have established that mucosal vaccination can efficiently stimulate the local mucosal immunity and the broadly functional systemic immunity. sublingual immunization is widely being used to deliver sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for treatment of type 1 (allergic) hypersensitivity. repeated sublingual administration of an allergen has shown to induce allergen-specific immune responses that mediate skewing of allergic Th2 responses to Treg induction and/or Th1 activation. a group of mice received different concentrations (10, 50, 200g) of OVA (used as a model soluble protein antigen) together with cholera toxin (CT) as mucosal adjuvant (2). sublingual delivery of OVA promoted proliferation of OVA-specific nave CD4+ T cells with mixed Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles. sublingual immunization with OVA induced gp41-specific CTLs in the genital mucosa. however, the induction of CTL response required the presence of CT adjuvant. a similar study showed that sublingual immunization of mice with HIV-1 gp41 and a reverse transcriptase polypeptide as an adjuvant conferred protection against genital challenge. intramuscular delivery elicited HPV-specific, pseudovirus-neutralizing serum and cervicovaginal IgGs levels. sublingual delivery generated 38-fold lower serum and 2-fold lower cervicovaginal IgGs levels than intramuscular delivery. neither route substantially increased HPV-specific mucosal IgAs. cosa and cross-presentation of vaccine antigens within the antigen presenting cells (APCs) may have promoted the induction of influenza virus-specific CTLs response observed in this study (10,12) a single sublingual administration of live-attenuated influenza virus did not cause pathology and established broad-range protection against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus subtypes. parental immunization induced robust M2e-specific antibody responses in the serum but failed to provide complete protection against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. sublingual immunization with 3M2eC resulted in significant decrease in M2e-specific serum antibody levels compared to parental vaccination. sublingual immunization of mice with Gcf elicited strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses and effectively reduced the lung virus titer following RSV challenge in the absence of Th2-biased cytokine responses. sublingual immunization of rADV-S in mice induced SARS virus-specific immune responses. sublingual immunization has been shown to be safe and highly effective in generating robust immune responses against the administered antigen. studies also suggest that sublingual immunization could be a better alternative to the traditional parental route of vaccine delivery against both genital and respiratory pathogens (3,4,6-8,11)."}
