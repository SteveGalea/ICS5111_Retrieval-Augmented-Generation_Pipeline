{"summary": "existing data on the characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) gathered throughout Indonesia have been recognized to indicate variants similar to globally distributed vaccine strains. despite past and current intensive vaccination programs, IBV infections in the country\u2019s poultry industry have not been effectively controlled. IBV is an avian pathogen from the family Coronaviridae. it is highly potential to spread rapidly among non-protected poultries. infected chickens, IBV affects the upper respiratory tract. the S glycoprotein of any Coronavirus, including IBV, is recognized as having a virion surface, a rod-shaped protein that is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [7]. Besides, it contains four domains that are involved in anchoring the protein into the lipid bilayer of a host cell. the S glycoprotein has the most varied structure among other proteins in IBV gene. most classic IBV cases, including the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, infects respiratory tract. nephropathogenic strains, which occur mostly in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, infect and damage kidneys that may later result in a significant mortality rate. isolate I-37 was classified into Connecticut (Conn) serotype. in general, IBV isolates from Indonesia are characterized as variants similar to globally distributed vaccine strains. vaccination is the most common method to prevent IBV infections. study attempts to focus on pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like IBV infections. the current study may reveal clear molecular characteristics of these two strains as a means to support the implementation of various control strategies, particularly vaccination-related actions. samples in form of cecal tonsil and trachea from selected chickens were collected in the laboratory. 0.2 mL supernatant from sample suspensions was inoculated in allantoic cavity of specific pathogen free (SPF) or IBV antibody neutral 10-day-old embryonated eggs. after 48 h, allantoic fluids were harvested from these incubated eggs. a total of 25 L mixture consisting of 2.5 L RNA (20-50 ng), 0.25 L RT, 12.5 L 2x MyTaq One-Step Mix, and 1 L (200 nm) each of specific forward and reverse primers targeting S1 gene of IBV [32] was prepared. PCR was conducted for 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and an extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. samples were obtained from commercial poultry farms suspected to IBV infection(s) no experimentation on live animals or infection study was undertaken. samples were mixed from different flocks in different commercial poultry farms. RNA extraction and sequencing Viral RNA was extracted from stored tissue supernatant or allantoic fluids using Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit II. RT-PCR was conducted using myTaqTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit. PCR was conducted for 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s. followed by an annealing at 49\u00b0C for 10 s and an extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. a final extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. a total of 47 IBV reference sequences including Mass, Conn, 4/91, and QX-type vaccine strains were taken from GenBank [34] samples were taken from one commercial poultry farm. they were sourced from different flocks on the farm. a physical characteristic of \"penguin-like\" stance or standing with lower abdomen was also reported. field isolates and 47 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. they include vaccine strains such as 4/91, Mass (H52, H120, and Mass 41), Conn, and QX (QXIBV and D388) sequence alignment of 318 bp long S1 gene is constructed from 10 field isolates from central Java and Yogyakarta. phylogenetic analysis is constructed using neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. isolation vary following the emergence of suspected IB infection(s) in commercial poultry farms. the periods include 2012 (two samples), 2017 (five samples), and 2018 (three samples). samples gathered in 2018 (MHW-O-NSTR-2018, MHW-O-NSTR-2-2018, and MHW-O-NSTR-1-2018) phylogenetic tree was constructed based on S1 sequences that contain 10 field isolates and 47 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) the genetic relationship from 318 bp S1 gene showed that 7 of 10 isolates were grouped in 4/91-like cluster. sequence alignment of 318 bp long S1 gene is constructed from 10 field isolates from central Java and Yogyakarta in conjunction with 47 reference strains. phylogenetic analysis is constructed using neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. cases of IB disease in the country are continuously occurring even within actively IB-vaccinated chicken flocks. a continuous characterization of virus isolates on the fields is critical to design a properly measured strategy to prevent IB disease. a phylogenetic analysis of their S1 gene fragment reveals two distinct IBV genotype clusters, which are stated as 4/91-like and QX-like. the current study reveals 4/91-like cluster to account for 7 of 10 isolates under investigation. the current study reveals 4/91-like cluster to account for 7 of 10 isolates. 4/91-type IBV strain is a nephropathogenic IB virus that has higher pathogenicity on the kidney compared to other organs. circulating 4/91-like isolates are not originated from vaccine strains but from pathogenic strains on the fields. a prior study in Hungary has reported the detection of QX and 4/91 strains in poultry farms without noticeable clinical signs and drops in egg production. a cocirculation of 4/91, QX, and Mass strains in Belgium has been reported to occur in poultry farms experiencing similar respiratory signs and egg deformity without any reported nephritis and cystic oviduct. strains classified into cluster QX-like are recognized as causing chickens to show physical and statistical signs such as drops in egg production, penguin-like stance, and rough eggshell. strains classified into cluster QX-like are recognized as causing chickens to show physical and statistical signs such as drops in egg production. IBV infections in chickens have been causing various indications, including pigmented eggshell and drops in egg production. the syndrome is induced through infections in young chickens by various strains of IB virus, including Mass, Australian T, and several QX strains [24,54] IBV vaccines based on Mass strain have also been proven as inefficient in delivering protections against 4/91 IBV strain. a minor change in S1 sequence would swiftly cause poor cross-protection and vaccine failure. a new vaccination program that delivers cross-protection against multiple IBV strains is clinically required. new pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like IBV strains circulating in the country. this is the first molecularly proof report on these two strains in Indonesia. this is the first molecularly proof report on these two strains in the country. the current study is intended to focus on molecular analysis of IBV strains that manifest certain clinical signs in infected chickens. a challenge experiment on SPF chickens is therefore required to prove the pathogenicity of the discovered IBV strain cluster clusters."}
