{"summary": "the filoviruses are relatively simple viruses of 19-Kb genomes. they consist of seven genes which encode nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein, four smaller viral proteins (VPs) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), all in a single strand of negative-sensed RNA. the development of an effective treatment for EBOV is hindered by lack of a clear understanding of filovirus pathogenesis. clotting inhibitor was recently shown to protect 33% of rhesus monkeys. the ability of virus-specific antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit viral growth by interfering with translation of viral RNAs was first demonstrated in 1978. the successful inhibition of viral replication by PMOs in these reports was demonstrated in vitro. molecule with MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences in a reporter-based in vitro translation assay. no inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 M concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets. e6 cells were pretreated for 24 h with 20 M of EBOV VP24-specific PMO (blue), EBOV VP35-specific PMO (yellow), EBOV L-specific PMO (yellow), combination of the three EBOV-specific PMOs (gray), or a scrambled PMO (black) the cells were infected with EBOV-Zaire (multiplicity of infection = 1). the three PMOs exhibited a wide range of efficacy against lethal EBOV infection. both the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection when the mice were pretreated twice with 500 g doses. the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs conferred survival to 30% of treated mice at the 500-g dose. a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and at the highest concentration, the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. multiple injections of nonspecific PMOs did not enhance survival of EBOV-infected rodents. all animals in these studies were monitored for at least 28 d for illness. treatment of mice with combination of EBOV-specific PMOs slowed viral spread. infected cells were easily observed in the spleens of the mice treated with the scrambled PMO. C57BL/6 mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of EBOV following treatment with PMOs. immunoperoxidase stain showing presence of viral antigen is brown with hematoxylin counterstain. protective, PMO-treated mice were rechallenged with another dose of 1,000 pfu of EBOV 4 wk after surviving the initial challenge. all the mice were completely protected from the second lethal EBOV infection. guinea pigs treated with a single dose of the PMO combination 24 h before or 24 h or 96 h after EBOV infection. survival increased in guinea pigs receiving the treatment 96 h after EBOV infection (p = 0.029, compared with untreated guinea pigs) control guinea pigs were injected with 1,000 pfu of EBOV. guinea pigs were monitored for illness for 21 d. the data are presented as percent survival for each group. a third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9\u201314. the fourth PMO-treated monkey succumbed to EBOV infection on day 10. a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment. both the PMO-treated and nave monkeys exhibited thrombocytopenia. the levels in the surviving monkeys did not climb as high as those that succumbed to the infection. the levels in the surviving monkeys did not climb as high as those that succumbed to the infection. EBOV-specific PMOs demonstrated sequence-specific inhibition compared with a MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences. no inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 M concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets. OV VP24 (B), VP35 (C) and L (D) gene targets in cell-free translation assay. in vitro translation reactions containing different concentrations of PMO targeting EBOV (\u2022) or MARV () VP24, VP35, or L, respectively, or a scrambled () PMO. mice were treated with individual PMOs at 24 h and 4 h before challenge. both the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection. despite its strong activity in the cell-free translation assay, the L-specific PMO conferred survival to 30% of treated mice at the 500-g dose. OV-infected mice were fully protected at the 500-g doses. the post-challenge treatment provided enhanced protection. a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. survival of mice (n = 10) treated 4 h before (unfilled) or 24 h after (filled) EBOV infection with 500 g (square), 50 g (triangle) or 5 g (circle) of the combination of EBOV-specific PMOs or an unrelated sequence. there were no differences observed in survival within any of the groups between 14 d and 28 d. the viral titers in the spleen, liver, and kidney of the PMO-treated mice corroborated the observed pattern of antigen staining within the tissues. mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of EBOV following treatment with PMOs. PMO-treated mice were rechallenged with another dose of 1,000 pfu of EBOV 4 wk after surviving the initial challenge. all the mice were completely protected from the second lethal EBOV infection. mice that previously survived EBOV challenge were rechallenged with 1,000 pfu of mouse-adapted Ebola virus 4 wk after the initial challenge. results are plotted as percent survival for the PMO-treated mice (black) and nave control mice (n = 10 per group) tab Hartley guinea pigs weighing 400\u2013500 g each were treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg each of VP24, VP35, and L PMO in PBS at 24 (triangle), +24 (circle), or +96 (square) h post challenge. the guinea pigs were infected subcutaneously with 1,000 pfu of EBOV. treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy. two PMO-treated monkeys survived the EBOV challenge with few clinical signs beyond mild depression from days 6\u20139. a third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9\u201314. the monkeys that did not survive infection had detectable virus by day 5. both the PMO-treated and nave monkeys exhibited thrombocytopenia. levels in the surviving monkeys did not climb as high as those that succumbed to the infection. our current studies indicate the effectiveness of PMOs targeted to specific EBOV mRNAs against in vitro, rodent, and nonhuman primate EBOV infections. a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance. post-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents. post-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents. this is explained by the pharmacokinetic properties of PMO. the EBOV mouse model has several differences in pathogenesis compared with EBOV infection of nonhuman primates and humans. it is widely accepted as an appropriate model for rapid testing of potential antivirals before proceeding to NHP trials. antiviral efficacy in rodents may not always be predictive of efficacy in nonhuman primates. the results presented here have far-reaching implications for the treatment of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses. PMOs were designed with sequence homology near or overlapping the AUG translational start site of EBOV VP35. the protein coding sequence for firefly luciferase was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pCiNeo (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) in vitro translations were carried out by programming reactions with transcribed RNA at a final concentration of 1 nM. the average light units produced by the set of reactions for each treatment were normalized to the mean of all water-only control reactions. mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of mouse-adapted EBOV diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided autoclaved water and chow ad libitum. unless otherwise noted, mice were treated 2 at 24 h and 4 h prior to EBOV challenge. female rhesus macaques of 3\u20134 kg in weight were challenged with 1,000 pfu of EBOV-Zaire (1995 strain) the monkeys were treated from days 2 through day 9 via a combination of parenteral routes. the dose of the VP24 PMO was 12.5\u201325 mg at each injection, and the dose of the VP35 and L PMO ranged from 12.5\u2013100 mg per injection. blood samples were obtained under anesthesia by cardiac puncture for mice and from the femoral vein of monkeys. viremia was assayed by traditional plaque assay. after 5 h of culture, the cells were stained with anti-CD44, -CD8 or -CD4 (Pharmingen, San Diego, California, United States) after the cell surface staining, the cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, and stained with anti-IFN- PE. the PMOs were synthesized by AVI BioPharma, (Corvallis, Oregon, United States) the protein coding sequence for firefly luciferase, without the initiator-Met codon ATG, was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pCiNeo (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) the medium was removed from the cells and one multiplicity of infection of EBOV-Zaire was added to each well in 100 l of serum-free EMEM. after 1 h, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells washed twice with PBS. the PMOs were reintroduced for 2 hs in serum-free EMEM. mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of mouse-adapted EBOV. female guinea pigs, 400\u2013500 g in weight, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and quarantined at the US Army Research Institute for Infectious Diseases for at least 72 h before manipulations. all EBOV-infected animals were handled under maximum containment in a biosafety\u2013level-4 laboratory at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. all EBOV-infected animals were handled under maximum containment in a biosafety\u2013level-4 laboratory. blood was collected from the surviving mice or monkeys, respectively, 28 d after EBOV challenge. levels of EBOV-specific antibodies were determined from serum or plasma samples."}
