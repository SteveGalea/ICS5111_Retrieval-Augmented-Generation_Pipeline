{"summary": "Objective The rapid emergency alert communication in health trial was a randomized control trial to systematically compare and evaluate the effectiveness of traditional and mobile communication modalities for public health agencies to disseminate time-sensitive information to health-care providers. Methods Enrolled HCPs were blindly randomized into four message delivery groups to receive time-sensitive public health messages by e-mail, fax, or short message service (SMS) if an HCP did not provide a fax number on enrollment, s/he could still be randomized into the fax group. follow-up telephone interviews were conducted 5\u201310 days after delivery date. details regarding site selection, sampling, inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment and enrollment, randomization and blinding, messaging intervention, interview development, and intervention assessment have been reported elsewhere. analysis of relationship between exposure group and alert channel preference. chi-square test to determine differences between alert and advisory preferences. permutation test used 10,000 permutations to evaluate whether or not HCPs expressed a preference for receiving public health alerts and advisories. all analyses were un-blinded intent-to-treat analyses conducted using R version 2.13.0.30 Overall study design The REACH Trial was conducted from 2008 to 2012 in partnership with three public health agencies in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to systematically compare and evaluate the effectiveness of traditional and mobile communication modalities. the trial was conducted from 2008 to 2012 in partnership with three public health agencies in the u.s. Pacific Northwest. the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit health-care provider preferences for receiving alerts and advisories. serv performed separate permutation tests to evaluate if self-reported e-mail preference might impact preference. participants in control group excluded from this analysis. a total of 846 HCPs enrolled in the study. dCompleted interviews/providers enrolled eCompleted and partially completed interviews/(completed + partially completed interviews) + refusals HCP = health-care provider Alert channel preferences Overall, e-mail (71.0%) was the preferred mode of message delivery of public health alerts for most HCPs, followed by SMS (18.9%), then fax (10.1%). the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving public health alerts and advisories by e-mail, fax, or SMS. the three Pacific Northwest locations and timing of the study were Western Washington, February 2011; Montana, September 2012; and Eastern Washington, March 2012. the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving public health alerts and advisories. the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving alerts and advisories from public health agencies by e-mail, fax, or SMS. the three Pacific Northwest locations and timing of the study were Western Washington, February 2011; Montana, September 2012; and Eastern Washington, March 2012. cFisher's exact test dChi-square test HCP = health-care provider SMS = short message service. 27.3% of those HCPs who read at least one study e-mail message on their phone preferring SMS for alerts vs. 9.9% of those who did not read any study e-mail messages on their phone. Advisory channel preferences Overall, e-mail (82.9%) was the preferred mode of message delivery of public health advisories for most HCPs, aFigure does not include HCPs who did not answer both the alert and advisory questions (n=665) with either e-mail, fax, or SMS. the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving alerts and advisories. alert channel preference was related to exposure group among those not in the control group (chi-square test, p0.001) and held when examined separately for listserv membership (p0.001) and no listserv membership (p0.001). results indicated that HCPs were statistically more likely to express a preference for public health alerts. sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving public health alerts and advisories. sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving alerts and advisories from public health agencies. cBased on 10,000 permutations HCP = health-care provider SMS = short message service We also examined the relationship between key covariates (gender, age, provider type, listserv membership, and study site) and alert channel preference. older HCPs were more likely to prefer e-mail or fax, while younger HCPs were more likely to prefer receiving alerts by SMS. Advisory channel preferences Overall, e-mail (82.9%) was the preferred mode of message delivery of public health advisories for most HCPs, followed by fax (9.5%), then SMS (7.6%). e-mail (82.9%) was the preferred mode of message delivery of public health advisories for most HCPs. the trial was conducted from 2008 to 2012 in partnership with three public health agencies in the u.s. Pacific Northwest to systematically compare and evaluate the effectiveness of traditional and mobile communication modalities. the sub-study was conducted in the final quarter at each site to elicit HCP preferences for receiving alerts and advisories from public health agencies by e-mail, fax, or SMS. 4.5% of those HCPs who read at least one study e-mail message on their phone preferring SMS for advisor exposure effect is understood to play a role in preferences. this finding is consistent with our findings indicating that younger HCPs vs. older HCPs preferred SMS. health communications research supports tailoring communications by demographic and cultural variables to enhance the efficacy of distributed information. it is possible that public health messaging that matches content and communication channel to the preferences and changing preferences of its key audiences may not only make public health alerts and advisories more relevant and meaningful to HCPs. practitioners and physicians were not powered to analyze the influence of other covariates on preference. we were not able to test if an HCP's stated preference for receiving alerts or advisories through a specific communication channel might impact the effectiveness of a public health message."}
