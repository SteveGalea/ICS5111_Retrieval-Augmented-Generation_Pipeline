{"summary": "Background Swine influenza (H1N1) is a very contagious respiratory tract infection. the swine flu is a very contagious respiratory tract infection. the new infection is a very contagious respiratory tract infection. most patients have mild symptoms and those with severe symptoms (sepsis, pneumonia, ARDS) mostly had an underlying diseases. it was recognized that H1N1 may affect young previously healthy individuals. unlike other subtypes of influenza may cause severe symptoms in this age group. thirty-one of the patients enrolled in the study had an available chest-X ray. ten patients with more severe symptoms had an available CT scan. the patients\u2019 files were also reviewed regarding their previous medical condition. the extent of lung zone involvement was compared in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and patients in the ward. CT scans were also reviewed regarding the same abnormalities. CT scans were also reviewed regarding the same abnormalities. the mean age was 37.97 13.9 years (range, 18 to 76 years) there were 16 men (mean age, 30.06 13) and 15 women (mean age, 40 14.8 years) twelve patients with a mean age of 39.5 (66.7% women) were admitted to the ICU. seven had a predisposing condition (three cardiovascular disease, two respiratory disease, one immunodeficiency, one cancer, three others) four patients died. radiologic Findings of patients with the new Swine Flu Influenza. NO.
