{"summary": "SARS-CoV infected 8000 people in 2002\u20132003, with an average mortality of 10%. after July 2003, only a few community and laboratory-acquired cases have been reported. coronavirus replicase gene encoded within the 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome. a small integral membrane protein of 76 amino acids contains a short hydrophilic amino-terminus followed by a hydrophobic region and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminus [19]. HCoV-229E, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E proteins form ion channels permeable to monovalent cations [21], [22]. hsps can act independently of chaperoned peptides to directly stimulate innate immune responses. hsps can act independently of chaperoned peptides to stimulate innate immune responses, such as the maturation and activation of dendritic cells and the activation of natural killer cells. IRE-1 mediates the splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), leading to a frame shift and translation of a functional XBP-1 protein. the active transcription factor (sXBP-1) can then stimulate the transcription of genes encoding proteins that promote the folding, transport, and degradation of ER proteins. the ER stress response acts to restore ER homeostasis. protein on host cell responses during virus infection was analyzed for the first time using microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. we showed that SARS-CoV E protein influenced the expression of genes associated to stress response, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle and differentiation. the effect on stress response was most robust, based on both the number of differentially expressed genes regulating this activity. rSARS-CoV-E passaged 16 times in vero E6 cells (P16) was analyzed. this virus grew with titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV. rSARS-CoV-E-P16 contained only a single nucleotide substitution at amino acid 607 of the S gene (S607F) more than 90% of vero E6 cells were infected with rSARS-CoV-E or rSARS-CoV at 24 hpi. in the case of MA-104 cells, more than 80% of the cells were infected with both viruses at 24 hpi. growth kinetics of rSARS-CoV-E and rSARS-CoV showed similar profiles and titers. kinetics of the infection was slower in MA-104 than in vero E6 cells. rSARS-CoV and rSARS-CoV-E infected vero E6 and MA-104 cells. the results of the microarray analysis have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI, accession code GSE30589) only those genes showing significant expression changes (i.e., 2.0-fold and false discovery rate) at each time point were selected for further investigation. rSARS-CoV-infected cells included different isoforms of heat shock protein (hsp) and different genes encoding ubiquitins and chaperonins. not all cellular stress genes were differentially expressed in cells infected with SARS-CoV versus those infected with rSARS-CoV. genes differentially expressed in rSARS-CoV-E versus rSARS-CoV-infected vero E6 and MA-104 cells were classified according to their main biological functions. only genes with a fold change higher than two or lower than minus two (FDR0.01) were considered. red color indicates genes upregulated more than 10 fold, at least in one cell line. stress response proteins are differentially expressed in rSARS-CoV-E versus rSARS-CoV-infected cells. total protein from vero E6 (A) and MA104 (B) cells was extracted at 22 and 75 hpi. levels of hsp90 and hsp60 were normalized to those of GAPDH. similar (FDR0.01) changes in levels of genes related to cellular stress response to biotic stimulus, unfolded protein binding and protein folding were identified in both vero E6 and MA-104-infected cells. gene sets correlate with upregulated genes in rSARS-CoV-E compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells using microarrays. cellular RNAs were extracted at 22 (Vero E6) and 65 (MA-104) hpi. expression of cellular mRNAs corresponding to cytosolic, ER and mitochondrial stress genes was measured by qRT-PCR. number of genes with fold increases >2.5 measured by microarrays was further evaluated by qRT-PCR. changes in expression of these cytosolic stress genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. differences in gene expression were up to 23.4 or 13.0-fold greater for ER and mitochondrial stress, respectively. rSARS-CoV-E-p1 has an RNA genome sequence identical to that of the parental virus except for the deletion of gene E. gene compared to cells infected with virus expressing the E gene. mutation in gene S was not responsible for the observed differences in stress response. we transfected the E gene into rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells together with controls. expression of all analyzed stress-induced genes was clearly upregulated in cells infected with virus lacking E protein. expression of stress-related genes in the presence of E protein was clearly reduced. expression of the gene encoding DNA polymerase theta (polQ) was evaluated. expression levels of mRNAs encoding representative cell stress proteins were evaluated in rSARS-CoV-E-P1-infected cells. bars represent standard deviation of the mean from three experiments. effect of SARS-CoV E protein on the stress induced by RSV was analyzed. no significant effect of E protein expression on RSV titers was detected. cytosolic (genes hsp90 AA1, UBB, hspH1), ER (gene SERPINH1) and mitochondrial stress (gene hsp10 E1) were reduced. the stress induced by infection with at least two different respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV and RSV) the levels of E protein were monitored by Western-blot analysis. treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin induced the expression of ER stress genes in vero E6 and MA-104 cells transfected with the empty plasmid. no decrease in the expression of polQ gene was observed in the presence of E gene. levels of SARS-CoV E and GAPDH at 8 and 20 h post treatment in vero E6 cells were determined by Western blot. expression of stress induced genes, GRP78 and GRP94 ER and that of polQ and 18S rRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR in vero E6 (B) or MA-104 (C) cells. rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells were infected with rSARS-CoV with or without the E gene and RNA was collected at different times pi. RT-PCR was used to amplify fragments representing both the unspliced (u) and spliced (s) forms of XBP-1. levels of spliced XBP-1 were higher in rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells. rSARS-CoV-E infected cells from 15 to 28 hpi. rSARS-CoV induced low levels of apoptosis from 15 hpi. rSARS-CoV induced low levels of apoptosis from 15 hpi. rSARS-CoV-E triggered apoptosis more rapidly and to a greater extent than rSARS-CoV-E. rSARS-CoV-E-induced apoptosis levels in mock, rSARS-CoV-E and rSARS-CoV-infected cells were evaluated at 4 (A), 15 (B) and 24 (C) hpi by flow cytometry. both rSARS-CoV-E and the P16 were attenuated in the highly susceptible transgenic mice model. the deletion of the E gene, and not the amino acid substitution in S protein, was responsible for virus attenuation. the percentage of infected cells at 24 hours post infection was determined using an immunofluorescence assay. growth kinetics for rSARS-CoV-E and parental virus were similar. cytopathic effect in MA-104 cells was evident at 48 hpi. maximum virus titers were reached at 65 hpi. maximum levels of both types of viral RNA were observed at 15\u201322 hpi. fected cells at different times pi were determined by plaque assay. levels of intracellular genomic RNA in infected cells at different times pi as determined by qRT-PCR. annotated genes for rSARS-CoV versus mock-infected cells at 15 hpi compared to 1324 annotated genes at 7 hpi. number of genes differentially expressed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-E was reduced to 57 (Vero E6 cells) or 72 (MA-104 cells) at 15 or 65 hpi. different isoforms of hsp40, hsp70, and hsp 90 modified expression between 11.0 and +4.0-fold but to a similar extent in rSARS-CoV-E and rSARS-CoV-infected cells when compared with mock-infected ones. only genes with a fold change higher than two or lower than minus two (FDR0.01) were considered. differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, transcription, cell metabolism, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle and differentiation. these genes reduce the inflammatory response induced by viral infections by negatively regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. columns represent hsp90/GAPDH and hsp60/GAPDH ratios in rSARS-CoV-E (red) or SARS-CoV (blue) infected cells. all of the genes that were significantly upregulated in rSARS-CoV-E-infected compared to rSARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 and MA-104 cells were clustered in functional groups based on gene ontology differential expression of a wide set of cellular genes observed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV with or without the E gene was evaluated by qRT-PCR. differences in levels of this RNA were always lower than 1.5-fold and because the 18S rRNA has also been used successfully in similar reports. RNA from infected cell cultures was analyzed at different times pi (15, 22 and 28 hpi in the case of Vero E6 cells, and 24, 48, 65 and 75 hpi, in the case of MA-104 cells. rSARS-CoV-E-infected nineteen genes were upregulated at least 2.5-fold (FDR0.01) in rSARS-CoV-E compared to rSARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 virus without E protein was passaged 16 times, resulting in a virus with a 10-fold increase in titer, and a single point mutation in the S gene. total RNA from vero E6 cultures infected with the original viruses (P1) with or without E protein, and with the virus lacking E protein passaged 16 times, was extracted at 22 hpi. expression of stress genes hsp70 A1A, hsp90 AA1, hspH1, SERPINH1, and hsp10 E1 in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-E. expression of stress genes hsp70 A1A, hsp90 AA1, hsp90 AA1, SERPINH1, and hsp10 E1 was clearly upregulated in cells infected with virus lacking E protein expression of 18S rRNA was analyzed as an endogenous control for the amount of RNA in all samples. this data indicated that E protein reduced the stress caused by SARS-CoV infection. expression of stress response genes hsp90 AA1, UBB, hspH1, SERPINH1 and hsp10 E1 was analyzed in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV E protein. no significant effect of E protein expression on RSV titers was detected. intracellular RNA was extracted at 2 and 24 hours post-RSV infection. expression of cellular stress genes, polQ and 18S rRNA, was measured by qRT-PCR. each case, levels of expression in infected cells were compared to those in mock-infected ones. treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin clearly induced the expression of ER stress genes in vero E6 and MA-104 cells transfected with the empty plasmid. no decrease in the expression of polQ gene was observed in the presence of E gene. the effect of E protein on the three branches of the ER was analyzed. the PERK pathway involves the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of this kinase. the levels of phosphorylated PERK in rSARS-CoV-E and wt-infected cells were compared at different times pi. RT-PCR was used to amplify fragments representing both the unspliced (u) and spliced (s) forms of XBP-1 mRNA. levels of spliced XBP-1 were higher in rSARS-CoV-E-infected compared to rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells from 15 to 28 hpi. rSARS-CoV-E triggered apoptosis more rapidly and to a greater extent than rSARS-CoV. rSARS-CoV-E triggered apoptosis more rapidly and to a greater extent than rSARS-CoV. ining was performed to differentiate cells in early apoptosis (Annexin V+, PI) from those in late apoptosis (Annexin V+, PI+) rSARS-CoV-E is attenuated in vivo [26], [27]. a large number of genes corresponding to cellular stress were upregulated in rSARS-CoV-E compared to wt virus infected cells. rSARS-CoV-E is the most pathogenic human coronavirus known [70]. rSARS-CoV causes diarrhea [71], lymphopenia [72], haematological disorders [47], pulmonary vasculitis, and thrombosis [73], [74]. rSARS-CoV-E is cleared faster than rSARS-CoV with E protein [26], [27]. the presence of hsps on the cell surface facilitates the elimination of infected cells by natural killer (NK and T cell subsets) the presence of hsps on the cell surface facilitates the elimination of infected cells by NK and T cell subsets. ectopic expression of coronavirus E protein induces apoptosis in absence of infection [87], [88], whereas the expression of E protein in the context of SARS-CoV infection, limited the levels of apoptosis in infected cells. this is not surprising, as previous experiments were performed in transfected cells and not in the context of viral infection. inflammation has been associated with SARS-CoV-induced pathology [75], [76]. the upregulation of stress genes observed in rSARS-CoV-E-infected cells when the E gene was deleted probably diminished proinflammatory processes, leading to a decrease in pathology [94], [95]. rSARS-CoV and rSARS-CoV-E were rescued from infectious cDNA clones. only a single mutation, at position 23312, was detected in the rSARS-CoV-E passaged 16 times [56]. human hepatocarcinoma-derived PK15 cells were provided by A.
