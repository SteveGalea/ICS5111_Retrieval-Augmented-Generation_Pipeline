{"summary": "SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. PLpro inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. this finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction."}
