{"summary": "relapsing remitting (RR) MScl (85\u201390%) and primary progressive (PP) MScl (10\u201315%) can be divided into two major subtypes. proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. between 85\u201390% of patients can be classified as having the relapsing remitting (RR) MScl subtype, in which disease relapses are followed by periods of remission. 10\u201315% of all MScl patients are diagnosed with the primary progressive (PP) subtype. differentially abundant proteins identified by proteomics, such as apolipoprotein A1 [9] and chromogranin A [10], were validated by other techniques. in all currently reported proteomics CSF studies of MScl patients either only a single subtype of MScl patients or a combined group of all subtypes of MScl was studied. differences on a biological and pathological level could be very useful for elucidation of the biology and pathology of both disease types the healthy control CSF samples were taken from patients receiving spinal anesthesia prior to non-neurological minor surgical interventions. the samples were centrifuged to discard cells and cellular elements. the total protein concentration and albumin concentrations were also reported. the differentially abundant peptides were identified by nano-LC-ESI-Orbitrap MS. these measurements were carried out on a. Ultimate 3000 nano LC system (Dionex, Germering, Germany) online coupled to a hybrid linear ion trap/Orbitrap MS. 5 most intensive ions were consecutively isolated (AGC target set to 104 ions) and fragmented by collision-activated dissociation (CAD) applying 35% normalized collision energy in the linear ion trap. precursors were excluded for further MS/MS spectra for 3 minutes. if a hemoglobin peptide could be identified by nanoLC-ESI-Orbitrap (C18 column) with sufficiently high confidence score or if the mass peak 1274.7255 has a signal to noise of 4 or higher in MALDI-FT-ICR measurements, the sample was discarded from further analysis due to plasma/serum contamination. another blood specific protein, apolipoprotein B100 was checked in the same way as possible blood contamination. quantitative assessment of gel bands after photoluminescence was performed using Image J (freely available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). the medical Ethical Committee, de commissie medisch ethische vraagstukken, of the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, approved the study protocol and patients gave written consent. differentially abundant peaks (p0.01) were considered for identification purposes. the fold increase of every identified peptide with p0.01 was determined to confirm differential abundance between groups. peptides were eluted with following binary gradient: 0%\u201325% solvent B in 120 min and 25%\u201350% solvent B in further 60 minutes. solvent A consist of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. column flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. the number of allowed missed cleavages was 2, the mass tolerance for precursor ions was 10 ppm and for fragment ions 0.5 Da. the cut-off for mass differences with the theoretical mass of the identified peptides was set at 2 ppm. for the first protein, vitamin D-binding protein, we performed a commercially available ELISA (Immundiagnostik, Germany) according to the manufacturers specifications. for the second protein that was differentially abundant between the both MScl types, jagged-1, we performed a two-step western blot using goat anti-jagged1 antibodies. concentrations, age, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and disease duration are averages with standard deviation in brackets. none of the variables in these tables differed significantly between the groups (all t-tests showed p-values higher than 0.05) the comparison of RR MScl versus the controls had 41 peak masses with p-values lower than 0.01. seventeen of the peak masses with p-values with p0.01 were present in both comparisons. identification Identification of the differentially abundant peptides was performed by measuring all samples using the nanoLC-ESI-Orbitrap. PP MScl versus RR MScl showed a limited number of differentially abundant peptide peaks. of these peaks 7 were identified, the most notable being protein jagged-1.

PP MScl versus RR MScl showed a limited number of differentially abundant peptide peaks. of these peaks 7 were identified, the most notable being protein jagged-1. other proteins, such as serine/threonine kinase NLK, were more abundant in PP MScl than in RR MScl. vitamin D-binding protein 1 0.0092 ELPEHTVKLCDNLSTKNSK - 0 55 P61769 Beta-2-microglobulin 1 0.0014 VEHSDLSFSK - 70 0 P78504 Protein jagged-1 1 0.0087 TCMEGWM*GPECNRAICR 3.188 30 63 Q8IZF0 Sodium leak channel non-selective protein 1 0.0069 GKSLETLTQDHSNTVRYR 1.180 80 a t-test on the photoluminescence readout values of the original sample set showed a p-value below 0.05. the same comparison in the validation samples also showed a p-value below 0.05. the same comparison in the validation samples also showed a p-value below 0.05. protein jagged-1 (western blot) is more abundant in RR MScl than in PP MScl in the validation sample set (p = 0.041), based on the average (+/ standard deviation) in photoluminescence readout. six of the seven differentially abundant proteins (in red) identified in the comparison of the two MScl disease types (PP and RR) fit into a network related to neurological disease. the number of peaks with low p-values in the comparison of the two MScl types is lower than the number of background peaks. the difference between the two disease types appears undetectable by means of the univariate analysis. one of the peptides of protein jagged-1 is over three times less abundant in PP MScl and also is observed with a lower incidence in this group. network studies based on the quantitative expression levels of 20 genes in over one hundred individuals identify jagged-1 as a new therapeutic target for MScl and other autoimmune diseases. the identified peptide of vitamin D-binding protein is not observed in any of the PP MScl samples. vitamin D-binding protein has pleiotropic functions, beyond vitamin D metabolism. it can significantly enhance the chemotactic response to complement fragment C5a. the identification of a peptide of beta-2-microglobulin as differentially abundant is misleading. es had p-values below 0.01, which means that the values for the peptides of these two particular proteins are most likely due to other reasons than large abundance differences in these two proteins. for both of these proteins another peptide was identified with high p-value, indicating these proteins were likely not differentially abundant. ryanodine receptor 1 is involved in the maintenance of the calcium-equilibrium in brain tissue. ryanodine receptor 1 is involved in the maintenance of the calcium-equilibrium in brain tissue. the release of positively charged calcium ions may represent a key mechanism of axonal degeneration in disorders such as MScl. xls."}
