{"summary": "extrinsic sources of DNA damage are ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV) and genotoxic chemical agents. damage is capable of blocking DNA replication and transcription, leading to mutations or genome aberrations. so far more than ten UBLs have been identified. they include ATG8, FAT10, HUB1, ISG15, NEDD8, SUMO(1\u20134), UFM1 and URM1. reversible protein modification processes play important roles in regulation of key cellular processes. ISG15 is the product of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the first reported UBL (Haas et al., 1987) this 15-kDa protein consists of two ubiquitin-like domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions. this protein consists of two ubiquitin-like domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions. regulatory proteins involved in antiviral IFN signaling pathways serve as targets for ISG15 modification. mice lacking ISG15 or UBE1L exhibit increased susceptibility to infection by certain viruses. increased levels of ISG15 transcripts by about four fold in human skin fibroblasts. increase requires protein synthesis and a functional p53 protein. camptothecin-mediated induction of ISG15 is independent of IFN signaling pathway. negative regulators is disrupted by phosphorylation and acetylation, leading to stabilization and activation of p53. activated p53 then binds to p53REs for transcriptional activation of its target genes (e.g., BAX, CDKN1, and PUMA) that mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, depending on degree of stresses. HERC5 lacks p53RE, consistently with the finding that the ligase is not induced under DNA-damaging conditions. p53 ISGylation suppresses cell growth and tumor development in vivo. p53 ISGylation suppresses cell growth and tumor development in vivo. TAp63 isotypes can activate transcription from p53-responsive genes. of the p63 isotypes, Np63 has the transactivation inhibitory domain (TI) but lacks the TA domain. p63 is the most abundant p63 isotype in many proliferating epithelial cells. caspase-2 cleaves off the TI domain from ISGylated Np63. the cleaved TI domain is exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus. TAp63 is also ISGylated and cleaved by caspase-2. cisplatin, unlike camptothecin and doxorubicin, impairs the dominant-negative function ofNp63 toward TA domain-containing p53 family members. cisplatin is capable of inducing cAbl-mediated phosphorylation of TAp73, which causes the dissociation of TAp73 from Np63. PCNA ubiquitination triggers the replacement of replicative DNA polymerases, such as Pol, by damage-tolerant Y family of DNA polymerases. TLS polymerases bypass DNA lesion and therefore DNA replication can proceed without the need of removal of the damage and the risk of fork collapse. error-prone TLS polymerases have to be released from PCNA after DNA lesion bypass. ISGylated PCNA then recruits PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif-containing USP10. PCNA ligated with two ISG15 molecules in the same subunit. UBP43 is induced at a later period and cleaves off ISG15 molecules from PCNA. p53-mediated increase in levels of ISG15 and its conjugating system leads to ISGylation ofNp63 and PCNA. reversible PCNA ISGylation relays a signaling pathway to turn off error-prone TLS after DNA lesion bypass."}
