{"summary": "Fc receptors are membrane molecules expressed by several hematopoietic cells that recognize the Fc region of several immunoglobulin (Ig) classes and subclasses. the function of antibodies depends on one hand on their ability to recognize antigenic epitopes and on their dynamic flexibility and their capacity to interact with their cognate FcRs. cytokine, lipid mediator and superoxide production depend on the cell type and on outside-in signals induced by the ligand. involvement of the type I FcRs by immune complexes induces receptor aggregation followed by activation and recruitment of SFKs. phosphatases PTEN and SHIP1/2 regulate cellular levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 by hydrolyzing it to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2 respectively. monovalent targeting of FcR bearing ITAM motif induces the phosphorylation. the ITIM motif is defined by a single [I/V/L/S]xYxx[L/V] sequence. however, inhibition of cell activation by this motif requires co-ligation between the inhibitory and heterologous activating receptors by immune complexes promoting the recruitment of inositol phosphatases (SHIP-1 and SHIP-2) (6). hematopoietic cells favor development of various auto-immunes diseases. for example, the motheaten mice (mev/mev) express approximately 20% wild type activity of SHP-1, develop severe immune dysregulation and autoantibody production (17). it has been reported that Lyn is involved in positive and negative signals induced by antigen receptors (18, 19) y IgA (form of IgA dimers linked to the extracellular domain of the pIgR) in exocrine secretions to establish host-microbiota symbiosis. it may play a role in systemic and mucosal immunity. none of the B cells, T cells, monocyte/macrophages, or NK cells expressed this receptor irrespective of age, ethnic origin or gender. human type I and II Fc receptors bind antibodies in a two receptors-to-one antibody stoichiometry that may influence signal initiation (1). signaling through these receptors, however, is not yet documented as compared to type I FcRs. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported in the genes encoding activating FcRs (FcRIIA, FcRIIIA, and FcRIIIB) a SNP has been described which is associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (34, 35) neutrophils homozygous for the gene encoding the H131 variant show a higher capacity for IgG2-mediated phagocytosis than those homozygous for the gene encoding the H131 variant (41) patients with the R encoding allele were found to have more severe cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome infection. the 2B.4 promoter haplotype upregulates the expression of FcRIIB on neutrophils and monocytes that negatively correlate with lupus nephritis (46). this paradoxical association of the 2B.4 promoter haplotype suggests multifaceted impacts of FcRIIB in SLE that may depend on the affected cell types. polymorphism is characterized by a point mutation in the codon for residue 158, encoding valine (V158) or phenylalanine (F158) in the Ig-like domain near the membrane (34\u201336) the FcRIIIA-F158 variant has a higher affinity for all human IgGs than the FcRIIIA-F158 variant (40) pIgR has been reported as a susceptibility gene for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) associated with Epstein-Barr virus (65). this lead to a hypothesis that pIgR could be the nasopharyngeal epithelial receptor for EBV via IgA-EBV complex. eles and their expression and functions in physiology and pathology (42\u201344, 46, 48, 60, 60, 65, 66, 69, 72\u201383) eles and their expression and functions in physiology and pathology (42\u201344, 46, 48, 60, 60, 60, 65, 66, 69, 72\u201383) IgG 1/3/4\" Neutrophils/ Eosinophils/ Basophils Activation Wegener's granulomatosis (78) FcRI (CD89) IgAl, lgA2, CRP Monocytes/Macrophages Neutrophils/DCs/Kupffer cells (79) Activation/Inhibition 114T/C IgA nephropathy (60), AIDS, ankylosing spondylitis, IgAN, IgA nephropathy;

IVIG is used in treatment of several immunodeficiency diseases including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia a role for the inhibitory FcRIIB has been proposed to be exclusive in IVIG action to explain their Fc dependent effect. this statement was based notably on studies showing a decreased anti-inflammatory effect of IVIG in FcRIIB-deficient animals. human mIgA or anti-FcRI Fab fragments were used to prevent or treat collagen antibody-induced arthritis in FcRI-transgenic mice. mIgA reversed the activating ITAM to ITAMi signature and the state of inflammation in the synovial fluid isolated from RA patients. IgG would be degraded in lysosomes more quickly instead of being recycled back into circulation. one simple method would be to use recombinant soluble human FcRn to compete with membrane FcRn for IgG. another approach to block binding would be through engineered \"bait\" IgG. this recruitment induces a Lyn-dependent phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Y536 and to SHP-1 phosphatase activity that inhibits the recruitment of various proteins induced by heterologous receptors (52). in contrast, multivalent crosslinking of immunoreceptors by immune complexes induces the recruitment of both kinases Lyn and Fyn to the receptor leading to the activation and the recruitment of the kinase Syk. the absence of Fyn impaired multipolar-bipolar transition of newly generated neurons and neurite formation during the early phase of migration. the absence of Fyn decreased the branching number of the migrating cortical neurons. treatment of inflammatory synovial cells from RA patients by hFcRIIA-specific antibody inhibited production of reactive oxygen species associated with the induction of ITAMi signaling. anti-FcRI Fab and F(ab)\u20322 fragments also have demonstrated efficiency on RA (109). IVIG intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are harvested from the pooled plasma of 3,000 to 100,000 healthy donors. they consist of over 95% IgGs with a subclass distribution corresponding to that found in normal human serum (114). IVIG is used in treatment of several immunodeficiency diseases including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myas a role for FcRIII in IVIG-mediated inhibition has been reported. this statement was based notably on studies showing a decreased anti-inflammatory effect of IVIG in FcRIIB-deficient animals. mIgA treatment decreased significantly leukocyte infiltration to the inflamed joints of mice. mIgA reversed the activating ITAM to ITAMi signature and the state of inflammation in the synovial fluid isolated from RA patients. findings open new avenues to develop the concept of IVIgA. targeting of hFcRIIA by specific antibody such as clone IV.3 mAb could ameliorate RA-associated inflammation (11) targeting of hFcRI by blocking peptides or antibodies prevents neutrophil migration and tissue damage ex-vivo (110, 111) IVIG is used in treatment of several immunodeficiency diseases including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis (115). in ITP patients, administration of IVIG can efficiently attenuate platelet clearance from the circulation. these data are based on the in vitro targeting of FcRIIA and FcRIII by IVIG at the physiological concentration of IgG. this was confirmed by targeting FcRIIA or FcRIII with F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of specific antibodies. these results were further supported in vivo in mice by targeting these receptors with IVIG or with specific antibodies. a partial restoration of FcRIIB expression in B cells rescued mice from developing an SLE-like phenotype (57, 121) these antibodies have the potential to serve as novel immune suppressors in auto-immunity either by blocking B cell activation or by targeting their destruction. a blocking mAb would provide interference with FcRn-IgG interaction. one such mAb, 1G3, was examined in rat passive and active models of myasthenia gravis, a prototypical antibody-mediated auto-immune disease. the absence of Fyn favors the phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Y536 by Lyn. inhibition of PI3K prevents RA and lupus nephritis progression in mouse models. identification of new targets downstream of Fyn will permit development of new therapeutic strategies for auto-immune diseases that involve FcR. progress in these two aspects is currently well underway, already proposing new potent therapeutic tools."}
