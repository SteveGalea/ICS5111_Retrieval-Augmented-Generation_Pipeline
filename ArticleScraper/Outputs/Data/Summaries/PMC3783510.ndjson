{"summary": "introduction angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of the maternal copy of UBE3A. distinctive features of AS include frequent laughter and smiling, near absence of speech, and abnormal electroencephalogram patterns. the mammalian GA consists of closely arranged stacks of flat cisternae that sort and process nascent membrane proteins, secreted proteins, and lipids. loss of GA acidification disrupts GA morphology (van Vliet et al., 2003) under-acidification of the GA may contribute to the diverse plasticity and neurodevelopmental deficits reported in Ube3a-deficient mice and AS patients. the results define a novel function for Ube3a in maintaining Golgi ion homeostasis. gct caa ggt tgt atg cct tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc tgc.

GM130 immunoreactivity localized to slightly distended membranes adjacent to most severely swollen compartments. the morphological integrity of the GA was disrupted in the UBE3Am/p+ brain. the ER and nuclear membrane were structurally intact and indistinguishable from WT. despite moderately reduced Ube3a levels in UBE3Am/p+ cortex, the GA in UBE3A/ kidney contained swollen cisternae. there is GA swelling in UBE3A/ kidney (asterisk) and unaltered GA morphology in UBE3A/ kidney. clonal cells with stable RNAi KD of Ube3a have been extensively developed for cultured cells. we chose clone 9 cells, a rat normal liver cell line that is not tumorigenic. the phenotype in Ube3a KD cells was less severe than UBE3Am/p+ neurons in vivo. NT, nontransfected cells; KD, KD cells stably expressing shRNA against Ube3a; Ctrl, cells stably expressing a nontargeting scrambled shRNA. ns, not significant (p = 0.30). the ts045 temperature-sensitive mutant of the VSVGts-GFP was used to visualize cargo transport through the secretory pathway. VSVGts-GFP is retained in the ER at 39.5\u00b0C and released upon a switch to 32\u00b0C, allowing synchronized release of a bolus of fluorescent cargo from the ER. to selectively monitor post-Golgi secretory trafficking, we introduced a second temperature block at 20\u00b0C to accumulate VSVGts-GFP in the GA before cargo release. VSVGts-GFP progression from the ER to the plasma membrane through the GA was monitored after temperature-induced ER release. newly synthesized VAMP2-SEP is trafficked into dendrites (1), where it is exocytosed at the plasma membrane (2). it is then rapidly endocytosed (3) and retrafficked to the axon, where it accumulates at axonal terminals (4). VAMP2 is indirectly targeted to the axonal compartment via transcytosis. it is then rapidly endocytosed and retrafficked to the axon. despite its predominantly presynaptic localization, the trafficking route of newly synthesized VAMP2 allows direct imaging of the secretory exocytosis. the number of events per minute were counted and normalized to the dendritic length to calculate the exocytic event rate. there was no significant difference in the exocytic event rate between UBE3Am/p+ and WT neurons. this data show that there is not a generalized inhibition of cargo exit from the GA in the absence of Ube3a. nching of YFP by low pH provides a measure of intralumenal Golgi pH. we calibrated the YFP:CFP fluorescence intensity ratios to measurements obtained under defined pH conditions. in Ube3a KD cells, the GA pH was significantly elevated compared with control cells. yFP and CFP fluorophores are directed to the lumen of the GA using the Golgi targeting domain of -1,4-galactosyltransferase. YFP fluorescence increases as pH increases, while CFP fluorescence is pH stable. pER-CFP-YFP is a soluble protein targeted to the ER lumen by its N-terminal calreticulin signal sequence and C-terminal KDEL retrieval sequence. there is moderately elevated YFP intensity in the UBE3Am/p+ neuron compared with the WT neuron. pGolgi-CFP-YFP construct was first tested in 293T cells. results demonstrate that any interactions between fluorophores did not diminish the probe's ability to report Golgi pH. ER pH is modestly increased in UBE3Am/p+ neurons. YFP/CFP normalized to WT: WT 1.00 0.08, n = 4; UBE3Am/p+ 1.02 0.03, n = 6; p = 0.69. both WT and UBE3Am/p+ neurons were within the expected range for cytoplasmic pH. ER pH was moderately elevated in UBE3Am/p+ neurons over WT neurons. the elevation of Golgi pH by just 0.2 pH units is sufficient to disrupt the addition of sialic acid to glycan structures in a linkage-specific manner. enzymatic activity, trans-Golgi localization, and altered protein glycosylation are highly pH-sensitive. surface labeling using fluorescein-conjugated SNA revealed a marked reduction in surface sialylconjugates on Ube3a KD cells compared with control cells. we observed a sharp reduction in sialylconjugates in Ube3a KD cells (45.2 4.9% of control, n = 7; p 0.001; Fig. 6D,E) surface labeling of -2,6-sialic acid conjugates in control cells and Ube3a KD cells using SNA-fluorescein. neuraminidase abolished SNA labeling. there are reduced levels of high molecular mass sialylconjugates in Ube3a KD cells. species 50 kDa are nonspecific as they are present in the absence of ManNAz. be3a KD cells had a significant reduction in immunopurified sialylconjugates. these data indicate that cells lacking Ube3a have a marked reduction in surface sialylation, consistent with an under-acidified GA. altered Golgi ion homeostasis and defective glycosylation define a general defect in cells lacking Ube3a. we measured the abundance of SNA-reactive sialylconjugates in cortical lysates prepared from UBE3A/ and WT mice. we found a significant decrease in total protein -2,6-sialylation in Ube3a/ cortex relative to WT cortex. these results suggest there is a generalized deficit in sialylation in the Ube3a-deficent brain. we performed electron microscopy on WT, UBE3Am/p+, and UBE3A/ mouse visual cortex. the GA in UBE3Am/p+ and UBE3A/ neurons exhibited swollen, distended, and disorganized cisternae. the GA in UBE3Am/p+ and UBE3A/ mouse cortex contains enlarged and distended cisternae (asterisks), often adjacent to cisternae with normal morphology (black arrows) the morphological integrity of the GA was disrupted in the UBE3Am/p+ brain, the ER and nuclear membrane were structurally intact and indistinguishable from WT. there is GA swelling in UBE3A/ kidney (asterisk) and unaltered GA morphology in UBE3A/ kidney. the GA in mammalian cells is organized into characteristic stacks of narrow membrane-bound structures. to test for defects in Golgi function in the absence of Ube3a, we created clonal cell lines with stable RNAi KD of Ube3a. we chose clone 9 cells, a rat normal liver cell line that is not tumorigenic. altered Golgi morphology caused by loss of Ube3a is not specific to neurons. altered Golgi morphology caused by loss of Ube3a is not specific to neurons. VSVGts-GFP is retained in the ER at 39.5\u00b0C and released upon a switch to 32\u00b0C, allowing synchronized release of a bolus of fluorescent cargo from the ER. VSVGts-GFP is retained in the ER at 39.5\u00b0C and released upon a switch to 32\u00b0C. surface immunolabeling measured VSVGts-GFP accumulation at plasma membrane. kinetics of membrane accumulation were unaffected by loss of Ube3a. VSVGts-GFP progression from the ER to the plasma membrane was monitored. no significant differences were evident in VSVG surface accumulation between control cells and Ube3a KD cells. Upon leaving the GA, newly synthesized VAMP2-SEP is trafficked into dendrites. the trafficking route of newly synthesized VAMP2 allows direct imaging of the secretory exocytosis of a naturally occurring cargo at the somatodendritic membrane. the trafficking route of newly synthesized VAMP2 allows direct imaging of the secretory exocytosis of a naturally occurring cargo at the somatodendritic membrane. Discrete exocytic events in live VAMP2-SEP transfected neurons were identified by their transient flash-like appearance. the number of events (N) per minute were counted and normalized to the dendritic length to calculate the exocytic event rate. to measure GA intralumenal pH in live cells, we exploited the pH sensitivity of YFP and the relative pH insensitivity of CFP. we directed these fluorescent proteins to the lumen of medial/trans-Golgi cisternae by fusion with the Golgi targeting domain of -1,4-galactosyltransferase. the neutralized Golgi pH in Ube3a KD cells was substantially higher than any reported values in unperturbed cells. YFP fluorescence increases as pH increases, whereas CFP fluorescence is pH stable. pER-CFP-YFP is a soluble protein targeted to the ER lumen by its N-terminal calreticulin signal sequence. pER-CFP-YFP is a soluble protein targeted to the ER lumen by its N-terminal calreticulin signal sequence. we measured Golgi pH in cortical neurons cultured from UBE3Am/p+ mice. ER pH is modestly increased in UBE3Am/p+ neurons. we also measured the pH of the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and ER in UBE3Am/p+ and WT cortical neurons. the regulation of mitochondrial ion homeostasis is distinct from that of the secretory pathway. the mitochondrial inner matrix is alkaline with pH 8. ER pH was moderately elevated in UBE3Am/p+ neurons over WT neurons. increase in YFP:CFP intensity ratio of pER-CFP-YFP. a mechanism partially shared with other compartments of early secretory pathway. sialic acid to glycan structures in a linkage-specific manner. sialylation modulates interactions among proteins and lipids. thereby regulating cellular adhesion and cell signaling. similar results were obtained with SNA-fluorescein and SNA-HRP in a separate Ube3a KD clone tested. SNA-fluorescein signal normalized to control: KD2 20.0 2.7%, n = 4; p 0.001; SNA-HRP normalized to control: KD2 39.6 5.4%. manNAz, a synthetic azide derivative precursor to sialic acid, is incorporated into endogenous glycans (F1). there are reduced levels of high molecular mass sialylconjugates in Ube3a KD cells. species 50 kDa are nonspecific as they are present in the absence of ManNAz. we incubated cells with the synthetic sialic acid precusor N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz), which can be covalently tagged with a FLAG-phosphine conjugate. the species can then be isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody under denaturing conditions. cells lacking Ube3a have a marked reduction in surface sialylation, consistent with an under-acidified GA. we measured the abundance of SNA-reactive sialylconjugates in cortical lysates prepared from UBE3A/ and WT mice. we found a significant decrease in total protein -2,6-sialylation in Ube3a-deficient brain relative to WT cortex. activity in UBE3A/ cortical lysates normalized to WT. phenotype of distended Golgi cisternae in UBE3Am/p+ mouse cortex. phenotype is associated with marked under-acidification of the Golgi lumen. p+ mice are limited to the trans-Golgi network and accompanied by severely disrupted mitochondria. the swollen Golgi cisternae in SPCA1/ tissues are accompanied by rough ER dilation and embryonic lethality. multiple genetic associations with organellar ion homeostasis suggest a common set of cellular pathways whose disruption is sufficient to cause severe deficits in brain development. it will be important for future studies to define the relationship between Ube3a and the various molecular mechanisms regulating endomembrane pH and ion homeostasis. the acidic pH of the GA is achieved by balancing active acidification by vacuolar H+-ATPases with chloride influx, cation exchange, and a H+ leak current. an especially attractive mechanism would involve the organellar NHEs. these ubiquitously expressed (Na+,K+)/H+ exchangers concentrate in different subcellular compartments. inization impairs sialylation of diverse proteins and lipids. loss of Ube3a reduces protein sialylation in both Ube3a KD cells and mouse brain. in the brain, sialylation of proteins and lipids occurs in a developmentally regulated manner. several sodium and potassium ion channels significantly alter conductance\u2013voltage relationships. it will be interesting for future studies to determine whether reduced ion channel sialylation contributes to the stimulus-dependent long-term potentiation deficit. GA dysfunction can also disrupt dendritic branching and polarization. the role of organellar pH in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity remains poorly understood. a set of small-molecule inhibitors have been developed for the cell-surface targeted NHE1. a single mutation in a single gene is sufficient to cause the disease. lgi ion homeostasis and that Golgi under-acidification could underlie deficits in neuronal function and plasticity observed in mice and AS patients."}
