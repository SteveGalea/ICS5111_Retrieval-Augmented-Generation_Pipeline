{"summary": "upper respiratory infection (URI) is an endemic cause of morbidity in military training. adenovirus PCR was positive in 72% (96% serotype E-4) and 2009 H1N1 in 20%. females more likely to have 2009 H1N1 compared to adenovirus. despite high frequencies of adenovirus infection, coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 is rare and apparently does not result in increased morbidity. non-influenza related upper respiratory infections are universally experienced illnesses that, despite their typically self-limited nature, lead to billions of dollars of lost income. coinfections with viral pathogens including 2009 H1N1 have been described in patients with respiratory infections. few prospective studies have related these to clinical presentation and outcomes in adults since molecular diagnostics became available, and none in setting of high background rates of adenovirus. trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was administered during the first week of training throughout the study period, but 2009 H1N1 vaccine was not available until December 1, 2009. oseltamivir was routinely used for treatment of ill trainees with confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection. both respiratory viral culture and 2009 H1N1 PCR were performed on predominantly nasal wash specimens as part of routine clinical care. both respiratory viral culture and 2009 PCR were performed on predominantly nasal wash specimens as part of routine clinical care. the study was approved by the Wilford Hall Medical Center/Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board. the participation of active duty service members in a federal duty status is not subject to requirements regarding research involving children or minors. trainees receive chemoprophylaxis against Streptococcus pyogenes during first week of training. vaccinations against meningococcus, hepatitis A and B and measles, mumps and rubella are also administered during the first week of training. oseltamivir was routinely used for treatment of well trainees in close contact with a confirmed case. both respiratory viral culture and 2009 H1N1 PCR were performed on predominantly nasal wash specimens as part of routine clinical care. both respiratory viral culture and 2009 H1N1 PCR were performed on predominantly nasal wash specimens as part of routine clinical care. a specimen was considered positive if its cycle of threshold (Ct value) was equal to or less than 40. the study was approved by the Wilford Hall Medical Center/Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board. men constituted 89% of the study population. median age was 20 years (IQR 19\u201322), and 69% were white. adenovirus PCR was positive in 72% of subjects and 20% were positive for 2009 H1N1 by PCR. adenovirus was found alone in 58, 2009 H1N1 alone in 51, and 9 were coinfected. subjects with 2009 H1N1 were much less likely to be adenovirus positive than those without 2009 H1N1 (13% vs. 81%). adenovirus was detected in 60% of female subjects vs. 74% of male subjects. adenovirus detections peaked earlier in the year compared to 2009 H1N1 infections. the distributions of the epidemic curves were similar and both peaked in the fifth week. adenovirus detections peaked earlier in the year compared to 2009 H1N1 infections. physical exam revealed increased abnormal findings on throat exam in the adenovirus group. there were no differences in pneumonia or hospitalization rates between the two groups. hea 21 (5.6%) 20 (7.8%) 0 0.03 0 0.62 Duration of symptoms (days; IQR*) 3 (2\u20134) 3 (2\u20135) 2 (2\u20133) 0.01 2.5 (2\u20133) 0.09 Vital Signs** Heart Rate 94.1 (14.1) 93 (15) 97 (12) 0.08 95 (10) 0.71 Respiratory Rate 17.0 (1.8) 17 (2) 17 (1) 0.92 17 (2) 0.37 Systolic BP*** 119.6 (9.3) 120 ( oral temperature on presentation was higher for the coinfected group than for those infected with adenovirus alone. there were no hospitalizations or diagnoses of pneumonia in the coinfection group. this was not significantly different than the rates seen in the adenovirus group. study of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients found only six patients with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 coinfection out of over 8000 subjects enrolled. it is also unclear if there is a negative association between the two viruses, whether adenovirus is protective against influenza infection or vice versa. males represented 89% of the study population, enrolled after presenting with respiratory illness. males generally represent only 80% of the air force basic training population. the reasons for this gender difference are unclear. 1N1 influenza virus PCR was done as part of clinical care. there could have been some differences in those who enrolled vs. did not enroll. inferences about the impact of H1N1 towards the end of 2009 are limited."}
