{"summary": "the first case of MERS was reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012 in a patient with severe respiratory illness and acute kidney injury. the 2014 outbreak of MERS in Saudi Arabia raised the concern that this virus has mutated and become more transmissible or virulent. a probable case is a patient with acute febrile illness for which testing is inconclusive or not available. a probable case is a patient with acute febrile illness for which testing is inconclusive or not available. the patient either has a direct epidemiological relation with confirmed MERS-CoV case or resides in or travelled to the Middle East. 11 out of 12 critically ill patients of MERS had extrapulmonary manifestations with shock. one patient presented with fever, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain without any respiratory symptoms. 45 patients out of 47 had other co-morbidities including diabetes. LABORATORY FINDINGS Common laboratory findings of MERS include leucopaenia, consumptive coagulopathy, raised creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase and deranged liver enzyme levels. there is no specific treatment for MERS and supportive treatment remains the mainstay of management. patients with MERS should be placed in negative pressure rooms or in rooms in which room exhaust is filtered through high-efficiency particulate air filters. airborne preventive measures with at least six air changes per hour should be used in treatment rooms. SUMMARY MERS is a disease with pandemic potential but many questions regarding epidemiology, pathogenicity, transmission and management are still unanswered. global awareness of MERS along with surveillance for MERS-CoV should be increased to prevent further outbreaks."}
