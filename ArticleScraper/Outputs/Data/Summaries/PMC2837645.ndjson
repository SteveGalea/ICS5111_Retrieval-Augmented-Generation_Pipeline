{"summary": "live poultry markets (LBM's) contribute to the epidemiology of avian influenza due to their demographic characteristics and the presence of HPAI H5N1 virus lineages. relationship between poultry producers and live poultry traders (LPT's) that operate in LBM's has not been adequately documented in HPAI H5N1-affected SE Asian countries. five epidemic waves of HPAI H5N1 occurred in Vietnam between late 2003 and mid-2008. the majority of outbreaks are recorded in the predominant small-holder chicken and duck flocks. the daily outbreak incidence during the first two epidemic waves peaked around the annual \"Tet\" holiday festivities. a virological survey in ten live bird markets in ha Noi has shown that the HPAI H5N1 virus was already circulating in healthy geese as early as 2001 [18,23] the virus found in 2005 in Ha Noi's live bird markets have been reported to be genetically related to virus isolated in 1997, but are genetically distinct from those isolated in northern Vietnam in early 2004 [18,25,26] this supports the hypothesis that separate virus introductions via trade of live poultry might be responsible for different outbreak a poultry trade network of northern Vietnam does not provide substantive evidence on the association between production and trade in smallholder poultry. the findings suggest that more experienced LPT's tend to trade in retail markets. the number of communes visited by LPT's was not large (maximum: 4) nor was the number of contact flocks in them. authorised live bird markets serving the northern provinces of Vietnam.

0.123) there are five communes linked to more than one LBM. this study represents the first investigation of the association between poultry trade and HPAI outbreaks in northern Vietnam. the results of this study highlight the advantage of combining a descriptive study with a network analysis of the characteristics of the poultry trade pattern of LPT's. this methodology can improve our understanding of the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 in affected countries. a poultry traceability scheme would provide a mechanism for monitoring and regulating the traffic of live poultry in and out of the LBM's. the links between specific communes in northern Vietnam were described using social network analysis. increasing numbers of LPT's operating in communes does not increase the risk of AI outbreaks. the observed outbreak pattern in 2003-06 appeared to be associated to subgroups of LPT's. only a few communes (n = 5) traded poultry in both retail and wholesale markets. this contrasts to 40.5% infection level amongst the other communes. market selection was based on a history of recurrent HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. the \"buy only\" was underrepresented because individuals leaving the LBM with live poultry do not have to report at the market veterinary check point. however, it is very difficult to deal with the uncertainty of the contact structure and its stability. disease control policies based on flock depopulation consider village level depopulation as the main control measure for containing local virus dissemination. this decision represents a compromise between logistic constraints of disease control and the known heterogeneity of poultry flocks among the approximately 16,000 communes of Vietnam. data recording systems should include regular data capture by the MIs. these interventions should be combined with enhanced flock-level biosecurity and disease monitoring and evaluation strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the modification of the LPTs' trade patterns. a cross-sectional survey was carried out in all 12 markets between December 2006 and March 2007. it corresponds to peak poultry movement in Vietnam due to high poultry demand. a total of 80,000 poultry are traded daily in these markets. the survey elicited information from 157 incoming and outgoing LPT's. the survey elicited information from 157 incoming and outgoing LPT's. the survey elicited information from 157 incoming and outgoing LPT's. 117(82%) LPT's were operating in eight LBM's. the remaining four markets (Dong Ngac, Ngoc Hoi, Ngu Hiep and Tan Trieu) were visited by the 18 LPT's for which the location information was incomplete. all factors significant in the screening phase were re-categorized into their quartiles. the criterion for removal of risk factors was based on the likelihood ratio statistic with a significance level of p > 0.05. the eliminated variable was assumed to be a confounder and forced into the model. normalized degree measures the absolute number of unique links of a given node to the other node class. a binary variable was created identifying the communes included in the giant weak component (Yes/No) a symmetrised binary clique-overlap network (Network 3) was built where two communes are connected if they share at least one clique. the test of autocorrelation for Network 2 and 3 compared the observed number of links between two groups of nodes and the expected number obtained through random permutations of the network. the association between disease status and membership in the giant component and the degree of commune in the Network 4 was tested using the Pearson's Chi-square test and the Fisher exact test. a total of approximately 80,000 poultry are traded daily in these markets. this is estimated to represent approximately 75% of the total number of poultry traded during a day in the northern provinces of Vietnam. the survey elicited information from 157 incoming and outgoing LPT's. we did not limit the number of flocks a LPT could name. the data on avian influenza outbreaks in Vietnam from 2003 through 2006 was provided by the Epidemiology Unit of the Department of Animal Health. the association between the LPT's and the H5N1 infection status of communes where flocks were located was considered as the outcome variable. the explanatory variables included \"market type\" vs. \"retail\" markets, \"time trading poultry\" and \"direction of poultry trade\" the effect of clustering due to multiple measurements at LPT's was assessed by including this variable as a random effect. social network analysis was used to describe the connectivity pattern within the dataset consisting of records of paired trading events. each pair represented the link between a particular LPT or LBM and the commune in which the source flock of the purchased poultry was located. two symmetric 2-mode networks, valued and binary (Network 1), were built linking LPT's and communes so that two communes are linked via a LPT. two 2-mode symmetric networks, valued and binary, were built linking communes and markets. Communes with degree greater than one were identified as a proxy for the identification of communes within the catchment area of more than one market. the association between disease status and membership in the giant component and the degree of commune in the network 4 was tested using the Pearson's test. all social network analyses were performed using UCINET 6.135. maps of the study area and the location of the communes included in the networks were produced using ArcView 9.2 (ESRI) authors' contributions RJSM designed the study, conducted the analysis and drafted the manuscript.
