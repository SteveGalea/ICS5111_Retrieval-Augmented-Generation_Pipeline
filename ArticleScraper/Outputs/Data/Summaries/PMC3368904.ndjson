{"summary": "the family consists of three members, IFN-lambda1 (IL-29), IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A), and IFN-lambda3 (IL-28B) all three IFN-lambdas utilize a common distinct receptor, the IFN-lambdaR, which is composed of the IL-10R2 chain and the unique IL-28Ralpha chain [2], [3]. ambdaR induces the phosphorylation of STAT 1 and STAT 4 [1], [4], i.e. transcription factors involved in the development of IFN-gamma/Th1 responses. the main T-cell immune-modulatory function of IFN-lambda1 that has been reported is in dampening Th2 responses, in particular IL-13 [11]\u2013[13]. inactivated HHV-6B induces IFN-alpha and IFN-lambda1 responses in cord pDC via TLR9. inactivated HHV-6B also induces high levels of IFN-lambda1 from pDC. lack of induction of IFN-lambda2 was not dependent on the kinetics. the levels of IFN-alpha (A; n = 20), IFN-lambda1 (B; n = 15) and IFN-lambda2 (C; n = 5) were analyzed in 24h culture supernatants. data are expressed as mean + SEM. neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha blocked the HHV-6B-induced IFN-gamma responses while neutralizing antibodies to IFN-lambda1 did not have this effect. HHV-6B-induced dampening of IL-5 and IL-13 responses in cord mixed lymphocyte reactions. supernatants were collected after 48 h and analyzed for IFN-gamma (A), IL-5 (B) and IL-13 (C) content. data are expressed as medians and the 25% and 75% percentile (the boxes) with the minimum and maximum responses for n = 5. not IFN-lambda1 promote Th1 responses and block Th2 responses in activated cord CD4+ T-cells. supernatants were collected after 48 h and analyzed for IFN-gamma (A), IL-5 (B) and IL-13 (C) content. inactivated HHV-6B induces IFN-alpha and IFN-lambda1 responses in cord pDC via TLR9. inactivated HHV-6B also induces high levels of IFN-lambda1 from pDC. lack of induction of IFN-lambda2 was not dependent on the kinetics. purified cord pDC were exposed to inactivated HHV-6B. levels of IFN-alpha (A; n = 20), IFN-lambda1 (B; n = 15) and IFN-lambda2 (C; n = 5) were analyzed. the CD4+ T-cell production of IFN-gamma was increased while the production of IL-5 and IL-13 was decreased in MLR cultures exposed to HHV-6B. Neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha blocked the HHV-6B-induced IFN-gamma production and also the HHV-6-induced dampening of IL-13 responses. supernatants were collected after 48 h and analyzed for IFN-gamma (A), IL-5 (B) and IL-13 (C) content. data are expressed as medians and the 25% and 75% percentile (the boxes) IFN-lambda1 promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 responses in activated cord CD4+ T-cells. supernatants were collected after 48 h and analyzed for IFN-gamma (A), IL-5 (B) and IL-13 (C) content. activated cord blood mononuclear cells were analyzed for IL-28Ralpha expression (histograms) on pDC (A) or CD4+ T-cells obtained directly upon isolation (B) or after 24 h incubation with anti-CD3 (C) or recombinant human IFN-alpha (D) pDC produce higher amounts of IFN-lambda1 compared to IFN-lambda2 in response to HHV-6B exposure. both the IFN-alpha and the IFN-lambda1 responses induced by HHV-6B are mediated through TLR9. the lack-of-effect of anti-IFN-alpha in enhancing the Th2 responses in the HHV-6B-exposed cord MLR could imply that other factors than IFN-alpha also has a Th2-dampening effect. we recently showed that enveloped viruses (in this case coronavirus, CMV, HSV-1, influenza virus and morbillivirus) blocked IL-13 responses in vitro. we conclude that IFN-lambda1 does not have direct effects on CD4+ T-cells. this is in line with a recent report by Arasteh et al [24] showing that IFN-lambda2 has no effect on CD25 expression or proliferation of cord CD4+ T-cells. ambda blocks IL-13 responses and blocks Th2 and Th17 responses in vivo. the effects could be transferred by IL-28A-treated CD11c+ cells. HHV-6B infection is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of allergic sensitization. the virus was grown in MOLT-3 cells (available at ATCC: CRL 1552) in Iscoves complete medium. the virus-containing supernatants were then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000g. the cells were cultured in 96 well flat-bottom Nunc tissue culture plates. they were pre-coated with 3 ug/ml anti-human CD3 (3 ug/ml, OKT-3, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ) the cells were cultured in 96 well flat-bottom Nunc tissue culture plates. -lambda1, IFN-lambda2, and IL-13 levels were determined using specific duoset ELISAs (R&D) the data were analysed using the FCAP array Software (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) 106 cells were analyzed directly upon isolation or after 24 h incubation with IFN-alpha (5 ug/ml) or solid-phase anti-CD3 (3 ug/ml) mM DTT, 1x FirstStrand buffer and 200 U/l SuperscriptRT were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 50 minutes, followed by termination of the reaction at 70\u00b0C, 15 min. each qPCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 l containing 10 ng cDNA, 0.9 M of each primer and 0.25 M probe. virus was grown in MOLT-3 cells (available at ATCC: CRL 1552) in Iscoves complete medium. suspensions were centrifuged at 1500 rpm. virus-containing supernatants were then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000g. the cells were cultured in 96 well flat-bottom Nunc tissue culture plates. the cells were pre-coated with 3 ug/ml anti-human CD3. supernatants were collected after 48 h and analyzed for cytokine content.
