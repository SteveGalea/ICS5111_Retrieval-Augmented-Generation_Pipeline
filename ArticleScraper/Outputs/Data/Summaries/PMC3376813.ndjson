{"summary": "FECV strain RM and FECV strain UCD were propagated in specific pathogen\u2013free cats. the presence of feline infectious peritonitis in the cat was pathologically confirmed. cats originated from 144 different catteries and single- and multicat households. RNA isolated from organs or ascites of cats with feline infectious peritonitis. samples with results positive for FCoV were checked for the virus serotype. only samples positive for serotype I FCoV were included in this study. 96-well plates of degenerate primers were designed using a computational PCR primer design pipeline. the pipeline was developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) to produce tiled amplicons with an optimal length of 550 bp. a program was used to annotate de novo assemblies of coronaviruses sequenced at JCVI. we manually inspected the gene predictions before loading them into the annotation database at JCVI. the gene predictions were exported in formats acceptable to the national center for biotechnology information. the genomes were fully sequenced in a study to distinguish virulent from nonvirulent feline coronaviruses. FECV strain RM and FECV strain UCD (FECV UU2) were propagated in specific pathogen\u2013free cats. fecal material from apparently healthy cats was obtained from the rectum by using a cotton swab. the supernatant was cleared (centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 g) and then used for RNA extraction. PCR cycling conditions were 30 cycles at 94\u00b0 for 60 s, at 50\u00b0 for 30 s, and at 72\u00b0 for 1 min plus a 7-min extension at 72\u00b0 at the end of the reaction. all enzymes were used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. sequencing reactions were performed by using a 3730 ABI sequencer. raw sequence data were trimmed to remove any primer-derived and low-quality sequence. gene sequences were assembled by using viral assembly tool. multiple-sequence alignments were constructed by using the Lasergene MegAlign and MEGA4 software programs. for each nucleotide or amino acid position, we determined the rate at which FIPVs differ from all FECVs at that position. a full genome sequencing program of FECVs found in the feces of apparently healthy cats and of FIPVs found in organs or ascites of cats with pathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis. after the sequences of 11 genomes of each pathotype were completed, we performed a comparative FECV\u2013FIPV analysis. 9 of the FIPVs were not found in any of the FECVs. nt positions are shown on the x-axis; y-axis indicates number of FIPV genomes for which identity at nt position differed from identity at same position in all FECV genomes. 183 FECV and 118 FIPV RNAs isolated from different cats were sequenced in this specific region. 96 (81.4%) had a T and 12 (10.2%) a C at this position. the virus were sequenced in a study to distinguish virulent from nonvirulent feline coronaviruses. we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the translated partial amino acid sequences. we observed a small but distinct second cluster B in addition to the major cluster A constituted by the FIPVs having leucine at position 1058 in their S protein. this smaller cluster, formed by 5 (4.2%) of the sequenced FIPVs, appeared to be characterized by the occurrence of an alanine at position 1060. mutations in feline infectious peritonitis virus spike protein of cats with wet and dry forms of FIP* were established by sequencing. the occurrence and nature of the mutation in the spike gene was established by sequencing. a difference was detected 1 at 1,914 positions, 2 at 945 positions, 3 at 87 positions, 4 at 15 positions, and 5 at 1 position. the nucleotide identity in 9 of the FIPVs was not found in any of the FECVs. all FECV S proteins have a methionine at position 1058, but a leucine is encoded in the 9 FIPVs. RT-nPCR method amplify and analyze the genomic region covering nucleotides 23442\u201324040 for the first PCR run and nucleotides 23451\u201323593 for the second run. phylogenetic analysis of the partial nucleotide sequences accumulated by the RT-nPCR procedure. but the results did not enable further differentiation. 108 of the 118 sequenced FIPVs may be responsible for the virulent phenotype. onaviruses (FECVs) obtained by using reverse transcription nested PCR. clade A comprises FIPVs containing the M1058L mutation. clade B comprises FIPVs containing the S1060A mutation. virulence mutations detected in serotype I FCoV spike occur in the membrane-proximal domain of the protein. in coronaviruses, the S protein functions in cell entry; it is responsible for receptor attachment and membrane fusion. fusion peptide is located just upstream of the membrane-distal heptad repeat region. 4% of cases may also occur in the fusion peptide of the S protein. if mutations are all that is needed to convert a nonvirulent FECV into a lethal FIPV, the question arises as to why feline infectious peritonitis occurs so often. our discoveries of the critical differences between FECVs and FIPVs are clearly only a small step toward understanding the pathogenetic phenomena of feline coronavirus infections."}
