{"summary": "the patent system stimulates innovation only where industry sees the opportunity for increasing sales and market share. a study published in the Lancet in 2002 showed 68% of all new chemical entities marketed worldwide in the last 25 years were me-too products. the average price of the fifty drugs most used by senior citizens in America was nearly $1,500 for a year's supply in 2002. patents, with their focus on maximizing profits, have at least three negative consequences. patents, with their focus on maximizing profits, have at least three negative consequences. the TRIPS Agreement provides 20 years of patent protection on pharmaceuticals. the treaty would promote a health-needs-driven approach to drug discovery. the reward for innovation should be proportional to the reward for innovation. the treaty would have to meet the two crucial requirements for an effective system. a new funding mechanism is urgently needed to support R&D on an ongoing basis, particularly for neglected diseases. governments should require access to the compounds and tools that result from public research in order to stimulate follow-on innovation elsewhere. around 60,000 people die from Afican sleeping sickness every year. around 60,000 people die from afican sleeping sickness every year. a new funding mechanism is urgently needed to support R&D. non-profit organization is an effort to develop new innovation systems for market failures and neglected priorities. technology exchange frameworks could include licensing agreements with developing countries, or affirmative commitments of research funds for collaborative projects with these countries. treaty on health R&D should also promote partnerships between countries in the developing world. countries already contribute significantly to global R&D through the purchase of costly patented drugs. not-for-profit initiatives working to develop new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for neglected diseases should be funded at levels that enable them to reach their objectives. the successful adoption of a treaty on plant genetic resources shows that it can be done. the concept is already being aggressively opposed. civil society will be crucial to defend these health improvement strategies."}
