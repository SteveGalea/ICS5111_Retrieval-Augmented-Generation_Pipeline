{"summary": "maternal mobile messaging service (Kilkari) is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age\u2013appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones. mobile academy is an interactive voice response audio training course for accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in India. machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that aims to allow computers to learn automatically from the analysis of large, highly granular datasets. models are created using existing data to make predictions about future events. applications of machine learning in global public health are emerging, particularly in the context of digital health solutions. in this paper, we outline methods proposed for the application of machine learning to the evaluation of two large-scale mHealth initiatives in India. mHealth is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age\u2013appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones. Aim 2: Facilitate the program\u2019s ability to identify and target ASHAs likely to perform poorly on digital health training programs and knowledge assessments Objective 2a. Determine predictors of training course completion (overall and time to completion) by ASHAs based on performance on early modules of the course and other characteristics including reported motivation, knowledge, individual characteristics, and mobile literacy. data collected include personal identifiers such as geographic location, names of women and a mandatory mobile phone number. data capture happens at two key time points: (1) the earliest is the registration of the woman at the time of the identification of pregnancy, and (2) following childbirth, when the details for delivery care are available. the data will be analyzed under a data sharing agreement with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India and the ministries of health of the states participating in the program. the data will be analyzed under a data sharing agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. the IVR system validates the phone number against the MOTECH system and then retrieves the \u201cbookmark\u201d information that details the status of the ASHA and her progress on the list of content expected to be covered. analysis The data from the databases (Figure 1) will be extracted onto secure password-protected hard drives from each server storage. additional data from baseline surveys of evaluation of Kilkari and mobile academy Analyses described in this section are being carried out as part of a larger external evaluation of Kilkari. additional data from baseline surveys of evaluation of Kilkari and mobile academy Analyses described in this section are being carried out as part of a larger external evaluation. the data will be split into training and testing groups. this is possible due to the large size of the dataset. the training set will comprise 60%, the test dataset 20%, and the validation dataset 20% of the data. supervised machine learning algorithms are expected to be the primary analytic method employed because analyses are focused on classification using predictors. the transformation of variables may be achieved by a variety of techniques including the creation of composite indicators and box-cox transformations. principal components analysis or K-means clustering will be carried out as appropriate. two algorithms, Kilkari and Mobile Academy, function as \u201cengines\u201d for running the program Physically located in Railtel data center, Gurugram, Haryana Kilkari: Activation date Deactivation date Calls answered Duration of content heard per message Mobile Academy: Course start date Course completion date Notification retry count Course passing date Kilkari: Duration of enrollment in the program Status of enrollee Mobile Academy: Time taken to finish course Performance score of ASHA Number of tries by ASHA to complete modules DB the preferred analytic approaches will be selected based on their ability to minimize the total error of the classification. we describe each approach considered below in lay terminology, along with indications for use, and its proposed application in the evaluations of Mobile Academy and Kilkari. NNs are powerful models for machine learning. they are a generalization of linear and nonlinear models. they are a generalization of linear and nonlinear models. model attributes Decision trees NNs Nave Bayes SVM Linear discriminant analysis Logistic regression Accuracy in general ++ +++ +++ +++ ++ Speed of learning with respect to number of attributes and number of instances +++ + +++ + Speed of classification ++++ ++++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ model metrics Formulaa Description Accuracy (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FN) Proportion of cases correctly classified Precision or positive predictive value TP/(TP+FP) Fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances Sensitivity or recall TP/(TP+FN) Fraction of relevant instances over total amount of relevant instances Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) A value of 1 represents perfect accuracy while 0.5 means the prediction is worthless. data sources and Flow Auxiliary nurse midwives collect and register details of pregnant women and postpartum women and children born in their catchment areas. these data are captured in print registers and uploaded at the block level by data entry operators, forming the data in the pregnancy tracking databases. data from the MCTS and MCTS databases are pulled into the MOTECH database on a predetermined schedule every day. the data will be analyzed under a data sharing agreement with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the government of India and the ministries of health of the states participating in the program. the MOTECH engine captures data on ASHAs from the RCH or MCTS databases and used to register them to Mobile Academy. the system validates the phone number against the MOTECH system and then retrieves the \u201cbookmark\u201d information that details the status of the ASHA and her progress on the list of content expected to be covered. a decision was made to remove this feature in 2017 (july 28 for RCH and October 6 for MCTS) due to the complexity it created in analyzing system-generated data. the merging of datasets will occur in India, and only de-identified data will be stored on the hard drives. additional data from baseline surveys of evaluation of Kilkari and mobile academy analyses are being carried out as part of a larger external evaluation of Kilkari. data processing and analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to understand the distribution of each variable, including skewness and outliers. Efforts to prepare the data are divided into two parts: splitting data into training and testing groups, and data processing. this is possible due to the large size of the dataset. training set will comprise 60%, the test dataset 20%, and the validation dataset 20% of the data. the final selected model will be applied to the validation dataset. subsets will be equally represented across different time periods. principal component analysis uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. each succeeding component accounts for the highest variance possible after accounting for the previous components. as registered ASHAs Database works in conjunction with two algorithms, Kilkari and Mobile Academy, which function as \u201cengines\u201d for running the program Physically located in Railtel data center, Gurugram, Haryana Kilkari: Activation date Calls answered Duration of content heard per message Mobile Academy: Course start Date Course completion date Chapter wise scores Notification retry count Course passing date Kilkari: Duration of enrollment in the program Status of enrollee Mobile Academy: Time taken to finish course Performance score of ASHA Number of classification of ASHA workers by user characteristics and patterns of training initiation and completion User characteristics associated with exposure to messaging content and duration 5 Nave Bayes Classification model based on probabilities Classification of ASHA workers by user characteristics and patterns of training initiation and completion User characteristics associated with exposure to messaging content and duration 6 Neural Networks (NNs) SVM and NNs are expected to perform better with continuous data. the Nave Bayes method and decision trees perform better with discrete/categorical variables. NNs and NNs have difficulty handling irrelevant and redundant attributes. in step 1, algorithms will be run using the training dataset comprising 60% of the total sample from across all states for which data are available. for each algorithm, iterative testing will be run to select the best model that fits the data. for each algorithm, algorithms will be run using the training dataset comprising 60% of the total sample from across all states for which data are available. TP/(TP+FN) Fraction of relevant instances retrieved over total amount of relevant instances Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) The curve is plotted and area between the curve and the 45\u00b0 line is multiplied by 2 to give the AUROC. a value of 1 represents perfect accuracy while 0.5 means the prediction is worthless. we aim to improve the use of data for generating evidence on program reach and exposure as well as factors underpinning uptake for both programs. we will start by measuring dropped cases and missing data along the continuum of the databases. as part of this analysis, we aim to understand differentials in the characteristics of individuals lost along the continuum of databases. we then consider the technological performance as captured by four stakeholders. in south africa, over 80% of short messaging service (SMS) messages were successfully delivered as part of MomConnect. challenges in the use of unstructured supplementary service data meant 26% of initiated registrations did not convert into successful registrants. analysis will provide program implementers with tools for improving predictions of success and performance. deployments of similar programs may be able to apply some of the same approaches described. ifiers based on the above machine learning approaches will help identify gaps in data (Aim 1), target potential slow learners (Aim 2), measure exposure to program (Aim 3), characterize exposure levels in the population (Aim 4) and evaluate program impact (Aim 5). by using machine learning approaches, we aim to improve the use of data for generating evidence on program reach and exposure as well as factors underpinning uptake for both programs. analysis will help improve understanding of the quality of the RCH and MCTS data. predictors identified will help identify groups of women who are more likely to be missed by the program. findings will also be used to inform the sampling of respondents for qualitative research. mobile academy will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to generate predictors of training course completion by ASHAs based on performance on early modules of the course. these will be externally validated using a range of data elements on other ASHA characteristics obtained from the broader evaluation. findings will provide program implementers with tools for improving predictions of success and performance. the potential benefits of having other family members listen to information content could be immense. the absence of a complete set of predictors will be present due to the limitations of such large-scale data gathering processes. the two digital health examples described represent two of the largest digital health programs currently being implemented globally."}
