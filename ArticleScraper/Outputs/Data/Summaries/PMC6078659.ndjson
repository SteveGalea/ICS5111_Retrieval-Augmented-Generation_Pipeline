{"summary": "young adults with ARIs experience a negative impact on their work. ARIs are responsible for decreased job performance, loss of work-time, and hospitalization. increasing ARI incidence may help improve training accomplishments and trainees\u2019 health. a total of 1291 new recruits began basic military training for 4 weeks. a temporary medical office was built near the field training ground. there was no limit in the use of medical services during field training. ARI was defined as the recent onset of respiratory symptoms. a quasi-interventional study was conducted at a Korean army training center in Nonsan-si, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea from January 2009 to February 2009. a total of 1500 new recruits randomly distributed into 2 battalions. after 209 individuals returned home because of personnel and health problems, 1291 new recruits began basic military training for 4 weeks. ARI was defined as the recent onset of respiratory symptoms with or without elevation in body temperature. ARI was defined as the recent onset of respiratory symptoms with or without elevation in body temperature and at least one of the following: rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, or sputum. ARI was defined as the recent onset of respiratory symptoms with or without elevation in body temperature. al group performed a test for 2 proportions and calculated 95% confidence intervals. effect sizes near 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are regarded as a small, medium, and large. results 3.1. interviews with the battle commanders revealed no differences in training schedules, living environments, or indoor hand washing methods. squad commander, every trainee in each squad washed their hands in a line one after the other. hand washing was generally performed 3 times during field training. the overall cumulative incidence rate of ARI during those 4 weeks was significantly lower in the early hand washing group. interviews with battle commanders revealed that there were no differences in training schedules, living environments, or indoor hand washing methods. the hand washing method and cough etiquette were instructed to all trainees as a common curriculum. but there was a significant difference in terms of hand washing during outdoor activities. the overall cumulative incidence rate of ARI during those 4 weeks was significantly lower in the early hand washing group. the effect size was from small to medium, taking a value of 0.35. the effect size was from small to medium, taking a value of 0.35. hand washing is one of the most important methods to prevent infection. the transmission of infection can easily occur in basic training centers due to the close contact of trainees in group life. the probability of transmission of viruses will be higher during training. more convenient methods such as alcohol-based hand cleansing have been adopted and have shown their effectiveness in many clinical settings. future studies are needed to demonstrate whether other methods such as alcohol-based hand cleansing further decrease ARI incidence at military training facilities."}
