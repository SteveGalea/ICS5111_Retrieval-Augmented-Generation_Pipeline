{"summary": "new pathophysiological model describes the development of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) as the combined result of prenatal inflammation and hypoxic\u2013ischemic insult. neuroinflammation and a systemic inflammatory response are also important features of NAIS. all neonates were admitted with the initial diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. plasma levels of IL-4, IL-12, and IL-17 decreased in NAIS. CD8 lymphocytes appear to shift towards the pro-inflammatory direction in NAIS."}
