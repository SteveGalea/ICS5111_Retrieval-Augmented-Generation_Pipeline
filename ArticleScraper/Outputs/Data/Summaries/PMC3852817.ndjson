{"summary": "Background Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) represents a chronic progressive interstitial nephritis in striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract. the disease has endemic distribution in several Balkan countries. the disease shows familial clustering with affected individuals in several subsequent generations. the disease has a striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract. the tumours show varying degrees of malignancy. a multifactorial model with polygenic genetic predisposition explains the disease characteristics. there is no substantial evidence supporting viral etiopathogenesis of BEN. previous studies have implicated genes located in cytoband 3q25 - 3q26. methylation occurs mainly in regions with a high content of CpG sites. more than 50% of human genes contain a CpG island in promoter regions. methylation in promoter regions is associated with gene silencing and lower gene expression levels. differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in different patient-control pairs. after compiling the DMRs data from all pairs the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN. DNA was extracted by standard phenol-chloroform extraction procedure. stored at 80\u00b0C. 19 female samples and 30 male samples of Serbian ancestry were enrolled. methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDiP) was used to extract the methylated fraction from whole genome DNA. methylated and reference samples were subjected to further DNA extraction. methylated DNA sample was labelled with Cy5 (Cyanine5-red channel) concentration and dye incorporation were measured using Agilent Genomic DNA enzymatic labelling kit. over 5 g was considered satisfactory if Cy3 incorporation was between 18-25 pmol/g and Cy5 incorporation 7-20 pmol/g. pool sample concentration was measured by spectrophotometric assay on nanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific inc.) for all samples standard A260/280 and A260/230 data was recorded. only samples with A260/280 > 1.8 and A260/230 >1.8 were further processed. female controls 75 48,6 8 - 0 MeDIP and array analysis 200 l of the fragmented DNA pool sample were subjected to methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDiP) for immunoprecipitation we used Dynabeads\u00ae Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogentm) and Anti-5-Methylcytidine Monoclonal Antibody (Eurogentec) results were generated in Excel table. we designed software to scan through preliminary data to assess the methylation status of all 27 000 CpG islands. a second analysis was performed to reveal the common differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between several patient-control pairs grouped by: 1. endemic region and 2. gender: DMRs in BG-F/SER-F; DMRs in BG-M/SER-M and DMRs in BG-F/BG-M and SER-M/SER-F. the third level of analysis was performed by comparing DMRs in all subsets of patient-control pairs small changes in small subsets of patients can contribute to the disease. but since we are looking for more prominent alterations we can classify that as a small drawback. Table 2. Common DMRs in different patient-control pairs based on endemic region and gender Subsets of patient-control pairs Number of common DMRs % of common DMRs of all C. pG islands % of commonDMRs of defined DMRs in respective group Serbian pairs array data (females and males) 313 0.011 33.1/33.1 Bulgarian pairs array data (females and males) 65 0.002 22.2/ 6.9 Both male pairs array data (Bulgarian, Serbian) 45 0.001 15.4/ 4.8 In this comparison male patients have a greater percentage of shared common DMRs - 15.4% and 4.8% respectively in thissis 8.8% (SER) and 7.41% (BG); immune response 6.4% (SER) and 14.8% (BG) and transcriptional regulation 8% (SER) and 14.8% (BG). mRNA processing and DNA replication, signal transduction systems and miRNAs seem to be affected to a lesser extent. we estimated the number of DMRs in Bulgarian female patients to be 293 (Additional file 1: Table S1), in Bulgarian male patients \u2013 948 (Additional file 2: Table S2), Serbian female patients \u2013 947 (Additional file 3: Table S3), and Serbian male patients \u2013 944 (Additional file 4: Table S4) in Serbian endemic regions there is not a significant predominance of affected females. in Bulgarian endemic regions there is a major predominance of affected females. in bulgaria there is a major predominance of affected females. the functional significance of all genes was ascertained based on several online databases. for every gene the primary and secondary biological functions were determined. all genes were classified in 10 relatively broad groups. all genes are hypomethylated in BEN patients and methylated in healthy controls. the study aims to investigate methylation alterations throughout the whole genome of BEN patients. methylation status analysis represents a relatively new direction of genetic analysis. genes involved in innate immune response, inflammation and antiviral immunity seem to be involved in BEN. this is in accordance with the hypothesis of an abnormal immune response to viral and other external stimuli. HDAC11 is suggested to exist in a protein complex different from the known co-repressor complexes. inhibition of HDAC11 transcripts is proved to stimulate the production of tumour necrosis- (TNF-) and IL-17 in the supernatants of HL ( Hodgkin lymphoma) cells. this suggests invlovement of HDAC11 in immune response modulation. IL-17RA dysregualtion is implicated in major immune-mediated inflammatory disease such as Chron\u2019s disease [33] and psoriatic arthritis [34]. the CpG island in the promotor area of the gene SEC61G is hypomethylated in all four patient groups. the Sec61 complex encodes the gamma-subunit of the complex.
