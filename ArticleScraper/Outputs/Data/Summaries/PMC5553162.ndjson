{"summary": "a process of disease emergence is predicted to occur with increased frequency as humans continually change their interactions with the animal world. the currently known coronaviruses are classified into 30 species within four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. all known alphacoronaviruses form a monophyletic group within the subfamily Coronavirinae (13) the genus Alphacoronavirus includes 11 species (http://ictv.global/report) and some tentative species (13, 18\u201320) these virus species have been sampled from bats, as well as other mammals, including humans. the shrew family is the fourth largest among mammals. insects make up a large portion of the typical shrew diet. recent studies have revealed a remarkable diversity of viruses in invertebrates. -bp fragment of the viral RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene was performed to detect CoV RNA. the detection rate was 8.7% (2/23) in Ruian, 12.4% (12/97) in Wencheng, 10% (4/40) in Yudu, and 50% (6/12) in Xingguo. however, no CoV was detected in 94 Asian house shrews from Longwan. the key features of these genome sequences are described in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2. genetic analysis revealed that the nucleotide similarities among these viruses were 88.2 to 99.9%. they shared 48.7 to 55.1% nucleotide similarity with known alphacoronaviruses and less than 57.1% nucleotide similarity with others. nch\u00e9ng-578 26,028 nt F 2014 Wencheng Run-90 26,042 nt F 2014 Ruian Yd-76 26,002 nt M 2014 Yudu Xnggu\u00f3-101b 25,995 nt M 2015 Xingguo Xnggu\u00f3-74b 25,984 bp M 2015 Xingguo a M, male; F, female. b Strain with nearly complete genome sequence TRSa W\u00e9n AACUAA(1) AUG NS3 22652\u201323365 714 237 E 23346\u201323573 228 75 23321\u201323326 CUAAAC(19)AUG M 23586\u201324275 690 229 23577\u201323582 CUAAAC(3)AUG N 24279\u201325379 1,101 366 24272\u201324277 CUAAAC(1)AUG NS7 25366\u201325773 408 135 Yd- ORF1ab-spike (S)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032. a putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif (5\u2032-AACUAA-3\u2032) was discovered preceding the S gene in the shrew CoV genomes.

WESV formed a distinct cluster that was separated from other alphacoronaviruses by a relatively long branch. the strains clearly clustered according to their geographic origins, indicative of the in situ evolution of WESVs in shrews. however, the Ruian and Wencheng strains were both sampled in Wenzhou.

WESV showed 71.1% amino acid similarity to any known members of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the coronavirus-wide conserved domains. WESVs harbored by shrews were phylogenetically distinct within the genus Alphacoronavirus, suggesting that they may have emerged early in Asian house shrews. however, the evolutionary relationships among viruses sampled from four counties were not consistent with their geographic locations. the fact that the S gene of WESV was divergent from those of all known coronaviruses suggests an intergenus recombination event may have occurred. alphacoronaviruses have a far more complex evolutionary history than previously realized, with insectivores likely playing a more important role. shrews, classified in order Eulipotyphla, have a broad geographic distribution and exhibit substantial diversity. unlike bats and rodents, these mammals have not attracted attention with respect to virus evolution, emergence, and transmission. shrew coronaviruses were amplified using primers based on conserved regions of known genome sequences (18, 19) the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genomes were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) RT-PCR amplicons of 700 bp were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) purified DNA of >700 bp was cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and then transformed into JM109-143 competent cells. analysis of protein families was performed using the PFAM and InterProScan programs. the best-fit amino acid substitution models were determined using MEGA version 5 (48) the full genome alignment of all WESV sequences was screened for recombination. only sequences with significant evidence (P 0.05) of recombination detected by at least two methods were taken to represent strong evidence. total RNA was extracted from fecal samples using TRIzol reagent. RNA was eluted in 50 l of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water. bp were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. purified DNA of >700 bp was cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and transformed into JM109-143 competent cells. analysis of protein families was performed using the PFAM and InterProScan programs. the full genome alignment of all WESV sequences was screened for recombination using the RDP, GENECONV, and BootScan methods available within RDP4 (33). only sequences with significant evidence (P 0.05) of recombination detected by at least two methods were taken to represent strong evidence for recombination."}
