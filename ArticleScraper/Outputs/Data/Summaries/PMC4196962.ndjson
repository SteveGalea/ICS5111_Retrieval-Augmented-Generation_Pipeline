{"summary": "the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a tight seal composed of capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and perivascular astrocytes. the BBB contributes to homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) by limiting the entry of plasma components, erythrocytes, and immune cells from the circulating blood [2]. a recent study revealed that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) released from astrocytes promotes BBB formation and IL-1 suppressed SHH expression in endothelial cells and increased BBB permeability by downregulating TJ proteins in endothelial cells. IL-1 stimulated astrocytes to secrete pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL20, and CXCL2 which induce the migration of immune cells. inant IL-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 24 h, and then astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) were collected and used for subsequent experiments. the mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line, MBEC4 (a kind gift from Dr. T. Tsuruo) [21] was maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. assay buffer containing 4% FITC-BSA was loaded on the luminal side of the insert and incubated for 1 h. the concentration of FITC-BSA in the abluminal chamber was determined by measuring the fluorescence. assays were carried out in five independent trials. me-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out in five independent trials. western blotting MBEC4 cells were incubated with ACM, 2 ng/ml IL-1, 100 ng/ml SHH, 1 M purmorphamine, or 30 M cyclopamine for 24 h. rabbit anti-occludin polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), rabbit anti\u2013ZO-1 polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), or mouse anti\u2013actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich) the signals were visualized using a CS Analyzer 3.0 system. the cells were incubated for 24 h with or without 2 ng/ml mouse recombinant IL-1 (R&D systems), and then astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) were collected and used for subsequent experiments. the mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line, MBEC4 was maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium. assay buffer containing 4% FITC-BSA was loaded on the luminal side of the insert and incubated for 1 h. the concentration of FITC-BSA in the abluminal chamber was determined by measuring the fluorescence (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 530 nm) assays were carried out in five independent trials. western blotting MBEC4 cells were incubated with ACM, 2 ng/ml IL-1, 100 ng/ml SHH, 1 M purmorphamine, or 30 M cyclopamine for 24 h. incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti\u2013claudin-5 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), rabbit anti\u2013occludin polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), rabbit anti\u2013actin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), or mouse anti\u2013actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. FITC-BSA was loaded onto the luminal side of the insert for 1 h. then the FITC-BSA levels on the abluminal side were analyzed. IL-1 decreased astrocytic production of SHH Next, we focused on SHH. cyclopamine abolished the astrocytic effect on the maintenance of BBB function. expression levels of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 were closely correlated with BBB integrity. claudin-5 (A), occludin (B) and ZO-1 (C) were highest when permeability was lowest. IL-1 stimulated pro-inflammatory chemokines production in astrocytes. treatment with IL-1 significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of CXCL2, CCL2 and CCL20 in astrocytes. IL-1 also activates astrocytes to release these pro-inflammatory chemokines. treatment with IL-1 alone significantly increased the permeability of BBB. conditioned media from IL-1\u2013stimulated astrocytes lost ability to increase BBB integrity. IL-1 abolishes protective effect of astrocytes on BBB integrity. SHH produced by astrocytes plays a critical role in BBB integrity by upregulating expression of TJ proteins. claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 were closely correlated with BBB integrity. all quantitative data are expressed as means SEM (n = 5), normalized to the corresponding values from untreated cells. Western blotting of claudin-5 (A), occludin (B) and ZO-1 (C) in MBEC4 cells. IL-1 binds to its receptor, IL-1R, whose downstream signaling activates nuclear factor-B (NF-B), a key player in the immune and inflammatory response in astrocytes [27], [28]. NF-B promotes transcription of mediators of inflammation, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. a decrease in SHH allows Ptch-1 to suppress Smo\u2013Gli-1 signaling. it suppresses SHH production in astrocytes, downregulates TJ proteins in endothelial cells, and disrupts BBB integrity. il-1\u2013stimulated astrocytes secrete the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL2, CCL2 and CCL20. IL-1 suppresses astrocytic SHH production, leading to downregulation of tight junction proteins in endothelial cells and disintegrity of the BBB. IL-1 also activates astrocytes to release pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL2, CCL2 and CCL20. this leads to migration of immune cells, worsening BBB disruption and neuroinflammation. a previous study indicated that simple blockade of IL-1 runs the risk of increasing BBB disruption, because this cytokine also enhances the protective effects of astrocytes on the BBB. treatment with SHH may circumvent this dilemma, allowing reinforcement of BBB integrity without loss of the beneficial effects of IL-1."}
