RNA (3 g) was reverse-transcribed with 50 U MMLV reverse transcriptase. the reaction mix contained 4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M sense and antisense primer, 1 FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 mix and 2 l cDNA. cDNA was replaced by PCR-grade water as a negative control. incubation for 1, 2, 3 and 5 h with 1 g ml1 actinomycin D in serum-free medium. expression of fragments derived from activity of the myeloid (MP) or both the myeloid and epithelial (MP/EP) promoters of CD13 was determined by RT\u2013PCR. 0.5 g ml1 leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM PMSF (Merck, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), 0.1 mM sodium ortho vanadate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mM sodium fluoride (Baker Chemicals, Deventer, the Netherlands) were centrifuged for 15 min at 13 000 r.p.m. at 4\u00b0C to remove debris. membraneanes were washed and proteins visualized by electro-chemiluminescence. 1 105 cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 1 : 20 diluted phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse IgG1 or PBS. g ml1 CD13-neutralising mouse monoclonal antibody WM15 was monitored every 5 min during 1 h in a Spectrafluor multiplate reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria) the neutral aminopeptidase activity was calculated from the slope of the fluorescence\u2013time curve, using a calibration curve of 7-AMC. the matrigel invasion assay was performed in a 24-well plate transwell system. DMEM containing 10% FCS was added to the lower compartment. in control wells, 0.5% FCS was added to both the lower and the lower compartment. pGL2 basic-luciferase and pRenilla luciferase-CMV were purchased from Promega (Leiden, the Netherlands) pRL-CMV (pRL-CMV) was performed to correct for possible differences in transfection efficiency. CD13 promoter activity was increased in 1F6 cells overexpressing 18kD or ALL isoforms of bFGF mRNA and protein expression in 1F6-pcDNA3 cells. the overexpressed bFGF was biologically active in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation assay. increased CD13 mRNA expression up to 150-fold was observed in 1F6-18kD as well as in 1F6-ALL clones as well as in 1F6-ALL clones compared to the expression level in 1F6-pcDNA3. a similar pattern of CD13 upregulation was observed, although the absolute fold increase over 1F6-pcDNA3 CD13 expression levels varied with the reference gene of choice. the bFGF/hMG ratio in 1F6-pcDNA3 cells was set at 1. (B) basic fibroblast growth factor proteins from the same cell lines were visualised by subjecting 20 g protein per lane to Western blot. CD13 protein expression was determined by subjecting 50 g protein of each cell line to Western blot. bestatin, a nonspecific aminopeptidase inhibitor, resulted in a more than 90% inhibition of enzyme activity in all cell lines. the specific CD13-neutralising antibody WM15 (10 g ml1) did not inhibit the enzymatic activity in 1F6 and 1F6-pcDNA3 cells. 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones even invaded through matrigel 20 g filter1. addition of 350 M bestatin resulted in complete inhibition of the FCS-induced invasion. exposure to 10 g ml1 of the CD13-neutralising antibody WM15 also resulted in a significant reduction of invasion. clones 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL were set at 100%. migratory capacity of 1F6 cells was determined by a wound assay. exposure to 10 g ml1 WM15 did not inhibit the migration rate. CD13 mRNA in 1F6-pcDNA3 and bFGF-transfected 1F6 clones was degraded with similar half-lifes of approximately 18 h. cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D for different time periods. primer set was used to amplify fragments resulting from activity of both the epithelial and myeloid promoter. RT\u2013PCR analysis showed that at least the CD13 myeloid promoter is involved in the increased CD13 expression observed in 1F6 clones. cotransfections were performed with pRenilla-CMV. CD13 myeloid promoter activity in clones 1F6-18kD-H and 1F6-ALL-H was, respectively, 4.5- and 2.8-fold induced. activity of the epithelial promoter was also induced up to 2.5-fold in both bFGF-overexpressing clones. the two cell lines, BRO and BLM, with high bFGF expression also contained a high level of CD13 mRNA. low CD13 mRNA content was present in Mel57, M14 and 1F6 cells expressing low levels of bFGF mRNA. cDNAs were analysed for bFGF and CD13 mRNA expression in a panel of human melanoma cells. changes in cell morphology were observed in 1F6 cells overexpressing both the 18kD and ALL bFGF isoforms. accelerated in vitro and in vivo growth rates up to, respectively, two- and three-fold were observed in 1F6 cells. increased CD13 expression up to 150-fold was observed in 1F6-18kD as well as in 1F6-ALL clones as well as in 1F6-ALL clones. high expression of CD13 in bFGF-transfected 1F6 clones was confirmed on the protein level by Western blot. fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also confirmed high CD13 protein expression. CD13 expression in 1F6 clones was up to two-fold higher than that in the BRO cell line. CD13 protein expression was determined by subjecting 50 g protein of each cell line to Western blot. cells were incubated at room temperature with 1 : 20 diluted anti-human CD13 monoclonal antibody L-138 or control mouse IgG1 for 30 min. new aminopeptidase activity was determined in absence or presence of 350 M bestatin or 10 g ml1 WM15 from the slope of the fluorescence\u2013time curve. high CD13 expression in bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones facilitates invasion, but not migration CD13 has been implicated to be required for melanoma cell invasion. atin and WM15 were determined by an MTT assay. bestatin at 350 M resulted in a growth inhibition of approximately 10%. WM15 at 10 g ml1 did not affect cell growth. 1F6, 1F6-pcDNA3 and 1F6 clones highly overexpressing 18kD or ALL bFGF isoform proteins. migration of cells in wounds at time points t=5 h and t=12 h was expressed as a percentage of the width of the wound at t=0. fibroblast growth factor-induced CD13 expression is not due to increased mRNA stability. the CD13/2-microglobulin mRNA ratio was determined by light cycler RT-PCR. cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D for the time periods specified. basic fibroblast growth factor can induce expression of CD13 transcripts from the myeloid promoter. increased CD13 expression is mediated by enhanced activity of both the myeloid and epithelial promoter. transfections were performed using reporter gene constructs encoding for either the myeloid promoter (BstXI-luc) or the epithelial promoter (CD13-1.15-luc) CD13 myeloid and epithelial promoter activity in 1F6, 1F6-pcDNA3 and 1F6 clones highly overexpressing 18kD or ALL bFGF isoform proteins. bFGF overexpression can induce CD13 expression in human melanoma cells. cDNAs were analysed for bFGF and CD13 mRNA expression. cDNAs were plotted as mean expression ratios between bFGF, CD13 and human 2-microglobulin. of each cell line, 20 g (bFGF) or 50 g (CD13) protein was subjected to Western blot. the 18kD bFGF isoform functions as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor. it is found in the cytoplasm of cells and bound to heparan sulphate proteoglycans. the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms are located in the nucleus and are thought to play a role in transcriptional regulation. the authors have also reported that exogenous bFGF could induce CD13 expression in KS1767 Kaposi sarcoma cells. recently, Kehlen et al (2003) have shown induction of CD13 expression upon stimulation of serum-starved 1736 thyroid carcinoma cells with bFGF. this finding indicates that the bFGF-mediated induction of CD13 in 1F6 cells is an indirect effect of the transformation process in itself, rather than a direct effect on CD13 promote the activity of the myeloid and epithelial promoters of CD13 is believed to be mutually exclusive. expression of CD13 protein in a particular cell type is thought to be mediated by activation of either the myeloid or the epithelial promoter. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT (PI-3K/AKT) pathways in activated endothelial cells have shown that CD13 transcription was induced by RAS/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor Ets-2. phospho-AKT and p38 MAPK levels were increased as compared to basal levels in parent 1F6 cells. hypothesized that the presence of CD13 in melanoma patients will also be associated with poor prognosis. inhibition of CD13 aminopeptidase activity can reduce the invasive capacity of WM1158 and A375M melanoma cells through Matrigel. the observations are in agreement with our data that 1F6 cells could hardly invade through Matrigel. bestatin was given for its aminopeptidase inhibiting, immunostimulant and antitumour activity to patients with completely resected stage I squamous-cell lung carcinoma. of the 402 patients that entered the study, it appeared that overall survival and cancer-free survival were significantly different in favour of the bestatin-treated group."}
