{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) system is an integral part of innate immunity (1, 2). sensors of the IFN system recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and induce signaling cascades which induce the production and release of IFN. tetherin's antiviral activity was identified in the context of HIV-1 infection. influenza viruses cause annual epidemics (seasonal FLUAV) and intermittent pandemics (pandemic FLUAV) which are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality (15). the role of tetherin in FLUAV infection has not been well defined. initial studies indicated that FLUAV is only inefficiently inhibited by tetherin or is completely tetherin insensitive (17\u201319) HEK 293T cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.

Western blot images were analyzed with ImageJ software to quantify tetherin expression. RESULTS Tetherin inhibits release of neuraminidase-based virus-like particles. the glycoproteins of several viruses were identified as tetherin antagonists (24\u201329) release of both 1918 NA- and WSN NA-based VLPs was markedly reduced upon tetherin expression. this effect was rescued upon coexpression of HIV-1 Vpu. the results indicate that release of 1918 NA- and WSN NA-based VLPs is readily detectable. the hemagglutinin of the pandemic 1918 influenza virus antagonizes tetherin. we then analyzed whether the 1918 HA and WSN HA proteins can rescue VLP release driven by their cognate NAs from inhibition by tetherin. the tetherin-mediated release inhibition of 1918 NA-based VLPs was rescued by expression of both Vpu and 1918 HA. the results were confirmed in at least five (A) and three (B) separate experiments. the signal intensities measured for panels A and B were quantified using ImageJ software. tetherin-transfected 293T cells, removed input virus by washing. release of the laboratory-adapted virus was markedly inhibited by tetherin. inhibition efficiency correlated with the amount of tetherin expression. similar effects were not observed for the pandemic virus. sensitivity to inhibition by tetherin is strain dependent. 293T cells transfected with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plasmids were transfected. the cells were infected with A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) or A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1). at 1 h postinfection, the input viruses were removed by washing. at 24 h postinfection, the supernatants were harvested and titers determined using the focus formation assay. the results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown and were confirmed in a separate experiment. wt PR8 and reassortant PR8 viruses equipped with HA and NA of 2009 (PR8 2009 HA/NA) (D) or A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) confer tetherin resistance to pandemic viruses. the HA and NA proteins from several pandemic FLUAV can protect these viruses from inhibition by tetherin, at least in transfected 293T cells. the knockdown of tetherin expression markedly augmented release of A/PR/8/1934 but not A/Hamburg/4/2009. the knockdown of tetherin expression markedly augmented release of A/PR/8/1934 but not A/Hamburg/4/2009. a reassortant PR8 virus equipped with HA and NA of 2009 (PR8 2009 HA/NA) or A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (PR8 1968 HA/NA) at an MOI of 0.1 (PR8, PR8 2009 HA/NA, and PR8 1968 HA/NA) or 0.3 (2009). the average from three independent experiments performed with triplicates samples is shown. 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 Gag. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Vpu, 1918 HA, or 1918 NA or encoding no protein (control) similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments. several tetherin antagonists reduce tetherin expression levels in infected cells. tetherin expression was not reduced upon infection with A/PR/8/1934. a modest but statistically significant decrease in tetherin levels was observed in a/Hamburg/4/2009-infected cells. tetherin and -actin levels in mock-infected cells were set as 100%. tetherin inhibits release of neuraminidase-based virus-like particles. tetherin inhibits release of neuraminidase-based FLUAV-like particles. tetherin inhibits release of neuraminidase-based FLUAV-like particles. tetherin inhibits release of neuraminidase-based particles. the results of a representative experiment are shown and were confirmed in six separate experiments. the signal intensities measured for panel B were quantified using ImageJ software. the signal intensities measured for panel B were normalized to NA in cell lysates. hemagglutinin of pandemic 1918 influenza virus antagonizes tetherin. 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding 1918 NA (A) or WSN NA (B) and empty plasmids encoding the indicated HA proteins or Vpu. at 40 h posttransfection, NA expression in cell lysates and supernatants was detected via Western blotting. in 293T cells increasing amounts of tetherin, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) then infected the cells with either pandemic FLUAV (A/Hamburg/4/2009 [H1N1]) or laboratory-adapted FLUAV (A/PR/8/1934 [H1N1]), followed by quantification of viral release via focus formation assay. notably, release of the laboratory- 293T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding tetherin or transfected with empty plasmid (control) were infected with laboratory-adapted FLUAV PR8 and A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (abbreviated WSN), seasonal FLUAV A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) (abbreviated PAN), or pandemic FLUAV 2009 at an MOI of 0.1 (PR8), cells were processed and viral titers determined as described for panel A. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. the reassortant virus PR8 2009 HA/NA was resistant against tetherin's antiviral activity. a reassortant virus expressing the HA and NA segments of pandemic A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) in the background of A/PR/8/1934 (PR8 1968 HA/NA) turned out to be resistant against inhibition by tetherin, at least in transfected 293T cells. tetherin signal is heterogeneous due to heterogeneity in tetherin glycosylation. cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA (control) or tetherin-specific siRNA. reassortant PR8 virus equipped with HA and NA of 2009. 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 Gag. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Vpu, 1918 HA, or 1918 NA. expression of tetherin and -actin in cell lysates was determined. similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments. bands with molecular masses expected for NP and M1 proteins are marked with black-filled (NP) and gray-filled (M1) triangles. tetherin antagonists reduce tetherin expression levels in infected cells. reassortant virus equipped with HA and NA of 2009 (PR8 2009 HA/NA) or A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (PR8 1968 HA/NA) at an MOI of 0.1 at 1 h postinfection, the virus-containing medium was replaced by fresh culture medium. cells were lysed and expression of tetherin and -actin in cell lysates determined by Western blotting. studies employing FLUAV VLP systems provided evidence that release of FLUAV-like particles can be restricted by tetherin (18, 23), although some viral NAs counteract tetherin with modest efficiency (20, 21, 23), potentially by altering tetherin glycosylation (21) both 1918 NA and WSN NA can drive VLP budding, although with differential efficiency. the analysis of reassortant viruses showed that the introduction of the HA and NA segments of a pandemic virus was sufficient to confer tetherin resistance to an otherwise susceptible virus. this finding is not in conflict with most previous studies documenting FLUAV inhibition by tetherin, which exclusively examined seasonal or laboratory-adapted FLUAV (17\u201319, 21) many viral tetherin antagonists remove tetherin from the site of viral budding, the plasma membrane. for instance, the HIV-1 Vpu protein degrades tetherin and additionally interferes with tetherin transport to the cell surface (6, 7, 12\u201314) the Ebola virus glycoprotein counteracts tetherin without interfering with tetherin expression or cellular localization. tetherin-resistant and -susceptible viruses differ in the amounts of HA and NA copies incorporated into viral particles. virion incorporation of HA and NA may contribute to tetherin inhibition. tetherin-resistant and -susceptible viruses differ in the amounts of HA and NA copies incorporated into viral particles. tetherin-antagonizing activity of HA/NA is FLUAV specific. intuitive but might be the result of adaptation of HA to immune pressure."}
