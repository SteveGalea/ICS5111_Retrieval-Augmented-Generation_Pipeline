{"summary": "enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infections in humans are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both developing and developed countries. over 100 serotypes of shiga toxin-producing E. coli have been associated with human infections. drug target identification is the first step in the drug discovery process. traditional drug discovery methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often yield few drug targets. advances in genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics represent an attractive alternative approach to identify drug targets worthy of experimental follow-up. we elucidated a good number of novel targets in E. coli O157:H7 to design effective drugs against broad-spectrum pathogenic bacteria. to the best of our knowledge this was the first in silico identification of drug targets in E. coli O157:H7. all human protein sequences were retrieved from Refseq database ftp site. only the non-hit proteins at e-value cut off 1010 were selected as non-homologous proteins to avoid any functional similarity with host proteome. the novel targets were subjected to BLASTP against these proteomes at e-value cut off 105, sequence identity >35%, bit score >100. the non-hit proteins at the threshold value were selected as novel drug targets. virtual screening was done with a total 6,460 molecules, 5,040 experimental and 1,447 approved molecules deposited into the dnaE. top 100 molecules were selected based on lowest binding energy. the bioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (version 7.1.3) was used to screen for and eliminate probable essential proteins of the organism setting e-value cut off 104, sequence identity >35%, bit score >100 and others as default. only the non-hit proteins at e-value cut off 1010, were selected as non-homologous proteins. druggability is another important prioritization criterion for therapeutic targets. druggability is defined as the likelihood of being able to modulate the activity of the therapeutic target protein with a small-molecule drug. modeled structure was assessed through SWISS-MODEL structure assessment tool44 and ANOLEA (atomic non-local environment assessment). energy minimization was carried out by GROMOS96 with default parameters implemented in Swiss PDB Viewer (version 4.0.4) a systematic workflow was defined involving several bioinformatics tools, databases, and drug target prioritization parameters. a total of 35 pathways were present only in the pathogen and termed as pathogen-specific pathways. the remaining 70 pathogen pathways were defined as common host-pathogen pathways as listed in Table 1.

Lowest docking energies, important residues of the binding site observed to be interactive with the ligands from DrugBank. a total of 35 pathways were present only in the pathogen and termed as pathogen-specific pathways. the remaining 70 pathogen pathways were defined as common host-pathogen pathways. a systematic workflow was defined involving several bioinformatics tools, databases, and drug target prioritization parameters. e and mannose metabolism ecs01040 Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids ecs00052 Galactose metabolism ecs02010 ABC transporters ecs00053 Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism ecs03010 Ribosome ecs00061 Fatty acid biosynthesis ecs03018 RNA degradation ecs00071 Fatty acid metabolism ecs03020 RNA polymerase s00340 Histidine metabolism ecs00600 Sphingolipid metabolism ecs00350 Tyrosine metabolism ecs00360 Pyruvate metabolism ecs00360 Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis ecs00650 Butanoate metabolism ecs00410 beta-Alanine metabolism ecs00670 One carbon pool by folate ecs00430 Taurine and hypot cs00642 Ethylbenzene degradation ecs00363 Bisphenol degradation ecs00660 C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism ecs00680 Methane metabolism ecs00401 Novobiocin biosynthesis ecs00903 Limonene and pinene degradation ecs00910 Nitrogen metabolism ecs00473 D-Alanine metabolism ecs00930 Caprolact unique pathways are those that are specific to the pathogen but absent in its host. proteins in these pathways can also be considered as unique to the pathogen and might serve as potential drug and vaccine targets. a single unique protein can also take part in multiple pathways. membrane localized proteins are difficult to purify and assay53. cytoplasmic proteins are more favorable as drug targets. most of the proteins had MW less than 100 kDa indicating the possibility to experimentally study these proteins for drug development. 80 proteins and 49 proteins were from common and unique pathways respectively. a list of approved drug and drug-like compounds was identified. ten proteins were identified as having experimentally determined 3D structures in PDB. Figure 3 shows the percentage distribution of novel drug targets involved in different biological processes. 44 proteins were uniquely involved in pathogen-specific 12 unique pathways. three enzymes of lipid A pathway were found uniquely present in peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. the protein ilvH, acetolactate synthase III small subunit, is a unique protein present in C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism (KEEG Pathway: map00660) the putative resistance protein was identified as unique protein present in phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism (KEGG Pathway: map00440) flagellum extending from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior serves as both a motor organelle and a protein export/assembly apparatus. 19 proteins were identified as unique in the pathogen-specific pathway in a two-component system. dnaE subunit and AckA were involved in a maximum number of pathways. dnaE catalyzes the reversible reaction of formation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and ATP. there is no resolved X-ray crystallography structure for both dnaE (E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand) and dnaE (E. coli O157:H7 Sakai BLAST searched for dnaE (Uniprot ID: Q8X8X5) with e-value cut off of 0.001 against UniprotKB. only the human hosts were considered and predicted to be pathogenic if involved in disease(s) according to PATRIC database. structure modeled with ESyPred3D server has residues in most favored regions 92.4%, residues in additional allowed regions 7.1%, and residues in generously allowed regions 0.3%. good quality model would be expected to have over 90% in most favored regions. the force-field energies of the overall structure before and after minimization were 13,816.546 KJ/mol and 36,224.391 KJ/mol respectively. the properties of the active site are determined by the sequences of amino acids and the 3D arrangement of the polypeptide chains of the enzyme. the active site residues with a volume of 17,116 were shown in Figure 6. Literature searching helped us to identify the important residues within the pocket. the 251D molecule is a potent inhibitor of the bacterial replicative dnaE. top 100 hits from DrugBank showing lower binding energies were filtered for Lipinski\u2019s rule of five85 that reduced the compounds to 59. human intestinal absorption was 95.36% and 88.10% for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively. plasma protein binding prediction results showed 99.28% and 100.00% plasma protein binding for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively. both drugs exhibit good oral bioavailability. two CID 9809878 SER365, ARG391, ARG711, PHE392, ASP402, ASP404, GLY364, MET400, ARG397, SER545, GLY56, VAL52, LYS30, LYS53, ALA57, TYR549 8.7 3 ZINC 28356629 SER365, PHE392, ARG391, ARG397, MET400, ASP402, ASP404 dnaE is a member of C family of polymerases87,88 that are unique in terms of sequence. it has been reported that DNA polymerase III inactivation would impede survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the host. ity of proteins, dissimilarity with host, conservation among pathogens, availability in drug databases, virtual screening etc, were used to explore potential drug targets. this in silico strategy can be used to design and develop new drugs against other emerging human pathogens."}
