{"summary": "from 2004 to 2010, 11 LAIs in total were reported to the u.s. CDC. from 2004 to 2010, on average 10,000 individuals per year had access to select agents in an average of 292 laboratories per year. from 2004 to 2010, on average 10,000 individuals per year had access to select agents in an average of 292 laboratories per year. these estimates do not take into account specific pathogen types or research settings. from 2004 to 2010 involved viruses (7). the risks of LAIs associated with work on viral pathogens should therefore be estimated as less than 1 per 2,044 (5 104 per laboratory-year), or less than 1 per 70,000 (1.4 105 per person-year)."}
