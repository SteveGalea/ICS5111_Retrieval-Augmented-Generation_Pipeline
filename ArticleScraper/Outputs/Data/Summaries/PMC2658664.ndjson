{"summary": "the human analog of yeast Pat1p is most likely the best drug target candidate. the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human hepatitis C virus (HCV) have worldwide infected around 40 and 170 million people. the fast developing omics-technologies in the last few years have witnessed a remarkable increase in our understanding of how complex cell systems are regulated at the level of their genes, transcripts and proteins. a setback is the increased side effects inherent to multi-drug intake. the present challenge is how to prioritize among the many virus dependency factors experimentally determined. we have shown that the proteins Pat1p, Lsm1p-7p and Dhh1p are required for the replication of human viruses in yeast. the levels of metabolites differed clearly between the reference strain and the deletion strains pat1, lsm1 and dhh1. the specific growth rate of pat1, 0.22 h-1 was quite similar to that of the reference strain, 0.28 h-1, whereas dhh1, 0.16 h-1, and lsm1, 0.15 h-1, grew clearly slower. specific glycerol production rate of 0.10 0.02 g g-1 CDW h-1 was lower than for the deletion strains pat1 and dhh1. the specific ethanol production rate of the lsm1 mutant was lowest, 0.60 0.03 g g-1 CDW h-1. most of the identified metabolites were in the low abundance region of the chromatogram. most of the high abundance peaks are substances derived from column bleeding or the derivatization reagent. a good correlation was found between normalized peak areas and intracellular amino acid concentrations. phenylalanine, aspartic acid and glycine were identified in the cell extracts. 3 glycerol-1-phosphate 29 370 4 glutamine 30 156 3 N-acetyl-glutamic acid 31 216 2 u.m. #TMS denotes tert-methyl-silyl residues in the detected analyte originating from derivatization, MeOx denotes methoxymation of the metabolite.

concentrations in both strains. the numerical labels of the single metabolites are defined in Table 2. the distances between the four strains correspond to the Euclidian distance calculated by using the normalized areas of the extracted metabolites of the four strains. the four strains form distinct clusters using two parallel cultures and three sampling times each. analysis was conducted using SIMCA-P+ 11.5 (Umetrics, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) data were pareto scaled and the first two components were autofitted. all metabolites whose confidence intervals do not include zero were assumed statistically significant. the highest concentration was found in the lsm1 strain (200 times the concentration in the reference strain) the intracellular pools of the two strains pat1 and dhh1 were approximately 25 times higher compared to the reference strain pool size of intracellular trehalose. ic wild type strain S. cerevisiae ATCC 32167 revealed intracellular concentrations of leucine, histidine and lysine were always higher than in the non-auxotrophic wild type strain. the concentration of leucine, histidine and lysine of strain BY4742 were 13.1, 39.2 and 93.9 mol/g CDW. specific glycerol production rates were similar for reference strain and deletion strains pat1 and dhh1 with 0.22 0.03 g g-1 CDW h-1, 0.15 0.03 g g-1 CDW h-1 and 0.18 0.02 g-1 CDW h-1. the specific ethanol production rate of the lsm1 mutant was lowest, 0.60 0.03 g g-1 CDW h-1. most of the identified metabolites were in the low abundance region of the chromatogram. most of the high abundance peaks are substances derived from column bleeding or the derivatization reagent. metabolites identified in the cell extracts of BY4742 and the used deletion mutants using the software AMDIS v2.0 and a TMS

4.81E-05 9.72E-06 4.23E-05 mol/g CDW and normalized peak areas for amino acids (A) aspartic acid, (B) glycine and (C) phenylalanine were determined by GC/MS. the three deletion strains pat1, dhh1 and lsm1 and the reference strain BY4742 were compared using relative pool sizes of intracellular metabolites. the deletion of the genes DHH1 and LSM1 caused larger deviations. this is in accordance with the specific growth rates of the four strains describing the overall fitness of the cells. analysis was conducted using SIMCA-P+ 11.5 (Umetrics, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) data were pareto scaled and the first two components were autofitted. all metabolites whose confidence intervals do not include zero were assumed statistically significant. the most significant differences between the reference strain BY4742 and the three deletion strains was the accumulation of intracellular trehalose. the highest concentration was found in the lsm1 strain (200 times the concentration in the reference strain), while the intracellular pools of the two strains pat1 and dhh1 were approximately 25 times higher. intracellular amino acid concentrations were always higher in deletion strains. the only exception was arginine in the lsm1 deletion strain. we could identify 41 intracellular metabolites and 6 metabolites of unknown chemical structure in polar extracts of S. cerevisiae using GC/MS covering nearly all parts of central metabolism. the average variation of intracellular metabolites of the six independent samples of one single strain was around 20%. dhh1 differed from those of the reference strain S. cerevisiae BY4742. some of the metabolites found were usually not observed in human. others are essential amino acids that are not synthesized by human. S. cerevisiae deletion mutants with the parental phenotype BY4742 Mat his31 leu20 lys20 ura30 were obtained from open biosystems. derived yeast deletion mutants lsm1 pat1 and dhh1 exhibit auxothrophies for histidine, leucine, lysine and uracil. 100 trace element solution consists of FeCl36 H2O 75 mg/l, MnSO4H2O 53 mg/l, ZnSO47 H2O 45 mg/l and CuSO45 H2O 12 mg/l [12] the main culture was carried out in defined synthetic medium using 1000 ml baffled shake flasks. the same medium without additional amino acids and uracil was also used for the cultivation of S. cerevisiae ATCC 32167 that is glucose and ethanol concentrations in the supernatant were determined using enzymatic kits (Boehringer Mannheim, R-Biopharm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). intracellular amino acid concentrations were determined by HPLC using an OPA method. the remaining powder was derivatised using 25 l 20 g/l methoxylamine/HCl in pyridine for oximation (30 min, 80\u00b0C) followed by 50 l N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) for silylation. metabolites were scaled using a standard of 33 hydrocarbons ranging from C8 to C40. a relative quantification is sufficient to determine the differences between the reference and deletion strains. yeast extract and nutrient agar were obtained from Difco (Sparks, USA) Yeast extract and nutrient agar were obtained from Difco (Sparks, USA) 100 trace element solution consists of myo-inositol 301.5 mg/l, Ca-panthotenate 150 mg/l, thiamin/HCl 30 mg/l, pyridoxine/HCl 7,5 mg/l and biotin 0,15 mg/l. the main culture was carried out in defined synthetic medium using 1000 ml baffled shake flasks. ifugation (10 min, 8,000 g, 4\u00b0C, Biofuge stratos, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) was performed at 80\u00b0C until constant weight was observed. the linear correlation between CDW and OD660 is CDW [g/l] = 0.51 [g/l]OD660 nm. cell-debris was separated by centrifugation (10 min, 1,500 g, 4\u00b0C, Labofuge 400R, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) and extracted again with 750 l chloroform (37\u00b0C, 10 min) the polar phase was further analyzed. the sampling process until quenching was not oxygen limited. 1l of derivatised sample was injected splitless for 2 min using a PTV with a temperature gradient from 75\u00b0C to 340\u00b0C with a rate of 360\u00b0C/min. injector. temperature of ion source and transfer liner were 200\u00b0C and 240\u00b0C. comparing a deletion strain with the reference strain was carried out using SIMCA-P 11.5+ (Umetrics, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) for data visualization and selection of interesting metabolites loading plots, pareto scaling was used for all variables.
