{"summary": "the pathophysiology of diarrhea is complex, poorly understood and can involve a wide array of infectious and non-infectious etiologies [2], [3]. clinical evaluation of ill animals directs the selection of diagnostic procedures such as parasite studies, microbiological examinations and/or toxin testing. cost-benefit analysis often results in diarrhea in pets being managed by empirical therapy with antimicrobials and antimicrobials. study used the EMR's from a participating practice network and explored text mining for accessing and analyzing the textual orders for diagnostic testing and AMU in the medical records. a custom-built data extraction program was used to extract the anonymized electronic medical records (n = 428,783) from the veterinary practice management programs from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2010. texts were organized into categorization dictionaries to identify and retrieve cases. each of the 18,827 records represented a uniquely identified patient classified as having diarrhea, seen at a participating practice on a recorded date. for classification purposes a diagnostic test was a laboratory test that could either be performed in the practice by the animal health technologist or sent to an external veterinary laboratory. real time PCR tests were performed to screen fecal samples for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A, Cryptosporidium spp., Salmonella spp., feline coronavirus, feline 0.05, ii) a priori estimate of the proportion, conservatively = 0.5, iii) precision = 0.1. the calculated number of cases positive for each activity required in the sample was 96. the number of controls required was calculated using, Ncontrols = NCases. text miner's categorization dictionary for antimicrobial use was applied to all of the 15,928 diarrhea cases to classify cases that had been administered, dispensed or prescribed antimicrobials. co-occurrences of antimicrobial use were identified by the text miner and the antimicrobials used in combination were described. twelve of the 20 eligible practices agreed to participate in this project. a data sharing agreement was signed by each of the practice's managing partners and the author (Anholt) each of the 18,827 records represented a uniquely identified patient classified as having diarrhea, seen at a participating practice on a recorded date. after the initial visit, animals may have been hospitalized, returned for re-examination or telephone consultation with the owners for the same complaint. a case was classified as positive for etiologic diagnosis if a positive outcome for any of the diagnostic tests described above was recorded. positive classification included imprecise morphological diagnoses of bacterial infections such as bacterial overgrowth and Campylobacter-type spp. text miner and external standard cross-tabulated dichotomous results. results for each case definition were summarized as the sensitivity and specificity of the text miner's ability to correctly classify cases. the 95% confidence intervals for the sensitivity and specificity were also calculated. for each month of the study, we determined the proportion of cases treated with any antimicrobial and the proportions treated with each class of antimicrobial. the temporal trend for all antimicrobials combined and for each antimicrobial was examined by fitting a linear regression model to the data. text miner for classifying cases as positive or negative for \u2018had diagnostic testing\u2019 when compared to a manual review of the medical records serving as the external standard. from a random sample of 500 companion animal cases of diarrhea, the accuracy of the text miner for classifying the cases as positive or negative for \u2018had an etiological diagnosis made\u2019. text miner did not accurately classify cases that had laboratory testing performed or a diagnosis made. 88 cases (17.6%) in the sample of 500 diarrhea positive cases tested to identify an etiological diagnosis. etiological diagnosis made, and were administered, prescribed or dispensed antimicrobials. there were 8041 cases that were administered, dispensed or prescribed antimicrobials in most (87.1%) of the antimicrobial-treated diarrhea cases. nitroimidazole plus a penicillin was the most frequent treatment combination (n = 346) followed by nitroimidazole together with first and second generation cephalosporins (n = 79), penicillins with fluorquinolones (n = 67) and nitroimidazoles in combination with fluorquinolones (n = 66) the regression analyses of the remaining antimicrobials were not statistically significant. from 15,928 cases of companion animals with diarrhea, scattergrams of the counts of cases treated with 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins and penicillin -lactamase inhibitor combinations showed patterns of antimicrobial use. text miner misclassified cases if the name of the antimicrobial was not provided or improperly spelled, if the record contained information about past treatment or future considerations for treatment. text mining classified cases that had been treated with antimicrobial with high sensitivity (92.3%) and specificity (85%) when compared to a human reviewer. text miner did not accurately classify cases that had laboratory testing performed or a diagnosis made. 88 cases (17.6%) in the sample of 500 diarrhea positive cases tested to identify an etiological diagnosis. distribution of a sample of companion animal cases with diarrhea by the
