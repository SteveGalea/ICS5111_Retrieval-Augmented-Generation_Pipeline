{"summary": "at least seven separate viral outbreaks have caused tens of thousands of human deaths. the ever-increasing density of livestock, rate of habitat destruction, and extent of human global travel provides a fertile environment for new pandemics to emerge from host switching events. one study estimated that there are at least 320,000 virus species infecting mammals alone. characterization of unknown viral entities in the environment is now possible with modern sequencing. but current tooling for exploiting these data represents a practical and methodological bottleneck for effective data analysis. there is a need for robust and intuitive analytical tools without requirements for fast internet connectivity, which may be unavailable in remote or developing regions. study the landscape of available approaches for analyzing both known and unknown viruses within genomic and metagenomic samples. physical and insilico approaches are widely used prior to sequencing viral samples. size filtration or density-based enrichment by centrifugation are two effective methods for increasing virus yield. the current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. the short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes. long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive DNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads. assembly can be performed by either reference-based alignment or de novo assembly, a decision dependent on experimental objectives. assembly is widely used for generating whole genome consensus sequences to facilitate analyses of well-characterized viruses. older, notable, de novo assemblers implementing OLC include CAP3 (Huang and Madan 1999) and Celera (http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/cabog/overview/) there also exist a number of OLC assemblers intended for use with viral sequences: VICUNA was designed for short, non-repetitive and highly variable reads from a single population. taxonomic assignment Source Command line Linux, MAC OS GNU GPL Fast in-memory k-mer search and LCA taxonomic assignment. overlapping reads are bundled into aligned contigs in what is referred to as the layout step. the most likely nucleotide at position is determined through consensus. nucleotide and protein homology search Binary, source Web, command line Linux, Windows, Mac OS Public domain Nucleotide and protein homology search Binary, source Web, command line Linux, Windows, Mac OS Public domain Nucleotide and protein homology search Binary, source Web, command line Linux, Windows, Mac OS Public domain Nucleotide and protein homology search. taxonomic assignment Web application Web \u2013 \u2013 Annotation and visualization of viral reads and assemblies.

MHAP (Berlin et al. 2015), Canu (Berlin et al. 2015), and Miniasm (Li 2016) represent the current state of the art. taxonomic assignment Source Command line Linux, MAC OS GNU GPL Fast in-memory k-mer search and LCA taxonomic assignment. k-mer seeded protein search and LCA taxonomic assignment using a sequence database.

IDBA-UD partitions a de Bruijn graph into isolated components. nucleotide sequences must first be numerically transformed with one of several techniques including real number representations. sequences 1 and 2 are subsequences of the HIV-1 HXB2 genome. sequence 3 is a subsequence of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome. metagenome assemblers generally outperform single genome assemblers in reconstructing different genomes simultaneously. complexity of this task stipulates their tendency to collapse variation at or beneath strain level into consensus sequences. ShoRAH extracts local alignments of a specified window length, reconstructs haplotypes for each \u2018cluster\u2019 in that window, and removes mutations from sequences in the cluster not matching the reconstructed haplotype. the computational requirements of available approaches vary dramatically according to their ability to detect homology in divergent sequences. high-sensitivity protein alignment searches may be prohibitively slow, especially in application to entire sequencing datasets. retroactive taxonomic assignment using these results is non-trivial. logy search strategies include VirusHunter (Zhao et al. 2013), a Perl script that automates viral identification using BLAST prior to assembly. VirSorter (Roux et al. 2015), which identifies prophages and viruses by comparison with custom datasets. similarity search approaches are in general extremely resource-intensive, and performing sensitive BLAST-like database searches with millions of reads is intractable without specialist computational resources. relatively few validated viral sequences deposited in public databases. lack of a defined set of core genes common to all viruses that can be used to distinguish species. comparison methods that do not rely on sequence similarity include PhyloPythia. if up-to-date indexes are maintained inside a public repository, their file sizes are substantial, demanding users have access to a fast internet connection. complete outsourcing of sequence classification to remote web services is a compelling prospect for those with adequate internet connections. similarity search approaches are extremely resource-intensive, and performing sensitive BLAST-like database searches with millions of reads is intractable without specialist computational resources. one codex is a web-based metagenome analysis platform with an integrated fast k-mer matching engine. these features make it difficult to assign similarity thresholds for classification that are applicable to all potential viruses in a sample. comparison methods that do not rely on sequence similarity include PhyloPythia (McHardy et al. 2007), and PHYMM (Brady and Salzberg 2009), may be more robust to the limitations of the database. emergence of virus-specific assembly and metagenomic tools is a relatively recent phenomenon. many of the methodologies in use today repurposing one or more existing algorithms. democratisation of routine analyses through development of user friendly and user friendly channels is critical. the future of the field is promising, with emerging technologies showing potential to eliminate certain challenges. single molecule sequencing permits the sequencing of whole viral genomes as single reads, with forthcoming portable and smartphone operated sequencers promising potentially revolutionary analyses in the field. the future of the field is promising, with emerging technologies showing potential to eliminate certain challenges."}
