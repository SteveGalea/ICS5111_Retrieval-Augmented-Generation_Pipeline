{"summary": "adults aged 21 years admitted through the emergency department were recruited from 1 November through 30 May during 3 winters (2008\u20132011) patients were screened within 24 hours of hospitalization, excluding those given antibiotics prior to admission or with immunosuppression, cavitary lung disease, or witnessed aspiration. single blood cultures positive for organisms consistent with skin flora were considered contaminants. Sputum cultures were only considered positive if more than a rare pathogenic bacteria grew from an adequate sample. a 4-fold rise in titer was considered evidence of infection. plasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were performed using published methods [19\u201321]. human rhinovirus assays were performed on the basis of methods published by Lu et al. using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test, and categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test. the false-discovery rate was used to account for multiple comparisons. the study was approved by the university of Rochester and Rochester general Hospital institutional review boards. all subjects underwent testing for bacterial pathogens including blood culture, sputum culture and Gram stain, Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen and pneumococcal serologic testing, and PCR of sputum and nose swab specimens. Sputum cultures were only considered positive if more than a rare pathogenic bacteria grew from an adequate sample with exception of Legoinella. a 4-fold rise in titer was considered evidence of infection. influenza A virus (Matrix gene), influenza B virus (NS1 gene), human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 (polymerase gene) and parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (nucleocapsid gene) sequencing will be supplied on request. a 4-fold rise in the viral specific immunoglobulin G level was considered evidence of infection. human rhinovirus assays were performed using published methods [19\u201321]. a positive blood culture result, (2) a culture of an adequate sputum sample that was positive for a respiratory pathogen, (3) a urinary antigen test positive for S. pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila, (4) a serologic assay positive for pneumococci, (5) a PCR assay positive for S. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, or (6) a serum PCT level of 0.25 ng on admission or hospital day 2. mixed viral-bacterial categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test. the false-discovery rate was used to account for multiple comparisons. variables not included because of missing values included pneumococcal vaccination status, percentage of neutrophils or band forms in peripheral blood. a microbiologic diagnosis was made in 447 (53%) of 842 hospitalizations. 99 (12%) involved bacterial infection alone and 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. of those involving viral infection, 212 (61%) had viral infection alone. 64 (18%) had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection on the basis of specific bacterial testing. adenovirusa 1 0 0 1 (0.1) NA 0 0 0 Viral- bacterial coinfection 13 8 17 38 (5) 27 (71) 10 (26) 10 (26) 18 (47) Influenza A virus was the most common virus and accounted for 10% of hospitalizations. rate of pneumonia was lowest for human rhinovirus (in 10% of hospitalizations) and highest for human metapneumovirus (in 31%) and human coronavirus OC43 (in 30%). there were no significant differences in the rates of mixed viral-bacterial infection by viral pathogen. in 69% of hospitalizations with bacterial infection defined on the basis of PCT level alone, the negative results of sputum cultures were considered unreliable, compared with 51% for the group as a whole. hospitalizations associated with elevated PCT levels with or without positive results of bacterial tests involved patients who were similar with respect to age, rate of pneumonia, physical examination findings, and severity of illness score. median PCT values were higher for groups with positive bacterial test results compared to those with no positive bacterial test results. median PCT values were higher for groups with positive bacterial test results compared to those with no positive bacterial test results.
