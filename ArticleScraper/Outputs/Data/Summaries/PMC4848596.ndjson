{"summary": "host shutoff is thought to contribute to cellular takeover in two ways. host shutoff can free up machinery and thus redirect cellular resources towards viral gene expression. host shutoff mechanisms may interfere with anti-viral stress responses. host shutoff can block IFN responses and reduce expression of major histocompatibility molecules. many viruses have converge on similar molecular pathways to regulate host gene expression. this suggests some steps in gene expression may constitute particularly vulnerable points in gene regulation that can be exploited by pathogens. the -herpesvirus herpes simplex viruses (HSV), the -herpesviruses, and influenza A virus (IAV) use multiple viral factors to negatively regulate different stages of mRNA biogenesis and reduce host gene expression. host shutoff in herpesviruses is based on differences in cell tropism. multiple mechanisms to directly regulate host gene expression have been described in - and -herpesviruses. capacity to globally affect mRNA stability is a general feature of infection with several - and -herpesviruses. mRNA degradation triggered by viral ribonucleases (RNases) mutated vhs exhibit either attenuated or altered disease development in mice [21,22,23,24] due to increased host type I IFN responses. vhs is essential for virus-host interaction, rather than viral replication per se. in vitro studies of EBV BGLF5 and KSHV SOX have shown that these proteins have both DNase and RNase activity [28,29], although they bind DNA substrates with greater affinity than RNA [29] the same active site carries out both functions, as catalytically inactive mutants prevent both DNase activity in vitro and host shutoff upon SOX overexpression in cells [10,32,33] X-mediated host shutoff is not required for the acute phase of infection in the mouse lungs. a number of different processes may be at play, including a shift between the latent and the lytic cycle balance [34] and a cell-specific requirement for host shutoff in viral replication [37]. muSOX and its homologs may have a role in regulating host immune responses. vhs and SOX do not associate with Pol II-transcripts in the same manner. pol II transcripts are recognized by vhs because of its association with the cap-binding complex. vhs and SOX cut RNAs preferentially towards the 5\u2032 end. a vhs mutation abolishes direct interaction between vhs and eIF4H (but not eIF4F) abrogates vhs-mediated mRNA degradation in cells without affecting RNase activity in vitro. a separate mechanism of RNA targeting has been described for mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 UTR. KSHV SOX cuts RNAs in a sequence-specific manner [33,54]. this was first observed in reporter mRNAs because knockdown of cellular exonuclease uncovered presence of SOX degradation intermediates of defined and reproducible sizes. bioinformatics analysis identified a degenerate element that triggered SOX-mediated cuts when transplanted onto reporter RNAs. MHV68 muSOX appears to cut reporter mRNAs at the 5\u2032 end like vhs. mRNAs of DNA viruses are transcribed and processed by the same machinery as host mRNAs. in -herpesviruses, vhs actively degrades early viral transcripts, but it is then inactivated by other HSV proteins. the MHV68 HS virus appears to have evolved to adapt to host shutoff. the virions are altered when host shutoff is inactive and the virus is less competent to replicate in murine embryonic fibroblasts. the altered balance of viral protein production may underlie the cell-type specific replication defect and the trafficking defect of this mutant virus. the IL-6 mRNA is not degraded by SOX [67] because of its association with several cellular factors including the ARE-binding proteins HuR and AUF1 [70] and the multifunctional protein nucleolin [71]. Interestingly, the SOX-resistant element and nucleolin binding also protect RNAs against the action of other viral RNases like vhs. UL12.5 is not required for replication of the virus in tissue culture. it affects type I IFN responses that are triggered by mitochondrial stress during HSV-1 infection. mtDNA-depleting function of the AE is unique to HSV-1 and -2. KSHV SOX-mediated RNA degradation triggers relocalization of two isoforms of PABPC, PABPC1 and PABPC4. this region mediates interactions with the cellular adaptors importins. deletion of all four RRMs prevents nuclear relocalization in presence of SOX and in vitro association with importins. cellular poly(A) polymerase-dependent hyperadenylation of host transcripts and a nuclear mRNA export block. a reduction in mRNA export likely contributes towards repression of host protein production by preventing the cytoplasmic pool of mRNAs from being replenished after degradation. feedback inhibition of host gene transcription has also been reported as an additional secondary consequence of host shutoff. vhs is messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) composed of mRNAs. they are thought to provide a mechanism for the cell to store a pool of ready-to-go translationally inactive mRNAs during periods of stress. stress granules are not visible in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 and -2. infection of vhs-deficient HSV-1 or -2 leads to SG formation [ SOX and its family members are the only proteins identified as global host shutoff mediators in -herpesviruses at present. expression of SOX in uninfected cells does not recapitulate the effects on host mRNA levels that are seen in KSHV-infected cells. this suggests the existence of additional, but unknown, host shutoff mechanisms in KSHV. ICP27 interferes with splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. spliced mRNAs are exported more efficiently than unspliced mRNAs. formation of the spliceosome complex is strongly inhibited in the presence of ICP27 or HSV-1 splicing extracts. splicing prevents phosphorylation of SR proteins and abolishs formation of the cellular spliceosome. newly transcribed pre-mRNAs are processed by splicing, that is the removal of introns (in yellow) through the action of the spliceosome complex. vhs and the splicing-inhibiting factor ICP27 are generally considered the main host shutoff proteins in HSV. it has been clear from early studies that transcription of host genes is also strongly repressed during HSV-1 infection. the difference in Pol II occupancy between viral and host genes suggests that HSV-1 directly and selectively regulates Pol II activity. neither study identified the mechanism controlling transcriptional repression and suppression of transcription termination. the transcription termination defect is not dependent on the known host gene regulators vhs or ICP27. loss of phosphorylation at the serine 2 (Ser2) of the CTD may contribute to shutoff of host transcription during HSV-1 infection. pol II phosphorylation during the post-initiation stage of transcription enables elongation-competent pol II to become elongation-competent. in mock infected cells a Ser5-only form is predominant. loss of ser2 phosphorylation alone would be predicted to lead to increased paused polymerases, whereas loss of Pol II recruitment to transcriptional units was observed. it is tempting to speculate that the loss of Ser2 phosphorylation may underlie the transcription termination defect. some studies have shown that ser5-phosphorylated Pol II can be transcriptionally active on human genes. the best-studied host shutoff mechanism in HSV-1 and -2 and KSHV is mRNA degradation triggered by viral ribonucleases (RNase) the HSV protein UL41, or virion host shutoff (vhs), is an RNA endonuclease [14] of the FEN-1 nuclease family. release of vhs from virions induces accelerated degradation of many cellular [16,17,18], as well as viral, mRNAs [9,19,20]. this ability to degrade both host and viral transcripts enables vhs to control the necessary switch from host to viral gene expression, but also regulate viral mRNA levels. vhs mutations cause increased accumulation of early gene transcripts and a lag of late gene expression, instead of the typical cascade of viral the ORF37 protein is termed shutoff and exonuclease (KSHV SOX and MHV68 muSOX) and its EBV homolog is called BGLF5. the viral AEs have an unclear role in the processing of the viral genome during viral DNA replication, but do not trigger widespread RNA degradation. in -herpesviruses the AEs have an unclear role in the processing of the viral genome during viral DNA replication. -herpesvirus vhs and -herpesvirus SOX are not homologs. a MHV68 strain carrying the R443I mutation in muSOX has been used to study the effects of host shutoff in vivo. RNA endonucleases cut host mRNAs into fragments. the initial cleavage is followed by degradation of the RNA body by the cellular 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1. this mechanism is also shared by non-herpesviral host shutoff RNases. inhibition of transcription mediated by the cellular exonucleases; inhibition of formation of cytoplasmic stress granules. some AU-rich elements containing mRNAs are cut in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), the segment of RNA between the coding region and the 3\u2032 end of the transcript. pol II transcripts are recognized by vhs because of its association with the cap-binding complex. a separate mechanism of RNA targeting has been described for mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 UTR. a mutant of vhs that lacks a nuclear export signal can still degrade ARE-containing RNAs, while it does not degrade other cellular mRNAs like GAPDH [53], underscoring the existence of different targeting mechanisms for these mRNAs. bioinformatics analysis identified a degenerate element that triggered SOX-mediated cuts when transplanted onto reporter RNAs. it is currently unknown whether the SOX-targeting element is directly recognized by SOX or indirectly recruits the nuclease via a cellular factor. it is tempting to speculate that the SOX-interacting factor may be a ubiquitous cellular protein involved in mRNA biogenesis. vhs degradation of early mRNAs is thought to facilitate the transition to late viral gene expression by getting rid of the early transcripts. vhs degradation of early mRNAs is thought to facilitate the transition to late viral gene expression by getting rid of the early transcripts. the viral protein UL47 may also have a role in protecting viral transcripts from degradation. KSHV causes three types of human tumors in immuno-compromised individuals. the endothelial cell-based Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and two rare B-cell lymphomas. lytically infected cells are thought to be important because they produce inflammatory and angiogenic mediators that promote tumor formation. mtDNA-depleting function of the AE is unique to HSV-1 and -2. there is no evidence of expression of UL12.5-like truncated proteins or mtDNA degradation when homologs of UL12 from other herpesviruses are expressed. AE or UL12 do not cause global host shutoff by triggering mRNA degradation. RNA degradation by -herpesvirus vhs and -herpesvirus SOX triggers nuclear relocalization of the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein PABPC. PABPC is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes to the cytoplasm, where it binds the poly(A) tails of mRNAs. ins is directly regulated by PABPC binding to the poly(A) tails of cytoplasmic mRNAs. the decay of cytoplasmic transcripts releases poly(A)-bound PABPC. this process mediates PABPC relocalization to the nucleus. RNA exonucleases Xrn1 and Dis3L2 blocks the feedback loop. the cell senses the exonucleolytic degradation of the RNAs. this feedback is likely a homeostatic cellular response that detects altered RNA degradation as a sign of infection. vhs is thought to facilitate translation of late viral proteins by reducing translational load on the ribosome. vhs inhibition may constitute direct inhibition of cellular stress responses. expression of SOX in uninfected cells does not recapitulate the effects on host mRNA levels. HSV ICP27 inhibition of RNA Splicing In contrast to -herpesviruses, the existence of additional host shutoff mechanisms is well documented in HSV. the multifunctional immediate-early protein ICP27 has roles in transcription and post-transcriptional modifications of cellular transcripts. SRp20 is a member of an essential group of serine-arginine-rich splicing factors. interactions with SAP145 cause inhibition of spliceosome formation and splicing before the first catalytic step [105], interfering with formation of complex A. inhibition of splicing due to ICP27 is naturally selective for host transcripts, as most HSV transcripts are intronless. recent results using 4sU labeling of nascent RNAs have called into question how pervasive the effects of HSV-1 infection are on host mRNA splicing. loss of Pol II occupancy was not observed on viral genes. difference in Pol II occupancy between viral and host genes suggests that HSV-1 directly and selectively regulates Pol II activity. nascent RNA labeling revealed that the transcription of 75% of cellular protein-coding genes is reduced twofold or more during HSV-1 infection. pol II complex by TFIIH, and elongation, mediated by phosphorylation of Ser2 of the CTD by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). both ICP27 and the IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase cause ubiquitination (Ub) and proteasome-mediated degradation of Pol II. studies on pol II phosphorylation during HSV-1 infection may offer an explanation for the suppression of transcription termination and ICP22 is responsible for loss of Ser2 early during infection through its physical association and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), which phosphorylates the CTD at Ser2 to promote elongation [120,121] it is likely that other -herpesviral homologs of this protein have similar effects. multiple mechanisms may provide different functionalities at different steps of the cycle. transcriptional shutoff and RNA degradation may collaborate to definitively shut off induction of immune response genes early during infection. RNA degradation may additionally clear existing RNAs in the cell, preventing new protein production. IAV is a negative strand RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. it replicates in the nucleus of host cells. many strains of IAV have been isolated over the years. delNS1 viruses induce high levels of IFN-stimulated reporter genes. the virus is not lethal in mice unless the animals carry a null mutation in STAT1. NS1 blocks the processing of 3\u2032 end of cellular pre-mRNAs by inhibiting the cellular machinery that carry out this process. NS1 disruption of polyadenylation do not mature properly, the effector domain of NS1 also binds nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN or PABII) and prevents it from stimulating the processive synthesis of long poly(A) tails catalyzed by PAP. this leads to the accumulation of species with short (10 nt) poly(A) tails that are exported less efficiently. viral mRNAs are not processed by the CPSF complex. instead, their poly(A) tail is added by stuttering the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) on a polyuridine stretch on the viral genome segments. NS1-mediated host shutoff is not ubiquitously used by IAV strains. RNA Pol II degradation by the Viral RdRp The trimeric IAV viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp complex targets cellular RNA Pol II for degradation as a means of altering host gene expression. the RdRP associates with promoter regions of genes actively transcribed by RNA Pol II, including protein-coding mRNAs. Pol II degradation would naturally reduce the association between RdRp and Pol II, facilitating the shift from viral mRNA synthesis to viral genomic RNA synthesis. pol II degradation has been reported in many strains of IAV, including both human and avian subtypes. the X-ORF is either 41 or 61 amino acids (aa) depending on the viral strain. only the first 15 amino acids of the X-ORF are strictly required for the full extent of PA-X-mediated shutoff of reporter proteins. reducing PA-X production by mutating the frameshift-promoting sequence results in viruses that elicit stronger immune responses. the PA-X endonuclease activity is dedicated to cleaving pre-mRNAs for the purpose of cap-snatching. PA-X preferentially degrades Pol II-transcribed host RNAs, rather than Pol I and Pol III transcripts. this suggests that the ability of IAV to degrade host mRNAs allows the virus to access cellular translational machinery preferentially. reporter mRNAs that bypass 3\u2032 end processing and end in a hammerhead ribozyme are not degraded by PA-X, even when a templated poly(A) stretch is included. X-ORF residues that prevent nuclear accumulation of PA-X also prevent its degradation of reporter mRNAs. nuclear PABPC1 could prevent newly transcribed RNAs from replenishing the cytoplasmic pool of mRNAs, further reducing the translatable pool of mRNAs and potentiating host shutoff. the mechanism of PA-X-induced SG dissociation and its link to RNA degradation and PABPC relocalization remain to be discovered. at least three different mechanisms of host shutoff are present in IAV-infected cells. at present, it is unclear what the relative contributions and biological roles of these three mechanisms may be. NS1 in the nucleus may impair expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. NS1 Nonstructural viral protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several processes that inhibit the type I IFN responses. it is comprised of an RNA binding N-terminal domain and a C-terminal effector domain. NS1 viruses induce high levels of IFN-stimulated reporter genes. NS1 blocks the processing of 3\u2032 end of cellular pre-mRNAs by inhibiting the cellular machinery that carries out this process. CPSF complex is responsible for cleaving pre-mRNAs downstream of the polyadenylation signal (PAS) during transcription and recruiting poly(A) polymerase (PAP) to add the poly(A) tail to the 3\u2032 end of the mRNAs. these proteins form a complex that interacts with both mRNA and nucleoporins to direct mRNAs through the nucleoporin pore complex. NS1 weakly interacts with and promotes degradation of the nucleoporin Nup98, which likely contributes to export defects. chemical agents that affect NS1-mediated nuclear export block have been identified. strains of avian and swine origin carry NS1 proteins that do not inhibit 3\u2032 end processing. the structure of the NS1 effector domain in complex with CPSF30 indicated that amino acids 103 and 106 are key for NS1-CPSF30 interaction. no study has tested the full extent of the effect of NS1 on host gene expression. the CTD includes a series of tandem repeats that are differentially phosphorylated on Ser2 and Ser5 depending on the stage of transcription. the RdRp-Pol II association has multiple effects. it allows the RdRp to access nascent transcripts. pol II degradation plays a role in circumventing host antiviral response. PA-X is a protein that is produced by a ribosomal frameshift after amino acid 191 of PA 157,158. expression of PA-X leads to reduction in reporter and endogenous gene expression [2,157,162], which is attributed to endonucleolytic cleavage and decreased half-life of the RNAs. the length of the X-ORF (41-aa vs. 61-aa) affects pathogenicity of the virus. in most cases, the stronger immune response triggered by the mutant viruses causes increased pathogenicity of the virus. the length of the tail may be related to host specificity and adaptation. mutants that lack the PA-X RNase show lower, not higher accumulation of viral proteins compared to wild-type infection. this suggests that the ability of IAV to degrade host mRNAs allows the virus to access cellular translational machinery preferentially. this may be coupled with other processes that maintain or increase translational function. this suggests that loss of host shutoff by PA-X alters the balance of viral gene expression in multiple ways. PA-X is similar to several other host shutoff RNases. it cleaves RNAs internally, and degradation of fragments is completed by cellular exonucleases. another similarity between herpesviral RNases and IAV PA-X is the secondary consequences of PA-X activity. NS1 and the nucleoprotein NP contribute to SG regulation in IAV infection. it is unknown whether this is linked to gene regulation changes. stop codons in the +1 reading frame in the X-ORF are found at two very specific locations in almost all IAV strains. different strains of IAV may favor one particular host shutoff mechanism. this is likely true for strains that carry NS1 variants that do not bind CPSF30. this is likely true for strains that carry NS1 variants that do not bind CPSF30. in many ways, it seems counterintuitive that viruses would use such blunt indiscriminate mechanisms to alter cellular physiology, and that they would use multiple versions of them. disparate viruses use similar mechanisms but unrelated viral factors to affect host RNA and protein levels. dissecting the temporal and combinatorial effects of host shutoff modalities in each virus, and to identify endogenous targets that may further clarify the function of host shutoff in the viral replication cycle and in pathogenesis."}
