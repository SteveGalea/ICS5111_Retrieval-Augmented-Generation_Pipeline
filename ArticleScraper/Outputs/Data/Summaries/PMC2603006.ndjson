{"summary": "hCoV-NL63 is associated with up to 10% of common colds. viral plaque assays enable the characterization of virus infectivity. it has not yet been possible to establish practicable plaque assays. hCoV-229E and -NL63 are two prototypic human coronaviruses. hCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 are major causes of common colds in wintertime. hCoV-NL63 was isolated in a seven month old infant with bronchiolitis. cytopathic plaque assays are compatible with high throughput screening [24,25] and facilitate plaque purification and cloning of virus. important technical achievements have been made in studying NL63 replication. hCoV-NL63 replicates slowly and at relatively low titres in all current cell cultures. cytopathogenic NL63 plaque assays can be used for analytical and preparative purposes. cells in six-well plates were infected with 10e4 plaque-forming units of hCoV-NL63 virus stock LLC-MK2 NP. e3 5.00e5 6.29e1 None POEK 8.11e4 3.03e5 3.74e0 None 293lp 3.67e3 3.09e7 8.42e3 None FeA 1.45e4 5.83e5 4.03e1 None RD 3.14e5 1.57e4 4.99e-2 None PS 1.20e4 1.44e6 1.19e2 None LLC-MK2 4.00e3 2.65e6 6.62e2 round and detached, weak effect CaCo-2 cells amplified virus RNA most efficiently, and showed a clearly visible CPE starting from day 4 after infection. cells became rounded, detached from the surface, and showed morphological signs of cell death (Figure 1). hCoV-NL63 was a cytopathogenic effect on human colon carcinoma cells. three overlay techniques commonly used for plaque assays were tested for their suitability. hCoV-NL63 was serially diluted on CaCo-2 cells (10e-1 until 10e-5) cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution. five plaque assays on virus dilution series were done with Avicel overlays and terminated by fixation after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days, respectively. from day 4 onward, plaques were visible in the lowest detectable virus concentration. from day 4 onward, plaques were visible in the lowest detectable virus concentration. aspirated fluid was inoculated in 5 mL of Opti Pro serum-free medium. after infection for one hour and washing, 5 mL DMEM were added. flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for four days. stocks were harvested and stored as described for the original LLC-MK2 stock. hCoV-NL63 may have adapted to hCoV-NL63 during plaque purification. cytopathogenic effects LLC-MK2 and Vero cells do not cause clear CPE on infection with hCoV-NL63. hCoV-NL63 replication by real time RT-PCR using different cell cultures Designation* Day 0 [copies/L] Day 7 [copies/L] Amplification factor Cytopathogenic effect (CPE) Vero E6 6.94e3 3.05e7 4.39e3 None Vero FM 1.78e4 4.51e9 2.54e5 None CaCo-2 3.55e3 1.25e10 3.54e6 round and detached, dead cells with cell debris in supernatant RD human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RKI), PS porcine kidney cells (RKI) and LLC-MK2 African green monkey kidney cells (ATTC CCL-7) showed no significant differences in RNA amplification. in our hands these cells also showed differences in growth of SARS-CoV. LLC-MK2 and CaCo-2 cells were infected at multiplicities of infection of 0.005 for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and supplied with 10 mL DMEM. samples were taken daily from day 0 to 7 and analyzed by real time RT-PCR. plaques were visible with all three overlays, but staining was clearest with Avicel. hCoV-NL63 was serially diluted on CaCo-2 cells (10e-1 until 10e-5) cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution. cytopathic foci were identified by scanning through the wells with an inverted microscope at low magnification, lighting through the clear agarose overlay. the agarose overlay was penetrated with a pipette and 10 to 20 l of fluid was aspirated underneath the overlay. the fluid was resuspended in 100 l of Opti Pro serum-free medium. absolute quantification of virus RNA by real-time RT-PCR yielded 4.8 10e11 RNA copies/mL for CaCo-2 PP and 5.3 10e10 copies/mL for LLC-MK2 NP. hCoV-NL63 may have adapted to caCo-2 cells during plaque purification. agarose overlays (1% final concentration) were prepared by melting 2% agarose at 70\u00b0C, cooling it in a water bath to 42\u00b0C, and mixing it immediately before application with an equal volume of 2 DMEM. two mL of the mixture were carefully applied to each well. Termination at day 3 yielded plaques only at high virus concentration. from day 4 onward, plaques were visible in the lowest detectable virus concentration. Plaques on day 5 were larger, but did not increase in number. stocks were harvested and stored as described for the original LLC-MK2 stock in the Materials and Methods section. the purified virus is hereafter referred to as CaCo-2 PP (for plaque-purified) hCoV-NL63 may have adapted to CaCo-2 cells during plaque purification. hCoV-NL63 replication significantly better than hitherto used culture cells. agarose overlays are preferred for plaque purification. hCoV-NL63 was grown in LLC-MK2 cells in limiting dilution series. it was recovered three times from the last well of a dilution series still showing diffuse CPE. flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and harvested on day four. inoculum was removed after one hour of incubation. real time RT-PCR for hCoV-NL63 with absolute virus RNA quantification was performed. cells were cultivated in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium) with 4.5 g/L Glucose (PAA), supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum \"GOLD\" (PAA), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin 100 concentrate (Penicillin 10000 U/mL, Streptomycin 10 mg/mL) (PAA), 1% L-Glutamine 200 mM, 1% MEM nonessential infection of cells Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at approximately 4 10e5 cells per well and incubated until the monolayer was 70\u201380% confluent. prior to infection cells were washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) double concentrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was prepared by mixing DMEM (PAA) with 9.48 g/L DMEM powder. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
