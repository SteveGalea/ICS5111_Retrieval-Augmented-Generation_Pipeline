{"summary": "the mechanisms involved in how severe influenza infection develops are not fully understood. we and others have shown that homozygosity for a SNP (rs12252-C) is greatly increased in frequency in patients with severe acute influenza. the frequency of this SNP is greatly increased in patients with severe acute influenza. study recruited 99 young healthy volunteers (aged between 18 and 20) who received influenza seasonal Vaccination (H3N2, pdm09H1N1 and FluB) 68 elderly donors (age >65 years) were recruited to compare against the young cohort. 68 healthy elderlies (age >65 years) volunteers without influenza infection in the 6 months were recruited as a control group to compare the levels of antibodies on baseline between the young adults and the elderly. genomes of IFITM3-rs12252 were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyser. one-way ANOVA was employed in inheritance model. a dominant inheritance model was used to assess the effects of SNPs. 68 healthy elderlies (age >65 years) volunteers without influenza infection in the 6 months. single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified using an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyser. HI assays and definition of protection/infection HI assays were performed in duplicate against the influenza vaccine strains. of 99 healthy volunteers, without the experience of an influenza infection within 6 months, were enrolled in the study. 35 donors had the IFITM3 rs12252-CC genotype, 36 donors had the IFITM3 rs12252-CT genotype, and 28 donors had the IFITM3 rs12252-TT genotype. IFITM3 rs12252 genotype P-value CC CT TT Total (68) 24 (35%) 32 (47%) 12 (18%) Age (years) 71.5 6.1 71.6 5.3 68.6 6.1 0.267 Gender (M/F) 10/14 10/22 5/7 n.s.

IFITM3 rs12252-CC carriers exhibit a high level of pre-existing immunity to pdm09H1N1 compared to rs12252-TT carriers. however, no significant differences in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels were observed in young CC carriers when compared to the elderly. a mechanistic study is needed to understand this potential strain specific association with IFITM3 genotype. we speculate the potential differences between different influenza strains in association with IFITM3 genotype could depend on sequencing variation of haemagglutinin that might affect its interaction to IFITM3. having the CC genotype has resulted in more frequent exposure to influenza antigens. this could be worrying for elderly CC carriers as immune responses to influenza virus could be exhausted."}
