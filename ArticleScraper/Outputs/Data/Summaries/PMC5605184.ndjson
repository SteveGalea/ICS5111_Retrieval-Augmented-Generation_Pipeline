{"summary": "a working group has been set up in order to establish a common process of welfare assessment on our new mouse lines. we provide a comprehensive set of services related to generating GA mice on a large scale with a high-throughput phenotypic analysis. this passport will ensure that specific information related to animal welfare is accessible to whoever will care for these lines. the other benefits include improved communication with a real connection between animal caretakers and researchers, new skills acquired for our animal caretakers. Sprague Dawley rats were used in each investigation, with serum corticosterone and blood glucose measured for each individual. a linear mixed model minimally including sex and sequence was used to evaluate the data. the data shows the value of ultrasonic vocalization in assessing welfare in rats. a veterinarian and/or veterinary technician is present for the entire duration of the lab (typically 3-8 h) to monitor the animal and aid in any other procedures such as vascular cut downs. the addition of this training protocol has been praised for its streamlined approach to training labs using live animals. turkeys cannot have a jacket placed to prevent weight bearing on a surgical appendage. a week prior to surgery the turkeys were acclimated in pairs starting with 1 h and ending with 8 h in the sling. a separate study using nontelemetrized dogs would be conducted to construct a full pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profile for each compound. the pharmacokinetic assessment and cardiovascular data can be achieved within 1 study rather than 2 separate studies. wire-mesh caging banks no longer being used to house rat were modified for solid-bottom caging. custom automated water lines were designed that maximize the number of litter boxes per bank. initial bank modifications positioned infusion pumps hanging in front of the animal cages. rats were surgically implanted with either a top-access style VAP or a smaller, lower profile all silicone port. rats were dosed with 0.5 mL of saline, 5-7x per week for up to 90 d. the remaining 20 rat VAPs were not locked with a heparinized saline solution following the saline dose. Sprague-Dawley rats are received with exteriorized catheters. animals are individually housed to protect the exposed cannulas. the improved method uses a protected access button allowing for dual housing. the use of food-grade dye for training in preparation of tumors prior to in vivo implantation provides a clear, uniform model. technicians are trained using real tumors from donor mice. however, tumors are often similar in color to skin and muscle. start-up meetings are conducted with investigators and their staff, the animal resource center, the office of animal research support, and environmental health and safety. such activities could include new investigators, hazardous agents, rodent pathogens, surgery involving USDA species, or any nonhuman primate protocol. hazard-related incidents ranged from 8-17 per year. incidents have been reduced further to 4 per year. daily laboratory animal welfare checks take less than 5 min per cage. a solution is to record animal behavior in a recording chamber. a single 16-camera system cost $1470, and permits longer term animal welfare and behavior assessment. studies have shown multiple benefits of social housing, including promoting species-normative behaviors and decreasing abnormal behaviors. single-housed and paired monkeys showed more stereotypy on days in which there was construction than days without. this increase was significantly more pronounced for the single-housed animals. rhesus macaques faced with unpredictable environmental stressors. we have seen no adverse effects on the health of the animals in standardizing the treatment regimen during and after surgery. by implementing this standard of care through dosing protocols and care modules, we hope to reduce variability in research outcomes. the 3D scanner is an alternative method to calipers to monitor tumor progression in rodents. it can measure tumor size parameters (length, width, and volume), in multiple mouse strains and across a range of tumor models. if successful the introduction of this system could have a large impact for groups running oncology in vivo tumor studies. taking a measurement includes taking the rodent by the scruff (in the same way as with calipers), placing the rodents tumor in the center of the scanning window, and then capturing the 3D data. the software segments the tumor for size and shape data which is then exported for analysis over time. the national research council (NRC) and the candian councill on animal care (CCAC) provide guidelines on the training of personnel working with animals in research. they include that \"all personnel working with animals in science must be knowledgeable about the principles of humane experimental science and ethical issues associated with the use of those animals, including the 3Rs\" genetically modified mouse models for breast cancer research have become a valuable tool to study tumor development, growth rates, and the possible remedies to combat tumorigenesis. a method must be developed to ensure that tumors are reliably detected and consistently measured so a direct comparison can be made between animals and existing data. mice are susceptible to periods of hypothermia especially during anesthetic events, disease states, and environmental stressors. air activated thermal devices (AATD) are mixtures of chemicals that, when exposed to air, cause an exothermic reaction. temperature in IVC cages peaked sharply at 60 min. temperatures in static cages on plastic and metal plateaued at 50 and 100 min respectively. in vivo experiments, mice were surgically implanted with an intraperitoneal temperature telemetry device. the indwelling catheters were successfully maintained over a 72-h period. urine was quantified and samples were obtained. one of 8 indwelling catheters in our study was misplaced. two commonly employed hepatotoxins are carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and thioacetamide. CCl4ultimately alters and damages hepatocyte intracellular and plasma membranes. bioactivation of TAA results in unstable metabolites that covalently bind to proteins and lipids, causing necrosis. a similar degree of liver fibrosis compared to repeated injections of carbon tetrachloride with minimal handling and invasiveness. the results can be used to develop reward strategies for laboratory housed poultry, and inform enrichment decisions. veterinary journals were designated as ARRIVE-supporting (SUPP: 5 journals) or nonsupporting (nonSUPP: 2 journals) based on referencing the ARRIVE guidelines in author instructions. comparisons were made between journal types and between pre (2009) and postARRIVE (2015). tethered infusions in any animal model pose a unique set of problems. many are amplified when nonhuman primates are needed. most of this effort focused on decreasing stress on the animals. improvements to the tethered infusion system increased the level of animal wellbeing, decreased man hours needed per dose, and provided data that was easier to interpret. we have created a training method that uses inanimate training tools for training of various nonsurgical procedures in rodents. modified Hebb-Williams maze to assess affective state in Swiss Webster Mice J Klutzke, B Baker, R Larsen, D Hickman* laboratory animal resource center, Indiana University, Indianapolis,, Afghanistan Assessment of animal wellbeing includes evaluation of overall health, natural behavior, and affective state. hydrodynamic tail vein injection is a rapid DNA administration in a high-volume diluent matching blood osmolarity. the injection results in cellular expression of DNA due to extravasation. the typical side effects are prolonged cessation of movement and shallow, rapid breathing. however, these side effects can escalate to include seizures, moribundity, and even morbidity. our program reduces the number of rodents needed for the training program through humane reuse of donated animals. recently we have begun teaching a new bleeding technique (submental bleeds) that greatly adds to refinement. mice were to be continuously exposed to a drug for 2 wk. the study required the surgical implantation of novel, relatively large programmable continuous infusion pumps in young C57BL/6J (44-d-old) mice. oral swabs are an alternate method to obtain genetic material for genotyping of transgenic rabbits via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the advantage of oral swabs is that no incision of any body tissue is necessary, but rather the constantly renewing upper layer of the mucosa lining of the whole oral cavity is used as a source of DNA material. this nonterminal method of testing 4 samples became known as the 4-sample method. a dried blood spot, an oral swab, an oral swab, a fur or cage swab, and a fecal sample became known as the 4-sample method. the 4SM was lower in cost, had faster turn-around time for receiving results, allowed for the ability to test colony animals without euthanasia. dermal fibroblasts promise to provide a high-throughput in vitro system to evaluate mechanisms of aging. they promise to provide a high-throughput in vitro system to evaluate mechanisms of aging. future studies will focus on structural and functional characterization of fibroblasts using various cell metabolic assays to expand characterization of phenotypic differences. Behavioral neuroscience research requires subjects to be trained to perform repetitions of specific behaviors for food/fluid reward. intravenous tail injections in mice and rats are common concerns. air-activated hand warmers are a viable alternative to conventional heat lamps and warming boxes. no evidence has been presented supporting the use of music enrichment for rabbits. the study was a good first step into providing evidence that music enrichment benefits rabbits. rabbits maintained cortisol levels over the normal range. baseline blood was collected from the existing cohort of experienced and aged Sprague Dawley rats as a nonsocialized control. one group was hand fed a treat in cage 3 times a week and one group was played with by the head researcher 3 times a week. socialized conditions were provided for 4 wk, after which blood (via medial saphenous vein) was collected. mice housed in metabolic cages with or without a mouse tunnel. mice spent 60% of their time in the tunnels during the light period. no significant differences in food consumed, urine and fecal output or food intake. vaginal cytology is the oldest method of staging estrous in female rats. a slim metal rod inserted into the vagina is used to measure the fluctuations in the inherent electrical resistance of the inner lining of the vaginal wall during different stages of estrous. this study simulates the steps taken to produce pseudopregnant females or ensure timed pregnancy. results revealed that vaginal impedance measurements are equally as successful at identifying proestrus in the rat as vaginal cytology. however, impedance measurements were quicker and less technically challenging. female and male mice were tested (n=59) for startle response prior to BM. results were similar with the original BM and the shortened version of BM. independent business monitoring within OAWES is a formal program of quality assurance tied to the care, welfare, and treatment of animals risk area. monitoring against policy, procedures, laws, regulations, and guidance in relation to animal work provides management with up-to-date information on current status of internal control. use of a 5/8 in. needle or dosing with a caudal to cranial approach resulted in delivery of injecta at the deep margin or even outside the muscle, in the deep fascia. lateral approach and a shorter (3/8 in.) needle were successful in keeping the injected material within the target muscle in both feline and ferrets. 72% females and 28% males were surveyed in a self-administered questionnaire during the course. questions focused on ethical consideration for care and use of animals in research, ethical committees, international guidelines for humane care of animals and 3Rs concept and its interpretation. mice were dosed via oral gavage twice daily, 8 h apart, with PBS for 5 consecutive days. no obvious differences were observed between operator groups. the flexible stainless steel 20 gauge had an overall 14% mortality. Sprague Dawley rats were obtained, and complete blood counts and serum biochemistry analyses were compared. the right saphenous vein was used for unlubricated sampling and the left saphenous vein was used for lubricated blood sampling. clinical pathology results showed no significant change in CBC or serum chemistry values. mice that exhibit body condition scores of 1 (emaciated) and 2 (underconditioned) are hard to find at most institutions due to their poor condition and the ethical and humane concerns that arise for keeping them for training purposes. we have created a three-dimensional (3D) mouse model from puppets that exhibit the 5 stages of body condition scoring. these puppet mice can be reused, are easy to make and transport, and alleviate the need to use live animals for body condition training. the finalized CLP model was tested using a resorbable adhesion barrier device. the model was found to meet the requirement for infectivity testing of resorbable adhesion barriers. we adopt refinements, reductions, and replacements, but often fail to give ourselves credit. a knowledge notebook (KN) is a highly configurable and collaborative workspace that can capture and categorize our alternatives efforts. a dashboard would pull the metadata and information from the notebook, creating graphs and charts. to facilitate input into the KN, managers asked to appoint 3Rs champions from each therapeutic research area. tether was connected to the swivel and infusion line above the cage. the catheter identified for up to an 8-h infusion reduced animal restraint time from 7 to 1 min for catheter placement. the animals are harness free during infusion; multiple dosing sessions are possible; and there is an immediate return to social housing postinfusion. independent samples testing of the radiotelemetry data show no statistical difference in average heart rate between handling when ear punching and for routine husbandry. ear punching results in a statistically significant increase in average daily heart rate (P = 0.786) the method of target training means the pigs now enter the weigh crate on their own terms which reduces their stress levels and improves welfare. staff who were not involved in the training commented on how much easier it was and felt like it took less time overall. pigs used for endovascular aneurysm coiling, stent, and embolization training are often used for acute resident training such as craniotomy, durotomy, and brain retractor placement. animals are housed for 72 h with environmental enrichment to avoid stress. group A (n=2) had 14 positive reinforcement training, which consisted of 14 training sessions. this group showed signs of anxiety and fear during handling. group progressed through most of the steps in the plan before hand catching for procedures. staff responsible for behavioral monitoring can quickly assess all colony animals for basic behavioral parameters (alopecia, fecal smearing, and pacing) this data is then automatically updated to the animal\u2019s electronic health record. this data is then automatically updated to the animal\u2019s electronic health record. our facility maintains a corporate policy on animal care and use. the role of an ethical oversight body or an IACUC is to ensure animal welfare compliance. P56 Laboratory Animal Science Training South America: An Experience from the Academic Arena MM Ricca*, M Boric Facultad de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Latin America lags behind in adopting many modern practices concerning care and use of animals. there is poor funding, leading to lack of specialized equipment, lack of adequate facilities, and insufficient staff qualified as LAS trainers. ring on Il10tm1Cgn Mice Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease C Pardo-Roa2,3, G Salazar2,3, MM Ricca*1, S Bueno2,3 1Animal Facility Manager, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. clinical signs of inflammation are diarrhea, perianal ulceration, intestinal bleeding, and rectal prolapse. with 24 mice, using a scale from 0 to 3 in order to assure early detection of colitis and the adequate decision of euthanasia. we found that 100% developed mild and moderate colitis along its life, but not necessarily result on permanent rectal prolapse. guinea pig hearts were perfused with escalating concentrations of sunitinib (0.05, 0.5, and 1.5 M), lapatinib (0.27, 2.7, and 8.1 M), erlotinib (0.43, 4.3, and 13.0 M), and doxorubicin (0.5, 1.0, and 10.0 M) the \u201cRutgers Rats\u201d have been instrumental in training for research procedures, but also in promoting compassion for the laboratory rat. instructors now teach the 3Rs in theory, but also promote it by example. the mission of the NA3RsC is to advance the education and science of the 3Rs. members include academia, industry, and government. in our first year, the NA3RsC elected a board of directors. a recent study was conducted in mice investigating IP ethanol as an alternative to CO2 euthanasia. results suggested IP ethanol overdose is a suitable euthanasia agent in mice. chickens were fitted with ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, and videotaped throughout the experiment. the idea of using a swimming pool is based on the natural behavior exhibited by primate species. submerging treats and food such as seeds and nuts into the water has had a positive impact in rhesus macaques that have no cranial chamber. this limitation led us to fill the pools with alternative materials so these animals can still forage for food and participate in this enriching experience. the number of new laboratory personnel added to an animal study protocol ranged from 10-30 new members a month. the IACUC started hosting a monthly brown bag session during the lunch hour. the session is a combination of a brief lecture and an interactive Q&A session. striatum of Sprague Dawley rats at embryonic day 16 (E16) were isolated and dissociated into single cells. dissociated cells were cultured for 3 d to form cell aggregates known as neurospheres. cryopreserved cells can then be thawed and cultured for only 3 to 4 d. mice with chronically implanted jugular vein catheters were randomly allocated into 6 groups (n=10 each) based on catheter flushing frequency, for example, once every 3 (q. 3), 5 (q. 5) or 7 (q. 7) d, starting 3-4 d after surgery. the STNRD dropped to 20%, 30%, and 50% patency for q.3, q.5, and q.7 respectively. 90% of catheters using the BUTTON remained patent 2 wk postoperatively, irrespective of the catheter maintenance schedule. ammonia concentration was 50 ppm in all continuously ventilated cages. group-housed mice also did not exceed 50 ppm for continuously ventilated cages. the cage-change interval for singly housed mice may be extended to 28 d. records of the observations and sample analysis are entered into a searchable clinical case database. this data helps to further characterize transgenic strains and monitor pathogenic status of the colonies. a daily flow of cases can be handled efficiently to maximize the information gathered. a correlation was noted between poor grip strength and poor nest quality, leading to increased health observations and timely euthanasia. monitoring of nest quality and grip strength provided insights into the health status of aging mice. fluorescein is an organic compound that intensely fluoresces when illuminated under ultraviolet light. fluorescence was appreciated in the pinnae and paw pads of injected mice. lack of fluorescence in the extremities or intense fluorescence around the globe indicated an unsuccessful attempt. results showed a relative increase in social incompatibility with increasing age across all groups except the group of preestablished littermate pairs. over the course of 5 mo, there was a 75% success rate in the group of littermates that were paired at the facility and a 25-50% success rate in the 2 groups of non-littermate pairs. a femoral vein was accessed by extending a hind limb to visualize and palpate the femoral vein. a 21-g, butterfly blood collection set was inserted in the vein. both methods produced similar quality samples based on blood parameters. our approach to hands-on teaching has evolved into a trademarked method known as tthe 3Ts serving the 3Rs. the 3Ts training method aims to promote and share ideas for affordable and effective means to implement the 3Rs alternatives into hands-on training programs. thirty-two female C57BL/6J mice were divided into 2 groups. one group was housed with the enrichment device (E group) and the other group was housed without a device (C group). each cage housed 4 mice. the affected frogs were previously treated for an infestation by an external protozoan ectoparasite (Epistylis spp) treatment consisted of manual removal of protozoan accumulations from the keratinized epithelium of the hind claws. a single, dark red, round, soft tissue mass was identified in all 3 frogs on gross necropsy. experimentally induced teratomas have been described in Marsabit clawed frogs. this is the first description of teratoma development in the western africa clawed frog. a subset of male athymic nude mice experienced significant morbidity on study. endothelin-1 (ET-1) serves a neuroprotective role in the olfactory epithelium. it is hypothesized that direct drug exposure or receptor-mediated effects in the nasal epithelium may lead to the test article-induced injury seen in the treated animals. the lesions resulting from direct drug exposure in the nasal cavity are thought to have led to recurrent obstructive respiration and aerophagia. initial differential diagnoses included dermatophytosis, pododermatitis, and study-related metastatic disease. a trichogram and DTM fungal culture were negative. an impression smear indicated mild neutrophilic inflammation with degenerate neutrophils, however, no bacteria were identified. molecular hydrogen (H2) acts as a therapeutic antioxidant by selectively reducing cytotoxic oxygen radicals. to investigate the effects of H2 on damaged sperm, we prepared oxidative stress-induced low motility sperm. radiographs showed decreased serosal detail in the cranial abdomen. regenerative anemia, few spherocytes, markedly elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphate, and mild-moderate elevations in gamma-glutamyl transferase and bilirubin. a 1-y-old male beagle dog presented with unformed stool with mucus and hematochezia on arrival from the vendor. physical examination revealed no clinical abnormalities. the animal showed no other clinical signs and had a consistent weight gain of approximately 12%. a complete cecal inversion was discovered, and no other abnormalities were noted. this is the first report of a cecal inversion in a naive laboratory beagle. this is the first report of a cecal inversion in a naive laboratory beagle. despite numerous studies of ULK1-/- mice over more than 10 y, this is the first time that reduced survival of homozygous null animals has been noted. this is the first time that reduced survival of homozygous null animals has been noted and our observation skills as research technicians contributed. preliminary data showed hyperglycemia (>100 mg/dL) in 68% of aged animals. blood glucose was not found to correlate with body weight or body condition. animals flagged clinically due to body weight loss and/or poor body condition did not differ from nonclinical animals. clinical signs included mild to severe alopecia, erythema, and scaling of the skin, primarily of the axillae and forelimbs. tape tests failed to identify an underlying etiology outside of normal flora. the lesions were generally unresponsive to husbandry changes, such as alternative bedding types. rhesus macaque was seronegative for maHV-1 and SRV. the animal was presented with self-limiting episodes of hemoglobinuria. a followup bone marrow biopsy confirmed regenerative anemia. microorganisms appear to have trespassed on the facility about a year ago. infection of 3 microorganisms occurred in our laboratory animal facility. the facility could not be cleaned for about a year. hyperthermia was detected in 6 adult female duroc pigs recovering from general anesthesia on multiple dates. the pig is an increasingly popular animal model for wound healing studies in the biomedical research setting. four-wk-old male (n=90) and female (n=30) mice (C57BL/6N) were obtained from Japan SLC every 3 mo and were kept over their lifetimes (male, n=1419; female, n=473, in total) a clear criterion for defining aged mice has not been established. blood tests show the composition of each type of white blood cells tend to change with aging. only a small number of elderly mice (>24 mo) were used. fourteen healthy, male rhesus macaques ranging 3 to 16 kgs and 1-14 years of age were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg IM) the monkey had a history of clinical signs consistent with chronic wasting disease, but had successfully maintained body weight with budesonide treatment. differential diagnoses for myocarditis in a marmoset include spontaneous cardiomyopathy and chronic myocarditis. the cardiac lesions were associated with myocardial degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis. a detailed evaluation of the colony revealed 18 of 62 (29%) mice with facial masses of varying severity. samples cultured from 5 mice revealed mixed infections of Staphylococcal species. the chirping mouse phenotype was observed in a closed-mouse breeding colony used to study calcium regulation. the breeding scheme involved multiple crossings of genetically engineered mice on 2 different background strains. the mice presented with a history of wheezing or chirping. a functional Cacan1h gene have been described with tracheal stenosis. this report emphasizes the importance of monitoring for unanticipated phenotypes when crossing genetically-engineered mice. the disease is a natural erythematous disease of old world monkeys. all 12 infected monkeys were positive to ELISA and PCR. an antiviral agent was used to reduce morbidity and mortality. to prevent SVV outbreaks, we decided to exclude SVV seropositive monkey. a ventilator was administered intraperitoneally as a pretreatment agent. an endotracheal intubation was maintained with 1.5-2.0% of isoflurane. a series of unexpected intraoperative complications and deaths occurred while developing. a porcine model of pediatric kyphosis involved a lateral thoracotomy with pulmonary manipulation to access the ventral spine of 10kg piglets. postoperatively, some animals did not recover well or at all. changes noted included posterior paresis, head pressing, and death. sheep with normal skeletal structure were used as a pain model. a polycarbonate resin boot stabilized the joints and is flexible, strong and avoided moisture breakdown. both sheep receive pain medication. oratory for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Antibodies KU Leuven, leuven, Belgium A 2-y-old, 60 kg female sheep received 3 high doses of cyclophosphamide (CPA) three to four after the first injection, the animal developed stranguria without further clinical abnormalities. the animal developed stranguria without further clinical abnormalities. postmortem examination of the urinary tract showed several pinpoint mucosal nodules in the bladder. histology showed multifocal urothelial ulceration, mild subepithelial splitting, and moderate diffuse superficial mucosal fibrosis in the bladder. an adult female beagle presented with epithelial desquamation on the left shoulder and ventrum after receiving the eighth weekly (20mg/m2) intravenous dose of the free form of doxorubicin. no evidence of ectoparasites was found on trichogram or skin scrape. in dogs, the pattern of cutaneous toxicity has been described to be localized to the paw pads, limbs, axillary, and urogenital regions. in dogs, the pattern of cutaneous toxicity has been described to be localized to the ventrum and trunk, but did not involve the paw pads, axillary, or urogenital regions. animals were maintained under general anesthesia with IO cannulas placed in the proximal and distal tibiae. infusions varied from bolus injections of saline to progressive increases of infusion rates using a programed infusion pump. the rabbit was treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics and topical atropine solution. a superficial central corneal ulcer was diagnosed with fluorescein stain uptake. the cause of the ulcer was not determined, but it was speculated that the rabbit may have inadvertently injured the cornea. nonhuman primate neonates received continuous positive airway pressure. CPAP was administered 12 hours per day for 10 d postbirth. neonatal subjects needed specialized housing and intensive care 24 h a day. the most prevalent complications were transient apnea and extended low SpO2. CPAP administration could be a simple, safe and nonpharmacologic way to improve lung function in MLP infants. tail nodules showed cavernous, blood filled spaces lined by bland endothelium (subcutaneous hemangiomas), partially occluded by organized thrombi. neoplastic cells with round to oval nuclei and 1-2 large nucleoli along with moderate to abundant, amphophilic cytoplasm were noted. mice were injected with 1 million MCF7 human breast cancer cells in the fourth mammary fat pad. a 21-d sustained-release estrogen pellet (0.25 mg) was implanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of the neck. 4 of the 30 mice showed clinical signs of depression and dehydration. eels are fed live prey (fish and earthworms) 2\u20133 times a week. they are fed live prey (fish and earthworms) 2\u20133 times a week. there was concern of a parasitic infection. urine from adult cattle required collection over a 24-h period. the animal was acclimated to and contained in stanchions. a rubber harness was placed on a 1-yold steer for 24 h for 4 consecutive wk. stanchion and device contributed to handler safety. repeatability of collections with no contamination is possible. improvements were or will be made for future studies. subcutaneous implants impregnated with 20% MGA have been successfully used in primates and other species in zoos for contraceptive purposes. in this case, the female macaque was treated with an approximately 3.5 in.long, 0.38 in.diameter MGA implant that was placed subcutaneously between the scapulae. three affected birds were necropsied and tested for avian virus isolation, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and avian paramyxovirus-1. the mites were positively identified as Ornithonyssus sylviarum. an 11-y-old female nulliparous, experimentally naive common marmoset presented with a 4-y history of previous intermittent depression and decreased ambulation upon arrival from another institution. the animal developed difficulty ambulating and tachypnea after 2 y in stable condition. the animal was euthanized due to deteriorating quality of life. histopathological diagnosis included bilateral chronic progressive nephropathy, fibrous osteodystrophy of bones and mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic mucosal enteritis and typhlocolitis. six juvenile NHPs, all within the same age and weight range, were sedated for study-related blood collections. half received ketamine alone, while the other half received a dexdomitor/ketamine cocktail. a dexdomitor/ketamine cocktail sedation is a viable chemical restraint alternative. low-level laser therapy is reported to have analgesic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects and has been shown to accelerate wound healing of non-UD origin in several species. low-level laser therapy requires purchase of equipment and may be inappropriate for lesions on the face. experimental history included 2 MRIs to obtain baseline cardiac structural data. no abnormalities were detected except for acute cranial swelling. subperiosteal hematoma secondary to trauma, hemostatic disorder, or collagen defect. intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) is a potential complication in breeding colonies of any species. the causes of IUFD are varied and can include congenital malformation, hemorrhage, infection, or occult maternal disease. study of individual NHP colonies in Texas and Louisiana found as high as 23% seroprevalence depending on geographic location and age. study hypothesized T. cruzi infection in a closed, outdoor-housed breeding colony of rhesus macaque in Bastrop, Texas. an overall 9% seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection was found in the total population of adult, juvenile, and weanling NHPs. there appeared to be an increase in reproductive complications when comparing seropositive and seronegative females. the most common causes of morbidity are attributed to diarrhea and trauma. the main purpose of using a point-of-care blood analyzer is the immediacy in identifying and correcting electrolytes and acid-base imbalances. the majority of the animals respond well to the initial treatment and corrective measures. the accuracy, speed, and utility of point-of-care style blood analyzer are essential when working with nonhuman primates. stitium with a paucity of tubules, numerous tortuous arteriolar profiles, presence of fetal-type glomeruli, and foci of primitive mesenchyme were also present. no evidence of renal insufficiency or uremia was present. postmortem cystocentesis was consistent with mild lower urinary tract inflammation. post-BAL CT imaging was performed on 4 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) followed by BAL, in which PBS was instilled in the right lung of study animals. the lungs were reimaged immediately after BAL and every 24 hr until no pulmonary changes were evident. 4 genetically engineered mice tested positive for Salmonella spp. by pooled fecal sample (PCR) the mice were shipped from the noncommercial source via ground transport in an undamaged, single, 3-compartment, plastic crate. individual rectal and fecal cultures confirmed only 1 (singly housed) of 4 mice was positive for Salmonella spp. 15-mo-old jill presented with mild, green mucoid diarrhea 3 d after arrival from vendor. on physical exam, she was afebrile, in fair body condition, and exhibited mild, intermittent tremoring. she was treated with 4-d course of Albon, subcutaneous fluids, and nutritional support. a time period from parturition to weaning has been associated with mortality of neonates in cases of epizootic catarrhal enteritis in mink, a similar disease to FRECV. if this infection is suspected based on clinical presentation, definitive diagnosis can be achieved by PCR of fecal or intestinal samples. coronavirus is endemic in the laboratory ferret population. it is not always associated with characteristic clinical signs, such as diarrhea, lethargy, or dehydration. a pelleted ferret diet mixed with water improved palatability. patient 2 had a full triceps muscle transection that was repaired. the animal was put in the exercise tunnel for 10 d of daily peanut PT. both animals were later released successfully to social groups. a dilated stomach was found to contain 14 small river stones. this is the third documented case of substrate ingestion occurring in an electric eel. this is the third documented case of substrate ingestion occurring in an electric eel. physiological data were collected from equal numbers of both male and female. include weight and body measurements, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, urinalysis, ECG rhythm and segment intervals, and organ weights, including the brain and pituitary gland, thoracic organs, reproductive organs. over 200 tables of data are presented to veterinarians, biomedical investigators, preclinical clients, and university staff to facilitate research when using our miniature swine animal models. the complexities of breeding genetically engineered models (GEM) has increased with the abundance of techniques available to modify the genome. conditional models were generated to get around lethal phenotypes, namely, introducing the deletion at a certain age, or in a tissue-specific manner, etc. data has been collected on over 40 different alleles with several of these conditional Cre deleters. for the leaky alleles, the overall percentage of penetrance varied from 0.05% to 80%. group-housing rabbits can be difficult due to social hierarchies to assert dominance within the group. the goal of this project is to demonstrate the functionality and success of group-housing rabbits. the rabbits were fed ad libitum in feeders with an automatic watering system that allowed all rabbits to have a source of feed and water source accessible at all times. a rabbit enrichment program was developed to maximize the natural behaviors expressed by the rabbits, reduce abnormal behaviors, increase normal patterns, and cope with the artificial environment and inevitable limitations of space imposed by a research facility. we wanted to develop enrichment that would maximize the natural behaviors expressed by the rabbits, reduce abnormal behaviors, increase normal patterns, and cope with the artificial environment. the flipbooks are a small 4 in. by 4 in booklet that contains colorful pictures. they are hung on or near equipment such as anesthesia machines, euthanasia systems, and radiology machines. they are laminated for ease of cleaning which enables them to be placed in animal housing and procedure rooms. the changes were made with not only animal needs in mind, but also ease of use by staff, storage requirements and also cost as compared to purchasing new world monkey specific caging systems. our colony of 200 beagle dogs remain in the facility for 4-4.5 y. two breeding rooms containing 450 cages per room of mixed strains were placed on cellulose bedding for 4-6 wk, followed by a return to corn-cob bedding for 2-4 wk. total number of cages spot-changed on cellulose bedding showed a 3-fold decrease compared to corn-cob and did not affect breeding. alignment of teeth prevents normal wear of tooth surfaces. treatment requires restraining or sedating the animal and clipping incisors. clipping of incisors only manages the misaligned teeth. a study was undertaken to measure the water consumption of adult marmosets every 3 h during the 12-h light cycle for the months of January and July. the average water intake per animal was 38.71 ml/kg/day. however, water intake by an individual marmoset was fairly consistent from day to day. we have a global Enrichment Committee that incorporates active members from each of our 6 sites that works towards harmonization of enrichment practices. one of our hot topics is attempting to standardize rodent (specifically mouse) enrichment and social housing practices, which has proven to be quite challenging. 48 instructional protocols were categorized based on type of animal involvement. 35% (n=16) provided training information using a multimodal approach. 33% (n=15) provided training through in-person discussion alone. exhaust air duct (EAD) PCR of individual racks is much more expensive than using one soiled-bedding sentinel cage per rack. the ultimate goal of this study is to develop a cost-effective EAD testing alternative to soiled-bedding sentinels. sentinel serology, sentinel PCR, and EAD swabs detected no organisms. the number of organisms detected on individual racks was not statistically significant. pooled rack samples may be a cost-effective alternative to individual rack samples. a technician practice of placing a scoop of feed into the rodent hopper led to overfilling and had negative consequences. this practice resulted in feed wastage when feed was discarded and pellets were spread over the entire wirebar lid, potentially obstructing the normal flow of air within the ventilated cages. we removed the potential for airflow obstruction within the cage, improved ergonomics, and improved the day-to-day working experience. owl monkeys are nocturnal new world primates that are easily stressed by handling, restraint, and changes in routine and personnel. a positive reinforcement training program was established to minimize handling stress and risk associated with cage changes. it took a single technician an average of 4.16 min to change 1 cage (range 1.25-6.41 min) active training could have stopped after 3 wk, requiring a minimum time investment of only 10-15 min/day. the positive association with food rewards and the alternative method of cage changing successfully minimized stress, eliminated handling risk and reduced the personnel time requirement. control groups of 6 cages each were evaluated over a 16-wk period. a complete cage bottom change occurred with control groups. a disposable paper tray was used to remove 2/3 of the bedding. the results of the study were summarized and compared to cost. the results of the experiments were summarized and compared to cost. the results of the experiments were summarized and compared to cost. the paper strips were the least expensive at $4 per 100 cages. nest scores were highest (4.5/ 5) when the combination enrichment was used. this was counter-balanced with the cost savings. intracage NH3 levels were nondetectable for most cages at all time points with only 1 cage reaching 7 ppm in the first week. no differences in NH3 or CO2 were observed between any of the 3 caging types based on a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. the holiday treat competition was a success with the majority of sites participating. each holiday the competition grows and the treats are more creative. a strong biosecurity program is key to protecting research animals. aHP surface disinfectants are sanitizing agents composed of hydrogen peroxide, surfactants, wetting agents, and chelators. they are sanitizing agents composed of hydrogen peroxide, surfactants, wetting agents, and chelators. aHP manufacturer confirmed there is no chemical present in aHP that would auto-luminesce. the smallest known mammal has an adult body mass of 2 g. the smallest known mammal has an adult body mass of 2 g. the shrews are provided wood chips and autoclaved peat bedding. a customary skin scraping revealed the presence of an unidentified mite. a different type of mite was discovered in the shrew bedding. the infestation has been treated with topical dilute selamectin on shrews. the prevalence of pododermatitis was approximately 9.6% (111/1160), in which the oversized animals were affected the most. only 14.6% (6/41, number recovered/number treated, recovery rate) of the mild to moderate injured animals responded to an intensive antibiotic treatment for 7 wk. the incidence of pododermatitis was below 1% and mostly occurred in late pregnant females. silicone pads are relatively cheap, easy-to-clean, autoclavable, and reusable, making it an excellent alternative to solid-bottom cage to control pododermatitis. we recently isolated several atypical strains of enteric bacteria, tentatively identified as E. coli from a high-fat, purified diet. these strains defy ready characterization by biochemical profiling, mass spectrometry, and molecular sequencing of the 16s rRNA (rrnB) and b-subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoB) gene targets. mice were randomized to 3 alarm exposure groups (no-alarm, alarm-during, and alarm-before) and placed in individual, photobeam-activated locomotor chambers. the alarm-during group displayed significantly reduced horizontal locomotion and trended towards reduced vertical locomotion. water valves were tested before and after cleaning using a combination of ATP monitoring system, ATP luminometer, and sterile swabs for bacterial culture. the average time for cleaning of water valves during cage change was 3.2 0.16s (n=116), and decreased ATP RLU from 10622 to 71 (n=60) nutritional shake mix is used to soften standard monkey chow. a compound is added to deionized water in sanitized carboys. the compound was added to deionized water in sanitized carboys. microbiological samples were taken from several different sources at set intervals. animals were checked daily for overall general health. the first set of tests showed unacceptable results so upon further investigation, it was discovered that the tubing from the water faucet was contaminated. the nests were scored on 6 separate days over the 2-wk periods between cage changes. for the singly housed males, the bulk crinkle paper and 8g compact crinkle paper pucks allowed all mice to build cupped or dome-shaped nests with average, mid-study scores of 4.2 and 3.8. the majority of these nests were completed within the first 24 h following introduction of the nesting material. temperatures were recorded every 60 s for 20 min using an infrared thermometer. heat lamps posed the greatest risk for hyperthermia and thermal burns. the reusable chemical heating pad produced a high bedding temperature of 34\u00b0C. the number of animal husbandry employees our department has hired has decreased every year over the last 3 y. the smallest terrestrial mammal by mass (adults average 2g) is one of the fastest tactile hunters in the world. molded concrete habitats serve as a tunnel and nesting system for each breeding pair of shrews. the system allows the husbandry and veterinary staff to clearly view the adults and pups without causing disruption. 4% of the animals on these studies were evaluated for injuries to the mouth, feet/digits, or tail (30/715) it is unclear if these injuries were a direct injury from barrier design, aggression through the barriers, or simply coincidental. the IACUC determined that they did not provide social housing per the Guide. no abnormal behaviors have been observed in these animals in their new housing arrangement. pigeons in flight rooms with the space and complexity to support a larger repertoire of species-typical behaviors appears to have improved animal health and wellbeing. culture results were negative for both strains of bacteria after processing using the rack washer, or when valves were processed face down in the rack washing tray in the tunnel washer. validation of sanitation effectiveness is recommended when using cagewash systems to sanitize water valves. the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical Laboratories (biosafety in microbiological and biomedical Laboratories) indicates there are several other acceptable methods for decontaminating biohazardous materials from ABSL 2 housing. the ATP bioluminescence assay provides an accurate indication of disinfection and can be used independent of contact plates when assessing sanitation. the ATP bioluminescence assay provides an accurate indication of disinfection and can be used independent of contact plates when assessing sanitation. a breeding colony of nearly 400 transgenic new Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a breeding colony of nearly 400 transgenic white rabbits. a subset of dominant rabbits approached a novel enrichment item in 35 s or less. the majority of subordinate rabbits took over a minute to approach the item. rabbit that scored opposite to them on the temperament test was successful. however, 100% of pairs created with this modified method were successful. if pairing animals already in the facility, explore temperament testing. a team of husbandry supervisors focused on enhancing animal care technician optimism and drive while minimizing institutional cost. a brisk walk directed toward a work-related location was devised to help combat the day-to-day monotony. the plan included a walk directed toward a work-related location. team members were encouraged to ask questions and share information on things they might not know about the university's hospital and campus. information included whereabouts of secure building access points, security stations, employee occupational health, and parking garages. both species are housed in similar environmental temperatures (75-80\u00b0F) green tree pythons are housed in cages with perches to accommodate their tree-living habits. ball pythons are housed in a repurposed rodent cage and given ground-level hiding areas. rabbits may be given edible enrichment, such as hay, in addition to their normal pelleted diet to stimulate appetite. study was designed to evaluate potential appetite stimulant properties of hay in different contexts. four long-term rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 2 males and 2 females, are used for training protocols. the rabbits were singly housed in standardized rabbit caging. the rabbits were singly housed in standardized rabbit caging. the pica phenomenon is a response to the stimulus that induces emesis in species that have an emesis reflex. since rats lack this reflex, it is thought that the pica behavior is analogous to emesis. modifications should be made to the housing of the rats to prevent the animals from consuming bedding or any other items that can be harmful if ingested. tech-ops staff have a large amount of contact with the animals but have limited involvement in veterinary care. tech-ops staff established weekly veterinary rounds during which tech-ops leaders meet to focus on active protocols in which animals may present with unusual symptoms, have unexpected adverse outcomes or require a tailored approach to veterinary care. an incident of intrafamily fighting occurred recently involving the fifth-ranked family of a large breeding group. this resulted in 4 cases of rhabdomyolysis or moderate female-inflicted trauma and 6 cases of male-inflicted trauma. automated feeders can assist management staff with monitoring group stability. in 2016, 65% of our animal care and cage wash staff had never experienced an AAALAC accreditation site visit. each staff member was given a laminated flash card booklet, held together by a ring clip. the booklets were easy to prepare, inexpensive, and will be updated and edited readily as SOPs and reminders may change for husbandry staff over time. a lab animal institution has implemented an approximation of the number of weaned mice per cage (WMPC) based on historical data, the number of weaned mice per cage (WMPC) can present a significant challenge as hundreds of mice are weaned each day. a manual census count of adult mice was performed in small and large vivaria. the results were based on a manual census count over 2 wk in both small and large vivarias. a deviation ranging from +0.2-0.8 for the former and +0-0.95 for the latter was calculated. the negative control did not receive EE, and the positive control received only nesting material. each mouse was observed for a 5-m period during the first 4 wk, the middle 4 wk, and the final 4 wk. the prevalence of stereotypic behavior was not highest in the negative control as hypothesized. the writing mentorship enabled the student to gain an understanding of the specific SOP and related policies and procedures. students were asked to select a numeric value to reflect current writing skills, familiarity with SOP writing, and knowledge on key aspects of SOP development. the cages were moved from a ventilated rack to a shelf rack in a low traffic location in their original animal room. the parameters of the timed pregnancies were adjusted with the vendor to ensure that first time mothers were not being delivered and arrival was earlier in their gestation. a dedicated animal care technician was trained on the unique caging environment. review and approval of biohazardous, chemical, or radionuclide substances proposed to be used in conjunction with protocols. implementing a longer renewal cycle in the electronic protocol repository system for nonregulated species\u2019 AUPs. global Regulatory group and IACUC administrators have been consolidated into 1 team. rabbits needed to be maintained on a soft diet with restricted access to enrichment devices. rabbits were acclimated prior to surgery to a specialized diet. daily health checks and weekly weights were used to monitor the rabbits' condition. a black light for vaginal plug detection is a simple, inexpensive method that could lead to more successfully identifying conception and refine timed mating protocols. a new alternative has emerged where bedding is placed on a raised, perforated floor and air is passed through the bedding at much lower airflow rates. wireless sensors were also used to measure ammonia inside the cage. each cage received a wireless sensor that took a measurement every 2 h for the duration of the 18-wklong study. color change sensors were placed in select cages on day 17 after opening the lid. the new design places bedding on a perforated false bottom and passes air through the bedding. if the bedding is too soft, the metal floor will act like a sieve and the bedding will crumble and fall through the holes designed for airflow. communication has greatly improved between all members of the facility. there were 2 specific issues that were able to be improved with the use of this technique. a standardization of work and the problem-solving cycle were chosen. guide to Managing Mouse Trio and Harem Breeding Colonies. based on recommended housing space of a mouse breeding pair + litter, birth of a second litter from an additional female would exceed recommended floor space requirements when using a 75 in.to 82 in. standard mouse cage. comparative medicine (CM) team is made up of a large and diverse group of individuals. these areas included staff engagement, trust, communication, retention, and transparency. many ideas were put forth resulting in the formation of various committees and a formal CM mentoring program. 3,000 sq ft was remodeled, making housing rooms for rats and mice with HVAC, autoclave and cleaning area, warehouse, procedure rooms, and security. the newly built TAF allowed us to enforce centralized operations (previously spread across campus), reorganize personnel and management, and establish clear objectives and monitoring. a single collection of qualitative data points can show you where your colony is. consecutive scores can show you if any trends are developing (for good or bad) a qualitative assessment is inherently subjective. a qualitative assessment is inherently subjective. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) can create unwanted scientific variation when encountered on drug safety assessment studies. a multidisciplinary global working group was formed to execute this project. potential contributory factors were identified and included increased psychogenic stress during shipping/arrival, acclimation, social grouping or regrouping. zebra finches lose a large percentage of their young offspring, mainly due to predation. potential causes such as extremes in temperature and changes in research/husbandry staff were ruled out. a cooperative effort was initiated to clean nest boxes between clutches and relocate juveniles out of the home cage. 6 new humidity control sensors were installed in animal rooms in 2010. the sensors were programmed so the mean reading was used to modulate the humidifier valve. the sensors were programmed so the mean reading was used to modulate the humidifier valve. test paddles from cages with and without animals were negative for bioburden. no specific microbial content was identified by an external diagnostic laboratory. current husbandry practices employed for controlling pH and bioburden can accommodate a 7-d cage change cycle for severely immunocompromised mice. the AHU was connected to 2 individually ventilated mouse racks with plenums appropriately sealed. this equipment and its room were VHP exposed and decontaminated using a VHP generator and aeration system. as the housing room air dissipated the H202 levels to 1 ppm. we examined the effects of breeding environment made by humans, such as handling, cage change, and restraint on longterm breeding of rats. sixteen to 35 male rats (F344/NSlc, 4-wk-old, approximately 200 g body weight) were obtained from Japan SLC every 3 mo. e in flooded cages are common occurrence in most animal facilities. morbidity in rodents can be documented due to hypothermia, reduced mobility, and dermatitis. a large rodent population mandates that husbandry and veterinary staff are trained to handle these cases using the same protocols. EU-standard social housing is now the default housing configuration for nonhuman primate drug development studies. it provides a safe, comfortable accommodation enabling the animals to engage in species-specific behaviors. there may be instances when animals must be separated to obtain samples, with the accompanying potential to induce stress. research rabbits are often singly housed due to fear that grouping may lead to aggression. the guide states single-housing social species should be the exception. playpen program gives opportunity to positively interact with rabbits in a rewarding environment, reducing risk of compassion fatigue. group-housing females may be feasible if study is not impaired by skin wounds or systemic NSAID treatment. measurement of ammonia levels is important because high levels have been shown to cause nasal subclinical degeneration and inflammation, rhinitis, and olfactory epithelial necrosis. but measuring ammonia levels is often cumbersome, inaccurate, or high cost, thus limiting performance-based changing. the wireless sensor\u2019s automatic readings and high-frequency, every 2-3 h, made a qualitative improvement in the level of monitoring. our gnotobiotic animal facility uses 4 different types of testing and evaluation. swine require daily insulin injections to control blood glucose, frequent blood glucose checks for insulin adjustments, specialized feed, close monitoring for any dietary, health, or wound abnormalities, and diabetes appropriate enrichment. the swine maintained healthy weights, had no nonexperimental procedure associated hypoglycemic procedure associated hypoglycemic. the opportunity to nest is an important form of enrichment for the laboratory mouse. the study was conducted in 3 phases, each lasting for 2 wk. each group was given a different nesting material for each phase. mice made good quality nests with Material C, but took longer to use it. further studies would evaluate a broader range of nesting materials with different mouse strains. the frequency in which general isolator maintenance is performed may vary based on the durability of the isolator parts. isolators were used to monitor the daily inspection of both the left hand and right hand of the gloves for approximately 6 mo. no results showed the length of time a glove could remain in tact before a pinhole developed. the majority of pinholes detected in the gloves occurred less than 40 d after the new pair of gloves was installed. despite responding favorably to treatment, the overall condition of the dog\u2019s feet did not improve and the cysts would recur. we hypothesized that rough-coated flooring could increase wear and improve the condition of the feet. staff to a 7-day instead of a 5-day roster, and 3) employ casual staff. a staff budget increase was not possible as budgets are locked in a year in advance. talented postgraduate students were already working in the animal facilities. the quality of steam from your boiler is vital since it plays a critical role in your autoclave operations. it took over a year to troubleshoot the entire residue issue and almost 2 y before all of the negative factors were successfully addressed. we implemented protocol-specific signage for approved animal procedures and humane endpoints in each animal holding room. these signs contain the IACUC approved protocol number, bulleted approved procedures or humane endpoints for that protocol. this has relieved some of the burden on the technicians by making their vital jobs easier. a cargo van was rented from a local rental agency and was parked inside a large, air-conditioned room at the facility. a window air conditioner, humidifier, dehumidifier, air deodorization device, and a LED lamp were set inside the cargo area without changing the original state of the car. a dilution of sodium hypochlorite would outperform the current standard treatment, povidone-iodine/silver sulfadiazine cream, when each is administered at a frequency of 3x a week rather than daily. new cases randomly assigned to 4 topical treatment groups. a novel individually ventilated cage system delivered controlled humidity at the cage level to breeding mice in an arid winter environment. a step-up transformer was added to offset low water conductivity level (100us/cm) no significant differences in cage ATP or ammonia. beetles are a nuisance to manage and to eliminate due to their high fertility rates, long life spans, and resistance to common pesticides. a drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum) infestation was identified and localized to a biological safety cabinet within a mouse housing room in a primarily rodent facility. the key to this process is striking a balance between the quantity of what is being given and the quality of the enrichment that it is providing to the animals. shredded paper and compressed cotton squares were introduced into the cages of 6 commonly used strains of laboratory mice at specific ratios. tive Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL zebrafish tanks present an obstacle in tank labeling. some users use vinyl film label which may peel off leaving the tank unlabeled. some users turn to mailing label style identification which is difficult to remove and leaves a residue on the tank. holder with an RFID imbedded card holder can be checked out of the database. research staff have been trained that any cage checked out of the hotel before 3 pm will be checked out that night and not incur an additional day per diem charge. Octopus vulgaris is housed individually in tanks with appropriate substrate and den as enrichment and fed every day with live crabs. each tank and on daily basis is possible to collect information on animal data (sex, arrival date, weight, indicators of physical state, posture, locomotor activity during attack, and assessing normality of predatory behaviour) metal washers with central diameters of 1.5 and 2.0 cm allow tumors to be identified as they approach or reach the maximum tumor diameter for mice. this allows animal care staff to communicate with researchers and veterinary staff to increase the frequency of tumor monitoring and intervene before an animal welfare issue occurs. the frame segment was made using 1 in. polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. mesh material ripped and stretched easily, and button socket snaps for attachment opened during abrupt movements. a strap nestled over their back secured them to the sling by buttons. clear-cast acrylic ambulation chamber measured 8 ft long x 2 ft wide x 4 ft tall. it was fitted with a main access door for the monkey to enter and leave naturally, multiple air vents, and openings on each end for enrichment treats. the engagement committee has morphed into a collection of employees from several different departments and runs numerous activities monthly both inside and outside of work. the activities offered by the committee improve work relationships among the different departments, increase morale, and promote positive group dynamics. Approximately 10 machines were being serviced per day over 2 d on campus A, and 10 machines on campus B over the course of 1 d. a new system for scheduling and servicing anesthesia machines was developed. two months prior to service, emails specifically tailored to campus A and campus B research staff are sent. commercially available tube holders held multiple tubes allowing for debris to collect in the unused wells. commercially available mouse restrainers for IV dosing are expensive ($400 each) and do not hold up to needed cleaning and disinfection procedures. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are notoriously difficult to pair, especially after an extremely long period of single housing. we brought in a small colony of aged males from another facility where they had previously been successfully paired with juvenile males. these males are considered to be senior citizens and are of wild-caught mauritian origin. adult mice implanted in the scapular region with a next generation radio frequency identification (RFID) transponder experienced minimal transponder migration, loss, and tissue reactivity. the transponders provide permanent reliable identification and increase efficiency of long-term neonatal to adult dosing. rhesus macaques received 6 x 30ul doses of 10% acetic acid into the submucosa of the middle right cheek via a micro syringe. on day 4 after the procedure, a lesion appeared. 300ul of virus was slowly dripped into the top of the casing and held in place for approximately 5 min. behavior modification is often necessary to improve efficiency, improve animal welfare, or improve safety. but, to achieve this, we have to overcome a natural resistance to change that is embedded in behaviors that are comfortable and familiar. 4 pathogenic bacteria through our 4-plex PCR assay were successfully identified in the lung of experimentally infected mice. our 4-plex PCR assay will be applied as a useful method for detecting pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases of laboratory animals. our journey in retrofitting vivarium space for gnotobiotic use. a gnotobiotic component to their animal research program must be considered. a consultant provided recommendations on infrastructure changes to make the space more conducive for gnotobiotic procedures. a number of veterinary management software products were evaluated and the business processes for animal health record keeping were standardized across multiple sites. a number of veterinary management software products were evaluated and the business processes for animal health record keeping were standardized across multiple sites. CM continuously evaluates its goals to ensure improved workflows and software alignment while leveraging the functionality of the electronic health records. protocol management system effectively doubles as means by which potentially noncongruent items are communicated to the PI. team tracks the results of all congruency reviews to gather metrics on common congruency issues. commonly used pain assessment tools in mammalian species include the grimace scale or behavioral changes which are difficult to apply to amphibians. animals were divided into control and treatment groups (n=6 per group) treatment groups received buprenorphine injection (50 mg/kg every 24 h for 48 h by intracoelomic route) or butorphanol immersion (0.5 mg/L or 0.75 mg/L every 24 h for 48 h for 48 h for 48 h) cynos are notoriously difficult to pair (and re-pair) once established groups/pairs have been broken up for study or aggression reasons. they are sedated (ketamine/midazolam) and allowed to recover together in an unfamiliar housing room. cynos can come into recovery with temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) a committee of passionate employees created a day in which children of fellow employees would be invited to come and learn more about our work and the tasks we do every day to bring safe treatments to the world. children of fellow employees were invited to come and learn about our work and the tasks we do every day to help bring safe treatments to the world. success of the Journey into Research can be seen from the smiling faces of participants, discovered through positive feedback received. a positive impact on the public\u2019s perspective will be realized because the families of employees were given the opportunity to ask questions and receive the truth about CROs. most rodent surgeries in the research environment are performed using isoflurane. tail vein illumination device was developed using computer aided design (CAD) and rapid prototyping with 3D printing. 7 out of 8 mice were injected over 27 min on the first attempt. results are determined by the number of animals injected on the first attempt. the lateral design also prevents user blinding when the tail in lifted out of the tapered slot. together, this device allows for accurate tail vein identification, reduces multiple injection attempts, and increases efficiency and throughput. the inside of modern mouse caging can be dark and lead to difficulty in visualizing the animals and cage environment. a hand-held light source is a widely used method to improve visibility inside cages. mice have limited ability to see into the long wavelength or red light spectrum. our results demonstrate a refinement to routine health check practices by reducing a daily disruption to their environment while continuing to ensuring animal welfare. it can be overwhelming to work in such a caring and emotionally charged environment without finding oneself facing challenges in dealing with those emotions. helping employees deal with their feelings ensures a positive impact on the employees, their jobs, and ultimately their animals as well. implementing a comprehensive electronic system to facilitate workflow and system management will result in better performance. a 2-step approach to ensuring Proper Sanitization of Principle Investigator-Owned Equipment can yield meaningful data that can be used to assess the success of a new system. multiple campuses and animal husbandry buildings can increase the risk of equipment not being properly sanitized/disinfected. the new SOP ensures the efficacy of sanitation and disinfection in accordance with the animal welfare act and the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. the IACUC will review the SOP ensuring that the equipment meets the criteria for the policy. Genentech, Inc., south San Francisco, CA has placed a self-help station in a conspicuous location in the vet staff office area. the station is equipped with the following items: child dilution sheets to add to parent stock drug log given at time of controlled drug checkout. the goal is to have them feel comfortable using properly identified sterile vials, pharmaceutical grade saline, and administering the drugs. the majority of the labs are using these supplies, and are complying with requirements. users have expressed their satisfaction with the convenience of this help yourself supply station. a sock restraint system was developed for use during compound administration. the cagewash machine\u2019s programing was changed to allow a 165\u00b0F guarantee on the final rinse, however the set point for delivered water temperature was not changed (190\u00b0 F). this allowed the incoming water to meet the USDA requirement for 180\u00b0F final rinse temperature and achieve the time/temperature requirement. daily assessment of humane live traps in room/housing areas can become labor intensive. the practice at our institution is to place traps at the intersection of the floor and wall and load traps with a solitary rodent chow pellet. external site visitors recommended that, in areas where routine trap checks were challenging, a fluid source be added. ORIP improves animal research by modernizing research facilities and supporting development, preservation, and sharing of animal models of human disease. environmental conditions like temperature, light, or feed affect animal behavior and metabolism, and thus may modify study outcomes and affect experimental reproducibility. a single-card system identifies animals on experimental studies, provides legible information including dates of activities, procedures performed, and/or substances administered to the animals. a cage-side method to identify these animals is ideal as the information is available in real time during animal observations. a large number of blastocysts are required to produce chimeric rats. this study was performed to produce ES cell chimeric rats using cryopreserved blastocysts. ES cells were gene-modified by CRISPR/Cas9. they were injected into vitrified-warmed blastocysts of long-evans x Brown-Norway F1 rats. the time schedule control of ES cell injection was easier in vitrified blastocysts of host embryos. anterior tibial artery segments measured 668 mm in length and 2.180.31mm in diameter. posterior tibial artery segments measured 856 mm length and 3.120.28 mm in diameter. four skin samples were collected by 8 mm punch biopsy from 18 animals. the number of hair follicles per surface area was first enumerated. each interfollicular measurement was taken at random and in triplicate. exhaust air particles sampling is being proposed as a powerful tool to increase the sensitivity of detection of a variety of microbiological agents. this system relies on a dedicated sliding filter placed before the exhaust air prefilter of IVCs air handling units. each unit served 2 double-sided racks housing 280 cages. postpartum depression and anxiety disorders are disabling mood disorders. most depression research in animals only includes males. this limitation has led to significant gaps in our knowledge of these common disorders. the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of mouse Cytomegalovirus AM Braxton*1, JK Brockhurst3, K Najarro4, CG Cryer1,3, S Guerrero-Martin1, Y Su2, R Boger2, KA Metcalf Pate1 1Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; 2Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; 3School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PA; 4 a platelet nadir was observed on day 3 postinfection, followed by a rebound thrombocytosis on day 8. additional mice were infected and euthanized on days 0, 3, 8, or 21. a subset of mice was treated with platelet depleting antibody every 3 d. we hypothesized that handheld glucometers, serum chemistry, and HbA1c would have different diagnostic values among diabetic mouse strains that differ in the severity and duration of their disease. we found strong agreement between a commercially available glucometer and a commercially available clinical chemistry analyzer using submandibular blood. 96 pups were randomized to receive a dough nutritional supplement (DNS), gel nutritional supplement (GNS) or moistened pellet nutritional supplement (MNS) ad libitum from P11-P28 compared to a control group without a supplement. the proportion of pups consuming supplement was 100% for DNS, 100% for GNS, and 96% for MNS. there was significantly more weight gain in the DNS and MNS groups than in the control groups during the P25-P42 period (P 0.01). no morbidity or mortality was observed. supplementation is best applied in a strategic manner during the early postweaning period. in vivo sampling technique used to monitor neurotransmitters in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of the brain. dopamine plays a major role in motivation, arousal, emotional response, and reward-motivated behavior. crossover microdialysis studies were performed without enrichment or with enrichment. depilatory agents in combination with iodine and alcohol scrub would result in more epidermal damage, leading to an increased susceptibility to surgical site infections. we evaluated 4 different skin preparation conditions (n=15/group). nalbuphine is a potentially effective opioid analgesic for mice that is not currently classified as a controlled substance. no significant differences between alcohol and saline were observed. nalbuphine is absorbed and eliminated quickly, making it a possible candidate for acute pain management. Xenopus laevis, MS-222 remains the gold standard for anesthesia. flunixin meglumine was characterized as an analgesic option using 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg injected into the dorsal lymph sac. 5 out of 12 frogs died within 24 h despite uneventful anesthetic recoveries. etomidate and benzocaine offer alternative anesthetic options. a commercially available high-calorie dietary gel supplement was investigated as a sole food source for mice in the perioperative period. the study groups were: vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) + DG (n=8), VSG + LEN (n=8), sham surgery + DG (n=6), and sham surgery + LEN (n=6). neutrophil recruitment is associated with the pathology in several manifestations of brucellosis. in previous studies, we found neutrophils to be a major target of Brucella infection. interferon- deficiency resulted in markedly enhanced neutrophil recruitment to the joints and spleen. inducing neutrophil death is a mechanism by which interferon- could restrain neutrophilic inflammation during Brucella infection in cattle. interferon- has differential effects on the survival of bovine versus murine neutrophils. prevalence for culture was low for P. aeruginosa, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae, and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus (group B), ranging from 0-6% by agent. most OB were isolated at similar rates for both sample types, except for S. aureus. a possible cause of the healing impairment was proposed to be the preoperative dose of buprenorphine used in the surgical procedure. 40 female group-housed mice were split into 4 treatment groups, n=10. each group was anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and received 2, bilateral 4-mm full-thickness skin punch biopsies. the antibiotic cocktail of ampicillin (1g/L), vancomycin (0.5g/L), neomycin (1g/L) and metronidazole (1g/L) is frequently used. this reduced water consumption results in decreased dosage of the antibiotic cocktail. the tested palatability enhancers were not effective at masking the unpalatable taste of the antibiotic cocktail in C57BL/6J mice. future studies will examine other antibiotics that may be more palatable. MTLV belongs to the herpesvirus family. genome sequence shared 100% nucleotide identity with MTLV, described as murine roseolovirus (MRV), was deposited in GenBank. we identified 1 protein consistent with a glycoB protein found in related viruses that will be targeted as a potential antigen for anti-MTLV antibody detection. genome sequencing by NGS was accomplished in a few weeks. copies can be used to evaluate reproducibility of each NGS sequence run for consecutive testing of the same population. this internal control can be helpful for understanding of background and/or contaminating 16S rRNA sequence that may be introduced into a sample via husbandry supplies and environment. AG 129, AG B6 and A B6 strains were less susceptible to the ZIKV strain. euthanasia was performed when mice showed moribundity, paralysis, or >20% loss of initial body weight. others have shown that younger mice are more susceptible to ZIKV than older mice. the rat grimace scale (RGS) is a novel assessment tool that has been effective in identifying pain in acute somatic pain models. it has been effective in identifying pain in acute somatic pain models. it is a widespread and economically important disease in humans. the positive correlation between the DAI and RGS scores (P 0.0001) indicates that disease severity is associated with increased pain. rats are particularly prone to hypothermia during anesthesia. a short warming period of 30 min effectively maintained core body temperature during recovery from isoflurane anesthesia. a rabbit-specific supraglottic airway device (SGAD) would be faster to place, provide a larger cross-sectional airway area. fifteen adult rabbits were randomized to receive SGAD or ET for general anesthesia. each device type was placed by a single investigator. a CT scan of the head and neck was performed following premedication. cynomolgus macaques were assigned to study, fasted for 13 h, and had blood collected for serum chemistry while manually restrained. all animals had additional blood collections at 30, 60, and 120 min after the first sample. a small food treat administered after blood collection would influence clinical chemistry values. the glucose decrease often occurred earlier for control animals compared to animals given a food treat. however, the results suggest that providing a small food treat to cynomolgus monkeys has no clear impact on most routine clinical chemistry parameters within 2 h. aflibercept, ranibizumab, or normal saline were injected intravitreally at 8 wk post-DL-AAA following randomization of eyes to treatment on basis of week 8 leakage. the area and fluorescence intensity of retinal vascular leakage were quantified from the 1 and 3 min angiograms. aflibercept and ranibizumab treatments attenuated the area and fluorescence intensity of retinal vascular leakage, starting from 1 wk, peaking around 4 wk. treatment resulted in a 75% reduction in average leakage area in 3 min angiograms. but a complete inhibition of leakage was only observed at the 1-min angiogram interval in eyes treated with aflibercept. total intravenous anesthesia with alphaxalone would alter functional connectivity in the adult rhesus macaque brain (n=4, 9-13-y-old) compared to isoflurane inhalant anesthesia using a default-mode network (DMN) rsfMRI data were acquired using a multiband EPI sequence. alfaxalone suppresses neural activity more dramatically than isoflurane anesthesia in animal studies in a dose-dependent manner. this suggests such dose-dependent effects should be considered when choosing anesthetic protocols that examine neuronal function in neuroimaging. zebra finches have been used as models for research into song learning and transgenic finches. somal DNA sequencing was performed on 6 colony isolates from 2010. all 12 isolates tested were negative for gamma glutamyl transferase, but 11 were hippurate and esterase positive, 3 were urease positive, and 4 had the ability to produce hydrogen sulfide. finches were video recorded for 5 min pre and postinjection. if CAM was not achieved by 300 s postinjection, finches were euthanized with CO2. ethanol substantiated more negative behavioral outcomes. mice treated only with an NSAID had significantly higher MGS for 24 h following surgery compared to all other groups. a multimodal analgesic approach can provide greater pain relief than carprofen alone during postsurgical recovery. Isoflurane (ISO) is the most commonly used method of general inhalational anesthesia for mice in biomedical research. however, a wide range of recommendations from institutions and IACUC guidelines suggest various induction concentrations at 3%, 4%, and 5%. higher induction rate was tolerated among the four strains with the exception of the NSG male mice. in general, lower induction rate at 3% ISO is better tolerated in mice. three to 4-wk-old C57BL/6NCrl mice are often observed to have lower oocyte and zygote yields compared to published results for other C57BL/6 substrains. all mice receive either 5 or 7.5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) by IP injection followed 47 h later by 5 or 7.5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) IP. females that were mated with singly housed (76%) males compared to males in duplex housing (62%). shipping stress was the variable that negatively affected our superovulation yields the most. the mice were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups (saphenous venipuncture, submandibular bleeding, control) of 15 mice/strain. the mice were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups (saphenous venipuncture, submandibular bleeding, control) clusterin is a multifunctional heterodimeric glycoprotein that was first identified as a component of the fluid from the ram rete testes. it has been suggested clusterin may be involved in a variety of functions like cell-cell interactions, sperm maturation, and cell survival and apoptosis. most E.coli strains are commensal but some carry virulence factors. some commensal and pathogenic pks+ and cnf+ E.colistrains have been associated with inflammation and cancer in humans and animals. pks+ and cnf1+ E.coli strains mainly belonged to phylogenetic group B2 including B21. colibactin and CNF-encoding E. colicolonize laboratory macaques. method 1 required 5 small fragments (enough to trocar 5 mice) be cryopreserved. method 2 required 1 larger fragment (also enough to trocar 5 mice) be cryopreserved. each model was thawed, minced, and then engrafted into 40 mice. y C57BL/6 background mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental olfactory conditions. each mouse was placed in a clean cage with their randomly assigned cotton square located out of reach. video recording began with the placement of the cotton square, included 2 min before CO2 was added at a 20% displacement rate. intratracheal (IT) and intranasal (IN) instillation may be effective routes to deliver test agents to the airway (lungs) or the mucosal immune system (sinuses) in ferrets. group 1 received 0.3 mL of test agent IN (administered slowly during animal inspiration) and was kept laterally recumbent to ensure the dose reached the mucosal immune system. the superbug Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can be found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines of humans. it is a leading contender for bacterial pneumonia and other bacterial infections such as blood, kidney, and urinary tract in the clinical setting. using a 22G straight gavage feeding needle was the best when performing the procedure. we followed this colonization on each mouse pup by performing qPCR on the feces at least once a week to show that K. pneumoniae can persist in the neonatal intestine for up to 3 wk after birth. with this animal model, we can now begin a broader range of intestinal infection research on K. pneumoniae. IPC-366 (canine inflammatory mammary cancer cell line) and SUM149 (inflammatory breast cancer cell line) were tested. mice received SQ flutamide or letrozole 3 times a week for 2 wk. we conclude that IPC-366 and SUM149 treated with flutamide significantly reduced tumors but letrozole does not, probably because estrogen levels are consumed by the tumor for maintenance. antiandrogen drugs could be effective treatment for canine and human IBC. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are prolific breeders in captivity and in the wild. the most common contraceptive methods are hormonal control in female macaques and vasectomies in males. zinc gluconate is a nonsurgical alternative to male contraception. complete blood counts, serum biochemistry analyses, testosterone levels, and testicular widths were evaluated at the time of injection. either 1 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo, or 3 mo post injection showed no notable changes. spermatogenesis was present in 22 of the 24 testes. the left lateral transthoracic parasternal and apical views were performed on 6 sheep (Ovis aries) at baseline preinjury, then at 24 and 48 h postinjury. the LV diastolic and systolic diameters and volumes were recorded. total RNA was extracted from fetal thymuses at day 89, 97, and 190 of gestation. total RNA was extracted from fetal thymuses at day 89, 97, and 190 of gestation. persistent BVDV infection may initiate fetal adaptive immune responses. psoriasis is a debilitating skin disease affecting approximately 23% of human population. psoriasis is a debilitating skin disease affecting approximately 23% of human population. gene-wide association studies have identified more than 40 susceptibility loci. the gene targeting constructs electroporated into ES cells. positive clones were microinjected into blastocysts and implanted into 10-15 pseudo-pregnant females. the gene targeted positive clones were successfully electroporated. blood glucose concentrations were measured over 3 h postdextrose administration. a single dose meloxicam was administered prior to surgery and isoflurane was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. mice were infected intravaginally with 20uL of 3.0x105 IFU of C. muridarum. 20 of the detectable 28 cytokines in the vaginal lavage were significantly elevated 2 days postinfection. by 10 d postinfection the inflammation in the vagina is resolving with only 4/28 significantly elevated cytokines (IP-10, MIP1a, MIC, and IFNg) by 10 d postinfection the inflammation in the vagina is resolving with only 4/28 significantly elevated cytokines. chloride (FeCl3) and a template bleeding time (T-BT) model were selected for development in NHPs for evaluating antithrombotic efficacy and bleeding liability. AV-shunt NHPs underwent sequential dose administration using a 4 shunt paradigm/NHP. a dual capability platform combining FeCl3 and T-BT models enabled simultaneous antithrombotic efficacy and derisking in the same NHP promoting a reduction in animal use. the need to monitor exact drug balances is critical for proper documentation of controlled drugs. standard 1 mL syringes had a measured hub volume of 0.066-0.068 mL. however, this estimation may not be accurate due to other variables. additional sources of variability such as the accuracy of starting volume, impact of air bubbles, and internal vial pressure also seemed to contribute to fluctuations in volume loss. male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 6 different treatment groups. castration or anesthesia only and treatment with saline, regular meloxicam, or sustained-release (SR) meloxicam. all 3 treatment groups had an increase orbital tightening, increase wound licking, decrease rearing, and decrease marble burying 1 h postop. 18 adult female Swiss-Webster mice were immunized with ovalbumin. their responses were measured over a 12-wk period. the negative control did not receive EE, and the positive control received only nesting material. rats were allowed ad libitum access to either high fat (HF-1; 60% kcal from fat) or control (CON; 13% kcal from fat) diet for a period of 30 wk. a third cohort was started on the same high fat diet (HF-2) at 8 wk of age for a period of 22 wk. the rats are nondiabetic despite a significant degree of obesity. this diet-induced obesity model may have utility for testing novel anti-obesity compounds to assess how gender specific hormonal differences may influence weight loss/gain outcomes. the sand technique is considered an acceptable alternative for urine collection on toxicology studies for urinalysis. mice urine collected via metabolic cages was analyzed for urine chemistry parameters before and after contact with the sand. mutant rats were crossed with wild-type (WT) SD rats and 100% of the pups obtained showed no tremors. tremors appear by week 3 and decrease gradually after week 16. a new spontaneous mutation in the rat is a potential new model for studying myelination process. mouse model of RLN injury hypothesized that administration of buprenorphine-SR (b-SR) would reduce efficacy of intraoperative ES. sixteen C57BL/6J mice of either sex, divided into 3 groups, underwent a surgical compression injury of the right RLN. selection of preoperative and perioperative anesthesia and analgesia may have an effect on functional outcomes after ES treatment. tracking software will give further insight to VF recovery after injury as it has the potential to detect the synchrony and percentage of displacement between the right (impaired) and left (normal) VFs. lungs were collected for either immunophenotyping or histopathological analyses. pregnant, uninfected animals had greater fixed lung volume, total lung capacity, residual volume, and lung compliance compared with nonpregnant, uninfected females. transgenic animal models are necessary resources for the study of gene function and disease. pronuclear microinjection is the preferred method for generating these lines. this results in the random integration of foreign transgenic DNA into the genome. this can lead to the disruption or alteration of gene function. minipig skin has been reported to be similar to human skin. however, there is a wide variance in skin morphology reported for domestic pigs. a map for prospective sample collection was created with 17 separate sites. othelial Integrity in Mice Housed in Static Microisolator Cages M Eichner*, J Purcell, JD Fortman Biologic Resources Laboratory, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL. no defined guidelines exist for laboratory rodents. the persistence of myofibroblasts in the stroma heavily contributes to corneal fibrosis. the persistence of myofibroblasts in the stroma contributes to corneal fibrosis. stromal fibroblasts (HSF) were isolated from donor human corneas. is was created in vivo in 12 new Zealand White rabbits by a 30 sec topical application of 1 N NaOH. a single topical application of PEI-NP can be delivered through a single topical application of PEI-NP to safely and effectively attenuate corneal fibrosis. a variety of analgesic SR formulations are already used in lab animal medicine. there are currently no studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of an SR NSAID in sheep. a single dose SRM would provide 72 h of stable plasma levels equivalent to CM. one animal experienced transient acute renal azotemia at 24 h after SRM administration that improved by 120 h. no other significant clinical findings were noted, considering that acute renal azotemia was observed in the sheep with the highest SRM plasma levels. genipin began crosslinking the tissue by the 5-min time point and gold nanoparticles successfully attached to the carotid tissue in 30 min. the results show the genipin began crosslinking the tissue by the 5-min time point and with no greater cytotoxic effects. type II fibers (IIa, IIb, and IIx) are fast glycolytic fibers that produce high force and fast contraction. results revealed no significant change in the proportion of type I muscle fibers in SMARD1 gastrocnemius muscle compared to control. the proportion of Type IIa fibers was mildly affected in SMARD1 muscle fibers compared to control. fenbendazole (FBZ) is widely used to treat and prevent gastrointestinal parasites in dogs used in biomedical research. the influence of FBZ on the resident GM is unknown. fecal samples were collected from dogs that were housed in 3 different facilities. positron emission tomography is most often used for anatomical purposes. positron emission tomography allows functional assessment of tumors. small animal models are commonly used to gather data prior to human clinical trials. fecal microbiota of commercial mink is a representative carnivore. n=366 was collected from weaned kits and adult females in the summers of 2014 and 2015, and from adult females in the winter of 2016. n=366 was collected from weaned kits and adult females in the summers of 2014 and 2015. oTUs were seen in 2014 than 2015 or 2016 (P 0.05), 2014 was richer than 2016 (P = 0.013) and 2014 was more even but less diverse than 2015 (P 0.01). there were significant differences in community membership and structure by year and season for adult females (all P values 0.001). zygotes were transferred to fresh KSOM/aa media and cultured for 5 d. we used 5 doses of lipofection RNP complexes: original concentration (= 1x) and 2, 3, 4, and 5 higher concentrations of the original. microbiota composition plays a role in several diseases pathogenesis and drug discovery, including inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes, and autism. we hypothesize that the gut microbiome diversity in C57BL/6 mice acquired from within the same barrier may vary by age and gender. fecal microbiota transplantation in germ-free mice is a common approach in microbiome research and drug testing. diets with altered fat content or fat/protein sources (soybean oil versus milk fat or soy protein versus casein) would improve human microbiota establishment. mice were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V3 region. gene markers for lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and pro and antiinflammatory cytokines were measured in ileum and colon by qPCR. animal-sourced diet increased colonization efficiency of mouse microbiota-colonized mice significantly. a new microsampler was optimized for routine serosurveillance of nonhuman primate colonies. the absorptive tip of the device consists of inert, porous, hydrophilic material that wicks up a consistent volume (20L) of whole blood. it reduces animal stress due to shorter restraint times, anesthesia, and technician handling. cloning method requires refinement in establishment of nuclear transfer embryonic stem cell (ntES) and production of interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) fibroblast cells were created from tail tissues of the large field mouse. the cloned embryos were immunostained with 50nM trichostatin A (TSA) for 8 h. the cloned embryos were immunostained with 50nM trichostatin A (TSA) for 8 h followed by 10g/mL vitamin C (VC) for 7 h. a thoracotomy was performed, with subsequent myocardial infarction, in the surgical group (Sx) and twice daily subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) was provided for 72 h (n=27) nonsurgical groups (NS) had no surgical manipulation, only intubation/anesthesia. the Ivy method is a quantitative coagulation assay based on a standardized skin wound. the blood pressure cuff is wrapped on the upper arm and inflated to 70 mm Hg. a standard-sized cut wound is created on the forearm skin and the bleeding time is recorded. the modified Ivy method is a reliable method to assess drug efficacy in monkey. the R2G2 mouse model is ultra immunodeficient but provides a model that is less leaky and more tolerant to gamma radiation than traditional SCID models. cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) closely resembles humans. it is advantageous to use experimental nonhuman primate for human medical research because their circulation system is complicated and show many similarities to the human mechanism of circulation. cynomolgus monkey can be used as a model of human heart disease. this is the first report that demonstrates the analysis of arterial blood and heart disease in nonhuman primate. this data may facilitate human research and help in the management of nonhuman primates. cohoused mice were seropositive for mouse adenovirus-2 (40%), mouse hepatitis Virus (80%), murine norovirus (70%), pneumonia virus of mice (30%) and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (80%) cohoused mice were also seropositive for Encephalitozoon cuniculi (10%) and Mycoplasma pulmonis (20%). celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, is well-known to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. a number of studies show that visualization techniques by fluorescent probes can identify correctly, quickly, and efficiently. a number of studies show that visualization techniques by fluorescent probes can identify correctly, quickly, and efficiently. animal necropsy and bone preparation to obtain accurate measurements with calipers is time consuming and difficult. technicians must disarticulate the lower leg and completely strip the soft tissues from the tibia, essentially creating a bone ready for histological preparation. caliper method creates a paper record that is prone to more typographical errors. X-ray measures for tibia length can be done in vivo or ex vivo depending on study needs. differences in gut microbiota (GM) can modulate phenotypes of models of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. groups using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant changes when comparing bedding and water decontamination methods. no significant effects were noted in the fecal GM data. findings highlight complexity by which environmental factors interact to modulate GM. GM richness was defined as the number of OTUs detected via sequencing. they were also contaminated with the highest number of pathogens. five wild mice were found to be Cryptosporidium-free and thus did not require the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. PRT can prepare animals for studies by acclimating them to slings/chairs, training them to walk on to a scale or into a crate/kennel and present limbs for injections or voluntary blood collections. using well-trained, physiologically stable animals minimizes unwanted research variability and enhances reproducibility of research results. pigs are born looking for olfactory stimulation when they are born. they are deprived of their most essential and basic needs as a species. most are built as ultra-clean, smooth-surfaced spaces, devoid of any olfactory stimulation or opportunity for such. an ongoing supply drive was initiated within the university\u2019s research community to collect donations for the creation of species-specific enrichment items. items are sterilized in an autoclave or sanitized with 10% bleach before being distributed to the specific species. a large group of RAR as well as research staff participate on the committee. environment was designed to fit inside a biological safety cabinet. it incorporated multiple levels for climbing and jumping, substrates for digging and burrowing, loose toys for chewing and playing, and a dust bath. animals were released into the environment daily for 20-30 m. perfusion was done with 5l of 0.9% NaCl containing 10.000 IE of heparin. the blood, later saline, and PFA were collected directly through the venous cannula. the cadaver was left untouched for 1 h to allow further fixation. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were well fixed. the technique provides proper tissue fixation of the head but also in a controlled manner with relatively small volumes of perfusate. the categorization was found to be similar for both species as the majority of the cost associated with labor. the analysis demonstrates the benefit of performing species-specific cost analysis in determining per diem rates for animal care. animal programs are expected to have documented plans that address natural, manmade, or technological disruptions. however, less attention is typically directed at managing the seemingly less significant events, such as interrupted internet, e-mail systems, malfunctioning software and supply and equipment shortages. mother-reared infants less likely to develop abnormal behaviors in rhesus macaques. rare infants are surrogate/peer-reared if rejected or if the mother is determined to be unfit (medically or behaviorally) by the attending veterinarian. a commercially available caloric nutritional supplement is a low-volume, high-protein, calorie-dense, soluble supplement intended for people in need of concentrated nutrition. a liquid diet was prepared in-house using commercially available ingredients, readily consumed by animals and cost-effective for our institution in feeding large, growing animals long term. rooms may be small while cages are large and difficult to maneuver. poor sanitization can lead to animal illness and pest control problems. a subpar safety environment can cause caregiver bite and scratch wounds and back and leg injuries. nonobese diabetic mice are widely used to study immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus. nonobese diabetic mice are widely used to study immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, and gut microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria have been shown to lower the incidence of diabetes. with acquired MNV infection showed a decreased incidence of diabetes (32%) at 20 wk of ages compare to both groups of MNV-free control mice (86% and 84% respectively), suggesting that MNV infection is protective against the onset of diabetes in NOD mice. median total parasitemia was lowest in female mice from vendor A at 8.6x105 parasites per mL of blood. median parasitemia was lowest in male mice from vendor A at 3.2x106 parasites per mL of blood, which represented a 60% and 53% reduction in parasitemia. males showed higher shedding rates (19 eggs/tape) than female counterparts of the same age (2 eggs/tape) though both increase around 9 and 24 weeks of age and taper off around 28 weeks. ova remained viable up to 27 w at room temperature (49% hatch rate), which makes the need for effective environmental decontamination even more vital. mouse parvovirus (MPV) is transmitted by fecal-oral and fomite routes. as such, we hypothesize that MNV-spiked feed would contain viable virus and cause seroconversion when fed to mice. experiments were repeated after contaminating powdered feed with increasing doses of MNV. soiled bedding sentinels have long been used for the detection of infectious agents in rodent vivariums. individually ventilated cage (IVC) racks that lack cage-level filtration allow the user to screen exhaust air dust (EAD) via PCR. nine agents, including Entamoeba, Helicobacter, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, murine norovirus, P. pneumotropica, Spironucleus muris, and Tritrichomonas, were detected in 17 of 24 racks in 11 rooms. the concordance between detection methods for all agents was 18.9% for bedding sentinels, 77.2% for fecal pools, 83.4% for EAD plenum sw characterized pathogen of immunocompromised mice causing a hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic skin disease primarily in nude mice. affected mice had a hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic dermatitis with colonies of small Gram-positive coccobacilli in the keratin scale. infected nude mice had moderately thickened erythemic skin with minimal keratin scale production. infected NOG mice were dehydrated with unkempt hair coats, thickened skin, and moderate keratin scale production. none of the inoculated ICR mice were colonized or developed hyperplastic dermatitis. 57BL/6J has been reported to have insulin-resistant features. the aim was to determine the effect of the C57B background on the diabetic phenotype and associated metabolic parameters in C57B/hA mice. ling Device and the 3Rs: a new and better microsampler for Routine Serosurveillance of rodent colonies. multiplexed fluorometric immunoassays require a much smaller volume of serum. a new microsampler was optimized for routine serosurveillance of rodent colonies. adenovirus (MAV-1 and 2), rotavirus, norovirus (MNV), and picornavirus (GD7 and RTV) sensitivity and specificity for tip eluates and serum were found to be 99% and 100% (no false positives detected), respectively. perianal tape test, fecal floatation, examination of intestinal contents may vary in efficacy for different endoparasite due to differences in tissue tropisms and life cycles. oligonucleotide primer set could successfully amplify regions of the 18S rRNA gene of Spironucleus muris and Tritrichomonas muris. mouse colonies with stable, complex GM profiles can be used as donors for a variety of GM transfer techniques including rederivation, cohousing, cross-fostering, and fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) mice were surgically transferred into CD1 or C57BL/6 surrogate dams that varied by GM composition. breeding colonies of CD1 mice with distinct GM profiles were maintained for 9 generations. to confirm GM stability, we shipped offspring to collaborating institutions. we compared changes in disease phenotype using the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. SEBLAB was registered with the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) in 2008 enabling work with select agents and toxins to be performed in the facility. all labs registered for work with select agents are required to conduct drills or exercises to evaluate their security, biosafety, and incident response plans. a metabolism cage for dual housing of dogs was designed to improve welfare for dogs. it was designed to demonstrate the suitability of conducting excretion balance studies with a pair housing design to improve welfare without compromising the scientific integrity of the study. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) trained to enter a holding cage. using a verbal cue, we had to manually restrain 86% of the animals. this was effective, but not yielding a high enough rate of success by the eighth day of training. temperament testing paradigms have been used in shelter and pet dog medicine for several years. there is no peer-reviewed published temperament test specific for laboratory dogs. nomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) implanted with ambulatory infusion pumps in backpacks are generally housed singly during continues infusion studies (24h 4 w) because of the perceived risk of cage mates manipulating infusion pumps in backpacks leading to damage of the reservoir containing the test substance. a 4-w regulatory continuous infusion study has been conducted in freely moving group-housed NHPs. continuous iv-infusion studies with VAPs over at least 28 d in free-ranging mature cynomolgus monkeys can be conducted under group-housing conditions without manipulation on backpacks among cage mates. this method facilitates an overall reduction in animal stress by minimizing potential for catheter and iatrogenic related complications. a reduction in the number of NHPs required for urodynamic research studies is also possible since a male NHP can be effectively reused. ten years ago, we initiated the first of what would become our annual Rodent Refresher presentation to help everyone stay current with modern expectations. the hour-long sessions are offered 9 times a year, on various days and times of the week, and in various on campus locations, in an effort to be accommodating. a carefully thought out and well-written protocol is essential to receiving a constructive, timely, and accurate review. the clarity of the protocol is a powerful tool for the research team to understand and adhere to. the topics include a discussion of challenging protocol components such as a workable project timeline, rigid drug dosing schedules, and possible postoperative monitoring pitfalls. institutional research administration offices undertook internal review of project applications procedures, protocol review methods, data storage and sharing, and reporting processes. the enhanced ability to process, report, and share important information has improved regulatory compliance; reduced the administrative burden of investigators, reviewers, and administrative staff. gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital malformations in humans. the distal esophagus and distal ileum are the most common sites of occurrence. this condition presents an additional differential diagnosis in cases where an animal presents with signs of obstruction or constipation. cytology, gross necropsy, lung tissue culture, and histopathology (head, trachea, and lungs) no pathogenic organisms were found in nasal passages, trachea, or lungs. most likely diagnosis is asthma or allergic reaction to an unknown allergen. disease was suspected due to edema and ascites, anemia, and hypoproteinemia. but the following day urinalysis was performed and results were within normal range. the owl monkey\u2019s condition remained unchanged and the decision was made to euthanize due to poor prognosis. experimental infections, was examined for epistaxis and respiratory difficulty. differentials for lymphadenopathy included bacterial infection or sepsis, fungal infection, lymphoma, and fibromatosis. no significant pathogens were cultured from the tonsils, gastric fluid, or transtracheal wash fluid. rhesus macaque is the first reported case of spontaneous lymphoma in a young adult. the animal had been housed in the facility for 1 mo as part of a retinoblastoma study. the animal was found dead the following day. a 3-y-old, captive-reared, female, Indian-origin rhesus macaque presented for preassignment physical examination. the patient had a history of mild splenomegaly and lymphadenomegaly. a firm, immobile subcutaneous mass was palpated in the left inguinal region. uterine inguinal herniation is a rare condition most often seen in infant humans. it can present in sub-adult macaques without any associated clinical signs and minimal observable abnormalities. uterine inguinal herniation should be considered as a differential diagnosis. tumors were disseminated throughout the esophagus, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, intestines, stomach, spleen, dermis, brain, muscle, and glandular tissue. no fungal organisms were identified on peripheral blood smear. inal ultrasound revealed the fetal heart rates were depressed at 90-96 beats per minute prompting an emergency caesarian section. the bitch underwent an ovariohysterectomy in the same anesthetic event. the remainder of the litter was healthy and free of congenital defects. nea immediately after sedation with alphaxalone was noted. decreased bronchovesicular sounds and muffled heart sounds were ausculted over the right thorax. the animal was euthanized due to its unstable condition. this is the first report of lung lobe torsion in an experimentally unmanipulated marmoset. this condition is rare in all mammals, but should be included in the differential diagnoses for marmosets with a history of acute dyspnea. tumor was negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and myoglobin, with scant collagen observed on Masson\u2019s trichrome staining. microchip was implanted 14 mo prior to the mass developing. one month after surgery, another mass was noted near the surgical site. a follow up sedated exam revealed marked macroblepharon causing corneal ulceration. a temporary tarsorrhaphy was performed to assist with corneal ulcer healing. at that time, the right eye was negative for fluorescein uptake, but had significant corneal edema and neovascularization. a single dose of 37.5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CPA) resulted in transient immunosuppression. a 2y-old, 60 kg female sheep received 3 IV doses of 37 mg/kg of CPA at d 0, d 13 and d 20. histology revealed an eosinophilic inflammation in spleen, lung, lymph node and large intestine. repeated dosing of CPA was able to induce prolonged immunosuppression. 1/197 pharyngeal cultures (0.5%) were positive for K. pneumoniae. diarrhea was the most frequently occurring sign. at least 6 animals were negative for K. pneumoniae on repeat rectal cultures. female C57BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) were treated with the following agents prior to ventral laparotomy: 0.9% saline (control), 70% ethanol (EtOH), 10% povidone iodine or 2% chlorhexidine gluconate alternated with saline or 70% EtOH, commerical surgical scrub A, commerical surgical scrub B, and a common commercial hand sanitizier. the animal showed nonweight bearing lameness on the left hind leg. it had moderate swelling and erythema at the hock. radiographs revealed a closed comminuted tibiofibular fracture 0.2 cm proximal to the hock. tibiofibular fractures in common marmosets can be treated by splinting of the affected limb, weekly bandage changes, and pain management. this case illustrates that closed, comminuted limb fractures in common marmosets are at risk for limb fracture. the outbreak resulted in the euthanasia of over 2,000 mice and a shutdown and decontamination of the barrier suite. DNA from healthy and clinically affected mice was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene subjected to shotgun metagenomics sequencing in an attempt to identify the putative culprit bacteria. aneous Animal Model of Human Primary Acute Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (PAACS), occurring as a complication in a 5-mo-old hybrid Yorkshire-Landrace pig subjected to splenectomy. ACS and intraabdominal hypertension have been recognized as life-threatening complications, resulting from serious deleterious effects. a spontaneous form of ACS can further complement critical-current research related to this life-threatening condition never reported before to our knowledge. a spontaneous form of ACS can further complement critical-current research related to this life-threatening condition. spleens had loss of white pulp, extramedullary hematopoiesis and moderate to severe myeloid proliferation. Klebsiella oxytoca, a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium, has been previously reported as an opportunistic pathogen. this case series presents the first reports of abscesses associated with K. oxytoca in laboratory rodents, specifically NSG mice. the first reports of osteomyelitis of the appendicular skeleton and spine associated with K. oxytoca in laboratory rodents. tracheal tissues maintained robust blood supply and confirmed clinical impression that the trachea can be successfully transplanted and maintained heterotopically. trachea is extensively used in aging research due to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans. missing/cannibalized (12%), suspected hernias (12%), eye defects (12%), and bite wounds (11%) were the major reasons for removing 114 males between these ages. less than 0.5% of females were removed between 25-52 weeks of age on an average week. butorphanol (2.48 mg/ml), azaperone (0.83 mg/ml) and medetomidine (0.99 mg/ml) (BAM), developed for the immobilization of wildlife as an alternative to ultrapotent opioids. the potential benefits of BAM include anesthesia and analgesia in a single, low-volume injection with agent reversibility. 83%) reached established experimental endpoints for bradycardia or MAP regardless of dose. the use of BAM for the immobilization of rhesus macaques may have limited utility. administration was reversed at 1 h (499.5 255.3 g, p=0.66), 12 h (563.1, 243.3 g, p=0.96), 24 h (402.2 277.4 g, p=0.02) post sustained-release meloxicam administration. results show that the Randall-Selitto test is a useful method to measure pain response in New Zealand White rabbits. genome was extracted using a commercial microbiome kit. rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced using 250 reads. a multiyear period MT Lieberman*1, D Van Tyne2, J Dzink-Fox1, MS Gilmore2, JG Fox1 1Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. the goal of this study was to serially sample CRC exudate over time and compare antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence factor genes, and biofilm formation, as well as identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in EF MIC testing revealed a decrease in tetracycline resistance and slight increase in gentamicin resistance for both ST 4 and ST 55 isolates. the bacitracin MIC decreased for the ST 4 isolate, while the erythromycin MIC norminally increased. patients with the T300A ATG16L1 risk allele exhibit aberrant ileal and colonic histologic morphology. ileal and colonic tissues were dissected from age-matched 3-w- and 6-w-old wild type and heterozygous rats and fixed in formalin. clb-encoding E. coli isolates have not been described in these animals. pks+E. coli strains are not excluded from rodents housed under specific-pathogen free conditions in academic or vendor facilities. clb-encoding E.coli colonizes laboratory rats from multiple commercial vendor and academic institution facilities. this suggests the potential of these organisms to contribute to clinical disease and introduce confounding variables into experimental rat models. all Interceptor tests came back positive for Helicobacter spp. and P. pneumotropica. only 67% and 4% of the trolleys had one or more positive sentinels for Helicobacter spp. and P. pneumotropica. the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) was found to be highly overexpressed in IBD serving as a hub gene linking over 12 known IBD biomarkers. we have extended this finding by quantifying the enzymatic activity of GCPII in 32 surgical intestinal biopsies from 20 subjects. mice were administered carprofen MediGel or injectable carprofen. plasma concentrations of the drug were compared at various time points. this indicates that carprofen MediGels provide more consistent blood levels of the analgesic throughout a given treatment period. mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (90/11.25 mg/kg) and underwent either VNS (10 SOD1; 8 WT) or sham (10 SOD1; 9 WT) surgery. a ventral neck incision was made to access the cervical vagus nerve, which was gently isolated and placed on bipolar electrodes for 1 h. all but one mouse survived the procedure. NS surgery performed in this study, whose breathing became slow and irregular during recovery. two mice (1 WT; 1 SOD1) received only 44 min of VNS due to respiratory difficulties. microbiota characterization of fecal samples is underway. studies in other NHP species suggest chronic exposure to social stressors interferes with the transplacental transfer of IgG via its receptor. subjects included 30 high- and 30 low-ranking adult female rhesus macaques near 5 or 10 y post initial immunization (pi) metrics have demonstrated the measureable success of major programmatic changes. one goal was to increase protocol review efficiency by implementing pre-review. a decrease in the committee\u2019s decision to withhold approval followed by an increase in protocol approval during full committee review. model-specific questions are now used for tumor, diabetes, traumatic brain injury, behavior, and many other studies. the use of model-driven protocol forms allows assessment of models as a whole instead of as separate procedures, improving animal welfare assessments of protocols. the fish are the second most used species for research in the uk. they undergo mostly minor and rapid surgical procedures like fin clipping and tag implantation. the veterinarian spends some time with the users in their usual set-up. the intracoelomic administration adds about 1 m to the surgical time. the intracoelomic administration only adds about 1 m to the surgical time. a team approach involving veterinarian, researchers, and animal care staff was necessary. the mouse science class final includes a live clinical exam. the classes serve as a prerequisite for the college-level genetics I and II. technicians must pass with a 70% before moving on to the next class. environmental samples can be used to detect aquatic pathogens. the water was swabbed on 10 cm at the interface between the surface and the sump wall. this was productive for the PCR identification of Mycobacterium spp and Aeromonas hydrophila. environmental samples can be cost effective to determine the health status of the aquatic facilities. the ability to test sumps rather than tanks is valuable to reduce screening expenses. the other advantage is the non-sacrifice of fish. the IT office agreed to finance the operation and then challenged us to think beyond the possible. our staff came pretrained in the use of these devices so putting one of our devices in their hand seemed natural. we decided to modify what we were doing to take advantage of preexisting technologies. a shift away from sterilization toward reversible methods appears to have contributed to increases in unintended pregnancies in countries with limited resources. guinea pigs are a favorable model because they display an estrous cycle with a prolonged luteal phase, similar to primates. first pilot data suggests agents validated in NHPs promote similar lesions in the guinea pig. this model is a promising refinement for future studies to reduce NHP use while furthering contraceptive development for women. a cage change frequency of three weeks does not negatively impact mice in our vivarium. a cage change frequency of three weeks does not negatively impact mice in our vivarium. more than a dozen of nearly 400 protocols that include mouse breeding met the criteria for poor breeding. the university completed its transition from trio to pair breeding as the default breeding scheme. the first phase focused on clinical case management between husbandry, veterinary, and lab staff. the app was designed to monitor indicators of noncompliance or equipment failures. the initial capital expenditure of the project was negligible as compared to the expected annual savings of $112,000. cages remained germ free for 12 wk with the use of IVCs, irradiated bedding supplies and strict aseptic protocol. we concluded that following strict aseptic technique and maintaining supplies sterile allows for the use of germ-free mice in IVCs with any microbial context. monia measuring approaches allowed us to make quantitative comparisons of tradeoffs in accuracy, reliability, and costs of different approaches. using per-cage wireless sensors was a key enabler of performance-based approaches because of their 2 to 3 h measurement interval, and low labor effort compared to traditional gas detectors and paper strips. new HM program increased effectiveness and comprehensiveness of infectious agent detection by increasing the number of pathogens screened each quarter. the amended program also increased application of the 3Rs by decreasing the number of sentinels required for serological assessment and eliminated live body shipping. MRI imaging of the tag in rat tails shows no obstruction even proximal to the tag. MRI imaging of the tag in rat tails shows no obstruction even proximal to the tag. this technology will enable cost-effective automated data capture of the animal identity. the animal care and veterinary staff received hands-on training on techniques for applying topical ivermectin and selamectin by pipette and spray bottle. the process for triaging and reporting health concerns was provided. the use of a portable chlorine dioxide gas generator to sterilize equipment in our facilities has proven effective. the chamber, at the largest size, is approximately 300 cubic feet and uses considerably less consumable product than a small animal room that measures 1200 cubic feet. similar chambers could have applications beyond chlorine dioxide gas to other methods of sterilization/decontamination. a conflict/reward assay can effectively evaluate the affective component of a pain response by allowing the animal to modify its behavior based on the perceived level of pain. animals received standard doses buprenorphine injected subcutaneously at 1, 4, 8, and 12 h post administration. a standard dose of buprenorphine is effective at providing analgesia for both male and female rats. clinical duration of action differed between male and female rats with perceived analgesic effect lasting at least 12 h in females but only at least 4 h and less than 8 h in male rats. buprenorphine-castrated, 0.04mg/kg buprenorphine-uncastrated, saline-castrated, or sham (n=15 piglets/treatment group) injections were given IM 20 min prior to surgical castration. meloxicam, a COX-2 selective NSAID, is commercially available in an injectable form and as a medicated diet for administration in mice. there is a wide range of accepted doses for meloxicam with a recent survey showing many diplomates recommend a dose of 2 mg/kg/d. the HT data showed no evidence of pain alleviation in either the MD or MI groups. the trend suggested allodynia in both the sham and no analgesia control groups. ossification of the distal tail tip occurs between 17 and 28 days of age. activity was video recorded preprocedure and for 60 m post-procedure. other groups have published aberrations in mouse physiology and motor activity. the videos were viewed by a panel of reviewers blinded to the treatment scenarios. 96 mice were assessed at baseline, anesthesia-analgesia and laparotomy surgery conditions by body weight, nesting consolidation and grooming transfer. the tests could be performed cage-side and were reliable across strain, sex, and housing conditions variations. phine resulted in significant body weight loss even in the absence of surgery. multimodal treatment provided the most efficacious analgesic coverage. findings can be used in refining detection and treatment of postoperative pain in mice. in adult rats (PN49 to PN115), RNP animals showed mechanical hypersensitivity (P 0.01) and thermal hypersensitivity (P 0.01) over time compared to controls. injured animals showed increased time spent on the open arms (P0.01) on elevated plus maze. septic shock predicted mortality with 97% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and a Youden\u2019s index of 0.89. the use of this cutoff (30\u00b0C at 24 hours) can significantly reduce animal suffering during survival experiments in this model of septic shock. socially dominant and subordinate adult female cynomolgus monkeys (n=42) were used to study effects of social stress on body composition and carbohydrate metabolism. monkeys were randomly assigned social groups and started on a Western diet. guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals recommends a 10-30% volume displacement per minute for carbon dioxide euthanasia of rodents. the study sought to evaluate behavior during euthanasia, determine the total time mice were exposed to potentially painful concentrations of CO2. Behavioral observations included ataxia, dyspnea, time to recumbency, time to surgical plane of anesthesia, and the number of jumps or paws at the face. the dam belonged to a colony of X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) dogs of unknown canine herpesvirus status. this 6-year-old dam, an XLMTM carrier (unaffected phenotype) was bred to male dogs from the same colony via live coverage. the deaths were viral infection or failure of passive transfer with secondary infection. follow-up serology from dogs in the XLMTM colony and the CXMD females was positive for CHV, along with PCR from tissue of several puppies. the skin and kidney lesions are suggestive of a mild form of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) PDNS more commonly causes severe illness characterized by fatal renal failure. static trio and pair cages had average ammonia levels of 74 and 38 ppm. seven days after cage change, ammonia levels rose to an average of 100 ppm and 64 ppm in static trio and pair cages. ventilation cages remained below the 25 ppm threshold reported to be potentially deleterious for mice until day 7 post cage change. a wild-caught, wild-caught, intact adult male Southern giant pouched rat was anesthetized with isoflurane for a routine annual physical exam. two 4-5cm moderately firm, bilateral, symmetrical, vermiform, subcutaneous swellings were noted in the cranial preputial region. the remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. a second urinalysis showed moderate proteinuria (3+), marked glycosuria (> 1000mg/dL), and low numbers of mixed bacteria without inflammation. anti-inflammatory treatment is being withheld to avoid exacerbation of the hyperglycemia and chronic kidney disease. frogs were housed in bleach-sanitized tanks with salt (4 g salt in 7.5L of RO water) and methylene blue (3.75 ml of stock solution) after treatment, frogs were removed from static housing and transferred to recirculation system housing into bleach sanitized tanks. treatment described above will also be used in the future for all incoming frogs after recovery from shipping. pens of adult male and female, C-strain white leghorn chickens reported to have a marked drop in egg production of over 50% the 3 mo prior to presentation. the chickens were housed in an AAALAC-accredited institution and were part of various teaching and agricultural protocols. one wk prior to presentation, a power outage occurred at the facility. the mite was positively identified as Ornithonyssus sylviarum, the most serious ectoparasite of poultry in North America. the treatment plan consisted of ivermectin in the water at 0.2mg/kg every 2 wk for 4 treatments along with biweekly topical treatment with Permethrin. testing was performed on serum to identify Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species. fecal centrifugation was performed for identification of endoparasites. several endoparasites were detected and classified to the genus level. rhesus macaque cultured both methicillin resistant S. capitis and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid. mRSA has been isolated from skin margins of cephalic implants in macaques. MIC results corroborated oxacillin-resistance for 81.3% (13/16) of methicillin-resistant isolates. mRSA, an important pathogen was isolated from both cephalic implants and nares of the research macaques. cross-fostering provided successful transfer of the standardized GM from the surrogate CD-1 dam at approximately 90% efficiency. cross-fostering is an effective means of conferring standardized complex GMs onto a mouse colony of the investigator\u2019s choosing. control cecal samples were collected by postmortem luminal content collection after 3 wk. all rats were euthanized, and cecal contents were collected. mice were involved in a prenatal diet intervention study where the dams received a control or methyl-donor diet without further experimental manipulation. other clinical signs observed included hunched posture, lethargy, dyspnea, white ocular discharge, and diarrhea. the majority of the mice affected were offspring of dams fed a methyl-donor diet, but the impact of this experimental manipulation on gut microbiota or other aspects of susceptibility is not known. eighteen of 31 cages, housing 1 to 5 mice, had affected animals, with a maximum of 3 animals affected per cage. complete necropsies were performed on 5 mice. findings included bacterial emboli within the lung, heart, kidney, and liver. hematopoietic depletion of the spleen and bone marrow. the granulomas were characterized by a necrotic core composed of cellular and karyorrhectic debris. the affected skeletal muscle was disrupted by moderate focal, acute, fibrinous, necrotizing heterophilic myositis. nematodes and Macrorhabdus ornithogaster were observed in the isthmus. the animal was part of a cohort of 24 animals in a study investigating a defective lentiviral vector vaccine for Influenza A. the vaccine was administered IM in the posterior aspect of the right hind limb approximately 1 mo prior to presentation. a 3-y-old, purpose-bred hound dog was transferred between researchers to a Dirofilaria immitis study. the dog was placed on 2.2 mg/kg carprofen and 3 mg/kg tramadol. after 2 d with no improvement, an orthopedic exam was performed. clinical signs range from acute presentation of malaise, thrombocytopenia, muscular skeletal pain, epistaxis, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, to death secondary to hemorrhage. the bacterium is transmitted by the Rhipicephalis sanguineus. mice of the 129 strain are predisposed to blepharitis and conjunctivitis. incidence increases with age and can affect 30-50% of mice greater than 20 wk. laboratory animal technologists detected transient caudoventral cervical swelling and upper airway noise under his pen. the dog was treated with enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO once daily x 1 day), then cefazolin (20 mg/kg IM BID x 1.5 days) esophageal mucosa appeared normal, but a cavernous area was encountered. the dog was recovered from anesthesia and underwent contrast radiography. images consistent with persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) fecal occult blood test was negative for abdominal endometriosis and gastric adenocarcinoma. adenocarcinomas of either ileocecolic junction or colon origin are very rare in rhesus macaques. adenocarcinomas are very rare in rhesus macaques. a rare neoplasia may not be attributed to just one disease, especially in older nonhuman primates. a 3-y-old, 62.0 kg singly housed ewe (Ovis aries) was examined for bilateral nasal discharge prior to enrollment in a pulmonary study. a complete blood count and chemistry revealed lymphopenia and hyperglobulinemia. serology for ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) was performed using a competitive ELISA with confirmation by PCR. the results were positive so the ewe was rescheduled for a terminal 2-wk study. the lungs and nasal cavity were unremarkable grossly. piglet, the small intestine, cecum, and spiral colon were diffusely dilated by yellow contents without hemorrhage or fibrin. the left renal pelvis was dilated and contained yellow mucoid fluid. differential diagnoses included colibacillosis, rotavirus, coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, parasitism (coccidiosis) the ability to empathize diminishes as frequent exposures to compromised animals and euthanasia occur. emotional distress, work errors, sick leave, and employee turnover increase. a survey was developed and distributed to all animal care workers. it is known as the cost of caring, and is caused by the connection that we experience with those we are taking care of. the effects manifest as mental, behavioral, and physical changes, such as apathy, irritability, heightened emotions, isolation, addictive behaviors, and worsened chronic health issues. the renovated vivaria was approximately 25,000 sq. ft., including 80 animal and procedure rooms. the project impacted nearly 200 employees with many having to travel to a different building and sharing animal and procedure space. leadership and management can use 3 mechanisms to help employees with behavioral problems turn into employees that work hard, contribute, and provide stability. success was measured by tracking overall attendance and cage wash productivity for a year. success leads to positive attitudes and decreased unscheduled absences. standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a mainstay of effective animal care programs. current SOPs must be accessible, routinely updated, and the SOP library must be cross-referenced, searchable, and sortable for key documents and relevant terms. for small institutions, systems are often cost prohibitive, ranging into the thousands of dollars. per diem rates are more likely to be billed to federal awards (64%) than sponsored nonfederal awards (24%) or nonsponsored, nonfederal awards (12%). the impact of the animal user group was the highest reported impact factor in the 2014 survey and the lowest factor in the 2016 survey, suggesting a budget-focused approach to setting rates in 2016. cost under recovery for mouse caging with automatic water has been >50% since 2012. cost under recovery was reported 60% of the time for mice, rats, and rabbits and 75-80% of the time for Xenopus, small pigs, medium NHPs, and dogs. the 2012 and 2016 surveys show that 11% of programs charge a higher per diem rate when the project funding source does not pay full indirect costs. not including all allowable vivarium costs in the indirect rate negotiation when possible, coupled with not establishing per diem rates based on funding source, have some institutions not recovering full indirect costs. VOIP is the first step to successful communication. the biggest drawback is being limited to connectivity of your wireless system. we now experience less breaks in communication and have no dead spots in connectivity. about 75% of IACUC members reported that managing complaints (compliance activity) and imposing sanctions on people sometimes cause tension. most activities in the 5 categories were ranked >75% of the time as always, usually, or sometimes being a challenge, burden, or source of tension. equipment is often replaced with new, just to realize the old problem of reliability persists. TPM involves holistic operating system that strengthens technical abilities, deploys disciplined management practices, and establishes the right mindsets and behaviors. team leaders are essentially working supervisors, with a portion of their responsibilities including animal care duties. the creation of the team leader positions allowed for multiple internal promotions. these 2 important transitions included an immense time investment from a training perspective, including the organization of training sessions. the bipedicle flap chronic ischemic wound model was successfully employed in our diabetic miniswines. the 8 mm ischemic wounds showed clear evidence of impaired wound healing with associated necrosis. Sprague Dawley rats (400 g) divided in 9 subgroups. anesthesia was induced with butyrophenone tranquilizer IP (3 mg/kg)/Zoletil\u00ae 50 I.M. (30 mg/kg) through laparotomy. all animals were placed on warm pads until their recovery. the rat is a suitable adhesion animal model for preclinical device evaluation. the rat has become the most prevalent large animal model for preclinical device evaluation. the high risk of adverse hemorrhagic events makes thromboprophylaxis an ongoing challenge. corynebacterium bovis is an established opportunistic bacterial pathogen and causal agent of an orthokeratotic hyperkeratotic acanthotic dermatitis in nude (nu/nu), Pkrdcscid, and SKH1-Hrhr strain. no systemic affects have been associated with C. bovis in infected mice. no systemic affects have been associated with C. bovis in infected mice. mice spontaneously develop an autoimmune disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease affecting > 1.5 million americans. the causative mutation, Faslpr, promotes survival of self-reactive lymphocytes, leading to immune proliferation, lymphadenopathy, emergence of anti-DNA antibodies. median spleen weights at 18 wk of age were 0.5509 in females (mean +/- standard deviation = 0.6279 +/- 0.3669, range = 0.1112 \u2013 2.1348; N = 146 mice) and 0.4410 in males (mean +/- standard deviation = 0.5040 +/- 0.2629; range = 0.2078 \u2013 1.5502; N = 120 mice) Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering saline or nicotine at gestation day (GD 6); received intravenous injections of sterile broth or inoculum at GD 14; were necropsied at GD 18 to collect spleen, uterus, vagina, placenta, and amniotic fluid. microbial load of placentas was lower (P0.0001) in the low-nic+MP group. in the high-nic+MP group, there was increased (P0.0001) percent positive placenta (94%) and of placentas and amniotic fluids (P0.0001), as compared to MP only placentas. exposure of male nude rats to bLAD amplifies the nighttime melatonin signal to increase tumor sensitivity to nighttime administered sorafenib (FDA-approved multikinase inhibitor) mice were randomized to 6 subgroups (n = 4/group) and maintained on a lighting regimen (L: 300 lx; D: 0 lx; lights on 0600; D: 0 lx) bLAD-amplified nocturnal circadian melatonin signal increased tumor sensitivity to sorafenib-induced regression. the nocturnal circadian melatonin signal increased tumor sensitivity to sorafenib-induced regression by enhancing a melatonin receptor-mediated suppression of the Warburg effect. nocturnal melatonin levels were high in the mid-dark phase (153.2 14.4 pg/mL) and low (1.8 0.5 pg/mL) in mid-light phase, and low throughout the 24-h period in experimental animals. dLAN inhibits the nocturnal melatonin signal, thereby increasing LA metabolism, Warburg Effect, and growth activity. fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), an optical imaging technology, can track fluorescently labeled drugs/reagents in vivo. the whole-body biodistribution, pharmacokinetics (PK) and targeting profile of a drug is important in determining preclinical pharmacology. tumor targeting was observed for both Ab and ADC. accumulation of Ab in the tumor was 11-fold higher than the ADC. study also highlights that FMT imaging addresses all three aspects of the 3Rs. 12 total adult ICR mice underwent biodistribution studies, 6 animals received RO injection and 6 received IV injection of 18F-FDG. a 30ga insulin syringe was used to administer 50-100uCi of FDG. those receiving RO were placed in commercially available restraints and left conscious during injection. those animals receiving RO injections into the right eye had 5.46, 5.43, and 5.42% of the total injected dose/gram. we conclude that while RO injection may be an effective alternative to IV in mice for some compounds, it does not replicate the results of IV injections for radiotracers."}
