{"summary": "the incidence of sepsis has been increasing over the last two decades. Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in patients in Intensive Care Units (3) and the associated burden of care incurs financial burden. promoting the recruitment of PMNs ameliorates sepsis and attenuates sepsis-related injury and infection, respectively (14,15). Folium isatidis is considered to have detoxification properties in traditional Chinese medicine. it was reported to be effective during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome flu outbreak (19) peripheral blood was collected from four 20-30-year-old female healthy volunteers between august and December 2015. blood was transferred into heparin lithium-containing tubes. whole blood was incubated with 3% dextran T-500 in the dark for 20 min. the cells were then stimulated with 0.5 g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the following antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. the chemotaxis assays were performed using transwell inserts. 10,000 cells in 100 l were loaded in the upper inserts. 600 l of IL-8 (100 ng/ml; eBioscience; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were added to the lower wells. the reaction consisted of 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 70\u00b0C for 30 sec (40 cycles) the primers of the genes were synthesized by Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) the sequences were as follows: human CXCR1, sense 5\u2032-GCAGCTCCTACTGTTGGACA-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-GGGCATAGGCGATGATCACA-3\u2032. the results were normalized to -actin as plotted as relative expression to the average of CON or DMSO, which were set as 100. the total quantity of IL-8 in the supernatant was normalized to that of total protein in the viable cell pellets. the results were normalized to -actin as plotted as relative expression to the average of CON or DMSO, which were set as 100. the cells were then incubated with either vehicle (0.01% DMSO) or increasing concentrations of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis (100, 250 and 500 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. the cells were then stimulated with 0.5 g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 4 h.
