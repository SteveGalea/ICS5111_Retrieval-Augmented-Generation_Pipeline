{"summary": "nearly 390 million infections every year worldwide, of which 96 million are symptomatic. an estimated 2.5 billion people are at risk of dengue infection. in 2014 an outbreak of dengue occurred in Japan for the first time in over 70 years. in 2014, a dengue outbreak occurred in several Asian countries. endemic circulation of DENV strains can be driven by viral lineage introduction events that eventually lead to lineage replacement. at local scales, endemic circulation of DENV strains can be driven by viral lineage introduction events that eventually lead to lineage replacement. together, these observations suggest that increasing human mobility through air-traffic networks may impact the spread of pathogens at large geographical scales. the final data set contained 1,272 DENV-1 sequences, 628 DENV-2 sequences and 302 DENV-3 sequences. in the complete sequence dataset, some countries, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Singapore, were over-represented. to reconstruct past population dynamics, we used a coalescent-based Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) method. a GTR+I+ nucleotide substitution model and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model were used. for each serotype, three independent analyses of 150 million generations were performed. 0.5 were considered as denoting a significant migration pathway, where BF > 1,000 indicates decisive statistical support, 100 BF 100 indicates strong support, 10 BF 30 indicates substantial support and 6 BF 10 indicates support [32] we next estimated the number of expected transitions among location-pairs along the phylogeny branches. st is the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t and st (k) is the number of those paths that pass through k. the liner shipping bilateral connectivity index (LSBCI) in Asia from 2008 to 2014 was obtained from unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/Index. total latitudes for each country were calculated as the latitudes of their geometric center, passenger flow represents the number of passengers on fights between each pair of countries. LSBCI represents goods transported by the sea between pairs of countries, gross domestic product (GDP) for each country in 2000 was collected from the UN Statistics Division (https://unstats.un.org) the final data set contained 1,272 DENV-1 sequences, 628 DENV-2 sequences and 302 DENV-3 sequences. in the complete sequence dataset, some countries, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Singapore, were over-represented. three independent analyses of 150 million generations were performed for each serotype. a GTR+I+ nucleotide substitution model and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model were used. values of BF > 6 and I > 0.5 were considered as denoting a significant migration pathway. BF > 1,000 indicates decisive statistical support, 100 BF 100 indicates strong support, 10 BF 30 indicates substantial support and 6 BF 10 indicates support [32]. st is the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t and st (k) is the number of those paths that pass through k. the liner shipping bilateral connectivity index (LSBCI) in Asia from 2008 to 2014 was obtained from UNCTAD. ii) absolute latitudes for each country were calculated as the latitudes of their geometric center. passenger flow represents the number of passengers on fights between each pair of countries. LSBCI represents goods transported by the sea between pairs of countries. average temperature and rainfall for each Asian country was extracted from the data set provided by WorldClim [36] the estimated evolutionary rates of the E gene of each serotype were 7.50104 (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 6.73104\u20138.28104) substitutions per site per year for DENV-1, 8.14104 (95% HPD: 7.38104\u20138.94104) s/s/y for DENV-2, and 7.96104 (95% HPD: 7.01104\u20138.89104) s/s/y for DENV-3. the size of each node corresponds to the degree centrality of the country. black points indicate countries for which no virus sequence was included in the genetic analyses. phylogeographic analysis in Fig 5 indicates several significant migration links (with BF support > 1000) for DENV-1 these are between Cambodia and Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, and Singapore and China. the size of points corresponds to the number of geographic connections. only those viral lineage movements supported with a BF > 6 are shown. estimated number of viral lineage migrations is associated with measures of centrality in the air transportation network. we summarize the average net Markov jumps (jumps to\u2014jumps from) and their 95% credible intervals. there has been an increasing frequency of DENV lineage co-occurrence in China over time, concomitant with its increasing centrality in the Asian air transportation network. 202 DENV-3 gene sequences comprised four genotypes, genotypes I and III\u2014V. the estimated evolutionary rates of the E gene of each serotype were 7.50104 (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 6.73104\u20138.28104) substitutions per site per year for DENV-1, 8.14104 (95% HPD: 7.38104\u20138.94104) s/s/y for DENV-2, and 7.96104 (95% HPD: 7.01104\u20138 the size of each node corresponds to the degree centrality of the country in the airline network. black points indicate countries for which no virus sequence was included in the genetic analyses. we found that most candidate predictors of virus spread are not significantly associated with viral spread. phylogeographic analysis in Fig 5 indicates several significant migration links (with BF support > 1000) for DENV-1 these are between Cambodia and Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, and Singapore and China. the size of points corresponds to the number of geographic connections. the colored lines represent statistical support for a given viral movement pathway. only those viral lineage movements supported with a BF > 6 are shown. we summarize the average net Markov jumps (jumps to\u2014jumps from) and their 95% credible intervals. there has been an increasing frequency of DENV lineage co-occurrence in china over time, concomitant with its increasing centrality in the Asian air transportation network. if destination and timing of virus introductions coincide with a climatically suitable period then an epidemic can become established in a susceptible recipient population. if the destination and timing of virus introductions coincides with a climatically suitable period then an epidemic can become established in a susceptible recipient population. implementation of disinfection is proving effective in vector control and disease prevention. analysis of the air transportation network indicates differences in roles of air transport nodes in the regional-scale dissemination of DENV lineages. our data suggest that large transportation hubs account for most of the inferred virus lineage movements within their respective networks. the low level of network centrality of Vietnam may explain its limited role in regional DENV geographical dissemination. genetic analyses were limited to DENV in Asia and do not consider transmission to or from other regions. uneven sampling of DENV sequences in Asia, especially in few countries after 2000 (e.g. Vietnam and Singapore) necessitate the use of sub-sampling analyses that accounted for the number of samples per location. the total number of subsampled sequences analyzed were 327 for DENV-1, 357 for DENV-2, and 202 for DENV-3. TempEst was used to obtain exploratory regression based on the maximum likelihood trees. (89.8KB, docx) S2 Table. Strongly supported DENV migrations estimated from E gene segment."}
