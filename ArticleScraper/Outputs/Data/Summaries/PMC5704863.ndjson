{"summary": "a 3-month history of moderate-to-high fever was reported in an otherwise healthy 54-year-old man. Enhanced computed tomography scans of his chest showed a remarkable progressive enlargement of bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 2 weeks. the term of fever of unknown origin (FUO) was coined in the 1960s to define a body temperature above 38.3\u00b0 C for >3 weeks without diagnosis. no etiology could be determined in 10% to 32% of fever cases. 5% of patients have a final ominous prognosis with a neoplastic diagnosis. case report A 54-year-old man with a 3-month history of moderate-to-high fever (38.5\u00b0C\u201339.4\u00b0C) was referred to west China Hospital of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China) the fever arose without a trace and spiked 3 to 4 times per day with mild headache and dry cough. mL, [RR] 0.046 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (10.7 mg/dL, [RR] 0.5 mg/dL), interleukin-6 (44.12 pg/mL, [RR] 0.00\u20137.00 pg/mL) no bacterial and fungal pathogens were cultured from blood, sputum, bone marrow, or bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed intumescence of bilateral cervical and right supraclavicular lymph nodes, and pulmonary emphysema with bilateral multiple small nodules. biopsy specimens taken from the right supraclavicular lymph node showed nonspecific inflammation with cellular infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells. RP was confirmed by an 18F-FDG PET/CT with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes. the patient was treated with methylprednisolone 40 mg daily with rapid improvement in his symptoms. negative results in detailed medical history review, repeated physical examinations, and comprehensive serological tests, as well as nonresponse to antibiotic therapy all excluded the infectious, NIID, and neoplastic identifications. the absence of lymph nodes enlargement after corticosteroids therapy alone in this case further confirmed the diagnosis of RP rather than lymphoma. chondritis is absent in nearly half of the cases with some general and unspecific signs as the presenting symptom long before cartilaginous inflammation begins. the relationship between these atypical features and RP is still unknown. tracheal and bronchial cartilage was already disappeared. phonia, respiratory distress, and recurrent pneumonias may result in a dynamic airway collapse, causing respiratory failure and sudden death. the patient did not develop severe dyspnea, so was treated with only steroid without any immunosuppressive agent."}
