{"summary": "human synthetic single-chain fragment variable (scFv) ETH-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scFvs against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. selected human scFv antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV can be easily isolated by selecting the ETH-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen. the phospho-protein is a 423 amino acid, predicted phospho-protein of 46 kDa. it shares little homology with other members of the Coronavirus genus. anti N antibodies are detected early and with high specificity during infection. synthetic human recombinant antibodies library (ETH-2) consists of a large array (more than 109 antibody combination) of scFv polypeptides displayed on surface of M13 phage. diversity of the light chain was created by randomizing six positions (91 to 96) in the CDR3 [8] the culture was grown up to OD600 nm 0.4\u20130.5 and infected with M13 K07 helper phage in a ratio of around 20:1 phage/bacteria. the rescued phages were concentrated by precipitation with PEG 6000 and used for next round of panning. the reaction was developed using 3, 31-5, 51-tetramethylbenzidin BM blue, POD-substrate soluble (Roche Diagnostics; IN, USA) the reaction was detected with an ELISA reader (Biorad; CA, USA) the results were expressed as A (absorbance) = A(450 nm)-A(620 nm) the slides were incubated for 1 hour at RT with an anti-glucose oxidase phage or scFv containing supernatant. after washings, the slides were treated for 30 minutes at RT. DNA characterization and sequences Plasmid DNA from individual bacterial colonies of MA2.D5, MA2.D7 and MA2.E3 clones was digested. synthetic human recombinant antibodies library (ETH-2) consists of a large array of scFv polypeptides displayed on surface of M13 phage. it was built by random mutagenesis of the CDR3 of only three antibody germline gene segments. diversity of the light chain was created by randomizing six positions (91 to 96) in the CDR3 [8] up to OD600 nm 0.4\u20130.5 and infected with M13 K07 helper phage in a ratio of around 20:1 phage/bacteria. colonies were grown in 96 flat bottomed wells (Nunc) for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C in 180 l 2 YTA medium and glucose 0.1% in 96 well plates. plates were spinned down at 1800 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing soluble sc the reaction was detected with an ELISA reader (Biorad; CA, USA) the results were expressed as A (absorbance) = A(450 nm)-A(620 nm) the membrane was blocked in 4% MPBS ON at RT. the slides were incubated for 1 hour at RT with an anti-M13 secondary mouse antibody (5 g/ml in 20 l TPBS) (Amersham) or with an anti-FLAG secondary mouse antibody (5 g/ml in 20 l TPBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) for labelling phage and scFv reactive antibodies. DNA characterization and sequences Plasmid DNA from individual bacterial colonies of MA2.D5, MA2.D7 scFvs derived from IPTG inducted colonies were screened by ELISA. several of them proved to be specific for N protein (Figure 1). ELISA values of the scFv clones against N protein (panel A) were scored as positive reactions. western blotting analysis shows that all scFv antibodies react with a 46\u201348 kDa band corresponding to the MW of the N protein (B, B', B\") scFvs MA2.E3 and MA2.D7 also react with a 28\u201330 KDa and 12\u201314 KDa band (B, B) corresponding to the MW of N2 and N3 protein fragments respectively. MA2.D5 antibody specifically recognizes SARS-CoV particles in infected vero cells. the other two antibodies MA2.D7 and MA2.E3 did not prove to be useful for SARS-CoV determination in infected cells. scFv populations specifically recognizing the N protein of SARS-CoV were isolated after only three rounds of selection. scFvs derived from IPTG inducted colonies were screened by ELISA and several proved to be specific for N protein. scFvs MA2.E3, MA2.D5 and MA2.D7 antibody clones showed distinct N protein recognition patterns in an ELISA (A, A', A\") were also analyzed for different epitope recognition by western blot. scFvs MA2.E3 and MA2.D7 react with a 46\u201348 kDa band corresponding to the MW of the N protein (B, B', B\") kDa and the integrity of the genes encoding for the cognate scFvs displayed on M13 phage. each single scFv antibody clone possess a unique DNA sequence encoding for the CDR3 region. this uniqueness is consistent with the distinct epitope recognition patterns of the three scFvs noted above. soluble human scFvs selected from the ETH-2 library are the first antibodies so far described which are able to detect SARS-CoV N protein in different routinary laboratory techniques such as ELISA, Western blot and immunocytochemistry. soluble human scFvs expressed on phages have proved to recognize N protein only in ELISA. the genes encoding for the selected MA2.D5, MA2.D7 and MA2.E3 antibodies have been isolated and sequenced. it is thought that intracellular expression of scFv antibodies may be superior over alternative methods for gene inactivation such as anti-sense RNA and dominant negative mutants because of its high specificity. author's contributions MF carried out phage antibodies and scFvs selection from all different N-antigens. AA participated in the genetic molecular, biochemical and immunohistochemical characterization of scFvs specific for distinct epitopes of N protein."}
