{"summary": "the human rhinovirus has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. the importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. in march 2009, the novel swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) was reported in Mexico causing great fear in countries worldwide. the spread in Europe was however slower than expected [4]. the delayed spread of H1N1 in Sweden during the early autumn of 2009 has been suggested to be due to viral interference with human rhinovirus. a secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. the catchment area covered 221 585 children 0\u201317 years. the policy of the hospital during the H1N1 pandemic was to collect respiratory samples for viral PCR analyses. term birth, congenital heart disease and chronic respiratory disease were classified as uncomplicated (admitted for observation, slight dehydration), respiratory problems such as wheezing, tracheitis, croup and obstructive apnea. suspected bacterial infections such as pneumonia, empyema, bacterial tonsillitis and otitis media, 4) seizures (both febrile and afebrile), 5) other manifestations (gastroente in-house real-time PCR with a virus panel including influenza A seasonal (FluA), influenza B (FluB), human adenovirus (HAdV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenzavirus 1\u20133 (PIV1-3), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human enterovirus (HEV) and coronavirus serotypes 229E, HKU1, NL63 and study was a retrospective study of children 0\u201317 years with suspected influenza admitted to inpatient care between July 1 and December 30 2009. the catchment area covered 221 585 children 0\u201317 years. the policy of the hospital during the H1N1 pandemic was to collect respiratory samples for viral PCR analyses from every child who was admitted to inpatient care. children with multiple episodes of obstructive bronchitis, 3) neuromuscular disease, 4) immunosuppression, 5) preterm birth, congenital heart disease and chronic respiratory disease. clinical manifestations during admission were further classified as: 1) uncomplicated (admitted for observation, slight dehydration), 3) suspected bacterial infections such as pneumonia, empyema, bacterial tonsillitis and otitis media, 4) seizures (both febrile and af samples were extracted with MagAttract Virus Mini M48 kit (Qiagen) in a BioRobot M48 instrument. PCR was based on separate single PCRs. duplex PCR was used for PIV1 and PIV3 and for PIV2 and HCoV-229E. data analysis Data were analyzed in STATA version 12.0 and R version 1.40. in order to address temporal variations and age co-infections were studied for every half-month. stratification for age (1 year, 1 to 6 years and >6 years of age) was performed. n (%) H1N1 HAdV HBoV HCoV HEV HMPV HRV RSV PIV1 PIV2 Positive samplesa 83 (16.5) 29 (5.8) 29 (5.8) 17 (3.4) 13 (2.6) 2 (0.4) 141 (28.1) 12 (2.4) 22 (4.4) 9 (1.8) 2 (0.4) Single infections 71 (85.5) 18 (62.1) 11 (37.9) 6 (35.3) 12 (92.3) 1 (50.0) triple and quadruple infections counted as multiple double infections. total number of PCR-negative children (neg, n = 193) and total number of sampled children (n = 502).

Sweden adopted countrywide vaccination against H1N1 reaching a coverage of approximately 60% of the population. the first doses distributed in the middle of October 2009 were associated with a large number of other respiratory viruses."}
