{"summary": "T cells of the immune system recognize antigens as short peptide fragments. self proteins include all proteins produced by the cells of the host. foreign peptides are derived from pathogens, environmental antigens and tumor cells. BALB/c mice express three class I (H2-Kd, H2-Ld and H2-Dd) and two class II (I-Ad and I-Ed) molecules. several publicly available prediction systems for MHC class I and class II binding peptides provide the prediction models for (histocompatibility complex-2) H2d alleles. the prediction scores were inspected for all permissible amino acids at each of the anchor positions. the final binding scores were normalized to a scale of 1\u20139 and the final models were validated rigorously. in the training sets is shown in Table 1. no one method of predicting peptide\u2013MHC binding consistently outperforms the rest. the most appropriate predictive model depends on the amount of data available in Ref. (16). PREDBALB/c uses a set of graphical user interface forms. the interface was built using a combination of Perl, CGI and C programs. the default selection on the webpage is \u2018all H2d\u2019 molecules. y-axis represents the binding score of the 9mer peptide. the user can sort the peptides by their binding scores. the user can choose to view only predicted binders with binding scores above a certain threshold. the predicted binding scores of individual 9mers in each peptide are not shown. the predicted binding scores are represented by the highest individual 9mer binding score within the input peptide. CONCLUSION PREDBALB/c marks a new direction in predictive modeling of MHC-binding peptides and T-cell epitopes. the focus on the complete set of MHC alleles is closer to studies involving laboratory animals."}
