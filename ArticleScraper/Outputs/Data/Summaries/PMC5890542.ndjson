{"summary": "many approaches to nucleoside drug design have evolved over the years. many of these are still used in the clinic today, including acyclovir,9 ganciclovir,10 and penciclovir. heterocyclic nucleosides are critical for base pairing and base stacking. the bicyclic purine ring is \u201csplit\u201d into its two components, for example, a pyrimidine and imidazole ring. this allows for rotation of the two pieces while still retaining the aromatic system. the first distal fleximers developed were obtained via a ring opening reaction on a series of tricyclic nucleosides. by treating the thiophene-expanded tricyclic nucleoside with Raney nickel, the sulfur in the spacer ring was removed, leaving the heterocycles free to rotate about the remaining carbon\u2013carbon bond of the middle ring. inhibition of SAHase can lead to incomplete biological methylations that utilize S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. when SAHase is inhibited, it leads to a buildup of SAH, which inhibits the methyltransferases. this leads to incomplete translation and transcription. this is the first and only report of a guanosine nucleoside inhibiting this adenosine-metabolizing enzyme. computational results in the binding site of SAHase revealed a curved syn-like conformation for the fleximer. this in turn swung the amino group of the Flex-G up into the area of the binding site where the amino group of adenosine typically resides. GFPP is an enzyme involved in the formation of GDP-fucose38. it is produced through two separate and distinctly different pathways. the de novo pathway from GDP-L-mannose is well characterized. however, the salvage pathway via GTP and L-fucose-1-phosphate was poorly understood. a series of carbocyclic fleximers are potential antiparasitic agents. adenosine nucleosides are known to be the best SAHase inhibitors. the first series focused on a different connectivity for the base moieties. wijn et al.46\u201348 Initially, we thought that reversing the connectivity might also lead to inhibition of both purine and pyrimidine metabolizing enzyme. some of the reverse fleximers proved to be active against adenosine deaminase (ADA),27 by acting as product inhibitors, while the forward analogues failed to show any real activity. despite the low yields, we were able to obtain enough to make the McGuigan ProTide55,56 and have both tested. no toxicity was noted at all levels tested and the presence of the ProTide moiety did increase the activity. the compounds, including the triphosphate (2MR04, Figure 15), were screened against the MERS and SARS polymerases. additional studies are currently underway to fully characterize these differences as well as to elucidate exactly how these compounds are working in coronaviruses. enzymatic transglycosylation in their synthetic route to realize a series of 2\u2032-deoxyribose imidazole-substituted fleximers (Scheme 1).62 Using purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) or nucleoside N-deoxyribosyltransferases, the base of thymidine was readily switched with a wide variety of aryl-substituted imidazo peyrottes et al. incorporated the triazole in their -hydroxyphosphonate fleximers. oxadiazole-substituted imidazole fleximers by means of an unexpected ring opening of an adenosine N-oxide nucleoside occurred when treated with various anhydrides. a series of fleximers employing benzene rings instead of the typical ribose, 2\u2032-deoxyribose sugar were constructed. previous studies from this group with purines substituted with benzene rings led to some interesting activity against mycobacteria,68\u201370. the results outlined herein underline the growing importance of the flex approach for targeting viruses and other biologically significant enzymes. this speaks to our theory that the fleximer and enzyme are working as \u201cdance partners,\u201d which leads to their selectivity rather than indiscriminant activity."}
