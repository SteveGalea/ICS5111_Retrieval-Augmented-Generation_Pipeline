{"summary": "a thorough study of the spread causes, spread routes, spread processes, and epidemic laws of infectious diseases is the main method for effective prevention, control, and elimination of infectious diseases. the essence of infectious disease dynamics is to establish a mathematical model that can reflect the spread process, spread law, and spread trend of infectious diseases. \"threshold theory\" was proposed to distinguish spread or regression of the disease. deterministic model based on a differential equation has been widely accepted. the model considers that the latency of infectious diseases also has an impact. the concept of cellular automata was proposed in the 1940s. it can be described as a dynamic system consisting of a transformation function in cellular space, which is discrete in time and space. the cellular automata model can be formally expressed as C A = ( L C, S, M, f ), where C A represents the cellular automaton system. cellular automata can perform experiments that cannot be done in real life by modeling. this paper considered that in real society, population mobility is caused by economic development, living environment, education level, and other factors. population density, sex ratio, and age structure also have some influence on the spread of infectious diseases. infected population is denoted as I ( t ), meaning the number of members of the population who are immune at t time. Dead population is denoted as D ( t ), meaning the number of members of the population who died of infectious diseases at time t. i o and s o represent the ratio of infected and susceptible individuals in the initial population, respectively. the transition relationships of states in the SLIRDS model are shown in Figure 2. cellular automata cannot reflect every individual\u2019s randomness. unified parameters T 1, T 2, and T 3 are introduced. each individual shows different resistance, infectivity, and infectious range to disease. in real life, the population is not divided by rules like cellular automata. in the southeast coastal areas, the distribution of population in the same city is not uniform. in areas with a large population density, the distance between individuals is shorter and the spread range of individuals is wider. the probability of infection P ( i, j ) ( t ) was used to describe individual heterogeneity. individual heterogeneity is determined by the individual\u2019s resistance to disease and the infectivity of neighbor cells. the infection rate of cell C ( i, j ) at time t is defined as follows: P ( i, j ) ( t ) C ( i + 1, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i + 1, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i + 1, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i + 1, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i + 1, j f C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) represents the infectivity of cell C ( i, j ) to cell C ( i, j ). f C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) obeys (0,1) uniform distribution [23]. the initial state of all individuals is set to S = 1, the state of the infected individuals is set to S = 2. otherwise, the individual enters into dead state with probability. individual immunity to the infectious disease disappears with probability. the state of the population was divided into susceptible, latent, infected, recovered, and dead. the SLIRDS model can be described through the following differential equation models: d S ( t ) d ( t ) = R ( t ) S ( t ) I ( t ) d L ( t ) d ( t ) = S ( t ) d ( t ) d ( t ) = I ( t ) d ( t ) d ( t ) = I ( t d i and d j ( | d i |, | d j | L ) are chosen randomly for each selected individual C ( i, j ) and then C ( i, j ) and C ( i + d i, j + d j ) are exchanged to complete the individual movement. each non-zero element of the matrix represents an effective individual. cellular automata cannot reflect every individual\u2019s randomness. unified parameters T 1, T 2, and T 3 are introduced. T 1 represents the maximum peak of latency time for each individual. T 2 represents the maximum peak of illness time for each individual. in order to study and analyze the influence of population density on infectious disease spread, each individual is mapped into a cell in the cellular automata model. when there is no individual and the individual is in dead state, they are not infectious. in order to simulate the difference in population density, the population density can be simulated by setting the value of D ( t) in the initial state. the state of neighbor cells of cell C ( i, j) at (i, j) can be expressed by an adjacency matrix as follows: N C ( i, j ) = [ S ( i 1, j 1 ) ( t ) S ( i 1, j + 1 ) ( t ) S ( i, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i, j + 1 ) ( t ) C ( i, j = a 4 ( k, l ) Q C ( i, j ) k i a n d i j P C ( i, j ) k = i o r i = j P C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) ( t ) = f C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) = f the infection probability of each individual is determined by its own resistance to infectious diseases and the infectivity of its neighbors. the initial state of all individuals is set to S = 1, the state of the infected individuals is set to S = 2. Individuals in cells are updated according to the following rules. individual latency time T 1 ( i, j ) = T 1 ( S ( i, j ) = 2, when T 1 ( S ( i, j ) = 2, when T 1 ( S ( i, j ) ( t + 1 ) = 2. Otherwise, S ( i, j ) ( t + 1 ) = 3. individual immunity to the infectious disease disappears with probability. the individual turns into susceptible state, S ( i, j ) ( t ) = 1. middle-aged people in remote mountainous areas go to work in big cities. there is an imbalance in the proportion of men to women. in areas where labor is scarce, there is an imbalance in the proportion of men to women. the infection rate of cell C ( i, j) at time t is defined as follows: Q C ( i, j ) k = i o r i = j P C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t ) ( t the probability of infection is inversely proportional to one\u2019s own resistance, it is proportional to the infectivity of one\u2019s neighbors. f C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) represents the infectious disease resistance of cell C ( i, j ) and f C ( i, j ), C ( k, l ) obeys (0,1) uniform distribution. n are the proportion of various age groups in the population, f 1,..., f n are the influence coefficient of infectious diseases on n groups of populations. the infection probability of each individual is determined by its own resistance to infectious diseases and the infectivity of its neighbors. MATLAB simulation software (R2013b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) used pandemic influenza A (H1N1) as an example to simulate the spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1). the simulated initial number of members of the infected population was consistent with the actual number of members of the infected population. the simulated initial number of members of the infected population was consistent with the actual data of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Beijing in Mainland China (June\u2013July 2009) the number of members of the population that died, were susceptible, were infected, and were immunized was replaced by death, susceptibility, infection and immunization rates. from the death rate curve in Figure 4a, it can be seen that the death rate increases with the increase of population density, but the overall trend is rising and tending to be stable. as shown in Figure 5a, we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on infected population under different influence coefficients. when infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value. however, the overall trend is first rising and then falling, and finally tends to be stable. two simulation results are shown in Figure 6. Infectious disease spread state distribution with different sex ratios. from the death curve in Figure 6a, we can see that when the number of males is large, the number of deaths is higher, but the overall trend is rising and gradually stable. the influence coefficients of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on children, adolescents, youth, middle-aged people, and elderly people were set to f 1 = 0.65, f 2 = 0.58, f 3 = 0.46, f 4 = 0.37, f 5 = 0.68. it can be seen that the number of deaths in the aged cities is the largest. population density = 1, susceptible population:latent population:infected population = 0.872:0.107:0.021. population density = 0.8, susceptible population:latent population:infected population = 0.6985:0.0855:0.016. from the death rate curve in Figure 4a, it can be seen that death rate increases with the increase of population density. the change in population density has little influence on the immune population. when the population density is large, the immunity first rises and then reaches a stable value. the overall trend is first rising and then falling, and finally tends to be stable. in cities with more males than females, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population because of the large population base of males. the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on males and females was set to g m = 0.55, g f = 0.35. when the number of males is large, the number of members of the immunization population increases first and then reaches a stable value. when the number of males is larger in the cities where infectious diseases affect men more, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population. the ratio of males to females was 4:1. in cities with more males than females, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population because of the large population base of males. in simulation experiments, the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on males and females is very different. from the immunization curve in Figure 6c, we can see that infectious diseases have little influence on the immunization population. when the number of males is large, the number of members of the immunization population increases first, and then reaches a stable value. infectious disease spread state distribution with different age structure. death rate curve; (b) Susceptibility rate curve; (d) Immunization rate curve. number of young urban deaths is only inferior to that of the aged cities. the influence of sex ratio on the spread of infectious diseases was set to 4:1. because of the large population base of males, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population when the infection coefficient is greater. the influence coefficients of infectious diseases on males and females were 0.9. the SLIRDS model was proposed in this paper to study the main factors that affect the spread process of infectious diseases. the system can better analyze the factors affecting the spread of infectious diseases, and provide better theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases."}
