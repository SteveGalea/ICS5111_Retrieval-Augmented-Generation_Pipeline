{"summary": "EAV infects horses and donkeys and leads to abortions in pregnant mares. virus is transmitted via respiratory route and via contaminated semen of previously infected stallions. chimeric PRRSV arterivirus exhibits broadened cellular tropism of the EAV. the trimer itself serves as a major tropism determinant for arteriviruses. the location for arterivirus budding is not known. previous studies have shown that arterivirus budding involves the wrapping of a preformed nucleocapsid by membranes in the ER or Golgi complex. nt culture in DMEM mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the Leibovitz L-15 medium (Cytogen, Lodz, Poland) the cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of air with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. newly constructed plasmids were propagated in competent Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha (Genbank Y07862.2) pEAV211Gp4KOAscI was cloned to pEAV2114KOAscI with the AscI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. all of the generated plasmids were sequenced with the RGEAVEcoRIRev primer (Genomed, Warszawa, Poland) pEAV211Gp4KO EAV211AsciFor ctcgttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA were lysed and subjected to western blotting with anti-HA and anti-N antibodies. the cells were then transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA: pEAV211 (WT), lane 1; pEAV211s3/4, lane 2; pEAV211Gp3-HA, lane 3; and untransfected cells, the cells were pulsed twice at 850 V, 25 F; resuspended in DMEM/L-15 5% FCS; and seeded into two wells of the 6-well plate. the cells were then kept at 37 \u00b0C until the CPE was observed. half of the cells were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing. plaque assay was performed on the BHK-21 cells grown on 6-well plates with GMEM supplemented with 1% FCS, 1% L-glutamine, and 0.75% carboxymethyl cellulose. the overlays were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet for three days p.i. the cDNA was generated with Maxima H minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit. the cDNA was subjected to PCR reaction with EAVFor and EAVRev primers. the thermal profile was as follows: initial denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 5 min. the samples were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F; 5 U/L, 2 h at 37 \u00b0C) or endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; 5 U/L, 1 h at 37 \u00b0C) after the deglycosylation reaction, the cells were supplemented with reducing SDS-PAGE buffer and subjected to mice monoclonal anti-N antibody diluted in a blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:800, goat anti-mouse IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 568 and 1:800 goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, UK) mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (1:200, 16B12 Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA), rabbit anti-E antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-PDI (1:250, 1D3, Enzo Life Sciences, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-membrin (1:100, 4HAD6, Enzo Life Sciences, USA), and mouse monoclonal anti-ERGIC (1:150, OTI1A8, Enzo Life Sciences, USA) each co the gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. after blocking the membranes overnight at 4 \u00b0C, the antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h. 20 mL of cell-free supernatants were transferred to filters and centrifuged at 3500 g for 40 min at room temperature. the cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of air with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. the cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of air with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. pEAV211 is a derivate of the pEAV030 (Genbank Y07862.2) and described in reference [17]. we generated specific DNA fragments by overlap extension PCR. we purified them from the gel with the aid of the Gel-out kit. p product produced the pEAV211Gp3-HA vector. all of the generated plasmids were sequenced with the RGEAVEcoRIRev primer. all of the genes subjected to mutations in plasmids were sequenced before use in experiments. pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA were transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA. expression of Gp3-HA and N protein in infected BHK-21 cells (C) pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA were transfected with culture supernatants. they were then subjected to immunofluorescence 24 h post-infection with anti-N and anti-HA antibodies. the cells were then kept at 37 \u00b0C until the CPE was observed. the remaining supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored in 80 \u00b0C as a P0 stock. the cells were then washed two times with PBS, with calcium and magnesium, and then overlaid with 2 mL of DMEM/L-15 1% FCS and 1% l-glutamine culture medium. supernatants were collected, centrifuged, and stored in 80 \u00b0C. remaining cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged, and stored in 80 \u00b0C. to verify the stability of the HA-tag, the cells were grown on glass coverslips. the RT-PCR products were gel-purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) the sense and antisense strands were sequenced (Genomed, Warsaw, Poland), and the sense and antisense strands were sequenced. cells were seeded in the complete medium onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates. after 24 h, the cell culture medium was replaced with DMEM/L-15. cells were infected with EAV wt, EAV s3/4, EAVGp3-HA or left uninfected. after 2 h, the cells were washed two times with PBS. the images were recorded using a Zeiss cell Observer SD confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an EMCCD QImaging Rolera EM-C2 camera and 40\u201363 oil objectives (0.167 m and 0.106 m per pixel, respectively) the imaging was performed sequentially using 405 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm laser lines. the images were created using GraphPad Prism 8 software. the significance was estimated using one-way ANOVA. the images were deconvoluted using the confocal microscope. suitable horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:4000; anti-rabbit or anti-mouse; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. the signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL plus reagent. recombinant EAV with Gp3 Carrying HA-Tag (Gp3-HA) washed with MNT, boiled with reducing or non-reducing SDS buffer. the overlap between ORF3 and ORF4 consists of 98 nt, while that between ORF2 and ORF3 is 202 nt. the cloning procedure is shown in Figure 1A. expression of Gp3-HA was only observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4 and pEAV211Gp3-HA. however, it was not observed in pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4 or mock-transfected cells. in vitro growth properties of EAVs3/4 and EAVGp3-HA viruses were compared to those of EAV-wt. all tested viruses replicated to titers that exceeded 107 PFU/mL of cell culture fluid. this suggests that the separation of the ORF3 and ORF4 as well as introduction of the HA-tag to the Gp3 protein did not have a significant effect on the EAV progeny\u2019s production. the nt sequence of the HA-tag was still present in P19. however, the presence of additional nt peaks in P19 suggested the increase of quasispecies of the virus. lysates were digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endo--N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; cleaves only the high-mannose-type carbohydrates) before SDS-PAGE. cell lysates were subjected to both non-reducing and reducing conditions, followed by western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. a part of the samples was subjected to deglycosylation with endoglucosidase H (EH) or PNgase F (PF) the samples were then subjected to western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. the tagged Gp3-HA is present in the virions as a monomer and a trimer (B). all samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibodies. the remaining 5% of the sample was boiled with non-reducing or reducing SDS buffer (WSL\u2014whole supernatant lysate) a major part of the purified virus sample (95%) was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibodies. in non-reducing conditions, the Gp3-HA was present in virions in small amounts. in non-reducing conditions, only the monomeric form was present. sate (WSL), which is the virion fraction, and whole cell lysates (WCL) were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and western blotting using anti-E antibodies. in the purified virion, only one band was detected, which is a feature that has been previously observed. however, in the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, no E protein could be detected. ouse antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. cells were infected as above; cells (18 h p.i.) were subjected to immunofluorescence with rabbit anti-HA antibodies and mouse anti-N antibodies. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. the Gp3-HA was co-localized with ER markers and cis-Golgi markers. the BHK-21 cells were infected with EAVGp3-HA at an MOI of 1 or left uninfected. cells (18 h p.i.) were then subjected to immunofluorescence. -HA antibodies and mouse anti-membrin antibodies and secondary antibodies were stained with DAPI. the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. rabbit anti-E antibodies and mouse anti-ERGIC53 antibody and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit antibodies stained with DAPI. the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. in vitro-transcribed viral RNAs from pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4 and pEAV211Gp3-HA were introduced into the BHK-21 cells using electroporation. after 48 h, the cells were harvested and examined by western blotting analysis using antibodies that are specific to the N protein and HA-tag. the expression of Gp3-HA was only observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from p pEAV211s3/4 and pEAV211Gp3-HA viruses are fully replication competent when introduced into the susceptible mammalian cells. in vitro growth properties of EAVs3/4 and EAVGp3-HA viruses were compared to those of EAV-wt using one-step growth curve experiments for BHK-21 cells. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. chroomatograms of viral DNA sequences obtained from EAVGp3-HA infected cells. the fragment of the HA-tag nt sequence was maintained. the presence of additional nt peaks in P19 suggested the increase of quasispecies of the virus. the Gp3-HA in infected cells is N-glycosylated and does not pass the Medial Golgi Compartment. the HA-tag added to the C-terminus of Gp3 is expressed at least up to P15. dase F (PNGase F) or endo--N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; cleaves only the high-mannose-type carbohydrates) were completely cleaved by both enzymes. endo H cannot cleave the N-glycans with additional modifications occurring in the medial or trans-Golgi compartment. the Gp3-HA expressed in infected cells exhibits the same behavior as tagged Gp3-HA is present in the virions as a monomer and a trimer (B) the cells were infected with P1 EAVGp3-HA stock at an MOI of 1. major part (95%) of the purified virus sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibodies. the tagged Gp3-HA is incorporated into the virions. the cells were infected with the P1 EAVGp3-HA stock. after 22 h post-infection, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged and purified using filter devices. anti-HA antibodies and purified supernatant lysate (WSL) were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and western blotting using anti-E antibodies. in the purified virion, only one band was detected, which is a feature that has been previously observed. the BHK-21 cells were infected with EAVGp3-HA at an MOI of 1 or left uninfected. then, the cells (18 h p.i.) were subjected to immunofluorescence with mouse anti-HA antibodies and rabbit anti-E antibodies and secondary Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. the BHK-21 cells were infected with recombinant EAVGp3-HA virus. the cells (18h p.i.) were fixed and subjected to double immunostaining. the localization of Gp3-HA was analyzed using antibodies directed against markers of the secretory pathway. immunofluorescence samples stained with rabbit anti-HA antibodies and mouse anti-membrin antibodies and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit antibodies. Gp3-HA is shown in green, membrin is shown in red. the immunofluorescence samples stained with rabbit anti-E antibodies and mouse anti-PDI antibodies and secondary antibodies. E is shown in green, PDI is shown in red. a small 9 aa epitope was successfully added to the N terminus of the M protein (ORF6). however, the overlapping sequences between major structural protein coding gens ORFs 4, 5 and 6 are smaller compared to the overlap between genes coding for minor virion proteins. the introduction into the EAV genome composed of additional 17\u201341 nucleotides and was stable up to P2. we used the recombinant EAV to study the localization of the Gp3-HA. previously, the localization of the Gp3 was tested in transfected cells only. we also performed detailed co-localization of the E. both Gp3-HA and E localized primarily in the ER. some of the Gp3-HA and E may have escaped from ER because of overexpression. minor proteins may not be present at the assembly site. only proper folded and assembled transmembrane proteins are exported from ER. the failure to achieve budding by co-expression of only N, Gp5 and M without the EAV RNA suggests there are additional factors in the EAV particle formation. it is possible that the arterivirus assembly is coupled to viral genome replication, interaction of RNA with structural proteins, or to the expression of non-structural proteins. the Gp3-HA and E localized mainly in the ER. but the mechanism of lower incorporation of the minor glycoproteins in arteriviruses might be different, and not dependent on the localization of the proteins."}
