{"summary": "ZIKV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. it is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. the pathogenesis of the virus is still poorly understood. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is converted from LC3-I to the lipidated LC3-II and anchored to the autophagic membrane. lipidated LC3-II usually interacts with p62, which is a multifunctional protein that is degraded by the autophagic-lysosome pathway. autophagy can be induced by various stress stimuli, including nutrient starvation and viral infection. cells were found to cause inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to defective neurogenesis and aberrant activation of autophagy. inhibition of autophagy limits vertical transmission of Zika virus in pregnant mice. further studies are needed to explore the exact mechanism of ZIKV-induced autophagy and the functional role for viral replication. antibodies and Chemicals Rapamycin and wortmannin were cultured in RPMI1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. polyclonal rabbit anti-DENV NS3 was purchased from GeneTex (Irvine, CA, USA) monoclonal rabbit anti-p62 and anti-GAPDH antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) g-Feng Qin was propagated in C6/36 cells. the stock virus was stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. lentivirus vector was used as a negative control. plaque assay titers were determined by plaque assay performed in triplicate. cells were infected with lentivirus expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3. after 1 h of adsorption, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet staining. s were separated using 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) the proteins of interest were identified specifically using primary antibodies, and detected visually using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies. polyclonal rabbit anti-DENV NS3 was purchased from GeneTex (Irvine, CA, USA) monoclonal rabbit anti-p62 and anti-GAPDH antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) cell supernatants were collected, centrifuged, filtrated, and adopted to transduce HUVEC at 50 to 80% confluence. cells were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or indicated MOIs for 1 h in serum-free opti-MEM. cells were washed with PBS and cultured in fresh complete media for various times. cells were infected with lentivirus expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3. after 1 h of adsorption, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet staining. recombinant fluorescent LC3 was observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope. the proteins of interest were identified specifically using primary antibodies. immunoactivity was visualized using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies. a largely dispersed fluorescence distribution was observed in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells. further quantitative analysis indicated that the number of cells with fluorescent LC3 dot formation increased during ZIKV infection. the ratios of LC3-II to GAPDH were calculated and presented. the LC3-II/GAPDH ratio was then calculated to reflect autophagy activity. in ZIKV-infected cells by 18 h post-infection (hpi), it was maintained until at least 36 hpi. the inhibition of autophagy is associated with the accumulation of p62. this is considered to be an indicator in the assessment of normal autophagic flux. lentivirus transduced with mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 were either uninfected or infected with ZIKV at MOI 1. a slight shift from yellow to partially red fluorescence was observed in ZIKV-infected HUVEC expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3. this indicates an increase in the level of autophagic flux (Figure 2C) expression of viral NS3 protein was not correspondingly decreased. yields of extracellular virus were decreased 6.51-fold at 18 hpi. both Wort and CQ treatment reduced the extracellular yields of ZIKV progeny. determination of extracellular virus yields (pfu/mL) at 18 hpi after treatment with Wort at different concentrations. western blot analysis of autophagy and viral NS3 expression inhibited with CQ at concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 M at 24 hpi. cells were infected with empty lentivirus vector or pLenti-Beclin-1-shRNA. samples were subjected to Western blot analysis (A) or plaque assay (C) the ratios of NS3 to GAPDH were calculated. at 18 and 24 hpi, extracellular virus yields were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. extracellular virus yields at 24 hpi were expressed as pfu/mL. data are presented as means SDs from three independent experiments. a largely dispersed fluorescence distribution was observed in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells. however, a largely dispersed fluorescence distribution was observed in the cytoplasm of mock-infected cells. the ratios of LC3-II to GAPDH were calculated and presented. the LC3-II/GAPDH ratio was then calculated to reflect autophagy activity. LC3-II in ZIKV-infected cells by 18 h post-infection (hpi) and it was maintained until at least 36 hpi. the inhibition of autophagy is associated with the accumulation of p62. it is considered to be an indicator in the assessment of normal autophagic flux. HUVEC transduced with lentivirus expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 were either uninfected or infected with ZIKV at MOI 1. a slight shift from yellow to partially red fluorescence was observed in ZIKV-infected HUVEC expressing mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 from 18 to 24 h following ZIKV infection. expression of viral NS3 protein was not correspondingly decreased. yields of extracellular virus were decreased 6.51-fold at 18 hpi. both Wort and CQ treatment reduced the extracellular yields of ZIKV progeny. determination of extracellular virus yields (pfu/mL) at 18 hpi after treatment with Wort. western blot analysis of autophagy and viral NS3 expression inhibited with CQ at concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 M at 24 hpi. beclin-1-shRNA (short hairpin RNA) inhibits ZIKV production. cells were infected with empty lentivirus vector or pLenti-Beclin-1-shRNA. rapamycin does not promote ZIKV production in HUVEC. extracellular virus yields at 18 and 24 hpi were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells and expressed as pfu/mL. data are presented as means SDs from three independent experiments. cellular autophagy is a common strategy for cell defense after a viral infection. increased autophagy was indicated after ZIKV infection by double-labeled fluorescence of LC3 (Figure 2). this suggests that ZIKV infection likely induces complete autophagy in HUVEC. however, whether ZIKV infection induces autophagy in other cell lines needs to be further investigated. significant changes in ZIKV production result from manipulation of host autophagy pathways by drug compounds or ATGs-specific RNA interference. they suggest that ZIKV partially adopts the action of Beclin-1, which is required for the protective functions of autophagy, to benefit their own replication. mTOR is one of the key regulators of the class I PI3K pathway. it has a negative effect on the formation of autophagy. this indicates that autophagy induced by mTOR is regulated by the class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."}
