{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle in eukaryotic cells. it plays important roles in protein synthesis, modification and processing, folding, assembly, and the transportation of nascent peptide chains. ER stress can be divided into three types, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), the ER overload response, and protein-mediated regulatory responses. the IRE1/ASK1/JNK pathway is important for apoptosis in the ER. the caspase-12 kinase pathway is also involved in many diseases. the CHOP pathway plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis. this factor plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis and microbial infection. PERK PERK is a transmembrane protein and an important sensor that participates in the UPR by attenuating protein translation. PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway is considered to play a pivotal role in inducing cell apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. research shows that CHOP may not fully induce cell death. the active protein then binds the promoters of several genes involved in UPR and ERAD. IRE1 can stimulate the activation of the apoptotic-signaling kinase-1 (ASK1) then activates the downstream kinases, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) which cause apoptosis. IRE1 activates apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which in turn phosphorylates p38MAPK and JNK to activate CHOP. downstream caspase-family proteins can activate and act on the substrate leading to apoptosis. anti-apoptotic proteins mainly include BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and BCL-W. multidomain proteins include BAK, BAX, and BOK. BH3-only domain proteins include BID, BIM, BAD, BIK, NOXA, and PUMA. TRB3 is upregulated by the ER stress-inducible transcriptional factor, ATF4-CHOP (66). the binding site of CHOP overlaps the amino acid response elements in the TRB3 promoter. the expression of TRB3 can inhibit AKT activity. death receptor-mediated apoptosis occurs via death ligands (Fas, TNF, and TRAIL) combined with death receptors. PERK-ATF4-CHOP pathway can induce apoptosis by binding to the death receptor pathway and upregulating the expression of DR4 and DR5 to induce apoptosis. PERK-CHOP function will persist, permitting DR5 mRNA to rise. accumulation of DR5 in the ER and Golgi can drive ligand-independent multimerization of the long splice variants of death receptor 5 (DR5L) tBID has powerful pro-apoptotic activity and can act on mitochondrial membranes with BAK and BAX. tBid regulates mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. CHOP mediates apoptosis through other pathways. tBid also regulates apoptosis through other pathways. scavengers can attenuate the expression of PERK/eIF2/CHOP pathway-related proteins (91) the CHOP gene also directly activates GADD34 (DNA damage protein), which combines with PP1 and dephosphorylates eIF2. the overexpression of CHOP can lead to cell cycle arrest and result in cell death by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein, p21. Knockdown of CHOP prevented the dephosphorylation of its downstream target FOXO3a (Thr32) (58) synoptically, CHOP-dependent apoptosis is mainly mediated by directly or indirectly altering the expression of pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic genes. CHOP can up-regulate the expression of autophagy-related genes at the onset, while in the later stages of starvation, CHOP can gradually initiate apoptosis (105). During normal physiology, CHOP is ubiquitously expressed at very low levels (27), but pathological conditions or microbial infection caused ER stress is overwhelming. PERK/ATF4/cells and eIF2 (Ser51Ala) knock-in cells fail to induce CHOP during ER stress. PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway is considered to play a pivotal function in inducing cell apoptosis. IRE1 splices the substrate precursor, XBP-1, mRNA introns to produce a mature and active XBP-1 protein. the active protein then binds the promoters of several genes involved in UPR and ERAD. IRE1 can stimulate the activation of the apoptotic-signaling kinase-1 (44\u201346) IRE1 activates apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which activates p38MAPK and JNK to activate CHOP. PERK PERK is a transmembrane protein and an important sensor. IRE1 IRE1 is a transmembrane protein containing two functional domains. IRE1 IRE1 contains protein kinase and endoribonuclease activities. IRE1 IRE1 is a transmembrane protein containing two functional domains. IRE1 can stimulate the activation of the apoptotic-signaling kinase-1 (ASK1). it then activates the downstream kinases, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) which cause apoptosis (40), which causes cell apoptosis (47, 48) activation of IRE1 processes unspliced XBP1 mRNA to create activated XBP1(s) which enters the nucleus and controls expression of CHOP. IRE1 activates apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which in turn phosphorylates p38MAPK and JNK to activate CHOP. BH3-only proteins regulate cell apoptosis mainly by inhibiting the expression of the BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein. BH3-only proteins include BID, BIM, BAD, BIK, NOXA, and PUMA (58, 59). expression of TRB3 can inhibit AKT activity and has a pro-apoptotic capacity (70, 71). TRB3 can also inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of AKT by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the Ser473 and Thr308 sites of AKT. death receptor-mediated apoptosis occurs via death ligands (Fas, TNF, and TRAIL) combined with death receptors. the receptor protein, Fas-associated death domain protein, is recruited to form a death-inducing signal complex. the PERK-ATF4-CHOP pathway can induce apoptosis by binding to the death receptor pathway. PERK-CHOP function will persist, permitting DR5 mRNA to rise. DR5L accelerates the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. tBID has powerful pro-apoptotic activity and can act on mitochondrial membranes with BAK and BAX. CHOP can increase the expression of the ERO1 (ER reductase) gene. the highly oxidized state of the ER results in H2O2 leakage into the cytoplasm. high ROS concentrations in the lumen of the ER activate the IP3R1 calcium ion release channel, allowing calcium ions to enter the cytosol. under ER stress, cells with GADD34 mutations can significantly reduce protein complex formation compared to normal cells. the overexpression of CHOP can lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death by inhibiting the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein, p21. apoptosis is mainly mediated by directly or indirectly altering the expression of pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic genes. in the CHOP-induced apoptotic pathway, CHOP regulates the BCL2 protein family. BH3-only proteins regulate cell apoptosis mainly by inhibiting the expression of the BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein. CHOP can downregulate expressions of BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1. oligomers cause release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c (Cyt-C) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) through mitochondria permeabilization, eventually cause cell expression of TRB3 can inhibit AKT activity and has a pro-apoptotic capacity (70, 71). TRB3 can also inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of AKT by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the Ser473 and Thr308 sites of AKT. the receptor protein, Fas-associated death domain protein, is recruited to form a death-inducing signal complex. the PERK-ATF4-CHOP pathway can induce apoptosis by binding to the death receptor pathway and upregulating the expression of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5. the accumulation of DR5 in the ER and Golgi can drive ligand-independent multimerization of the long splice variants of death receptor 5 (DR5L) DR5L accelerates the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activates caspase-8. tBID has powerful pro-apoptotic activity and can act on the mitochondrial membranes with BAK and BAX, which cause Cyt-C release. the highly oxidized state of the ER results in H2O2 leakage into the cytoplasm. high ROS concentrations in the lumen of the ER activate the IP3R1 calcium ion release channel, allowing calcium ions to enter the cytosol. the CHOP-CaMKII pathway also activates JNK, which is involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis by inducing the expression of Fas, NOX2 and oxidative stress under ER stress, cells with GADD34 mutations can significantly reduce protein complex formation compared to normal cells. the overexpression of CHOP can lead to cell cycle arrest and result in cell apoptosis. the relationship between CHOP and p21 may explain changes in the state of the cell. autophagy is a lysosomal degradation system involving the degradation and recycling of obsolete, damaged, or harmful cytoplasmic materials, and organelles. the apoptotic program is activated when such stresses exceed a critical duration or intensity threshold (98) the role of CHOP in ER stress induced apoptosis is unknown. CHOP plays a pivotal role in switching between apoptosis and autophagy. many pathogenic microorganisms infect host cells to induce apoptosis. ER stress occurs at a high intensity or is prolonged. 3 CHOP, BAX, Caspase 3, CHOP-BAX- Caspase 3 Apoptosis and beneficial to CVB3 replication Mice (113) HIV CHOP, p38, BCL2 p38-CHOP-BCL2 Apoptosis BHK-21 cells (114, 115) M. tuberculosis CHOP, Caspase3/9 p-eIF2-CHOP limits M. tuberculosis replication RAW PCV2 triggers the UPR in PK-15 cells by activating the PERK-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP pathway without the concomitant activation of IRE1 or ATF6. PCV2 deploys the UPR to enhance its replication (107) IRE1 antagonizes IBV-induced apoptosis by modulating the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the pro-survival RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) at the same time, IBV infection also activates two other pathways. CHOP deficiency reduces CVB3 replication, cardiac damage, and promotes survival in CVB3-mediated acute viral myocarditis, in vivo. the precise mechanism leading to CHOP-mediated apoptosis remains unclear and requires further investigation. mycobacterium tuberculosis and its antigens have been shown to be associated with IRE1/TRAF2/ASK1/JNK/p38MAPK activation and to result in apoptosis (130). in A549 cells, JNK phosphorylated Bcl-2 to inhibit its anti-apoptotic activity, and also phosphorylated Bax. VacA can upregulate expression of CHOP after gastric epithelial cells are stimulated with cytotoxin A. CHOP is transcriptionally activated by PERK via phosphorylation of eIF2-. Knockdown of CHOP or TRIB3 could also decrease mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. the regulation of CHOP expression plays an important role during microbial infections. the regulation of CHOP expression has been accepted as an approach to remove cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis. overexpression or knock-out of the CHOP gene may be a therapeutic approach to treat related diseases. understanding how CHOP functions during microbial infections will provide better therapeutic approaches to control and prevent diseases. PERK-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP-BCL2 pathway induces UPR and apoptosis. eIF2 dephosphorylation is suppressed by salubrinal, viral replication is limited. IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the UPR was activated. TRIB3) inhibits the ERK pro-survival pathway, thereby promoting apoptosis. IBV induces apoptosis through the IRE/JNK and PERK/PKR pathways. in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, WNV grows to significantly higher viral titers than in wild-type MEFs. the prevention of apoptosis provides a survival advantage because it facilitates bacterial replication inside host cells. the 38 kDa antigen induces the production of ROS and the subsequent ERS via ERO1. ESAT-6 induces CHOP to form dimers with CREB. this leads to decreased Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax expression. toxin produced by Escherichia coli can also cause apoptosis through endogenous and exogenous pathways. toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae serotype I activate both apoptotic cell death signaling and the ER stress response. characterization of CHOP functions during microbial infections will help us understand the pathogenesis of microorganisms. TUDCA administration markedly suppresses cardiac ER stress and CHOP induction. preventing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac inflammation and injury, cardiac dysfunction, reducing CVB3 replication in vivo, and increasing survival rates in CVB3 inoculation-induced AVMC models. IRE1 processes unspliced XBP-1 mRNA into activated XBP1(s) which enters the nucleus and controls the expression of CHOP. IRE1 activates the apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which in turn phosphorylates p38 MAPK/JNK. bag5 can reduce CHOP expression and increase Bcl-2 gene expression. apoptosis induced by CHOP is beneficial to the release and spread of pathogenic microorganisms. however, it is unknown under which conditions apoptosis induced by CHOP is beneficial to the release and spread of pathogenic microorganisms. the intricate balance between the two effects is worth further study. interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
