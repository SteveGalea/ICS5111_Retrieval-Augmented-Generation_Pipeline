{"summary": "the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) has compiled a list of priority pathogens for biodefense (http://www.niaid.nih.gov) several of these are also defined as select agents (http://www.selectagents.gov/) by various agencies such as the health and human services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) biothreat assay is performed on a hardware platform with prototypes known as TIGER [4] and as the Ibis T5000 [5], [5] that is now marketed commercially as the Abbott PLEX-ID [6]. PCR primers are designed to target genomic regions sufficiently conserved so that amplification occurs comprehensively within a biothreat cluster, but not outside of the cluster. a comprehensive biothreat assay was designed to detect ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters. the assay identified the major biothreat organisms and differentiated them from their near neighbors and from thousands of other bacteria and viruses. in each cluster the key biothreat agent and its near neighbors are indicated. these organisms make up the majority of the NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens and HHS/USDA select agents. the biothreat assay described here also detects virulence factors associated with three of the agents. PCR primers were designed to conserve regions within the selected target genes such that the targeted threat agent was clearly identified and differentiated from its near-neighbor species. pXO1 BCT2381 pXO1, reverse transcriptase TACACAGTACTGATGGTTTTTTTTTTGACACTTTTTGGATGGT Bacillus anthracis, pXO2 BCT2379 pXO2, no gene name TGGAAGTGTAAAAAAAATGGAGTCCG TCGATTAAAGAGAGAGATTCTTCAACGCA Brucella melitensis serovar abortus, meliten insertion sequence IS1111A transposase TCAGTATGTATCTCTCCGGCGTGTTCGCTC Francisella tularensis BCT2328 Aspartate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase TGAGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAATG Rickettsia prowazekii, t a pestis BCT2339 F1 Capsule antigen TCCGTTATCGCCATTATTTGGAACT TAAGAGTGATGCTGGCTTTCAACA Yersinia pestis BCT2337 Plasminogen activator precursor precursor TGACATCCGGCTCACGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCAACA Yersinia pestis BCT2326 insertion sequence:IS200-like and disrupted inv TGCTGGTAACAGAGCCTT Bacillus cereus clade is closely related to B. cereus (which causes human food poisoning), B. thuringiensis (an insect pathogen and a biological insecticide), and B. mycoides (considered a harmless saprophyte) BCT352 targeting the translation initiation factor IF-4 (infB) gene and BCT355 targeting the small acid-soluble spore protein (sspE) gene provide signatures that can distinguish B. anthracis from all of the near-neighbor species within the B. cereus clade. virulence of B. anthracis requires the presence of two plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, containing three toxin the majority of the B. anthracis strains tested had a base composition signature of \u201cA42G23C23T21\u201d whereas the B. anthracis strains from the western north American region showed a SNP at this locus and had the signature of \u201cA41G24C23T21\u201d.

Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica contain intact invasin genes. the central region of the Y. pestis inv gene is disrupted by a 708-bp IS200-like element. primers targeting this region allow for the unambiguous detection of Y. pestis. a set of 15 near neighbors of Y. pestis were tested using the assay. each was correctly identified and differentiated from the Y. pestis signatures. genus-specific primer pairs targeting the asd (BCT2328) and galE (BCT2332) genes are expected to generate amplicons from all known members of the Francisella genus. both primer pairs are expected to generate amplicons from all known members of the Francisella genus. 57 reference isolates were tested from the USAMRIID. included were members of all phylogenetic lineages within the Francisella biocluster. all 34 Type A.I subspecies yield identical base compositions. the genus Vibrio represents a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria. at least 12 species are known human pathogens, and several other species are known to be pathogenic. three primer pairs from the pan-Vibrio assay were used. one amplifies the toxin gene ctxA. the third primer pair, targeted to gapA gene, was designed to amplify most of the known species. the information content within amplicons from BCT1070 and BCT1071 is basically the same, and this feature is meant as a built-in redundancy check for speciation calls. some B. pseudomallei strains provide the same signature as B. mallei, but the next closest relative, B. thailandensis, is clearly segregated. four additional species have been described, including two that infect marine mammals. the current convention recommends re-approval of the classical Brucella species with their recognized biovars. in the biothreat assay, members of the Brucella biocluster are identified. clostridia are classified into five types on the basis of its ability to produce one or more of the major lethal toxins, alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota. the clostridia are identified using two primer pairs, BCT1075 and BCT1076, targeting RNase P. the closest known organism based on genomic and 16S rRNA analysis is Legionella pneumophila [36]. the closest known organism based on genomic and 16S rRNA analysis is Legionella pneumophila [36]. the genus Rickettsia is divided into three main groups: R. prowazekii, R. typhi, and the \u201cspotted fever\u201d group of rickettsiae. the latter group includes R. conorii, the cause of tick typhus in the Mediterranean area and in India. the majority of these serotypes belong to a single Salmonella species, Salmonella enterica, which includes six subspecies. for Shigella, there are four species (Shigella dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei); all can cause enteric illnesses. this strain is considered the immediate ancestor of the E. coli O157:H7 lineage. this strain contains the shiga toxin, which is atypical for other E. coli strains. the salmonella species are divided into several clusters, but cannot be grouped according to the subspecies nomenclature based on data from this assay. in order to provide additional separation between E. coli and Shigella species, we added two more primer pairs targeting two different regions of two of the three primer pairs described previously were used in the biothreat assay and have been tested against a broad panel Alphavirus isolates representing both the Old and New World Alphavirus. the primer pair VIR966 exhibited the greatest breadth of coverage. the two provide species-level resolution of the genus Orthopoxvirus. the two differentiate the Variola and monkeypox viruses from each other and from vaccinia, rabbitpox, and ectromelia viruses. influenza A viruses cause serious global economic and public health burdens. two instances of avian H9N2 sharing base composition overlap with one or more of the avian H5N1 clusters. in both cases, all the overlapping strains were from local outbreaks. similar correlations were found for pandemic 2009 H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 viruses as previously described. primer pairs were assembled into a single assay kit containing groups of two to three primer pairs per well. each well included a synthetic DNA calibrant that was amplified by one of the target primer pairs. this calibrant served as a PCR positive control and allowed relative determination of the quantity of the target organism as previously described. fivefold serial dilutions of nucleic acid samples were prepared. samples were also tested in DNA elution buffer (TE buffer) alone. presumptive LOD was ascribed to be the lowest concentration. additional replicates were analyzed to allow for sufficient data to determine the LOD. the LOD for the threat agents tested in the context of environmental air background ranged from 40 to 1000 GE/well. it was found that 37.5% (6/16) of the agents tested had LODs of 40 GE/well, 50% (8/16) had LODs of 200 GE/well and 12.5% (2/16) had LODs of 1000 GE/well. i 1000 100% 96/96 0% 3.3% Salmonella enterica 40 100% 95/96 1% 4.9% Shigella flexneri 200 100% 96/96 0% 3.3% VEE 200 100% 96/96 0% 3.3% Vibrio cholerae 40 100% 95/97 2% 6.3% Y. pestis 40 100% 95/97 1% 4.9% Specificity. over 1000 samples containing environmental background without a specific target agent were analyzed and used to calculate false positive rates for each bacterial signatures include alphaproteobacteria such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. these might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. higher background prevalence of some of the potential biothreat agents in certain regions of the world might similarly affect other detections. the PLEX-ID biothreat assay did not discriminate between B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. ovis. this detection was reported by the Coxiella primer pairs, not the rickettsial primer pairs. pseudomallei burkholderia cepaciae (1000 GE/well) NN B. cepacia/cenocepacia/Burkholderia sp. 383 Clostridium botulinum/sporogenes Clostridium difficile (1000 GE/well) NN Clostridium perfringens (400 GE/well) BT Clostridium perfringens (400 GE/well) NN Coxi NN Multiple Klebsiella sp Multiple Escherichia sp Salmonella enterica (80 GE/well) BT Salmonella enterica/salamae 3 Klebsiella pneumonia (200 GE/well) NN 1 Indicates inability to differentiate the species further. 2 Brucella is identified at the genus level in this assay. anthracis Vollum 1B BT BACI126 B. anthracis Pakistan SK-102 BT BACI123 B. anthracis RA3 BT BACI228 B. cereus 3A NN BACI232 B. cereus G9241 NN BACI020 B. coagulans 7050 NN BURK003 B. pseudomallei 1026B BT BOTB C. botulinum B BT FRAN017 F. tularen linearity of response of the biothreat assay is referred to as linearity. the total GE reported by PLEX-ID was plotted against the actual concentration. other organisms were linear up to the maximum concentration tested. biothreat clusters targeted by this assay are shown in Figure 1. these organisms make up the majority of the NIAID category A, B, and C priority pathogens and HHS/USDA select agents. these organisms are phylogenetically related to other ubiquitous organisms.

Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) each isolate was correctly identified by comparison of base composition signatures obtained in the biothreat assay. the infB locus provided identical signatures across all B. anthracis strains tested.

[34 25 21 25] [42 23 23 21] [40 2 B. anthracis and near-neighbor organisms were also tested. none of these carried the virulence plasmids pXO1 or pXO2. the amplicon for sspE showed a 6-bp deletion compared to the B. anthracis signatures. the infB signature was the same length but had a different base composition. several studies have looked at the fine structure of the B. cereus clade. two specific markers within the Y. pestis genome were identified. one is located in the valyl-tRNA synthetase gene (valS) this region has a SNP that is retained in all the Y. pestis genomes studied to date. a second primer pair was designed to target the invasin gene invA. virulent strains such as Y. pestis Angola (PLA+/CAF) and pestoides F (PLA/CAF+) were correctly identified. a set of 15 near neighbors of Y. pestis were tested using the assay. each was correctly identified and differentiated from the Y. pestis signatures. ensis subsp. holarctica (type B) is less virulent and found in Europe and in Asia. the near-neighbor species F. novicida and F. philomiragia cause disease only in immunocompromised humans. the subspecies mediaasiatica is reported to be closer to the Type A.II lineage, even though its pathogenicity is characteristic of the Type B strains. the subspecies mediaasiatica is reported to be closer to the Type A.II lineage. the species outlier, F. philomiragia, was clearly different from the rest of the species outlier in both primer regions. the asd primer pair produced the expected amplicon for all strains of F. philomiragia. cholera are caused by toxigenic strains of the serogroups O1 and O139. non-toxigenic strains cause sporadic cases of disease. other important pathogens in this group cause significant morbidity worldwide. burkholderia biocluster is identified in the biothreat assay by two primer pairs, BCT1070 and BCT1071. the primer sets amplify conserved regions of the RNA component of ribonuclease P (RNAse P) and regions CR-IV and CR-V that bracket the highly variable extension P19. some B. pseudomallei strains provide the same signature as B. mallei. taxonomists have alternated between individual species naming and naming as a single species B. melitensis, containing B. melitensis 16M and five other biovars. recently, four additional species of Brucella have been described, including two that infect marine mammals. most of the clostridia are saprophytes, but a few are pathogenic in humans, primarily Clostridium botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and C. tetani. the clostridia are highly toxigenic to humans. most strains of C. tetani and the opportunistic clinical pathogen C. difficile form unique groups. other clostridia that are rarely human pathogens are clearly differentiated from all the above. genus Rickettsia prowazekii is a family of obligate intracellular small Gram-negative coccobacilli that infect humans chiefly through insect vectors. the rickettsial fevers are acute bacteremic illnesses characterized by headache, mental confusion, and, in severe cases, meningoencephalitis. enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella, Salmonella enterica) are closely related organisms that are ubiquitous food and water-borne pathogens. these agents have the potential to cause significant damage to the food supply and are high-risk clinical pathogens. the base count clusters shown in Table S14 demonstrate the ability of this primer pair to amplify members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. this primer pair provides species-level differentiation of Salmonella from E. coli and Shigella. this is consistent with the previously described phylogenetic relationship of these bacteria. some new world Alphavirus, such as the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) complex, are considered bioweapons. other important members of this virus group include the western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) complex viruses. pan-Orthopoxvirus assay based on four PCR reactions targeting orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. the assay can detect and identify diverse orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information, and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox virus-infected rabbits. influenza viruses cause serious global economic and public health burdens. identification of each influenza A virus is based on the summation of base composition signatures obtained from the six to eight primer pairs. the majority of these could be grouped into the six base composition clusters as shown in Table S18. the clusters were unique and distinct from other avian and non-avian signatures. we used modified nucleotides in the PCR primer pairs as previously described for the detection of the SARS coronavirus. in all cases, we obtained the base composition signature expected based on sequenced genomes of these viruses. due to highly pathogenic nature of these viruses, these viruses were not used in any additional analytical characterization studies described below. the primers used for the detection of these two plasmids were chosen to capture a previously described single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). this region provides two different alleles that can be used to distinguish non-pathogenic, vaccine, fully virulent, and genetically modified strains of B. anthracis. each isolate was correctly identified by comparison of base composition signatures obtained in the biothreat assay with genomic sequence data obtained from GenBank. an additional 89 strains of B. anthracis were obtained from the Keim Genetics Lab. the diverse strains in this collection were correctly identified in our assay.

Y. pestis is classified as a biothreat agent. it is a nonmotile, capsulated, Gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans and susceptible animals through flea bites or aerosols. other species in this biocluster include Y. enterocolitica, Y. frederiksenii, Y. ruckeri, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. y. pestis harbors plasmids that are required for the expression of virulence [23]\u2013[26]. primer pairs targeted against the pla gene from the pPCP1 plasmid of Y. pestis and the caf1 gene from the pMT1 plasmid of Y. pestis were included in the assay. F. tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia, a disease that affects humans and other mammals. the natural reservoir is thought to be lagamorphs and rodents with ticks as the primary vector [27], [28]. the near-neighbor species are of low pathogenicity and cause disease only in immunocompromised humans. both of these primer pairs are expected to generate amplicons from all known members of the Francisella genus. a homogenous signature was observed for all type A.I strains. the rest of the Francisella signatures are defined here as variations compared to this reference strain. tica strains had signatures that differed from the Type A.I subspecies in both primer pairs. signatures were consistent with the genome sequence of Francisella subsp. tularensis strain WY96-3128. however, two of the Type B strains tested, FRAN041 (Strain JAP-Cincinnati) and FRAN011 (Strain LR) could not be distinguished from the Type A.II subspecies. genus Vibrio cholerae is a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria. it contains at least 65 described species, most of which are found exclusively in aquatic environments. at least 12 species are known human pathogens, and several others are known to be pathogenic to marine mammals and fish. a subset of samples collected in 2006 from freshwater lakes and sites along the Georgian coast of the black sea were tested. six different Vibrio species were detected and identified in 13 of the 19 natural water samples spanning the seasons summer to winter. a notable exception is the polychlorinated biphenyl reducer B. xenovorans, which shows the same mass signature as B. pseudomallei str. 668. the occurrence of B. pseudomallei, which occupies a distinct ecological niche, is quite rare. clostridium botulinum/perfringens The genus Clostridium consists of relatively large, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria in the phylum Firmicutes. most of the clostridia are saprophytes, but a few are pathogenic in humans. the clostridia are identified using two primer pairs, BCT1075 and BCT1076, targeting RNase P. the two primer pairs are capable of amplifying all members of the genus Clostridium and differentiate the major species. Types A, B1, and F form a unique group and are distinguishable from all other clostridia. we use primers targeting isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd) and insertion sequence IS1111A transposase. the latter occurs in multiple copies in the bacterium (from 5 to 31 copies) NM, Dugway, K, and Q share identical signatures in both amplified regions. these primer pairs do not amplify Legionella and should not amplify nucleic acids from any of the other proteobacteria. organisms in the Rickettsia biocluster are identified by two primer pairs, BCT1083 and BCT1084, which prime different regions of the RNA component of the RNase P. the primers target Rickettsia-specific sequences, but no amplification is expected outside the Rickettsiaceae family. enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) can cause enteric illnesses. two primer pairs targeted two different regions of invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) these two primer pairs amplify all Shigella species but do not amplify E. coli or Salmonella. this assay does not distinguish between the various Shigella species. all the Alphavirus samples tested were detected with at least the VIR966 pair. most were identified to strain or subtype level. genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses. in April 2009, a previously unseen virus emerged and rapidly spread globally leading to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. the continuous evolution of influenza genomes together with reassortment events pose challenges to the effective monitoring of influenza viruses. Filovirus Filoviridae is a viral family of negative-strand RNA viruses that include two major genera, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus. some of the species in these groups include Sudan, Reston, Zaire, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus and several strain variants of the lake Victoria marburgvirus. data analysis and reporting for this assay were optimized for detecting the targeted biothreat clusters. the criteria for inclusion in this report are the detection of the biothreat cluster organisms in one or more primer pairs targeting individual clusters. the primer pairs targeting the plasmid markers are reported separately. the presumptive LOD was ascribed to be the lowest concentration. additional replicates were analyzed (as many as 105) to allow sufficient data to determine the LOD with a 95% confidence interval. these measured LODs were used for subsequent analysis. Detection and identification of all the threat agents relies on more than one primer pair; in case of B. anthracis, it relies on four primer pairs. false negative rates were calculated based on a failure to detect the threat organism. over 1000 samples containing environmental background without a specific target agent were analyzed and used to calculate false positive rates for each agent. a total of 1,353 samples in an environmental air background were analyzed during the determination of sensitivity. each sample contained only two of the agents under investigation. the PLEX-ID biothreat assay measured as false positive rates. the threat organism was correctly identified by the PLEX-ID system. ttsia canadensis was included during testing of the Rickettsial primer pairs. the PLEX-ID clearly demonstrated the ability to detect threat agents in the presence of both background and excess near-neighbor nucleic acids.

presumptive LOD was ascribed to be the lowest concentration. additional replicates were analyzed to allow for sufficient data to determine the LOD. the LOD for the threat agents tested in the context of environmental air background ranged from 40 to 1000 GE/well. it was found that 37.5% (6/16) of the agents tested had LODs of 40 GE/well, 50% (8/16) had LODs of 200 GE/well and 12.5% (2/16) had LODs

such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. these might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. higher background prevalence of some of the potential biothreat agents in certain regions of the world might similarly affect other detections. the PLEX-ID biothreat assay did not discriminate between B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. ovis. this detection was reported by the Coxiella primer pairs, not the rickettsial primer pairs. seudomallei burkholderia cepaciae (1000 GE/well) NN B. cepacia/cenocepacia/Burkholderia sp. 383

tularensis LVS var palearctica NN FRAN012 F linearity of response of the biothreat assay is referred to as linearity. the total GE reported by the PLEX-ID was plotted against the actual concentration. other organisms were linear up to the maximum concentration. the biothreat assay described here identifies ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters included in the NIAID priority pathogen list. the assay also identifies a broad range of near-neighbor organisms that may cause severe disease in humans or animals. the biothreat assay is universally conserved, essential to microbial life. biothreat assay enables very high-throughput sample analysis. the theoretical maximum throughput of the biothreat assay is approximately 180 specimens over 24 hours. the orthopoxvirus primers were used to amplify a panel of 36 virus isolates representing characterized Old World and New World Alphavirus. a naturally occurring organism with significantly lower virulence than F. tularensis subsp. tularensis subsp. tularensis. the biothreat assay would immediately identify this organism as a near neighbor of a biothreat agent. the results were confirmed with conventional PCR. the pan-bacterial assay would be used routinely in clinical diagnostics. if potential biothreat agents were detected, the biothreat assay would be used to provide detailed analysis. the multiplexed assay was tested with environmental air from Biowatch filters. the levels of organisms determined using the biothreat assay indicate the approximate genome equivalents/well for the target organism. at higher target organism concentrations, the calibrant is often outcompeted in the PCR reaction, therefore the reported levels at the higher loads were inaccurate. a specific RT-PCR assay targeting a single organism might be able to provide a measurement over a much larger linear range. eluent was shaken in a biospec mini beadBeater-96 with ATL buffer (Qiagen), Herring Sperm DNA, Proteinase K, and antifoam for 5

PCR was performed in a 50 L reaction volume containing 5 L nucleic acid extract in a reaction mix as previously described. each sealed plate was heat-sealed with foil on a Thermo Scientific ALPS microplate heat sealer (Rockford, IL) each sealed plate was loaded onto a mastercycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) and PCR-amplified under the following conditions. the PLEX-ID platform analyzes one PCR reaction every 30 seconds in a fully automated modality. the carousel is comprised of 22 identical spin cuvette modules in which the analyte solution is purified prior to ESI-MS analysis. each of the threat clusters is treated independently and the results are reported separately. the Q-Score is based on a number of different parameters. the multi-primer joint log likelihood ratio is an indicator of how well the hypothesized organisms as a group represent the observed data. the fraction of missed detections represents the percentage of primers for a detected organism for which no known data exists within the PLEX-ID system. nucleic acids were eluted from the environmental matrix by placing DFUs in 20 ml PBS/0.2% Triton X-200 and manually shaking. the eluent was then shaken in a Biospec Mini BeadBeater-96 with ATL buffer (Qiagen), Herring Sperm DNA, Proteinase K, and antifoam for 5 min. samples were incubated for 21 min at 16\u00b0C and then centrifuge PCR was performed in a 50 L reaction volume containing 5 L nucleic acid extract in a reaction mix as previously described. each sealed plate was heat-sealed with foil on a Thermo Scientific ALPS microplate heat sealer (Rockford, IL) each sealed plate was loaded onto a mastercycler Pro thermocycler and PCR-amplified under the following conditions. the PLEX-ID platform analyzes one PCR reaction every 30 seconds in a fully automated modality. the carousel is comprised of 22 identical spin cuvette modules in which the analyte solution is purified prior to ESI-MS analysis. the carousel rotates by one position facilitating the aspiration/or dispensation of the requisite reagents. the multi-primer single log likelihood ratio is an indicator of how significant the contribution of a single organism is to the solution. the fraction of missed detections represents the percentage of primers for a detected organism for which no known data exists within the PLEX-ID system. for the biothreat assay described here, a Q-score 0.85 is considered a reportable result. each PCR well includes a synthetic nucleic acid template that serves as a calibrant. each biothreat cluster is listed separately. Detection of an organism within a cluster is listed at the species level. the signatures that are bolded or italicized indicate a SNP variation compared to the predominant signature.
