{"summary": "natural models lack this human \u201cdesign\u201d element but historically the differences may enhance understanding of disease causality and management. it is however unusual for a single animal to provide more than 1 natural model for disease[1] hypotheses of hepatic metastases in humans Cancers of the colon and rectum comprise 14.5% of all cancers diagnosed in the united states (149880) and 11.1% of cancer deaths (51710) each year[10]. primary treatment for large bowel cancer is surgery. colorectal cancer is associated with chronic inflammation. inflammatory cytokines can be induced by interaction of terminally differentiated macrophages with the cancer associated glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) [14] CEA is a large heavily glycosylated glycoprotein of indeterminate function in the normal tissue in which it is expressed. the discovery of CEA in 1965 marked a turning point in the study of cancer and led what might be called the age of tumor markers. CEA was found not to be cancer specific and high false positive and false negative rates precluded its use in early detection of cancer. CEA is a useful marker in the determination of prognosis[27] and for detection of recurrence in the post-surgical follow up of colorectal cancer patients[28]. high levels of CEA are also associated with malignant ascites from colorectal cancer. the hnRNP group of proteins are multifunctional and are involved in many cellular events including alternative splicing, translational regulation and packaging of transcripts. the longer form also binds CEA in HT-29 colon cancer cells. it has been suggested that it may be involved with resistance afforded to anoikis. adhesion molecules on hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells seem to be E-selectin and ICAM-1. IL-6 and IL-8 are pro-angiogenesis and they may also effect growth at the distant site[14,42]. low-Marchelli et al[48] have shown that CCL2 recruits macrophages to promote angiogenesis. we suggest that colon cancer cells recruit macrophages by secreting MCP-1 and these macrophages are activated by tumor derived tumor derived CEA to secrete IL-6 and IL-8 both known pro-angiogenic factors. fibulin-5 is the newest member of the fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. hepatic metastasis of colorectal carcinoma is mediated by binding of extracellular matrix components to cell surface receptors. tens of thousands of CTT were imported by the pharmaceutical industry. interest, primate research in the u.s. is in decline with the closures of the ORAU (Oak Ridge Associated Universities) facility and that of the NEPC (New England Primate Center) which housed a significant proportion of CTT. the waning of public support and therefore funding opportunities combined with the expense of operations has largely been the cause of this decline. fibulin-5 is the newest member of the fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. hepatic metastasis of colorectal carcinoma is mediated by binding of extracellular matrix components to cell surface receptors. tens of thousands of CTT were imported by the pharmaceutical industry. despite this interest, primate research in the u.s. is in decline with the closures of the ORAU (Oak Ridge Associated Universities) facility and that of the NEPC (New England Primate Center) which housed a significant proportion of CTT. the waning of public support and therefore funding opportunities combined with the expense of operations has largely been the cause of this decline. observational study showed only 1.2% of animals had hepatic metastases[56]. the risk of cancer deaths shows an increase from 3-8 years and then a gradual decline after age 12 similar to the recently described risk in humans with positive family history of CRC[57]. on 4 and 15[58] Early adenoma/indefinite dysplasia Aneuploidy, methylation, Sialyl Tn Aneuploidy, methylation, Sialyl Tn, MSI 90%diploid; no methylation[59] Early promotor MSI; kRAS, COX-2 DCC kRAS absent[60] Late promoter p53 APC p53 ND; as above for APC exon 4 and the human kallikrein zymogens (hK2) closely related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) have been studied in the CTT[65]. they concluded that the CTT has no functional hK2 or PSA. this may be a knock-out model for the study of this topic. we tested other antigens such as organ specific neoantigen[71], thought to be the mediator of the lymphocyte adherence inhibition test for cancer and found reactivity[72]. in the early 1990\u2019s Karel Kithier was beta-testing a CEA kit produced by Tosoh Medics (CEA-AIA PACK kitTM) the results were expanded and confirmed and found to yield similar levels in CTT and humans. lane 5 contains positive human CEA control, and the M, markers (M) are in lane 6. arrow indicates the M, - 50000 band evident also in human extract (lane 5) likely a deglycosylated moiety. a control blot using T84.1EC monoclonal did not recognize the 50 kDa shared antigen in the same samples. h MedicsTM kit and T84.66 antibody were able to demonstrate a faint high MW band in a specimen of colonic washing from a CTT by immunoblot. we found that the concentration of CEA in washings was sevenfold times higher than in washings from humans with IBD. noma antigen (Adnab-9) were not. this supported the notion that carcinogenesis was likely de novo. the adenoma-carcinoma sequence did not progress through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. the rate of Ka (indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene) nonsynonymous mutations for this radiation is 7X higher than the average Ka in primates. this led us to postulate that if such mutations occur at the C-terminus, it is quite feasible that similar mutations occur at the N-terminus where they may affect uptake of CEA. CM had the PELPK mutations to a lesser extent (73% vs 29%, P 0.05) sequence changes in the PELPK binding motif are found in the CTT that prevent binding to CEAR and do not allow activation of Kupffer cells.

LS174T produces large amounts of CEA and has a high metastatic potential to the liver[99] aptamers are also being used for radiolocalization of CEA producing tumors. wich, Steven Itzkowitz and James Allard were peerless. the tenacity and attention to detail by Karel Kithier and James Hatfield were legend."}
