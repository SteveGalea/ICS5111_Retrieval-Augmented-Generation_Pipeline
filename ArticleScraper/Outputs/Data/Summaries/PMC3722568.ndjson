{"summary": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a plasma glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation and acts as the carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII) the protein is either constitutively secreted into the plasma and subendothelium or is stored in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies or platelet granules. related protein (LRP-1) and other members of the LDL receptor family of proteins influence FVIII and VWF clearance. carbohydrate makes up approximately 20% of the mass of the mature VWF subunit. CLEC4M is organized into 4 domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a neck region, and a CRD. the neck region is highly polymorphic, containing VNTR of a highly conserved 23-amino-acid sequence, with a range of 4 to 9 repeats. we document the ability of CLEC4M to bind and internalize VWF, and to influence in vivo levels of VWF. VNTR polymorphism in exon 4 of CLEC4M was genotyped using the same polymerase chain reaction protocol as described previously. 10% of the samples were genotyped again by duplicate genotyping experiments. chimera binding was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc antibody (AbCam, Cambridge, MA) Alternatively, CLEC4M-Fc was coated at 10 g/mL, and VWF binding was detected with an anti-VWF\u2013horseradish peroxidase antibody (Dako) patients with type 1 VWD were defined as individuals with both a personal history of excessive mucocutaneous bleeding and plasma levels of VWF:Ag and/or VWF:RCo between 0.05 and 0.50 U/mL obtained on at least 2 occasions. the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Queen\u2019s University and for the Zimmerman PPG subjects. t tests or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey or Dunnett post hoc analysis were performed using GraphPad InStat software version 3.06 (La Jolla, CA) or SPSS version 16 (IBM, Armonk, NY) values are expressed as means standard error. human plasma-derived VWF (FVIII-free) was from Haematologic Technologies Inc (Essex Junction, VT) chimera proteins (10 g/mL) were preincubated with 1 mg/mL of mannan for 30 minutes at room temperature. hepatic expression of CLEC4M CLEC4M was induced through hydrodynamic liver gene transfer. the population was predominately Caucasian (75%). the most frequent alleles were VNTR 5 (28.6%), 6 (14.3%), and 7 (53.1%). only the VNTR 5, 6, and 7 are seen frequently; the analysis only examined these 3 alleles. the FBAT analysis was repeated, excluding individuals with known putative VWF mutations. there remains a significant excess transmission of VNTR 6 to unaffected individuals. a positive score indicates excess transmission of that allele to affected individuals. a negative score indicates an association of that allele with higher levels of the trait in question. we included only unrelated individuals (n = 392) from the type 1 VWD population. only alleles 5, 6, and 7 are frequent, with allele frequencies of 0.306, 0.151, and 0.495. in vitro binding of VWF to CLEC4M Soluble CLEC4M-Fc bound to immobilized Humate-P. CLEC4M-Fc also bound to FVIII-free human plasma-derived VWF. preincubation of CLEC4M-Fc with the mannose polymer, mannan, attenuated binding to all VWF preparations by approximately 50%. Binding of CLEC4M-Fc chimera to VWF was measured with a modified ELISA using immobilized VWF or CLEC4M-Fc. soluble VWF (10 g/mL) and soluble CLEC4M-Fc and DC-SIGN-Fc (10 g/mL) binding immobilized Humate-P (10 g/mL) was assessed. lutinin-binding assays were described in supplemental Methods. there was a 70% increase in binding of CLEC4M-Fc to de-O-glycosylated Humate-P (P =.041) and a 75% decrease in binding of CLEC4M-Fc to de-N-glycosylated Humate-P (P =.046) relative to control. cells were incubated with Humate-P (2 U/mL VWF) for 30 minutes. colocalization of VWF with CLEC4M is observed in yellow (merge) images are representative of 3 to 4 separate experiments. -CLEC4M complex undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis. levels of VWF in the cell lysate were quantified by ELISA. levels of VWF in the cell lysate were measured as a dose response. cells expressing the VNTR construct combination 4 and 9 had a 55% decrease in binding and internalization of VWF relative to cells expressing CLEC4M with 7 VNTR (P.001), whereas cells expressing CLEC4M combinations 4/6 and 4/7 had reduced VWF binding and internalization. differences in median fluorescence did not account for variance in VWF binding and internalization. mice in which 10% to 30% of hepatocytes are expressing CLEC4M showed a 46% decrease in plasma levels of VWF (P =.0094) however, no significant difference in plasma levels of the liver-synthesized glycoprotein factor X were observed. the most frequent alleles were VNTR 5 (28.6%), 6 (14.3%), and 7 (53.1%) the remaining alleles had frequencies of less than 5%. only the VNTR 5, 6, and 7 are seen frequently; the analysis only examined these 3 alleles. the minor allele (G) at rs868875 is significantly associated with the discrete trait of type 1 VWD. when mutation-positive cases are excluded, the minor allele (G) at rs868875 is significantly associated with the discrete trait of type 1 VWD (z score, 2.152; P =.031). only alleles 5, 6, and 7 are frequent, with allele frequencies of 0.306, 0.151, and 0.495 respectively. the SNP (rs868875) has a MAF of 0.315 in this subpopulation. the correlation of D\u2032 and r2 depends on the frequency of the alleles in question. soluble Humate-P bound to immobilized CLEC4M-Fc. CLEC4M-Fc also bound to FVIII-free human plasma-derived VWF. preincubation of CLEC4M-Fc with mannan attenuated binding to all VWF preparations by approximately 50%. binding of soluble VWF (10 g/mL) to immobilized Humate-P (10 g/mL) soluble CLEC4M-Fc and DC-SIGN-Fc (0.1-20 g/mL) binding. soluble CLEC4M-Fc and DC-SIGN-Fc binding immobilized Humate-P (10 g/mL) CLEC4M binds to VWF in an N-glycan\u2013dependant manner. binding of CLEC4M and DC-SIGN to rADAMTS13 (supplemental Data Set C) and BSA was used as positive and negative controls. cell-based studies for measuring VWF binding colocalized with CLEC4M expression. incubation of CLEC4M-expressing cells at 4\u00b0C maintained VWF (green) at the cell surface. incubation at 37\u00b0C facilitated internalization of VWF. CLEC4M-expressing cells bound and internalized VWF in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. levels of VWF in the cell lysate were measured as a dose response and as a time course. internalization of VWF was confirmed by incubating CLEC4M-expressing cells with 2 U of VWF for 24 hours. no difference in binding and internalization of VWF was seen in cells expressing 6 tandem repeats compared with cells with the 7 allele. differences in median fluorescence did not account for variances in VWF binding and internalization. hepatic expression of CLEC4M-Fc is associated with decreased plasma levels of VWF. CLEC4M-Fc binds recombinant VWF in a glycan-dependent manner. the minor allele at rs868875 was significantly associated with the discrete trait of type 1 VWD (z score, 2.152; P =.031) but remained nonsignificant for VWF:RCo and VWF:Ag. the effect of the rs868875 SNP in the mutation-negative subgroup is consistent with those reported in the CHARGE GWAS. the rare VNTR alleles 4, 8, and 9 were seen too infrequently in our population to be included in the association analysis. CLEC4M functions as a VWF clearance receptor by binding VWF and facilitating internalization and targeting to early endosomes. recombinant CLEC4M-Fc chimera bound to plasma-derived VWF-FVIII complex (Humate-P) in a dose-dependent manner. binding specificity was confirmed using FVIII-free human plasma-derived VWF (Figure 2C) and recombinant human VWF. the 2 proteins show 77% amino acid identity and are similar in structure with a cytoplasmic tail and a coiled neck region. both proteins have similar ligand profiles that include ICAM-3 and viral glyoproteins such as HIV-1 gp-120,22 HCV E2,44 and SAR-CoV. CLEC4M contributes to viral infectivity either in cis by receptor-mediated endocytosis47 or trans by presenting the virus to circulating T cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. in cell-based studies, CLEC4M binds VWF in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Figure 5B-C) it is not clear whether certain VNTR alleles or hetero-oligomer formation changes the affinity of CLEC4M binding to ligands. conflicting studies report that a minimal number of VNTR is necessary for tetramerization. some have reported that VNTR alleles 5, 6, and 7 tetramerize with comparable efficiency. the finding that CLEC4M\u2019s CRD is hinged, or flexibly linked to the neck region suggests that shear stress may have a significant impact on the interaction of VWF and CLEC4M. this investigation has extended previous genetic association evidence implicating the CLEC4M locus as a determinant of VWF plasma levels."}
