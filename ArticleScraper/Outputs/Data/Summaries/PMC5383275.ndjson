{"summary": "sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic hereditary disorder. it affects millions of people worldwide and is especially prevalent in people of africa and Asian descent. about 300,000 babies are born with the disease annually. carbon monoxide and nitric oxide have been associated with increased number of hospital admissions. zinc supplementation has been associated with decreased incidence of infections, number of hospitalizations, and vaso-occlusive pain crisis [12]. socioeconomic conditions and geographic location also play a role in the variation seen in SCD outcomes. we aim to use GIS technology to determine the environmental and social exposures of persons with SCD attending SCU. we hypothesize that patient factors such as sex and genotype and geo-social exposures will have an association with common clinical presentations in SCD such as pain crises, respiratory problems and leg ulcers. geocoded, spatial data layers attached to community and/or enumeration district data were created for further processing and analysis. mGI has access to 30-year meteorological records such as rainfall, mean temperature and surface elevation from their more than 300 monitoring stations island-wide. social, environmental and clinical variables were compared by sex, by mild/severe genotype and by rural/urban residence of participants. medians and frequencies were compared using two-sample t-test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the chi-squared test as applicable. logistic regression analyses were conducted to study predictors of common clinical outcomes, such as painful crises, respiratory events and leg ulcers. 2,407 (28.3%) resided in rural communities and 6,097 (71.7%) in urban centres. about 43.6% of patients were registered at the SCU before their 5th birthday and another 35.8% registered between 5 and 18 years of age. 65.6 0.001 Annual Pain events rate,(mean SD) 0.42, 0.75(n = 4234) 0.34, 0.58(n = 1344) 0.40, 0.70 0.06 History of respiratory events, % Yes 21.2 14.0 19.1 0.001 Annual respiratory illness rate (median,IQR) 0.17, 0.36(n = 1290) 0.16, 0.37(n = 336) 0.16, 0.36 0.13 History of leg ulcers. males lived further from a sickle cell clinic (mean distance: 21.3 vs. 20.5 kms; p value: 0.035); had higher annual visits to the clinic (mean visits: 3.2 vs. 3.0; p value: 0.008) and had higher prevalence of respiratory events (52.5% in males vs. 47.5% in females; p value0.001) and of leg ulcerations. 73.5% of rural patients versus 66.8% of urban patients had the more severe genotypes (p value 0.001) and rural patients had to travel significantly longer distances to access SCU services. rural patients had lower rates of total annual visits to the SCU. people living in higher poverty and those in rural areas had lower rates of annual health maintenance visits. people with more severe genotypes had higher rates of annual total visits as well as annual health maintenance visits. p value 0.001 *p0.05 **p0.001 1Reference category is \u2018Urban residence\u2019 2Reference category is \u2018Mild genotype\u2019 3Reference category is \u2018Males\u2019 Predictors of common clinical outcomes Table 3 reports on some social and environmental predictors of three common clinical outcomes. rural/urban residence was not predictive of leg ulcers. those with more severe genotypes had greater odds of having leg ulcers. females had 19% lower odds of history of respiratory events and 33% lower odds of having history of leg ulcerations. 0 thalassemia (%) 4035 (66.8) 1752 (73.5) 5787 (68.7) 0.001 Poverty index (median,IQR) 2, 13 24, 18 8, 20 0.001 Dependency Ratio (meanSD) 0.600.17 0.760.14 0.001 Ratio of SCD vs. general population, % (meanSD) 0.540.32 0.390.29 0.001 Distance from clinic, kilometers (meanSD) average elevation, kilometers (meanSD) 0.04, 0.08 0.18, 0.31 0.06, 0.14 0.001 Average rainfall, meters (median,IQR 1.1, 0.45 1.76, 0.57 1.25, 0.7 0.001 Distance from factories, kilometers (median,IQR) 0.80, 1.12 4.3, 4.8 1.2, 4.8 0.001 The mean ratio of SCD patients to general population by communities was 0.5% 0.3%. 68.7% of patients had the more severe genotypes (Hb SS and S0 thalassemia), 65.6% had suffered from significant pain crises, 21.7% had suffered from leg ulcers, and 19.1% had experienced some respiratory complication such as acute chest syndrome or asthma. those with severe genotypes had significantly higher experiences of pain crises (68.4% vs. 60.0%; p vale 0.001) and leg ulcers (28.8% vs. 6. more urban patients were registered to the SCU before the age of 5 years. there were no differences in annual health maintenance visits for the two groups. rural patients had lower rates of total annual visits to the clinic.
