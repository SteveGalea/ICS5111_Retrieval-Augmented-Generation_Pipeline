{"summary": "members of the family Filoviridae are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. nothing is known about the pathogenicity of the not yet isolated Cuevavirus (1, 2). there is one known species of Marburgvirus, Marburg marburgvirus, consisting of two viruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus. EBOV GP is known to interact with membrane-anchored cellular C-type lectins (e.g., DC-SIGN) mainly through its mucin-like domain. infection is initiated by binding of GP to attachment factors, such as C-type lectins, followed by internalization of the virus particle into endosomes via macropinocytosis (14\u201316). TIM-4 and Axl (a receptor tyrosine kinase) have been shown to promote infection of several different enveloped viruses in a manner independent of specific receptor recognition by their envelope glycoproteins. however, TIM-1 enhances infection, whereas for Lassa virus, herpes simplex virus 1, influenza A virus (H7N1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus it does not (27, 28, 30) vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Indiana serotype) were propagated on vero E6 cells. all infectious work with filoviruses was performed in the biosafety level 4 laboratories. infectivities of VSV bearing filovirus GPs or VSV G were determined. splenocytes were fused with B-cell myeloma cells according to standard procedures (34) the antibody did not bind to EBOV GP in immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. MAb M224/1 and a control MAb were purified from mouse ascites using the Affi-Gel protein A MAPS II kit (Bio-Rad) cells infected with VSV were fixed 8 h postinfection and stained with a mixture of anti-VSV G(N)1-9 (33) and anti-VSV M 195-2 (12) as primary antibodies. anti-rabbit IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029; Invitrogen) as secondary antibodies. the cells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029; Invitrogen) and positively stained cells were collected using a moFlo Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) the collected cells were propagated until 1 106 cells were obtained for the next cell sorting. 293T cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin, washed with cold PBS\u20132% FCS. primary antibody binding was detected with anti-goat IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 647 (305-606-047; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) the membranes of purified VLPs were labeled with a lipophilic tracer, 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (Invitrogen) the cells were then incubated with phenol red-free MEM (Invitrogen)\u20132% FBS\u20134% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing either 50 g/ml MAb cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature. cells were stained with goat anti-TIM-1 polyclonal antibody (AF1750; R&D Systems), goat anti-NPC1 MAb (ab55706; Abcam) and goat IgG (731635; Beckman Coulter) for 1 h. cells were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029; Invitrogen) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 h. the cellular localization of TIM-1 and NPC1 was analyzed using an LSM 780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss) 293T cells were cotransfected with complementary pair of mKG fusion plasmids. cells with fluorescent signals derived from complemented mKG molecules accumulated in cells were counted using flow cytometry. cells were incubated with 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 reagents. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was propagated on vero E6 cells and stored at 80\u00b0C. all infectious work with filoviruses was performed in biosafety level 4 laboratories. 293T, Plat-GP, and Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. both media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin. splenocytes were fused with B-cell myeloma cells according to standard procedures. cells infected with filoviruses were fixed and stained with a mixture of anti-GP (anti-EBOV 42/3.7 or anti-MARV FS0505) (35, 36) and anti-NP (anti-EBOV 74/7 or anti-MARV FS0609) as primary antibodies and anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029; Invitrogen) as secondary antibodies. Virus infection was quantified by measuring the number of fluorescent Plat-GP cells were cotransfected with pMX containing cDNA library genes and a VSV G-expressing plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) two days later, culture supernatants were collected and cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min and by passing through 0.45-m-pore filters. retroviruses were cotransfected with pMXs-IG encoding Vero E6 TIM-1, its IgV domain deletion mutant, or DC-SIGN cDNAs and an expression plasmid for VSV G using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) two days later, the retroviruses were collected in the culture supernatants, clarified through 0.45-m-pore filters, and then infect 293T and Jurkat T cells. the culture supernatant was harvested 48 h posttransfection. the cells were incubated with phenol red-free MEM (Invitrogen)\u20132% FBS\u20134% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing either 50 g/ml MAb M224/1, 50 g/ml MAb M224/1. anti-TIM-1 polyclonal antibody (AF1750; R&D Systems), 20 mM NH4Cl, or 100 M 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a macropinocytosis inhibitor. cells were then incubated with or without antibodies or inhibitors at room temperature for 30 min. no appreciable difference in total number of internalized VLPs across the conditions (15) cells were washed 3 times with PBS and stained with goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 594 (A11058; Invitrogen) after being washed 3 times, cells were then stained with goat anti-mouse IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029; Invitrogen) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 h. two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and treated with lysis buffer. the next day, the beads were washed three times with wash buffer. expression plasmids for TIM-1\u2013mKG(C) and NPC1-mKG(N) were generated. 293T cells transfected with mKG fusion plasmids were incubated with cellLight Early Endosomes-RFP reagents (C10587; Life Technologies) for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. RESULTS Anti-TIM-1 MAb M224/1 blocks filovirus entry into vero E6 cells. a limited effect was observed on EBOV and VSVG-EBOV GP infection of Jurkat T cells that are poorly permissive for filovirus infections. expression of TIM-1 in 293T cells dramatically enhanced susceptibility of cells to EBOV and VSVG-EBOV GP infection. EBOV supernatant was collected 48 h postinfection, and viral titers were determined by performing the 50% tissue-culture-infective dose (TCID50) assay (52). luciferase activities of pseudotyped VSVs were measured 24 h postinfection. each experiment was performed three times. MAb did not show any inhibitory effects, even at the highest concentration tested (100 M) these results indicated that this antibody blocked the entry step of filovirus GP-mediated infection by MAb M224/1. infected cells were stained with virus-specific antibodies and counted. the relative percentage of infected cells was determined by setting the number of untreated cells to 100%. compared the number of bound particles on cell surface in the presence of MAb M224/1. a slight reduction of VLP internalization was observed in MAb M224/1-treated cells. fewer VLPs were detected in cells treated with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a macropinocytosis inhibitor. quantification of the size and intensity of the DiI fluorescent dots confirmed that their average size and intensity were reduced in MAb M224/1-treated cells compared to untreated cells. these results suggest that MAb M224/1 primarily prevents membrane fusion. cytoplasm were observed in the same focal plane by confocal laser scanning microscopy. scale bars represent 20 m. TIM-1 interacts with NPC1. it has been suggested that EBOV membrane fusion occurs in late endosomes and/or lysosomes following the interaction of GP with NPC1. TIM-1 and NPC1 were mostly colocalized in intracellular vesicles in vero E6 cells. TIM-1\u2013FLAG and NPC1-HA were expressed in 293T cells. TIM-1\u2013FLAG was coprecipitated with TIM-1\u2013FLAG captured by anti-HA antibody. 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding TIM-1\u2013FLAG and/or NPC1-HA were visualized with specific antibodies and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. mKG expression was remarkably decreased in MAb M224/1-treated cells and that the number of mKG expression was remarkably decreased. 293T cells were incubated with different concentrations of 3,000 M MAb M224/1 or the control antibody. mKG-positive cells were reduced by the antibody treatment in a dose-dependent manner. cells in MAb M224/1-treated cells are presented as percentage of inhibition compared to the number of mKG-positive cells treated with the control antibody. each experiment was performed four times and the results are presented as the mean. Error bars represent SD. Significance was calculated using Student's t test (**, P 0.01). plasmids encoding NPC1-mKG(N) and TIM-1-mKG(C) were incubated for 30 min on ice. the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C and fixed with 4% PFA. the cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. MAb M224/1 recognized full-length TIM-1 on 293T cells. but not a mutant lacking its IgV domain (IgV), indicating that the IgV domain is important for the interaction with MAb M224/1. a limited effect was observed on infection with VSV bearing VSV G protein (VSVG-VSV G) jurkat T cells stably expressing vero E6-derived TIM-1 or DC-SIGN. EBOV supernatant was collected 48 h postinfection. luciferase activities of pseudotyped VSVs were measured 24 h postinfection. treatment with a control MAb did not show any inhibitory effects. treatment with a control MAb did not show any inhibitory effects. treatment with a control MAb blocked the entry step of filovirus infections. fluorescent (DiI)-labeled VLPs consisting of EBOV GP, VP40, and NP (44, 45) compared the number of bound particles on cell surface in the presence and absence of MAb M224/1. a slight reduction of VLP internalization was observed in MAb M224/1-treated cells, whereas an anti-TIM-1 polyclonal antibody effectively reduced VLP binding to cells. the diI signals in MAb M224/1-treated cells were considerably weaker than those in untreated cells. quantification of the size and intensity of the DiI fluorescent dots confirmed that their average size and intensity were reduced in MAb M224/1-treated cells compared to untreated cells. this suggests that MAb M224/1 primarily prevents membrane fusion. o E6 cells expressing GFP-Rab7 (green) were treated with MAb M224/1 or NH4Cl. scale bars represent 20 m. TIM-1 interacts with NPC1. it has been postulated that EBOV membrane fusion occurs in late endosomes. TIM-1 MAb M224/1 inhibited endosomal membrane fusion led us to hypothesize that TIM-1 might directly interact with NPC1. TIM-1 localized mainly in the endosomal and lysosomal membranes in vero E6 cells. intracellular TIM-1 (red) and NPC1 (green) in vero E6 cells were visualized with specific antibodies. nuclei of cells were visualized with DAPI (blue) mKG expression was remarkably decreased in MAb M224/1-treated cells. the number of mKG-positive cells was reduced by the antibody treatment in a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells were incubated with different concentrations of MAb M224/1 or the control antibody. reduced numbers of mKG-positive cells are presented as percentage of inhibition compared to the number of mKG-positive cells treated with the control antibody. each experiment was performed four times, and the results are presented as the mean. 293T cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding NPC1-mKG(N) and TIM-1-mKG(C) were incubated with DiI-labeled VLPs for 30 min on ice. the cells were then incubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C and fixed with 4% PFA. intracellular TIM-1 can be detected in early endosomes and lysosomes. TIM-1 is present in intracellular vesicles as well as on the cell surface. TIM-1 colocalized and directly interacted with NPC1. the proposed model for EBOV entry into cells includes several steps. the first step is GP-dependent (e.g., C-type lectins) or -independent (e.g., TIM-1) virus attachment. GP is cleaved in late endosomes by cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins. members of the TAM receptor family are expressed on the surfaces of macrophages and dendritic cells (47) and can indeed facilitate PtdSer-mediated virus uptake via indirect binding to PtdSer on the viral envelope (30, 48) TIM-1 IgV domain recognizes PtdSer exposed on apoptotic cells and facilitates virus attachment and uptake via a process known as apoptotic mimicry. ing the detailed structures of the intermolecular interface between MAb M224/1 and TIM-1 or TIM-1 and NPC1 may provide new insights into the development of antivirals."}
