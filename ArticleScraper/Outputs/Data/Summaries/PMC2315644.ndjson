{"summary": "production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. the development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks. the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a favored yeast species. it has the potential for high expression levels, efficient secretion of target proteins, posttranslational modifications, and is easily grown to high cell densities in bioreactors. pulse-based methanol addition for recombinant processes with P. pastoris is generally performed in bioreactors by the fed-batch strategy. the basic scheme follows in principle the original protocol of Brierley and coworkers [13] pO2 level-dependent manual feeding of methanol improves expression. the commonly used methanol feeding protocol for shake flask cultures of P. pastoris leads to long starvation phases between feeding pulses. a computer-controlled feeding device was developed, consisting of an encapsulated microcomputer which was connected to feeding valves. the microcomputer is controlled by a normal desktop computer over a radio-module working at 868 MHz. if needed, the feeding device can be powered by a rechargeable lead battery. the feeding strategy was based on the commonly used pulse-feeding method [10,12] in which a 5% methanol solution was fed twice a day to a final methanol concentration of 0.5% (v/v) within the first 2 hours a methanol pulse was given every 12 min and after that the feeding interval was 30 min. each methanol pulse was 0.8 ml of the 5% methanol solution. the pO2 level was stabilized to about 90% after 50 h of cultivation. only towards the end of the cultivation a low concentration of residual methanol could be detected in the medium. however, small amounts of methanol were present in the culture with quasi-continuous methanol addition. all cultures were followed by analysis of collagen II, C-P4H enzymatic activity and product-related mRNAs. the amount of type II collagen chains (139 kD) was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE after HCl extraction with pepsin-treatment. 109 72 1A 12.2 15.4 + ++ -
