{"summary": "renal and cardiac diseases are very common and often occur concomitantly, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. the findings are discussed in the context of available data suggesting protective roles for both enzymes in reno-cardiac diseases. 5\u201310% of the world population is affected by CKD. CKD prevalence will further increase due to rising prevalence of major risk factors for CKD including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. valsartan was not able to reduce proteinuria in the CHARM-Added study. a better understanding might be hampered by the extensive heterogeneity among patients with CKD with respect to pathomechanisms and concomitant diseases. gene ID CD number EC number Name Concentration (mM) Source Name (concentration (M)) Ref. leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP) LAP3 3.4.11.1 H-Leu-pNA-HCl 4.375 Sigma \u2013 Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase (APN) ANPEP CD13 3.4.11.2 H-Ala-pNA-HCl 2.925 Bachem RB3014 [1 107] Chen et angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ACE2 3.4.17.23 ACE color-Kit MAST-DIAGNOSTICA-GmbH Lisinopril [0.3 106] Lehmann et al.65 Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) PREP 3.4.21.26 H-Gly-Pro-pNA-HCl 1.65 Bachem Lys-Z-NO-thiazolidid [1 104 group 2 (CKD 3A; eGFR > 45\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2), group 3 (CKD 3B; eGFR > 30\u201345 ml/min/1.73 m2), group 4 (CKD 4; eGFR > 16\u201330 mL/min/1.73 m2), group 5 (CKD 5; eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2). IRAP, and DPP4 enzymatic activity were carried out in 50 mM Hepes buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 10 M ZnCl2 and 1% DMSO pH 6.8. enzyme reactions were performed in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates. matic activities are given in nkat/L and were calculated as follows: A = (E Vt)/(t d Vs)/L. Gani_Med was started in 2011, when creatinine measurements were performed with a modified kinetic Jaff\u00e9 method on the Siemens Dimension Vista (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany). eGFR groups 1\u20133 only very few samples were available in the CKD cohort. by design, samples from the cardiovascular cohort were selected randomly and matched by age and sex. in detail, two, 10, and 12 samples were added to eGFR groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. sensitivity analyses were performed to address potential non-linear relationships between the eGFR values and the protease activities. the results were adjusted for multiple testing by applying the false discovery rate (FDR) and claimed significant having an FDR 0.05. the number of patients in the CKD stages 1\u20133 was naturally low in the renal cohort patients. 24 age- and sex-matched patients from the GANI_MED \u201ccardiovascular cohort\u201d were selected to fill up these stages. each group comprised more than 25 patients. enzyme reactions were performed in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates. reaction volume amounting to 100 L consisted of 65 L buffer, 10 L serum and 25 L substrate. when appropriate, inhibitors were used to increase the specificity of the assays. Gani_Med was started in 2011, when creatinine measurements were performed with a modified kinetic Jaff\u00e9 method on the Siemens Dimension Vista (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany) in November 2012, a new, enzymatic method for creatinine measurement on the Siemens Dimension Vista was introduced in our lab. for this comparison, 327 plasma samples (0\u2013700 mol/L creatinine) were measured with each method. two, 10 and 12 samples were added to eGFR groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. the sample sizes per group after successful measurement of protease activities are presented in Table 2. enzymatic activity of ACE, ACE2, APA, APB, APN, LAP, PEP, PSA, IRAP, and DPP4 was determined from serum samples after one freeze\u2013thaw cycle using the substrates and inhibitors specified in Table 1. the enzymatic activity of ACE and ACE2 was determined using the ACE color-Kit (MAST-DIAGNOSTICA-GmbH, Reinfeld, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions adapted to 96-well plates, the lisinopril-insensitive fraction was considered as ACE2 activity. all samples were analyzed in duplicate. the eGFR was calculated using the four-variable MDRD equation. about 90% of subjects included in the present study have an eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, values at which the MDRD formula has a high accuracy. renal function was modeled either using the continuous eGFR values (eGFRcrea_MDRD), the groups, or dichotomized by eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (egfr_group15) or 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (egfr_group45), respectively. results were adjusted for multiple testing by applying the false discovery rate (FDR)24. eGFR groups showed the lowest ACE2 activity. a dichotomous analysis was performed to compare ACE2 protease activity. the results show a significantly higher ACE2 activity in patients with eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to that in patients with eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P 0.00016) the eGFR group 5 exhibited the highest serum activity levels of all groups. angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2; DPP4: dipeptidyl-peptidase 4; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate DPP4 and PEP were inversely correlated with age. none of the others proteases studied here showed significant age- or sex-dependent changes in serum activity. e alanyl-aminopeptidase (APN); leucine aminopeptidase 4; NPEPPS: leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase 3; NPEPPS: leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase 3; NPEPPS: aminopeptidase puromycine sensitive (PSA); PREP: prolyl endopeptidase (APB); F loss of ACE2 was shown to exacerbate experimental renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. loss of ACE2 was shown to exacerbate experimental renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. loss of ACE2 was shown to exacerbate experimental renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. higher serum ACE2 activity in patients with lower eGFR could represent a similar compensatory and protective mechanism aimed at counteracting disease-associated induction of the classical AngII/ACE/AT1R RAS axis. a recent study found lower ACE2 plasma activities in patients on hemodialysis when compared to CKD patients who do not require hemodialysis. l peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26, EC3.4.14.5) is a 110 kDa type II membrane protein. it is ubiquitously expressed with highest expression levels in kidney, spleen, and lung. it has been established as a T-cell activation marker44,45. vildagliptin suppressed albuminuria and reduced apoptosis of podocytes. inhibition of DPP4 by vildagliptin restored urinary flow, GFR, and proteinuria in a rat model of heart failure-induced renal dysfunction. DPP4 activity was defined as the fraction of Gly-Pro-pNA-hydrolyzing activity that could be inhibited by Lys-Z-nitro-thiazolidid, thereby excluding the non-inhibited fraction that rather represents PEP activity. the apparent discrepancy might be due to the application of a specific DPP4 inhibitor in our study. further analyses are warranted to identify the precise role of serum ectopeptidases in the pathogenesis of CKD. authors\u2019 contributions All authors participated in the design of the study, interpretation of data, and review of the manuscript."}
