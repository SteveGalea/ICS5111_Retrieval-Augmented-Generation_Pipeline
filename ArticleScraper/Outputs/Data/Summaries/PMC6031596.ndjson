{"summary": "clinical practice guidelines based on evidence-based medicine promote evidence-based, objective, and efficient medical practices. many evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have also been developed, including the treatment guideline for community-acquired pneumonia developed in 2009. guideline sets forth fundamental principles of antibiotic use against community-acquired pneumonia in adults aged 19 years or older. OVID-MEDLINE and OVID-EMBASE were used to search for foreign studies. KMBase and KoreaMed were used to search domestic studies. the qualities of these four clinical practice guidelines were assessed using an assessment scale developed by the Clinical Practice Guideline Expert Committee of the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences. a total of four clinical practice guidelines including a domestic guideline published in 2009 and a consensus guideline on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults were selected for review. this guideline will undergo minor revisions as soon as the revised versions of these guidelines are published. this guideline will also be revised every 4-5 years to reflect recent study results both outside and inside Korea. guideline development committee includes as many associated medical institutions as possible. guideline target and scope This guideline sets forth fundamental principles of antibiotic use against community-acquired pneumonia in adults aged 19 years or older. clinical practice guideline was developed using the adaptation method. 22 key questions (KQ) to be included in the guideline were selected. the key questions followed the population intervention, comparison, and outcome principle. the guideline was revised and improved based on what was discussed at the conferences. further revisions were made based on expert opinions gathered during a public hearing participated in by each related association to complete the guideline development. OVID-MEDLINE and OVID-EMBASE were used to search for foreign studies. KMBase and KoreaMed were used to search domestic studies. clinical practice guidelines were searched on NGC, G-I-N and KoMGI. a total of four clinical practice guidelines including a domestic guideline published in 2009 and a consensus guideline on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults were selected as adaptation targets. the guideline developed through internal meetings was presented in the spring academic conferences held by the Korean Society for Chemotherapy and the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases. study findings about the major causative bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia in Korea are summarized in Table 1. the most important causative bacteria of bacterial pneumonia are S. pneumoniae, which account for 27-69% of all causative bacteria of bacterial pneumonia. the ratio of Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa to be relatively high. studies have reported mixed infections caused by two or more microorganisms to be relatively common. these infections include mixed infections caused by atypical causative bacteria of pneumonia. Klebsiella pneumoniae 14 (11.5) 6 (5.7) 26 (19.8) 105 (18.5) 17 (8.9) 7 (2.8) 3 (4.8) 13 (20.6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa 11 (9.0) 11 (8.4) 83 (14.6) 22 (11.5) 2 (0.8) 2 (3.2) 4 (6.3) Legionella were especially more common for cases of moderate to severe pneumonia requiring ICU admission compared with other atypical pneumoco influenza virus was the most common (n = 23, 38%), followed by RSV (n = 9, 15%), rhinovirus (n = 7, 12%), coronavirus (n = 6, 10%), adenovirus (n = 6, 10%), metapneumovirus (n = 5, 8%), parainfluenza virus (n = 3, 5%). pneumonia caused by M. tuberculosis can occur as typical bacterial pneumonia. common causative bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia by epidemiological characteristics and risk factors. common causative bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia by epidemiological characteristics and risk factors. eudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus Use of intravenous medications S. aureus, anaerobes, M. tuberculosis, S. pneumonia Bronchial obstruction Anaerobes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus Table 3. Common clinical characteristics associated with specific causative bacteria. the revised standards deem the bacteria to be susceptible if MIC 2.0 g/mL, moderately resistant if MIC=4.0 g/mL, and highly resistant if MIC 8.0 g/mL. the current antibiotic resistance against pencilling drops to below 10%. study examined M. pneumoniae isolated from respiratory organ samples in 2000-2011. genes related to macrolide resistance were found in 17.6% of the samples. systematic research on the role of MRSA in community-acquired pneumonia is lacking. study findings about the major causative bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia in Korea are summarized in Table 1. the most important causative bacteria of bacterial pneumonia are S. pneumoniae. they account for 27-69% of all causative bacteria of bacterial pneumonia. these infections include mixed infections caused by atypical causative bacteria of pneumonia. distributions of the major causative bacteria may change depending on diseases and risk factors. mycoplasma, C. pneumoniae, and Legionella accounted for 6.3-9.2%, 7.1-13.2%, and 0.5-3% of all cases of pneumonia [11,12,13]. Respiratory virus induces pneumonia in children, as well as community-acquired pneumonia in adults. tsutsugamushi disease and leptospirosis are febrile illnesses that usually occur in the fall. pneumonia caused by C. burnetii in Korea must be differentiated with the possibility of febrile illnesses in mind. pneumonia by epidemiological characteristics and risk factors. common causative bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia by epidemiological characteristics and risk factors. pneumoniae female gender, alcohol addiction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dry cough Legionella pneumophila Relatively young female, smoker, having no underlying diseases, diarrhea, neurological symptoms, severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunctions (e.g. liver dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, etc.) antibiotic resistance against levofloxacin and moxifloxacin is reported at 0.8-8.2%, and 0.9-1.0%, respectively. resistance against ampicillin due -lactamase production is common in H. influenzae. PCR is more sensitive than the culture test, or the enzyme immunoassay test. this strength makes it advantageous for adult patients with a smaller number of nasopharyngeal virus compared with pediatric patients [31,32]. in 20-40% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, respiratory viruses are detected by PCR [34,35,36,37] positive results of upper airway samples do not necessarily indicate viral infection. however, positive PCR results do not indicate that pneumonia was caused by a respiratory virus. mycoplasma PCR Various serological tests have been traditionally used to diagnose Mycoplasma. these tests may fail to detect antibodies in the early period after infection [44,45], and IgM antibody reactions may not occur in adults aged 40 years or older [46]. PCR may be more useful than serological tests for diagnosing Chlmydophila infection. CT findings suggestive of mycobacteria that must be differentiated from common pneumonia, and of fungal lung infection can also be obtained [56,63,64] CT must be selectively performed in cases where differentiation of accompanying diseases such as pulmonary embolism is necessary, fungal infection is suspected, it is difficult to check for lung infiltration on chest X-rays. respiratory virus PCR Methods of respiratory virus testing include the culture test, rapid antigen test, immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay test, and PCR. PCR is more sensitive than the culture test, or the enzyme immunoassay test. this strength makes it advantageous for adult patients with a smaller number of nasopharyngeal virus compared with pediatric patients [31,32]. respiratory viruses are detected in 20% of patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. it is unclear whether the use of antiviral agents is necessary or not. it is difficult to diagnose viral pneumonia based on positive results only. a PCR Serological tests for Chlmydophila have lower specificity compared with PCR. the sensitivity of the Legionella PCR test using respiratory organ samples was 97.4%, and its specificity was 98.6%. Legionella PCR may be performed using nasopharyngeal samples. Chest CT is the most accurate test for assessing parenchymal anomalies. radiographic findings indicative of pneumonia may be observed even when no anomalies are observed on chest X-rays. CT findings suggestive of mycobacteria that must be differentiated from common pneumonia. chest ultrasounds had excellent sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 96% in the diagnosis of pneumonia [67] chest ultrasounds do not pose the burden of radiation exposure, can be performed right next to the patient, can be performed on pregnant women, and can more accurately diagnose hydrothorax. septation is indicative of birous strands between the parietal and visceral pleura, as well as inefficient drainage through the drainage tube. microbial tests have low sensitivity for community-acquired pneumonia. but they are still required for reasons related to appropriate antibiotic use and public health and epidemiological importance. for outpatients who are suspected of having antibiotic-resistant bacteria, perform blood culture. tests are selectively performed according to age, underlying diseases, severity markers, epidemiological factors, and current history of antibiotic use. sputum stain and tuberculosis test are performed when tuberculosis is suspected based on clinical or radiographic findings. invasive tests such as airway endoscopy and percutaneous pulmonary aspiration are useful. urinary antigen test is performed for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require hospitalization. results within 15 minutes, is simple to perform, can give positive results even when antibiotics are administered. the test is unaffected by the normal bacterial flora in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the Legionella urinary antigen test is an appropriate testing method for patients hospitalized for idiopathic pneumonia. it is recommended in cases of moderate pneumonia, in cases where epidemiological evidence of the disease is available, and in cases of no response to -lactam antibiotics. a blood culture test is performed before antibiotic administration for all patients with moderate or severe community-acquired pneumonia. it has low bacterial detection rates of 5-14% for community-acquired pneumonia. it provides important information about antibiotic resistance. it is advisable to perform blood culture, and sputum Gram smear and culture tests before antibiotic administration for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. key points Although microbial tests have low sensitivity for community-acquired pneumonia, they are still required for reasons related to appropriate antibiotic use. a blood culture, Legionella, S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test, and sputum gram smear and culture must be performed. for immunodeficient patients, invasive tests such as airway endoscopy and percutaneous pulmonary aspiration are useful. a retrospective study has reported that pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae was safely and effectively treated by high-dose penicillin administration. the Legionella urinary antigen test is an appropriate testing method for patients hospitalized for idiopathic pneumonia. the test has high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (>. a blood culture test is performed before antibiotic administration for all patients with moderate or severe community-acquired pneumonia. the bacterial detection rate of a blood culture for community-acquired pneumonia is low at 5-14%. the test gives positive results starting on the first day a disease occurs. a blood culture test is indicated and must be performed for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. the test is also recommended for patients with immunodeficiency disorders such as alienia and complement deficiencies, chronic liver disease, and leukopenia. patients with community-acquired pneumonia should be hospitalized or not according to objective criteria. hospitalization increases the risk of thrombosis and the risk of infection by more pathogenic or resistant bacteria. the rate of hospitalization of patients with community-acquired pneumonia largely varies. in one study, 845 of 1,889 patients (44.7%) with low-risk pneumonia admitted to an emergency department required hospitalization. at least 1/5 of these patients did not meet the criteria for hospitalization, and were hospitalized for unnecessary reasons. the PSI is a scoring system developed to identify low-risk patients. it was derived from data of 14,199 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. it was derived from data of 14,199 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. it was derived from data of 14,199 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. s +10 aAccompanying diseases: within one year, exclude cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. liver disease: clinically or histologically diagnosed liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis. congestive heart failure: medical history, examination, or tests; cerebrovascular diseases: stroke diagnosed based on clinical findings, CT or MRI. the CURB-65 and CRB-65 are reported to be on a par with one another in terms of their clinical usefulness. the higher the CURB-65 and CRB-65 scores, the higher the mortality. randomized studies have compared the predictive power of the two scoring systems using identical patient groups. the PSI classifies a larger number of patients as the low-risk group compared with the CURB-65 (PSI I-III, 68% vs. CURB-65 2, 61%), similar mortality rates are observed between the two groups. a patient may be placed in a low-risk group according to a severity scoring system. but the patient may still require hospitalization in the following situations. the patient\u2019s social situations and his/her physician must be considered together. a patient of advanced age who lives alone may require hospitalization. the community-acquired pneumonia guideline developed by the ATS/IDSA in 2007 proposes the new definition of severe pneumonia that requires ICU admission. the main standard includes dependence on mechanical ventilation, and septic shock that requires vasopressors. a patient is diagnosed with severe pneumonia if he/she satisfies one of the conditions from the main standard. ISDA/ATS criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia. main criteria Invasive mechanical ventilation Septic shock requiring vasopressors Minor criteria Breathing rate 30 breaths/min PaO2/FiO2 ratio 250 Multilobar invasion Confusion/disorientation Uremia (BUN 20 mg/dL). patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation or have septic shock must be hospitalized in ICU (level of recommendation: strong, level of evidence: moderate) the need for ICU admission must be reassessed (level of recommendation: weak, level of evidence: low) atory fluoroquinolones have excellent antibacterial activities against tuberculosis bacilli. they may thus delay diagnosis of tuberculosis in patients for whom tuberculosis has been misdiagnosed as another kind of bacterial pneumonia. the use of -lactam alone, the combined use of -lactam and macrolide, or the use of respiratory fluoroquinolones as empirical antibiotics is recommended. the IDSA/ATS guideline on pneumonia treatment developed in the united states in 2007 also gives the same recommendation. however, the use of a single antibiotic targeting the causative bacteria of atypical pneumonia had poorer clinical results than the use of -lactam alone. fluoroquinolone monotherapy shows excellent antibacterial activities against tuberculosis bacilli. for levofloxacin, it has been reported that once-daily administration of levofloxacin 750 mg for five days has excellent therapeutic effects. -lactam and macrolide antibiotics may be administered together in patients with mild to moderate pneumonia. the combined administration of -lactam and macrolide led to a higher rate of clinical stability compared with the administration of -lactams only in patients with pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria or with severe pneumonia. the 2007 IDSA/ATS guideline and the 2009 Korean guideline on community-acquired pneumonia recommend the administration of -lactams alone or in conjunction with macrolide, or the administration of respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. most of the studies on combined antibiotic administration included in these guidelines were either retrospective or observational studies. prospectively compares -lactam administration, and -lactam + macrolide administration in the treatment of patients with severe pneumonia. 41.2% and 33.6% of the patients in the -lactam group did not reach a clinically stable state after seven days. the rate of reaching clinical stability was lower in the -lactam group (7.9%, 3.1%, P = 0.01) oral antibiotics are not recommended as there have been reports of low oral bioavailability of erythromycin, increased QT interval, and increased cardiovascular risks associated with macrolides. fluoroquinolones are associated with delayed tuberculosis diagnosis and increased drug tolerance. antibiotics are generally administered for 7-10 days. the adequate duration of antibiotic administration may change depending on the causative bacteria, patient's conditions, type of antibiotics, treatment response, accompanying diseases. a patient must not have a fever for 48-72 hours. 133 of 200 patients (67%) hospitalized due to pneumonia satisfied these criteria within three days, and could switch to oral treatment [157] only one patient had a clinical treatment failure [157] in a retrospective study on 5,248 patients who had pneumonia, there was no difference in the 14-day readmission rate and the 30-day mortality rate between the patients discharged on the day they switched to oral antibiotics. if the same antibiotics are not available, it is recommended to use antibiotics of the same class. the more conditions the patient does not satisfy, the more likely he/she is likely to have poor prognoses. underlying diseases are the most common cause of readmission for patients who are discharged after undergoing treatment for pneumonia. low-molecular-weight heparin is injected into patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism. treatment must begin with 24-28% low concentration oxygen therapy, followed by oxygen infusion with oxygen saturation maintained at 88-92% and pH 7.35. -lactam + azithromycin/fluoroquinolone combination therapy is recommended over the respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy. key points For patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require ICU admission, combination therapy is recommended over monotherapy. combination therapy has been not more beneficial than monotherapy for treating mild pneumonia. however, combination therapy has produced better results for patients with severe pneumonia [142,173,174]. combination therapy (-lactam + macrolide or -lactam + fluoroquinolone) also led to higher survival rates compared with the -lactam monotherapy. some studies have also reported better treatment outcomes from combination therapy than from monotherapy even in patients treated with effective antibiotics. gram-negative bacillus infections including those caused by P. aeruginosa were associated with high mortality rates. clindamycin can reduce toxin production, and it is not yet clear if TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones can reduce toxin production. daptomycin is effective for soft tissue infection caused by MRSA or bacteremia. but its effectiveness may be reduced due to surfactants of the lungs. there is not enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of tigecycline in pneumonia. in studies involving patients with septic shock and adrenal insufficiency, steroid use lead to a decrease in the mortality rate. in a recently-conducted large-scale study, use of steroids in addition to pneumonia treatment led to faster bacteriological conversion, shortened the time until clinical stability, and shortened the duration of hospital stay. use of respiratory fluoroquinolones as empirical antibiotics must be avoided in situations where tuberculosis cannot be excluded. -lactam + macrolide is recommended for suspected atypical pneumonia. acin Macrolide or tetracycline monotherapy is not recommended. -lactam and macrolide may be used together if atypical pneumonia is suspected. there is a controversy about whether antibiotics should be used in the treatment of mild community-acquired pneumonia that does not require hospitalization. this recommendation is based on a research finding S. pneumoniae isolated in Korea have low penicillin resistance when the antibacterial susceptibility standard is used. the 2007 IDSA/ATS guideline, the 2009 BTS guideline, and the 2011 ERS/ESCMID guideline all recommended to use amoxicillin as the main antibiotic. the once-daily administration of levofloxacin 750 mg is pharmacodynamically more ideal than the same therapy using 500 mg levofloxacin. levofloxacin has settled as the standard method of treatment for pneumonia. -lactam and macrolide antibiotics may be administered together in patients with mild to moderate pneumonia. the combined administration of -lactam and macrolide led to a higher rate of clinical stability compared with the administration of -lactams only in patients with pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria. use of -lactams or respiratory fluoroquinolone alone is recommended for the empirical treatment of mild or moderate pneumonia. the 2007 IDSA/ATS guideline and the 2009 Korean guideline on community-acquired pneumonia recommend the administration of -lactams alone or in conjunction with macrolide. study by Grain et al. prospectively compares -lactam administration and -lactam + macrolide administration in the treatment of patients with severe pneumonia. 41.2% and 33.6% of the patients in the -lactam group did not reach a clinically stable state after seven days, respectively. there was no difference in the rate of reaching clinical stability between the patients without atypical bacterial infection. oral antibiotics are not recommended as there have been reports of low oral bioavailability of erythromycin, increased QT interval, and increased cardiovascular risks associated with macrolides. fluoroquinolones must be used with caution in Korea where the prevalence of tuberculosis is not low. mendation Antibiotics must be administered for at least five days. the adequate duration of antibiotic administration may change depending on the causative bacteria, patient\u2019s conditions, type of antibiotics, treatment response, accompanying diseases, and pneumonia complication status. 133 of 200 patients (67%) hospitalized due to pneumonia satisfied these criteria within three days, and could switch to oral treatment [157] only one patient had a clinical treatment failure [157] in a retrospective study on 5,248 patients of advanced age who had pneumonia, there was no difference in the 14-day readmission rate and the 30-day mortality rate between the patients discharged on the day they switched to oral antibiotics. if the same antibiotics are not available, it is recommended to use antibiotics of the same class. the more conditions the patient does not satisfy, the more likely he/she is likely to have poor prognoses. the more conditions the patient does not satisfy, the more likely he/she is likely to have poor prognoses. low-molecular-weight heparin is injected into patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism. treatment must begin with 24-28% low concentration oxygen therapy, followed by oxygen infusion with the oxygen saturation maintained at 88-92% and pH 7.35. the risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure is not high. the combined administration of -lactam and macrolide led to a higher rate of clinical stability compared with the administration of -lactams only in patients with pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria or with severe pneumonia. key points Antibiotics must be administered for at least five days (level of recommendation: strong, level of evidence: low) -lactam/macrolide (or respiratory fluoroquinolone) combination therapy leads to better prognoses than the respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy. if community-acquired pneumonia is suspected, a combination therapy using two antibiotics with antipseudomonal effects is performed to prevent inappropriate treatments. bacteria of community-acquired pneumonia and about 20% cases of community-acquired pneumonia are due to atypical bacteria. antibiotics that have antibacterial activities against these bacteria must be included in the early empirical treatment. combination therapy has produced better results for patients with severe pneumonia. the combination therapy (-lactam + macrolide or -lactam + fluoroquinolone) also led to higher survival rates compared with the -lactam monotherapy. this result was observed not in patients with mild pneumonia, but patients with severe pneumonia. antibiotics that are effective against and highly sensitive to S. pneumoniae must be selected. gram-negative bacillus infections including those caused by P. aeruginosa accounted for 10.1% of all cases of deaths, were the most common causative bacteria of severe pneumonia and were a risk factor of death. clindamycin and fluoroquinolones can reduce toxin production. rifampin, which has bactericidal activities against S. aureus may be used. there is not enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of tigecycline in pneumonia. mendation Steroid therapy may be considered for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia accompanied by shock (level of recommendation: weak, level of evidence: low) steroid use lead to a decrease in mortality rate in patients with hypoglycemia and side effects. the -lactam + azithromycin/fluoroquinolone combination therapy is recommended over the respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy. if pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa is suspected, a combination therapy using two antibiotics with antipseudomonal effects is performed to prevent inappropriate treatments. combination therapy showed better outcomes than fluoroquinolone monotherapy. most patients who are admitted to an ICU experience shock, or require mechanical ventilation. combination therapy is recommended over fluoroquinolone monotherapy for these patients. anti-pneumococcal, anti-pseudomonal -lactam + aminoglycoside + azithromycin (c) risk factors of P. aeruginosa infection include alcohol consumption, structural lung diseases such as bronchodilation. antibiotics that are effective against and highly sensitive to S. pneumoniae must be selected. community-acquired MRSA are rarely a cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia [182]. they occur in healthy adults who are not associated with the common risk factors of hospital-acquired infection. they produce Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL) toxins, cause necrotic pneumonia. infections caused by atypical bacteria account for over 20% of all cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia. in domestic studies, Legionella accounted for 0-5.3% of the causative bacteria of pneumonia. steroid therapy may be considered for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia accompanied by shock. in a relatively recently conducted randomized controlled study, the duration of hospital stay was reduced by 1-1.5 days in the steroid group. no significant differences in symptom improvements, overall cure rate, complications, rate of ICU admission, and mortality rate were observed compared with the other group that was not subjected to steroid administration. however, seven-day use of low-dose hydrocortisone reduced mortality rates in patients who had hypoadrenalism [196], and reduced mortality rates and the number of days patients with community-acquired pneumonia do not show clear symptom improvements. chest X-rays must be performed to differentiate between underlying lung diseases such as pneumonia 7-12 weeks after treatment. radiological anomalies manifest more slowly than clinical symptoms. patients with community-acquired pneumonia may not show radiological improvements until after 12 weeks. chest X-rays may be repeated to eliminate the possibility of underlying diseases such as pneumonia for patients who are 50 years or older. repeated CRP measurement at three or four days of treatment helped identify patients at risk of treatment failure or complications. repeated procalcitonin test may be used in the process of deciding whether to continue antibiotic treatment or not for patients who show clinical improvements. procalcitonin levels of 100 patients admitted to an ICU were measured at one and three days of hospitalization. increase in procalcitonin levels at three days was identified as a significant prognostic factor indicative of poor prognoses. randomized controlled clinical studies have been conducted to determine whether procalcitonin can be used as criteria for beginning or stopping antibiotic use. a prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled clinical study has recently published its findings regarding the use of the procalcitonin test as the criteria for cessation of antibiotic use. of the 1,575 patients included in this study, 792 (50.3%) had community-acquired pneumonia. lesion improvements manifest themselves more slowly than clinical symptoms on chest-X-rays of patients with pneumonia. for patients who are 50 years or older, are male, and are smokers, chest X-rays must be performed to differentiate between underlying lung diseases such as pneumonia 7-12 weeks after treatment. polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine has recently shown to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases in patients of advanced age. a protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has recently shown to prevent pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases. a combined injection of protein conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is recommended. the protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine prevented 45% of pneumococcal pneumonia, and 75% of invasive pneumococcal diseases. however, the vaccine had no preventive effects against other types of pneumonia. a domestic pneumococcal vaccination guideline recommends performing a combined injection of the protein conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines. a protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has recently shown to prevent pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases. for patients of advanced age, a combined injection of protein conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines is recommended."}
