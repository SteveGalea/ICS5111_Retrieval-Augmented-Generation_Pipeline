{"summary": "viral nucleic acid is cosseted by cellular membranes and a protective cytosolic environment. particles must be resilient enough to protect the genome from environmental insults but also appropriately labile to ensure the contents are released. viruses are constructed as metastable molecular assemblages that can be unlocked during entry. cytosis followed by pH-dependent/independent fusion from endocytic compartments (A) or pH-independent fusion at the plasma membrane. receptor-mediated signaling and coordinated disassembly of the actin cortex (B) nonenveloped viruses use similar strategies. many viruses use single molecular species as receptors, for example CD155 for poliovirus (Mendelsohn et al., 1989), the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for human rhinovirus 2 (Fig. 2 A; Hofer et al., 1994), and dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) for the phleboviruses (subgroup of interactions initiate conformational changes that facilitate strain-specific interactions of gp120 with coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4. engagement of the coreceptor drives further Env structural rearrangements that culminate in fusion of the viral and host membranes.

Epstein\u2013Barr virus Herpesviridae CD21 and MHC-II Fingeroth et al., 1984; Martino et al., 1997 Coxsackievirus human rhinovirus 2 undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis. virus penetration requires further interactions with chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. fusion can also occur after endocytosis. there is limited evidence for a direct interaction between the HCV glycoproteins and claudin-1 or occludin. there is limited evidence for a direct interaction between the HCV glycoproteins and claudin-1 or occludin. there is limited evidence for a direct interaction between the HCV glycoproteins and occludin. adenoviruses, rotaviruses, picornaviruses, and herpesviruses require multiple receptor moieties. viruses have the potential to cluster homogenous or heterogenous receptors. fusion/penetration dynamics, sites of entry, and subsequent uncoating remain poorly understood. the entry of coxsackievirus B requires the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), located on the basolateral surface and within tight junctions. the virions initially bind to an apically expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein, CD55/decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which activates Abl kinase. hepatitis A virus\u2013specific IgA facilitates transcytosis of virus particles through polarized epithelial cells via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. hepatitis A virus\u2013specific IgA facilitates transcytosis of virus particles through polarized epithelial cells via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. adenovirus type 2 uses CAR and 3/5 integrins for productive entry. intact epithelial monolayers are resistant to adenovirus type 2 infection from the apical side. analyzing virus entry in experimental systems can provide new insights to infection mechanisms. the cortex supports and modulates the physical and dynamic properties of the plasma membrane. the cortex has the potential to prevent or delay the transit of large molecular assemblies from the cytoplasm toward the plasma membrane. the cortex has the potential to prevent or delay the transit of large molecular assemblies from the cytoplasm toward the plasma membrane. endocytosis provides a mechanism through which viruses can pass through the cortex by exploiting intrinsic properties of endocytic vesicles to migrate. the requirement for exposure to low pH, lysosomal enzymes, or even the reducing environment of the ER ensures that they are captured by endocytic vesicles before undergoing the fusion/penetration reactions. internalized virus particles can fuse directly at the plasma membrane at neutral pH. this occurs at either mild pH (6.5\u20136) from the early endosome (B) or low pH (5.5\u20134) from late endosome and/or lysosome (C) an independent study has demonstrated that activation of PI3K, but not Akt, is required for influenza A virus entry. it is proposed that influenza A virus\u2013mediated clustering of sialylated receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR or c-Met, activates tyrosine kinase and PI3K signaling. it remains unclear whether this signal propagation is linked to virus internalization by a clathrin-dependent or membrane tubulation is dependent on the long acyl chains of GM1 but is independent of cellular energy. subsequent scission requires tyrosine kinase activity and actin rearrangements. it has been suggested that caveolae coat proteins and dynamin are also recruited. in vitro mimivirus can infect professional phagocytes via PI3K and dynamin-II-dependent phagocytosis. macropinocytosis involves actin remodeling mediated by Rac-1 GTPase and its effector p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak-1), leading to the extension of membrane ruffles and blebs from the cell surface. poxviruses have the unusual characteristic of producing two forms of infectious particle. a second form, the so-called extracellular virus, is a mature virion that undergoes further envelopment by wrapping in membrane cisternae derived from the TGN or endosomes. the filamentous particles of Ebola virus have a diameter of only 80\u2013100 nm. it is not surprising that these viruses also induce macropinocytosis through Rac-1/Pak-1\u2013dependent membrane ruffling. fusion or penetration from endosomes offers several potential advantages to a virus. it ensures there is no cortical actin barrier to contend with, limits the display of viral components on the surface of the cell where they may be targets. the endosomal lumen is a dynamic labyrinth of vesicles and tubules. maturation to late endosomes and lysosomes renders the endosomal lumen a potentially hazardous environment. many viruses fuse/penetrate at mildly acid pH (approximately pH 6.0) in early endosomes. fusion of tick-borne encephalitis virus requires cholesterol in the target membrane. fusion of Semliki Forest virus is dependent on both cholesterol and sphingolipids. other viruses, including SARS coronavirus and orthoreoviruses, exhibit pH-dependent entry. new findings suggest a putative entry pathway for the infamous virus. they suggest that NPC1 acts as a postendocytic intracellular receptor necessary for virus penetration. this suggests a putative entry pathway for the infamous virus. the journey into the cell interior is complete after fusion/penetration from endosomes. some DNA (e.g., adenoviruses and herpesviruses) and RNA (e.g., influenza viruses) viruses use the inherent capacity of endosomes to move along microtubules before fusion/penetration. the baculovirus Autographa californica P78/83 capsid protein acts as a nucleation site for Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization that drives the virion through the cell interior. as capsids reach the nucleus, they are held against the nuclear membrane by continuing actin polymerization, promoting their ultimate invasion through nuclear pores. receptors are cell surface molecules that provide functions essential for productive infection. receptors can effectively target viruses for endocytosis. alternatively, receptors may be used to activate specific signaling pathways that facilitate entry, or they may directly drive fusion/penetration events at the surface of a target cell. human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) are the archetype for such a process. engagement of the coreceptor drives further Env structural rearrangements.

HCV requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis and low endosomal pH for productive infection. receptor engagement plays a more substantial role in virus entry than just guiding virions into clathrin-coated vesicles. viruses have the potential to cluster homogenous or heterogenous receptors. but we know relatively little of the stoichiometry of receptor engagement. fusion/penetration dynamics, sites of entry, and subsequent uncoating remain poorly understood. coxsackievirus B requires the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), located on the basolateral surface and within tight junctions. the virions initially bind to an apically expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein, CD55/decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which activates Abl kinase and drives Rac-dependent actin reorganization. hepatitis A virus\u2013specific IgA facilitates transcytosis of virus particles through polarized epithelial cells via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. complexed IgA acts as a bridging component for sequential receptor-mediated hepatitis A virus transit and infection. receptors expressed on respiratory epithelial cells (CXCR1/2) induce redistribution of both 3 and CAR to the apical surface, where they mediate virus entry. analyzing virus entry in experimental systems that mimic normal tissues can provide new insights to infection mechanisms. env engagement with the coreceptor CXCR4 on resting CD4+ve T cells leads to Gi signaling and subsequent activation of the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin to induce local cortex reorganization that facilitates infection. cross-linking EGFR and v3 integrin by human cytomegalovirus at the cell surface results in the cooperative activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src human rhinovirus 2 is internalized via the constitutive clathrin-mediated endocytosis of its receptor LDLR. endocytic sorting signals in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DC-SIGN are essential for endocytosis and infection. influenza A virus internalized by both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin/caveolin-independent mechanisms. clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis trigger virus uptake into endosomes. it is proposed that influenza A virus\u2013mediated clustering of sialylated receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR or c-Met, activates SV40 particles bind directly to the cell surface via the sialic acid moieties of GM1 gangliosides. membrane deformation by SV40 has parallel with endocytosis of shiga and cholera. similar pentameric ganglioside binding sites on SV40 and the two toxins appear to induce asymmetric compressive stress that promotes local membrane tubulation. some related polyomaviruses also induce tubulation and may share a common route of internalization. e and its effector p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak-1), leading to the extension of membrane ruffles and blebs from the cell surface. e and its effector p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak-1), leading to the extension of membrane ruffles and blebs from the cell surface. the cellular receptors for Vaccinia virus are unknown. attachment of mature virions activates EGFR, Rho-GTPases, and actin remodeling. phosphatidylserine associated with the mature virion membrane has been proposed to contribute to atypical macropinocytosis. a study has demonstrated entry by direct fusion at the cell surface as well as by fusion after endocytosis for herpesviruses. however, work with inhibitors of endocytosis and direct single-particle tracking have recently provided evidence that fusion and infection occur after endocytic uptake. the ability to use different mechanisms may have distinct advantages for viruses. most viruses internalized by endocytosis are delivered to endosomes. many use endosomal environmental cues, usually low pH, to trigger the membrane fusion/penetration reactions that deliver the viral genetic material to the cytoplasm. fusion from endosomes offers several potential advantages to a virus. neurons are an extreme example in which viruses may be taken into the cell by endocytosis at a peripheral synapse. in such cases, viruses can exploit endosomal transport along axons and use the lower pH of late endosomes. fusion of tick-borne encephalitis virus requires cholesterol in the target membrane. proteolytic cleavage of viral envelope or surface proteins triggers structural changes required for fusion. depletion of NPC1 from target cells prevents Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent fusion, suggesting that NPC1 acts as a postendocytic intracellular receptor necessary for virus penetration. viral glycoprotein GP1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage by cathepsins L and B. fusion is dependent on the viral glycoprotein GP2 and occurs from the late endosome/lysosome. the exact molecular triggers remain unclear. the use of so-called actin comets to propel virus particles during viral egress is well documented for Vaccinia virus. baculovirus Autographa californica P78/83 capsid protein acts as a nucleation site for actin polymerization that drives the virion through the cell interior. receptors are organized, how they are commandeered by viruses to form functional entry complexes, and how they engage the machinery of the cell to mediate infection."}
