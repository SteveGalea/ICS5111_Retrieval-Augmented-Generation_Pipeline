{"summary": "zoonotic avian influenza has remained endemic in china and globally for nearly two decades. in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in china. this study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles. avian influenza virus (AIV) of subtype H5N1 emerged in humans in 1997. the virus has since spread across Asia, Africa and Europe. in 2013 a new subtype H7N9 emerged in humans in china and the human case count by December 2016 was over 795. SDMs are models which quantify the relationship between species distribution data and a set of environmental covariates. they can help to identify risk factors of disease occurrence and reveal specific areas at highest risk of transmission which can be targeted for surveillance and control efforts. 5N1 or H7N9 human infection defined as the risk in one cell compared to other cells in our study area. only four studies have used a formal risk assessment method to build spatial risk maps. the study only used imprecise coordinate data to validate their model. most previous H7N9 SDMs used aggregated data and low resolution spatial units, e.g. county-level analyses [26,27,30] while few analysed data at high (e.g. approximately 1km2) resolutions [25,29], only Martin et al. [37] took accuracy of coordinate data into account. most H7N9 studies additionally used only locations of positive virus detections in bird or bird-environments to define whether a location was infected. study area is approximately 9,596,960 km2 and is extremely diverse in terms of physical and human geography. eastern and southern half of china consists of fertile, low-lying land and is more amenable to agricultural activity and human habitation. western and northern half of china largely consists of uninhabitable desserts, mountains and high plateaus. case records with low or unknown location quality and low precision were assigned to an \u201cunexact\u201d data set. EMPRES-i records included information on the locality, and an evaluation of the quality of location coordinates. only records where the precision of coordinates were specifically assigned \u201cexact\u201d were included in our \u201cexact\u201d data set. Elevation data was downloaded from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 90m Digital Elevation Database v4.1 (www.cgiar-csi.org, last accessed 12 October 2015). the data was used to derive the slope, aspect and composite topographic index using the Spatial Analyst extension of ArcMap 10.2. data was originally available in a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. it was resampled to align to the extent of worldClim layers. values at each cell represent the average or ambient human population distribution. the probability distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. the most spread out distribution) subject to a set of environmental constraints that represent the species distribution. Maxent consistently produces relatively accurate results, even when only small sample sizes are available (generally considered as n 100) temperatures and precipitation can influence survivability of AIVs in the environment. temperatures and precipitation can influence survivability of AIVs in the environment. temperatures and precipitation can influence survivability of AIVs. a variety of landcover and satellite data sets exist, and have been used in previous SDM models [20,22,23,25,60]. the reasoning behind their use is similar to the reasoning behind use of climate variables (they are able to capture seasonality and thus waterfowl migration patterns) models 5\u20138 were created using only a subset of the original geographic study area. we selected only primary administrative regions (provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions) which had at least one H5N1 or H7N9 case. in total, 22 of 31 primary administrative regions were selected as the subset study area. the Maxent software has a relaxation component (regularization) designed to counteract correlations. overfitting is more likely to occur when large numbers of environmental layers are used due to correlations between variables. a sign of overfitting is when a model performs very well (i.e. has high AUC results on the training data set), however performs poorly for unseen data. for zoonotic transmission to take place, a susceptible human must be within range of an infected animal (or an animal environment contaminated by high viral shedding) the level of opportunity for human exposure from the virus is proportional to the product of the number of infected animals and the number of susceptible humans [65] to estimate the risk of circulating viruses to cause human infection, the SDM outputs for H5N1 and H7N9 are combined with human population density. both human and chicken population densities were normalized to the highest value over all cells, k, in the study area. a log transformation was used for the human population density and intensive and extensive chicken population density variables, due to their highly skewed nature. a review of the literature found that large commercial chicken farms often implement appropriate biosecurity regulations and are expected to have little risk of H5N1 occurrence. subsistence farmers with very small flock densities are considered to have negligible risk due to insufficient hosts to sustain an outbreak. study area The whole of Mainland China was selected as the study area. the study area is approximately 9,596,960 km2 and is extremely diverse in terms of physical and human geography. the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture avian influenza surveillance reports (www.syj.moa.gov.cn, last accessed 21 September 2015) and official H7N9 world organization of animal health (oie.int) were also used to extract the names of locations reported to have a positive sample of H5N1 or H7N9. we obtained coordinates for 267 H5N1 records, and 1289 H7N9 records. we summarised our H5N1 and H7N9 exact data sets by year of outbreak or human case onset. each layer was available at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. data was originally available in a resolution of 30 arc-seconds and was resampled to align to the extent of WorldClim layers. values at each cell represent the average or ambient human population distribution. Maxent software [43] is primarily used in ecological sciences to model species distributions. the algorithm has previously been used in regional and global studies of avian influenza [17,18,20,22,23,25]. the environmental data was included because climate factors are known to influence AIV occurrence. examples include modulating survival of AIV in the environment, and modifying animal host behaviour, or human behaviour. the reasons for their inclusion were (i) they are widely available for most countries, and (ii) in some studies, they have been found to contribute significantly to AIV occurrence, possibly as a surrogate indicator for some unknown variable related to AIV risk [56]. we were unable to obtain reliable H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence or detection rates for all of mainland China at high resolution. for each study, 100 models were created and relevant outputs were averaged. for models 5\u20138, which included a subset of the environmental variables, 11 of the 23 environmental variables were finally chosen to be included in the subset. in total, 22 of 31 primary administrative regions were selected as the subset study area. we evaluated each of the 8 models based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) values. the ROC plot is a plot of sensitivity and 1\u2013specificity. models 5\u20138 were developed using a subset of the original study area of mainland china. compared to models 1\u20134 in terms of differences in distributions, AUC and overfitting. risk model construction SDMs alone can only provide estimates of the probability of virus presence. risk models were constructed for each virus subtype independently. a value between 0 and 1 was computed for each cell representing the relative risk of a human infection of H5N1 or H7N9 compared to other cells. these models combine ecological factors with demographic and agricultural factors known to modulate AIV transmission. the majority of cases for both H5N1 and H7N9 fell in regions with medium human density and medium poultry densities. less cases fell in low and high density regions. for chicken density this is possibly because H5N1 is more likely to occur in chicken farms with poor hygiene and farming practices. the human and chicken density variables were reclassified to a scale of 0 to 1 based on a simple Gaussian fuzzy membership function prior to being used in the risk function. x values move away from the midpoint, their membership to the set gradually decreases. SDM models 1\u20132 suffered from overfitting based on Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests. overfitting was not an issue for SDMs 5\u20136. the term suitability distribution refers to the distribution of these suitability values in geographic space.

LBM data was only available for 43 (of 344) prefectures, municipalities and cities within 10 (of 31) provinces in china. only 10 (of 52) H5N1 exact points and 45 (of 69) H7N9 exact points fell into these regions. iii developed a risk analysis framework, which integrated Maxent models with human and chicken population density to estimate geographic risk of zoonotic transmission of H5N1 and H7N9. areas of china at high risk of both H5N1 and H7N9 transmission differentiated into two groups, those that have not yet reported cases. both H5N1 and H7N9 risk models showed reasonable predictive capacity. the majority of exact points fell into high and medium-high risk areas. the predictive capacity for the H5N1 risk model was lower for the model. our exact H7N9 cases were mostly concentrated in Guangdong (20 of 29) and Zhejiang (11 of 69) whereas H5N1 cases are more evenly spread across the 17 primary administrative areas. we would expect to find more H5N1 cases in the years before widescale vaccination campaigns in poultry from 2004 to 2008. the authors aggregated their model into two spatial regions which encapsulated multiple provinces. the southern region included Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces. the eastern region included Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui provinces. a bias for AIV reporting may occur because areas of high human density often have more resources to implement active and passive surveillance of AIV. this may also partially explain why our models may have overestimated the risk posed to areas with high human density. ling and manipulation of original data precludes our ability to make inferences regarding the original data. abundance of H5N1 and H7N9 in avian populations is considered to be extremely low as determined in previous meta-analysis of H5N1 and H7N9 surveillance studies. the level of animal handling, personal protection or biosecurity measures are currently not collected on a large scale. this study did not take into account the wide range of competing AIV subtypes, nor did it differentiate between strains within a subtype. study finds differences in geographic distribution and performance of H5N1 and H7N9 SDMs suggesting there may be intrinsic differences in how the novel H7N9 survives in the environment. base maps were obtained from the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas (http://www.gadm.org/). maps were built using ArcMap 10.2 (TIF) Click here for additional data file. the first panel shows H5N1 (SDM 1) and the second panel shows H7N9 (SDM 2).
