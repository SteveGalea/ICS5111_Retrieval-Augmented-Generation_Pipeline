{"summary": "a 6-year-old boy (patient 1) and his 22-month-old cousin (patient 2) were hospitalized with the same ANE-specific symptoms a few days apart. an influenza-like syndrome developed simultaneously in the mother of patient 2. early viral stocks were made from urine and throat specimens added to MRC5 cells as soon as cytopathic effects were observed. late viral stocks were obtained after inoculation of MRC5 cells. the PCR products were purified from the gel and cloned. a specific primer was constructed and used for the RT step. the band corresponding to the expected size (684 bp) was purified from the gel, cloned, and sequenced. 2 forward TAATCTGCTGACCGTCACTC 3\u201322 (SC-A) 2,195 GU196310 M2 reverse GTGCATCATCATCATTAACC 2197\u20132179 (SC-A) M3 forward CGTGGTCATGGCTTCATTC 12\u201330 (SC-A) 2,230 GU196311 M3 reverse GATGAATAGGGGTCGGGAA 2241\u20132223 (SC-A) S2 forward CTATTCGCTGGTCTATG 2\u201321 phylogenetic analysis Sequence alignments (nucleic acid and amino acid) were constructed using ClustalW 1.74 (16) and refined by visual inspection with SEAVIEW. distance matrix and phylogenetic trees were computed by observed divergence. tree topologies were tested with 1,000 bootstrap sampling replicates. serum, urine, CSF, and throat swab specimens were collected from both children. an influenza-like syndrome developed simultaneously in the mother of patient 2. cell pellets were embedded in Epon resin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France), allowed to polymerize for 48 h at 60\u00b0C. ultrathin sections were cut, stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 5% lead citrate. to obtain the S1 segment, we extracted total RNA from infected BGM cells with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) the RT step was done by using the specific S1 primer and a random primer. the band corresponding to the expected size (684 bp) was purified from the gel, cloned, and sequenced. the new sequences enabled construction of specific primers at each extremity to amplify the entire S1 segment and sequence in both directions.

MRI of the brain found that the damage was less visible and the signal was much less marked. all serum specimens collected during acute and convalescent phases were negative for antibodies against influenza viruses. a discrepant result for enterovirus was obtained when identification was attempted. indirect immunofluorescence on fixed cells was positive for enterovirus.
