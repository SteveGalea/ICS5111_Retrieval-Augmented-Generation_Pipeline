{"summary": "TEXT A large number of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates owe this property to the presence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. the aminoglycoside 6\u2032-N-acetyltransferase type Ib is responsible for resistance to amikacin (AMK) and other aminoglycosides in Acinetobacter as well as bacteria from the families of Enterobacteriaceae. A. baumannii A118(pJHCMW1) and A118(pMET1) (16) are clinical isolates that naturally carry aac(6\u2032)-Ib (15. plasmids pJHCMW1 or pMET1 carry aac(6\u2032)-Ib (17, 18) cultures were carried out for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in 100-l volumes with shaking. optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured every 20 min. resistant A. baumannii, we first determined the MICs of AMK in the presence or absence of 0.8 mM ZnCl2. we extended these analyses to include the strains A155, A110, and A144, which naturally include this gene. in all cases, we observed a similar reduction in MIC of AMK (Table 1). MICs of AMK in the presence of 4 and 10 M ZnPT were 3 and 0.5 g/ml respectively, suggesting more efficient uptake of zinc. growth curves of A. baumannii A155 cultured in the presence of 8 g/ml AMK and 2 g/ml ZnPT showed significant inhibition of growth when the antibiotic and ZnPT were present. panels A, C, E, and G show the effect of addition of ZnCl2 (A and E) or ZnPT (C and G) on resistance to 8 g/ml AMK. unlike the case of A. baumannii, ZnCl2 at concentrations up to 1 mM were unable to inhibit resistance to AMK. Zn2+, a well-known inhibitor of numerous enzymes, also inhibits the AAC(6\u2032)-Ib-mediated acetylation of aminoglycosides. in presence of ZnCl2, the MIC of AMK of A. baumannii harboring aac(6\u2032)-Ib was reduced but only when ZnCl2 concentrations were as high as 0.5 mM. this could be due to reduced permeability or active strong tendency to keep Zn+2 homeostasis may result in inhibition of uptake or efflux of the ions, reducing the intracellular concentration and avoiding inactivation of the enzyme. a way to overcome this limitation could be to induce an increase in the intracellular Zn2+ concentration using a zinc-ionophore complex. the cell could induce expression of known or unknown detoxification systems that elevate the efflux of the ions. 58_7_4238__index.html (1.2KB, html)."}
