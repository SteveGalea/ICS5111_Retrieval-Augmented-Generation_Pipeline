{"summary": "the CC50 value of each flavonoid was calculated (Table 1). There was no observed cytotoxicity for cells treated with 0.1% DMSO. silymarin inhibits early post-entry stages of CHIKV replication. highest concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol only exhibited 25% CPE inhibitory activity. silymarin inhibits early post entry stages of CHIKV replication cycle. the vero cells were treated with 100 g/ml of silymarin at stated time-points. copy number of viral RNA in supernatants at was measured at 48 h pi. the inhibition was highly significant (P = 0.016) confirming that silymarin affects post-entry steps of CHIKV infection. this data also indicates that silymarin can interfere with CHIKV RNA replication by affecting the viral replicase system. silymarin treated with increasing concentrations of silymarin (P = 0.0199) silymarin had IC50 = 16.9 g/ml with SI of 25.1. silymarin acts at the post-entry stage of CHIKV infection. kaempferol and quercetin showed no significant inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication. silymarin suppresses accumulation of CHIKV-encoded proteins. western blot analysis was performed to determine the effect of silymarin on production of nsP1, nsP3 and E2 proteins. silybin interferes with early post-entry of CHIKV infection in dose-dependent manner. the CC50 value of each compound was calculated (Table 1). There was no observed cytotoxicity for cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (final concentration of solvent, used to dissolve flavonoids, in cell culture media) s of quercetin and kaempferol only exhibited 25% CPE inhibitory activity (Fig. 1a) the results of CPE inhibition assay were further confirmed by using MTS assay. silymarin inhibits early post-entry stages of CHIKV replication. the vero cells were treated with 100 g/ml of indicated flavonoids. g/ml of silymarin at stated time-points and infected with CHIKV at an MOI = 1 (\u201c0\u201d time point). copy number of viral RNA in supernatants at was measured at 48 h pi. IC50 of silybin, one of the major components of silymarin, was estimated as 59.8 M (approximately 30 g/ml) silymarin exhibits a statistically significant (P 0.05) dose-dependent inhibition on the Rluc activity produced by BHK-CHIKV-NCT replicon. marin 2 hpi showed significant inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication. kaempferol and quercetin showed no significant inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication. silymarin reduces CHIKV RNA copy number in growth medium in dose dependent manner. a dose dependent reduction of CHIKV nsP1, nsP3 and E2 proteins was observed upon silymarin treatments for 48 h. -actin is used as a loading control for each set of samples. silybin interferes with early post-entry of CHIKV infection in dose-dependent manner. effective concentration of silymarin was much lower than MNTD. kaempferol and quercetin showed significant antiviral activity against in vitro replication of CHIKV in both assays. nsP3 was used to quantify copy number of viral RNA released. silymarin effect on post-entry stages of CHIKV dose response analysis was also performed using a CHIKV replicon cell line where no virus entry or exit takes place. this finding confirms that silymarin suppresses CHIKV RNA replication and does it in dose-dependent manner. silymarin inhibits the expression of NS5B of hepatitis C virus. hepatoprotective property of silymarin in the context of blocking HCV infection is another important criteria for this compound to be considered as a therapeutic candidate for hepatitis C19,27,28. the CHIKV isolate used in this experiment was a clinical isolate from an outbreak in Johor in 2008 coded as MY/065/08/FN295485. it belongs to the ECSA genotype and has the A226V mutation in E1 protein29,30. both cell lines were cultured using Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin. flavonoids Silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. stock solutions of flavonoids, 50 g/ml, were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored in 20 \u00b0C for future use. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. the half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for each compound was determined by this assay using Graph Pad Prism 5. the EMEM supplemented with 2% inactivated FBS was added into every wells. the plate was incubated for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. the activity the Renilla Luciferase (Rluc) expressed by CHIKV replicon was detected. as for 2 hour, vero cells were treated with 100 g/ml of silymarin. the plate was then incubated for one hour at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. one hour later, 1 hour wells were also treated with 100 g/ml of silymarin. the unincorporated primers were digested with 20U of Exonuclease I. the qRT-PCR was performed with a Step-OnePlus Real-Time PCR System. on X100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail. cellular debris pelleted out by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 5 min. blots were rinsed three times with 1X PBS Tween20. blots containing same samples were incubated with anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody dissolved in 1% Casein for 1 hour at room temperature on shaker. blots were then washed three times with 1X PBS Tween 20 for 15 minutes each time. chikungunya virus, human enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A1631,32 were widely used in in vitro antiviral research. the CHIKV replicon cells20 were grown and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% tryptose-broth phosphate and penicillin-streptomycin. flavonoids Silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis the plate was then
