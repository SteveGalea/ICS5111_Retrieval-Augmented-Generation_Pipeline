{"summary": "NNPD affects piglets during the first week of life and results in impaired welfare, decreased weight gain, and in the worst-case scenario death. common preventative interventions such as vaccination or treatment with antibiotics have a limited effect on NNPD. previous studies have investigated clinical manifestations, histopathology, and to some extent, microbiological findings. genus Enterococcus and species E. coli contributed to the risk of having NNPD. results indicate that NNPD is associated with a disturbed bacterial composition. electronic supplementary material available to authorized users."}
