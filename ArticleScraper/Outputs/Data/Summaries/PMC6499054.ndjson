{"summary": "pigs experience watery diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration. PEDV-infected pigs experience watery diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration. transmission is frequently fecal-oral, but infections via airborne and fomites have been documented. PEDV was associated with high morbidity and mortality among infected pigs. the strains contain insertions and deletions in the N-terminal region of the S protein (S1 region) compared to the prototype CV777. one-third of the S gene among the new variants shared greater than 95% identity to the classical G1a strain. 769 samples were submitted to the Livestock Animal Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University in Nakhon Pathom province between May 2011 and august 2016. most of the samples were primarily submitted from the central part of Thailand where the majority of swine farms are located. RT was performed at 48 \u00b0C for 45 min. PCR cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. samples tested positive for the S gene were subjected to amplification. e strains in which sequences were available for inclusion in all three phylogenetic trees were CV777 (Belgian strain), attenuated DR13 (Korean strain), and 96P4-C6 (Japanese strain) deduced amino acid sequences of the Thai strains were also compared to those of the vaccine strains. RT was performed at 48 \u00b0C for 45 min. PCR cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. annealing temperatures were 51 \u00b0C and 55 \u00b0C. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method. bootstrap values 80% were considered significant. 153 out of 769 samples tested positive for the PEDV S gene. three Thai PEDV strains (NP-68/12, NP-65/14, and RB38/15) were genetically distinct from others. Previously identified PEDV in Thailand from past years (red) and 95 strains identified in this study (black) were compared to the vaccine strains (blue) using the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA6. all 92 Thai strains from the G1-3 group shared G594S. most possessed A517S, L521H, T549S, L612F, and I667F. analysis of the ORF3 gene was phylogenetically divided into two groups. all Thai strains belonging to G3-1 (83/95) are genetically close to reference strains previously identified in the U.S. (OH851) and China (CH/ZMDZY/11) analysis of the S gene Based on genetic analysis, the S sequences clustered into two major groups. three Thai PEDV strains (NP-68/12, NP-65/14, and RB38/15) were genetically distinct from others. all 95 Thai strains differed from CV777 at residues S523G, V527I, and I635V. all 92 Thai strains from the G1-3 group shared G594S. majority of the Thai strains (83/95) were more closely related to the previous Thai strains than to the vaccine strains. all Thai strains were similar to CV777 in absence of deletions of residues 82\u201399 and 138\u2013139 in the ORF3 protein compared to other vaccine strains. Previously identified PEDV in Thailand from past years (red) and 95 strains identified in this study were compared to the vaccine strains (blue) three Thai strains (TH/RB160/16, TH/RB161/16, and TH/RB-838/14) were missing residues K243 and Q244. residue E251 was absent in TH/NP-68/12. variations on the epitope region seen in circulating PEDV strains may affect viral neutralization and vaccine escapes. however, prediction of viral antigenicity should not rely solely on the variations on the COE antigenic epitopes. previous reports of molecular surveillance of PEDV on Thai swine farms have mainly examined the genetic diversity of the S, M, and ORF3 genes. the N protein is abundantly expressed during the early stages of PEDV infection and is therefore a preferred target for PEDV detection. the vaccine strains were genetically distant compared to the current field strains in circulation. several Thai strains from different age, herd, and year of collection had identical amino acid sequences. this observation is consistent with the potential transmission of PEDV from farm to farm due to animal transportation and trade. recurrent PEDV outbreaks on Thai farms were also likely due to circulation and re-emergence. induction of immunity among lactating sows from ingestion of fecal slurry or homogenized intestines of infected neonatal piglets presents the risk of unintended transmission of other enteric pathogens. we did not include in our analysis the PEDV strains with missing S, ORF3 or N gene sequences. Strain NP-68/12 differed most from CV777 which showed in gray highlight. numbers indicate residue position. Identical residues are dotted. erj.6843/supp-6 Supplemental Information 7. Amino acid sequence alignment of the partial N gene from Thai PEDV strains with deletions. numbers indicate residue position. Identical residues are noted with dashed lines covered by the red boxes. Residue differences within the S, ORF3, and N of the Thai PEDV, CV777, and other vaccine strains. Vaccine strains include Attenuated DR13, 94P4-C6, and P-5V. the percentage detection and provincial origins of 95 PEDV strains are determined and represent in pie chart.
