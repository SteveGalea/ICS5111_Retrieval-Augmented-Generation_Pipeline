{"summary": "a myotis velifer incautus cell line was originally derived from an interscapular tumor (MVI-it) the growth properties of this cell line changed over several weeks in culture, from doubling approximately once a week to rapidly proliferating, doubling every 2 to 3 days. mRNA was purified and subjected to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by an initial assembly that generated approximately 5,000 contigs. de novo assembly finds transcripts from a novel gammaherpesvirus Protein type and assembly gene identifiera Contig lengthb Homologous gammaherpesvirus (protein product)c Structural proteins BatA76 441 EHV-2 (glycoprotein B) BatA222 354 Myotis ricketti herpesvirus 2 (glycoprotein B) BatA401 420 EHV-2 (glycoprotein H) BatA a total of 5,818 contigs were generated from de novo-assembled RNA-seq data. contig length represents the number of amino acids present following translation of each sequence. multiple primate cell lines are permissive for BGHV8 transcription and replication. signal was measured with primer pairs specific for a BGHV8 capsid gene. we detected BGHV8 genome amplification and mRNA expression in vero and Huh7 cells. supernatant transfer from the MVI-it bat cell line to vero cells results in syncytia and CPE. representative 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) data from BGHV8 on vero cells. to prove that infectivity of the virus can be propagated beyond a single passage in cell culture, we passaged the virus multiple times in Vero cells. we optimized assays to measure infectivity, including a plaque assay (Fig. 2C) and a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay (Fig. 2D) on vero cells, the most permissive cell electron microscopy of the MVI-it cell line identifies viral particles that appear to be BGHV8. the black and red boxes highlight enlarged regions directly below the image above. both areas identify budding and fully budded herpesvirus virions. to annotate the assembled BGHV8, we developed gammaherpesvirus-specific annotation software in the Viral Genome ORF Reader (VIGOR) software (24) with relaxed parameters on the percent similarity cutoff. VIGOR was used to predict genes, perform alignments, ensure the fidelity of open reading frames. open reading frames are highlighted as follows. yellow, ORFs with homology to EHV-2; blue, ORFs with homology to other herpesvirus proteins; black, repeat regions; gray, putative LANA gene with an internal unresolved repeat region. ncRNA, noncoding RNA. Mapping of tandem repeats and putative miRNAs carried in the BGHV8 genome. all sequences were trimmed, and the alphaherpesvirus human herpesvirus 1 gB protein served as an outgroup. we then generated a phylogenetic tree for the protein and rooted it on the outgroup. this confirms that BGHV8 is similar to other gammaherpesviruses (28), including other apparent bat gammaherpesviruses. all sequences were trimmed to include only the corresponding region. an alignment was derived with an LG substitution model and 100 bootstraps with a scale of 0.4. the most closely related sequence from this analysis comes from a gB sequence of Myotis ricketti herpesvirus 2 (AFM85235.1). an alignment of the BGHV8 v-OX2 aligned with the KSHV v-OX2 highlights conserved regions in red. phylogenic analysis of the other ORFs confirmed the relatedness of additional BGHV8 ORFs with other gammaherpesvirus ORFs. x virus v-OX2 outgroup, black indicates gammaherpesvirus v-OX2 and pink denotes betaherpesvirus v-OX2. blue labels denote microbat sequences, green labels denote megabat sequences. the red label highlights the location of BGHV8. the full genome map is available at http://katahdin.mssm.edu/ravi/web/lwgv/lwgv/lwgv.cgi\"ann=nbghv_3.ann. RNA-seq analysis from the MVI-it culture indicates that a majority of the coding sequences are transcribed. reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) for each CDS of BGHV8 are displayed. a heat map imposed on the BGHV8 genome also illustrates the relative expression of each CDS. supernatant obtained from a confluent 75-centimeter flask of MVI-it cells was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 20 min. supernatant was transferred to uninfected vero cells seeded in 6-well plates. both TCID50 and plaque assays were used to calculate viral stock titers. both uninfected cells and cells at days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection were collected for total RNA. the pellets were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h, washed with distilled water, and en bloc stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. the pellets were dehydrated in ethanol, processed through propylene oxide, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) annotation was manually verified and edited as required, according to the gene and protein naming convention of the reference genome. we analyzed the assembled BGHV8 sequence in a tandem repeat finder program (http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html)"}
