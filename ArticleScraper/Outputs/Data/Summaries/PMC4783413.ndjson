{"summary": "PEDv is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus under the Coronaviridae family. it causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality particularly in piglets. it has been reported in other European countries and Asia over the past four decades. PEDv is able to survive up to 3 weeks at 4\u00b0C, 2 weeks at 12\u00b0C, 1 week at 22\u00b0C in spray dried plasma (Pujols and Segales, 2014), which was epidemiologically recognized as the source of virus infection. proper storage, treatment and utilization of infected manure are important to prevent further contamination of uninfected environments. five cases of PEDv outbreaks have been reported since february 2014. the exact length of PEDv survivability in infected EMS is still unknown. this is an important question to answer in order to allow farmers and manure applicators to take necessary precautions to avoid further disease spread. pigs looked healthy, active without any signs of scouring. initial tests were done at Veterinary Diagnostic Services of Manitoba. samples included saliva, fecal swabs (live animal and manure) and environmental swabs (load out, entrance) samples from farm-1 EMS were collected at 12 different locations and at three depths (n = 36/week) from farm-2 EMS, data loggers were placed at three different locations to continuously record the temperature and pH throughout the sampling period. primary containment tote was taken to the change tent and left in the change tent. a secondary containment tote was taken to the EMS. manure samples were subdivided into vials and placed in the cooler with dry ice. INDEL strains of PEDv using duplex real-time RT-PCR. a 500 bp of spike gene fragment that included sequence variation between PEDv strain OH1414 (virulent PEDv) and PEDv strain OH851 (variant PEDv) was chosen to use as both standard and positive control. the detection limit was two copies for both variant and virulent strains of PEDv. the standard curves of virulent and variant PEDv were plotted with slopes of -3.358 and -3.363, respectively. triplicate for each EMS sample was also subjected for duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. VERO cells (ATCC CCL-81) in 96-well plate were washed twice with 100 l PBS then inoculated with 200 l of sample. after 1.5 h incubation, 100 ml PBS was used to wash the cells once. cells were incubated for 5 days with the post-inoculation medium. an on-farm EMS in each farm was selected for sampling. the farm-1 EMS had an area of 78 m 46 m with an average depth of 1.5 m. the farm-2 EMS had an area of 79 m 73 m and average depth of 0.7 m. farm-1 was completely depopulated on September 28, 2014, and farm-2 was depopulated on October 8, 2014. shedding continued for another two consecutive weeks if samples were negative or showed low positivity. EMS samples were taken weekly before EMS were emptied. in farm-1 EMS, data loggers were placed at three depths to continuously record the temperature and pH throughout the sampling period. however, in farm-2 EMS, data loggers were only placed at a single depth at three different locations due to shallow depth of the EMS. the samplers were disassembled and the exteriors/interiors of all components were pressure washed prior to collecting the next set of samples. the manure samples were subdivided into vials and placed in the cooler with dry ice for transport back to the laboratory for testing. the gross appearances of EMS samples from different layers showed more liquid in the top layer while the bottom layer had more solid fraction. a 500 bp of spike gene fragment that included sequence variation between PEDv strain OH1414 (virulent PEDv) and PEDv strain OH851 (variant PEDv) was synthesized. a 10-fold serial dilution was run on the real-time RT-PCR assay. the detection limit was two copies for both variant and virulent strains of PEDv. triplicate for each EMS sample were also subjected for duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. generated Cq values were transformed into copy numbers in 1ml of EMS sample. the resulted copy numbers were further transformed into copy numbers. the virus titers were expressed as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml. higher TCID50 values were indicative of higher infectivity of virus. in farm-2, pigs were actively shedding PEDv and 100% of tested pit and fecal samples were positive to virulence PEDv strain with average viral loads of 2.4 106 copies/ml of manure mix. no variant-INDEL strain was detected in this study. layer of the EMS remained at the range of 6\u201310.5\u00b0C until mid-November. the bottom layer had the lowest pH ranging from 6.8 to 7.2. the top layer had the highest pH ranging from 7.5 to 8.4. the middle layer had a pH of 7.2\u20138.3. viral load significantly increased after the third week of sampling in all three layers of the EMS. on average, the viral load ranged from 6.3 103 to 3.3 104 copies/ml of EMS during the first 3 weeks. however, that significantly increased (P 0.05) to 4.3 104\u20131.4 105 during the last 4 weeks. viral load increased (P 0.05) significantly in the early spring (May 2015) ranging, on average, from 3.53 105 to 1.12 106 copies/ml of EMS in the bottom and bottom layers. however, the viral load significantly declined by mid-summer (july 2015) ranging, on average, from 1.02 104 to 5.76 104 copies/ml of EMS in the top and bottom layers, respectively. samples from selected weeks were inoculated in VERO cell culture farm-2 EMS, infective virus was found in both top and bottom layers during the fall sampling. but only samples from the bottom layer of the EMS were found to be infective with a low titer of 102 TCID50. the EMS in the fall samples and the first week (May 8th) of spring sample. but there was a significant difference in the second week (May 21st) of spring sample (P = 0.01; Table 4). ulence PEDv strain occurred in barn A, 1 and 2 weeks before barn was depopulated (5 and 15%, respectively), whereas no viral shedding was detected in barn B. in farm-2, pigs were actively shedding PEDv and 100% of tested pit and fecal samples were positive to virulence PEDv strain. the temperature of the top and middle layers of the EMS declined to 4\u20138\u00b0C by Oct 25th, followed by the second decline by mid-November to 0\u20132\u00b0C. the bottom layer of the EMS also had the lowest pH ranging from 6.8 to 7.2. the top layer had the highest pH ranging from 7.5 to 8.4 while the middle layer had a pH of 7.2\u20138.3. in farm-1 EMS, 97% of tested EMS samples were PEDv positive only for virulent PEDv (subgenogroup 2a) whereas no sample was detected for the variant-INDEL strain. viral load significantly increased after the third week of sampling in all three layers of the EMS. after a long winter incubation, the viral load increased (P 0.05) significantly in the early spring (May 2015) ranging, on average, from 3.53 105 to 1.12 106 copies/ml of EMS in the bottom and top layers of the EMS. however, the viral load significantly declined (P 0.05) by mid-summer (July 2015) ranging, on average, from 1.02 104 to 5.76 104 copies/ml of EMS in the top and bottom infective virus was found in both top and bottom layers during the fall sampling. in farm-2 EMS, the virus was found in both top and bottom layers during the fall sampling. both infectivity percentage and titer showed no significant difference between top and bottom layer of the EMS in the fall samples and the first week (May 8th) of spring sample. however, there was a significant difference in the second week (May 21st) of spring sample. transport vehicles for swine, contaminated air and feed ingredients have been shown to contain the genetic material of PEDv. most viruses cannot survive long in the environment, outside their host. however, viruses under the Coronaviridae family show high survivability. experimentally, it was demonstrated that PEDv has high survivability in the infected manure. however, so far there has been no epidemiological investigation of PEDv survivability in the infected manure over time in the environment. the stability of coronaviruses at various temperatures appears to be dependent on the nature of surrounded environmental conditions. the survival time of most viruses in infected manure is highly variable but should be considered in terms of days, weeks, or months. pH variation of pH over time in both studied EMS was not significant. pH of both EMS fell within the range that PEDv could replicate. however, there was no significant direct correlation between pH, temperature, and viral copy numbers. in 1988, Hofmann and Wyler were the first to report replication of PEDv in kidney cells of monkey origin (VERO cells) in 1988, Hofmann and Wyler (1989) were the first to report replication of PEDv in kidney cells of monkey origin. the results obtained from such method may provide an underestimation. contradictory results could be explained by differences in viral shedding status in two farms at the beginning of sampling. the top layer of both EMS had low or no infective PEDv. more research should be carried out to better understand the life cycle of PEDv in the environment, as well as its survivability outside the host. additional studies are needed to monitor the survivability of PEDv in contaminated soils."}
