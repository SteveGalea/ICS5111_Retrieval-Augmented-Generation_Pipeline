{"summary": "the avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are isolated from wild and domestic birds all over the world. the APMVs are divided into nine serotypes (APMV 1 to 9) based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays. a single-stranded RNA genome of 13\u201319 kb is divided into two subfamilies. the subfamily Paramyxoviridae is divided into five genera: Respirovirus (including Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3), Rubulavirus (including parainfluenza virus 5), Morbillivirus (including measles and canine distemper viruses), Henipavirus (comprising Hendra and APMV-4 strains have been isolated from chickens, ducks and geese. APMV-5 causes disease in budgerigars that is characterized by depression, dyspnoea, diarrhea and high mortality. APMV-6 and -7 cause mild respiratory disease in turkeys and are associated with a drop in egg production. a cynomolgus monkey with respiratory disease recovered an APMV-3-like virus from pigs. we recently showed that APMV-2 to -9 are competent to infect and replicate to low-to-moderate titers in mice and hamsters. however, rodents are uncertain predictors of performance in other species such as humans. the reverse genetics system for APMV-2, -4, and -7 will be used for the development of APMV vectored vaccines. adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mullatta) were obtained from the NIAID breeding colony located on Morgan Island, SC. all animals are transported in accordance with USDA guidelines and permits. biologically-derived wt APMV-2 strain chicken/Yucaipa/California/56 [8]. a recombinant derivative of wt APMV-2, called rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa), in which its natural cleavage site was replaced by the cleavage site RRRRRF. all the APMV serotypes except ser. otype 5 were grown in the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs. the allantoic fluids from infected eggs were collected 72 h post-inoculation and virus titers were determined by hemagglutination (HA) assay. APMV strains, F protein cleavage sites, and protease dependence. the animals were confirmed to be seronegative for APMV serotypes. the rhesus macaques (4 animals per virus) were infected by the combined intranasal and intratracheal routes using a 1 ml inoculum per site containing 106.0 PFU per mL of the indicated virus. the 50 percent egg infectious dose (EID50) virus titer (expressed as log10 EID50 per mL) was determined by titration in Vero cells, followed by neuramindase (NA) assay. serum antibody levels to the specific APMV serotype used for immunization were evaluated pre- and post-immunization by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. APMV-5 strain budgerigar/Kunitachi/74 was used as the source of NA. dilutions of serum samples were prepared in 20 l volumes of enzyme buffer. ten microliters of 12.5% dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well. the extent of the reaction was quantified by fluorometry at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. readings from substrate blanks were subtracted from the virus sample readings. the average background-corrected NA activity was calculated from 12 independent wells. partially purified APMV (5 g per lane) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Membrane strips were incubated with a 1500 dilution of day 0 and day 28 serum samples from each individual monkey from each group. the hemagglutinin (HN), fusion (F0 and F1) nucleocapsid (NP), phophoprotein (P) and matrix (M) proteins specific to a particular APMV chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1) and vero cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) nine APMV strains were used in this study, all of which had been constructed in previous work. all the APMV serotypes except serotype 5 were grown in the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. the samples were inoculated in triplicate onto 24-well plates of DF-1 or Vero cells at 80% confluency. rhesus macaques were infected using a 1 ml inoculum per site containing 106.0 PFU per mL of the indicated virus. the animals were confirmed to be seronegative for APMV serotypes by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and plaque reduction assays. dilutions 100, 101, 102, 103 and 104 (0.1 ml each) were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. eggs were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 days. each serum sample was allowed to cool to room temperature. 100 l of packed chicken RBCs were added. each dilution was combined with 4 HA units of a particular live APMV serotype. ten microliters of each serum and virus mixture were transferred in duplicate to the assay plate. 10 l of diluted virus or enzyme buffer alone were used as positive and negative controls. the reaction mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min with shaking. volume of the virus-serum mixture from each serum dilution was added to approximately 150 l of medium in quadruplicate wells of DF-1 (for APMV-2, -3, -4 and -9) or Vero (for APMV-5 and -7) cells. plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h and were scored for virus replication based on HA activity. rAPMV-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -9 were biologically derived wt viruses. the remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4, and -7 respectively. none of the animals exhibited any clinical signs of illness or distress. APMV-5 was determined by a limiting dilution assay on Vero cells in which virus-infected wells were detected by NA activity. a limiting dilution assay on Vero cells in which virus-infected wells were detected by NA activity. rAPMV-4/Fc-Bc 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 wt APMV-4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and wt APMV-5 were detected in nasal washes from all 4 animals on day 1, from 1 animal on day 3, 2 animals on day 5 and from 1 animal on day 7. the highest mean daily titer was detected on day 1. shedding of wt APMV-3 was detected in 3 of 4 animals. 1 animal shed low titers of virus consecutively from days 1 to 6. 2 animals shed detectable virus only on single days. rAPMV-7 was isolated from all inoculated animals on day 1. wt rAPMV-4/Fc-BC was detected on day 2 in 2 inoculated animals. rAPMV-4/Fc-BC had not been detected in nasal wash specimens. rAPMV-2 was detected on days 2 and/or 4 in BALs of 3 of 4 inoculated animals. 2.5 2.5 \u2013 7.9 2 2.5 1.5 1.8 \u2013 6.2 3 2.5 2.3 0.8 \u2013 6.0 4 2.5 1.5 1.5 0.8 \u2013 5.2 Mean 2.5 1.9 1.5 0.4 6.3 wt APMV-3 1 2.5 1.8 1.5 \u2013 6.2 2 1.5 1.5 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 3.8 3 2.3 2.3 1.3 \u2013 6.3 4 2.5 1.5 \u2013 \u2013 4.8 Mean 2.2 1.8 0.9 0.4 5.3 wt rAPMV-4 1 1.8 the 50 percent egg infectious dose (EID50) virus titer (expressed as log10 EID50 per mL) was determined as described in materials and methods. limit of detection was 0.8 log10 per mL. rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa) and wt APMV7 showed the most consistent replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of rhesus macaques. no virus shedding was detected from the upper or lower respiratory tract for any of the viruses after day 7 post-infection. only one of the viruses tested, namely wt APMV-5, could not be detected nasal washes or BAL from any of the inoculated animals. serum antibody titers were determined by a modified HI assay using chicken erythrocytes. all animals were confirmed to be seronegative for APMV-specific antibodies on day 1. the highest mean HI antibody titers were observed in rhesus macaques immunized wt APMV-2 (7.00 log2 1.4) rAPMV-4 1 3 4 7 2 0 0 6 3 0 0 5 4 4 4 6 Mean 1.82.1 2.02.3 6.00.8 rAPMV-4/Fc-Bc 1 0 0 4 2 4 4 4 6 3 0 0 4 4 3 3 5 Mean 2.51.7 2.51.7 1.51.7 wt APMV-7 1 5 5 3 2 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 Mean 5.30.5 all the day 0 serum samples were 0.

APMV serotypes 2 to 9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds. APMV serotypes 2 to 9 are frequently isolated from both domestic and wild birds. APMV-1 (NDV) is the most extensively characterized due to its importance as a major pathogen of poultry. six of these were wt viruses representing six different serotypes. we chose wt APMV-2, -5, -7 and wt rAPMV-4. this property is known to correlate with pantropic replication and virulence by NDV in chickens. rhesus macaques infected with APMV-2, -3, -4, -5, -7 and -9 showed no signs of any disease. APMV-4 and -5 replicated to low titers in upper respiratory tract. compared to NDV, wt and recombinant APMV-2 and 7 and wt APMV-3 replicate more efficiently in the lower respiratory tract in non-human primates. analysis of fecal samples of rhesus macaques infected with all these APMVs revealed no shedding. the introduction of the multi-basic sites increased virus replication in vitro. there was no observed difference in replication or pathogenicity in chickens. a single inoculation via combined intranasal and intratracheal routes in rhesus macaques. the HI titers correlated either completely or partially with the level of shedding from the lower respiratory tract except in the case of wt APMV-5. wt APMV-3, rAPMV-4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and wt APMV-9 were low. wt APMV-5 has only been isolated from budgerigars. rAPMV-2 (type 1 africa) was lower than that induced by NDV in a previous study [52]. the HI antibody titers were lower than that induced by NDV in a previous study [52] suggesting that these serotypes are less promising. we have evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of APMVs in non-human primates."}
