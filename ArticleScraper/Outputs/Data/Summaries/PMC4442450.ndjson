{"summary": "phosphorylation of viral capsid proteins regulates both subcellular localization and functions including transcriptional regulation, viral uncoating, and nucleic acid chaperone activity (7\u201313) phosphorylation of viral capsid proteins regulates both subcellular localization and functions including transcriptional regulation, viral uncoating, and nucleic acid chaperone activity (7\u201313) in HSV-1, the hexons and pentons consist of 6 and 5 molecules of VP5, respectively. the triplexes consist of one VP19C and two VP23 molecules. the portal complex consists of 12 molecules of UL6, the SCP is VP26. yK490(VP26/EGFP) with the VP26 null mutation and expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed using the Red-mediated mutagenesis procedure. yK491(VP26/EGFP) with the VP26 null mutation was disrupted by replacing VP26 codons 10 to 102 with a kanamycin resistance gene. YK493(VP26/TA-repair/EGFP), a virus in which both YK491(VP26/EGFP) and YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP are repaired and which expresses EGFP, was constructed by cotransfection of rabbit skin cells with transfer plasmid pBS-VP26T111A. infectious viruses obtained from the cotransfection were passaged two times in human neuroblastoma SK-N pBS-VP26-kpn+, pBS-VP26T111A, and pBS-VP26T111D-bam+, described above, were constructed as follows. pBS-VP26-kpn+, pBS-VP26T111A, and pBS-VP26T111D-bam+, described above, were constructed as follows. pBS-VP26 was constructed by PCR cloning the domain containing the line 1, the wild-type HSV-1(F) genome; line 2, the wild-type HSV-1(YK333) genome carrying an expression cassette for EGFP in the intergenic region between UL3 and UL4. line 3, the domain carrying the UL34, UL35(VP26) and UL36(VP1/2) open reading frames; lines 4 to 7, genomes of recombinant viruses with a mutation in the UL35(VP26) gene. phosphorylation of VP26 Thr-111 has only been detected in SK-N-SH cells. phosphoproteomic analysis of titanium dioxide affinity chromatography-enriched phosphopeptides from SK-N-SH cells infected with wild-type HSV-1(F) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 24 h with high-accuracy mass spectrometry. the level of progeny virus yield in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1(F) was restored to that in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1(F) the progeny virus yield in cells infected with YK493(VP26T111A/EGFP) was 7.1-fold less than that in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1(F) 333(EGFP), YK491(VP26/EGFP), YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP), YK493(VP26/TA-Repair/EGFP), or YK494(VP26T111D/EGFP) were infected with YK333(EGFP) and YK493(VP26/TA-Repair/EGFP. phosphorylation of VP26 Thr-111 is survival was significantly higher in mice infected with YK491(VP26/EGFP) or YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP) than in mice infected with YK493(VP26/TA-Repair/EGFP. survival of mice infected with YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP) was significantly lower than that of mice infected with YK491(VP26T111A/EGFP) level of VP26 expression in cells infected with YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP) was significantly lower than that in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1(F) or YK493(VP26/TA-Repair/EGFP) the VP26 T111D mutation restored the VP26 expression downregulated by the VP26 T111A mutation in part. infected cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to VP26 or -tubulin. each value is the mean standard error of triplicate experiments and is expressed relative to the mean value of wild-type SK-N-SH cells treated with DMSO. phosphorylation of VP26 Thr-111 regulates subcellular localization of VP5 in HSV-1-infected cells. SK-N-SH cells were infected with wild-type HSV-1(F), YK491(VP26/EGFP), YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP), YK493(VP26/TA-repair/EGFP), or YK494(VP26T111D/EG in cells infected with YK492(VP26T111A/EGFP), VP5 (60%) and VP26 (50%) were detected as punctate structures in the nucleus and mostly colocalized in these nuclear structures. these results suggest that localization of VP5 and VP26 is regulated by phosphorylation at VP26 Thr-111 in HSV-1-infected cells. a phosphomimetic mutation in VP26 abolishes the phosphorylation of VP26 Thr-111. this reduced HSV-1 replication and cell-cell spread in SK-N-SH cells. this is the first report showing the significance of phosphorylation of a herpesvirus protein in viral replication and pathogenesis. VP26 homologs of pseudorabies virus (PRV) were required for efficient neuroinvasion in mice following intracranial inoculation (45) VP26 Thr-111 phosphorylation regulates HSV-1 replication and pathogenesis (42) tagging of VP26 with FPs may have caused steric hindrance in VP26. this may have contributed to VP26 loss of function. phosphorylation of a protein can cause conformational changes (46) the phosphorylation site of HSV-1 UL47 impaired nuclear localization only in some cells (34) blocking the phosphorylation of VP26 Thr-111 may cause a subtle imbalance among the factors that determine the localization of VP26 in infected cells."}
