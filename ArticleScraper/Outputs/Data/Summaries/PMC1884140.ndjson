{"summary": "a polymorphism in the activating component of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NCF1) has previously been identified as a regulator of arthritis severity in mice and rats. this discovery resulted in a search for NADPH oxidase-activating substances as a potential new approach to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. treatment of arthritis-susceptible rats with an NADPH oxidase-activating substance, phytol, protects against arthritis. the treatment led to a restoration of the oxidative-burst effect and induction of a strikingly similar IFN-dependent pathway. RA is a chronic and severely disabling disease of unknown etiology. new therapies are hampered by the heterogeneity of RA and the complexity of its molecular pathology. linkage-association studies are now giving results in the form of successful identification of autoimmunity-regulating genes. new therapies will eventually lead to a greater understanding of the molecular regulation of this complex disease. inguinal lymph nodes obtained 10 days after subcutaneous administration were analyzed. a biodistribution analysis of phytol was performed to determine which tissue and time point would be most relevant to investigate. a group of interesting genes was selected and verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis in three separate biological experiments. gene-expression profiling experiments were performed on inguinal lymph nodes from rats with pharmacologically (phytol) and genetically modified NADPH oxidase activity. the in vivo distribution of phytol was analyzed and examined by subcutaneous injection of tritium-labeled phytol into the base of the tail in DA rats. a large fraction of phytol remained as a depot in the injection site. the distribution of phytol to the inguinal lymph nodes showed the highest accumulation > 1 week after injection and showed a reduction after 2 weeks. values are means from groups of four animals. the expression of 29 genes was significantly changed (p 0.05, with absolute fold change > 1.4) of these 29 genes, 13 showed expression in phytol-treated rats, whereas 16 genes showed higher expression in pristane-treated rats

significantly increased expression (p 0.05) compared with pristane (Figure 5). expression levels then decreased to the same low level as for the pristane-treated rats. levels of significance were calculated using Student's t-test. the increased expression of Ifn coincided with the most pronounced increase in expression of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Oas1, Mx2 and S100a9. the expression levels of the studied type I interferons were very low and that the difference in expression levels could only be detected using quantitative real-time PCR. nf and IL-1 is increased in macrophages activated by IFN- to act synergistically with IFN- in initiating a chronic inflammatory response. only a small decrease in the expression of Tnf and IL-1 could be observed after phytol administration. the expression of IL-1 was below the detection limit. expression of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2, Oas1 and S100a9 were all induced by phytol, compared with untreated controls. no significant difference between the strains was observed for S100a9. the expression level of Ifn in DA rats after pristane injection was comparable with that of untreated control rats. however, after phytol administration, the level of Ifn was increased to a level equal to that of DA.Ncf1E3 rats. the levels of different cell populations in the studied tissue may affect the outcome of gene-expression profiling. f1E3 (filled bars) of (A) B

MMP12 (matrix metalloproteinase 12) belongs to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [28], which are involved in cell migration and degradation of cartilage and bone by remodeling the extracellular matrix. the protein 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-1 belongs to the OAS family. it was one of the first groups of IFN-induced antiviral proteins to be characterized. it is induced by the IFN type I pathway, which is activated upon pathogenic invasion as part of an antiviral response. CXCL9 is a chemokine belonging to the CXC subfamily of chemokines acting through G-protein-coupled receptors. these proteins have chemoattraction and growth-promoting properties and are induced by IFN- and, to some extent, TNF- to attract T cells to sites of inflammation. IRF7 was recently reported to be the master regulator of IFN type I-dependent immune responses [36], and recent publications have shown that an IRF5 polymorphism is strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) the protein 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-1 belongs to the OAS family, which was one of the first groups of IFN-induced antiviral proteins to be characterized. differentially expressed genes bioinformatic tools were used to assign pathways for these genes. a third biological experiment was performed to analyze how the expression of the selected genes varies over time. stane-treated or phyto-treated animals were studied. inguinal lymph nodes were isolated at 0, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 19 days after injection. levels of significance were calculated using Student's t-test. all genes associated with increased expression after phytol administration showed significantly increased expression (p 0.05) compared with pristane (Figure 5) in the early disease-onset period (day 8\u201310). expression levels then decreased to the same low level as for the pristane-treated rats. RNA samples from all four experiments were analyzed for Ifn and Ifn expression levels in DA rats treated with either pristane (n = 19) or phytol (n = 18) the increased expression of Ifn coincided with the most pronounced increase in expression of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Oas1, Mx2 and S100a9, i.e. day 8\u201310 after treatment. s were calculated using Student's t-test (*p 0.05) the expression of Tnf and IL-1 is increased in macrophages activated by IFN- to act synergistically with IFN- in initiating a chronic inflammatory response. only a small decrease in the expression of Tnf and IL-1 could be observed after phytol administration. values are means SEM of 4\u20135 animals per group. expression of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2, Oas1 and S100a9 were all induced by phytol, compared with untreated controls. the expression of Ifn was significantly higher (p 0.01) for the rats injected with pristane than for both control and phytol-treated rats. the expression level of Ifn was comparable with that of untreated control rats. however, after phytol administration, the level of Ifn was increased to a level equal to that of DA.Ncf1E3 rats. the differentially expressed genes assigned to the Ifn pathway are unlikely to be the result of differences in these cell populations. comparison between DA (open bars) and DA.Ncf1E3 (filled bars) of (A) B cells, (B) T cells and (C) NK cells. a further difficulty is the need for biological replicates and the genetic heterogeneity involved in human studies. this has led to some skepticism regarding the utility of gene-expression profiling as a method to achieve an understanding of rheumatic diseases [55]. however, recent analysis of gene-expression fingerprints of individual patients with RA might give hope for this still technically evolving method for understanding complex disorders [56-59]. pristane (arthritis inducer [21]) and phytol (NADPH oxidase-activating and arthritis-ameliorating compound [20] were identified. the pristane-induced pathway was marked by increased expression of Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12 (Table 1). these genes all share IFN- as a common regulator [30,61,62], which was also shown to be upregulated in the inguinal lymph nodes. the inflammatory arthritis that is induced by an injection with pristane is characterized by increased expression of the Ifn-connected signature genes Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12. the inflammatory arthritis that is induced by an injection with pristane is characterized by increased expression of the Ifn-connected signature genes Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12. the common inducers of these are IFN- and IFN-. a clear tendency in the expression of Ifn between DA and DA.Ncf1E3 strains was observed after injection with pristane. the DA.Ncf1E3 rats had higher expression of Ifn than the DA rats. this difference in expression level clearly resembles the differences observed for the phytol-induced genes Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2 and Oas1. despite the similarities in expression pattern, it must be noted that the study was performed on tissues other than inguinal lymph nodes and established disease, so that differences in gene profiles could be caused by tissue differences or time-dependent regulation. however, the fact that the present study points towards a disease-ameliorating pathway that is regulated by IFN-. increased expression of S100a9 was observed in rats treated with phytol. however, the expression profile was not similar to that of Ifn. DA rats used in the microarray analysis, the first verifying quantitative real-time PCR study, the time study and the biodistribution study were purchased from Harlan Netherlands. all animals were kept in a climate-controlled environment with 12-hour light/dark cycles. animals were free from common pathogens including Sendai virus, Hantaan virus, coronavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus and Mycoplasma pulmonalis. DA rats were injected with 200 L phytol (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with tritiated phytol to a final dose of 167 Ci/rat. the inguinal lymph nodes were surgically removed and stored in a tissue-storage reagent. the inguinal lymph nodes were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice to Quest Pharmaceutical Services (Newark, DE, USA) the frozen lymph nodes were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) embedding media (VWR international, Bristol, CT, USA) for cryosectioning. sections of 10 m thickness were heated at 50\u00b0C for 10 minutes, coated with photographic emulsion. the average ratio between 28S/18S rRNA was 2.2, indicating high RNA quality. all RNA and cDNA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. the mean log2 intensity for each group was calculated by subtracting the mean log2 intensity for the pristane-treated animals from that for the phytol-treated animals. the total number of probe sets in the used rat Affymetrix chips was 15 923, and the average present call was 45%. alias 36B4) was used as endogenous control [84]. UniGene Gene name FP/RP Sequence (5'-3' was used for quantitative real-time PCR. DA rats were free from common pathogens including Sendai virus, Hantaan virus, coronavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus and Mycoplasma pulmonalis. the animals were kept in a climate-controlled environment with 12-hour light/dark cycles. phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecene-1-ol) were injected into the rats (age 8\u201312 weeks) by a single subcutaneous injection of 200 L at the base of the tail. arthritis development was monitored with a macroscopic scoring system of the four limbs ranging from 0 to 15. the scores of the four paws were added, yielding a maximum total score of 60 for each rat. in the global gene-expression profiling and the first verifying quantitative real-time PCR experiment, five rats per group were used. all rats were killed at 0, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 19 days after injection. microautoradiography was performed on three individual rats 10 days after subcutaneous administration with tritiated phytol (167 Ci/rat) the frozen lymph nodes were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice to Quest Pharmaceutical Services (Newark, DE, USA) RNA isolation Total RNA from inguinal lymph nodes was isolated using a commercial kit (RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit; Qiagen, Germany) the protocol for animal tissues was followed with the addition of the optional DNase digestion (RNase-Free DNase Set; Qiagen) the average ratio between 28S/18S rRNA was 2.2. the data were analyzed using specific sofware. the intensities were log2 transformed and the mean log2 intensity for each group calculated. the mean log2 fold change was calculated for the phytol-treated animals versus the pristane-treated animals.
