{"summary": "the recurrence of malaria in primigravidae women is caused by the interaction between the parasite-expressed VAR2CSA antigen and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space and lack of protective antibodies. a vaccine against PM will induce antibody-mediated immune responses that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes in the placenta. the ideal animal model mimics the human immunological response, the pathogen infection pathway, and allows analysis of the mechanism of the vaccine-induced protective immune response. the development of a recombinant vaccine is initiated with identification and selection of an antigen that induces a desired immune response. multiple antigens are tested, which requires an inexpensive and easy to handle animal model. a potential animal model for studying protection induced by immunizations with recombinant domains of PfEMP1 could be chimpanzees. most malaria antigens are produced by recombinant technology and tested in lower mammalian species, such as rodents and rabbits. all single recombinant domains of VAR2CSA-FCR3 were used in immunizations of mice, rats and rabbits. compared to responses raised against the full length recombinant protein. levels of antigen-specific IgG from immunized animals were measured using ELISA. reactivity of recombinant proteins from mice (A), rats (B) and rabbits (C) immunized with individual domains (DBL1X-DBL6) and FV2 is shown as the mean of all animals immunized with a particular protein. data are fitted to a sigmoid shaped dose response curve. expression of VAR2CSA and sex specific recognition by IgG from human serum compared to male and Danish serum. reactivity against native VAR2CSA on the surface of the IE was higher in sera from animals immunized with DBL5 and DBL6, the reactivity against DBL1X, DBL2X, DBL3X and DBL4 was low. escence values (MFI) was correlated to the EC50 titer values for all single domains. the linear dependency for rats was somewhat lower. we found high levels of concordance between antibody reactivity against the recombinant domains and reactivity against the native protein. anti-VAR2CSA serum from rats and rabbits raised against DBL1X-DBL6 and FV2 were tested using FCR3-IE for the ability of serum used in a 110 dilution to inhibit binding to CSA. BL6 specific antibodies also were highly reactive against native VAR2CSA. the pattern of antigenicity when immunizing with FV2 was similar to immunizations with single domains. in rats, FV2 antibodies targeted all DBL-domains with similar reactivity. the levels of reactivity were more or less in line with the reactivity against the native protein of single-domain specific antibodies. the overall level of reactivity was lower in rabbit serum (n = 4) compared to rat serum (n = 10) and a lower proportion of the rabbits reacted with a given peptide. in general, the same areas of the linear sequence were targeted by IgG from the rats and rabbits. however, it appeared that the rat antibody reactivity was skewed one to three peptides N-terminally compared to rabbit antibodies. es in individual serum samples from rats (n = 10) (Dash dot line) and rabbits (n = 4) (Solid line) immunized with DBL4 recombinant protein is measured using ELISA. the average reactivity to linear peptides covering the amino acid sequence of DBL4 was slightly skewed, but otherwise remarkably similar between rabbits and rats. in rabbits, the seven tested antigens produced IgG responses. the DBL6, DBL5 and FV2 produced a high antibody response. IgG responses to DBL1X, DBL2X, DBL3X and DBL4 domains were lower and essentially similar. erythrocytes infected with the FCR3 parasite line were used in flow-cytometry to test the reactivity in animal sera against native VAR2CSA. the parasite cultures were continuously selected for binding to CSA by panning on beWo cells, resulting in surface expression of VAR2CSA. the antibody reactivity against native VAR2CSA on the surface of the IE differed both with respect to animal species, and with antigen type. serum from animals immunized with DBL3VAR1 and a blank sample without serum. the mean fluorescence values (MFI) was correlated to the EC50 titer values for all single domains. the linear dependency for rats was somewhat lower. anti-VAR2CSA serum from rats and rabbits raised against DBL1X-DBL6 and FV2 were tested using FCR3-IE for the ability of serum used in a 110 dilution to inhibit binding to CSA. the level of inhibition was sustained in the IgG preparations at 0.5 mg/ml. reactivity against individual DBL-domains in serum from animals immunized with FV2 was similar to immunizations with single domains. in rats, FV2 antibodies targeted all DBL-domains with similar reactivity. in rabbits, the reactivity against the domains appeared to be overall lower than for rats. IgG induced by DBL4 immunizations reacted with the DBL4 peptides. overall level of reactivity was lower in rabbit serum (n = 4) compared to rat serum (n = 10) and a lower proportion of the rabbits reacted with a given peptide. however, it appeared that the rat antibody reactivity was skewed one to three peptides N-terminally compared to rabbit antibodies. the average reactivity to linear peptides covering the amino acid sequence of DBL4 was, apparently slightly skewed, but otherwise remarkably similar between rabbits and rats. a vaccine based on a single domain is more likely to be feasible, due to the complexity and size of the antigen. reactivity to native protein increased towards the C-terminal end of the external part of VAR2CSA, both in immunizations with single domains and FV2. this may reflect both an inherent antigenicity of single DBL domains of VAR2CSA and/or accessibility of single domains in the native VAR2CSA molecule. rat and rabbit strains used were outbred, reducing the likelihood that all of the individual rats and none of the rabbits induced functional antibodies. in addition, fair levels of antibodies was induced against the recombinant form of DBL4 in rabbits, indicating appropriate T-cell responses during the immunizations. a fraction of the expressed PfEMP1 during the maturation of the parasite in the IE remains intracellular. a fraction of the expressed PfEMP1 during the maturation of the parasite in the IE remains intracellular. the immunogenicity of the VAR2CSA protein is highest in the C terminal end. identification of the epitopes targeted both by FV2 and DBL4 specific binding inhibitory antibodies may serve as a tool to generate second-generation antigens. all isolates were mycoplasma negative and were regularly genotyped using nested GLURP and MSP-2 primers in a single PCR step. var2csa was based on a codon optimized synthetic DNA fragment as described [18] control groups were immunized with the DBL3-VAR1-FCR3 in the same concentration as the tested VAR2CSA proteins [15]. groups of BALB/c mice (n = 8) (inbred) were subcutaneously immunized with 15 g per animal of recombinant protein in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by three follow-up immunizations of 10 g of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at two-week interval ELISA plates (Nunc Immunoplate) were coated with protein overnight (4\u00b0C) at a concentration of 1 g/ml in 1 PBS. the plates were blocked with ELISA dilution buffer (1% BSA and 1% Triton x-100) before the serial diluted serum was added to the plate. the parasite culture was enriched for late trophozoite and schizont stage parasites in a strong magnetic field (MACS, Miltenyi) Aliquots of 2105 IE in a total volume of 100 l were labelled by ethidium bromide and sequentially exposed to (1) 15 l animal serum and (2) 1100 dilutions of FITC labelled secondary antibodies specific for IgG from the individual species. the inhibitory capacity of the induced VAR2CSA domain-specific IgG was measured using a standardized Petri dish method. this was due to the smaller volume in this assay, and because this a more commonly used assay [40]\u2013[42]. peptide array consisted of 66 synthetic 16\u201328 amino acids long overlapping peptides spanning amino acids 1607\u20131989 of the P. falciparum-FCR3 var2csa sequence. purity of the peptides was expected to be 70% or higher. ELISA plates were coated overnight (4\u00b0C) with DBL4 peptides at a concentration of 3 g/ml in 1 PBS. pad Prism5 (Gradhpad Software Inc.) was used in the following analysis: one way ANOVA tests followed by multiple pair wise comparison procedures (Holm-Sidak method) the Pearson correlation test was used to assess the correlation between MFI values and OD-EC50 values. linearized Bakpak6 baculovirus DNA was co-transfected with pAcGP67-A into Sf9 insect cells for generation of recombinant virus particles. full-length protein VAR2CSA (FV2) and six VAR2CSA DBL-domains were produced corresponding to the following amino acid number in VAR2CSA. seven groups of Wistar rats (outbred) were immunized with 40 g of recombinant protein in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by three booster injections of 20 g of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 212-week intervals. for each recombinant protein one rabbit was immunized with the exception of rabbits receiving DBL2x & FV2 (n = 2) and DBL4 & DBL5 (n = 3 anti-rabbit-IgG 12000 (P0448, Dako), anti-mouse-IgG 12000 (P0260, Dako), and anti-rat-IgG 13000 (A9037, Sigma) optical density was measured at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader. each column was coated with 0.5 mg/ml of a DBL-domain. data from 5000 infected cells (ethidium bromide positive) was collected on a FC500 flowcytometer (Beckman Coulter) the median FITC fluorescence intensity was determined using Winlist Software (Verity Software House) parasite suspension was pre-incubated with both animal sera and purified IgG at different concentrations at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. unbound erythrocytes were removed by washing with PBS on a gyro-turntable (Stuart) until spots were clear of blood. ilution buffer (1% BSA and 1% Triton x-100) before animal serum samples were added. anti-rabbit P0448 (DAKO), dilution 12000; anti-rat A9037 (Invitrogen) and diluted 13000. optical density was measured at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader. reactivity in ELISA to single DBL-domains and FV2 performed for each species of animal separately."}
