{"summary": "the aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. the majority of infected patients (94%) were less than 40 y. the rates of admission and pneumonia were 8.4% (373/4,463) and 2.5% (116/4,463). the 2009 H1N1 flu was the first pandemic in the 21st century. in the 20th century, 3 pandemics were documented: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu and 1968 Hong Kong flu. the mortality rate of the 2009 H1N1 flu was far less than that of previous pandemics. in this study, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 flu. we tried to explain the reasons of the epidemiological characteristics of the 2009 H1N1 flu, including the lower mortality rate in healthy persons. the 0-15 y group, the 16-40 y group, the 41-64 y group and the 65 y group were treated in the department of paediatrics. the first day of fever and/or severe respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea were regarded as the first day of illness. children and young adults comprised the majority of the patients (94%) in total, 48.4% of the patients were in the 0-10 y group (2,160), 29,8% were in the 11-20 y group (1,329), 10% were in the 21-30 y group (447), and 5.8% were in the 31-40 y group (258). over three quarters of cases occurred during a single month (October 18th-November 14th) this pattern was similar in both the children and adults. median age of the 373 hospitalized patients was 10 y (range 2 mo- 86 y, mean 19.4 20.1 y), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.1:1 (196/177). pneumonia was detected in 31.3% (116/373) of the admitted patients, and 2.6% (116/4,463) of the total infected patients. no children were treated in the intensive care unit, but six adult patients were treated in the intensive care unit. the admitted patients according to age (n = 373) Age groups 0-15 y (n = 217) 16-40 y (n = 100) 41-64y (n = 35) 65 y (n = 21) P Clinical Characteristics Age, mean (y) 6.2 3.7 25.2 7 51.9 6.7 74 5 0.001 Male/female 132/85 45/55 14/21 5/16 0.001 Duration of fever (d) Before admission 2.0 1.9 2.0 1.1 1.7 1.5 the adult patients with pneumonia had higher leukocytes counts, CRP and ESR values with lower lymphocyte differentials than the adults without pneumonia. the adult patients with pneumonia had higher leukocytes counts, CRP and ESR values with lower lymphocyte differentials than the adults without pneumonia. 1.2 2.1 1.5 NS Total 3.2 2.9 3.9 2.3 NS Hospitalization (d) 5.2 2.9 7.9 3.8 0.001 Oseltamivir, 48 h* 103 (86.7) 29 (80.6) NS Laboratory findings Haemoglobin (g/dL) 13.4 2.0 12.5 2.1 0.02 Leukocyte (109//L) 6.2 2.4 7.9 3.5 0.009 Neutrophil (%) 64 15 76 12 0.001 children and young adults comprised the majority of the patients (94%) there was a decreasing trend in the number of patients older than 41 y as increased age. the 65 y group comprised only 0.9% (42) of the total patients. six adult patients were infected within 48 h of fever onset. four of the infected patients were pregnant women. no children were treated in the intensive care unit. the frequency of underlying diseases of the admitted patients was significantly different among age groups. many patients had more than one underlying diseases and these patients were more prevalent in older groups. the underlying diseases of the admitted patients are shown in Table 3. 0.8 7.6 3.2 0.001 Neutrophil (%) 63 19 66 15 71 14 64 17 NS Lymphocyte (%) 27 17 23 13 20 12 24 14 0.037 Monocyte (%) 9 4 8 4 8 4 9 4 NS Platelet (109/L) 1.6 2.0 2.4 3.8 3.8 4.6 6.1 6.9 0.001 ESR (mm/h) 17 12 19 17 37 22 42 19 0.001 CRP; C-reactive protein, ESR; the adult patients with pneumonia had higher leukocytes counts, CRP and ESR values with lower lymphocyte differentials than the adults without pneumonia. the adult patients had higher leukocytes counts, CRP and ESR values with lower lymphocyte differentials than the adults without pneumonia. children and young adults (40 y) comprise a predominant portion of the infected patient and older adult groups (> 40-50 y) were possibly protected from this new viral infection. mortality in this pandemic was not higher than for seasonal influenza and was highest in the older adult group. epidemiological studies on measles in the south Pacific islands, including Hawaii, have provided the new insights into new pathogens and herd immunity. epidemiologically, it is well documented that when a new pathogenic virus is introduced into an immune-naive isolated population, nearly all inhabitants of all ages are affected. mortality is paradoxically the highest in the healthiest age-group (20-40 y) with the most active immune function. a significant proportion of the populations can be infected with pandemic influenza, up to 40-50%, based on previous seroprevalence studies. there have been few population based data for infection rates during previous pandemics because of the lack of diagnostic tools such as RT-PCR. male-to-female ratios among those with pneumonia showed a similar trend: 3:1 in the children and 1:2 in the adults. the immunologic reaction to H1N1 virus infection is associated with age and sex. the proportion of older patients with underlying diseases accounted for > 50% of the fatal cases in Korea. we previously reported that the children with pneumonia had higher leukocytes counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia. the results of corticosteroid treatment on severely affected adult ARDS patients are also controversial [38,39]. the effect of corticosteroids on viral replication is controversial. it is unknown whether the virus particle itself or other mediators induce inflammation in lung lesions. the corticosteroids may reduce the systemic immune reaction caused by hyperactive immune cells with hypercytokinemia. the greater than 65 y group had the highest rate of underlying diseases and higher admission rate, pneumonia rate, total duration of fever, and CRP and ESR values than other age groups. these patients may have an immunologic defect that is associated with immunologic consumption by underlying diseases."}
