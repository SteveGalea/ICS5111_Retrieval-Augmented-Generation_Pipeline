{"summary": "calf health was prioritised as one of the most important animal health issues facing the Irish livestock industry in a recent expert study conducted on behalf of animal health Ireland. a group of experts was commissioned to provide evidence-based advice on calf health and disease management to Irish farmers, agricultural advisers and veterinary practitioners. a review series on calf health from birth to weaning has been developed, specifically to provide evidence-based advice on calf health. the lower critical temperature lies in the range of 10-15\u00b0C for calves in the first two weeks of life, declining with age to approximately 6-10\u00b0C in older calves. the quality of bedding material is crucial for the amount of heat loss via conduction in calves lying down [6] there is long-term recognition of the benefit to dairy calf health of outdoor housing in hutches, especially for the prevention of diarrhoea and respiratory disease. fewer days of medication were needed in group-housed calves than in individual housing. mortality was highest in larger calf groups and tended to be lower in small groups. prevalence of both diarrhoea and respiratory disease was twice as high among calves in dynamic compared to stable groups. inadequate ventilation of calf barns increases risk of disease due to build up of high levels of humidity, noxious gases, dust and bacterial content. at least 4 air changes per hour are needed in winter and up to 40 in summer. ventilation is achieved through wind and buoyancy in monopitch houses. weaning management of the suckler calf In suckler herds, calves generally remain with cows at pasture until they are weaned, usually between 5 and 9 months of age. non-integrated systems often combine weaning with additional stressors such as transportation and marketing, prior to entry into feedlots [32] management practices aiming at reducing stress at weaning include the use of anti-suckling devices (nose-clips) for a period prior to weaning [34,49,50], fence-line contact between calf and dam post-weaning [33,49,51,52] and a combination of both practices before complete separation [53] the benefit of two-stage weaning with nose-clips and fence-line weaning on calf welfare has been questioned in local anaesthesia, systemic analgesia using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, xylazine sedation are available that are highly beneficial in alleviating acute pain caused by castration, dehorning or disbudding. calf pneumonia Aetiology and epidemiology Pneumonia in pre-weaned calves is a multi-factorial disease. the population wide-characteristics of weaned cattle of high respiratory disease risk include animals being of light weight, cattle from multiple origins and previous history of disease. respiratory disease is responsible for nearly a quarter of pre-weaned calf deaths and nearly half of weaned calf deaths in dairy replacement heifers [73]. the value of diagnostic tests in calf pneumonia is somewhat limited due to the multifactorial nature of the disease and the uncertainty if the pathogens recovered from samples are causative to the disease. nasopharyngeal swabs, positive for M. haemolytica and M. bovis, have been demonstrated to be representative of isolates present in the lungs [80] treatment Antibiotic treatment of bacterial pneumonia must be sufficient in duration and early enough to prevent lesions forming that may resist therapy and regeneration of normal lung parenchyma [28] the effectiveness of metaphylaxis (defined as mass medication of all animals on arrival in the feedlot) in reducing morbidity rates associated with pneumonia in feedlots is variable. clinical signs [89,90] and lung pathology [90-92] improve average daily weight gains [92] in calves with respiratory disease compared to untreated calves or calves only treated with antimicrobials. the cost-efficiency of additional anti-inflammatory therapy in bovine respiratory disease is uncertain [28], but there is little experimental evidence to quantify the benefits. vaccination provides best results when carried out in healthy animals and prior to exposure to defined stressful events, such as weaning, marketing, transportation and associated changes in environment. but in these studies the benefit of vaccination and management procedures cannot be assessed independently [45] SV proved effective in challenge studies in calves without maternal antibodies. protective effect of intranasal vaccination compared to an unvaccinated control group was confirmed in two studies. however, intranasal vaccination of seronegative newborn calves decreases clinical signs in a challenge trial. Vaccines against major bacterial pathogens involved in bovine respiratory disease (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni) can decrease clinical signs in challenge models but are rarely tested in monovalent form in field trials. aubry et al. unable to identify any decrease in treatments for respiratory disease in young dairy calves vaccinated with a modified-live vaccine. no significant difference in either average daily gain, incidence of scours or pneumonia in the first two weeks of life was observed when comparing indoor and outdoor rearing in individual pens. if calves are housed individually in naturally ventilated calf barns, solid dividers on the side of pens, together with a high 'nesting score', lower the risk for respiratory disease [8]. a higher incidence of respiratory disease but a lower incidence of diarrhoea has been identified when calves were reared in indoor groups compared with outdoor groups [26]. a review of group housing of dairy calves with different feeding systems concluded that group housing increases the risk of infection, especially in larger groups. ventilation is impaired with an increasing number of solid panels surrounding the calf. ventilation is often compromised by closing of air inlets in an attempt to prevent cold stress for the calves. hutches have been associated with lower morbidity and mortality in dairy calves. daily gain, incidence of scours or pneumonia in the first two weeks of life was observed when comparing indoor and outdoor rearing in individual pens. if calves are housed individually in naturally ventilated calf barns, solid dividers on the side of pens lower the risk for respiratory disease. european legislation prohibits solid walls in individual calf pens and encourages group housing for animal welfare reasons. a higher incidence of respiratory disease but a lower incidence of diarrhoea has been identified when calves were reared in indoor groups compared with outdoor groups [26]. a review of group housing of dairy calves concluded that group housing increases the risk of infection, especially in larger groups. problems can arise in naturally ventilated calf barns in cold and damp wintry conditions. ventilation is often compromised by closing of air inlets to prevent cold stress for the calves. risk factors for disease in recently weaned suckler calves Weaning management of the suckler calf. delaying housing of calves post-weaning reduces the magnitude of the stress response. calves supplemented with concentrate had a lesser reduction in some immune cells (i.e. T lymphocytes), started consuming meal faster when housed indoors and spent more time lying down (rather than standing and walking) post-weaning. castration of male cattle is a routine procedure used in some husbandry systems. it elicits physiological stress by increasing plasma cortisol concentrations. physiological stress as measured by cortisol levels and inflammatory reactions are lower in 1.5 month old calves compared to older calves after Burdizzo castration. ing factor to pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves [42-44] and reducing the cumulative effects of multiple stressors around the time of weaning results in a less marked stress response. this strategy, combined with vaccination programmes and feeding concentrates pre-weaning (preconditioning), reduces subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot [45] castration, disbudding and dehorning of horned cattle is a mandatory requirement in many countries to reduce the risk of injuries to humans or other animals. physiological stress as measured by cortisol levels and inflammatory reactions are lower in 1.5 month old calves compared to older calves after Burdizzo castration. bovine coronavirus appears to play an important role in bovine respiratory disease [65] a number of factors are known to modify the risk of pneumonia in cattle. prior to weaning, single-suckled beef calves outdoors are at the lowest risk of pneumonia. early signs of calf pneumonia include elevated respiratory rate, fever, serous nasal discharge and at the most mild depression or inappetence. early treatment is the most important factor that prevents treatment failure. early recognition is highly dependent on the housing system and handling facilities. nasopharyngeal swabs are positive for M. haemolytica and M. bovis. samples obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage can be used for virology, bacteriology, cytology and parasitology. but presence of bacterial isolates in nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal wash should be interpreted with caution. a recent meta-analysis of north american studies estimated a decrease in mortality and morbidity of 2% and 26%. the average daily weight gain was 0.11 kg higher in these animals in comparison with calves not receiving metaphylactic treatment. the use of antimicrobials for prevention (prophylaxis or metaphylaxis) of calf pneumonia has to be seen in the context of increasing pressure on the veterinary profession to promote prudent use of antibiotics. the disease pattern of pneumonia in calves can vary under a variety of husbandry systems. modified live vaccines, inactivated vaccines, or subunit vaccines are available for most of the major pathogens. the safety and efficacy of modified live and inactivated BRSV vaccines have been demonstrated in experimental challenge trials. reduced clinical disease and lung lesions have been found in most [98-100] but not all [101] trials. monovalent BRSV vaccines have rarely been tested in field trials. conventional BoHV-1 vaccines containing modified live virus are very effective. but they can establish latency and can be reactivated with adverse effects on pregnant cows or young calves in contact with the vaccinated animals. inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, are safe but less efficacious as they only stimulate humoral immunity. bovine coronavirus plays a role in bovine respiratory disease [65] a number of factors are known to modify the risk of pneumonia in cattle. prior to weaning, single-suckled beef calves outdoors are at the lowest risk of pneumonia. keeper diagnosis is only 56% sensitive but 100% specific. early signs of calf pneumonia include elevated respiratory rate, fever, serous nasal discharge and at the most mild depression or inappetence. early signs of calf pneumonia include elevated respiratory rate, fever, serous nasal discharge and at the most mild depression. nasopharyngeal swabs should only be used to identify upper respiratory tract viruses. samples obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used for virology, bacteriology, cytology and parasitology. but presence of bacterial isolates in nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal and/or bronchoalveolar lavage should be cautioned. the emphasis should be on early treatment and first treatment success in cases of calf pneumonia. one third to two thirds of animals that fail to respond successfully are permanently affected or lost. the effectiveness of metaphylaxis in reducing morbidity rates associated with pneumonia in feedlots is variable. vaccine efficacy is complicated by the nature of bovine respiratory disease. the disease pattern of pneumonia in calves can vary under a variety of husbandry systems, as a consequence of different challenges at different points in the rearing period. a review of field trials to assess the efficacy of mono- or multivalent vaccination against bovine respiratory disease without preconditioning. authors identified 9 studies with positive and 13 studies with neutral or negative outcomes. the safety and efficacy of modified live and inactivated BRSV vaccines have been demonstrated in experimental challenge trials. infection can cause clinical pictures from severe classical Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) to no clinical signs at all. it is important to consider the immunosuppressive effect of BoHV1 infection as well as BoHV1 reactivation. inactivated vaccines are safe but less efficacious as they only stimulate humoral immunity. a range of events are linked with increased disease risk in calves. the management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology and of relevant risk factors and effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment.
