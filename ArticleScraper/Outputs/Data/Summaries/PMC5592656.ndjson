{"summary": "cell junction proteins, gap junctions (GJs) form intercellular channels between two neighboring cells only after successful delivery and docking to the cell membrane. one of the most studied Cxs, Cx43, is expressed in multiple organs, including the CNS, heart, and lungs. a neurotropic demyelinating strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 causes retention of Cx43 in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex (ER and/or ERGIC) the expression of Cx43 is also reduced in protein and RNA level in cultured astrocytes. Vaccinia virus is reported to use both MT networks and actin filament for egression. adenovirus entry to host cells is dependent on MTs (24), and the virus also uses MT-associated molecular motors for retrograde transport. MHV-A59 causes hepatitis and meningoencephalitis in the acute phase of infection. alterations of Cx47 during MHV-A59 infection could be associated with loss of myelin protein. this study was extended to understand whether the alteration of Cx43 was also associated with altered oligodendrocytic GJ and myelin protein expression. untreated cells showed the presence of Cx43 at the basal stack (Fig. 1A, thin arrow) and peripheral part of the medial stacks of cells (Fig. 1E, thick arrow) the presence of Cx43 was diminished, whereas the medial stacks showed the continued presence of Cx43 mostly inside the cells (Fig. 1, F\u2013H, thick arrow) cells were subjected to double-label immunofluorescence with rabbit anti-Cx43 antiserum (red) and mouse anti--tubulin antiserum (green) untreated cells showed the presence of Cx43 at both the basal (A, thin arrow) and medial parts of cells (B\u2013D) cells were cytofixed and subjected to double-label immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-tubulin (green in Fig. 2, A, E, and I) and polyclonal anti-Cx43 (red in Fig. 2, B, F, and J) antibodies. mock- and virus-infected cells showed normal MT morphology (Fig. 2, A and E), while 100 m colchicine treatment disrupted the MT network (Fig. 2I five different images from n = 3 biological replicates were quantified for each experimental group. a staining intensity profile was drawn in digitally magnified images. a staining intensity profile was drawn in digitally magnified images. intracellular compartment\u2013retained Cx43 retained in intracellular compartment. intensity and number of colocalization spots were reduced (H) colchicine treatment showed retention of Cx43 in the intracellular compartment. mock-infected and virus-infected cells were similarly stained with monoclonal anti-viral N (green in Fig. 3, A and D) and polyclonal anti-tubulin (red in Fig. 3, B and E) antibodies. similar tubulin morphology was observed for both. cell periphery, viral N signal was present on MT threads (F, arrow) no viral N signal was seen in mock-infected cells (C) no viral N signal was seen in mock-infected cells. h p.i. and 24 h p.i. each compared with mock by Mann\u2013Whitney U test. five different fields were obtained from each experimental group in n = 3 experiments. the difference was significant in a five-group comparison (***, p 0.001). five to six fields were analyzed for each group from n = 3 experiments (K) the difference was significant in a five-group comparison. MHV-A59\u2013infected astrocytes showed an absence of MT-associated Cx43 signal near the cell surface. insets showed that Cx43 molecules were restricted from reaching the cell surface.

Cx43 molecules showed high-intensity peaks on MT threads in mock-infected cells. primary astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 2 or treated with 100 m colchicine for 24 h. control cells were maintained in parallel. 62.8% reduction in virus-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells. 80.3% reduction in colchicine-treated cells compared with mock-infected cells. differences were significant (****, p 0.0001; M) primary astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 2, and mock-infected cells were maintained in parallel. no viral N signal was observed in mock-infected cells (A) the amount of viral N staining increased from 6 to 24 h p.i. discrete viral particles were observed to be present on MT threads. at 18 and 24 h p.i., the anti-N signal was more dispersed throughout the whole cell. at 18 and 24 h p.i., the anti-N signal was more dispersed throughout the whole cell. the amount of anti-N staining increased from 6 to 24 h p.i. at 18 and 24 h p.i., discrete viral particles were observed on MT threads. at 18 and 24 h p.i., anti-N signal was more dispersed throughout the whole cell. cells plated on glass coverslips were mock-infected and subjected to double-label immunofluorescence for Cx43 (green in Fig. 5, A and F) and -tubulin (red in Fig. 5, B and G), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) whole-cell MT network was captured by epifluorescence microscopy. primary astrocytes were mock-infected or infected with MHV-A59. the whole-cell MT network was imaged by epifluorescence microscopy. in control astrocytes, Cx43 (A) was closely associated with positive ends of MTs. astrocyte cultures showed the presence of viral N staining (O and Q) in a single infected cell, where viral N staining colocalized with MTs (Q) the inset shows that the viral particles were aligned along the MT thread at the cell surface (R) the loss of Cx43\u2013-tubulin colocalization was predicted to be due to association between viral particles and the MT network. parallel epifluorescence images were captured for the same field. Cx43 was observed to be present in profuse amounts as its characteristic punctate stain. MHV-A59\u2013infected astrocytes showed mainly perinuclear localization of Cx43. MT morphology is shown for mock-infected (B) or MHV-A59\u2013infected cells (E) distance of Cx43 molecules from the nucleus was measured with the help of ImageJ (G) for mock-infected cells, Cx43 was present 25.9 m away, which was reduced to 12.7 m in MHV-A59\u2013infected cells. densitometric analysis showed that Cx43, bound to -tubulin, was reduced 44.25% in MHV-A59\u2013infected cells. primary astrocytes were either mock-infected or infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 2. -tubulin was expressed in equal amount in mock\u2013 and MHV-A59\u2013infected cells. -tubulin, associated with Cx43, was depleted 55.61% upon virus infection. polyclonal anti--tubulin antibody was used to immunoprecipitate -tubulin and associated proteins. samples were denatured and probed for viral N by Western blotting. anti-N signal was observed upon co-IP of -tubulin in infected astrocytes. cells were immunolabeled with -tubulin (green in Fig. 9, A\u2013D), Cx43 (red in Fig. 9, A\u2013D) and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) dose-dependent treatment of ciliobrevin induced localization of Cx43 aggregates around the nucleus, suggesting that dynein might have played a crucial role in altered MT-mediated Cx43 trafficking. oligodendrocytic Cx47 is reported to form heterotypic GJ plaques with oligodendrocytic partner Cx47 and also phosphorylates and stabilizes Cx47 in vivo. total protein was extracted from mouse brain, and Cx47 expression (detectable at nearly 47 kDa) was compared by Western blotting. oligodendrocytic Cx47 was reduced in brain in the acute stage of inflammation, at day 5 p.i. (acute phase) and at day 30 p.i. (chronic phase) whole-brain proteins were probed for Cx47 (detected at nearly 47 kDa) and internal control, -actin (detected at nearly 42 kDa) at day 5 p.i., MHV-A59 infection was observed in the mouse brain. MHV-A59\u2013infected brain showed no viral N signal. characteristic Cx47 signal was disrupted in MHV-A59\u2013infected brain. 7.567 Cx47 perikaryonic plaques were reduced in an area of 135 135 m2. at day 30 p.i., this depletion was 6.9 intact Cx47 plaques in an area of 135 135 m2. no virus-specific staining was observed for mock-infected brains. ining was disrupted (H, thick arrow) at peak of demyelination at day 30 p.i., there was no infectious viral particle observed in brain (I and K) normal Cx47-specific signal, visible in oligodendrocytic perikarya, remained depleted at day 30 p.i. in mock-infected brains, perikaryonic Cx47 signal was arranged in beads-on-a-string fashion around myelinated fibers in corpus callosum (Fig. 12A), anterior commissure (Fig. 12I), and deep cerebellar white matter (Fig. 12Q). prominent PLP expression was observed in these regions of the mock-infected brain (Fig. 12, B, J, and R), where myelinated axon fibers were associated MHV-A59\u2013infected mice showed disrupted Cx47 staining. puncta were reduced in and around other myelinated regions. oligodendrocytic perikarya showed characteristic stain. MHV-A59 infection altered Cx43 trafficking to the cell surface in a MT-dependent manner. oligodendrocytic GJ coupling partner of Cx43, Cx47, was down-regulated in MHV-A59 infection. this depletion was associated with loss of the myelin marker PLP at the chronic stage of viral infection. in control primary astrocytes, it was observed that Cx43 was aligned along the MTs. Upon infection, this alignment was perturbed and colocalization of Cx43--tubulin was significantly reduced. at the same time, viral particles were observed to be colocalized with the MT network, specifically at the cell periphery. a rotavirus membrane glycoprotein, NSP-4, binds to MTs and arrests normal ER-to-Golgi trafficking (38). a rotavirus membrane glycoprotein, NSP-4, binds to MTs and arrests normal ER-to-Golgi trafficking (38). there are limited data available on specific cellular proteins that might be disrupted due to MT-mediated viral trafficking. cytoplasmic dynein is reported to mediate interaction between viral capsid and MTs (25). this is supported by the current studies, where the inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein by ciliobrevin D resulted in impaired delivery of Cx43 to the cell surface. astrocytic Cx43 forms GJs between astrocytes by Cx43\u2013Cx43 channels, but also with oligodendrocytes by Cx43\u2013Cx47 channels. disruption of Cx43\u2013Cx47\u2013mediated GJIC is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which demyelinating plaques expand (47). the loss of Cx47 staining in white matter was associated with loss of the myelin marker PLP at the chronic phase of MHV-A59 infection. the loss of functional Cx47 is also reported to be associated with microglial activation (34) experimental procedures Preparation of mixed glial cultures were established from newborn mice (day 0 to 1) using a protocol described previously (52) following removal of meninges, brain tissues were homogenized and incubated in a rocking water bath set at 37 \u00b0C. weakly adherent microglia cells came off into suspension. remaining adherent monolayers of cells were used as enriched astrocyte cultures. infected cultures were subjected to different studies at specified time points p.i. images were acquired and processed with Zen 2012 software (Carl Zeiss) or using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM710). primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence, co-IP, and Western blotting Secondary antibodies were as described in the text. cells were olabeled for either Cx43 and -tubulin or -tubulin and N protein. images were taken with a 100, 1.51 numeric aperture TIRF objective. cells were imaged with an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope. the primary antibody-bound MagnaBind IgG particles were isolated using a magnetic separator. the beads were washed three times, and finally the bound material was eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. the sources and dilutions of primary antibodies are listed in Table 1. samples were centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed at 4 \u00b0C. supernatants were taken, and total protein content was estimated with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. tissue processing and double-label immunofluorescence of frozen sections Mock\u2013 and MHV-A59\u2013infected mice were perfused transcardially with PBS. sections were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antisera diluted in blocking serum, washed, and subsequently incubated with secondary antiserum diluted in goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. the images were processed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM710), as specified. cells were plated and allowed to adhere for 1 day in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. after 24 h, all non-adherent cells were removed, and fresh astrocyte-specific medium was added. a medium change every 3\u20134 days to allow differential adhesion of astrocytes and microglia. infected cells were maintained in astrocyte-specific medium containing 10% normal serum. infected cultures were subjected to different studies at specified time points p.i.
