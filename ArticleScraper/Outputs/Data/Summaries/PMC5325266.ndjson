{"summary": "vitamin A, 25(OH)D, and E, and antimicrobial peptide LL-37 may have immunomodulatory effects. serum levels were associated with allergy status, intratonsillar/nasopharyngeal virus detection and intratonsillar expression of immune response-specific cytokines. vitamin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of asthma [5\u20137], but randomized trials with vitamin A supplementation were less supportive [8, 9]. vitamin D is known to induce antimicrobial peptide LL-37. the ethics committee of Turku University Hospital approved the study. all patients filled a standard questionnaire to obtain information of their allergic diseases and respiratory symptoms. eczema was defined as atopic eczema, if a child was atopic and had typical symptoms that included pruritus. d atopic eczema 14/102 (14%) Physician-diagnosed asthma 12/99 (12%) Active smoking 19/98 (19%) Respiratory symptoms on the operation day2 16/95 (17%) Last day of respiratory symptoms, days ago3 20 (7, 31) Respiratory symptoms within 2 week 37/96 (39%) Respiratory symptoms within 4 weeks 50/96 (52%) Values are shown as medians (interquartile range) or n (%). bioavailable levels of 25(OH)D were estimated using additional serum measurements (D-binding protein and albumin) and published formulae [22]. serum specific IgE levels against common airborne and food allergens were determined by using a fluoroenzyme immunoassay. intratonsillar mRNA expression levels of the cytokines and transcription factors related to T subsets cells relevant to allergic responses. gene expressions of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet were analyzed by quantitative real-time as previously described. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were described as means (sd) or medians (interquartile ranges) when appropriate, and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. subjects with and without serum samples were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-square test. animal sensitization was defined as positive IgE antibodies to cat, dog, horse or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. eczema was defined as atopic eczema, if a child was atopic and had typical symptoms that included pruritus. 2Four had throat symptoms, two had rhinitis and two had cough. one had symptoms of upper airway obstruction and 5 had combinations of these. nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained during the operation. naive nasopharyngeal aspirates and intratonsillar samples were performed according to clinical routine using PCRs for adenovirus, bocavirus-1, coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1). intratonsillar samples (approximately 300 g each) were homogenized and the total RNA was isolated from tonsil tissues as previously described. IL-37, TGF-, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet were analyzed by quantitative real-time. data are shown as relative expressions, which represents the 2-(CT) values multiplied by 104, where CT corresponds to the difference between the CT value for the gene of interest and EF1. correlations were calculated using Spearman rank-order correlations coefficients. modifying effects of age (16 vs. 16 years) and indication of tonsillectomy (recurrent tonsillitis vs. hypertrophic tonsils) were also examined. seventeen % of patients had respiratory symptoms on the operation day (Table 1). Serum levels of vitamins and LL-37 The median level for serum vitamin A was 1.4 mol/l (range 0.4\u20133.3), for vitamin E 18 mol/l (range 3\u201331), for total 25(OH)D 50 nmol/l (range 15\u2013135), for bioavailable 25(OH)D 2.0 nmol/l (range 0.6\u20137.8) and for LL-37 34 ng overall virus prevalence was 100% in children under 5 years. but only 13% after 40 years of age. higher vitamin A tended to associate with less nasopharyngeal virus detection. serum (A) bioavailable 25(OH)D levels according to atopy (p = 0.0031) mean, standard error of means and adjusted P values are shown. higher bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were associated with higher expression levels of newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 (P = 0.024) and higher vitamin A levels were associated with higher expression of IFN- (P = 0.043) the subjects without serum samples did not differ from the analytic cohort in regard to age, sex, allergy or nasopharyngeal/intratonsillar virus detection (all P > 0.1) the median age of the study subjects was 16 years (range 3\u201360) and 45% were males. 57% of patients had at least one virus and 23% had 2 or more viruses. bocavirus (47%) was the most prevalent virus, followed by bocavirus (14%), adenovirus (9%), enteroviruses (8%), coronavirus (3% each) in tonsils, 25% of patients had at least one virus and 6% had 2 or more viruses. asopharyngeal virus detection (P = 0.056) lower bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were associated with allergic rhinitis (P = 0.046) and lower vitamin E levels with self-reported allergy (P = 0.0086) no other significant associations were found. age or indication for tonsillectomy did not affect these clinical associations. no other significant associations were found between serum levels of vitamins and LL-37 and the \u201cimmune activation/regulatory\u201d cluster of cytokines. age, smoking or indication for tonsillectomy did not have modifying effects on mRNA expression associations. vitamin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of asthma and wheezing. vitamin A has been shown to enhance Treg activity via FOXP3 and inhibit Th17 development via retinoid orphan receptor t (RORt) LL-37 is an endogenous antibiotic peptide that destroy bacteria, viruses and fungi. higher serum LL-37 levels were associated with lower intratonsillar expression of IL-17 and its transcription factor RORC2, both needed to Th17 cell development [41], as well as lower expression of FOXP3. our study suggests vitamin D may promote anti-inflammatory mechanisms. further studies are needed to understand crosstalk between regulatory networks in allergy and viral infections."}
