{"summary": "hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing. results This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the united states. number and proportion of reads mapped to IFV or MERS-CoV at IFV spiked-in genome equivalents of 0, 750, 1,500 and 3,000. a constant, high level of MERS-CoV genomic material given preparation by hybridization-based target enrichment or shotgun sequencing."}
