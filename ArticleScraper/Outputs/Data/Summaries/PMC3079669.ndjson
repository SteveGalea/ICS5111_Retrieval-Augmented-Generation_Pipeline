{"summary": "analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. but little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date. synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. the codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure. recent studies of viral codon usage have shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection. the Sabin oral poliovaccine (OPV) was among the best known viral vaccines [18]. it has saved the lives and health of innumerable people, in particular children. however, poliovirus is highly genetically variable. so far, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of poliovirus genome has been acquired to date. 630 Haiti DVPV AF405662 5 HAI01007 1 6630 Haiti DVPV AF405666 6 HAI01007 1 6630 Haiti DVPV AF405668 8 HAI00003 1 6630 Haiti DVPV AF405669 9 DOR01012 1 6630 Dominica DVPV AF405670 10 DOR00041C3 1 6630 Dominica DVPV AF405679 11 DOR00028 1 6630 Dominica 10094c 1 6630 China DVPV FJ859062 30 10095c 1 6630 China DVPV FJ859063 31 10097c 1 6630 China DVPV FJ859064 32 EGY88-074 2 6624 Egypt DVPV AF448782 33 EGY93-034 2 6624 Egypt DVPV AF448782 33 EGY93-034 2 6624 Egypt DVPV AF448782 33 EGY9 the values of the effective number of codon range from 20 to 61. in an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; if all codons are used equally, it would be 61; and if the value of ENC is greater than 40, the codon usage bias was regarded as low. odds ratio xy=xy/yx, where x denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X, yx the expected frequency of the dinucleotide XY and xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, etc., for each dinucleotide were calculated. for xy > 1.23 (or 0.78), the XY pair is considered to be of over-represented (or under-represented) relative abundance all of the sequences were downloaded from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/, and 48 poliovirus genomes were selected. the other sequences with >98% sequence identities were excluded. 61 1 6630 C Taiwanc DVPV AF538843 19 Sabin 1 1 6630 USA Vaccined AY184219 20 Brunhilde 1 6630 China W Virusb AY560657 21 USA10784 1 6630 USA DVPV EF682356 22 USA10785 1 6630 USA DVPV EF682357 23 USA10783 1 6630 USA DVPV EF682358 24 USA10786 1 6630 USA DVPV EF68 189+AP1 2 6624 Belarus DVPV FJ460224 43 31996 2 6624 Belarus DVPV FJ460225 44 PV2/Rus 2 6624 Russia DVPV FJ517649 45 Sabin 3 3 6621 USA Vaccined AY184221 46 33239 3 6621 Belarus DVPV FJ460226 47 31974 3 6621 Belarus DVPV FJ460227 48 FIN84-60212 3 6621 ij is the observed number of the ith codon for jth amino acid. the codon with RSCU value more than 1.0 has positive codon usage bias. the value 1.0 has relative negative codon usage bias. polioviruses genome is A redundant with A content ranging from 29.739 to 30.826.11, with the mean value of 30.367 and S.D. of 0.234. polioviruses genome is A redundant with A content ranging from 29.739 to 30.826.11.
