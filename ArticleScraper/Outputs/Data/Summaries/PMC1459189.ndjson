{"summary": "conventional biosensors are hybrid elements consisting of a biochemical receptor for a given analyte. they are physically coupled to a physicochemical transducer that converts such interaction into a macroscopic, analytically useful signal. new types of protein-only biosensors are being explored [3] that contain both the receptor and transducer elements in a single polypeptide chain. protein engineering allows the modification of the receptor in a way in which the interaction with the analyte promotes profound conformational modifications. insertional protein engineering allows a more versatile combination of functional modules for the construction of highly responsive mosaic proteins exhibiting unusual conformational versatility upon ligand binding [8,9] a ligand promotes conformational modifications in the sensor either multimerization, correct folding or allosteric activation. a few enzyme biosensors are inactivated in presence of the ligand probably by steric hindrance of the active site.
