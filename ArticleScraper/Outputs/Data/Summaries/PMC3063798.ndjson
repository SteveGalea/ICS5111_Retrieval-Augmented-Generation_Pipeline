{"summary": "the dominant viral etiologies responsible for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are poorly understood, particularly among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries where morbidity and mortality caused by ARIs are highest. more research is needed to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections. the most common etiologic agents of ARIs in hospitalized children are viruses. the most commonly implicated viruses among hospitalized children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A and B viruses (InfV A and InfV B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-2-3) and adenoviruses (AdV) patients were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008 from the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit and the Paediatric Respiratory Ward at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. children were eligible for inclusion if less than 15 years of age and if admitted for an ARI or ARI-related condition. included were patients who were discharged from a hospital in the previous 4 days, newborns who never left the hospital. since July 2007, an automated commercial GuSCN-based method was used. for each individual patient, all three respiratory specimens were extracted simultaneously. an internal RNA-virus control (equine arteritis virus (EAV) was added to each sample prior to extraction. described monoplex real-time RT-PCRs were performed for detection of HBoV, enterovirus and hCoV-NL63[14]. a patient was considered to have a single viral infection if only one pathogen was detected in one or more of the tested specimens. a patient was considered a true-positive (TP) for a given virus if any specimen type or testing method yielded a positive result. the specificity of each specimen type for any given virus was by definition 100%. three types of respiratory specimens (nasal swabs, throat swabs, and nasopharyngeal aspirates) were collected on admission by trained personnel using standard operating procedures. RNA was extracted from 100 l of each respiratory specimen using an inhouse GuSCN based extraction protocol. each 20 l reaction mixture contained 5 l extracted RNA, 4 l of 5X RT-buffer, 0.5 mM of each dNTP (Roche), 2 ng random hexamer, 10 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 1 UI of RNAse inhibitor and 2 UI RT Superscript III. cDNA synthesis was performed using an Eppendorf master thermocycler gradient system (Perkin-Elmer Corporation, Foster City, USA a patient was considered a true-positive (TP) for a given virus if any specimen type or testing method yielded a positive result. the specificity of each specimen type for any given virus was by definition 100%. true negatives (TN), defined as the number of patients negative in all three specimens and false negatives (FN), defined as a negative sample. an alternative specimen from the same patient tested positive for a given virus. 79 (26%) of 309 patients were admitted to the study. a history of previous hospitalizations for respiratory illness was observed more frequently in patients admitted to PRW. a history of previous hospitalizations for respiratory illness was observed more frequently in patients admitted to PRW.

Increasing evidence suggests that RSV infections may be related to asthma phenotypes, with progressive disappearance of this effect with increasing age. the differential increase over nasal or throat swabs appears less marked for molecular based methods. however, the differential improvement over nasal or throat swabs was marginal and not statistically significant across all viruses. we focused only on viral aetiologies since these are common causes of ARI and understudied in this region. in total, only 4.1% of all admitted ARI patients at the respiratory ward (40 beds) were enrolled in the study. 14.2% of ARI patients admitted to the PICU (15 beds) the proportion remained stable throughout the study period."}
