{"summary": "ebola virus (EBOV) and marburg virus (MARV) belong to the Family Filoviridae. there are four distinct EBOV species, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) and the proposed new species Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) among replication-transcription protein (VP30), minor matrix protein (VP24) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) EBOV expresses at least one secreted non-structural glycoprotein (sGP) transcribing the glycoprotein gene produces a soluble GP. transcriptional editing accompanied by frame shifting is required to produce full-length, membrane-anchored GP. quadrupeds are naturally susceptible to EBOV infection. infectious MARV was recently isolated from Egyptian fruit bats in Uganda. virus was closely related to those isolated from victims of the 2007 MARV outbreak in Uganda. it is unclear whether these bats maintain EBOV and/or MARV. a mouse model for MARV infection has been established. mutations in the GP gene of these mouse- or guinea pig-adapted viruses were not the primary factor for efficient replication in mice and guinea pigs. GP is highly glycosylated with large amounts of N- and O-linked glycans. GP1 subunit mediates viral attachment, most likely through the MLR or the putative receptor binding region. hydrophobic fusion loop on GP2 is thought to catalyze fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane. pseudotype virus systems for functional analysis of filovirus GPs have been established. the systems rely on recombinant viruses that contain filovirus GP instead of their own GPs. such systems enable us to investigate cell tropism mediated by simple interaction between filovirus GP and its cellular ligands. a recombinant VSV that contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene can be generated. this virus is not infectious unless the envelope protein responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion is provided in trans. cellular Molecules Identified as ubiquitous receptors for filovirus entry. reduction of Axl expression by RNAi treatment resulted in decreased ZEBOV entry via. macropinocytosis but had no effect on the clathrin-dependent or caveola/lipid raft-mediated endocytic mechanisms. direct interactions between these cellular molecules and the GP RBR remain to be demonstrated. more recent studies suggest that endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann\u2013Pick C1 is essential for filovirus infection. cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin removes heavily glycosylated regions to expose the putative RBR. it remains elusive whether these molecules act as functional receptors that mediate both viral attachment and membrane fusion. pseudotyped viruses bearing MLR-deletion mutant GP have often been used for approaches to identify filovirus-specific receptors. but the MLR plays an important role in filovirus entry into preferred target cells such as endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and antigen-presenting cells. human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (hMGL), liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) all have been reported to promote filovirus entry. interaction between GP MLR and C-type lectins is not essential for viral entry. primary macrophage and dendritic cell cultures transduced for C-type lectin expression greatly increased their susceptibility to virus infection. soluble mannose-binding C-type lectin played a role in protection from lethal Ebola virus infection in a mouse model. some viruses utilize antiviral antibodies for their entry into target cells. this mechanism is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection. ADE is expressed exclusively on the cells of the immune system. ADE activities of the anti-sera to GP are virus-species-specific. potential viral pathogenicity is correlated with the ability to induce ADE antibodies. the demonstration of ADE of filovirus infection raises fundamental questions about the development of GP-based vaccines. all enveloped viruses initiate infection by attaching to host cells. this interaction is often a key determinant controlling viral tissue tropism. however, it remains elusive whether these molecules serve as functional receptors."}
