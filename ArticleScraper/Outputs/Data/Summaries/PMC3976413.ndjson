{"summary": "geographic access to high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers varies widely across states and regions in the united states. an estimated 332,100 cases of severe respiratory from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur in the united states each year. there are no established hospital criteria for high capability centers for severe acute respiratory failure. candidates include high mechanical ventilation hospital volumes or the ability to perform extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) a volume-outcome relationship exists for mechanically ventilated medical patients, with higher annual hospital volumes associated with improved patient outcomes. we incorporated interhospital transfers into our geographic access calculations. we determined geographic access to high capability centers using national census, air medical transport and street network databases. we used a one-hour driving radius to liberally estimate the hospital catchment population. ELSO maintains an on-line list of active adult ECMO centers. we excluded adult cases reported from children's hospitals. we used the 2010 MedPAR file to identify hospitals reporting ECMO in administrative claims. population geographic Access We compared state-level, regional and national geographic access using each high capability center criteria. we then identified all adult short term acute care hospitals within a one- and two-hour driving radii of high capability centers. we created maps of ground and rotary air coverage using ArcGIS version 10.1 software (ESRI, Redlands, CA) we created two types of geographic access maps: continuous Albers equal area projections and isodemographic cartograms using the Gastner-Newman method of spatial transformation. we identified ECMO using the ICD-9-CM procedure code 39.65 [28] to identify high capability centers using high mechanical ventilation criteria. we also used the 2010 MedPAR file, identifying adult, non-surgical patients receiving mechanical ventilation. the 315 threshold in Medicare estimates an all-payer hospital volume of approximately 600 mechanical ventilation cases per year. ten to fifty thousand persons; or rural), teaching status according to each hospital's resident to bed ratio (non-teaching: 0; small teaching: >0 to 0.2; large teaching: >0.2) and ownership status (nonprofit, for profit or government) ground transport analysis We identified all adult short term acute care hospitals within a one- and two-hour driving radii of high capability centers. of 4,822 acute care hospitals, there were 498 (10.3%) high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers in the united states. a minority of hospitals met our criteria for both ECMO and high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. high capability centers were located predominantly in urban areas. b hospitals reporting more than 315 annual claims for medical mechanical ventilation, c interquartile range, d intensive care unit, e thousand. direct high capability center geographic access ranged from 47.9% in the South for ECMO to 92.2% in the Northeast for high volume mechanical ventilation. 99.8 95.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 99.9 Kentucky 43.9 99.9 100 69.8 9 99.9 North Carolina 41.1 99.7 99.8 84.0 99.8 99.8 99.8 Oklahoma 34.2 92.3 100 61.8 99.2 100 South Carolina 38.6 99.9 99.9 81.9 99.9 99.9 Tennessee 49.9 83.7 100 80.6 100 100 Texas 63.0 82.4 99.0 77.4 96.9 99.6 Virginia 52.8 99.8 99.9 86.5 99.9 99.9 West, % 59.4 dark orange areas show regions with direct high capability severe respiratory failure center geographic access. medium orange areas show regions with geographic access after a one-hour ground or air interhospital transfer. ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; MV: high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. nine states had no direct geographic access to high capability centers. three states by high mechanical ventilation criteria. 89.5 100 100 South Dakota 0 7.1 68.9 28.2 60.2 75 Wisconsin 56.2 97.7 99.7 52.6 95.2 99.7 South, % 47.9 85.0 99.6 78.6 99.2 99.8 Alabama 23.7 79.5 99.9 71.6 100 100 Arkansas 0.4 20.8 99.6 39.4 99.6 99.6 99.6 99.6 99.6 99.6 99.6 98.6 39.4 99.6 hospitals reporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cases to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure codes reported in Medicare discharge claims. b hospitals reporting more than 315 annual claims for medical mechanical ventilation. piratory Failure Center Geographic Access through interhospital transport A total of 274 high capability centers reported helipads to ADAMS. nationally, 87.5 and 96.5% of the adult population had geographic access to a high capability center with one-hour interhospital transport. high capability center geographic access varied by state and region. the final domain, acceptability, includes both the hospital perspective and patient choice. a patient-centered approach optimally incorporates patient and family preferences. the success of regionalized care will certainly depend on finding a balance between system capability and patient preferences. in the united states there are 925 primary stroke centers. as of 2008 there were 298 hospitals performing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. geographic access to hospitals meeting the ECMO criteria ranged form 58.5 to 96.4%. ELSO criterion only identified adult hospitals performing veno-venous ECMO. some may perform adult ECMO cannulation in nearby adult hospital centers. despite these limitations, our findings have practical significance. referral center access in the case of disasters and pandemics depend highly on local and regional care coordination across political boundaries."}
