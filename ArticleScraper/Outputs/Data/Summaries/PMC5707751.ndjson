{"summary": "dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the infection of dengue virus (DENV) it has been estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur annually, of which 96 million manifest clinically 1. Before 1970, only nine countries experienced dengue epidemics. there are four dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1-4, which are genetically and antigenically distinct. each serotype elicits a similar range of disease manifestations during infection 3. CYD-TDV is a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine based on the yellow fever 17D virus backbone 14, 15. the approved regimen involves three doses, given at the 0th, 6th and 12th months, for individuals between 9-45 years of age. results from phase III clinical trials showed that the vaccine successfully reduced dengue hospitalizations by 80%. nucleoside analogs, such as NITD-008 and balapiravir, entered preclinical animal safety study and clinical trials. they were terminated due to lack of potency 21. treatment of deNV-infected mice with another nucleoside analog NITD-008 completely prevented mice death, but severe adverse events were observed in rats and dogs. the dengue virion is a spherical particle, approximately 50 nm in diameter with envelope (E) and precursor-membrane (prM) / membrane (M) proteins located on its surface. the capsid (C) proteins sit underneath the lipid bilayer, encapsulating the viral genome 29. to design peptides with therapeutic potential against dengue virus, it is necessary to understand the viral replication cycle. recognition is believed to be mediated by the domain III of E protein to enable the virus to enter into host cells by receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis (primary method) 35, 36. however, studies have also shown that viral entry could occur by the direct fusion of the virus and host cells 37-39. prM and the \"pr\" will act as chaperones to stabilize the E protein during the secretory pathway by preventing premature membrane fusion. at the end, the \u201cpr\u201d peptide will dissociate upon the release of the progeny by exocytosis 45. the antiviral peptides are classified according to their mechanism of action. synthetic peptide synthesis, mass spectrometry and silico drug design have allowed high-throughput drug screening. advances in peptide manipulations such as synthesis of D-amino acids, cyclic peptides, incorporation of chemicals and nanocarriers have further increased the bioavailability of peptides 53. peptides include glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and analogues 57, deletion peptides of insulin 56 and a deletion peptide of the heat shock protein 60 54. the number of new entities approved by the FDA rapidly decreases over the years 64 and the number of publicities about the side effects of popular small molecules increases 65-67. a small molecule, CCR5 inhibitor, Maraviroc, successfully inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by binding to the CCR5 co-receptor of host cells 68, 69. myrcludex B, a lipomyristolated peptide containing 47 homologous amino acid residues of hepatitis B virus pre-S1 protein, was able to bind to the NTCP of host cells. no peptide inhibitors were found to block DENV infection by binding to cellular attachment factors or receptors. this represents a big research gap that should prompt researchers to investigate. the DC-SIGN is a type II transmembrane protein that falls into the category of C-type lectin. hippeastrum hybrid (HHA), Galanthus nivalis (GNA) and Urtica dioica (UDA) were able to bind to the envelope of DENV. pradimicin-s (PRM-S), a small-size non-peptidic CBA, exert antiviral activity against DENV by binding to the DENV envelope in monocyte-derived dendritic cells 91. enan and dl-galactan hybrid C2S-3 (sulphated polysaccharides isolated from the red seaweeds Gymnogongrus griffithsiae and Cryptonemia crenulata) inhibited DENV infection in a virus serotype and host cell dependent manner 97. no antiviral peptide was identified to either bind to cellular receptor or act as a receptor mimetic to block DENV entry thus far DENV possesses the capability to utilize a wide range of cellular receptors and pathways to enter host cells. viral structural proteins, especially the E protein, is a popular target for antiviral inhibitors to interfere with the virus-host interactions and stop subsequent viral entry. the deNV E structural proteins have been well determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy 112, 117, 118. recent advances in the understanding of the high-resolution E structure have allowed researchers to utilize the information in combination with in silico molecular drug designing methods to search for potential antiviral candidates. list of antiviral peptides against DENV structural proteins Peptides DENV serotypes Sequences Inhibitory activities Target References DN59 All serotypes MAILGDTAWDFGSLGGVFTSIGKALHQVFGAIY IC50 less than 10M for all serotypes.

(2005). interfacial helical hydrophobic moment (iHHM) quantified the segregation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of a peptide folded into an -helix structure 128. higher iHHM value indicates stronger membrane interaction with peptides 129, 130. a di-peptide, EF, was the most effective antiviral peptide as it inhibited DENV-2 infection with the IC50 value of 96 M 133. studies have shown that the E stem region was well conserved among Flaviviruses [including TBE, YFV and JEV] 121, 136. mutagenesis was performed, confirming that residues 442-444 were important in conferring the antiviral activity of the stem peptide. a similar situation was observed by Hrobowski et al. (2005), whereby the DN 59 peptide which was shown to inhibit DENV had also demonstrated cross-inhibitory activity against WNV 119. peptide inhibitors 1OAN1 and DN59 were able to inhibit the ADE effect in vitro with an IC50 of 3 M and 6 M respectively 139. peptide gg-ww biopanned a randomised phage display peptide library against the purified DENV-2 viral particles. the cleavage of the prM protein by the cellular protease (furin) would separate the prM protein into the \u201cpr\u201d peptide (1-91 residues), the ectodomain (92-130 residues) and the M protein (131-166 residues) 45, 142, 143. a previous study has shown that prM-containing-virus is more resistant to the low pH environment 144. the deNV C protein (approximately 11 kDa) is composed of four -helical regions arranged in antiparallel homodimers 147. the structure of the C protein contains high net charge with an asymmetric distribution of basic residues which lie along the surface of the C protein to orchestrate RNA binding. the opposite surface forms a hydrophobic region which may enable interactions with lipids 147, 148. HIV-1 protease inhibition was shown to be a successful strategy in treating HIV infection 151. the virus particles would not be able to transform into the mature virion, hence obstructing the viral replication. tripeptide aldehyde inhibitors were reported to have the most potential as anti-DENV candidates. tripeptide 1 (benzoyl-n-Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg-H) and tripeptide 2 (phenylacetyl-Lys-Arg-Arg-H) were reported to have the most potential as anti-DENV candidates with IC50 of 9.5 M and 6.7 M, respectively 162. a peptide, CP7, was able to show good inhibitory property against the protease. similar with the binding of aprotinin to the protease, strong hydrogen bonds contributed by the P1 and P2' positions were observed but the inhibitory constant value was not as strong as aprotinin (Ki of 0.026 M) this might be due to the flexibility of the cyclic peptide which resulted in the decreased affinity against the protea the arylcyanoacrylamide moiety mimic the first Arg in the P1 position while the Arg-Lys-Nle tripeptide bound to other protein pockets of NS2B-NS3 protease. however, the drug candidate did not have significant antiviral activity in the cell culture against DENV. tripeptide hybrid 83 was created by the combination of 4-CF3-benzyl ether and the thiazole cap. tripeptide hybrid 86 was created by the combination of 4-CF3-benzyl ether and the thien-2-yl cap. both of the peptide hybrids successfully showed improved Ki values. peptide inhibitor 11 (Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Bip) possessed the best pharmacokinetic properties among all inhibitors due to its ability to be better absorbed into the intestine and to remain inactive in the central nervous system 170. the best hexapeptide inhibitor was derived from the NS2A/NS2B region with a Ki value of 12 M. CKRKC was found to be the best candidate with the estimated free binding energy of -8.39 kcal/mol and Ki of 0.707 M 173. the cyclopentapeptide was designed in silico, further in vitro and cell-based experiments were required to further exploit the inhibitory potential of the peptide against DENV. protegrin-1 and retrocyclin-1 were identified against DENV NS2B-NS3 protease 176, 177. it was previously shown that protegrin-1 possessed broad antimicrobial properties against different microorganisms 178. retrocyclin-1 was shown to inhibit the NS2B-NS3 protease at an IC50 of 11.7 M 176. apiravir are examples of nucleoside inhibitors. NITD-008 corresponds to an adenosine analogue while balapiravir failed due to its low efficiency in clinical trials 21, 22. tyr123-Prepro Endothelin (110-130) and urotensin II 181 were shown to bind to the NS5 methyltranserase. unmodified peptides were shown to commonly degrade quickly in human serum, resulting in low in vivo activities 183, 184. however, various chemical modifications can be applied to manipulate the physicochemical properties of peptides, thereby increasing the stability and bioavailability of the peptides. peptides can be incorporated into the peptide sequence to act as a cargo delivery in carrying antiviral peptide across the permeability barrier and entering cells to exert its inhibitory activity 191. peptides can also be incorporated into the peptide sequence to act as a cargo delivery in carrying antiviral peptide across the permeability barrier. studies have shown that a small molecule, CCR5 inhibitor, Maraviroc, successfully inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by binding to the CCR5 co-receptor of host cells 68, 69. myrcludex B, a lipomyristolated peptide containing 47 homologous amino acid residues of hepatitis B virus pre-S1 protein, was able to bind to the NTCP of the DC-SIGN is a type II transmembrane protein that falls into the category of C-type lectin with an extracellular domain that can bind specifically to carbohydrates 82. this is an essential cellular factor required for the infection of ebola virus 83, 84, HIV-1 85, 86 and human cytomegalovirus 87 into dendritic cells. nivalis (GNA) and Urtica dioica (UDA) were able to bind to the DENV envelope. pradimicin-s (PRM-S), a small-size non-peptidic CBA, exert antiviral activity against DENV by binding to the DENV envelope in monocyte-derived dendritic cells 91. many other heparin mimetics, including CF-238 81, sulphated galactomannan 98, curdlan sulfate 99, sulphated galactan 98, sulphated K5 100 and chondroitin sulfate 101, were found to inhibit DENV infection. no antiviral peptide was identified to either bind to cellular receptor or act as a receptor mimetic to block DENV entry thus far. possesses the capability to utilize a wide range of cellular receptors and pathways to enter host cells. the deNV E protein is 53 kDa in size and composed of three distinct domains, namely the domain I E(I), flanked by the dimerization domain E(II). DENV structural proteins have been well determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy 112, 117, 118. recent advances in the understanding of the high-resolution E structure have allowed researchers to utilize the information in combination with in silico molecular drug designing methods to search for potential antiviral candidates. otypes Sequences Inhibitory activities Target References DN59 All serotypes MAILGDTAWDFGSLGGVFTSIGKALHQVFGAIY IC50 less than 10M for all serotypes Envelope 119,120 P1 DENV-2 DTRACDVIALLCHLNT 200 M (99.3% inhibition) Envelope 137 DV2419-447 All serotypes AWDFGSLGGVFTSIGKALHQVF FP IC IC 90: DV1- 0.1 M; DV2- 2 M DV3- 4 M; DV4- 1.5 M Envelope 136 DV4419-447 All serotypes AWDFGSVGGLFTSLGKAVHQVFGSVYTTM (solubility tag-RGKGR) IC 90: DV1- 5 M; DV2- 6 M DV3- >6 M; DV4- 6 M Envelope 136 DN57opt a set of overlapping peptides were synthesized and tested for their binding affinities with soluble form of DV2 E (sE), covering only the first 395 residues of E. a peptide (DV2419-447) was found to bind selectively to the post-fusion of sE with the concentration of half-maximal change in fluorescence polarization (FP IC50) of 0.125 M and Kd at approximately 150 nM. the importance of hydrophobicity was further supported by Hrobowski et al. (2005). the novel antiviral peptide was successfully identified using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale. iHHM quantified the segregation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of a peptide folded into an -helix structure 128. higher iHHM value indicates stronger membrane interaction with peptides 129, 130. OG hydrophobic pocket was further validated as several compounds targeting this hydrophobic pocket were able to stop DENV infection 134, 135. studies have shown that the E stem region was well conserved among Flaviviruses [including WNV, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE), YFV and JEV] 121, 136. residues 442-444 were important in conferring the antiviral activity of the stem peptide whereby increased hydrophobicity would increase inhibitory strength 136. a similar situation was observed by Hrobowski et al. (2005), whereby the DN 59 peptide which was shown to inhibit DENV had also demonstrated cross-inhibitory activity against WNV 119. peptide inhibitors 1OAN1 and DN59 were able to inhibit the ADE effect in vitro with an IC50 of 3 M and 6 M, respectively 139. peptide gg-ww inhibited DENV-2 entry. ectodomain (92-130 residues) and the M protein (131-166 residues) 45, 142, 143 are responsible for coding the glycosylated \u201cpr\u201d segment of the prM protein. the prM is believed to protect the E protein from conformational changes during the maturation pathway in the acidic environment. the structure of the C protein contains high net charge with an asymmetric distribution of basic residues which lie along the surface of the C protein to orchestrate RNA binding. the opposite surface forms a hydrophobic region which may enable interactions with lipids 147, 148. this configuration makes the C protein essential in virus assembly as it enables encapsulation of the ssRNA genome to form the nucleocapsid 45. a viral serine protease (NS2B-NS3 protease) polyprotein will be cleaved into individual proteins during virus maturation by the host proteases (signalase and furin) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. the NS5 and NS2B (co-factor) proteins were known to play major roles in enzymatic activities for DENV infection. tripeptide 1 (benzoyl-n-Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg-H) and tripeptide 2 (phenylacetyl-Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg-H) were reported to have the most potential as anti-DENV candidates with IC50 of 9.5 M and 6.7 M. further investigation of the tripeptide1 revealed that it bound covalently to the DENV-3 NS2B-NS3 protease and resulted in the strong hydrogen bonds contributed by the P1 and P2' positions were observed but the inhibitory constant value was not as strong as aprotinin (Ki of 0.026 M) this might be due to the flexibility of the cyclic peptide which resulted in the decreased affinity against the protease. however, this study proved the feasibility of designing inhibitors against both prime and non-prime regions of the protease. the arylcyanoacrylamide moiety mimic the first Arg in the P1 position while the Arg-Lys-Nle tripeptide bound to other protein pockets of NS2B-NS3 protease. however, the drug candidate did not have significant antiviral activity in the cell culture against DENV. Nitsche et al. (2013) further optimized the lead candidate via structure activity relationship assays. e hybrid 83 was created by the combination of 4-CF3-benzyl ether and the thiazole cap. tripeptide hybrid 86 was created by the combination of 4-CF3-benzyl ether and the thien-2-yl cap. both peptide hybrids successfully showed improved Ki values of 12 nM and 19 nM respectively. the peptide inhibitor 11 (Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Bip) possessed the best pharmacokinetic properties among all inhibitors due to its ability to be better absorbed into the intestine and to remain inactive in the central nervous system 170. several hexapeptides derived from the NS2A/NS2B region were synthesized and they were shown to inhibit DENV in a low micromolar range 171. a hexapeptide with the highest binding energy of -80.4 kcal/mol against the NS2B-NS3 protease was used to screen against the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease 175. a 13-mer cyclic peptide inhibitor, MrIA, was shown to possess a Ki value of 9 M. cationic cyclic peptide protegrin-1 and retrocyclin-1 against deNV NS2B-NS3 protease 176, 177. protegrin-1, a circular cationic peptide, possessed broad antimicrobial properties against different microorganisms 178. tyr123-Prepro Endothelin (110-130) and urotensin II 181 were shown to bind to the NS5 methyltranserase and formed stable complexes. despite the importance of the NS5 protein, there are limited antiviral peptide screening studies targeting the NS5 protein. various chemical modifications can be applied to manipulate the physicochemical properties of peptides, thereby increasing the stability and bioavailability of the peptides. the substitution of arginine residues with an amino acid derivate of -amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid (Agp) could dramatically reduce the cleavage of peptide by trypsin 187. peptides can be incorporated into the peptide sequence to act as a cargo delivery in carrying antiviral peptide across the permeability barrier and entering cells to exert its inhibitory activity 191. peptides are known to be highly specific and selective against targets, have lower toxicity and low accumulation in tissues. many antiviral peptides against DENV have not been tested in cell-based assays. but none of them has been evaluated in any in vivo study. further studies should focus on elucidating the antiviral potential of these peptides in animal models.
