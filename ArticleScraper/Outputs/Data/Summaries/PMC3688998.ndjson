{"summary": "up to 50,000 human cases of JE are reported annually in Asian countries. a high proportion (nearly 50%) of survivors exhibit permanent sequelae. pigs, as well as birds, serve as amplifying and reservoir hosts. japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex of Flaviviridae includes the west Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEM) cross-reactivity can be demonstrated among these flaviviruses in serological tests. NS1 is more specific in serological testing of flavivirus infections. cell lines, virus and serum Myeloma cell line SP2/0 and baby hamster kidney BHK-21 cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. all culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco) recombinant plasmids were cloned into expression vector pMAL-c5x. recombinant protein was purified by MBPTrap HP column affinity chromatography. recombinant protein was used as an immunogen in mice. soluble recombinant protein was intraperitoneally injected into the mice without adjuvant as a final immunization. three days after final administration, the mice were euthanized humanly. spleen cells were harvested and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells at 51 ratio using polyethylene glycol. all short peptides were purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B RediPack column affinity chromatography according the manufacturer's instructions. all short peptides were expressed as the same way.

NS1-specific MAb heavy chains were identified as IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b. antibody titers of ascitic fluid ranged from 32 to 2048. antibody titers of ascitic fluid were 204,800 or higher. a, The recombinant MBP-NS1 fusion protein was used as antigen in MAbs titration. the titres are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution. b, Virus infected cell lysates are used as antigen in the western blotting assay. mouse anti-sera against JEV NS1 and normal mouse sera were used as positive and negative controls. each bar indicates antibody reactivity as determined by the mean absorbance. fine mapping of epitopes To precisely locate the core sequences of epitopes on NS1 were designed and expressed as a fusion with GST. the deduced minimal unit of each linear B-cell epitope is underlined. NS1 sequences of SA14-14-2 strain were analyzed by Blast in the NCBI Entre protein database. 99 of 100 isolates show 100% sequence identity. all five identified epitopes have less than 50% identity with DENV (1\u20134) NS1 sequences. no positive reaction with MAbs and mouse sera against JEV NS1 was found. no sera against WNV nor DENV reacted with the five JEV NS1 epitopes. the epitope fusion proteins were used as coating antigen in an indirect ELISA. peptides NS1-1, -9, -32, -34 and -43 were identified by 11 MAbs. the peptides correspond to NS1 residues 1\u201316, 65\u201380, 249\u2013264, 265\u2013280 and 337\u2013352 respectively. peptides NS1-1, -9, -32, -34 and -43 were recognized by only one MAb. the highly conserved nature of the epitopes we identified is beneficial for the application of epitopes in vaccine design and epitope-based diagnosis. we then compared the JEV NS1 protein sequence with the NS1 sequences of WNV, MVEV and DENV. there is an urgent need for differential diagnoses between JEV, WNV and DENV."}
