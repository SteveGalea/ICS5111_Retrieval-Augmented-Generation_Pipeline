{"summary": "exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of symptom worsening in COPD that have both short-term and longer-term consequences. they are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and increases in dynamic hyperinflation leading to classical exacerbation symptoms. exacerbations are episodes of worsening of symptoms, and can be defined in terms of a persisting deterioration in respiratory symptoms outside normal day-to-day variation. exacerbations are episodes of worsening of symptoms, and can be defined in terms of a persisting deterioration in respiratory symptoms outside normal day-to-day variation. patients with COPD are slow to perceive exacerbation symptoms and tend not to report exacerbations for therapy. the precise definition of the frequent exacerbator phenotype is problematic and will represent the number of exacerbations where a stable phenotype is present over time. frequent exacerbators appear to be more inflamed with higher levels of sputum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 even in the stable state. a higher CRP during the recovery period is also associated with a shorter time until the next exacerbation. hyperinflation is more likely to be present even in stable disease. bronchodilator therapy may reduce exacerbation frequency even in absence of any anti-inflammatory effects. most of the 40% of acute exacerbations linked to viral infections involve rhinovirus (58%) data from an analysis in the London COPD cohort showed that upper airway colds are more likely to occur in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations. there is also evidence that patients in whom a respiratory virus is detected have a higher exacerbation frequency [24]. 25% of exacerbations involve coinfection with viruses and bacteria. these exacerbations exhibit greater functional impairment, with longer hospitalization [17,24] and are associated with higher airway bacterial load and greater airway inflammation [34]. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CCL-1 gene was predictive of the frequency and severity of exacerbations. a higher frequency of MBL gene polymorphisms was noted in patients with COPD who experience frequent exacerbations. a higher frequency of MBL gene polymorphisms was found in patients with a higher DNA mutation rate. patients who are non-adherent to COPD therapy experience more frequent hospitalizations [51] and have greater healthcare utilization than those who adhere [52]. factors linked to non-adherence include age, complexity of treatment regimen, nature of inhaled delivery device, patient education, and importantly depression [53] a higher CRP during the recovery period is also associated with a shorter time until the next exacerbation [20] may suggest an inflammatory basis to the temporal clustering of exacerbations reported by Hurst et al. most of the 40% of acute exacerbations linked to viral infections involve rhinovirus (58%). other respiratory viruses implicated include human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses. increased viral susceptibility has been proposed as a cause of more frequent exacerbations in COPD [25] frequent exacerbators were not specifically studied in this paper [31]. there are a number of proposed mechanisms of increased viral susceptibility including modulation of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) most rhinovirus serotypes attach to respiratory epithelial cells by binding to ICAM-1 [32] and through this transmembrane protein modulate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. colonization may actually represent a disturbance of the normal microbiome, with subsequent overgrowth of a particular species, which drives the inflammatory process in COPD. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CCL-1 gene was predictive of the frequency and severity of exacerbations. a higher frequency of MBL gene polymorphisms was noted in patients with COPD who experience frequent exacerbations [46]. an increased exacerbation frequency was found in patients whose sputum contained markers suggestive of increased microsatellite DNA instability. this suggests that those patients with a higher DNA mutation rate experience more frequent exacerbations [47] cerbations accelerate lung function decline in patients with frequent exacerbations. a 25% faster decline in FEV1 (-32.1 mL/year vs -40.1 mL/year; P 0.05) Illness Therapy-fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) scale shows worsening of fatigue at exacerbation and worsening scores with increasing exacerbation frequency. activity Peripheral muscle weakness is associated with COPD exacerbations, and muscle force (quadriceps peak torque) was found to be lower at 3 days after admission for an exacerbation than 90 days later. an acute fall in outdoor activity is also seen at exacerbation [67 the risk of death is increased by up to five times following the tenth admission compared to the first [73] every hospitalized exacerbation worsens disease progression. exacerbations were once considered to be of little or no importance. ations per year (both treated and untreated) had poorer health-related quality of life compared patients with zero to two exacerbations per year. other measures of health status, such as the COPD assessment test, have shown a worse score in frequent exacerbators with >2 exacerbations per year of 19.5 compared to 16.8 in patients with 2 exacerbations per year. the risk of death is increased by up to five times following the tenth admission compared to the first. the risk of death is increased by up to five times following the tenth admission compared to the first. patients with comorbid IHD in the London COPD cohort had longer exacerbations, worse health status, more dyspnea and a lower exercise capacity than those without [75] systemic inflammation, a predominant feature of COPD, is strongly associated with cardiovascular risk. levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 are also higher in patients with COPD with cardiovascular disease [78] myocardial infarction and stroke were 10.71, 3.20 and 2.31 respectively, in 2,289 patients, for the 180 days after their first exacerbation compared to the 180 days preceding it [85]. a 2.27-fold increased risk of clinical myocardial infarction in the first 5 days after an exacerbation and 1.26-fold increased risk of stroke in the first 49 days afterwards. two studies have reported a higher exacerbation frequency in patients with GORD symptoms [96,97] and the large ECLIPSE study showed an association between self-reported GORD and having 2 treated exacerbations per year. the reflux is complex, with non-acid and gaseous reflux likely to be prominent in COPD. osteoporosis is common, with a reported prevalence of 35% in patients with COPD [106], and is related to the degree of emphysema seen on computerized tomography (CT) scan. frequent exacerbators have a much larger annual decrease in bone mineral density compared to infrequent exacerbators. patients with comorbid IHD in the London COPD cohort had longer exacerbations, worse health status, more dyspnea and a lower exercise capacity than those without [75] systemic inflammation, a predominant feature of COPD, is strongly associated with cardiovascular risk. levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 are also higher in patients with COPD with cardiovascular disease [78], and frequent exacerbators have higher levels of IL-6 and fibrinogen. evidence from a large observational database in the uk showed a 2.27-fold increased risk of clinical myocardial infarction in the first 5 days after an exacerbation and a 1.26-fold increased risk of stroke in the first 49 days afterwards. patients with exacerbations complicated by pulmonary embolism have a poorer outcome [79] two studies have reported a higher exacerbation frequency in patients with GORD symptoms. the large ECLIPSE study showed an association between self-reported GORD and having 2 treated exacerbations per year. there is a plausible causative mechanism by way of microaspiration of stomach contents causing increased airway inflammation and potentiated by the effect of hyperinflation common in COPD. osteoporosis Osteoporosis is common, with a reported prevalence of 35% in patients with COPD [106], and is related to the degree of emphysema seen on computerized tomography (CT) scan. these patients are already at increased risk due to comorbidities and relative inactivity. some evidence that interventional therapy with an anti-inflammatory agent can modify the frequent exacerbator phenotype such that patients become infrequent exacerbators [110].
