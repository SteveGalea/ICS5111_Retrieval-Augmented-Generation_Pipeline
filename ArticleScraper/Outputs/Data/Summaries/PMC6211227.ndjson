{"summary": "drug discovery is a crucial process to identify candidate compounds, molecules, and biologics that can potentially be developed into clinically effective therapeutics. the associated costs of a successful drug launch can reach $800 million in research and development expenses. nearly 86.2% of drug candidates that make it to phase 1 trials fail to achieve drug approval. the altered growth state of SCV is characterized by a low growth rate, reduced coagulase and hemolytic activity, small colony size on agar plates, absence of pigmentation, antibiotic recalcitrance, and varied auxotrophy for hemin, menadione, and/or thymidine. the reduced susceptibility of SCV to antibiotics is associated with their auxotrophism to menadione, hemin, and/or thy deficiencies in electron transport (menadione and hemin) and/or the thymidylate biosynthetic pathway (30) explain SCV\u2019s ability to survive antibiotic treatment (31, 32) SCV have the ability to persist intracellularly within nonphagocytic cells such as bone, epithelial, and endothelial cells. extracellular AK release from lysed cells can be measured using commercial ToxiLight reporter cocktail based on the ATP-dependent bioluminescent measurement of AK. this AK release assay can be scaled for HTS of a fda-approved drug library containing 853 drug candidates. assay hits were further validated and characterized for their antimicrobial efficacy against wild-type S. aureus small-colony variants. ide, furosemide, milrinone), -lactamase inhibitor (sulbactam), proton pump inhibition (esomeprazole), antioxidant/anthelmintic (genistein), anesthetic (mepivacaine), muscle relaxant (methocarbamol), antihistamine (mizolastine), antiangiogenic/immunomodulator (pomalidomide), to antipsychotic/antidepressant (amitriptyline, data represent average fold increase in adenylate kinase (AK) release in comparison to mock-treated control. each drug showed potent antimicrobial activity resulting in 5-log reduction in viable SCV compared to mock-treated cells. the 22 identified potential drug candidates that exhibited an AK signal that surpassed hit selection criteria were assessed for antimicrobial efficacy against SCV at 100 M. of the 22 hits, 4 drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, demonstrated a 5-log reduction of viable bacteria in comparison to a mock-treated control. antimicrobial susceptibility of 4 validated drugs and gentamicin Drug MIC (g/ml) UAMS-1 USA300 UAMS-1112 (SCV; hemB) UAMS-1 seruma Daunorubicin 8 8 4 8 Ketoconazole 32 32 16

in recovered biofilm-associated CFU. gentamicin and rifapentine induced no more than a 2-fold reduction in recovered biofilm-associated CFU at all concentrations tested. gentamicin did not induce significant cytotoxic effects over the range of concentrations tested. daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin showed the least cytotoxic effects of the candidates tested. cin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin and rifapentine were screened for cytotoxic effects against human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells using an XTT proliferation assay. significance was judged for the effect of each drug concentration versus the mock-treated control. ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin decrease bactericidal activity. no change was observed for daunorubicin in the presence of human serum. serum proteins do not affect its bactericidal activity. n are equivalent to rifampin in their induction of resistant mutants. ketoconazole was the most likely to produce resistant mutants. the addition of a supplemental drug, such as vancomycin, can reduce resistance. rifapentine (an antitubercular agent) and sitafloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) were identified. the remaining 20 varied in therapeutic area classifications. vacaine 1.45 (0.57) Methocarbamol 1.24 (0.05) Milrinone (Primacor) 1.62 (0.86) Mizolastine (Mizollen) 1.59 (0.95) Olanzapine

detectable viable bacteria while ketoconazole, an imidazole antifungal, displayed a 5.52-log reduction relative to the mock-treated control. the remaining 18 hits displayed a 1.5-log reduction relative to the mock-treated control. antimicrobial susceptibility of 4 validated drugs and gentamicin Drug MIC (g/ml) UAMS-1 seruma Daunorubicin 8 8 4 8 Ketoconazole 32 32 16 >128 Rifapentine 0.016

concentration (MBEC) assay. growth medium was supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) human plasma. established biofilms were then challenged with daunorubicin, ketoconazole, sitafloxacin, rifapentine, or gentamicin for 24 h. biofilm was challenged by 1 to 128 g/ml of each of the 4 validated HTS drugs and gentamicin (D) sitafloxacin significantly killed biofilm at concentrations 4 to 128 g/ml. daunorubicin and ketoconazole showed significant cytotoxic effects. gentamicin, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin were screened for cytotoxic effects against human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. antimicrobial activity against UAMS-1 in human serum was also evaluated to investigate the bioactivity of each drug in the presence of serum proteins. the MIC was generally increased reflecting >4-, 62.5-, 15.63-, and 4-fold decreases in bactericidal activity for ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and gentamicin in the presence of human serum. ifapentine and rifampin all had similar spontaneous resistance frequencies at 2 or 4 MIC. but sitafloxacin showed an order of magnitude higher resistance frequency at 2 or 4 MIC. rifapentine and sitafloxacin are equivalent to rifampin in their induction of resistant mutants. novel drug discovery and development are essential for efficacious treatments against SCV-related chronic infections. poor profitability and uncertain regulatory requirements for market approval have slowed discovery initiatives from large pharmaceutical companies. drug discovery is notoriously slow, expensive, and high-risk process. antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, cationic compounds, and antifolates, have less activity against SCV due to their lower membrane potential relative to NCP (15, 50, 51) however, some antibiotics belonging to the families of rifamycins and fluoroquinolones have shown effectiveness against SCV in vitro. this is the first time these two specific drugs have been identified to directly kill SCV. antifungal, have previously been shown to have a bactericidal mode of action against S. aureus SCV. however, this is the first study to confirm their bactericidal effectiveness against S. aureus SCV. both sitafloxacin and daunorubicin inhibit DNA synthesis by acting upon type II DNA topoisomerases. sitafloxacin was developed in japan and approved in 2008 for treating respiratory and urinary tract infections. this is significant since implant-associated osteomyelitis is a chronic infection associated with both SCV and biofilm. this approach has decided advantages in saving money and time as opposed to novel drug development. 18 of 22 identified hits had a 1-log reduction against SCV, resulting in an 82% false-positive hit rate. this rate could be reduced by refining the selection criteria for positive hits. however, this would come at the risk of missing positive hit identification. clinically used antibiotics in the treatment of established, implant-associated osteomyelitis in a preclinical rodent model (65). bacterial strains consist of S. aureus strain UAMS-1112, a stable SCV of the common laboratory S. aureus strain 8325-4, which contains a hemB deletion. 35-h cultures of the stable S. aureus SCV strain, UAMS-1112 (hemB), were grown in MH medium at 37\u00b0C at 225 rpm. cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm; 10 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of MH medium. a higher screening concentration was used in comparison to previous studies to ensure hit identification against the resilient nature of SCV (35, 36). MIC testing was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines (66) wells of a 96-well plate were inoculated with 1 105 CFU/ml of either UAMS-1112, UAMS-1, or USA300. this assay was also performed in the presence of human serum instead of MH media. biofilms were tested for susceptibility against validated HTS hits and gentamicin as a clinically relevant control. overnight cultures of UAMS-1 were adjusted to 1 106 CFU/ml in TSB supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) pooled human plasma. plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 110 rpm. growth control pegs were broken off, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and gold sputter coated prior to imaging. differences were considered significant for P 0.05. cells were incubated for an additional 3 h, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a bioTek Synergy Mx plate reader. differences were considered significant for P 0.05. an 853-member FDA-approved drug library was screened against SCV. AK assays were carried out as previously described with modifications to account for slower growth of UAMS-1112 (35, 36) nescent values normalized to the mock-treated growth control with values greater than or equal to the overall mean plus two times the standard deviation. additional hits were selected by removing select plates that had increased noise relative to the overall data. OD600 of 0.2, were concentrated to 1 109 CFU/ml by centrifuging (13.3 g; 2 min) 1 ml of culture and resuspending in 100 l. the plates were supplemented with 2 and 4 the MIC of daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and rifampin. growth control pegs were broken off, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and gold sputter coated prior to imaging. 96-well microtiter plate at 1 104 cells/well allowed to attach overnight for 18 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. gentamicin was diluted in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PEN-STR. cells were then rinsed with PBS, and medium was replaced with DMEM without phenol red."}
