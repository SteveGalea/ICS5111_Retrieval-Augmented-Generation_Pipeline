{"summary": "indirubin is the active ingredient of a mixture of plants used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat chronic diseases. indirubin derivatives are potent inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases and some other pharmacologically important kinases. it is possible that drugs containing the isatin moiety may compete with endogenous isatin. metabolism Isatin was originally identified as one component of the endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity, tribulin. highest concentrations in the brain are in hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum (1\u20131.3 M), while in peripheral organs the highest concentrations are in seminal vesicles and vas deferens. isatin concentrations have been calculated using data on tissue isatin content and water content in various tissues of the rat. nal vesicles and vas deferens have been calculated using data on tissue isatin content (0.861 ml/g) all these compounds have been found in urine (Usami et al 2001; Medvedev and Glover 2004). it remains unclear whether indigoid formation precedes urinary excretion and aerobic transformation of the urinary components. at least for basal isatin, urinary but not tissue levels are largely produced by the gut flora. MAO B with isatin led to improved crystal quality. other putative isatin binding sites in the rat brain include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide. this inhibits [3H]isatin-binding to rat brain sections and isolated membrane fractions. Isatin-binding proteins Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) is an important glycolytic enzyme. it catalyses the reaction of a phosphoryl group transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP in the reaction of substrate phosphorylation: Phosphoenolpyruvate + ATP. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) is a classical glycolytic enzyme. GAPDH specifically interacts with different RNAs in vivo and in vitro. translocation of GAPDH into the nucleus can be an important event leading to apoptosis. isatin is a highly conserved 8 kDa protein, which is covalently attached to lysine residues of target proteins by the ubiquitin conjugation system. the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of regulatory proteins plays important roles in the control of numerous processes. the ubiquitin system is involved into the immune response, development, programmed cell death, and abnormalities in ubiquitin-mediated processes may be a cause for development of various pathological conditions. we have recently demonstrated that ubiquitin binds to an isatin analogue immobilized at the Biacore cell (Buneeva et al 2004) inhibition 50% caused by 1 M isatin Inhibition 50% caused by 10 M isatin Inhibition 20%\u201340% caused by 10 M isatin Inhibition 20% caused by 10 M isatin Receptor binding. it is possible to obtain pharmacologically attractive compounds acting as effective inhibitors of these regulatory systems. giotensin II, type 2; vasopressin-I; bombesin; endothelin B; substance P; CCKA; CCKB neuropeptide Y; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; giotensin-I; giotensin-I; giotensin- natriuretic peptide receptor type C lacks the cyclase domain. third receptor lacks the cyclase domain and binds all three peptides. Isatin inhibited [125I]ANP binding to guinea pig cerebellar membranes. Isatin administration blocked cyclic GMP excretion under conditions of fluid overload. this is known to induce endogenous ANP release. this provides further evidence that isatin can antagonise NPR-A signaling in vivo. isatin antagonizes natriuretic peptide receptors in situ and in vivo. guanylate cyclase is the other enzyme catalyzing cGMP formation from GTP. it is activated by NO (formed from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase) treatment of cells with 60\u2013100 M isatin reduced ERK activity and significantly reduced phosphrylation of the EKR2 isoform. cell cultures Isatin can induce cell death, including apoptosis in some tumor cells. [3H]isatin imaging in situ has shown pattern of isatin-binding sites in different parts of the rat brain. highest labeling was found in hypothalamic nuclei, in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. this suggests that MAO is one of the isatin-binding sites in situ. sites have been shown in both particulate and soluble fractions of the brain and peripheral rat tissues. in the brain isatin-binding predominated in the membrane fraction. in the kidneys the highest binding was observed in the soluble fractions. this interaction appeared to be specific as the other enzyme of this class, creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) did not exhibit concentration dependent binding of [3H]isatin. this interaction was sensitive to inhibition by ATP (IC50 of 25 M) and by a neuroprotective preparation, deprenyl (IC50 of 5 M) the translocation of GAPDH into the nucleus can be an important event leading to apoptosis. there is increasing evidence that GAPDH may serve as a target for small-molecule anti-apoptotic compounds slowing/preventing progression of neurodegenerative disorders. besides these pharmacological substances GAPDH can also bind isatin with Kd values (of 12 and 3.1 M, determined by two independent methods respectively) highly purified rabbit muscle GPDH effectively binds to isatin analogue immobilised on the cuvette of IAsys optical biosensor. replacement of cuvette medium did not cause total dissociation of GPDH-isatin complexes. possible biological significance of this regulation remains unclear. Isatin-binding proteins Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) catalyses the reaction of a phosphoryl group transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP in the reaction of substrate phosphorylation. the Kd value of 10 M was at the upper physiological range of isatin concentrations (Buneeva et al 2006). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) is a classical glycolytic enzyme. it exhibits diverse nonglycolytic functions in dependence of its subcellular localization. the translocation of GAPDH into the nucleus can be an important event leading to apoptosis. isatin is a highly conserved 8 kDa protein, which is covalently attached to lysine residues of target proteins by the ubiquitin conjugation system. this metabolic pathway is often used for the selective proteasome degradation of many short-lived proteins in eukaryotic cells. the ubiquitin system is involved into the immune response, development, programmed cell death, and abnormalities in ubiquitin-mediated processes may be a cause for development of various pathological conditions. we have recently demonstrated that ubiquitin binds to an isatin analogue immobilized at the Biacore cell (Buneeva et al 2004) inhibition 50% caused by 1 M isatin Inhibition 50% caused by 10 M isatin Inhibition 20%\u201340% caused by 10 M isatin Inhibition 20% caused by 10 M isatin Receptor binding. the presence of various substituents in the isatin moiety significantly increased biological activity to particular targets. in II, type 2; vasopressin-I; bombesin-I; endothelin B; substance P; CCKA; CCKB neuropeptide Y; neurotensin; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y; neurotensin; somatostatin; CCKB neuropeptide Y natriuretic peptide receptor type C lacks the cyclase domain. third receptor lacks the cyclase domain and binds all three peptides. Isatin inhibited [125I]ANP binding to guinea pig cerebellar membranes. Isatin administration blocked cyclic GMP excretion under conditions of fluid overload. this is known to induce endogenous ANP release. this provides further evidence that isatin can antagonise NPR-A signaling in vivo. isatin antagonizes natriuretic peptide receptors in situ and in vivo. guanylate cyclase is the other enzyme catalyzing cGMP formation from GTP. it is activated by NO (formed from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase) treatment of cells with 60\u2013100 M isatin reduced ERK activity and significantly reduced phosphrylation of the EKR2 isoform. cell cultures Isatin can induce cell death, including apoptosis in some tumor cells. atin effect on expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) respectively. natriuretic peptides interact with three types of membrane receptor. two of them, natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPR-A) and natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-B), are transmembrane glycoproteins exhibiting ligand-dependent intrinsic Isatin inhibited [125I]ANP binding to guinea pig cerebellar membranes. the IC50 of 0.4 M is within the lower limit of the physiological range of isatin concentrations. isatin in situ blocks the effect of ANP on hyperpolarization-activated current in human atrial myocytes involving cyclic GMP signaling. satin administration has been shown to block cyclic GMP excretion under conditions of fluid overload. isatin may also inhibit natriuretic peptide signaling associated with NPR-C. this is consistent with isatin inhibition of ANP, BNP and CNP-induced behavioral effects. the enzyme plays an important role in vasodilation. it has been shown that basal activity of the human platelet guanylate cyclase is not sensitive to isatin. the NO-stimulated activity is inhibited by low physiological concentrations of isatin. cane et al (2000) observed antiproliferative effect of isatin in both tumor and normal cells. effective concentration required for a 50% effect was at the upper limits of physiological concentrations or higher (10\u201350 M) some of them are effective anticonvulsants and anxyolytics. the specific biological targets responsible for these diverse effects are not all known. caspases Caspases are a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases. there are at least 14 caspases known to date, which play a significant role in apoptosis and inflammation. the simple isatin analogue, 5-nitroisatin effectively inhibited caspase-7 (Ki 0.29 M), caspase-3 (Ki 0.50 M), and caspase-6 (Ki 1.6 M) the compound exhibited 100-fold greater selectivity for highly homologous caspase-3 and -7 vs all other family members except caspase-9 (Ki of 460 nM) cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are key regulators of cell cycle progression. they represent novel potential targets for therapy in autoimmune disease and organ transplantation. indirubins exhibit a strong affinity for CDKs. s cultivated in the presence of 5-methylindole or 5-methoxyindole inhibited human CDK-1 and -5 with IC50 values of 0.4\u20131.2 M. indirubins effectively inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) with IC50 values in the 5\u201350 nM range. this kinase is involved in multiple physiological processes, including cell cycle regulation by controlling the levels of cyclin aminopyrimidinimino isatin derivatives inhibited replication of HIV type 1 in T4 lymphocytes. their effectiveness was significantly lower than that of the reference standard Nevirapine (Sriram et al 2005). 1 M N-methyl isatin -thiosemicarbazone (Me-IBT) inhibited Rous sarcoma virus RNA-dependent DNA polymerase by 50%. in combination with 1 M CuSO4, it caused nearly total inhibition of the enzyme activity. the inhibition of NO and PGE2 production in LPS-INF- is obviously associated with the effect of isatin. authors believe that isatin analogues may be considered as the lead compounds for the development of inhibitors modulating drug metabolism in vivo. isatin protects MAO B against irreversible inhibiton by mechanism based inhibitors phenelzine and pargyline. proteases Isatin analogues possessing various substituents at R-R''''' and R'''''''''' were active against SARS coronavirus 3CL protease (belonging to the family of serine proteases) the IC50 values were within the concentration range from 0.95 to 17.50 M. there are at least 14 caspases known to date, which play a significant role in apoptosis and inflammation. there are at least 14 caspases known to date, which play a significant role in apoptosis and inflammation. 5-nitroisatin inhibited caspase-7 (Ki 0.29 M), caspase-3 (Ki 0.50 M), and caspase-6 (Ki 1.6 M) the simple isatin analogue, 5-nitroisatin effectively inhibited caspase-7 (Ki 0.29 M), caspase-3 (Ki 0.50 M), and caspase-6 (Ki 1.6 M) several CDK inhibitory drugs are at various stages of clinical trials as antitumor agents. there is evidence that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are major regulators of T cell immunity and tolerance. e-3 (GSK-3) with IC50 values in the 5\u201350 nM range. kinase involved in cell cycle regulation by controlling levels of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al 1998), insulin effect on glycogen synthesis (Cohen 1999; Summers et al 1996), axonal outgrowth (Lucas et al 1998), HIV-1 Tat mediated neurotoxicity. in vitro assay revealed that compounds possessing anti-HIV-1 activity did inhibit reverse transcriptase. their IC50 values of 20\u201340 M were several times higher than their EC50 for the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in MT-4 cell culture. the isatin analogues, 5-Fluoroisatin, 5-Chloroisatin, 6-Chloroisatin, 7-Chloroisatin, and 5-methylisatin inhibited production of nitric oxide and PGE2 TNF- by a mixture of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon. but their effectiveness insignificantly differ from the effect of isatin. isatin analogues may be considered as the lead compounds for the development of inhibitors modulating drug metabolism in vivo. there is evidence that isatin protects MAO B against irreversible inhibiton by mechanism based inhibitors phenelzine (Panova et al 1997) and pargyline (Medvedev et al 1997). Isatin can be present in blood in the micromolar range and increases in response to stress. this suggests that endogenous isatin may affect the sensitivity of biological targets to therapeutics employed a range of diseases and disorders."}
