{"summary": "cleavage occurs upon biogenesis and viral egress for some coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or MERS-CoV (20) the critical importance of cleavage at the S1/S2 site is also exemplified by the Bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV) HKU4. coronaviruses have redundancy built into their S protein sequence. several coronaviruses have redundancy built into their S protein sequence. we observed particles exhibiting the globular prefusion architecture and particles featuring an elongated cone-like structure reminiscent of the postfusion conformation described for paramyxovirus F proteins. these observations suggest that the three S ectodomains could refold to the postfusion conformation upon proteolytic activation. MHV S2 trimers are 190-kDa cone-shaped particles resembling those shown in Fig. 1B. we built and refined a model including residues 741\u20131,248, with an internal break between residues 808-971, using Coot (28), Rosetta de novo (29), RosettaES (30), and Rosetta density-guided refinement. coronavirus S six-helix bundle fragments (14\u201316) could be superimposed with good agreement onto refined structure. reconstruction resolves several intrachain disulfide bonds (Cys775\u2013Cys797, Cys780\u2013Cys786, Cys1082\u2013Cys1093, and Cys1132\u2013Cys1177) between pairs of cysteine residues that are conserved in the MHV, HCoV-NL63, SARS- some of these sites are resolved in the cryoEM map (Asn754, Asn1180, and Asn1190) with the correct sequence context, further validating the assigned register (Fig. S3 G\u2013J and Table S2). the MHV S2 fusion machinery ectodomain resolves a long central triple helical bundle surrounded by three antiparallel HR2 helices forming a six-helix bundle at one end. at the opposite end is a triangular pyramidal base comprised of the N terminus of the S2 subunit and the connector domain. fusion peptide and transmembrane regions are located at the same end of the cone-like structure, unlike in the prefusion structure. these conformational changes are believed to be crucial to mediate membrane fusion. refolding can occur in the absence of proteolytic processing in the context of an isolated ectodomain. similar conformational changes take place in all coronaviruses during fusion. we postulate that similar conformational changes take place in all coronaviruses. the fusion peptide region (22, 33) and the HR1 N-terminal moiety were resolved in the MHV S prefusion conformation. these residues are not visible in the postfusion map, suggesting that they are highly dynamic in the absence of the target membrane and transmembrane domain. targeting this segment with antibodies or other types of inhibitors could prevent the insertion of the fusion peptide into the host membrane and putatively block refolding. the most C-terminal part of the postfusion connector domain undergoes extensive refolding to adopt a domain-swapped organization. it contributes a fourth strand (residues 1,178\u20131,184) to the three-stranded core -sheet of a different protomer and folds as an extended segment interacting with the central coiled coil in an antiparallel orientation. the previously unresolved C-terminally adjacent region folds postfusion MHV fusion machinery buries 6,150 2 of surface area per protomer at the interface with other subunits of the trimer. MHV postfusion S2 (pink) connector domains emphasizing their structural conservation. central helix region appears to act as a pseudorigid scaffold around which refolding of the fusion machinery takes place. substitution in the HR1 region introduces bulkier amino acid side chain that could alter the packing of the postfusion S2 central coiled coil and potentially disturb the formation of the six-helix bundle with the HR2 C-terminal helices. coronavirus fusion machinery, however, is at least 10 longer than paramyxovirus F glycoproteins (without considering the unresolved S HR1 N-terminal region) the coronavirus fusion machinery, however, is at least 10 longer than paramyxovirus F glycoproteins (without considering the unresolved S HR1 N-terminal region) coronavirus S2 and paramyxovirus F glycoproteins are observed extending along the periphery of each neighboring protomer. the core -sheet of each fusion subunit is supplemented by a -strand contributed in an identical manner by the connector domain of a neighboring subunit. refolding of coronavirus S and paramyxovirus F proteins likely proceeds through a similar zippering reaction. the postfusion MHV S2 trimer is depicted with each protomer in a different color. the transmembrane helices and the fusion peptides are connected to the MHV S trimer with dotted and solid lines. the fusion peptides (FP) are connected to the MHV S trimer. transmembrane protease/serine protease processing of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S at the cell membrane. furin-mediated processing of human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and MERS-CoV S are key events that enable fusion activation and coronavirus entry into host cells. fusion uncleaved MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV S glycoprotein ectodomains with trypsin. cleavage occurred at or near the predicted S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites. this suggests that we recapitulated the proteolytic activation mechanism taking place in vivo. frozen-hydrated MHV S2 trimers are 190-kDa cone-shaped particles resembling those shown in Fig. 1B. the structure was fused to a GCN4 trimerization motif at the C-terminal end (27) the atomic model was validated using a multipronged approach, including comparison with known fragment structures. the tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain corresponding to the upstream helix and the core -sheet remain virtually identical to the prefusion structure. cysteine residues are conserved in the MHV, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1 S glycoproteins. these covalent links are maintained during the transition from the prefusion to the postfusion conformation. some sites are resolved in the cryoEM map (Asn754, Asn1180, and Asn1190) with the correct sequence context. as a blue mesh, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are colored gray, blue, and red, respectively.
