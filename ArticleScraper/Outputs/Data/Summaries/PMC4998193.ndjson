{"summary": "ARDS is a common and severe lung disease that is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. the characteristic features of ARDS include excessively uncontrolled inflammation, hypoxemia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema formation. the main sites of cell injury in ARDS are the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium (4). NF-B is a critical nuclear transcription factor, able to activate the transcription of a number of inflammatory cytokine genes and regulate the inflammatory response and immunoreaction (12). Typically, NF-B exists as an inactive dimer in the cytoplasm and directly combines with an inhibitor of nuclear-factor B (IB) to produce a trimeric complex. CINC and ENA-78 regulate NF-B phosphorylation and inhibit NF-B activation. mice were allowed free access to water and standard laboratory chow. PDTC was administered 30 min prior the injection of LPS. the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (3.5 ml/kg; Sigma-Aldrich), prior to sacrifice via aortic phlebotomy at the indicated time points. the left lung was prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and immunohistochemistry, while the right lung was prepared for western blot analysis. inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, interstitial and alveolar edema and thickness of the alveolar septum in five random fields in a blind manner using a light microscope. the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen partial pressure was analyzed in 150-l arterial blood samples. the oxygen partial pressure was calculated according to the results of a blood gas analysis. the samples were placed on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 12,000 g for 2 min in order to produce the aspirate supernatant (nucleoprotein) the membrane was washed three times for 5 min each with 1X TBS containing 0.15 Tween-20. the membrane was then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000;

NF-B is a target for anti-inflammatory ARDS treatment. NF-B is a central transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines, adhesion molecules and chemokines by specifically binding to B promoters in the nucleus. previous studies have shown that when NF-B is excessively activated, IL-8 and TNF- are overexpressed, whereas IL-10 is decreased, in ARDS (20). in patients with ARDS, the body can prevent excessive activation of the inflammatory response by activating an anti-inflammatory response and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-10 is a crucial anti-inflammatory cytokine in the immune response and can inhibit the production of IL-8 and TNF- in monocytes and macrophages. overexpression can aggravate the immune response (17,32) CINC mRNA and protein inhibits PMN apoptosis and activates a large number of PMNs, causing them to accumulate in the lung and result in lung injury (11). endogenous TNF- is associated with the increased expression of ENA-78. the NF-B signaling pathway may become an important target in regulating ARDS in the lung. this suggests that the NF-B signaling pathway may become an important target in regulating ARDS in the lung. this suggests that it may be useful in investigating the pathogenesis of ARDS."}
