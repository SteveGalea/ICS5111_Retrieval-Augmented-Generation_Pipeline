{"summary": "HSP is one of the most common forms of vasculitis in children with 10 to 30 cases reported per 100,000 children under 17 years of age. it is estimated to be 15 cases/100,000 per year in children compared with 1.3 cases/100,000 per year in adults. there have been no studies using national health big data showing a direct relationship between HSP and various infectious diseases. in south Korea, HSP is a relatively common disease, but reports on the overall developmental patterns in children and adolescents in recent years are lacking. however, only studies that investigate its epidemiology in individual hospitals are available. the patients diagnosed with HSP were categorized into the 4 age groups according to the classifications developed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. the patients who visited outpatient clinics or emergency rooms and all patients who received hospitalization were surveyed by week, month, season, and year. a virus that causes an infectious disease is detected a few days after the disease has developed. the correlation analysis was confirmed that the P value was 0.05 and the correlation coefficient was >0.5. we used the decomposition of additive time series analysis and correlation analysis to compare the incidence of the virus and the prevalence of each virus. the patients diagnosed with HSP were categorized into the 4 age groups according to the classifications developed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. the patients were categorized into the 4 age groups according to the classifications developed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. we used the decomposition of additive time series analysis and correlation analysis to compare the incidence of HSP and the prevalence of each virus. results 3.1. Epidemiology of pediatric HSP patients From January 2013 to December 2016, 16,940 patients under the age of 18 were diagnosed with HSP in south Korea. the monthly analysis revealed that while the largest number of cases were diagnosed in March (1949, 11.5%), the smallest number was reported in August (959, 5.7%) there were no gender differences in the monthly, seasonal, and yearly incidences of newly diagnosed Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura patients. bocavirus was more prevalent in late spring and early summer than in other seasons. metapneumovirus was more prevalent in April and may. bocavirus was more prevalent in late spring and early summer than in other seasons. there were 8126 boys (48.0%) and 8814 girls (52.0%), and the mean age was 7.77 4.73 years. the rate of hospitalization was lowest in the summer when 481 (14.9%) of the 3224 diagnosed patients were admitted. over 4 years, 15 patients (0.09%) underwent surgical treatments for intussusception or perforation. 290 (7.3%), 237 (6.0%), 254 (6.4%), and 269 (6.8%) patients were diagnosed in the summer. more patients were diagnosed in the summer than in the fall. SP compared the epidemic patterns of 8 respiratory and 4 enteric viruses with the onset of HSP. the epidemic patterns of influenza virus and rotavirus were statistically similar to those of HSP. no significant correlations were detected in the infant group. studies on viral infections as the leading cause of HSP have limitations. this is the first study to investigate the relationship between HSP and preceding infectious diseases using the national health data from the HIRA and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases. some of the known infectious causes of HSP were identified. adenovirus did not show any significant seasonal tendency. rotavirus has not been previously reported as predisposing cause. study suggests the possibility of a causative disease by confirming the coincidence of HSP and some viruses that were not previously linked to HSP such as rotavirus, norovirus, or bocavirus. if the virus itself is not as severe as rhinovirus, its detection rate would have been much lower than that of other viruses. the study will be the first to investigate an association between the occurrence of HSP and outbreaks of different viruses using the national health data. it is necessary to confirm the exact causal relationships through further long-term epidemiological studies."}
