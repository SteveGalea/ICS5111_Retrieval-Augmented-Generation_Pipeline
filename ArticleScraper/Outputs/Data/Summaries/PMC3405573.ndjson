{"summary": "infection due to community-acquired respiratory viruses is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among patients with hematologic malignancy. long-term decline in pulmonary function has been demonstrated in survivors of lung transplant and HSCT (2\u20135, 7, 11) mixed infections with two or more respiratory viruses are common in children but are not easily detected by conventional methods. the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) received FDA clearance for the detection of 15 viruses and subtypes. these assays included the viral targets in xTAG RVP plus human coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43), bocavirus, and PIV4. retrospective study conducted on banked specimens collected from pediatric patients. upper and lower respiratory tract infection was defined as the presence of rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, otitis, and sinusitis. lower respiratory tract infection was defined as the presence of cough, wheezing, dyspnea, or abnormal lung findings. all swabs were collected using flocked swabs (FLoQwabs; Copan, Murrieta, CA) each specimen (0.2 ml) was inoculated into three cells lines, a primary rhesus monkey kidney (RMK; Viromed, Minnetonka, MN) and two human lung diploid fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5; Viromed, Minnetonka, MN; and WI-38; Diagnostic Hybrids RT-PCR was performed on a myCycler thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the following cycling parameters: 1 preheating step at 50\u00b0C for 20 min; 1 template denaturing cycle at 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 34 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 59\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s; and ending with 1 cycle at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. the RVP FilmArray test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. a hydration solution vial was added to the pouch using a transfer pipette. the resulting mixture was transferred to the pouch using the sample loading syringe. three hundred fifty-eight respiratory specimens were tested in this study. from July 2010 to January 2011, 303 consecutive samples received in the laboratory from pediatric patients were tested. these included nasopharyngeal swabs (NP; n = 280), bronchial washings and lavages (BW/BL; n = 8), throat swabs (TS; n = 13), and sputum (SPEX;2). a primary rhesus monkey kidney (RMK; Viromed, Minnetonka, MN; and WI-38; Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH) were incubated at 37\u00b0C (RMK and MRC-5; Viromed, Minnetonka, MN; and WI-38; Diagnostic Hybrids, athens, OH) a shell vial was set up in LLC-MK2 cells and read after 48 h. reagents, the xTAG RVP Fast bead mix, the reporter buffer, and the xTAG streptavidin and phycoerythrin G15 conjugate were vortexed before use. each hybridization reaction mixture contained 20 l of bead mix, 2 l of amplified DNA, and 75 l of SA-PE G15. the gold standard used to determine true-positive and false-negative results was a combination gold standard. any specimen that was positive by only one of the molecular assays was resolved by a review of medical records. additional testing was performed using the Resplex II assay (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) fourteen patients (8%) did not have any respiratory symptoms. a total of 47 specimens were positive by only one of the two PCR assays. the remaining specimens (30/73) were tested by Resplex II assay. the remaining specimens (30/73) were tested by Resplex II assay as shown in Table 3.

FA RVP pouches are available in boxes of 30 tests, with pricing listed at $3,870 for a cost of $129/pouch. all controls for the assay are internal to the pouch. xTAG RVP FAST and FA RVP detected additional viruses. it would take 26 h (65 min per specimen) to perform 24 FA RVP tests on one instrument. it would take 26 h (65 min per specimen) to perform 24 tests on one instrument. xTAG RVP Fast and FA RVP had significantly higher sensitivities for the detection of respiratory viruses than traditional methods, such as DFA and viral culture. the difference in sensitivity between the two assays remained statistically significant when only confirmed positive isolates were considered. the detection rate for flu A was similar in both assays, with the added advantage of the specific detection of the 2009 H1N1 Flu A by FA RVP. the detection rate for flu A was similar in both assays, with the added advantage of the specific detection of the 2009 H1N1 Flu A by FA RVP as opposed to being labeled an untypeable result. bocavirus is a recently identified parvovirus (1), and its clinical significance as a respiratory pathogen has not been fully elucidated (22). 3 patients were infected with confirmed bocavirus, and 2 had dual infections with rhinovirus, coronavirus, and flu B. xTAG RVP Fast was FDA cleared in may 2011 for the detection of 15 viruses and subtypes, including influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype H1, influenza A virus subtype H1, influenza A virus subtype H1 (2009), influenza A virus subtype H3, influenza B virus, RSV, hMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus HKU1 FA RVP was more sensitive than xTAG RVP Fast, with a turnaround time of approximately 1 h for each specimen. simplicity and random-access characteristic make it an excellent choice in a hospital with low to medium volume and on-demand urgent service."}
