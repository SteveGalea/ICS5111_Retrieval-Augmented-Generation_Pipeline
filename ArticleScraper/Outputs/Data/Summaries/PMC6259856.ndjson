{"summary": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped and positively single-stranded RNA virus. the viral envelope is a lipid bilayer enbedded with three viral transmembrane proteins. the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV is protected and packaged by the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein by forming a helical structure of ribonucleoprotein complex within the viral envelope. SARS-CoV infection is a life-threatening disease that often develops with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. N protein induces the pro-inflammatory responses by activating the promoter activity of either cyclooxygenase-2 or IL-6 by directly interacting with the NFB binding element. at least 23 targeted sites of N gene specific siRNAs have been selected and tested. all these known siRNAs are located at 2/3 of the 5\u2019 N gene sequence (within first 860nt out of the total 1269nt) nucleotide substitution and deletion mutations can be frequently recovered from the first 440nt sequence of N gene. a total of five sequence alterations (two sequence deletions and three nucleotide substitutions) occurred in the N gene in these isolates. a known siRNA (si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240) targeting at 727nt, respectively, is also indicated. no targeted site has been selected for the last 410nt sequence. the selected targeted sites were at +213+233nt, +863+883nt and +1240+1260nt relative to the 5\u2019 ATG initiation codon. a known siRNA that targeted the 5\u2019 terminus (+7+27nt) of N gene was also constructed for control purposes. hek293 cells were transfected with either pCMV-Myc or pCMV-Myc-Np. the transfected cells were subjected to immunostaining analysis. pEGFP-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-N213 or si-N863 into HEK293 cells. pEGFP-Np was co-transfected with increased dose of either pBS/U6-si-N213 or pBS/U6-si-N863 into HEK293 cells. pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-M3 or si-N213 into HEK293 cells. fluorescence intensity (MFI) of EGFP-Np fusion gene expression in the absence or presence of si-N213 was detected by flow cytometric analysis. a non-specific siRNA, si-M3, was served as a non-specific control. si-M3 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor to SARS-CoV M gene expression [25,26] pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of pBS/U6-si-N863 into HEK293 cells. after 48 h, the transfected cells were lysed. equal amount of cell lysates were resolved onto 12% SDS-PAGE. pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of pBS/U6-si-N1240 into HEK293 cells. after 48 h, the transfected cells were lysed. equal amount of cell lysates were resolved onto 12% SDS-PAGE. 1.4 g of pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with 4.2 g of each plasmid pBS/U6, si-N#16, si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240 into targeted cells. si-N#16, si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240 all induced significant inhibition on the isolated N gene expression as compared with that of the vector control. pCMV-Myc-M was co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-Np in the presence or absence of N gene specific siRNAs. pCMV-Myc-M was co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-Np in the presence or absence of N gene specific siRNAs into HEK293 cells. SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus frequently associated with sequence alterations during viral transmission. a better siRNA should be designed to target the conserved region in the targeted sequence. a total of five sequence alterations occurred in the N gene in these isolates. the N gene also possesses two additional single nucleotide substitutions (nt74 and nt1128) and one single nucleotide deletion (nt384). a known siRNA (No.16) targeting at 727nt is also indicated. expression of N gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. expression of N gene was then subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Myc to generate a pCMV-Myc-Np plasmid construct. HEK293 cells were transfected with either pEGFP-C or pEGFP-Np. the transfected cells were probed with either PBS (mock) or anti-Myc antibody as primary antibody. pEGFP-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-N213 or si-N863 into HEK293 cells. pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of pBS/U6-si-N213 into HEK293 cells. after 48 h, the transfected cells were lysed. equal amount of cell lysates were resolved onto 12% SDS-PAGE. si-N863, which targeted at the 3\u2019 half of N gene, also inhibited N protein expression by about four-fold when the molar ratio of si-N863: N reached 6:1 (Figure 5a and 5b) the specificity of si-N863 mediated N gene repression was demonstrated by the fact that higher doses of si-N863, but not si-M3, dramatically inhibited EGFP-Np gene expression. pEGFP-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of si-N1240. pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with increased doses of si-M3. after 48 h, transfected cells were lysed. about 2 g of pEGFP-Np plasmid was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-M3 or si-N1240. the mean fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Np fusion gene expression in the absence or presence of si-N1240 was detected by flow cytometric analysis. the results provide strong evidence to show that all three novel siRNAs (si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240) are specific 1.4 g of pCMV-Myc-Np was co-transfected with 4.2 g of each plasmid si-N#16, si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240. both -actin-R and SARS-N-R primers were used in this analysis. pCMV-Myc-M was co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-Np in the presence or absence of N gene specific siRNAs into HEK293 cells. 1 g of total RNA isolated from each reaction was subjected to RT-PCR analysis with IFN, M. N or -actin specific primers. the amplified full length of the N gene was first subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector. after confirmation by sequencing analysis, the N gene products were released by EcoRI/KpnI double digestion and then subcloned into the respective sites of pCMV-Myc. oligos siN-213-F and siN-213-Re, siN-863-F and siN-863-Re, siN-1240-F and siN-1240-Re were annealed pair-wisely to form duplexes. the duplex products were then subcloned into pBS/U6 [29] to form pBS/U6-siN213, pBS/U6-siN863, pBS/ all primers used in RT-PCR reactions were listed in Table 1. one g of total RNAs was first reverse transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO4, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 M PMSF. transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl ( nitrocellular membrane (Pharmacia) was first probed with a primary antibody. a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase was added to the reaction and visualized with an ECL kit. cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. pCMV-Myc generates pCMV-Myc-N. the N gene products were also inserted into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector to form pEGFP-Np fusion gene construct. the oligos siN-213-F and siN-213-Re, siN-863-F and siN-863-Re, siN-1240-F and siN-1240-Re were annealed pair-wisely to form duplexes. the duplex products were then subcloned into pBS/U6 [29]. real time qRT-PCR was carried out with iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 42 \u00b0C for 5min and 95 \u00b0C for 10sec; 95 \u00b0C for 5 sec and 60 \u00b0C for 10 sec. the dissociation of the reaction products was conducted from 55 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C as the temperature rose at 0.2 \u00b0C per ten seconds. transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO4, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 M PMSF. the reaction mixture was evenly distributed into the cell culture medium and incubated for 48 hours before harvesting. previous studies on M gene specific siRNAs indicate that the siRNA targeting site and its surrounding sequences may influence the inhibitory effect. the current study further supports this observation by showing that si-N#16, which targets a twelve nucleotide deletion region in the N gene of one viral strain, generates a less inhibitory effect than either si-N213 or si-N863."}
