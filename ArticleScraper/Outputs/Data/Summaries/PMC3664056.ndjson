{"summary": "in humans, there is a unique T-cell sub-population, termed V2V2 T cells (V9V2 T cells), which express T-cell receptor (TCR) comprising V2 and V2 chains. V2V2 T cells exist only in primates (both human and non-human) V2V2 TCR-dependent recognition of HMBPP and TCR-driven activation of V2V2 T cells are the only known T-cell subset capable of recognizing a microbial phosphoantigen. there appears to be no convincing evidence that T cells from mice and other species can recognize or bind HMBPP or other phospholigands. a similar specificity is observed for V2V2 TCR tetramer binding to 'endogenous' phospholigand presented on the membrane of mycobacterium-infected dendritic cells (DCs) this results suggest that HMBPP phosphoantigen activation of V2V2 T cells is TCR-dependent18. infected DCs or macrophages can rapidly present HMBPP to V2V2 TCRs, resulting in the early activation antigen-presenting cell; HMBBP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate; TB, tuberculosis; TCR, T-cell receptor. HMBPP-triggered TCR molecular responses were visualized using an innovative approach coupling near-field optical microscopy and fluorescent quantum dot nanotechnology. new findings suggest that the V2V2 TCR plays a fundamental role in the recognition of HMBPP and the subsequent activation and expansion of V2V2 T cells during infection with HMBPP-producing pathogens. the recurrence of clonotypic TCR sequences in V2V2 T cells is also evident during rapid recall expansion. additional examples of infection-driven expansion of human T cells include salmonellosis, brucellosis, legionellosis, tularemia, malaria, toxoplasmosis and leishmaniasis. the notion that human V2V2 T cells can mount an adaptive immune response during infection is further supported by other human studies. variant IL-4 (VIL-4) acts as a novel cytokine to induce the expansion of HMBPP-stimulated V2V2 T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Upon expression and purification, VIL-4 acts as a novel cytokine to induce the expansion of HMBPP-stimulated V2V2 T cells. the potent response of V2V2 T effector cells in HIV-1 infection coincides with the maintenance of latent Mtb infection in those HIV-1+ TB patients and in healthy individuals. ques with CD4+ T-cell counts 500/l were treated with HMBPP phosphoantigen and IL-2 and the expansion and effector function of V2V2 T cells was assessed. the results are consistent with the restoration of \u2018depressed' V2V2 T-cell function by antiretroviral treatment of SIVmac-infected macaques. an appreciable expansion of V2V2 T cells can be detected in macaques with primary pneumonic plague following inhalational Yersinia pestis infection (20, and data not shown) also, an appreciable expansion of V2V2 T cells can be detected in the blood and lung tissues of macaques with primary pneumonic plague following inhalational Yersinia pestis infection. this finding argues that HMBPP is responsible for the expansion of V2V2 T cells in infections with HMBPP-producing microbes. other cytokines may also contribute to the HMBPP-stimulated expansion of V2V2 T cells in infections with HMBPP-producing microbes. effector response of V2V2 T cells in latent Mtb infection is 'depressed' in chronically active tuberculosis or in the chronic phase of HIV infection. the potent response of V2V2 T cells in HIV-1 infection coincides with the maintenance of latent Mtb infection in those HIV-1+ persons whose CD4+ T-cell count is >. 'depressed' V2V2 T cells appear to undergo in vivo expansion and mount effector function in response to phosphoantigen/IL-2 treatment. previous studies have suggested that V2 or V2 T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals are susceptible to deletion or dysfunction. however, it was not known whether V2V2 T cells could maintain some degree of functional response to HMBPP phosphoantigen stimulation in vivo. clonal responses of HMBPP-specific V2V2 T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid compartments during Mtb infection Compared to T cells, T cells constitute a minor T-cell population in the total T-cell pool. approximately 90 dominant clonotypic sequences representing approximately 12 V families were detected in PPD-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in five macaques. the majority of TCR clones found in the lymphoid system, lung, kidney and liver were unique. studies of the TCR repertoire and clonal responses of the V2V2 T-cell sub-population in TB also yield interesting information. some TCR clones appear to be more dominant than others in lymphocytes from liver or kidney tissues without apparent TB lesions. the clonal dominance of expanded V2V2 T cells in kidney or liver tissues suggests that these T cells might efficiently traffic to these tissues. this notion is consistent with earlier findings that V2V2 T effector cells are able to confer homeostatic protection against Y. pestis lesions in the lung. expansion of expanded V2V2 T cells can produce anti-TB cytokines IFN-, TNF-, IL-4, IL-17 and perforin after HMBPP engagement in vitro. LM-expanded V2V2 T cells exhibit broad effector functions and produce or coproduce Th1, Th2, Th17 or cytotoxic cytokines during peak T-cell expansion. the development of T-helper subsets that produce Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines is controlled tightly by single, unique master transcriptional factors such as T-bet, GATA-3 and RORT. effector function for killing infected target cells and inhibiting intracellular Mtb or LM replication. a delayed HMBPP/IL-2 administration after inhalational Y. pestis infection overcame the acute infection. expanded V2V2 T cells failed to control extracellular Y. pestis replication and infection, leading to extrathoracic dissemination, septicemia and fatal shock. this outcome is understandable, as an extracellular bacterial infection would typically be controlled by neutralizing antibodies and not T effector cells. macaques treated with glucose plus IL-2 or glucose alone showed severe hemorrhaging and necrosis in most lung lobes. this study provides the first in vivo evidence that V2V2 T cells can contribute to antimicrobial immunity in humans and primates. it is hypothesized that the evolution of V2V2 T cells could be readily evaluated during LM infection of non-human primates. ated LM appears to mimic the immunological aspects of human systemic LM infection. expanded V2V2 T cells exhibit broad effector functions and produce IFN-, TNF-, IL-4, IL-17 and perforin. some coproducing IL-17 and IFN-, IL-4 and IFN- or TNF- and perforin. listeria-infected target cells can be directly killed by in vivo-expanded V2V2 T cells. this new finding appears to be linked to the perforin-producing effector function of V2V2 T cells. this new finding appears to be linked to the perforin-producing effector function of V2V2 T cells. a delayed HMBPP/IL-2 administration after inhalational Y. pestis infection overcame the acute infection and induced a marked expansion of V2V2 T cells. however, expanded V2V2 T cells failed to control extracellular Y. pestis replication and infection, leading to extrathoracic dissemination, septicemia and fatal shock. expansion of V2V2 T cells can antagonize Foxp3+ Tregs and overreacting proinflammatory Th22 cells Foxp3+ Treg cells control immune responses. hyperresponsive Tregs during infection may lead to the suppression of host antimicrobial immunity. activated V2V2 T cells alone did not directly depress the expansion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in culture in the absence of APCs and other PBMCs. specific cytokines produced by V2V2 T effector cells were assessed for the ability to downregulate the IL-2-induced proliferation of Tregs. in the proliferation assay, cytokines were neutralized using anti-IFN-, anti-IL-4 or anti- phosphoantigen activation/expansion of V2V2 T cells can antagonize Tregs and the Treg-associated suppression of and antimicrobial T-cell responses in infections. some T-cell subsets in the immune system can antagonize overreacting Th22 cells and Foxp3+ Tregs. the short-term increased effector function of V2V2 T cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing antimicrobial cytokines. the significance for these findings appears to be twofold: (i) HMBPP-activated V2V2 T cells may function as an adjuvant and facilitate the production of Abs by B cells. HMBPP/IL-2-expanded V2V2 T cells30,32,42 were assessed for their ability to antagonize IL-2-expanded CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells53,54,55,56 in macaques. this downregulated expansion of Tregs led to a sustained increase in the number of V2V2 T cells at 42 days following Picostim/IL-2 treatment of BCG-infected macaques. 2V2 T effector cells were assessed for the ability to downregulate the IL-2-induced proliferation of Tregs. in the proliferation assay, cytokines were neutralized using anti-IFN-, anti-IL-4 or anti-TGF- neutralizing antibodies. however, treatment with an anti-IFN- neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the ability of HMBPP-activated V2V2 T cells to antagonize Treg expansion. studies analyzing HMBPP/IL-2 treatment of macaques in the context of mycobacterial infection provide the first evidence suggesting certain T-cell subsets in the immune system can antagonize overreacting Th22 cells, Foxp3+ Tregs and the Treg-associated suppression of Ag-specific T-cell responses in infections. the significance for these findings appears to be twofold: (i) HMBPP/V2V2 T cell-based intervention may be useful for combating ne HMBPP-activated V2V2 T cells may function as an adjuvant and facilitate the production of Abs by B cells. it has been shown that the activation of human T cells can stimulate DC maturation."}
