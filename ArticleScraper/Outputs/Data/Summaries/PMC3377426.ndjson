{"summary": "early hemorrhagic smallpox had all the hallmarks of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) patients had widespread hemorrhaging in the skin during the early septic phase, usually before a rash developed. internal bleeding likely affected many organs. ocular variola was fairly common in the Asian subcontinent. severe conjunctivitis was common in patients with smallpox, and corneal lesions developed in 7% of unvaccinated patients. ocular variola major resulted in destruction of large joints in 2% of unvaccinated children. smallpox was a nosocomial disease (16,17) a patient who initially had no diagnosis was imperfectly isolated despite having a high fever. the disease was considered by many experts to be most common in caregivers. patients with smallpox virus may become severely ill if exposed to smallpox virus. iatrogenic immune suppression, and atopic dermatitis may make vaccination difficult or dangerous if exposed to smallpox virus. a modern well-equipped viral genetics laboratory would have minimal difficulties. if widespread transmission occurs of a newly created or genetically modified variola major virus, it is highly likely that it would spread to third-world nations. this likely blowback should inhibit terrorists' motivation to recreate the variola virus or enhance its pathogenicity. the manufacturer is developing a freeze-dried formulation. it requires syringes and needles and must be administered by someone trained to give injections. first-generation and second-generation vaccines are lyophilized and can be reconstituted and administered in the field. research agenda with variola major virus has been largely fulfilled (1\u20135) modern viral genetics may have rendered destruction of the 2 official remaining stores moot because the virus can be recreated with minimal technical difficulty. discussions about destruction of the remaining variola major virus stocks should not be limited to the scientific points set forth in the US Institute of Medicine report."}
