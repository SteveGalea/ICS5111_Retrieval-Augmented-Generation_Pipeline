{"summary": "the discovery of viral pathogens has been intensified in the last decades by improved molecular methods. the cost per nucleotide sequenced reduced dramatically, whereas the amount of data retrieved from a single experiment increased massively. the unbiased virus discovery amplification method used at our institute is VIDISCA, a restriction enzyme recognition based amplification technique that allows amplification of RNA or DNA sequences regardless of the genome composition. the performance of VIDISCA-454 in feces was investigated using broth suspensions from a sample-bank collected from HIV-1 infected individuals. the viral load in feces suspension ranged between 5 103 and 3 107 genome copies/mL. no extra purification methods like filtration were performed. in total 278,944 VIDISCA-454-reads were retrieved. the 178 sequences originated from 36 out of 54 samples (65%) the samples in which HIV-1 was not detected had low HIV-1 copy numbers. axis the percentage of viral sequence read: HIV-1 (blood), norovirus (stool), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, picornaviruses and influenzaviruses (respiratory material) experimental section 3.1. Clinical Samples Fecal samples were selected from a sample bank containing 56 HIV-1-infected adult patients with diarrhea, aged above 17. o-G1-P TGG ACA GGA GAT CGC and Noro-G2-P TGG GAG GAT CG were removed from 110 L feces suspension or serum by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. elution of nucleic acids was performed in sterile H2O containing 10 M of rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides. the search for viral sequences was performed with BLAST [13] on the Dutch e-Science Grid with the e-BioInfra platform. this BLAST implementation can take sequences in SFF and FASTA format and performs a search against the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide database [15] in parallel.
