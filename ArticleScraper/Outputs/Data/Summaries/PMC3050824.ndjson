{"summary": "cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most prevalent congenital viral infection in the united states and Europe. HCMV is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. current treatments for HCMV-associated diseases are insufficient due to the emergence of drug-induced resistance and cytotoxicity. peptides 264-291 and 297-315 inhibited infection by 97% and 92% at concentrations of 100 M and 50 M respectively. 67% inhibition of HCMV infection at a concentration of 0.125 M each. primary HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients causes serious disease. HCMV has a double-stranded DNA genome of 235 kb encoding approximately 165 genes. it has a very broad cellular tropism resulting in potential infection of nearly every organ system. the entry of herpesviruses into host cells is still poorly understood. gB is required for fusion of viral and cellular membranes, virus entry, and cell-to-cell spread of HCMV. HCMV infection is highly prevalent in the population due to the ability of the virus to efficiently transmit between hosts that harbour and periodically shed the virus. HCMV is transmitted through direct exposure to infected bodily secretions. current treatments for HCMV disease target viral replication and can fail due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants. antiviral therapy that inhibits viral entry may serve as an alternative to the already existing and inadequate therapeutic agents. class III domain nomenclature used here can apply to both class II and class III viral fusion proteins. s and alphaviruses contain fusion domain comprised principally of -sheets and \"fusion loops\" class III viral fusion proteins also possess a fusion domain, as well as several other features of class II viral fusion proteins. the alternative domain number schemes used by Roche et al. and Heldwein et al. are noted in parentheses. the deNV stem domain sequence that was not included in the protein used to determine the crystal structure has been added. the deNV stem has a positive WWIHS scale score. -positive sequence in the transmembrane protein (TM) of HIV-1 prevents viral fusion and entry of the virus. nine sequences with significant positive WWIHS scores were identified. the interface scale measures a residue's free energy of transfer within an unfolded polypeptide chain from water to a phosphocholine bilayer. we identified nine segments of HCMV gB that display high propensity to interact with the lipid surface of cell membrane. nine synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences with significant WWIHS scores were synthesized and examined for their ability to inhibit HCMV infection of HFF cells. amino acid sequences of HCMV gB peptides were synthesized based on the amino acid sequence determined from GenBank accession no. DAA00160 (Human Herpesvirus 5 strain AD169) the scrambled peptide (control), of peptide 233-263, was unable to inhibit HCMV infection significantly (data not shown) peptides 174-200 and 233-263 were tested together, no significant inhibitory effect was shown. representative fluorescent and bright light images of HFF cells infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) were taken 48 hours post-infection. HFF were seeded at a density of 3.5105 cells in each well of a 24-well plate 24 hours prior to infection. the inhibitory effect of peptide 233-263 was evaluated by infecting human foreskin fibroblasts. infecting human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) preincubated with different concentrations of inhibitory peptide 264-291 at 37\u00b0C for 90 minutes. GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy and then quantified using flow cytometry. FP-positive cells compared to HCMV infected cells are denoted by a * (p 0.05), ** (p 0.01), and *** (p 0.001, determined using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post test). different domains of gB are shown in the ribbon structures. different domains of gB are shown in the ribbon structures. yellow-fusion domain II, purple-stem, green-domain I, and blue-domain III. Peptides targeting different domains of HCMV gB are shown in black. peptide 233-263 inhibits infection by the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV. gB is a likely class III viral fusion protein. class III viral fusion proteins share certain characteristics found in class I or class II viral fusion proteins. class II viral fusion proteins contain a fusion domain comprised principally of -sheets and \"fusion loops\" class III viral fusion proteins also possess a fusion domain, as well as several other features of class II viral fusion proteins. the current class III viral fusion protein numbering combines two interacting domains into domain III. a class III domain nomenclature is used to apply to both class II and III viral fusions proteins. the alternative domain number schemes used by Roche et al. and Heldwein et al. are noted in parentheses. the deNV stem domain sequence that was not included in the protein used to determine the crystal structure has been added. a 36-amino acid peptide overlaps with a WWIHS score-positive sequence in the transmembrane protein (TM) of HIV-1. it prevents viral fusion and entry of the virus. nine sequences with significant positive WWIHS scores were identified. the interface scale measures a residue's free energy of transfer within an unfolded polypeptide chain from water to a phosphocholine bilayer. nine segments of HCMV gB display high propensity to interact with the lipid surface of cell membrane. nine synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences with significant WWIHS scores were synthesized and examined for their ability to inhibit HCMV infection of HFF cells. amino acid sequences of HCMV gB peptides were synthesized based on amino acid sequence determined from geneBank accession no.

HFF were seeded at a density of 3.5105 cells in each well of a 24-well plate 24 hours prior to infection. the inhibitory effect of peptide 233-263 was evaluated by infecting human foreskin fibroblasts. the inhibitory effect of peptide 264-291 was evaluated by infecting human foreskin fibroblasts with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) preincubated with different concentrations of inhibitory peptide 297-315 at 37\u00b0C for 90 minutes. GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy. orescence microscopy and then quantified using flow cytometry. significant reductions in the number of GFP-positive cells compared to HCMV infected cells are denoted by a * (p 0.05), ** (p 0.01), and *** (p 0.001, determined using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post test). all structural figures of HSV-1 gB in the post-fusion configuration were generated using MacPyMOL [56] and FreeHand (Macromedia). different domains of gB are shown in the ribbon structures: yellow-fusion domain II, purple-stem, green-domain I, and blue-domain III with extended -helices. green-domain I, blue-domain III with extended helices are involved in trimerization. peptide 233-263 inhibits infection by the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV. peptide 233-263 infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI) seven out of 138 15-mer peptides inhibited infection by more than 50% at a concentration of 100 M. three peptides (gB131, gB122 and gB94) with 50% effective concentrations below 20 M were studied further. the most potential inhibitors of HCMV infection were all in domain II. the most potential inhibitors of HCMV infection were all in domain II. the most potent inhibitors of HCMV infection are all in domain II (174-200, 233-263, 264-291, 297-315) the effects of several of the HCMV inhibitory peptides did not follow a linear dose-dependent inhibition curve. mivirsen have been approved for the treatment of HCMV-associated disease. all of these drugs, with exception of fomivirsen, have a common target, the viral DNA polymerase. new drugs that are more efficacious and are not toxic are urgently needed. s are effective at preventing HCMV infection. those lead peptides will be studied further and modified to increase their efficacy, solubility and delivery. currently available drugs to treat HCMV infection are not approved to treat pregnant women due to their potential high toxicity. stock solutions were prepared in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, spectroscopy grade): 90% (v/v) H2O. peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance of aromatic side chains at 280 nm. Flow Cytometry HFF cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1% FBS DPBS. HCMV gB synthetic peptides were synthesized by conventional chemistry by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA) indulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and GlutaMAX (2 mM) the authors declare that they have no competing interests.
