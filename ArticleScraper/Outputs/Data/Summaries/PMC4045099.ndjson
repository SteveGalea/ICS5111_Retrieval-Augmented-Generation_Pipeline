{"summary": "a decade ago, we published several articles that described our definitions of healing and of healing-oriented practice and environments (HOPE) and how they are organized to create an optimal healing environment (OHE) as they apply to healthcare. in the ensuing years, the accumulation of scientific evidence and the changes in healthcare delivery brought on by health reform have reinforced the importance of an OHE. salutogenesis is a psychological construct and a stress-buffering resource. the concept goes beyond the original psychological construct to form the foundation for a model of medical care built on health creation. salutogenesis is a framework for the application of salutogenesis in healthcare settings. it can be used to map and leverage many other models seeking to move from disease care to health creation. it is an organizing concept or heuristic framework that is applicable to all health professionals, patients and their families. pillars of human flourishing create the framework for understanding an OHE10. these pillars facilitate human flourishing via the emergence of the optimal level of human functioning under any circumstances. each of these domains is relevant across the full spectrum of our lifespan and generations. a person with a chronic disease has a low expectation that healing can take place. the evidence for the impact of intention and expectation on health outcomes is most apparent in the placebo literature. an OHE includes techniques for self-care and mind-body-energy practices. healing relationships are defined as \u201cthe connections and interactions between persons who hold an intention for healing and well-being to occur\u201d they are intentional and covenantal in nature, are grounded in trust, involve both positive and authentic emotional engagement, and are mutually beneficial. an OHE enhances social support systems by creating spaces that allow family participation in care and models of care that are patient- and family-centered. connecting the clinical and non-clinical spaces is another aspect of healing relationships that relates to the patient's family and close friends. the elements of a healthy lifestyle are well known and include healthy eating, regular exercise, stress management and relaxation techniques. it also includes attention to managing negative behaviors and addictions as to alcohol and tobacco, unhealthy sexual behavior, and violence. techniques to accomplish this include access to individual and group health and nutrition educational programs. healing spaces provide access to nature and use music, art, color, and aroma (and odor control) to invoke the relaxation response and set a positive tone. skillful use of technology to decrease noise is critical to protecting circadian rhythms. designs that optimize activity and exposure to nature include healing gardens and walking paths. healing research is a relatively immature field just now coming into its own. there are questions about the availability of supporting evidence-based data. there is a lack of consensus of what defines and constitutes integrative medicine. there is a lack of consensus of what defines and constitutes integrative medicine. the Affordable Care Act often leaves major questions about if and how healing behaviors will be covered in benefits and where along the spectrum of care they will be supported. aging is inevitably associated with chronic health conditions and disabilities. cost/Cost-avoidance Inner Environment Mindfulness Meditation Improved patient self-reported
