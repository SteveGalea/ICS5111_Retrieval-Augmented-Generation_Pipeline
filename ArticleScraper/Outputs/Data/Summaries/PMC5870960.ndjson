{"summary": "genetic code has degenerate feature that a single amino acid, except methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp), is encoded by more than one codon known as synonymous codons. the synonymous codons are not used at equal frequencies in coding sequences in many organisms [1]. the genus Gossypium includes around 46 diploid (2n = 2x = 26) and 6 tetraploid (2n = 4x = 52) and 1 purported species [24\u201326], including four commercial ones, G. arboreum (A2), G. herbaceum (A1), G. hirsutum (AD1) and G. barbadense (AD2) i [30], G. arboreum [31], G. hirsutum [33] and G. barbadense [34] were downloaded from the CottonGen database. we separated the two allotetraploids into At and Dt subgenomes using Seqkit [39] (https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) stop codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA) were also excluded from the analysis because each stop codon can only occur once in a single CDS sequence. a number of indices of codon usage bias including the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC) and frequency of the nucleotides G+C at the third position were also counted. PR2-bias plots are particularly informative when PR2 biases at the third codon position are plotted. the center of the plot, where both coordinates are 0.5, is the place where A = T and G = C (PR2). the degree of deviation from PR2 allows us to estimate the chain bias affected by mutation, selection, or both. the expected ENC values from GC3s were calculated according to the equation given by Wright [42] and Novembre [43]. the genes would be distributed along the standard curve or near the standard curve when codon bias is only affected by mutation. they would fall below the standard curve if codon bias is only affected by mutation. the RSCU values of the codons from the two databases were compared. if the difference (RSCU) is equal to or greater than 0.08, codons with a frequency of usage that was significantly higher (P 0.01) in high-bias genes were defined as the optimal codons [22,48]. SPSS V21.0 was implemented for statistical analysis. at1 and Dt1 in G. hirsutum, and At2 and Dt2 in g. barbadense respectively. the number of CDSs and codons of 4 cotton species and 4 subgenomes used in this study. the G+C content at the first, second positions of codons were also counted. the average GC content of the first and second positions was determined by the online Cusp program from Galaxy. the correlations between nucleotide contents were calculated by codonW 1.4.2. the A3s/(A3s+T3s) and G3s/(G3s+C3s) of each gene were calculated and used as the ordinate and the abscissa to show the relationship between the two base contents of genes. the PR2-plots were drawn by Matlab R2016a (http://www.mathworks.com/) the effective codon number (ENC) determines the degree of preference for the unbalanced use of codons the results of PR2-bias plot can reflect the relationship between purine (A and G) and pyrimidine (T and C) in codon composition. P2 was calculated according to the following equation, where W = A or U, S = C or G, and Y = C or U. 4 cotton species and 4 At- and Dt- subgenomes were clustered according to their RSCU values using the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis tool. each cotton species was used as an object, and the relative use of codon was taken as variable. stop codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA) were also excluded from the analysis because each stop codon can only occur once in a single CDS sequence. the average value of all the genes was expressed in T3s(av), G3s(av), GC(av) and ENC(av) multiple comparisons across the cotton species and subgenomes were made by SPSS V21.0. PR2-bias plot Parity Rule 2 (PR2) is a rule of DNA composition. the effective codon number (ENC) determines the degree of preference for the unbalanced use of codons. ENC value ranges from 20 (only one codon is used for each amino acid) to 61 (when all synonymous codons are used for each amino acid) highly expressed genes have a large degree of codon preference. low expression genes contain more rare codons and have a larger ENC value. the relative level of gene expression is currently generally determined by comparing ENCs. codon usage parameters were calculated for each cotton species and subgenome taking all their CDSs as whole. the base composition at the third codon position conforms to T > A > G > C. both the GC3s and GC content were less than 0.5. the effective codon number (ENC) values revealed the degree of CUB. ENC values less than 35 mean high codon preference and ENC values more than 50 reveal general random codon usage. av, GC(av) and ENC(av) of genes in 4 species and 4 subgenomes and their multiple comparisons. the \u201c(av)\u201d represents the average of all genes. four species genomes showed significant differences in T3s(av), G3s(av) and ENC(av) significant differences were found between G. raimondii and other three species, between G. arboreum and G. barbadense. no significant difference was detected between the two tetraploids, and between G. aboreum and G. hirsutum. significant differences were not detected only in GC(av) between At2 and Dt2 subgenomes. the higher the gene expression level is, the stronger is the preferred use of codon [1\u20133,6,15,16,49,55\u201360]. GC12 represents the average GC content of the first and second positions of the codons. mutational stress is superior to translation selection in the formation of codon usage bias. a significant correlation between GC12 and GC3 values means that translation selection plays dominant role in codon usage preference. a slightly more number of genes of G. arboreum, G. barbadense and its two subgenomes distributed on the G > C side than the G C side. nearly equal amount of genes of G. raimondii, G. hirsutum and its two subgenomes distributed on both sides. a majority of genes with low ENC values deviated well below expected curve. RSCU values analysis and determination of putative optimal codons were calculated and shown in S2 Table. the RSCU values of CDSs in 4 cotton species and 4 subgenomes were greater than 1 and 31 codons were smaller than 1 in all the cotton species, except AAG (Gly), GUG (Gly) and AAA (Lys) raimondii G. hirsutum G. barbadense At1 Dt1 At2 Dt2 High Low High Low High Low High Low High Low High Low High

detected in chloroplast genome [36] and nuclear genome in G. hirsutum herein was 23 and 26 respectively, with 12 shared optimal codons. most of the rest 11 optimal codons specifically determined in chloroplast genome ended with C (7 of 11), while most of the rest 14 optimal codons specifically determined in nuclear genome end with U (8 of 14). if the first two bases are both A or U, the third base of \"right choice\" is U because C gives a strong binding energy. the values of WWC, SSC, WWU, SSU and P2 in 4 cotton species and 4 subgenomes are inconsistent with the widely accepted taxonomic and phylogenetic relationship of these four cotton species. the two tetraploids G. hirsutum and G. barbadense were grouped into two different clusters. the monophyly of polyploid Gossypium species was also studied through cluster analysis based on sequences of a 2.8-kb intergenic region from all diploid species. all the At subgenomes and the A1 and A2 genomes were grouped into one cluster, and all the At subgenomes and the A1 and A2 genomes were grouped into another cluster. the results of the present study indicated that the evolutionary relationship between these four cotton species could not be well Species and subgenomes T3s A3s G3s GC ENC G. arboreum 0.425 0.341 0.262 0.230 0.381 0.437 54.08 G. raimondii 0.437 0.344 0.259 0.220 0.370 0.434 53.39 G. hirsutum 0.425 0.341 0.262 0.232 0.382

T3s, GC, GC(av) and ENC(av) of genes in 4 species and 4 subgenomes and their multiple comparisons. the \u201c(av)\u201d represents the average of all genes. the four species genomes showed significant differences in T3s(av), G3s(av) and ENC(av) no significant differences were found between At and Dt subgenomes in G. hirsutum or G. barbadense. significant differences were detected only in GC(av) between At1 and Dt1 subgenomes. the results indicated that the base content at the third position of the synonymous codons directly affects the degree of codon usage preference. it could be concluded that genes with stronger codon usage bias (with lower ENC value) would have lower G3s, C3s and higher T3s values. the digits before and after backslash represent correlation coefficient among 4 cotton species and 4 subgenomes. the PR2-bias plots of the four cotton species and four subgenomes were shown in Fig 3. a majority of genes with low ENC values deviated well below the expected curve. the RSCU values of 25 codons were greater than 1 and 31 codons were smaller than 1 in all the cotton species, except AAG (Gly), GUG (Gly) and AAA (Lys) 19 to 26 optimal codons were determined for each cotton species. 15 of them ending with T, 9 ending with A, 2 ending with G. codons with T at the third position were detected more frequently. 1.86 1.39**** 1.86 1.3**** 1.88 1.39**** 1.85 1.4****

most of the rest 11 optimal codons specifically determined in chloroplast genome ended with C (7 of 11) while most of the rest 14 optimal codons specifically determined in nuclear genome end with U (8 of 14). the values of WWC, SSC, WWU and SSU were calculated according to the RSCU values of the corresponding codons. both SSU and WWU were higher than SSC and WWC in all species and subgenomes, especially in G. raimondii with the largest SSU and WWU and the lowest SSC and WWC. the choice between two pyrimidines in the third position of codon tends to U. these results are inconsistent with the widely accepted taxonomic and phylogenetic relationship of these four cotton species [24,26,28,67\u201370]. the allopolyploid cotton species may have appeared through hybridization and subsequent polyploidization events between the A- and D-subgenome progenitors. codon composition analysis revealed these species and subgenomes had low GC and GC3, tended to use pyrimidine-rich codons more frequently than purine-rich codons at the third positions of codons. the base content at the third position of codons affected the degree of codon preference.
