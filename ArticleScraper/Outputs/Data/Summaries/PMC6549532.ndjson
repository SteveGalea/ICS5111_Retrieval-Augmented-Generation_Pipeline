{"summary": "immune system includes innate or nonspecific immunity as well as adaptive or specific immunity. response of an organism to different pathological conditions is an innate, non-specific response. inflammatory mediators are produced by leukocytes, endothelial cells, tissue cells or are derived from plasma proteins. acute phase response (APR) occurs shortly after tissue damage due to several conditions such as infection, trauma, neoplasia, inflammation, and stress. the reaction of APR includes systemic consequences, such as fever, leucocytosis, increased release of several hormones and drastic rearrangement of plasma protein synthesis (6). major, moderate, and minor positive APPs usually have a marked increase within 48 h after a pathogen stimulus and a subsequent rapid decline after the cessation of stimulus due to their short half-life. however, the APPs response varies between species: the major APP in dogs and men is C-reactive protein (CRP) (13), in cats is 1\u2013acid glycoprotein (AGP) (9), in ruminants is Haptoglobin (14), in horse is marine mammals are a group of around 130 mammalian species. they include 3 orders: Carnivora (pinnipeds, otters, and polar bear), Cetacea (dolphins, whale, and porpoise) and Sirenia (manatee and dugogons) adaptation caused few differences in distribution and function of immune system between marine and terrestrial mammals. several assays were proposed to evaluate both immune response in marine mammals. the phagocytosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were investigated. in vitro ingestion of latex beads and hydrogen peroxide production have been evaluated in beluga whales and bottlenose dolphins. an IL-2 receptor expression assay and an IL-6 ELISA were developed in bottlenose dolphins and killer whales respectively. phagocytosis increased with age in gray and harbor seal pups, while in female harbor seal pups decreased from sub-adult to adulthood. first parameters tested were WBC and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (39) however, even if they are inexpensive and rapid, they lack specificity and sensitivity. efforts were directed to identify inflammation at earlier stage (40) albumin acts as a negative acute phase protein since the synthesis of this protein is decreased during an inflammation (47). the lower concentration of positive APPs associated to a higher concentration of albumin and the consequent higher albumin/globulins ratio could reflect lower antigenic stimuli in managed population compared to the free-ranging populations (36). the only clinical significance of these alteration was a higher ability to detect chronic inflammation for Hp. the only clinical significance of these alteration was a higher ability to detect chronic inflammation for Hp. s Binds hemoglobin dimers so that iron is not available to organisms; bacteriostatic effect; role in lipid metabolism; immunomodulatory effect; inhibition of neutrophil respiratory burst activity Positive COW, PIG Bottlenose dolphin; Harbor porpoise; Harbor seal; Stellar sea lion; Ringed seal. five different APPs were tested: AGP, CRP, Hp, fibrinogen, and SAA. SAA showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (90% for both sensitivity and specificity) the diagnostic specificity of Hp and fibrinogen were 93 and 95%, respectively. APPs have longer stability compared to other blood component such as WBC. they can be performed on frozen serum, thus the samples can be shipped to references laboratories. understanding of genetic, phenotypical and biochemical properties of marine mammals APPs are essential prior to using them as a new biomarker. a phylogenetic study has identified a PON1 functional loss in marine mammals. this is due to adaptation to the marine environment and fatty acid oxidation. enzymatic activity against other PON1 substrates is still present, such as arylesterase activity (69). the use of a novel biomarker required a full evaluation of all the analytical performances and the clinical value. in veterinary medicine, the validation studies do not always follow all these steps, mainly due to the lack of resources or technical limitation (44, 65) compared to human and companion animals, the use of APPs in marine mammals is just getting started. the increasing need of knowledge on immune system and its response against infectious diseases or chemical pollutants have increased the effort of researchers to study the APR and APPs. author contributions MG and FB analyzed literature review, designed, and wrote review. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
