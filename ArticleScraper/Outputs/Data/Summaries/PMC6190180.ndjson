{"summary": "medical history included keratoconjunctivitis sicca and presumptive dietary allergies managed with ophthalmic cyclosporine. a complete blood (cell) count (CBC) and serum biochemistry showed decreased T4 [6.44 nmol/L; reference range (RR): 10.3 to 45 nmol/L] the patient\u2019s temperature was 39.5\u00b0C and respiratory rate was 110 breaths/min (bpm) with mild to moderate dyspnea. thoracic auscultation revealed normal bronchovesicular sounds. the dog was hospitalized with oxygen supplementation FiO2 0.40, ampicillin/sulbactam (AuroMedics Pharma, Dayton, New Jersey, USA), enrofloxacin, Plasma-lyte A (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA), mirtazapine, and nebulization/coupage. the respiratory rate on day 2 transiently decreased to 60 bpm and body temperature was 38.9\u00b0C. anesthesia was maintained with midazolam (Hospira), 0.5 mg/kg BW per hour and propofol (Zoetis), 15 mg/kg BW per hour, IV. it was confirmed propofol with benzyl alcohol was not used in this patient. arterial blood gas evaluation 2 h after induction revealed a moderate acidemia. 7.3 6.0 5.9 1.8 1.5 3.4 THb 133 to 205 g/L 117 115 100 O2Hb 84.4% 91.8% 96.0% COHb 1% 1.6% 2.4% 1.7% MetHb 1% 13.1% 4.9% 1.5% HHb 0.9% 0.8% 0.8% tBili 1.7 to 5.1 mol/L 8.5 126.6 145.4 Na+ 140 to 150 mmol/L 143.6 145.5 144.5 144.5 methemoglobinemia 13.1% (reference value: 1%) (10). propofol was discontinued and anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (Fentanyl; West-Ward, Eatontown, New Jersey, USA) a previously submitted test for leptospirosis by polymerase chain reaction was negative in blood and urine. the respiratory PCR panel was positive for parainfluenza but negative for canine influenza (H3N8), canine adenovirus type 2, canine respiratory coronavirus, influenzas H1N1 and H5N1. liver enzymes remained elevated at 6593 IU/L. bilirubin was 83.8 mol/L. dog was discharged from the hospital. propofol is structurally similar to co-enzyme Q, which is integral to movement of electrons from complexes I and II to complex III in the electron transport chain (13). propofol inhibits flux of electrons along the electron transport chain, but only uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation at very high doses. MCFA \u2014 medium chain fatty acid; MM \u2014 mitochondrial matrix; NADH \u2014 reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; OMM \u2014 outer mitochondrial membrane; Pi \u2014 inorganic phosphate; SCFA \u2014 short-chain fatty acid; tricarboxylic acid cycle. catecholamines have been documented to cause myofibrillar degeneration in humans. catecholamines increase cardiac output thereby decreasing plasma levels of propofol necessitating higher propofol rates. glucocorticoids also contribute to rhabdomyolysis seen in PRIS. hypotension could be attributed to alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors and calcium channel proteins. propofol sensitizes the heart to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias. hypoglycemia may have been a result of hepatic insufficiency or sepsis. hypoglycemia may have been a result of hepatic insufficiency or sepsis. hepatic cholestasis secondary to liver damage or sepsis. methemoglobinemia leads to decreased arterial oxygen content. methemoglobin levels between 10% and 20% may be tolerated well. dyspnea and tachycardia develop once methemoglobin reaches 30%. an abstract was published evaluating the effects of NAC in a rat model of PRIS. it showed that when NAC was administered concurrently with propofol, it reduced acidosis, AST, ALT, LDH, troponin-I, lactate, and inflammation and necrosis of hepatocytes in comparison to propofol infusion alone."}
