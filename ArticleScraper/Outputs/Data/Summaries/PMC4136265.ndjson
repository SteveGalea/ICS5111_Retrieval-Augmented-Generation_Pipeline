{"summary": "subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) of coronaviruses are both (i) 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 coterminal with the genome for at least 70 and 1,670 nucleotides (nt) they are present in sgmRNA-length replication-intermediate-like double-stranded RNA structures that are involved in sgmRNA synthesis (4\u20136) but fail to replicate when transfected into virus-infected cells. the viral genome is envisioned as the only template for negative ()-strand RNA synthesis. in this model, the sgmRNA-length ()-strand RNA (5, 12, 13) then functions as a template for synthesis of new sgmRNA. in this model, the sgmRNA-length ()-strand RNA (5, 12, 13) then functions as a template for synthesis. sgmRNAs of smaller size are generated from this site in a manner consistent with the Sawicki model. this behavior suggests a mechanism of sgmRNA amplification by a cascading transcription process and not by replication (16) why do the sgmRNAs, the shortest of which is 1.8 kb in length in the mouse and bovine coronaviruses, not replicate following transfection as RNA transcripts into helper virus-infected cells the naturally occurring DI RNA was shortened from its 3\u2032 end to 322 nt. sgmRNA7 RNA (as represented by transcripts of pDrep1-WT) was cotransfected into BCoV-infected cells. the sgmRNA7 does not replicate after transfection into helper virus-infected cells. a similar region of the virus genome is found in all naturally occurring coronavirus DI RNAs described to date. within the 420-nt 5\u2032-proximal region of the naturally occurring BCoV DI RNA, the 65-nt common leader plus a 3\u2032-ward extension of 9 nt (making 74 nt total) are found in common between the replicating wild-type (WT) DI RNA and the nonreplicating sgmRNA7. mfold-predicted RNA structures at the 5\u2032-proximal 322 nt of the BCoV DI RNA and its ()-strand counterpart. structures in the (+) strand are stem-loops 1 through 8. previously described long-range RNA-RNA interaction between a region within the 5\u2032 UTR (nt 143 through 170) and the 5\u2032-terminal nsp1-coding region (nt 335 through 364) is shown in the 102-nt sequence (397 through 498) removed from the 3\u2032 end of the partial nsp1-coding sequence in pDrep1-WT to form the minimalized pDrep1-397-498 (26). the nsp1 fusion site is between A494 in the nsp1-coding sequence and A495, the fourth nucleotide upstream of the N start codon in the genome. stem-loops 1, 2, and 3 were formerly named stem-loops I and II. stem-loops 4 through 8 were formerly named stem-loops III through VII. the status for stem-loops downstream of stem-loop 4 is less clear. the cis-translation requirement and the long-range RNA-RNA interaction have been reported for the MHV DI RNA (24, 40) the nsp1 in coronaviruses has been shown to be a multifunctional protein with RNA binding properties and features that regulate replication, interferon-dependent signaling, host cell mRNA stability and pathogenesis. the protein product of the 5\u2032-proximal partial nsp1 functions to direct the translating DI RNA genome to a still poorly defined position within the replication compartment where viral enzymes required for RNA replication reside. pDrep1 is a pGEM3Zf() (Promega)-based plasmid containing the cDNA clone of a naturally occurring 2.2-kb DI RNA of BCoV modified to carry a 30-nt in sites within the pGEM3Zf() vector and pDrep1 DNA were used. mutations in the final constructs were confirmed by sequencing. the sequence for primer GEM3Zf() is 5\u2032-GAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGT-3\u2032. -mm dish were infected with BCoV at a multiplicity of 10 PFU per cell and transfected 1 h later with 300 ng of capped RNA, using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) total RNA (approximately 10 g per plate) was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored as an ethanol precipitate. RT-PCR and sequence analysis were carried out as previously described (26). RNAs extracted from VP1- and VP2-infected cells were used for cDNA synthesis. PCR was carried out using primers TGEV-8(+) and leader() (5\u2032-GAGCGATTTGCGTGCATCCCGC-3\u2032) stock of the Mebus strain of BCoV was used as a helper virus. the human rectal-tumor cell line HRT-18 (53) was used in all experiments. pDrep1 is a pGEM3Zf()-based plasmid containing the cDNA clone of a naturally occurring 2.2-kb DI RNA of BCoV modified to carry a 30-nt in-frame reporter. 1 g of MluI-linearized DNA was used with a T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) the reaction mix was incubated with 5 U of Turbo DNase (Ambion) and RNA was quantitated by nanodrop spectrophotometry. in vitro-synthesized RNAs were used for transfection in the replication assays. supernatant fluids were harvested at 48 h postinfection (hpi) 500 l was used to infect freshly confluent cells (2.0 106) in a 35-mm dish (27) from which RNA was extracted at 48 hpi. RNA was transferred to Nytran membranes by vacuum blotting. PCR was carried out using primers TGEV-8(+) and leader() (5\u2032-GAGCGATTTGCGTGCGTGCATCCCGC-3\u2032), and the PCR product was sequenced directly. 100 ng of transcript was translated for 1 h at 30\u00b0C in a 25-l reaction mixture containing 12.5 l wheat germ extract (Promega) and 60 mM potassium acetate as recommended by the manufacturer. interacting domain between the 5\u2032 UTR and the partial nsp1-coding region (38) would act separately as a higher-order cis-acting feature for DI RNA replication. the mfold program predicts the (+)-strand and separately the ()-strand RNAs in this region to be folded as depicted in Fig. 2A were they to exist as single-stranded molecules. transcripts of pDrep1-WT have a half-life of less than 2 h (39) for constructs that replicate, sequences of the intracellular DI RNA were determined with the use of reporter-specific primers to identify potential reversion to the WT sequence. mutations A167G and C165U retain base pairing in the (+) strand (i.e., G-U and U-G, respectively) but diminish base pairing in the () strand (i. reformed base pairing in both the (+) and () strands. replication returned to near WT levels. we cannot currently rule out that stem-loop 7 has a regulatory role in DI RNA replication. base pairing in both the (+) and () strands is important for DI RNA replication. mutations U152C, U149C, G147A, and U144C would diminish base pairing in the (+) strand (i.e., C A, C A, A C, and C A, respectively) however, sequencing revealed that these molecules had reverted to the WT sequence. replication was as robust as for the WT (compare lanes 10 and 1 in Fig. 4B) the results suggest that replication is the most robust when there is base pairing in both the (+) and () strands of all three sections of the long-range RNA-RNA base-paired structure but that base pairing is required in the (+) strand. there is potential for a stem-loop 8 at the base of the lower panel that would not coexist with the long-range RNA-RNA interaction frame shifting mutations designed to change the amino acid content of regions while maintaining predicted native RNA structure. we used point mutations to test the requirement for a phylogenetically conserved NH2-proximal WAPEFPWM amino acid sequence that corresponds to the required region identified by the frameshift and truncation experiments. 393 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M6 A224G/A227C/U229A Changes amino acids NKY to STN in M3 background M7 A217 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M8 A217/+U222 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M9 A217/+C251 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M12 A217/+A464 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M13 A227/+A234 Frameshift mutation and produces U189 to base pair with A in 211UAG in WT background; M27 is background for M29, M31, and M33 M28 U177A/G178C/C222G/A223U Changes 220AUC to 220AUG. and produces U177A to base pair with A223U and G178C to base pair with C222G in WT background. FP in WT background M41 A255G/A258G/A264G Keeps PEFP but changes codons for underlined amino acids to CCG, GAG, and CCG respectively. all frameshifted mutants except for those with changed NH2-terminal amino acids 3 through 7 showed no evidence of replication. the block in replication could mean (i) that cis-acting RNA replication signals were disrupted by mutagenesis. nsp1 amino acids 3 through 7 can be changed from WT without blocking replication. nsp1 amino acids 3 through 7 can be changed from nsp1 without blocking DI RNA replication. nsp1 amino acids 3 through 7 can be changed from WT without blocking replication. nt 211 left in place, and comparisons were made with WT, M28, M30, and M32. whereas the inserted AUG codon at amino acid position 4 led to replication, the AUG codon inserted at amino acid position 20 in M27, position 22 in M31, and position 27 in M33 did not. failed translation in vivo is not a likely explanation for blockage in replication. a direct comparison of the 62 amino acids in the partial nsp1 shows little sequence conservation. upstream of amino acid 13, 6 of 12 amino acids (50%) differ. downstream of amino acid 20, 24 of 42 amino acids (57%) differ. ing codons suggest that there is an evolutionary pressure to keep the WAPEFPWM sequence. point mutations that change amino acids within the WAPEFPWM domain block DI RNA replication. mutations that change the codons but keep the WT amino acids enable replication. group A lineage betacoronaviruses encode the WAPEFPWM domain. red letters identify nucleotides or amino acids that differ from those in WT BCoV. mutations that disrupt the WAPEFPWM domain block DI RNA replication. virus [HEV], equine coronavirus [ECoV], rabbit coronavirus [RbCoV], and human coronavirus HKU1 (HKU1) species share the entire 8-amino-acid sequence (WAPEFPWM) the sequence in the more distantly related HKU1 virus (66) differs at amino acid positions 18 and 20 (WAPEFRWL) to test whether the WAPEFPWM is a necessary sequence for replication of DI RNA. western blotting assay showed incomplete translation in vivo was not likely to be the cause of replication failure in mutants M34 through M38 and M40. at least the four central amino acids within the 8-amino-acid sequence are important for the cis-acting translation function for replication. cDNA-cloned original WT (i.e., nonminimalized) DI RNA with the reporter sequence (WT pDrep1) (7) for mutation analyses. sets of translationally silent mutations were made within the long-range stem that map within three regions of the ascending and descending locations. the extended length 3\u2032-ward increased the number of potential frameshifting options. replication of the DI RNA requires a long-range RNA-RNA interaction in the positive strand. mutations A167G and C165U retain base pairing in the (+) strand (i.e., G-U and U-G, respectively) but retain base pairing in the () strand (i.e., C A and A C, respectively) replication was nearly as robust as for the WT. stem-loop 7 has a regulatory role in DI RNA replication. mutations C158U and C155U would retain base pairing in the (+) strand (i.e., U-G and U-G, respectively) but diminish base pairing in the () strand (i.e., A C and A, respectively) mutations U152C, U149C, G147A, and U144C would diminish base pairing in the (+) strand (i.e., C A, C A, A C, and C A, respectively) but retain base pairing in the () strand (i.e., G-U, G-U, U-G, and G-U, respectively) this change appeared to allow weak replication (compare lanes 8 and 1 in Fig. 4B) there is potential for a stem-loop 8 at the base of the lower panel that would not coexist with the long-range RNA-RNA interaction. there is no experimental evidence for this stem-loop, but we note that it may be playing a role in replication. evidence for a cis-acting replication signal associated with the NH2-proximal WAPEFPWM amino acid domain within the partial nsp1 was previously reported. pDrep1 mutants used in the study Wild type or mutant Mutation(s)a Comments WT is background for M1, M2, M2, M3, M27, M28, M30, M32, and M34 through 41 M1 A217/+U222 Frameshift mutation in WT background M3 A227/+A234 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M5 +[CU]222/A392/393 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M8 A217/+ 10 A217/+C305 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M11 A217/+U379 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M12 A217/+A464 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M13 A227 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M14 A227/+A234 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M16 A227/+C305 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M18 G233/+C305 Frameshift mutation in M3 background M21 G3 M29 U177A/G178C/C222G/A223U Changes 220AUC to 220AUG and produces U177A to base pair with A223U and G178C to base pair with C222G in M27 background M30 U271A/G274A/A275U/A278U Changes 274GAG to 274AUG. U271A and A278U strengthen Kozak context in M27 background M32 A290U the results are shown in Fig. 5A and B, and the results are shown in Fig. 5B and C. all frameshifted mutants except for those with changed NH2-terminal amino acids 3 through 7 showed no evidence of replication. the block in replication could mean that cis-acting RNA replication signals were disrupted by mutagenesis. both the fusion protein synthesized from DI RNA and that from N mRNA were identified by Western blotting with N-specific antibody. a second mutational approach that was less likely to alter RNA structure was used to test for the importance of amino acids 8 through 14. translation and Western blot analysis of transcripts with an N-specific antibody indicated translation was not blocked. failed translation in vivo is not a likely explanation for blockage in replication. nsp1 amino acids at positions 5 through 20 are required for DI RNA replication. p1 between BCoV and MHV shows little sequence conservation. upstream of amino acid 13, 6 of 12 amino acids (50%) differ. downstream of amino acid 20, 24 of 42 amino acids (57%) differ. the first 62 amino acids in nsp1 among 10 different group A lineage betacoronaviruses reveals a conserved WAPEFPWM domain. all eight viruses from this group supported replication of the BCoV WT DI RNA (63) human coronavirus strain HKU1 encodes a similar domain but with an R and L at amino acid positions 18 and 20 respectively. northern blot analyses show DI RNA abundances at various times posttransfection; analyses for 18S rRNA abundances serve as loading controls. virus species 1 viruses and the MHV species share the entire 8-amino-acid sequence (WAPEFPWM) the sequence in the more distantly related HKU1 virus (66) differs at amino acid positions 18 and 20 (WAPEFRWL) to test whether the WAPEFPWM is a necessary sequence for replication of DI RNA, we altered the central four amino acids by changing codons predicted to retain the same base-pairing pattern in the RNA secondary structure. this is the first description of a cis-acting translation product in the 5\u2032-proximal region of coronavirus nsp1. this is the first description of a cis-acting translation product in the 5\u2032-proximal region of coronavirus nsp1 of which at least the central four amino acids are critical for DI RNA replication. DI RNA replication correlates with the 30-nt core of the long-range higher-order RNA structure in the (+) strand (nt 143 through 170 base-paired with nt 335 through 364) but not in the () strand (shaded in the lower part of Fig. 2A) the structure contributes key steps for the initiation of new (+)-strand RNA from the 3\u2032 end of the ()-strand template. it could facilitate initiation of (+)-strand synthesis at the 3\u2032 end of the completed genomic ()-strand template. it would mimic aspects of the (+)-strand 5\u2032-end promoter described for poliovirus (74) in which RNA structures engage different components of the polymerase complex. functioning as an acceptor site would require that the higher-order RNA structure include much of the very 5\u2032 end of the genome which harbors the leader (7). the structures at the 5\u2032 end enabling it to function as an acceptor template are the same as those that would enable it to function as a donor template. the higher-order structure might also be involved in an experimentally induced positive-to-negative-strand template switch of the RdRp that takes place in this region of the genome (76) in the first study, a naturally occurring DI RNA of MHV-A59 with a long ORF consisting of an in-frame fusion of a 5\u2032-terminal portion of ORF 1a (3,680 nt), a partial ORF 1b, and a partial N ORF replicated even after frameshifting point mutations had severely truncated the fused ORF. all mutants replicated, but in each the 5\u2032-terminal WAPEFP MHV DI RNAs but not found in the BCoV DI RNA (39) facilitate an alternate access to the replication compartment. the requirement for the WAPEFPWM domain in cis for DI RNA replication may have implications for genome replication. cis-acting replication elements for DI RNA are not always the same for the viral genome. it is probable that cis-acting RNA structures in the DI RNA are recruited to the replication complexes through interaction with the viral replicase proteins. however, one possibility is that the cis-acting WAPEFPWM element is a signal to engage some component of the membrane-associated viral replicase. the target for the WAPEFPWM domain is unknown at this time. a cursory search for a sequence analogous to the WAPEFPWM domain in other coronavirus groups has not revealed such a site. higher-order RNA structure in the (+) strand is found in molecules that replicate (the genome and DI RNA) and not in molecules that fail to replicate (the sgmRNAs) a simple view is that this structure contributes key steps for initiation of new (+)-strand RNA from the 3\u2032 end of the ()-strand template. it would mimic aspects of the (+)-strand 5\u2032-end promoter described for poliovirus (74) in which RNA structures engage different components of the polymerase complex. it could facilitate the RdRp template switching at the 5\u2032 end of the genome by functioning as the donor template (UCUAAAAC) during use of an alternate pathway for genome replication (75, 78) long-range higher-order RNA structure might also be a packaging signal for the DI RNA. packaging signal nearly equivalent to 5\u2032-terminal 396-nt region studied here. no time during the current study was replication observed in absence of packaging. fusion of a 5\u2032-terminal portion of ORF 1a (3,680 nt), a partial ORF 1b, and a partial N ORF replicated even after frameshifting point mutations had severely truncated the fused ORF. all mutants replicated, but in each the 5\u2032-terminal WAPEFPWM domain was intact and therefore could have enabled replication as observed in the current study. cis-acting replication elements for DI RNA are not always the same for the viral genome. if the WAPEFPWM domain does function in the genome, it would likely not interact with a replicase protein as postulated for the DI RNA. if the WAPEFPWM domain does function in the genome, it would likely not interact with a replicase protein as postulated for the DI RNA. cis-acting RNA structures in the DI RNA are recruited to the replication complexes through interaction with the viral replicase proteins (73). the cis-acting WAPEFPWM element is a signal to engage some component of the membrane-associated viral replicase. the NH2-terminal region of the coronavirus nsp1 contained within the first 62 amino acids predicts only a hydrophilic region with charged amino acids. a protein encoded by the DI RNA as it emerges from the 80S ribosomal subunit finds its target cotranslationally. the target for the WAPEFPWM domain is unknown at this time."}
