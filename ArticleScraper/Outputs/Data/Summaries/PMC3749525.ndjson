{"summary": "HRVs are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens traditionally associated with mild and self-limited upper respiratory tract infections (\u2018colds\u2019) genetic characterization of HRVs detected by molecular methods has revealed much greater diversity than previously described. approximately one-third of HRV infections are now known to be caused by a third group of rhinoviruses (species C) three of these species are designated Rhinovirus A, Rhinovirus B and Rhinovirus C. the nomenclature reflects their primary tropism for the respiratory tract. humans are the only known natural host, although primates could also be susceptible. some neutralization determinants are located on the external VP1 protein in the virus nucleocapsid. a threshold of 25 % nucleotide and 12 % amino acid sequence divergence generally corresponds to the previous serological division of EVs into members of the same or different serotypes. VP1 sequencing is now routinely used for identification and assignment of new EV types without serological confirmation of antigenic differences. previously published proposals for the classification of HRV-C have been adopted by the Picornaviridae Study Group as the primary mechanism for defining HRV-C types. previously used term \u2018serotype\u2019 reflects the identification and classification of HRV variants by antigenic properties. previously used term \u2018type\u2019 reflects the identification and classification of HRV variants by either antigenic properties. divergent HRV-B isolates showed a minimum value that supported a 12 % threshold. the proposed thresholds for type assignment are shown as dotted lines. total datasets of available VP1 sequences contained unequal representations of different types within each species. peak between p-distance values of 0.19 and 0.26 corresponded to comparisons between variants within each of the four basally branching phylogenetic clusters. phylogenetic trees showed the VP1 region of HRV-A, -B and -C. the vast majority of sequences within each terminal clade showed intra-clade VP1 divergence substantially less than the proposed thresholds. most of these also showed a minimum inter-clade VP1 divergence (with a different assigned type) that was much greater than the proposed threshold. 24 A45 0.0813 0.2521 A46

neighbour. three new types of HRV-A and three of HRV-B have been proposed previously. newly designated HRV-B104 represented a division of a previously single type, HRV-B52, based on the existence of two discrete phylogenetic clades with VP1 p-distances of 0.121\u20130.142 between them. a further 18 types were added to the total of 33 first defined in 2010. clade containing the original ATCC isolates has retained the HRV-B52 designation. the clade containing field isolates has been reassigned as HRV-B104. similar variability was observed in species A where two of the proposed new types showed distances close to the assignment threshold. contemporary sequences that belonged to HRV-A29 by VP1 p-distance from the prototype strains showed a maximum divergence of 0.159 when compared with each other. the type pair HRV-A25 and -A62 showed VP1 pairwise distances ranging from 0.093 to 0.103 from each other. isolates of HRV-A36 and -A89 showed VP1 p-distances of 0.1292. the antiserum to HRV-A89 cannot neutralize HRV-A89. only one HRV-C type showed p-distance values that violated proposed thresholds. p-distances between or within types consistent with proposed 13 % VP1 divergence threshold are shown in blue (intra-type) and red (inter-type) comparisons that violate the VP1 assignment threshold are shown in pink (different HRV types but with distances falling below the threshold) the majority of HRV strains grouped congruently between VP1 and VP4/VP2. only one sequence showed evidence of phylogenetic incongruence. in VP4/VP2, this sequence showed a VP1 p-distance of 0.146. shorter length and greater sequence conservation than VP1 resulted in less-well-defined thresholds and a greater proportion of pairwise comparisons close to the assignment threshold. more problematic was the larger number of HRV variants of the same type with VP4/VP2 divergence above the assigned thresholds. original HRV-C classification included 28 PATS, which were temporarily assigned on the basis of VP4/VP2 sequence divergence alone. 16 have since been reassigned as new types based on VP1 divergence. eight further divergent VP4/VP2 groups were identified among species A (n = 4), and species B (n = 4). distributions of pairwise nucleotide p-distances were constructed from a total of 435 HRV-A, 133 HRV-B and 206 HRV-C VP1 sequences. a threshold of 13 % was identified for both HRV-A and -C sequences, while the less-divergent HRV-B isolates showed a minimum value that supported a 12 % threshold. total datasets of available VP1 sequences contained unequal representations of different types within each species, ranging from one to a maximum of 13 for HRV-A (A49), 10 for HRV-B (B69) and 22 for HRV-C (C3) comparisons with certain types are over-represented in the distance totals. tree was constructed from 100 bootstrap resampled sequence alignments of maximum composite likelihood distances. phylogenetic clusters with pairwise p-distances ranging from 0.1900 to 0.2600 are indicated by grey-outlined boxes. new HRV types defined on the basis of sequence divergence in VP1 are shown in red. new HRV types defined on the basis of sequence divergence are indicated in bold.

VP1 sequences are unavailable for the remaining 11 PATs. eight further divergent VP4/VP2 groups were identified among species A (n = 4) and species B (n = 4). a further three provisionally assigned HRV-C types were also detected. the VP4/VP2 region has been most commonly used for genetic characterization of HRV in clinical samples. comparison of its predictive value compared with type assignments based on VP1 sequences provides evidence for its suitability of HRV type identification along with some restrictions. a more extensive global or sentinel system of type identification should allow large-scale investigations of HRV epidemiology, transmission and evolution. a more extensive global or sentinel system of type identification should allow large-scale investigations of HRV epidemiology, transmission and evolution. in the VP1 region, an HRV type should have at least 13 % (HRV-A), 12 % (HRV-B) or 13 % (HRV-C) nucleotide divergence from all other HRV types. patterns of phylogenetic grouping with existing types may contribute to its assignment as would any available information on serological cross-reactivity. VP1 region for definition of new HRV types should not discourage widespread continued use of 5\u2032-untranslated region and VP4/VP2 screening protocols. the guidelines should be subject to further review as additional data becomes available. the difficulties with culturing species C rhinoviruses have prevented their serological properties from being directly investigated. a simple, fast and effective method of typing EVs by pyrosequencing has recently been developed. this may become extremely useful as pyrosequencing becomes more widely available worldwide. a shorter region than the whole VP1 would be similarly predictive of HRV types and could be used for future type assignments. the thresholds we have proposed divide HRV sequences into groups that correspond most consistently with phylogenetic groupings. Placing the threshold at a minimum point in the distribution additionally minimizes the number of conflicting distances within an assigned type. the identification and definition of HRV types by using genetic data within the capsid region has the potential to revolutionize HRV typing. the criteria for HRV have been formulated as follows. an HRV type should be phylogenetically distinct from other HRV types. analysis of divergence should include at least 90 % of the full VP1 coding region for each variant. the 'prototype strain' of each new HRV type should be the first reported full-genome sequence or, if this is unavailable, the first reported full VP1 sequence. the 'prototype strain' of each new HRV type should be the first reported full-genome sequence or, if this is unavailable, the first reported full VP1 sequence. a 450 nt segment at the 3\u2032 end of VP1 was effective for EV type identification. a second study showed full correlation of a 303 nt stretch of VP1 with neutralization data. a simple, fast and effective method of typing EVs by pyrosequencing has recently been developed. all available HRV VP4/VP2 and VP1 sequences were downloaded from GenBank in November 2012. genome regions included the full VP1 region and a fragment of VP4/VP2 (nt 616\u20131004 numbered according to GenBank accession no. EF582385 for HRV-C4) analysis of recombination within the capsid region of HRV-A, -B and -C. datasets containing these two non-consecutive regions were concatenated to give one continuous sequence, which was then additionally analysed for the occurrence of recombination. any isolate that did not show a close grouping with a prototype full genome or represented a distinct phylogenetic cluster of HRV-C was selected for amplification of the VP1 region. sequences that were 90 % complete across these regions or were classified as non-functional were excluded. phylogenetic trees were inspected visually for evidence of incongruence between the VP4/VP2 and -C regions. each sequence set was examined using a combination of algorithms implemented in the software package. VP4/VP2 sequences generated from several studies of HRV molecular epidemiology in the UK were divided into groups based on phylogenetic clustering. any isolate that did not show a close grouping with a prototype full genome or represented a distinct phylogenetic cluster of HRV-C was selected for amplification. all sequences were aligned using the sse v1.0 sequence editor package. pairwise nucleotide p-distances were calculated using the program Sequence Distances within the package. phylogenetic trees were constructed from 100 bootstrap resampled sequence alignments of maximum composite likelihood. each HRV species dataset was further analysed using the gard program. any predicted recombination breakpoints were analysed by construction of neighbour-joining maximum composite likelihood trees."}
