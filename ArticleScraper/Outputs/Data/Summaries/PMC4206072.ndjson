{"summary": "ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) was performed prospectively in 207 febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy. three observers independently recorded the presence of lung parenchymal abnormality, and also indicated the cause of the lung parenchymal abnormality between infectious and noninfectious causes. chest radiograph is recommended for patients with respiratory signs and symptoms in order to rule out the presence of pneumonia. the problem is that a chest radiograph frequently cannot depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia. CT scans were performed using a 16-detector row (LightSpeed16, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) scanner. if neutropenic fever is prolonged for two to three days, routine examination by ULDCT is performed in all patients. all imaging data were reconstructed using high- and low-spatial frequency reconstruction filters. the monitors were used to view both mediastinal (width, 400 HU; level, 20 HU) and lung (width, 1,500 HU; level, \u20132,700 HU) images were assessed independently by three thoracic radiologists. bilateral patchy or diffuse areas of GGO, sparing subpleural regions (late phase) CT, computed tomography; GGO, ground-glass opacity. image quality was graded as excellent when images were comparable to standard-dose CT obtained for daily practice. each observer recorded the presence or absence of lung parenchymal abnormalities. all three observers reached a consensus as an acceptable image quality level. transverse and coronal ULDCT scans in a patient with streptococcal pneumonia show consolidation involving the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (arrows) all patients underwent chest X-rays. final diagnosis was made in each case by reviewing each patient's medical record and laboratory findings. an internal medicine physician (S.Y.P.) who subspecialized in respiratory medicine for eight years made an integrative confirmative diagnosis. the decision was not concordant, we requested consultantation to the division of infectious disease. noninfectious pneumonia was made on lung parenchymal lesions. the patients in this category did not show any response to antibiotic or antiviral treatment. extrathoracic fever focus was elucidated by making a diagnosis of extrathoracic fever focus by disclosing definite evidence. clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever was based on fulfillment of body temperature higher than 38 Celsius with absolute neutrophil count lower than 500. if neutropenic fever is prolonged for two to three days, routine examination by ULDCT is performed in all patients because chest X-ray frequently fails to depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia. diagnostic evaluation CT images were assessed independently by three thoracic radiologists. they knew only that the patients had been referred for evaluation of neutropenic fever, and were unaware of all other clinical information. the image quality was graded as excellent when images were comparable to those of standard-dose CT obtained for daily practice. the image quality was acceptable when they were satisfactory for diagnostic evaluation; and unacceptable when they were unsatisfactory. all three observers reached a consensus as acceptable image quality level. transverse and coronal ULDCT scans in a patient with streptococcal pneumonia show consolidation involving the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (arrows) all three observers reached a consensus as acceptable image quality level. patients were categorized according to four groups based on infectious pneumonia, noninfectious pulmonary disease, extrathoracic fever focus, and no remarkable chest CT without any specific lung fever focus. the group was subdivided into four categories according to pathogens identified:bacterial,viral,fungal, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms. interobserver agreements for imaging quality and differential diagnosis of ULDCT were estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. ICC results were interpreted as follows: 0-0.2 indicates poor agreement; 0.3-0.4 indicates fair agreement; 0.5-0.6 indicates moderate agreement; 0.7-0.8 indicates strong agreement; and > 0.8 indicates almost perfect agreement. Sensitivity for differential diagnosis of infectious pneumonia was calculated based on per-patient which was a confirmed pathogen. final diagnoses were reached by biopsy (graft-versus-host disease, relapsing leukemia, and all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome) final diagnoses were reached by biopsy (graft-versus-host disease, relapsing leukemia, and all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome), observing the clinical course (overhydration in four patients, drug toxicity in two patients improved after drug off), and BAL (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in three image quality of ULDCT Median body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m2, which belonged to the normal weight category (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) out of 207 patients, 29 patients (14%) fell into the overweight category (25-29.9 kg/m2). diagnostic performance The presence or absence of lung abnormality was correctly determined in 183 of 207 patients (88.4%), 169 (81.6%), and 189 (91.3%). overall correct diagnoses including infectious and noninfectious causes for lung abnormalities were made in 105 of 151 patients (69.5%) with lung abnormality, 104 (68.9%), and 108 (71.5%), respectively, by three observers. the detection rate of lung parenchymal opacity through chest X-ray was only 38.5%. the mortality rate in patients with infectious pneumonia who died within one month was 5% (7/139 patients) image quality of ULDCT Median body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m2. observer 1 Observer 2 Observer 3 Excellent 135 (65.2) 141 (68.1) 140 (67.6) Acceptable 68 (32.9) 65 (31.4) 64 (30.9) Unacceptable 4 (1.9) 1 (0.5) 3 (1.5) Agreement (95% CI)a) 0.92 (0.91-0.93) Values are presented as number (%).
