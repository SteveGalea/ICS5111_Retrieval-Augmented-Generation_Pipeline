{"summary": "aim The authors set out to develop a new prediction rule for poor outcome (re-consultation with new or worsened symptoms, or hospital admission) in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough. acute cough is one of the main reasons for consulting in primary care. antibiotic treatment for acute cough has been shown to have little or no effect. majority of acute cough cases are caused by a self-limiting lower respiratory tract infection. antibiotics are prescribed to >50% of patients. the performance to predict poor outcome in acute cough patients was compared. the improvement of the new prediction rule\u2019s performance was evaluated by including additional test results. the new prediction rule, RISSC85, presented in this study outperforms these alternatives. missing covariate information was imputed, on a country-specific basis due to heterogeneity between countries. group-specific model was reduced in a backwards fashion ( = 0.05) the prediction rule was constructed using the final general model and its pooled parameter estimates. the optimal cut-off value was determined using the Youden index. the authors derived a simplified prediction rule by dichotomising continuous covariates (diastolic blood pressure and number of years stopped smoking) and retaining only the covariate level with the highest impact on the predicted odds of poor outcome for multilevel covariates. influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, polyomavirus, and bocavirus. RISSC85, presented in this study outperforms these alternatives, and could not be improved by including additional test results. the number of variables selected for inclusion in an imputation-specific logistic regression model was chosen based on the number of included patients. the authors removed non-significant variables in a backwards fashion ( = 0.10), included interaction terms between remaining fixed effects, and removed non-significant interaction terms ( = 0.05). variables that were significant in at least two imputation-specific models were retained in the group-specific model. the new prediction rule\u2019s performance to predict poor outcome was compared with that of five existing prediction rules (PSI step 1, CRB, CURB, CRB-65, and CURB-65) using their AUCs.8\u201310 The improvement in discriminative ability obtained by including information on biomarkers (CRP or BUN), chest radiography, and aetiology was evaluated using the AUCs. the final model for group B shows that the odds of a poor outcome are affected by the use of antidepressants (P = 0.0204), the severity of interference with daily activities (P = 0.0016), and the severity of sputum as assessed by the patient (P = 0.0005) pooled odds ratios (ORs) for group-specific models are available from the authors on request. low risk for poor outcome when the predicted probability is below this threshold, and at high risk when it is above this threshold. pooled odds ratios for parameters in the \u2018clinical\u2019 model Parameter Odds ratio (95% CI) Patient\u2019s context General patient information (patient diary) Group B 1.672 (1.282 to 2.180) Years stopped smoking: high (>45 years ago) 1.006 (1.002 to 1.010) Group C 2.271 (1.515 to 3.406) Patient\u2019s symptoms ( CURB-65 and RISSC85 demonstrates that RISSC85 outperforms all existing prediction rules. table 3. Area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) for the new prediction rule (RISSC85) alone. RISSC85 + VIR 0.64 (0.62 to 0.67) RISSC85 + ETIO 0.64 (0.62 to 0.68) BAC = bacterial agents. BUN = blood urea nitrogen. CRP = C-reactive protein. ETIO = aetiology. VIR = viral agents. Including chest radiography resulted in an OR for poor outcome of 0.927 (95% CI = 0.623 to 1.380) if pneumonia is detected on the radiograph using a 15% threshold resulted in sensitivities between 85% and 87%, specificities between 27% and 28%, and a NPV of 86%. Using a 25% threshold resulted in sensitivities between 32% and 36%, specificities between 80% and 82%, PPVs between 30% and 32%, and an NPV of 83%. the simplified RISSC85 has 43% sensitivity, 73% specificity, 28% PPV, scores calculated as +1*group (B or C) +1*interference with daily activities +1*crackles +1*diastolic blood pressure low (85 mmHg) +1*years stopped smoking high (>45 years ago) +1*sputum (severe) NPV = negative predictive value. PPV = positive predictive value. CURB = confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure. CURB = urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure. CURB = confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure. CURB = confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure. Adding continuous BUN concentration to the clinical model resulted in an OR for poor outcome of 0.970 (95% CI = 0.803 to 1.185) per 10 mg/dL rise in concentration. addition of viral aetiology resulted in an OR for poor outcome of 0.821 (95% CI = 0.672 to 1.004) if only a single bacterial agent was detected. 0.745 (95% CI = 0.583 to 0.952) if only a single viral agent was detected. 1.281 (95% CI = 0.780 to 2.109) if multiple viral agents were detected. the simplified RISSC85 has 43% sensitivity, 73% specificity, 28% PPV, and 84% NPV. using 2 or 4 as a threshold for poor outcome resulted in 89% and 9% sensitivity, 24% and 96% specificity, 22% and 32% PPV, and 90% and 81% NPV. RISSC85 is based on information related to the patient\u2019s baseline risk of poor outcome, severity of interference with daily activities, number of years stopped smoking or >45 years, severity of sputum at the day of consultation, presence of crackles, and diastolic blood pressure or >85 mmHg. a person indicating sputum to be a severe problem does not have an increased odds of poor prognosis. the number of included poor-outcome cases, and the total number of included patients, were rather low in some countries (15 and 150, respectively, in Slovakia, Sweden, Slovenia, France, and Italy) the prediction rule can, however, still be used in other countries, by estimating their baseline risk for poor outcome using literature or personal experience. the covariate indicating whether the history taking was suggestive of pneumonia was not retained as an important predictor in any of the group-specific models. the covariate \u2018Intervention\u2019 (indicating whether the patient received amoxicillin or placebo) was not retained in any of the group-specific models, suggesting that amoxicillin does not provide protection against poor outcome in adult patients with acute cough. RISSC85 is based on information related to the patient\u2019s baseline risk of poor outcome, severity of interference with daily activities, number of years stopped smoking or >45 years, severity of sputum at the day of consultation, presence of crackles, and diastolic blood pressure. the only plausible explanation the authors put forward is that patients rating their symptoms as extreme were exaggerating, whereas patients rating their symptoms as severe were modest but actually really ill. poor-outcome cases, and the total number of included patients, were rather low in some countries. this study focused on a limited number of countries. the prediction rule can, however, still be used in other countries. RISSC85 is the best currently available option to predict poor outcome in adult patients presenting to primary care with acute cough. PPV is only 27% while NPV is 86%, but this tool will be more suitable for reassuring patients with acute cough that, given their symptoms, the risk of poor outcome is low. obtaining CRP, BUN, aetiology, and chest radiography has no added prognostic value. the UK was also supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), in Barcelona by 2009 SGR 911 Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias (Ciberes CB06/06/0028), and in Belgium by the Research Foundation, Flanders. the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."}
