{"summary": "NK cells are members of group 1 ILCs due to their ability to produce IFN and be cytolytic. NK cells are found in many tissues including bone marrow (BM), blood, liver, thymus, and spleen. NK cells develop from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) in the bone marrow. CLPs in the mouse BM differentiate into a pre-NK precursor (pre-NKP) with a phenotype of Lin CD117CD127+ and express some NK cell specific receptors. IL-15 is a cytokine required for their development as shown by IL-15 KO mice. NK cells are present systemically in bone marrow, secondary lymphoid structures, peripheral nonlymphoid organs, and blood. NK cells are present systemically in bone marrow, secondary lymphoid structures, peripheral nonlymphoid organs, and blood. NK cells are present systemically in bone marrow, secondary lymphoid structures. NK cells migrate to either the blood stream or into secondary lymphoid structures. mucosal tissue specific NK cells could also differentiate in situ rather than be seeded by LN or peripheral blood precursors. migration from BM to a specific tissue is a complex first step to establishing residency. NK cells of the Lung Mucosa 10% of total lung resident lymphocytes are NK cells. this is a higher NK cell number than other nonlymphoid organs. NK cells in humans are CD56dim CD16+ and mostly NKp46+ similar to NK cells in the blood. approximately 30% of lung resident NK cells express KIRs. around 80% of the CD56bright population expressed CD94 similar to the phenotypes found in peripheral blood. NK cells express less KIR in bronchiolar lavage fluid. dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the lung are triggered via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to produce inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. NK cells are present in all gut tissues (small intestine, large intestine, and colon) as cells of the IEL and LP compartments. NK cells in the murine intestinal mucosa also appear immature. NK cells found in the gut mucosa and FRT during the naive state exhibit an immature phenotype being CD27med-hiCD11bhi in mice and CD56brightCD16 in humans. this may suggest that gut and FRT resident NK cells are derived from NK precursors (NKP, pink), which migrate from bone marrow to lymph nodes (LN), where they differentiate into immature NK cells. uterine NK cells (uNK, orange cell) have to balance help with fetal implantation via trophoblast recruitment, vascularization, and/or tolerance with ability to respond to pathogens. if stimulation of NK cells in response to a pathogen is high enough, IFN is expressed and may result in loss of pregnancy. uterine NK cells express chemokine receptors including Ly49D, H, C, I, G, and A. different from human uterine NK cells in that they exhibit lower cytolytic activity and are more important in vascular remodeling for proper fetal implantation. NK cells migrate further to different sites in the body including mucosal tissues. factors from these sources could induce NK precursor differentiation to attain different levels of maturation and education. new data on tissue specific difference in NK cell differentiation may support the hypothesis that NK precursor cells seed peripheral organs. small intestine IELs emerge from the thymus as recent thymic emigrants which express differing levels of the gut homing integrin 47 [22] small intestine IELs emerge from the thymus as recent thymic emigrants which express differing levels of the gut homing integrin. the maturation status of most lung NK cells resembles those from blood. however, a recent study identified a population of NK cells in the lung capable of being further differentiated. the murine lung microenvironment could condition NK cells separately from the bone marrow. NK cells found in the lung exhibit a mature phenotype being CD27loCD11bhi in mice and CD56dim CD16+ in humans. NK cells in the murine intestinal mucosa appear immature. NK cells in the murine intestinal mucosa also appear immature. iCD11bmed and CD27loCD11blo NK cells produce large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN. after infection, significant changes occur in NK cell frequencies in the small intestine and lamina propria. if peripheral NK cell infiltration occurs or phenotypic changes in resident NK cell populations has not been investigated. dendritic cells (DC) draining from the lamina propria of the gut (CD103+) or DC from the FRT to the LN interact with immature NK cells and imprint the tissue address (47/CCR9 for gut mucosa) in gut, NK cells can be IELs (orange cells) or in the LP (green cell) and respond to infectious pathogen (red circles) activated DCs and cytokine milieu in the tissue microenvironment becomes uterine uterine NK cells exhibit functional characteristics of immature NK cells having high cytokine production and low cytotoxic potential. they also express Ly49 receptors including Ly49D, H, C, I, G, and A. they are different from human uterine NK cells in that they exhibit lower cytolytic activity. NK cells migrate from the BM into the blood then migrate further to different sites in the body including mucosal tissues. factors from these sources could induce NK precursor differentiation to attain different levels of maturation and education. new data on tissue specific difference in NK cell differentiation may support the hypothesis that NK precursor cells seed peripheral organs. NK cells resemble a more mature phenotype and could come directly from the peripheral blood. despite the lung NK cell phenotype, the presence and the effect of the lung microbiome on the development of asthma and chronic inflammation suggest that NK cells could also be modified in situ. NK cells are recruited from the periphery within a few days of these events. cytokine IL-15 is required for development and the expansion of developing NK cells. other cytokines and signals can cause NK cells to expand and respond to infection. NK cell CTL activity in response to influenza is mediated through antibodies and ADCC or via the recognition of viral haemagglutinin by the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp46 [55] in mice infected with influenza A (PR8), infiltrating NK cells are CD27lowCD11bhi and appear to be of a mature phenotype. IL-15 in complex with IL-15R can help in recruitment and activation of NK cells during rhinovirus infection NK cells play a role in early immunity and control of lung fungal and bacterial infections. NK cells help in early control of Cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillosis. by producing IFN these cells play a critical role in early immunity. NK cells appear to be dispensable for Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice [69], in a rat model of infection, but were essential in they were essential for early control of the bacterium [70]. IL-15 KO mice had greater bacterial burdens than WT animals; depletion of NK cells also resulted in great colonization of the murine gut with Salmonella. NK cell IFN production from macrophages was critical for this response. NK cells in the GI tract are involved in control of parasitic infection. NK cells in humans are also important for innate control of gut mucosal infections. NK cells in gut mucosa play an important role in protecting against orally acquired infections. the resident cells in these tissues are all capable of producing IFN and cytolytic activity through ADCC. the importance of IFN was noted early in response to vaginal infection of mice with HSV-2. SV-2 suggests NK cell innate protection could be important in humans. NK cells play two important roles in that they are required for tissue reorganization, vascularization, implantation of the fetus, and tolerance. NK cells tested for their ability to prevent this colonization in mice were shown to not have an impact. T. gondii induces a potent Th1 response including NK cell production of IFN. parasite infection is also known to cause spontaneous abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. NK cells were demonstrated early to respond to influenza infection in the lungs of humans through their production of IFN [53] NK cell CTL activity in response to influenza is mediated through antibodies and ADCC or via the recognition of viral haemagglutinin by the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp46 [55] in mice infected with influenza A (PR8), infiltrating NK cells are CD27lowCD11bhi and appear to be of a mature phenotype depletion of NK cells has shown that NK cells can contribute to early control of Mtb but are not required for long term survival against infection. NK cells play a role in early immunity and control of lung fungal and bacterial infections. NK cells can be regulated via IL-12 and IFN/ provided by myeloid populations. NK cell can also be pathogenic in the lung during infection from overproduction of IFN. questions remain that would be interesting to address are how to boost NK cell responses. + NK1.1+ ILCs were shown to contribute to gut pathology and ileitis during Toxoplasma gondii infection. their function relied on IL-15 and resulted in CCL3 dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into the lamina propria. NK cells in humans are also important for innate control of gut mucosal infections. NK cells in gut mucosa play an important role in protecting against orally acquired infections. recruitment of NK cells was also important for the ability of NK cells to protect against vaginal HSV-2 infection. mice were more susceptible and had higher viral loads in the CNS after vaginal infection most likely due to impaired NK cell trafficking to the site of infection. human NK cells were recruited into the genital tract of female mice infected with HSV-2 suggesting that NK cell innate protection could be important in humans as well. uterine NK cells did not respond to direct TLR triggering. pathogen stimulation could cause an imbalance towards inflammation. this is supported by a study investigating toxoplasma gondii infection induced abortion in mice. conventional NK cells are found in all mucosal tissues and play an important role in first line of defense against bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
