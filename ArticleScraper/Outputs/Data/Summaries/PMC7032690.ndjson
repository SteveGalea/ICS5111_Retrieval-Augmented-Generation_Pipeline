{"summary": "a total of 562,022 cases of incident diabetes (type 1 diabetes [n = 2,426]: mean age at diagnosis is 32.5 years, 48.4% men; type 2 diabetes [n = 559,596]: mean age at diagnosis is 61.8 years, 51.9% men) were included. for type 1 diabetes, the incidence increased from 3.5 (95% CI 2.2\u20134.9) to 5.3 (95% CI 3.4\u20137.1) per 100,000 person-years. incidence of type 1 diabetes increased over time from 75.4 (95% CI 70.1\u201380.7) to 110.8 (95% CI 104.1\u2013117.5) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.2% [95% CI 3.1\u20135.3], p 0.05) in men and from 45.0 (95% CI 41.4\u201348.6) to 62.1 (AAPC 3.3% [95% CI 2.3\u20134.2], p 0.05) in women. type 1 diabetes mellitus is a complex progressive disease of rapidly growing prevalence. prevalence of type 2 diabetes is estimated at 415 million and is projected to escalate to 642 million over the next 25 years. a territory-wide electronic medical record system, adopted in 2000, captures demographic information, diagnostic and procedure codes, laboratory results, and drug prescriptions of people attending public hospitals and clinics. diabetes was ascertained based on one or more of the following qualifying criteria: (1) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in any one available HbA1c measurement [6]. in the HKDSD, a small subset of people received ICD-9 coding for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. in the HKDR, diabetes subtype was determined by the referring physician and independently confirmed with chart review by one of the investigators. ratios of type 1 to type 2 diabetes codes 4 or prescription of a combination of short- and long-acting insulin and no noninsulin antihyperglycaemic treatment within the first year of diagnosis yielded the optimal sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI 87.2\u2013100.0), specificity of 100.0% (95% CI 87.2\u2013100.0), PPV of 100.0% (95% CI 76.8\u2013100.0), and NPV of 100.0% (95% we calculated the annual percentage change (APC) and the average APC (AAPC) in incidence rates with 95% CI by sex and by age bands. the optimal number of line segments that best fit the pattern was identified. trend analysis including reporting of APC and AAPC for both type 2 and type 1 diabetes was restricted to the period between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015. ascertained based on one or more of the following qualifying criteria: (1) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in any one available HbA1c measurement [6]; (2) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 7.0 mmol/L in any one available FPG measurement [7]; (3) prescription of noninsulin antihyperglycaemic drugs and/or (4) prescription of insulin for at least 28 days of 24,060 patients in the HKDR, we excluded people with onset dates outside of 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2015. of the remaining 15,297 people with newly diagnosed diabetes, type 1 diabetes was confirmed in 103 patients. the cohort was separated in a 2:1 ratio for derivation and validation of the algorithm. incident case of diabetes was identified by the first occurrence of any episode. at least 2 years of diabetes-free observation prior was required to enable discrimination of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC) and joinpoint Regression Program version 4.6.0.0 (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) results Of 778,051 people captured in the HKDSD, we excluded 33,916 people who had diabetes codes but did not fulfil other criteria of diabetes. diabetes peaked in the age groups of 5\u20139 years in the female sex and 10\u201314 years in the male sex and declined with increasing age. the rate ratio for type 1 diabetes was 1.38 (95% CI 1.10\u20131.37, p 0.05) in girls compared with boys. 2.2 (9.8 to 6.0) 0.55 Type 2 diabetes Age 20 years Boys 5.9 (3.4\u20138.5) 0.05 2005\u20132008 0.8 (15.1 to 19.6) 0.92 2008\u20132015 7.5 (2.9\u201312.4) 0.05 Girls 4.8 (2.7\u20137.0) 0.05 2005\u20132008 2.1 (15.5 to 13.4) 0.73 2008\u20132015 7.1 (3.0\u201311.2) 0.05 Age 20 to 40 years Men 4.2 (3.1\u20135.3) 0.05 2005\u20132015 2.2 (1.3\u20133.2) 0.05 the incidence rose with age and peaked in the age groups of 65\u201375 years in both men and women. the number of new cases was 34,921 in 2002, 37,229 in 2003, 58,375 in 2004, 33,759 in 2005, and 31,061 in 2006. in men, the incidence increased from 75.4 (95% CI 70.1\u201380.7) to 94.4 (95% CI 88.3\u2013100.5) per 100,000 person-years (APC 8.8% [95% CI 4.8\u201313.0], p 0.05) between 2005 and 2008. in women, the incidence increased from 45.0 (95% CI 41.4\u201348.6) to 55.1 (95% CI 51.0\u201359.1) per 100,000 person-years (APC 4.2%) in men, the incidence of type 2 diabetes increased from 697.0 (95% CI 681.1\u2013712.8) to 852.7 (95% CI 836.0\u2013869.3) per 100,000 person-years between 2005 and 2012. incidence increased from 569.7 (95% CI 555.3\u2013584.0) to 639.8 (95% CI 601.8\u2013628.5) per 100,000 person-years between 2005 and 2011. 2,426 people with newly diagnosed diabetes were classified as having type 1 diabetes. 774 (31.9%) were aged 20 years and 845 (34.8%) and 807 (33.3%) were aged 20 to 40 years and 40 years respectively. age-standardised incidence of type 1 diabetes increased from 2005 to 2015 in people aged 20 years in both sexes.

Conversely, the incidence of type 1 diabetes has continued to rise in places of low disease prevalence, including East Asia [12,13]. obesity rose from 11.6% in the mid-1990s to 16.7% in 2005 [16]. prevalence was 17.6% in primary school students and 19.9% in secondary school students in the last estimation in 2018 [17]. in contrast to the rising trend of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, the incidence of adult-onset type 1 diabetes has not increased. prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been stable in men and has declined in women since the mid-1990s [23,24], which is attributable to a series of government-led health promotion initiatives targeting healthier lifestyles. the absence of a rise might reflect levelling off in exposure to risk factors. alangh and colleagues reported 10-year secular trends in diabetes incidence in canada. incidence increased moderately by 24% in the european population compared with a 15-fold increase in the Chinese population by 2005. excess of 21,000 new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2004 compared with 2003 could be due to heightened health vigilance at the aftermath of the epidemic. the modest dip in the number of new cases in the ensuing 3 years (from 2005 to 2007) could support earlier identification of cases during the transitory period, leaving fewer cases to be detected. misclassifying type 1 diabetes would significantly inflate the incidence of type 1 diabetes, whereas the impact on incidence of type 2 diabetes was probably minimal. despite limitations in details of the extracted information, we could not discern patients with other aetiologies of diabetes. number of new cases of type 2 diabetes by year in the Hong Kong Diabetes Surveillance Database, 2002\u20132015. 158.4KB, tif) S3 Fig. Incidence trends of type 2 diabetes in boys aged 20 years using restricted cubic spline. additional data file (85KB, doc)."}
