{"summary": "more than 78 million people have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and 39 million have died since the start of the AIDS epidemic. at the end of 2012, there were 35.2 million people living with HIV globally and there were 2.3 million new HIV infections in 2012 [1][2]. chitosan, a natural biocompatible polysaccharide derived from crustacean shells, has been used as a dietary supplement for weight loss. chitosan has also shown anti-HIV properties that are similar to the action of microbicides. chitosan has also shown anti-HIV properties that are similar to the action of microbicides. the plasmid vectors used do not replicate in mammalian hosts. they can persist in host cells and express the siRNAs for a period of days to weeks. the use of such a siRNA approach for mucosal (vaginal) gene transfer in form of a microbicide has not been explored. chlipid nanocomplexes were vortexed for 15 min at room temperature before administration. the mixtures containing CNs with DNA or psiRNAs were vortexed for 30 min at room temperature before administration. the siRNA targeting sequences are at position of 142 nt of LTR, 59 nt of Gag, 57 nt of Tat and 42 nt of Rev in the HIV89.6 genome, and 70 nt of rhesus macaque CCR5 and 97 nt of rhesus macaque CXCR4. the top strand and the bottom strand of each siRNA-encoding oligonucleotide were PBMC cultures grown in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 1 g of each vector-driven siRNA plus 1 g of HIV89.6 proviral DNA. the viral supernatant collected 48 h after transfection was examined. cell studies using CNs HEK293 cells grown on 96-well plate were co-transfected with 1 g of each vector-driven siRNA (psiLTR, psiTat, psiRev, psiGag) or pU6 vector control, along with 1 g of HIV89.6 proviral DNA. the viral supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection. old balb/c mice were kept in pathogen-free conditions at the university of south Florida College of Medicine vivarium. mice were given 10 g of Lipofectamine + 10g of plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) lungs were lavaged with 1 ml of PBS introduced through the trachea. a mixture of cream plus CNs containing plasmid siRNA cocktail was evaluated for its efficacy to prevent HIV infection in rhesus monkeys. serum (3 ml) and CVL fluid (5 ml) were collected from all rabbits on days 0, 3, 7, 11, and 14 after treatment. eight female rhesus monkeys (5\u20139 kg) were divided into two groups. all five macaques used were pretreated with a single intramuscular dose of Depo-Provera (30 mg/animal) the group of five macaques was divided into 2 control and 3 treatment monkeys. a mixture of cream (20 mg) and CNs containing psiRNA cocktail were applied vaginally on day 6. viral titers were measured by the absorbance readings at 405 nm. chlipid nanocomplexes were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) water-soluble chitosan (1 mg/ml) was vortexed for 15 min at room temperature before administration. siRNA targeting sequences are at position of 142 nt of LTR, 59 nt of Gag, 57 nt of Tat and 42 nt of Rev in the HIV89.6 genome. top strand and bottom strand of each siRNA-encoding oligonucleotide were annealed and digested with Apa1 and EcoR1 before cloning into pSilencer1.0-U6. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the 1 g of each siRNA above with 1 g of each siRNA. the viral supernatant was. viral supernatant collected 48 h after transfection and p24 levels were measured with the HIV1 p24 ELISA kit (Beckman Coulter) cell studies using CNs HEK293 cells grown on 96-well plates were co-transfected with 1 g of each vector-driven siRNA plus 1 g of HIV89.6 proviral DNA using CNs. plasmids along with p89.6 proviral DNA for 24 h, washed with PBS and fresh medium was added. safety studies of the CNs in mice and rabbit vaginal irritation (RVI) model. chlipids and plasmid siRNA cocktail mixed with an anti-inflammatory cream were administered intravaginally to healthy rabbits. increased number of CD45+ leukocytes in the CVL was determined at the termination of treatment. three groups consisting of two female rabbits each were maintained under the same environmental conditions. a group of five cycling rhesus monkeys were selected for the in vivo experiment. the group of five macaques was divided into 2 control and 3 treatment monkeys. a mixture of cream and CNs containing psiRNA cocktail were applied vaginally on days 1, 3 and 6. nM concentration was 5\u2019-CAT TTG GAT TAG CAG AAA GCC TGT TGG AGA ACA AAG GATGTCAA-3\u2019. all five macaques (2 control and 3 treatment animals) were infected with SHIV. titers were measured by the absorbance readings at 405 nm both before and after infection. transmission electron micrographs of chitosan, Lipofectamine and CNs complexed with pEGFP. distribution and quantification of in vivo transfection of pEGFP in BAL cells of C57/BL6 mice. psiCXCR4 and psiCCR5 were used independently. there was no significant decrease in viral titers. HEK293 cells grown in 96-well plates were co-transfected with 1 g of each vector-driven siRNA (psiLTR, psiTat, psiRev, psiGag) or pU6 vector control, along with 1 g of HIV89.6 provir the virus was removed 2 h after the infection by centrifugation. supernatants were collected on days 0, and 4 and p24 levels were determined by HIV-1 p24 ELISA. the results suggest that cocktail psiRNAs decreased HIV titers significantly by day 4 compared with the other panels. cells were transfected with either chitosan or Lipofectamine 2000 or chlipid nanocomplexes. at 48 h post-administration, the tissues were fixed in 10% formalin. sections were immunostained using anti-GFP antibody and nuclear-stained with DAPI. supernatants were collected on days 0, 2, 3 and titrated for p24 concentration (pg/ml) using a p24-ELISA. supernatants were titrated for p24 concentration (pg/ml) using a p24-ELISA. plasmid siRNA cocktail complexed with chlipids formulated as cream showed no neutrophil infiltration. cells were cytospun, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 100% methanol. cells were later treated with anti-CD45 tagged with Alexa Fluor 555. the results suggest that treatment with chitosan nanoparticles did not cause toxicity in rhesus monkeys with respect to proteins (total protein, albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino-transferase, aspartate amino-transferase, amylase, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase), glucose, creatinine, lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol) a cream formulation of CNs containing psiRNA cocktail was applied vaginally on days -6, -3 and 0. All the animals were inoculated intravaginally with SHIV SF162-p3 viral stock. infection significantly reduced the viral load of the treated monkeys by day 42. in the control monkeys, the viral load had plateaued following days 34 and 42. psi cocktail CNs were isolated from 200 l of the plasma. very little IL-6 was found in the BAL of pEGFP group compared to chitosan-complexed group. transmission electron micrographs of chitosan, Lipofectamine and CN complexed with pEGFP. the screening led to the identification of siRNA plasmids that gave at least a three-log decrease in p24 titers. the results showed significant reductions in p24 titers with individual psiRNAs. when psiCXCR4 and psiCCR5 were used independently, there was no significant decrease in viral titers. human PBMC cultures grown in 12-well plates were incubated with a single dose (1 g/1million cells) with psiRNA cocktail with CNs (psicocktail) or pU6 vector control-CNs (pU6.con) or CNs alone without any plasmids (Virus) the virus was removed 2 h after the infection by centrifugation, the cells washed and fresh medium was added. cells in the 3D-VEC model were transfected with either chitosan or Lipofectamine 2000 or chlipid nanocomplexes. at 48 h post-transfection, the tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. sections were immunostained using anti-Ki67 antibody tagged with Alexa Fluor 555. supernatants were collected on days 0, 2, 3 and titrated for p24 concentration (pg/ml) using a p24-ELISA. supernatants were co-transfected with cocktail plasmid siRNAs-chlipid nanocomplexes or pU6 vector control-chlipid nanocomplexes or chlipid complexes alone with no plasmids. serum (3 ml) and CVL (5 ml) fluid were collected from all rabbits. none of the cells from rabbit lavages treated with cream alone or cream plus CNs showed no neutrophil infiltration. the results suggest that treatment with chitosan nanoparticles did not cause toxicity in rhesus monkeys with respect to proteins (total protein, albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino-transferase, amylase, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase) 139.8 178.25 175.25 178.25 182.25 Calcium 10.0 9.9 9.8 9.4 10.25 9.9 10.025 9.85 Phosphorous 3.5 3.5 3.3 4.0 3.65 4.125 4.275 3.675 Sodium 149.8 147.5 151.8 154.3 146.25 147.75 151.75 155.25 Potassium 9.7 3.8 3.5 3.7 16.65 3.925 3.85 3.925 Chloride 108.3 108.5 plasma viral load was measured by PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results suggest administration of cocktail of plasmid siRNAs complexed with CNs significantly reduced the viral load of the treated monkeys by day 42 of infection. tenofovir reduces the risk of HIV transmission in heterosexual women. tenofovir can be introduced into cells as synthetic doubled-stranded oligonucleotides. RNAi is a well-characterized phenomenon that has proven effective in silencing a number of genes of different viruses. siRNAs targeting viral proteins, especially regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev, would be good candidates for gene silencing in vivo. a cocktail of siRNAs targeting different HIV-1 gene sequences would be more likely to avoid HIV-1 mutant escape. a cocktail of siRNAs targeting different HIV-1 gene sequences would be more likely to avoid mutant escape. preclinical safety and efficacy testing of microbicide candidates involves a large number of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays and models. chitosan-based nanoparticles showed no significant toxicity in rhesus monkeys."}
