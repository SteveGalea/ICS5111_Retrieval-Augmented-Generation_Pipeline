{"summary": "270 samples from patients hospitalized with the respiratory infection during the autumn season of 2015 were evaluated for the presence of four HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HUK1 and NL63) 85% of positive samples were male with the range of age between 12- 75 years old. the study of HCoVs has been hampered by the difficulty in propagating these viruses in vitro. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are recognized to be an important cause of the common cold. 270 nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients were collected during October to December 2015 (9) the patients suffered from respiratory syndrome such as coughing, gasping, and excessive lacrimation. the range of age was between 12\u201375 years old. cDNA was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and 4\u00b0C for 1 min respectively. each reaction had a total volume of 25 L, including 12.5 L SYBR Green master mix, 200 nmol of each forward and reverse primers. 270 nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients were collected during October to December 2015 (9) the patients suffered from respiratory syndrome such as coughing, gasping, and excessive lacrimation. the range of age was between 12\u201375 years old. cDNA was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and 4\u00b0C for 1 min respectively. cDNA was stored at 20\u00b0C until use (10) coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, HUK-1 the only detected virus was 229E (5.5%, is positive samples) of positive samples for all three months, 85% were male with the range of age between 12- 75 years old. a new group betacoronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was found in 2 patients with pneumonia in Hong Kong. HCoV-OC43, HCoVNL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were specifically associated with lower respiratory tract disease in the study population (1). a cluster of 5 cases occurred in the same hospital in Kerman Province, Iran, during May\u2013July 2014 (16). eighty-three patients (32.5%) had viral pathogens: influenza in 25 (9.8%), parainfluenza in 19 (7.4%), rhinovirus in 15 (5.9%), adenovirus in 14 (5.9%), enterovirus in 5 (2%), and RSV in 4 (1.6%) and coinfection with two viruses in 1 patient (0.4%) (17). HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year (1). 43 (5.9%) of 734 patients with pneumonia had HCoV infections; 72.1% of the infections were with OC43. the results, however, indicate that HCoV is detected."}
