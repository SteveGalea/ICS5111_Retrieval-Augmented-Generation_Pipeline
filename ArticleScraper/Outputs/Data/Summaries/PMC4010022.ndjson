There was no evidence of disseminated HSV. her cause of death was determined to be herpes simplex viral hepatitis. ninety percent of patients with HSV hepatitis have a characteristic liver profile. anicteric hepatitis refers to a liver profile showing a significant increase in transaminases with a relatively normal or low bilirubin. there may be a marked elevation of AST greater than ALT. SV hepatitis leads to ALF in 74% of cases. mortality rate reaches up to 90%. early treatment with acyclovir should be strongly considered."}
