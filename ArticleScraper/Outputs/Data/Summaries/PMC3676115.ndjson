{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in humans are generally mild and self-limited. there was limited research on the tissue tropism and host response following human infection with coronaviruses. a novel coronavirus was detected in two patients from Saudi Arabia and Qatar (10, 11) retrospective investigation of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in Zarqa, Jordan, in April 2012 (14) confirmed that at least some of these cases were also caused by human betacoronavirus lineage C virus EMC (HCoV-EMC) some have given a history of contact with animals (e.g., camels and sheep) (13), and a zoonotic origin of the infection is considered likely. we have previously used ex vivo cultures of human bronchial and lung tissue to study the tissue tropism, virus replication kinetics, apoptosis, and immune responses of HCoV-EMC infection. we now use ex vivo cultures of human bronchial and lung tissue to study the tissue tropism, virus replication kinetics, apoptosis, and innate immune responses of HCoV-EMC infection. all the experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 biocontainment facility at the university of Hong Kong. 96-well tissue culture plates of the respective cells were used for the virus titration assay for HCoV-EMC and HCoV-229E (MRC-5 cells) the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were replenished with MEM with 2% FBS and 1% mal tissues were infected with HCoV-229E, HCoV-EMC, and SARS-CoV. the cells were infected with HCoV-229E, HCoV-EMC, and HPAI H5N1 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) after 1 h of virus adsorption at 37\u00b0C, the virus inoculum was removed. RNA was amplified in 25-l reaction mixture containing 1 l SSIII-Taq enzyme mix. 12.5 l of 2 reaction buffer, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.4 M forward primer upE-Fwd (5\u2032-GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT-3\u2032), 0.4 M reverse primer upE-Rev (5\u2032-GCCTCTACACGGGACCCAT). expression of the HCoV-EMC gene was expressed as the fold change compared to its expression at 1 hpi. expression profiles for proinflammatory cytokines were quantified by real-time qPCR analysis. expression profiles for proinflammatory cytokines were also quantified. the gene for BtCoV HKU5 N protein was inserted into the VEE virus replicon plasmid pVR21 by overlap PCR. the replicon particles (VRP-HKU5 N protein) were packaged, and titers were determined on baby hamster kidney cells as previously described (33, 34) five-week-old mice were immunized with 105 infectious units (IU) of VRP-HKU5 N protein in a 10-l volume the reaction of the primary antibody was revealed by the use of biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500; 115-065-146; Jackson) antibodies to CD68 for macrophages, AE1/AE3 for epithelial cells, -tubulin (F-2043; Sigma) for ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, and podoplanin for type I pneumocytes were used for double labeling. antiviral effect of interferon treatment in ex vivo human lung tissue. recombinant IFN- (PHC4014; Invitrogen) and IFN- (PHC4244; Invitrogen) were reconstituted into 1,000 U/ml of F12K medium with 1% PS. preinfection and postinfection administration regimes were applied. human betacoronavirus of lineage C virus (HCoV-EMC) was obtained from Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. HCoV-EMC produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) within 1 to 2 days after infection of Vero cells. the plates were observed for a CPE daily for 5 days. the viral dilution leading to a CPE in 50% of inoculated wells was estimated by using the Karber method, designated 1 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) TCID50 assay for HCoV-229E, HCoV-EMC, and influenza type A virus at 1, 24, and 48 hpi. tissues were collected at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hpi for RNA extraction and at 24, 48, and 72 hpi for fixation in 10% formalin or 2.5% glutaraldehyde for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. RNA extraction was carried out using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was eluted in 50 l RNase-free water. the reaction mixtures were first incubated at 55\u00b0C for 20 min. gene expression profiles for proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and the housekeeping gene were quantified by real-time qPCR analysis. expression of these genes was normalized by using the product of the -actin housekeeping gene mRNA. serum was collected by tail nick and used in immunohistochemistry analysis. antiserum against the N protein was found to cross-react with the HCoV-EMC nucleocapsid protein. antibody was raised against coronavirus HKU5 N glycoprotein (1:200) HCoV-EMC was detected using a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) the stained preparations were examined using a Nikon Ni immunofluorescence microscope. images were captured using a SPOT Slider 2-megapixel camera. infected culture was replenished with culture medium with 1,000 U/ml of IFN. control lung tissue cultures without any IFN were used for comparison. supernatants from infected lung tissue explant cultures were collected at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. HCoV-229E did not detectably infect or replicate in bronchial tissues. in ex vivo cultures of human lung tissue, viral antigen was not detected in HCoV-229E-inoculated tissues. no productive replication was observed in HCoV-229E-inoculated tissues. HCoV-EMC cell tropism in human bronchial and lung tissues. infected cells were not colocalized with these two major cell types in the bronchus. viral antigen was found in nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells. macrophages, epithelial cells, and type I pneumocytes stained with specific markers. HCoV-EMC did not costain with macrophages, but there was staining with AE1/AE3 marker. cellular morphology and immunohistochemistry for viral antigen (nucleoprotein) in HCoV-EMC-infected lung tissues. virions were identified intracellularly, but large aggregates of virions in intracytoplasmic secretory vesicles were not conspicuous. the bronchus and lung were type II pneumocytes with visible lamellar bodies. apoptotic cells identified in human lung tissue ex vivo culture. ex vivo culture of lung tissue mock infected (A) or infected with HCoV-EMC or SARS-CoV (C) at 48 hpi. HCoV-EMC infection in bronchial and lung tissues failed to induce IFN- or TNF- (Fig. 5B and D) there was marginal induction of IL-29 in virus-infected lung tissue cultures at 48 hpi (P 0.05) and higher IP-10 mRNA expression at 24 hpi compared with that for mock-infected bronchial tissue (P 0.05) the bar chart shows the mean and standard error of mean numbers of copies of mRNA per 105 -actin copies from three independent experiments. we quantitated viral RNA and host type I and III IFN, TNF-, and IP-10 mRNA in cells of the alveolar epithelial cell line A549. expression of HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, and influenza H5N1 virus genes expressed as the fold change compared with that at 1 hpi. IFNs inhibit HCoV-EMC replication in ex vivo lung tissue cultures. a significant decrease in replication kinetics of HCoV-EMC was observed. the human lung ex vivo cultures were infected with 106 TCID50s/ml of HCoV-EMC or SARS-CoV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a control culture consisting of F12K medium plus 1% PS (black bars) or culture medium with IFN- (white bars) or IFN- (gray bars) was used to replenish the medium at 1 hpi. supernatants were collected from infected cultures at 1, in ex vivo cultures of human lung tissue, viral antigen was not detected in HCoV-229E-inoculated tissues. HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV extensively infected and replicated in the lung parenchymal tissues. HCoV-EMC was stained with vector red (red) and cell markers conjugated with FITC (green) for detection of -tubulin (ciliated cell marker) and MUC5AC (goblet cell marker) in bronchial tissue. human coronavirus N protein (stained in reddish brown and marked with red arrows) was identified in endothelial cells at 24 hpi. thelial cells, and type I pneumocytes were stained with the specific markers CD68 (Fig. 2C), AE1/AE3 (Fig. 2D), and podoplanin (Fig. 2E) the principal target cells of HCoV-EMC infection were of epithelial origin, and focal colocalization was found in type I pneumocytes. s of virions in intracytoplasmic secretory vesicles showed enveloped viral particles from 75 to 85 nm in diameter. apoptosis in HCoV-EMC-infected human lung tissue ex vivo cultures. ex vivo culture of lung tissue mock infected (A) or infected with HCoV-EMC (B) or SARS-CoV (C) at 48 hpi. reddish brown stain identifies presence of cleaved caspase 3. RNA was quantitated by RT-PCR. there was marginal induction of IL-29 in virus-infected lung tissue cultures at 48 hpi (P 0.05) and higher IP-10 mRNA expression at 24 hpi compared with that for mock-infected bronchial tissue (P 0.05) there was no upregulation of these genes detected in bronchial or lung tissues infected with HCoV-EMC. viral RNA and host type I and III IFN, TNF-, and IP-10 mRNA in cells of the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 infected with HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, and HPAI H5N1 virus. none of these cytokines were induced by HCoV-EMC infection of A549 cells. 5N1 virus genes expressed as the fold change compared with that at 1 hpi. HCoV-EMC-, SARS-CoV-, and influenza H5N1 virus-infected A549 cells at 1, 24, and 48 hpi. the human lung ex vivo cultures were infected with 106 TCID50s/ml of HCoV-EMC or SARS-CoV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a control culture consisting of F12K medium plus 1% PS (black bars) or culture medium with IFN- (white bars) was used to replenish the medium at 1 hpi. the tropism and replication competence of HCoV-EMC in human lung and bronchus suggest that HCoV-EMC replicates at least as well as or even better than SARS-CoV in human lung and bronchial tissues. this suggests that HCoV-EMC replicates at least as well as or even better than SARS-CoV in human lung and bronchial tissues. nasopharyngeal tissue cultures infected with HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, or HCoV-EMC have been shown to infect the nasal mucosa of humans. more systematic investigations of HCoV-EMC in ex vivo cultures would provide further information on the tropism of this virus. olar epithelial cells and type I and type II pneumocytes appear to be the major targets for HCoV-EMC infection. a preliminary study of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages also showed that these cells did not support the replication of HCoV-EMC. mechanisms that contribute to pathogenesis of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV and avian influenza A H5N1 virus include direct virus replication-induced cell apoptosis, nec IFN therapy has been shown to have therapeutic potential in SARS-CoV infections using in vitro (42) and nonhuman primate (24) models. some trend toward clinical benefit was observed in human studies that were based on retrospective controls. both IFN- and IFN- significantly suppressed viral replication. ex vivo bronchial or lung tissue cultures showed that HCoV-EMC is a weak inducer of IFNs and that IFNs can inhibit replication of HCoV-EMC in HAE cultures. results support and extend observations using human bronchial tissue cultured ex vivo."}
