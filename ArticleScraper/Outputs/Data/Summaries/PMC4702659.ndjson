{"summary": "PRRSV is a positive-stranded RNA virus within the family Arteriviridae. it is the major etiological agent for pig reproductive failure and respiratory distress in swine farms. the rapid evolution of this virus has led to the emergence of many virulent strains, exemplified by MN184 strains. these molecules are composed of a heavy chain (HC) and a light chain (2-microglobulin [2m]) that normally form a heterodimer to present antigen peptides to the cell surface to activate CD8+ T cells. during a million years of coevolution, viruses have evolved strategies to evade this immunity (27\u201330) inactivated HP-PRRSV was obtained through UV irradiation at 75 mJ/cm2 for 1 h by using a low-pressure mercury vapor discharge lamp. inactivation of infectivity was confirmed on new monolayers of Marc-145 cells. mouse anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) MAb (catalogue number 66002-1-Ig) was obtained from proteintech. mouse anti-SLA-I molecule MAb JM1E3 (catalogue number MCA2261GA), mouse IgG1 negative-control antibody (catalogue number MCA928) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated JM1E3 (catalogue number MCA2261F) were nsp1 point mutation mutants (C76S/H146Y and C8S/C10S/C25S/C28S) were generated by in vitro synthesis of the whole gene fragment carrying the corresponding mutations. cloned into pCMV-HA to generate pHA-Nsp1(M-PCP) and pHA-Nsp1(M-NZF) total of 2 105 cells were used for staining with MAb JM1E3 (2 g/ml) in PBS\u20131% BSA for 30 min at 0\u00b0C, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 30 min at 0\u00b0C. a mouse IgG1 negative-control antibody was used as the isotype control. cells were ted at 37\u00b0C in the presence of FITC-conjugated MAb JM1E3. a total of 1 104 cells were analyzed. recombinant viruses were rescued by cotransfection. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with 10 M MG132 or DMSO. the cells were precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. the beads were washed three times with NP-40 buffer for 10 min each. cells were stained with mouse monoclonal antibody to HA (sigma) and Myc-2m stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the c-Myc epitope for 1 h at RT in a humid chamber. nuclear DNA was stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes) the Marc-145 cell line, the human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cell line, and its derivative clone HEK 293FT were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) we used passage 8 viruses for all experiments in this study. DMSO was used to dissolve both Z-VAD-FMK and MG132. Rabbit polyclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was obtained from Abcam. mouse anti-sLA-I molecule MAb JM1E3 (catalogue number MCA2261GA), mouse IgG1 negative-control antibody (catalogue number MCA928) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC plasmids pFLAG-SLA-I-HC, pMyc-SLA-I-HC, and pMyc-2m were cloned into the eukaryotic vector pCMV-HA. nsp1 point mutation mutants (C76S/H146Y and C8S/C10S/C25S/C28S) were generated by in vitro synthesis of the whole gene fragment carrying the corresponding mutations. a total of 2 105 cells were used for staining with MAb JM1E3 (2 g/ml) in PBS\u20131% BSA for 30 min at 0\u00b0C, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 30 min at 0\u00b0C. a mouse antibody was used as the isotype control. the cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h with a saturating amount of unlabeled MAb JM1E3. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse. HEK 293T cells were either singly or doubly transfected with plasmids carrying SLA-I and nsp1 or its derivatives. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells then treated with 10 M MG132 or DMSO, as indicated, for 12 h. p1 and its derivatives were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA. cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab\u2032)2 fragment or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) 99% of the cells became infected at 8 h postinfection, as evidenced by an indirect-immunofluorescence assay with a mouse monoclonal antibody to N protein. at 16 h postinfection, most of the cells were dead and detached from the plate. at 16 h postinfection, most of the cells were still viable. at 12 h postinfection, the SLA-I level decreased even further. at 12 h postinfection, the SLA-I level decreased even further. at the indicated time points, the virus-induced CPE was monitored. infected cells were gently washed three times with 1 PBS to remove dead cells. the cells were incubated with saturating amounts of unlabeled MAb JM1E3 to SLA-I at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then at 37\u00b0C for various times before being subjected to FACS analysis with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the trend curves were fitted based on the MFIs. PRRSV HB-1/3.9 infection also resulted in a decrease of SLA-I cell surface accumulation to an extent similar to that with JXwn06. a difference in the staining pattern will reflect the effect of PRRSV infection on the endocytosis rate. PRRSV- or mock-inoculated cells were incubated with saturating amounts of unlabeled MAb JM1E3 to SLA-I at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then at 37\u00b0C for various times before being subjected to FACS analysis with FITC-conjugated JM1E3. this suggests that HP-PRRSV infection might inhibit SLA-I export. PRRSV infection resulted in a dramatic drop in the overall abundance of SLA-I-HC molecules. the accumulation of 2m protein was also reduced but to a lesser extent than the SLA-I-HC chain. the effect of PRRSV on SLA-I started at least 8 h after infection. mock- or PRRSV-infected PAMs were either mock infected or infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1 or 0.1. at 12 h postinfection, cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using antibodies against SLA-I-HC, 2m, N protein, and -actin. molecular-weight species representing SLA-I-HC in PRRSV-infected PAMs. ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes SLA-I degradation. cells were either mock infected or infected with HP-PRRSV. fected PAMs were treated with a pancaspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (200 M), or DMSO. at 12 h postinfection, cells were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. this led to the cleavage of PARP, an indication of active apoptosis. however, the addition of a caspase inhibitor blocked the cleavage of this molecule. nsp1 has been shown to contain three domains: an N-terminal zinc finger domain (ZF-N), a papain-like cysteine protease domain (PCP) and a C-terminal extension (CTE) at 48 h postransduction, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. the cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies against FLAG, HA, and -actin. the data are representative of results from three independent experiments. the double mutations were used to inactivate the cysteine protease activity. nsp1(M-NZF) mutant lost ability to degrade the SLA-I-HC chain. this indicates that the zinc finger is critical for nsp1 function. similar results were observed for 2m (Fig. 7C) we coexpressed nsp1 or its derivatives with FLAG\u2013SLA-I-HC or Myc-2m in HEK 293T cells. this is most likely due to the degradation of FLAG\u2013SLA-I-HC molecules by nsp1. nsp1 mutant showed a phenotype similar to that of wild-type nsp1. similar results were obtained for the interaction between nsp1 and 2m. nsp1 was able to interact with SLA-I in in vitro assays. but it was not clear whether it actually interacts with SLA-I in vivo. al cysteine residues (M-NZF) altered the localization pattern of nsp1. they responded to each other and became colocalized, suggesting that the mutations do not affect the interaction between SLA-I and nsp1. together, these results suggest that nsp1 is capable of interacting with SLA-I molecules within mammalian cells. mmunofluorescence assay with a mouse monoclonal antibody to N protein (data not shown) however, the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) did not become apparent until 16 h postinfection. trypan blue staining indicated that the PAMs were still viable up to 12 h following infection. at 16 h postinfection, most of the cells were dead and detached from the plate. PAMs were mock infected or infected with HP-PRRSV JXwn06 or UV-irradiated JXwn06 or HB-1/3.9 at an MOI of 1 or 0.1. at the indicated time points, the cells were harvested and subjected to FACS analysis with mouse monoclonal antibody against SLA-I (JM1E3) HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 was first UV irradiated at a lethal dose. then used to infect PAMs at an MOI of 1 for 12 h before being subjected to FACS analysis. we tested whether the effect on SLA-I is dose dependent. PRRSV- or mock-inoculated cells were incubated with saturating amounts of unlabeled MAb JM1E3 to SLA-I at 4\u00b0C for 1 h before being washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound MAbs. a difference in the staining pattern will reflect the effect of PRRSV infection on the endocytosis rate. HP-PRRSV infection reduces overall SLA-I abundance in infected PAMs. it is conceivable that PRRSV infection might cause retention of SLA-I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi network or target them for degradation. HP-PRRSV reduces the overall SLA-I abundance in infected PAMs. cells were either mock infected or infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1 or 0.1. at 12 h postinfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. MG132 was used at a relatively low level (5 m) to minimize its toxicity to PAMs. the addition of DMSO did not have an effect on the accumulation of SLA-I molecules in PRRSV-infected cells. mock- or PRRSV-infected PAMs were treated with MG132. the proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies to SLA-I-HC, 2m, or ubiquitin (Ub) at 12 h postinfection, cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. nsp1, a viral replicase protein, showed marked activity against SLA-I. overexpression of nsp1 in the PAM cell line 3D4/21 led to substantial decreases in the abundances of both SLA-I HC and 2m. overexpression of nsp1 also led to a reduced level of endogenous SLA-I in PK-15 cells. HEK 293T cells were transfected to express FLAG\u2013SLA-I-HC (B) or Myc-2m (C) together with either HA-nsp1 or its truncation mutants. at 36 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against FLAG, HA, and -actin. nsp1(M-NZF) mutant showed a phenotype similar to that of wild-type (WT) nsp1 (Fig. 7B, lane 3), suggesting that the zinc finger is critical for nsp1 function. nsp1(M-NZF) mutant lost ability to degrade the SLA-I-HC chain. similar results were observed for 2m (Fig. 7C) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were either subjected to direct Western blot analyses (B, left, C, and D, left) or immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (B) or Myc (D) antibodies. nsp1 also interacts with both chains of SLA-I for the purpose of degradation. nsp1(M-PCP) mutant showed a phenotype similar to that of wild-type nsp1. the quadruple mutations did not block the interaction between nsp1 and SLA-I-HC. nsp1 was able to interact with SLA-I in in vitro assays. nsp1 was localized to sites that resemble the structures of the ER or Golgi compartments. nsp1 became punctate and colocalized with SLA-I-HC. similar results were observed for the interaction between 2m and nsp1. studies of the interplay between SLA-I and PRRSV are highly relevant to our understanding of immune evasion mechanisms of this pathogen. infection by this virus fails to trigger a strong innate immune response that is always key for the successful control or clearance of pathogens. nsp1 is a multifunctional protein and important for multiple events in the life cycle of PRRSV. mutations that block the cleavage of nsp1 have been shown to be lethal to the virus. mutations have revealed that nsp1 plays a critical role in regulation of sgmRNA synthesis. deletion of this region leads to abolished viral sgmRNA synthesis. the third function of nsp1 is to modulate interferon signaling. nsp1 also targets SLA-I for degradation. authors did not use MG132 to stabilize CBP before immunoprecipitation. integrity of the N-terminal zinc finger domain was not required for the interaction with SLA-I but rather was linked to protein degradation. viruses encode ubiquitin E3 ligases so they can directly conjugate ubiquitin to the substrate. future studies will be directed to identifying the specific cellular binding partner(s) in this pathway for nsp1 in order to further dissect its mechanism. the past 20 years of studies have proven that PRRSV is a tough pathogen to tackle. nsp1 is important for multiple events in the life cycle of PRRSV. mutations that block the cleavage of nsp1 have been shown to be lethal to the virus. nsp1 plays a critical role in regulating viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis. nsp1 modulates interferon signaling by promoting the degradation of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a nuclear factor that is involved in the transcriptional coactivation of many transcriptional factors. this leads to the suppression of promoter activity of many transcriptional factors (NF-b and IRF3, etc.) some viruses encode ubiquitin E3 ligases so that they can directly conjugate ubiquitin to the substrate. some viruses encode proteins that can recruit either E3 ligases or associated components to the complex to mediate the degradation of their substrates. eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of diverse E3 ligases as well as associated components (62) in this pathway for nsp1. future vaccine design may be directed to engineer nsp1 mutants to improve cell-mediated immunity by blocking its interaction with SLA-I."}
