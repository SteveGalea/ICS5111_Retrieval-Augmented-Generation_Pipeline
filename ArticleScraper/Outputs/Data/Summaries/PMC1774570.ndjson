{"summary": "all group 1b coronaviruses encode a single accessory protein between the spike and envelope genes except for human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. the prototype virus has a split gene, encoding the putative ORF4a and ORF4b proteins. the genome RNA is 27 \u2013 32 Kb in size, capped and polyadenylated. the virions are 80 \u2013 150 nm in diameter and have a unique morphology. coVs are classified into three groups based on phylogenetic and serological relationships. the functions of coronavirus accessory proteins are largely unknown. reverse genetic analyses of mouse hepatits Virus (MHV) and filine infectious peritonitis Virus (FIPV) suggest that they are not required for virus replication. PEDV and TGEV acquire truncated forms of their accessory proteins after extensively passaging in cell culture. these laboratory-adapted strains, encoding truncated forms of ORF3-proteins, are less pathogenic than the corresponding wild-type strains. the HCoV-229E full-length genomic sequence has been determined from a cell culture-adapted virus more than 30 years after the initial isolation of HCoV-229E. we hypothesized that HCoV-229E ORFs 4a/b might actually have been a single ORF that was truncated upon adaptation of HCoV-229E to cell culture. RT-PCR sequencing analysis of the ORF4a/b region revealed an overall nucleotide similarity of 97% of the Dutch clinical isolates to that of the cell culture-adapted viruses. of most interest is the presence of a 2-nucleotide deletion within the ORF4a gene of the cell culture-adapted viruses when aligned to the Dutch isolates. gnosis RIVM 02-034 52 2002 Yes No No No No No No No No No No No No Hoarse No Common Cold, Acute tonsillitis RIVM 03-224 68 2003 Yes No No No No No Respiratory allergy No Common Cold RIVM 04-037 54 2004 Yes Yes Yes Yes - No Dyspnoea Yes Exacerbation of COPD CCU-T935 U 1986 U U U U U U U U U U U U HC-LP was initially isolated in 1965 and HC-Killick in the eighties. the third sample, CCU-T935, was obtained from an infected person that participated trial T935 in 1986. the sequences of ORF4a/b from the three early isolates were indeed more related to the cell culture-adapted, prototype viruses (98 \u2013 99%) than to the current Dutch isolates (98%). VR-740TM encodes two ORFs between the S and E genes. denotes identical amino acid to the RIVM 04-037 sequence; \"*\" denotes stopcodon. clinical isolates encode a single, uninterrupted ORF between the S and E genes. this single accessory gene is 660 nucleotides in length and encodes an ORF4 protein that is 219 amino acids in size. all Dutch sequences have the same amino acid sequence (Figure 2). our data suggest that the deletion in the laboratory HCoV-229E strain and VR-740TM is the result of cell culture-adaptation. the deletion may represent natural variation between different HCoV-229E isolates. however, the early isolate sequences of CCU-T935 and HC-Killick do not contain the 2-nucleotide deletion, but carry the uninterrupted ORF between S and E. deletion was observed that is located halfway the ORF4a region. a large fragment is deleted in the cell-culture adapted HC-LP virus. the deletion of accessory genes resulted in these cases in viruses that are attenuated in vivo. it is of interest to investigate whether an HCoV-229E strain with a more severe truncated or a non-truncated ORF4 gene can replicate in these mice. it is of interest to investigate whether an HCoV-229E strain with a more severe truncated or a non-truncated ORF4 gene can replicate in these mice. we also observed several non-silent nucleotide differences between the cell culture-adapted the genome organization of this wild-type Bt-CoVs is similar to that of the other group 1b members, with exception of one putative gene at the 3'end of the genome. the ORF3 protein of Bt-CoV/512/2005 is homologous to ORF3 proteins of PEDV, HCoV-NL63 and the ORF4 protein from our clinical HCoV-229E isolates. the HCoV-229E ORF4 protein is highly conserved among clinical isolates suggesting that the protein plays an important role during in vivo infection. the amino acid sequence of the HCoV-229E ORF4 protein is highly conserved among clinical isolates. sequences were directly sequenced with primers 3'-229E-ORF4ab, 5'-229E-ORF4ab, 5'-229E-ORF4ab, 5'229E-ORF4abNested, 5'229E4int (5'-GCA ACT TTG ATT GCT G-'3) and 3'229E4int (5'-GTC CTC TAA GAG CAA C-'3). data deposition The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited under the Genbank database accession numbers EF198671\u2013EF198679. collection of patient material Patient materials were collected at the department of Medical Microbiology, Academic Medical Center (VS03-099) and from the Laboratory for Infectious Diseases and Screening, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands (RIVM02-034, RIVM02-041, RIVM03-224 and ORF4ab, 5'-229E-ORF4abNested, 5'229E4int (5'-GCA ACT TTG ATT GCT G-'3) and 3'229E4int (5'-GTC CTC TAA GAG CAA C-'3) sequence reaction was preformed without purifying steps, according to the BigDye\u00ae terminator V1.1 cycle sequencing manufacturer's protocol. the RIVM isolates were collected by the general practitioners from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research. the RIVM isolates were collected within the framework of national surveillance of acute respiratory tract infections."}
