{"summary": "RT-PCR on NPA became available to us in mid-March. we included 218 patients who had nasopharyngeal RT-PCR performed at illness onset. NPA samples were examined by rapid immunofluorescence antigen detection methods. 4.2 L of eluted RNA was reverse-transcribed with use of reverse transcriptase. mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then at 42\u00b0C for 15 min. reaction was stopped at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then chilled in ice. treatment All patients received treatment according to a standard protocol. an antiviral drug (ribavirin 24 mg/kg/day intravenously, together with hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg/day) administered if symptoms did not respond within 48 h. patients Two hundred sixty-seven patients fulfilling CDC case definition for suspected or probable SARS were admitted to the isolation wards of the Princess Margaret Hospital from February 26, 2003 to March 31, 2003.

two were Indonesian. twenty-one of the patients (10%) were healthcare workers. samples from 156 patients (71.6%) were positive. the optimal time for sample collection was day 8\u201310. no significant difference in the mean sampling time was found between RT-PCR\u2013positive and \u2013negative patients. positive RT-PCR for coronavirus n=156 (%) p value Time from symptoms onset to sample collection (days) 4.5 2.2 4.2 2.4 0.366 Fever 155 (99) 60 (97) 0.139 Chill 120 (77) 51 (82.3) 0.388 Malaise 103 (66) 34 (54.8) 30 (48.4) 0.467 Cough 66 (42.3) 27 (43.5) 0.867 Rigor 65 (41.7) 27 (43.5) 0. heart rate 95 14 98 16 0.571 Systolic blood pressure 127 18 130 19 0.503 Diastolic blood pressure 71 11 73 12 0.450 Laboratory findings upon admission Hemoglobin level (g/dL) 13.3 1.4 13.0 1.6 0.160 Leukocyte count (x 109/L) 5.5 2.7 5.5 1.9 0.954 Neutrophil count (x 109/L) 4.3 2.6 4.2 2.3 0.885 Lymphocyte count ( 74 patients (85.1%) had total antibodies detected by IFA. serologic tests for 25 patients (75.8%) in the RT-PCR\u2013negative group were positive. clinical progress/outcome Positive RT-PCR for coronavirus n=156 (%) p value Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 46 (29.5) 6 (9.7) 0.002 Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 38 (24.4) 5 (8.1) 0.008a Patients developing acute renal failure 8 (5.1) 1 (1.6) 0.451a Death 20 (12.8) 2 (3.2) 0.044a aFisher exact test was applied if number was 5;

95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 38.0. the clinical features of our cohort were rather nonspecific. anemia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were common on admission. symptoms might reflect peripheral consumption or bone marrow suppression by the infection. sensitivity of stool samples for RT-PCR tests was 97% (mean of 14.2 days). in patients with negative RT-PCR results on NPA samples, none had a stool sample positive by RT-PCR. negative result may not represent low viral load in patients and vice versa. the maximum viral replication by quantitative RT-PCR occurred by approximately day 10. but the clinical worsening seemed to lag behind this peak. a positive RT-PCR result had no correlation to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. sensitivity of RT-PCR test was 74.7% when an antibody test was used as a standard, which can be explained by the variation in the technique and timing of sampling. the optimal timing for the RT-PCR test is unknown. the controversy of medication in the management of SARS has never been settled. current treatment guidelines proposed by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong are still in use despite the adverse effects of the suggested treatment."}
