{"summary": "the alphavirus particle is 70 nm in diameter and contains a nucleocapsid core embedded with 80 trimeric spikes. each spike is made up of three E1-E2 envelope protein heterodimers. this leads to a sequence of events starting with dissociation of the E1-E2 dimer and conformational changes in the E1 membrane fusion protein. the low-pH-mediated fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a common theme in many enveloped viruses. the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin requires the low pH of the endosome for rearrangement and exposure of its fusion peptide (7). the acidic environment of the endosome also induces conformational changes in the flavivirus E glycoprotein (8). OLX is an anticancer compound that antagonizes the prosurvival Mcl-1 protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family of proteins. it triggers apoptosis in cancer cells by occupying a hydrophobic pocket in the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-2 proteins. OLX inhibits IAV entry and uptake by inhibiting Mcl-1. OLX has previously been shown to act as a novel antiviral drug with activity against different alphaviruses. in the same study, OLX at a low concentration of 0.3 M was suggested to be effective against SINV but not against SFV (20) OLX is a potent inhibitor of alphaviruses and dose dependently reduces viral titers and levels of RNA and protein synthesis even in a high-MOI setting. BHK-21 cells were infected with wild-type SFV, SINV, and CHIKV at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 6 h. blot analysis was done using probes specific to the 3\u2032 UTR of the CHIKV genome. blot analysis was done using probes specific to the 3\u2032 UTR of the CHIKV genome. the results are representative of those from two independent experiments. OLX showed time-dependent and cell type-specific toxicity, with Huh 7.5 cells treated for 18 h being the most sensitive (CC50 = 13.3 M; Table 1). HOS cells were the least affected by OLX treatment and had a high CC50 value after 16 h of treatment (102.8 M; Table 1) OLX was added at 2 h and 4 h p.i. for SFV, OLX was added at 4 h and 8 h p.i. for CHIKV, the compound was added at 4 h and 8 h p.i. and the cell culture supernatants were collected 14 h p.i. OLX was present at 0.5 M for different times indicated for SFV (A) and CHIKV (B) infections. titers were compared to those of the untreated controls to obtain the log reduction in titers. SFV-ts9 has a single point mutation in nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2; G389R) that results in multiple enzymatic defects in the N-terminal region of the protein and prevents replication at the elevated temperature of 39\u00b0C. SFV-ts9 was coupled with an Rluc reporter (SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc) OLX inhibited virus entry to a lesser extent when it was added at 60 min p.i. than when it was added at the same time or 15 min p.i. the entry defect happens rapidly during 15 min of treatment. the autofluorescent nature of OLX precluded any reliable conclusions from experiments using fluorescent pH-sensitive dyes. instead, we used the vital stain neutral red for protonation and incorporation into acidic compartments, like lysosomes. the degree of incorporation is inversely proportional to the lysosomal pH (27). infected cells were treated with 2.3 mM neutral red in cell culture medium devoid of pH indicator for 3 h, followed by treatment with 0.1% DMSO or 0.5 M OLX. images were captured using a charge-coupled-device camera mounted on an inverted light microscope. cells were prechilled on ice for 10 min, followed by addition of the viral inoculum (SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell) the viral inoculum was then aspirated, and cell-bound virus was pulsed with buffer at pH 5.5 for 15 min at 39\u00b0C. the acidic buffer was replaced with neutral-buffered medium. BHK-21 cells were infected with wild-type SFV at a low MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 16 h in the presence or absence of 0.5 M OLX. these parameters were selected to allow sufficient time for escape mutants to arise. dilutions were performed after every fifth passage to check for phenotypic resistance. values are represented as the fold increment in the viral titers compared to the wild type for DMSO-treated and OLX-treated samples. data are presented as means SEMs (n = 2). recombinant viruses contained only the nsP2 mutations (designated the EV mutant), only the E1 mutations (designated the LS mutant) or all four mutations (designated the EVLS mutant) were constructed. all mutant viruses grew to higher titers (2- to 6-fold) than the wild type. a dose-response entry assay was performed in the absence of OLX. we observed a more than 2-fold increase in the absolute luciferase signals for all three mutant combinations (LS, L, and S) compared to that for wild-type SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc. the virus containing only the L369I mutation was less sensitive to OLX. BHK-21 cells were infected with SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for 3 h at 39\u00b0C. neither TW-32 nor ABT-199 inhibited the luciferase signals in this assay. at 3 h p.i., cells were lysed and luciferase levels were measured. values are expressed in relative luciferase units compared to number of luciferase units for untreated samples. OLX showed >30-fold higher EC50s for the pH-insensitive picornaviruses CV-A9, E-6, and E-7 than for the flaviviruses. obatoclax is an antiviral with activity against different alphaviruses. OLX at a low concentration of 0.3 M was suggested to be effective against SINV but not against SFV (20) in the same study, we tested the activity of OLX against the reemerging CHIKV and used SINV and SFV as controls. OLX is an effective antiviral against alphaviruses. BHK-21 cells were infected with wild-type SFV, SINV, and CHIKV at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 6 h. the results are representative of those from two independent experiments. OLX inhibits alphaviruses in multiple cell types at submicromolar concentrations. we used reporter SFV and CHIKV expressing Renilla luciferase. inhibition of the luciferase signal served as a readout of antiviral activity. obatoclax is a novel antiviral with activity against alphaviruses and shows activity at submicromolar concentrations. obatoclax inhibits early stages of alphavirus replication. OLX was added at 2 h and 4 h p.i. and the cell culture supernatants were harvested 8 h p.i. for CHIKV, the compound was added at 4 h and 8 h p.i. for SFV, the compound was added at 4 h and 8 h p.i. and the cell culture supernatants were collected 14 h p.i. undiluted CHIKV stock was treated with 0.5 M OLX, 0.1% DMSO (negative control), or 0.1% disinfectant containing potassium peroxymonosulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sulfamic acid, and inorganic buffers. no such difference was seen with OLX treatment. SFV-ts9 has a single point mutation in nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2; G389R) that results in multiple enzymatic defects in the N-terminal region of the protein. SFV-ts9 was coupled with an Rluc reporter (SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc) and used to measure signals only from the initial RNA genomes. OLX, like bafilomycin A1, is an efficient inhibitor of SFV entry. the entry defect happens rapidly during 15 min of treatment of the cells. the autofluorescent nature of OLX precluded any reliable conclusions from experiments using fluorescent pH-sensitive dyes from being made. instead, we used the vital stain neutral red for protonation and incorporation into acidic compartments, like lysosomes. the degree of incorporation is inversely proportional to the lysosomal pH (27) prechilled cells were infected with SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell in neutral-buffered medium. plasma membrane fusion was triggered by replacing the virus inoculum with acid-buffered medium for 20 min at 39\u00b0C. cells were lysed and luciferase levels were measured. cell-bound virus was allowed to bind to the plasma membrane for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the acidic buffer was replaced with neutral-buffered medium. three different treatment schedules were used, where 0.5 M OLX or 50 nM bafilomycin A1 was present throughout the experiment. viral titers were estimated after the first passage, and subsequent passaging dilutions were adjusted to maintain approximately the same MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell in every passage. partial phenotypic resistance was seen after 30 rounds of passaging of SFV in the presence of OLX. BHK-21 cells were infected with wild-type SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc and SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc isolates containing an E1 mutation at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for 3 h at 39\u00b0C. at 3 h p.i., the cells were lysed and luciferase levels were measured. OLX presumably inhibits viral fusion by neutralizing the endosomal pH. all mutants were tested for phenotypic resistance using the same parameters. in DMSO-treated cells, all mutant viruses grew to higher titers (2- to 6-fold) than the wild type. a dose-response entry assay was performed with SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc cells infected with these SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc isolates at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell. the virus containing only the L369I mutation was less sensitive to OLX, with the EC50 for the virus with that mutation being 7-fold higher than that for the wild type (0.07 0.02 M) BHK-21 cells were infected with SFV-ts9\u2013Rluc at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for 3 h at 39\u00b0C. neither TW-32 nor ABT-199 inhibited the luciferase signals in this assay. we also assessed the ability of these Bcl-2 inhibitors to disrupt the endosomal acidic environment. luciferase signals were measured from quadruplicate wells. data are presented as means SEMs (n = 2). images were captured using a charge-coupled-device camera. OLX showed >30-fold higher EC50s for the pH-insensitive picornaviruses CV-A9, E-6, and E-7 than for the flaviviruses. selectivity indices were marginal (Table 2; Fig. S4). OLX is a synthetic indole bipyrrole derivative of bacterial prodigiosin. OLX was found to be effective against IAV at submicromolar concentrations (EC50 = 0.014 M) but was proposed to inhibit IAV entry or internalization by targeting Mcl-1 (20. OLX also inhibited other pH-dependent viruses of the Flaviviridae family at submicromolar concentrations. a time-of-addition assay with SFV-ts9 showed that the effect was maximal when cells were pretreated with OLX. inhibition was prevalent even when OLX was added at 15 min p.i. OLX brought about the rapid neutralization of the acidic environment in endosomes/lysosomes within 15 to 30 min of exposure. OLX induced lysosome clustering in some cell types, but in some others it affected the lysosomal pH without causing the obvious destruction of these organelles. the precise mechanism by which OLX brings about such a swift loss in lysosomal acidity remains to be determined. it took 30 rounds of passaging of SFV in the presence of OLX to obtain only partially resistant mutants. mutants with all three combinations of the E1 mutations appeared to have an increased fusogenic potential. presence of the S395R mutation seemed to dampen the effect of the L369I mutation. a 10-fold increase in the titer of the EV nsP2 mutant was also found when it was treated with OLX. Chloroquine, a known lysomotrophic agent, has anti-CHIKV activity at concentrations (range, 5 to 20 M) higher than those of OLX in vitro (11), but the possibility that it has therapeutic efficacy was not ruled out. further studies need to be performed in a suitable mouse model of CHIKV infection. toclax (Selleckchem), chlorpromazine (Calbiochem), bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), TW-37 (Selleckchem), ABT-199 (Selleckchem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at the concentration indicated above. wild-type SFV (47) and SINV (48) were derived from the respective wild-type clones. the icDNA of ZIKV was obtained by assembly of synthetic cDNA fragments (GenScript, USA) corresponding to the sequence of the ZIKV Asian genotype. the sequences of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) were not fully resolved in the published sequence of the isolate. cDNA clone 17D of YFV has been described earlier (52) prototype picornaviruses used in this study included coxsackievirus A9 (CV-A9; GenBank accession number D00627), echovirus 6 (E-6; GenBank accession number AY302558), and echovirus 7 (E-7; GenBank accession number AY036578). analysis of CHIKV protein expression was performed as described earlier (45). CHIKV genomic and subgenomic RNAs were detected using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe designed against the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genome. ninety-six-well white-bottom culture plates were seeded with BHK-21 cells, HOS cells, or Huh 7.5 cells. on the next day, the cells were infected with SFV-Rluc or CHIKV-Rluc at the MOIs indicated OLX was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 200 g/ml. cells were dissolved in isopropanol and colorimetric measurement was performed at an optical density of 562 nm. for infections with picornaviruses, cell viability was measured in parallel. d on 6-well plates were infected with the suspected resistant stocks in a 10-fold serial dilution format in the presence of 0.5 M OLX. the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and OLX was added to the cells at concentrations ranging from. the cells were infected with the viruses in five replicates for 1 h on ice. at 6 h p.i., they were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with virus type-specific antibodies. half-maximal (50%) effective and cytotoxic concentrations were determined using GraphPad Prism software. cDNA clones of wild-type SFV (47) and SINV (48) used in this study have been described earlier. wild-type CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY1) was generated from the infectious clone SP6-ICRES. the icDNA of ZIKV-UbiNanoLuc was obtained by assembly of synthetic cDNA fragments (GenScript, USA) corresponding to the sequence of the ZIKV Asian genotype. the sequences of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) were not fully resolved in the published sequence of the isolate. infectious cDNA clone 17D of YFV has been described earlier (52). prototype picornaviruses used in this study included coxsackievirus A9 (CV-A9; GenBank accession number D00627), echovirus 6 (E-6; GenBank accession number AY302558), and echovirus 7 (E-7; GenBank accession number AY036578). analysis of CHIKV protein expression was performed as described earlier (45). CHIKV genomic and subgenomic RNAs were detected using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe designed against the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genome. ninety-six-well white-bottom culture plates were seeded with BHK-21 cells, HOS cells, or Huh 7.5 cells. on the next day, the cells were infected with SFV-Rluc or CHIKV-Rluc at the MOIs indicated BHK-21 cells were treated with OLX at concentrations ranging from 20 M to 0.016 M. OLX was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 200 g/ml. cells were dissolved in isopropanol and colorimetric measurement was performed. BHK-21 cells seeded on 6-well plates were infected with the suspected resistant stocks in a 10-fold serial dilution format in the presence of 0.5 M OLX. after 1 h of adsorption, the virus inoculum was discarded, the cells were washed with PBS, and overlay medium containing minimal essential medium without phenol red, 1% Bacto agar, 4% FBS, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, aline, and OLX were added to the cells at concentrations ranging from 0.05 M to 4 M for 30 min. cells were infected with the viruses in five replicates for 1 h on ice."}
