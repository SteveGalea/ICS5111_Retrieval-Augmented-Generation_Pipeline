{"summary": "by may 2014, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV reported to the world health organization (WHO) was 632including 193 deaths. most of these cases were in the Middle East, followed by the united arab emirates. in approximately one-third of cases, at least one pre-existing chronic disease (e.g. cancer) was present, while in 29.6% of cases, the individual had come into direct contact with an infected person [5]. despite efforts to raise community awareness of the virus, the Saudi MOH has implemented a series of preventive measures. the development of an informative public health campaign should be guided by theoretical principles that have been well established [10]. the model defines the desired characteristics of an effective campaign message to maximize its effectiveness. input communication factors INPUT Factors include: 1 Source Demographics, credibility, attractiveness etc. 3 Channel Type of media used, i.e. television 4 Receiver Demographics, social/psychological factors 5 Destination Immediacy/delay, prevention/cessation Output persuasion techniques OUTPUT Description of what happens at each step: 1 Tuning in Exposure to the message 3 Liking Liking and being interested in the message 4 Comprehending Understanding the message 5 study included 658 men and women aged 18 years or over randomly selected from five regions of Riyadh. 196 refused to participate, while the rest provided oral consent. the average time needed to complete the survey was 7 min. source variables included participants\u2019 receptivity to a message from a number of sources (physician, health care workers, the MOH, friends, family, neighbors, mosque preachers and others) channel variables included the preferred modalities and locations for message dissemination, such as newspapers, local television, international television and radio. test was used to identify any significant variations in preferences for deriving information from a particular source, or disseminated via a particular channel/media type among this population. Statistical significance was defined at P 0.05. participants\u2019 previous knowledge of the virus (i.e. if they had ever heard of the virus\u2019s existence); their previous infection status (i.e. if they had experienced previous infection by the Corona virus); friends or family members who had been infected by the MERS-CoV. participants\u2019 estimate of the fatality rate (actual fatality rate of 30%) data analysis Descriptive statistics (mean SD) were calculated for all study variables (i.e. receiver characteristics and preferences), and percentages were determined for their various categories. chi-squared test was used to identify any significant variations in preferences for deriving information from a particular source. 92.4% were aware of the disease\u2019s \u2018person-to-person\u2019 mode of transmission. 86.6% were aware that the disease can be transmitted via droplets from coughing and sneezing. 98.2% confirmed that they had access to the internet from home. participants who reported that they were aware of the Corona virus were more likely to be unemployed (mostly women) or employed in the health care sector (2 = 90.3, P 0.001) Having a friend

in some receiver characteristics. physicians were preferred by those who resided in southern and western Riyadh. other health care workers were preferred by those who reported being worried about the Corona virus. the two messages that were tested were highly endorsed. the first message, \u2018Know the transmission mode of Corona virus: it will help you protect yourself and protect your family\u2019, was endorsed by 91.2% of participants. 74.6% expressed an interest in learning about the transmission modes of the virus. small percentages reported having visited outdoor public places

poor prevention behavior, and other harmful or reckless behaviors commonly found in younger age groups. social media and other information available on the internet may have affected individuals\u2019 attitudes toward preventative behavior for infectious disease control in Saudi Arabia. many participants remained unconvinced that Saudi reports about the disease were true, which created undue resistance, apathy and lack of interest to all interventions offered to the community. there is currently no literature related to cultural appropriateness of health communication messages in Saudi Arabia. the study supports the use of theory-driven approach in pre-campaign efforts to enhance the development of effective awareness campaigns for this population. conflict of interest statement
