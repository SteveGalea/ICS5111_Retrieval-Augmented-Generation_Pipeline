{"summary": "in eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major site where secreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized and folded. unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen and cause ER stress. to maintain homeostasis, signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded-protein response (UPR) are activated (1). BP1 (XBP1u) mRNA encodes an inhibitor of the UPR. XBP1s mRNA encodes a potent transcription activator, which translocates to the nucleus and enhances the expression of many UPR genes. ER homeostasis is a highly controlled mode of cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and nuclear fragmentation. ire1-XBP1 pathway inhibits apoptosis in late-stage infected cells. ire1 protected infected cells from IBV-induced apoptosis. the mechanism regulating this process remains largely unexplored. prosurvival kinase Akt was also modulated by IRE1 to promote cell survival during coronavirus infection. the egg-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV (ATCC VR-22) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and adapted to Vero cells. cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being infected with IBV at an MOI of approximately 2 or incubated with an equal volume of UV-IBV in serum-free medium. after 2 h of adsorption, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and kept incubating at 37\u00b0C before being harvested. the cDNA of human XBP1, unspliced isoform (RefSeq NM_005080.3) was amplified from total RNA of H1299 cells by RT-PCR using specific primers. the cDNA of human XBP1, unspliced isoform (RefSeq NM_005080.3), was amplified from total RNA of H1299 cells by RT-PCR using XBP1u-specific the PCR products of both XBP1u and XBP1s were digested with BglII and KpnI and inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) the forward primer 5\u2032-GGAAGATCTGGAGCTATGTGTG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CGGGGTACCTTATACCGCCAGAATCCATGGGGGG-3\u2032 were used to amplify the coding sequence of the dominant-negative form of X at 48 h posttransfection, cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of 2 or mock infected. incubation was continued until cells were harvested for protein and/or RNA analysis at the indicated time points. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using oligo(dT) and the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) the primers were resolved using a 1% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide. real-time RT-PCR was performed using a 4% agarose gel. the percentage of XBP1 splicing was calculated as the intensity of XBP1s divided by the total intensities of XBP1u and XBP1s. centrifugation at 16,000 g for 1 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were lysed in 1 RIPA buffer. the protein samples were boiled at 90\u00b0C for 5 min and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min. the proteins were detected with a chemiluminescence detection kit. 250 l of diluted supernatants was applied to confluent monolayers of vero cells in 6-well plates. plates were agitated every 10 min to ensure proper coverage of the monolayers. after 2 h of adsorption, unbound viruses were removed. the antibodies against IRE1 (number 3294), PARP (number 9532), caspase 3 (number 9662), caspase 8 (number 9746), caspase 9 (number 9502), JNK (number 9258), phosphorylated JNK (phosphor-JNK) (number 4668), Akt (number 4691), and phosphor-Akt (number 4060) were purchased from cell signaling technology. cDNA of human IRE1 (RefSeq NM_001433.3) was amplified from total RNA of H1299 cells by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) the plasmid was named pcDNA3.1-IRE1-HA. the kinase-dead mutant K599A was generated using site-directed mutagenesis. the cDNA of human XBP1, unspliced isoform (RefSeq NM_005080.3) was amplified from total RNA of H1299 cells treated with 2 mM DTT for 2 h. the PCR products of both XBP1u and XBP1s were digested with BglII and KpnI and inserted into pEGFP-C1. 1299 cells were plated on a 12-well plate the day before transfection. for each well, 0.8 g plasmid DNA and 2 l Lipofectamine 2000 were each diluted with 100 l RPMI and incubated for 5 min. the diluted plasmid and transfection reagent were mixed by brief vortexing. RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using oligo(dT) and the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the PCR products were resolved using a 1% agarose gel. the percentage of XBP1 splicing was calculated as the intensity of XBP1u and XBP1s divided by the total intensities of XBP1u and XBP1s. cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (30) the protein samples were boiled at 90\u00b0C for 5 min and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min. the membranes were incubated with 1 g/ml primary antibodies overnight. diluted anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako) at room temperature for 2 h. the proteins were detected with a chemiluminescence detection kit. the films were scanned as grayscale 8-bit images. the densities of the bands were determined with the NIH software ImageJ. total RNAs were extracted and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR analysis of HERPUD1, a component of the ERAD pathway and a commonly used ER stress marker (33, 34) showed significant increase at the mRNA level in cells infected with IBV and treated with DTT. total RNA was extracted and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis. PCR products were resolved using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. the band intensities of HERPUD1, IRE1, total XBP1, EDEM1, and ERdj4 were determined by densitometry. a moderate degree of XBP1 splicing (15%) was detected in IBV-infected cells at 24 h p.i., compared to 90% splicing in cells treated with DTT. ERdj4, EDEM1, and P58IPK are known to be specifically induced by the spliced form of XBP1 (9) the mRNA level of XBP1s was determined using a pair of primers previously validated to amplify only the spliced variant (35). ERdj4, EDEM1, and P58IPK mRNA levels increased by 2- to 3-fold in IBV-infected cells compared with the mock-infected control. transfection of siXBP1 drastically reduced the mRNA level of total XBP1 and spliced XBP1 induced by DTT by 50%. knockdown of either IRE1 or XBP1 also reduced DTT-induced ERdj4 upregulation by 30 to 40%. this suggested that transfection of the siRNAs specifically reduced the mRNA levels of target genes and downregulated the activation of IRE1-XBP1 pathway triggered by DTT. we infected siRNA-transfected cells with IBV, harvested total RNA at 20 h p.i. and compared the mRNA levels of genes related to the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. transfection with siIRE1 and siXBP1 resulted in 75% and 90% knockdown efficiencies in the endogenous IRE1 and total XBP1 mRNA levels. te ER stress-induced apoptosis (12\u201314) revealed in Fig. 3a. IRE1 and XBP1 cells were transfected with siIRE1, siXBP1 and siEGFP. knockdown of XBP1 reduced the mRNA level of spliced XBP1. the same experiment was performed multiple times. the observed effects of gene knockdown on IBV-induced PARP cleavage were reproducible. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with IBV (MOI, 2). samples collected at 22 h p.i. and the siEGFP-transfected mock-infected protein sample from panel a were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against IBV N, caspase 8, caspase 3, and caspase 9. the siEGFP-transfected mock-infected sample from panel a was subjected to plaque assay analysis using confluent monolayer of vero cells. XBP1u and XBP1s exert opposite effects on IBV-induced apoptosis. overexpression of full-length IRE1 protects cells from IBV-induced apoptosis. IRE1-HA was detected by Western blotting using antibodies against the HA tag. avage at 20 h p.i. (20%) and 24 h p.i. (46%) in cells transfected with IRE1-HA, PARP cleavage was partially reduced to 9% at 20 h p.i. and 24% at 24 h p.i. pcDNA3.1-IRE1-HA, pcDNA3.1-IRE1-K599A-HA, pcDNA3.1-IRE1-IRE1-RNase-HA, or pcDNA3.1 in duplicate. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected or mock infected as for panel a. transfection of wild-type IRE1 but not the kinase-dead or RNase deletion mutant significantly increased the IBV-induced XBP1 splicing and upregulation of ERdj4 compared with the vector control. however, in IBV-infected cells transfected with the IRE1 mutants, PARP cleavage was slightly higher than that of the vector control. XBP1u and XBP1s were fused with EGFP-XBP1u, EGFP-XBP1s or vector plasmid before being infected with IBV or mock infected. transfection of EGFP-XBP1u or EGFP-XBP1s did not significantly affect the replication of IBV, as determined by the similar level of IBV N protein to that of the control. cleavage could be detected at an early time point (20 h p.i.) in cells transfected with EGFP-XBP1s, the level of IBV-induced PARP cleavage was lower than in the control at 24 h p.i. this suggests that XBP1u might function as a weak proapoptotic protein during IBV infection. bar chart shows the results from three independent experiments with standard deviations and P values. all three proteins contain the bZIP DNA binding domain. the proteasome degradation motif in XBP1u was deleted to generate the dominant-negative XBP1-DN. XBP1u is a weak proapoptotic protein, whereas XBPs is an antiapoptotic protein. the kinases JNK and Akt are involved in the antiapoptotic function of IRE1. we investigated the effect of this dominant-negative XBP1 (XBP1-DN) on IBV-induced apoptosis. a time course IBV infection experiment was performed in H1299 cells. cells with IRE1 knocked down had an earlier onset and a significantly higher level of PARP cleavage than negative-control samples at the same time point. in the negative control, relatively weak JNK phosphorylation was detected at 16 and 20 h p.i. the percentage of PARP cleavage was calculated as for Fig. 3a. asterisks indicate significant differences between the indicated samples and the siNC-transfected samples at the same time point. antibodies against IBV N, PARP, phosphor-JNK, and total JNK were included as a loading control. asterisks indicate significant differences between the indicated samples and the siEGFP-transfected samples. IBV infection activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. the PERK branch of the ER stress response is activated in cells infected with IBV at an early stage of infection (31, 32) XBP1 mRNA remained relatively unchanged in cells incubated with UV-IBV. IBV infection causes ER stress and partially activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. total RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. the asterisks indicate significant differences between the indicated samples and the mock-treated sample. ERdj4, EDEM1, and P58IPK are known to be specifically induced by the spliced form of XBP1 (9) dj4 were upregulated in IBV-infected Vero cells. a moderate level of XBP1 splicing was observed at 24 h p.i. real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm results. mRNA levels of IRE1, total XBP1, XBP1s, and ERdj4 significantly increased in the siEGFP-transfected cells compared with a mock-treated control. transfection of siIRE1 significantly reduced the mRNA level of total XBP1 and spliced XBP1 by 70%. knockdown of either IRE1 or XBP1 also reduced ERdj4 upregulation by 30 to 40%. EGFP-transfected samples were transfected with siRNAs for 20 h. total-RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and data analysis were performed as for panel a. asterisks indicate significant differences between the indicated samples and the siEGFP-transfected sample. Knockdown of IRE1 potentiates IBV-induced apoptosis in infected cells. one outcome for cells under ER stress is the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. IRE1 has been previously demonstrated to mediate ER stress. at 22 h p.i., more prominent PARP cleavage was observed in IRE1 knockdown cells than with the siEGFP control. in XBP1 knockdown cells, no significant PARP cleavage could be detected throughout the course of infection. the percentage of PARP cleavage in cells transfected with siIRE1, siXBP1, or siEGFP and infected with IBV for 22 h was determined as for panel a. the results were from three independent experiments with standard deviation and P values. the knockdown of IRE1 or XBP1 did not affect IBV replication. this was determined from the similar N protein levels and the similar virus titers in the supernatant. XBP1 is the main target of IRE1-mediated splicing. the expression of IRE1-HA was detected by Western blotting. in the vector control, IBV induced prominent PARP cleavage at 20 h p.i. (20%) and 24 h p.i. (46%). however, in cells transfected with IRE1-HA, IBV-induced PARP cleavage was partially reduced to 9% at 20 h p.i. and 24% at 24 h p.i. the percentage of PARP cleavage in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-IRE1-HA was determined as for panel a. a lysine-to-alanine mutation at K599 results in loss of IRE1 kinase activity. apoptotic activity, kinase-dead mutant (K599A) and an RNase deletion mutant (RNase) were generated. the expression of transfected plasmids was determined by Western blotting. the protein level of wild-type IRE1 was lower than those of the mutants. XBP1u and XBP1s were transfected with EGFP-XBP1u, EGFP-XBP1s, or vector plasmid before being infected with IBV or mock infected. a similar level of IBV positive-stranded gRNA at 24 h p.i. in all transfected cells seemed to be lower than that of the control. transfection of EGFP-XBP1u, but not EGFP-XBP1u, significantly enhanced the IBV-induced upregulation of ERdj4. compared with the vector control, in cells transfected with EGFP-XBP1u, a low level of PARP cleavage could be detected at an early time point (20 h p.i.), and a slightly higher level of PARP cleavage was also observed at 24 h p. RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR using primers specific for ERdj4, IBV genomic RNA, and GAPDH. percentage of PARP cleavage in plasmid-transfected cells infected with IBV. both XBP1u and XBP1s contain the bZIP DNA binding domain in the N terminus. the presence of a proteasome degradation motif renders it highly unstable in the cells. previous studies have established that when the proteasome degradation motif of XBP1u is deleted, the resulting protein is stabilized and serves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of XBP1s (38) XBP1u is a weak proapoptotic protein, whereas XBPs is an antiapoptotic protein. the kinases JNK and Akt are involved in the antiapoptotic function of IRE1. a time course IBV infection experiment was performed in H1299 cells. Akt protects cells from IBV-induced apoptosis. H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-myr-AKT1. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with IBV or mock infected. the experiment was repeated three times with similar results. asterisks indicate significant differences between the indicated samples and the pcDNA3.1-transfected samples at the same time point (**, P 0.01). Akt is a very strong antiapoptotic protein during IBV infection. the knockdown of JNK was determined from the lower levels of phosphor-JNK and total JNK in the siJNK1/2-transfected cells. in cells transfected with siJNK1/2, IBV-induced PARP cleavage was significantly reduced compared with the negative samples. IBV infection induced ER stress and activated the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of UPR, as indicated by the upregulation of HERPUD1, IRE1, total XBP1, XBP1s, ERdj4 and P58IPK mRNAs in IBV-infected cells. induction of ER stress and the UPR is a general host response during infection with coronaviruses (17, 33) coronavirus may employ various strategies to suppress UPR activation. apoptosis is one possible outcome for cells infected with coronaviruses. apoptosis is one possible outcome for cells infected with coronaviruses. XBP1u was proapoptotic, but the spliced form is antiapoptotic. this was confirmed when a stabilized, dominant-negative form of XBP1 was transfected. a lower level of IBV-induced apoptosis was observed when XBP1 was knocked down using siRNA. knockdown of JNK partially reduced IBV-induced PARP cleavage. it is likely that JNK was activated by other upstream kinases to promote apoptosis. this was modulated by the uncharacterized activity of IRE1. IRE1 mediates splicing of XBP1 and converting it from proapoptotic XBP1u to antiapoptotic XBP1s. IRE1 also modulates the phosphorylation status of the kinases Akt and JNK during IBV infection. the PERK branch of the UPR and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent kinase PKR are activated at the early stage of IBV infection (31) this leads to phosphorylation of eIF2 and upregulation of the growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153), which promotes IBV-induced apoptosis. transducer modulates apoptosis signaling during coronavirus infection. work reveals the antiapoptotic signaling of the UPR in cells infected with IBV."}
