{"summary": "paramyxovirinae has recently been subdivided into seven genera. pneumovirinae is a group of novel paramyxoviruses isolated from wild animals. only JPV has been shown to be pathogenic, causing extensive haemorrhagic lesions in rodents. bat-borne paramyxoviruses are in close relationship to known paramyxoviruses of mammalian. they are known to harbour a broad diversity of PVs, including emergent henipaviruses and rubulaviruses. there have been reports of rabid bats and unusually large numbers of animals succumbing to rabies virus. bat sampling Samples of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, gut, brain and salivary glands were collected. a total of 985 bats (Table 1) were sampled from the caves of Faucon (1\u00b007\u2032N, 13\u00b020\u2032E), Zadi\u00e9 (0\u00b098\u2032N, 13\u00b019\u2032E) and Batouala (0\u00b082\u2032N, 13\u00b045\u2019E) -PCR Batouala cave Coleura afra 26 6 Hipposideros cf. ruber 117 0 Hipposideros gigas 59 0 Miniopterus inflatus 161 0 Rousettus aegyptiacus 18 0 Faucon cave Coleura afra 68 8 Hipposideros cf. ruber 281 0 Hipposideros gigas 121 0 Miniopterus in approximately 100 mg each of the animal's liver and spleen were pooled and crushed in 600 l of cold PBS in a ball-mill tissue grinder. the RNA was then tested for paramyxoviruses using three heminested reverse transcription-PCR assays targeting the polymerase gene [17] and also for marburg virus [18] and Zaire Ebola virus [19]. total RNA was extracted from heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine and brain samples from all 14 real-time RT-PCR-positive bats. total RNA was extracted from heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine and brain samples from all 14 real-time RT-PCR-positive bats. total RNA was extracted using 100 l of the supernatant from each pool. phylogeny was done using MrBayes V.3.2 software and the GTR+G+I nucleotide substitution model [22] for two million generations with a burn-in of 25%. all the capture events, animal handling, euthanasia and transfer of samples across country borders were performed. a total of 985 bats (Table 1) were sampled from the caves of Faucon (1\u00b007\u2032N, 13\u00b020\u2032E), Zadi\u00e9 (0\u00b098\u2032N, 13\u00b019\u2032E) and Batouala (0\u00b082\u2032N, 13\u00b045\u2019E) in July 2009, December 2009 and June 2010. a total of 985 bats (Table 1) were sampled from the caves of Faucon (1\u00b007\u2032N, 13\u00b020\u2032E), Za only one C. afra exhibited severe hemorrhagic lesions in both thoracic and abdominal organs, along with lung congestion and pleurisy. RNA was extracted using a biorobot EZ1 and the EZ1 RNA tissue mini kit (Qiagen) amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 l containing 12.5 l PCR master mix. total RNA was extracted from heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, intestine and brain samples from all 14 real-time RT-PCR-positive bats. total RNA was extracted using 100 l of the supernatant from each pool. RNA was then tested with the specific real-time RT-PCR assay described above. viral sequences obtained were first compared to those available in the public database. phylogenetic analysis indicated that this bat PV was clustered with unclassified paramyxoviruses and was located between the genera Morbillivirus and Henipavirus. phylogenetic analysis indicated that this bat PV was clustered with unclassified paramyxoviruses. fluenza virus 3, NDV = Newcastle disease virus, PigeonPMV = Pigeon paramyxovirus, AMPV6 = Avian paramyxovirus type 6, AMPV2 = Avian paramyxovirus type 2, AMPV3 = Avian paramyxovirus type 3, AMPV4 = Avian paramyxovirus type 4, PIV5 = parainfluenza virus 5, SV41 = Simian virus 41, MenPV = Menangle paramyx BelPV-specific RNA was detected only in the heart (8/12) and liver (5/14) no significant difference in the BelPV RNA detection rate was found between the two organs (2 = 2.476, df = 1, p>0.20) ND ND ND ND ND GB10 271 38 Undet.

BelPV RNA was not searched from blood because in these small species of bats blood was difficult to collect in the field. however, it has been shown that bats of different species occupying the same roosting sites can share the same viruses. the failure to detect BelPV would suggest that this virus has strong host specificity for C. afra. a severe immunodepression may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens. the pathogenicity of the BelPV should be demonstrated by experimental animal infection. the pathogenicity of the BelPV should be demonstrated by experimental animal infection. bats are the natural reservoirs for many viruses, including emerging zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV [27], Hendra and Nipah viruses [26], [35], Ebola virus [36], marburg virus [23], [37], rabies virus and other Lyssaviruses. a serological test is needed to assess zoonotic potential. additional sampling techniques could increase the number of mosquitoes species or groups known to colonize caves. this association between C. afra and BelPV could serve as an interesting model. further studies are needed to confirm this apparent host-virus specificity."}
