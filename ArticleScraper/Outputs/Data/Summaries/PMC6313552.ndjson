{"summary": "health workers (HWs) run an increased risk of contracting infectious diseases. this is well documented for a variety of old infections such as tuberculosis [1,2,3], blood-borne virus infections such as hepatitis C [4], and influenza [5]. however, it also exists for new infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom (SARS) [6,7,8,9], the H1N1-pandemic in 2009 [10,11], and multi from 1996 to 2013 a total of 1121 hepatitis C infections in HWs were recognised as ODs in Germany. a total of EUR 52 million was paid to compensate for the loss of ability to work. a further EUR 36 million was paid for medical treatment of these HWs. an average confirmation rate was calculated by summarising all registered claims and all confirmed cases for the total period. it does not provide an exact confirmation rate but an estimate that should be rather close to the true value. it is compulsory for physicians to report suspected cases of ODs. number of full-time workers insured by the BGW increased from 3,238,000 in 1996 to 4,935,000 in 2017. in 1996, 25.2 claims per 100,000 full-time workers were filed. in 2017, this rate decreased by 39% to 15.4. the average confirmation rate of all claims is 33.0%. notified hepatitis B decreased by about 90%, from 267 cases in 1996 to 38 cases in 2017. the same trend was observed for confirmed claims. year Hepatitis B Claims per 100,000 full-time workers Claims per 100,000 full-time workers Claims per 100,000 full-time workers Claims per 100,000 full-time workers 1996 8.3 2.2 6.1 2.9 1997 8.0 2.1 7.8 3.0 1998 8.7 1.9 6.9 2.9 1999 9.0 2.2 8.9 3.0 2000 7.6 1.5 9.6 3.4 2001 5.4 1.4 10.0 3.0 2002 5.3 1.1 8.0 2.5 2003 3.6 0.8 6.6 2.2 2004 3.1 0.8 a total of 124 influenza-related claims were registered throughout the whole period and 48 were confirmed as OD. there was a spike during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. epidemic keratoconjunctivitis was the cause of 4 to 50 claims per year. the average confirmation rate was 55.9%. the number of claims more than doubled between 1996 and 2017. 1999 124 4.4 47 1.7 - 124 4.4 47 1.7 2000 136 4.6 24 0.8 - 136 4.6 24 0.8 2001 125 4.1 29 1.0 - 125 4.1 29 1.0 2002 125 3.9 33 1.0 - 125 4.1 29 1.0 2002 125 3.9 33 1.0 - 125 3.9 33 1.0 2003 134 3.7 40 1.1 - 134 3.7 40 1.1 2004 191 4.5 50 1.2 - 19 in 2006, the year when MRSA was first recorded separately, 114 cases were registered. in 2017, 39 cases were registered and one case was confirmed as OD. in general, the number of notified cases was lower in the last five years than in previous years. in 2001, a total of 3876 new HBV infections were registered for the general population. this number decreased to 1684 in 2012. in 2004, a total of 9,044 new HCV infections were registered for the general population. 30% to 50% of NSI claims filed nowadays are caused by needles for subcutaneous injections. 141 HIV/AIDS-related claims were registered and 34 claims confirmed. successful post-exposure prophylaxis may be a reason for the low number of claims. from 2006 the number of claims relating to LTBI started to increase. if preventive treatment is performed in these cases, the costs can be covered by the insurance. this is most likely due to the fact that the accident insurance covers long-term effects on workers\u2019 health. most HWs colonised with MRSA will not develop a MRSA-related infection. colonisation is not considered as a disease and can therefore not be recognised as OD. this is why the confirmation rate of MRSA-related claims is low. underreporting is an unlikely explanation for the positive trend in HBV and HCV infections in HWs. about 70% of all ODs in HWs concern hospitals or nursing homes."}
