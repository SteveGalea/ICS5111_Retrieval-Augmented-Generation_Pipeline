{"summary": "the virology research community must come together to exchange ideas and discover new opportunities for collaboration. to launch the CSV, we developed a special workshop in conjunction with the 35th Annual Meeting for the American Society for Virology. the aim was to highlight diversity and excellence of Canadian virology research. myxoma virus can kill a variety of human cancer cells in vitro. ex vivo myxoma virus therapy can delete cancer cells from transplants without harming self-renewing CD34+ stem cells. virologist dr. John S. Colter hired him into his first independent position. he provided important early career mentorship. first trainee presentation was from M.Sc. student Alexa Robitaille. ectopic expression of DUSP1 had no effect on downstream phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun, or levels of cytokines elicited during infection. ectopic expression of DUSP1 may be affecting a different pool of p38 and JNK MAPK enzymes that govern alternative functions. a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach has been proposed to prevent human MERS-CoV infection, by vaccinating camels. this model demonstrated efficient MERS-CoV replication in the upper respiratory tract and shedding of virus [12], but several factors limit the utility of this model for MERS-CoV vaccine development. RNA Virus Evolution RNA replication generates complex \u2018swarms\u2019 of thousands of genetic variants with unknown and unpredictable properties. high mutation rates are a major driver of RNA virus evolution. rapid emergence of adaptive mutations that affect tropism, virulence, fitness and drug resistance. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 prevents efficient recognition of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) the HIV-1 Nef protein contributes to immune evasion by blocking the cell surface localization of major histocompatibility complex I. molecular mechanisms of Nef-mediated alterations in protein trafficking remain incompletely understood. ms. Warkentin presented her findings that a lead molecule, Compound 1.0, blocked infection of native EboV. the related filovirus, Marburgvirus, was resistant to Compound 1.0. bnAbs target the highly-conserved stalk domain of hemagglutinin. both antibodies of IgA isotype and specificity have major consequences on bnAb function. the findings are likely to have profound implications for the successful generation of influenza virus vaccines and therapeutics. AMDV moves from farms to the wild and is exchanged between different farms and countries. a prophylactic vaccine covering all seven major genotypes of HCV remains elusive. an E1E2 vaccine derived from a single gt1a strain (HCV-1) has been shown to elicit bnAbs in guinea pigs, chimpanzees, goats, and healthy human volunteers. SV workshops should keep a focus on trainees, by keeping costs low to maximize opportunities for trainee attendance. some urged collaboration with the well-established Canadian Society for microbiology (CSM) on common goals. following this discussion, CSV2016 adjourned, and the group joined their colleagues from around the world at the ASV2016 reception and opening keynote lecture.
