{"summary": "1595 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS have been reported with a fatality rate of more than 30%. there is growing evidence that dromedary camel is a reservoir for the virus and a source of human infection. a total of 186 cases have been reported in the republic of Korea. gia, pleuritic chest pain and fever since 10 days prior to admission. he developed dyspnea, fever, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain and cough. four days later, he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. blood cultures, urine culture and sputum smear and culture were negative for bacterial infections. but molecular tests became positive for MERS-CoV using upstream of E gene region real-time RT-PCR assay (upE assay) (8) with a threshold cycle of 31.34. chest X ray revealed significant improvement at the 4th day of admission. complete blood count changed to normal (WBC 7100 cells/mm3, lymphocytes: 35%, neutrophils: 60%, monocytes: 5%, and platelets: 297,000 cell/mm3) and liver enzymes significantly decreased. the patient was discharged without any sequel after four days. genetic sequencing data revealed a close link association between the virus found in camels and that found in human. most MERS-CoV cases have been reported in adults (median age approximately 50 years, and male predominance), while children and the elderly have also been infected (range 9 months to 94 years) human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV can occur in health care providers and may be associated with substantial morbidity and occasionally mortality (10). a significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 49% for the nosocomial outbreak in jeddah and Saudi Arabia in 2014 (17) to 100 % for both the outbreak in al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia in 2013 (10) and the recent outbreak in south Korea in 2015 (16). 6 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported from Iran. 5 cases in Kerman province during May\u2013July 2014. 1 case in Kahnooj city in March 2015 (22) CONCLUSION MERS outbreaks are significantly augmented in the healthcare facilities. infection in the healthcare setting is an important risk factor for person to-person transmission."}
