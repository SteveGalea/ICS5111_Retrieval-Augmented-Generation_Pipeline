{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses replicate at membranous structures that accommodate the viral replication complex and facilitate RNA synthesis in the cytosol of infected host cells. the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) is generated by translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-proteolytically processed by viral proteases. the remaining nsps are thought to comprise the coronaviral RTC. they harbor multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, exo- and endonuclease. many of these functions have been studied using reverse genetic approaches. based screens have been applied to other positive-stranded RNA viruses. some of these proteins were described in the context of distinct ER processes. they may interact with viral replication complexes, but likely constitute only a small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment. results Engineering the BirAR118G biotin ligase into the MHV replicase transcriptase complex. we used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system to generate a recombinant MHV harboring an in-frame fusion of myc-tagged BirAR118G to nsp2. a deleted cleavage site between nsp1 and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-n recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 was compared to wild-type MHV-A59 and recombinant MHV-GFP-nsp2. the positive-sense RNA genome of MHV contains a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 poly(A) tail. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral replication and transcription complex (nsp1-16) L929 cells were infected with MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 (MOI = 1) in medium supplemented with 67 M biotin. cells were fixed 15 hr post infection (h.p.i.) and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. the black arrow indicates the fusion protein corresponding to the predicted molecular weight (102.2 kDa) high molecular weight proteins probably representing viral polyprotein precursors were also specifically detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 \u2013derived samples. immunofluorescence analysis of MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-mediated biotinylation. western blot analysis confirmed that the BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein is specifically detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells. the biotin ligase remains fused to nsp2 during MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infection. recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 replicates with comparable kinetics to wild-type MHV-A59, expresses a functional BirAR118G biotin ligase that is tightly associated with the MHV RTC. biotinylated, RTC-proximal proteins can be readily detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infected cells. efficiency and specificity of BirAR118G-mediated biotinylation. we assessed fractions of biotinylated proteins derived from MHV-A59-, MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells. a characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed. L929 cells were infected with MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 or MHV-A59. cells were lysed 15 h.p.i. and biotinylated factors were subjected to affinity purification using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. nsp1, nsp11, structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane proteins (M) were either not significantly enriched or not detected. nsp1, nsp11, structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane proteins (M) were either not significantly enriched or not detected. 1381 host proteins were identified, of which 513 were statistically significantly enriched in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected samples over MHV-A59-infected samples. these host proteins represent a comprehensive repertoire of RTC-proximal factors throughout MHV infection (Figure 2c, Supplementary file 1). nsp1 is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function in coronavirus replication. nsp11 is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function. nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC. we assessed the localization of a limited number of host proteins from our candidate list in MHV-infected cells. this included the ER protein reticulon 4 (RTN4; Figure 2e) and host proteins where co-localization was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; Figure 2e). 86 GO biological process (BP) terms were significantly enriched in the dataset (p-value 0.05) of which 32 terms were highly significant (p-value 0.005). additional analysis using AmiGO revealed that 25 of these 32 highly significant GO BP terms fell into five broad functional categories. despite 'cell-cell adhesion' scoring high, it represents a typical limitation of gene annotation databases. most genes assigned to the GO BP term 'cell-cell adhesion' are also found in the other categories described below. cluster I comprised nuclear transport receptors at nuclear pore complexes, such as importins and transportins. rin-coated vesicle transport between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network is closely associated with the actin cytoskeleton. cluster IV components can be regarded as regulating late-Golgi trafficking events and interacting with the endosomal system. a number of MHV RTC-proximal factors were assigned to category \u2018translation\u2019. regulatory elements, such as Igf2bp1, Gcn1l1, Larp, Fam129a and Nck1, are further indicative of the host cell translation machinery near sites of viral RNA synthesis. the category \u2018catabolic processes\u2019 includes a subset of autophagy-related factors and numerous ubiquitin-dependent ERAD components. siRNA-mediated silencing of 53 RTC-proximal host factors significantly reduced MHV replication compared to non-targeting siRNA controls. bf1, arf1, and verheije et al., 2008, found that siRNA-mediated silencing of these factors significantly reduced MHV replication compared to non-targeting siRNA controls. Upon 48 hr siRNA silencing, L929 fibroblasts were pulsed with 3 M puromycin for 60 min. Western blot quantification of total cellular translation following silencing of a subset of the host translation apparatus. expression levels of Rpl13a, eIF3E, eIF3I, eIF3F, eIF4G1, eIF4G2, eIF2ak3, Rsl24d1 following siRNA knockdown compared to expression levels in cells treated with non-targetting siRNA. RNA silencing (b) and translation activity (c) in Rpl13a-silenced cells could not be assessed. siRNA-mediated silencing of Kif11, Snx9, Dnm11, Scfd1, Ykt6, Stx5a, Clint1, Aak11, or Vapa. ER-associated protein sorting complexes associated with ribosome and newly synthetized proteins also appear to be required for efficient MHV replication. close proximity of the host cell translation machinery to the viral RTC likely has functional importance for coronavirus replication. MHV replication is dependent on a subset of RTC-proximal translation initiation factors. for eIFs 3i, 3 f, and 3e viral replication was reduced. eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i proteins were knockdown significantly restricted. eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i protein levels were significantly restricted. siRNA silencing and western blot assessment of eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i protein levels. in non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern. active translation in vicinity of the viral RTC was strongest during the early phase of infection at 6 h.p.i. we observed a similar phenotype in human coronaviruses. the HCoV-229E RTC appeared as small and dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection. the co-localization gradually decreased as the infection reached the late phase with upcoming signs of CPE. cells were pulsed with cycloheximide, emetine and puromycin for 5 min to label translating ribosomes. non-infected and/or non-pulsed cells were used as control. cells were labelled using anti-nsp8 (HCoV-229E) or dsRNA (MERS-CoV) and anti-puromycin antibodies. MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and nsp2. a deleted cleavage site between nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein. this strategy was chosen because it was recently employed by Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2. the positive-sense RNA genome of MHV contains a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 poly(A) tail. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral replication and transcription complex (nsp1-16) myc-BirAR118G was inserted as an N-terminal fusion with nsp2 within ORF1a. a deleted cleavage site between nsp2 and nsp2 ensured the release of a cells were fixed 15 hr post infection (h.p.i.) and processed for immunofluorescence analysis with antibodies directed against the BirAR118G (anti-myc), the viral replicase (anti-nsp2/3) and biotinylated factors (streptavidin). MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2, MHV-A59- or non-infected L929 fibroblasts were cultured in medium supplemented with 67 M biotin. cells were fixed 9 and 15 hr post infection (h.p.i.) and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. western blot analysis confirmed that the BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein is specifically detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells. the biotin ligase remains fused to nsp2 during MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infection. recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 replicates with comparable kinetics to wild-type MHV-A59, expresses a functional BirAR118G biotin ligase. biotinylated, RTC-proximal proteins can be readily detected in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 infected cells. a characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed under all conditions where no exogenous biotin was added to the culture medium. the same pattern was detectable in non-infected and wild-type MHV-A59-infected cells when the culture medium was supplemented with biotin. cells were lysed 15 h.p.i. and biotinylated factors were subjected to affinity purification using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. total cell lysates and affinity-purified fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. L929 cells were seeded on coverslips, infected with MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 (e) or MHV-A59 (f), fixed at 9 h.p.i. and processed for immunofluorescence using anti-myc, anti-RTN4 and anti-eIF3E antibodies (e) or anti-dsRNA, anti-RTN4 and anti-eIF3E antibodies (f) rAR118G-nsp2-infected samples over MHV-A59-infected samples. these host proteins represent a comprehensive repertoire of RTC-proximal factors throughout MHV infection. these factors were not considered for further investigation in context of our RTC-proximal biotinylation proteomic screen. nsp1 is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function in coronavirus replication. nsp11 is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function. nsp11 is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of poly proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (RTN4; Figure 2e), and host proteins where co-localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable. a more sensitive detection technique, such as proximity ligation assay that relies on proximity-dependent antibody-coupled DNA probe amplification, demonstrated proximity of eIF3E and dsRNA 25 of these 32 highly significant GO BP terms fell into five broad functional categories, namely cell adhesion, transport, cell organization, translation, and catabolic processes. to examine these categories further, identify important cellular pathways within them, and extract known functional associations among RTC-proximal host proteins. the category 'transport' included protein trafficking and vesicular-mediated transport pathways and comprised the majority of RTC-proximal factors. cluster I, protein transport, comprised nuclear transport receptors at nuclear pore complexes, such as importins and transportins. cluster also contained Sec63, which is part of the Sec61 translocon. a number of MHV RTC-proximal factors were part of the host translation machinery and assigned to category \u2018translation\u2019. the high degree of interaction between these subunits is suggestive of the presence of the entire translation initiation apparatus in close proximity to the viral RTC. coronavirus RTC-proximal proteins identified by proximity labeling greatly expand the repertoire of candidate proteins implicated in the coronavirus replication cycle. we designed a custom siRNA library targeting the expression of each of the 513 identified RTC-proximal host proteins. we found that siRNA-mediated silencing of 53 RTC-proximal host factors significantly reduced MHV replication compared to non-targeting siRNA controls. this work was performed in a murine fibroblast cell line, but the identification of antiviral proteins may be anticipated in a similar siRNA-mediated knockdown screen. L929 fibroblasts were infected with MHV-Gluc (MOI = 0.05, n = 3) Upon 48 hr siRNA-silencing, L929 fibroblasts were pulsed with 3 M puromycin for 60 min. Western blots were probed using anti-puromycin antibodies to assess puromycin incorporation into polypeptides and normalized to actin levels. eIF3F, eIF4G1, eIF4G2, eIF2ak3, Rsl24d1 following siRNA knockdown compared to expression levels in cells treated with non-targetting siRNA (scramble). RNA silencing (b) and translation activity (c) could not be assessed due to cytotoxicity observed by visual inspection of cells. ER-associated protein sorting complexes associated with ribosome and newly synthetized proteins appear to be required for efficient MHV replication. MHV replication was significantly reduced upon silencing of core elements of the 26S and 20S proteasome complex (Psmd1 and Psmc2 and Psmb3). on a subset of RTC-proximal translation initiation factors, we extended these results in independent assays. for this, we selected all host factors assigned to the category \u2018translation\u2019 and assessed virus replication following siRNA-mediated silencing of each factor. Specifically for eIFs 3i, 3 f, and 3e viral replication was reduced to levels comparable to our controls Ceacam1a (MHV receptor) and Gbf1. 10 nM individual target-specific siRNA were transfected in L929 for 48 hr. western blots were probed using antibodies directed against eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i. gene quantification of eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i upon siRNA knockdown. in non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern interspersed with punctate structures indicative of translation localized to dedicated subcellular cytosolic locations. active translation in vicinity of the viral RTC was strongest during the early phase of infection. a similar phenotype was observed in Huh7 cells infected with human coronaviruses. the HCoV-229E RTC appeared as small and dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection. the co-localization gradually decreased as the infection reached the late phase with upcoming signs of CPE. non-infected and/or non-pulsed cells were used as control. cells were labelled using anti-nsp8 (HCoV-229E) or dsRNA (MERS-CoV) and anti-puromycin antibodies. nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. nsp2 fusion proteins encoded by recombinant MHV-APEX2-nsp2 and MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 are indeed part of the RTC and localize to characteristic coronavirus replicative structures. in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells the detection of biotinylated coronavirus replicase gene products nsp2-10, ns ase/helicase (nsp13), the 5\u2019-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16), the proof-reading exonuclease (nsp14), suggests close proximity of nsp2 to the site of viral RNA synthesis. nsp2-16 and the nucleocapsid protein collectively constitute a functional coronavirus replication and transcription complex in infected cells. numerous coronavirus RTC-proximal host proteins and pathways have documented roles in the life cycle of other, more intensively studied, positive-stranded RNA viruses. recent genome-wide CRISPR screens identified proteins involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, as required for flavivirus replication. coronavirus RTC is translated as two polyproteins that contain nsp3, 4 and 6 with multiple trans-membrane domains that are believed to anchor the RTC at ER-derived membranes. this idea is also applicable to many positive-stranded RNA viruses that express viral polyproteins with embedded trans-membrane domains to anchor the viral replication complex in host endomembranes. coronaviruses have evolved a similar strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated translation. a close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to ensure translation of viral mRNA. coronaviruses may have evolved a two-pronged strategy to ensure efficient translation of viral proteins by establishing viral RNA synthesis in close proximity to actively translating ribosomes. the strategy to assemble the viral RTC in close proximity to translation would also favor the coupling between genome translation and replication. AR118G to label viral and host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with the viral RTC. association of host cell proteins with the viral RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle.
