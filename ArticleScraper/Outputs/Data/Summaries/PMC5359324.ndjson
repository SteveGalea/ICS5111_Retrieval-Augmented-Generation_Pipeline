{"summary": "Yong-Tang Zheng (KIZ, CAS) delivered keynote lecture on the establishment of the National Research Facility for Phenotypic and Genotypic Analysis of Model Animals (Primates) the blueprint of the NRFPGAMA was presented, which highlighted its involvement in sophisticated crosstalk from NHP breeding, NHP resource management, mega data collection and analysis. also discussed were the future directions of this major, multifaceted scientific facility. a rhesus macaque model of co-infection with malaria and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) showed that Plasmodium infection reduced the replication-competent virus pool in resting CD4+ T cells. this may be attributable to the activation and apoptosis of memory CD4+ T cells induced by malaria. team inoculated PTMs with HIV-1 strains and monitored the infections for three years. results suggest that HIV-1-infected NPMs might function as a potential NHP animal model in HIV-1 latency studies and in developing novel therapeutic strategies. myelination of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is necessary for medial PFC (mPFC)-dependent behaviors. blockade of oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation or lysolecithin-induced demyelination can impair mPFC functions. the anteroposterior patterning of the central nervous system follows an activation/transformation model. the anterior fate will be activated by default during the neural induction stage, with the anterior fate transformed posteriorly per caudalization morphogens. the DV patterning model remains elusive. a total of 18 anatomically diverse lncRNA modules and 14 mRNA modules representing spatial, age, and sex specificities were identified. the findings provide insight into spatial-, age- and sex-related dynamics of lncRNA expression during postnatal development and aging. lncRNA expression might represent a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism in shaping brain architecture and function. Drs. Jian-Hong Wang and Gong Chen presented recent work on the in vivo reprogramming of reactive glial cells directly into the functional neurons by single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 in the monkey brain. tree shrews have a close relationship to primates and have many advantages over rodents in biomedical research. a lack of gene manipulation methods has hindered their wider usage. cynomolgus monkey ESCs grown in adjusted culture conditions could be incorporated into host embryos and develop into chimeras. cynomolgus monkey ESCs grown in adjusted culture conditions could be incorporated into host embryos and develop into chimeras with contribution in all three germ layers and in germ cell progenitors. chimeric monkeys are able to generate naive-like cells using ESCs. a small \"hole\" is created in the inferior colliculus of rhesus monkeys. stem cells were then transplanted in situ to investigate their integration into the auditory neural network. the 4th NHP symposium will continue to flourish both domestically and internationally. the organizers sincerely hope that the next symposium will continue to flourish both domestically and internationally. a rhesus macaque model of co-infection with malaria and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) showed that Plasmodium infection reduced the replication-competent virus pool in resting CD4+ T cells (a major viral reservoir), which might be attributable to the activation and apoptosis of memory CD4+ T cells. CHIKV is an important mosquito-borne human pathogen, which can cause abrupt high fever, headache, rashes, myalgia, and arthralgia.
