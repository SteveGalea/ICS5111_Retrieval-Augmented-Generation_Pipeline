{"summary": "MERS-CoV effectively infected cells bearing human, horse, or camel receptors. a virus-activating protease increased susceptibility to infection, particularly for low-efficiency receptors. RNA Polymerase III Transcribes high levels of bovine foamy virus microRNAs Foamy viruses are ubiquitous, nonpathogenic retroviruses capable of establishing persistent infections in a variety of animal hosts. the PDZD8 coiled-coil domain is sufficient for capsid binding. other domains of the protein are required for capsid stabilization. interfering with the interaction of PDZD8 and retroviral capsids could prove to be a useful pharmaceutical approach. infections."}
