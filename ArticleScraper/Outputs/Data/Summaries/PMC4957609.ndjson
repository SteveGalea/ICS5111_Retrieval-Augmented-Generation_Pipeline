{"summary": "the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapore in the event of an imported case of MERS would be mitigated by its strong health-care system and established infection control practices. the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapore would be mitigated by its strong health-care system and established infection control practices. the last case of MERS-CoV associated with the outbreak was reported on 5 July 2015, leading to a total of 186 cases including 36 deaths reported in the Republic of Korea. the risk assessment included literature review, epidemiology and risk analysis of infectious diseases, risk communication, and emergency preparedness and response. flight itineraries capture an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s air traffic. each itinerary includes information on the travellers\u2019 point of origin, final destination, and where applicable, connecting flights. results Hazard assessment MERS is a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in 2012. the largest MERS outbreak outside the saudi arabia occurred in 2015. the index case travelled to the middle east and developed symptoms one week after returning to the Republic of Korea. by the time the diagnosis was established, the case transmitted the infection to his wife, other patients and visitors in the same room/ward. the country ranked 11th with an average of 42 283 travellers coming from the Republic of Korea per month. the importation of the MERS-CoV infection from the Republic of Korea to Singapore is possible. more than 16 000 contacts were monitored during the entire outbreak. the increase corresponded with the decrease in the number of new cases reported. a national safe hospital program was implemented to control MERS-CoV transmission within hospitals. temperature screening at air checkpoints has been in place since 18 May 2014. temperature screening at air checkpoints for passengers arriving from affected countries commenced on 9 June 2015. health advisories distributed at border checkpoints for travellers coming from and going to areas affected by MERS-CoV. a designated quarantine housing will be on standby and can be deployed at short notice to safeguard public health. a coordinated national response plan against disease threats, including MERS-CoV, has been developed. the disease outbreak response system condition provides a quick reference to agencies and the public on the current disease situation. a travel ban was imposed on quarantined persons from travelling within and out of the Republic of Korea. potential public health impact to Singapore Infection results in severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multiorgan failure leading to death. high hospitalization and case fatality rates. the source of MERS-CoV and the mode of transmission have yet to be determined. the pattern of disease reported in humans appears to be the result of repeated introductions of the virus. 83% appeared to be linked to five clustering events, resulting in four generations of cases. there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community or airborne transmission. pattern of transmission in the Republic of Korea was similar to that of the outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. the majority of the MERS cases in the Republic of Korea had been infected before adequate infection prevention and control procedures were applied. in response to the surge in cases, the Republic of Korea authorities subsequently implemented intense case and contact management measures. a national safe hospital program was implemented to control MERS-CoV transmission within hospitals by providing care for patients with respiratory diseases in secured areas separate from outpatient or emergency department. repeated testing was required on 27 of 186 cases (15%). temperature screening may not pick up all imported cases due to the long incubation period of MERS-CoV and the presence of mild and asymptomatic cases. all hospitals and doctors have been reminded to remain vigilant and to step up their operational readiness in the event of an imported case. patients with clinical signs/symptoms of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and a travel history to the region in the two weeks before onset will be evaluated. the majority of the MERS cases in the Republic of Korea had been infected before adequate infection prevention and control procedures were applied. in response to the surge in cases, the Republic of Korea authorities subsequently implemented intense case and contact management measures. a national safe hospital program was implemented to control MERS-CoV transmission within hospitals by providing care for patients with respiratory diseases in secured areas separate from outpatient or emergency department. the Republic of Korea used the real-time reverse transcription PCR protocol recommended by WHO (17) repeated testing was required on 27 of 186 cases (15%). patients with clinical signs/symptoms of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and a travel history will be evaluated to exclude MERS-CoV infection. people with a fever and respiratory illness of any severity who had recently visited a health-care facility while travelling in the region will also be similarly evaluated. the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea was the largest outside Saudi Arabia. no evidence of sustained community transmission or airborne transmission. the outbreak was largely contained in the Republic of Korea. the risk characterization suggests that the likelihood of MERS-CoV importation into Singapore is possible in view of air traffic between Singapore and the Republic of Korea. the risk of serious public health impact to Singapore in the event of an imported case of MERS-CoV infection would be mitigated by a strong health-care system. the risk assessment is based on limited data as only one case had been exported from the Republic of Korea and no cases had been imported into Singapore. a better understanding of the variation in individual infectiousness and the environmental impact could provide key information on epidemic spread and facilitate the design of control measures."}
