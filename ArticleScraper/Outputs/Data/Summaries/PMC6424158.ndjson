{"summary": "an exploratory, iterative approach was used to identify relevant scientific literature using Google Scholar. the lead author conducted multiple searches for articles published between 2008 and 2018 using the following keywords: \u201chost genetic\u201d OR \u201chuman genetic\u201d. human genetics of high-consequence infectious diseases is at an early stage. no human genetic studies have been published for pathogens of recent emergence, such as MERS-CoV. the rate of discovery may accelerate with emphasis on improving translation from bench to bedside, precision medicine, and the medical countermeasures pipeline. a systems biology approach to host-pathogen interactions has taken off, using next-generation sequencing, gene expression profiling with proteomics and metabolomics, and global RNAi screens to identify host factors. over 40% of the articles (34/82) listed no applications. the most commonly cited application of host genetic research was the identification of targets to guide the development of new therapeutics for high-consequence infectious diseases. a study framed differences in smallpox vaccine response as 'genetic disparity' no studies suggested genetic screening for vaccine response as a potential application of the research, instead focusing on recommendations for rationalizing vaccine design. genetic screening was mentioned in studies of avian influenza and SARS. the avian influenza studies spoke generally of using genetic susceptibility information to help identify high-risk individuals or target them for prevention efforts. avian influenza was the most widely studied infection. but a rigorous systematic review identified only 1 study providing good evidence for an important role for IFITM3 in susceptibility to severe influenza in mice. the rate of discovery may accelerate with emphasis on, and investments in, improving translation from bench to bedside, precision medicine, and the medical countermeasures pipeline. CC mouse models have been developed for 3 high-consequence pathogens. genetics may play a role in shaping a number of high-consequence infectious disease outcomes, influencing susceptibility (or resistance) to infection, disease progression and severity, immune responses, or response to preventive or therapeutic interventions. large numbers of military personnel have been given smallpox and anthrax vaccines. the second most commonly cited application of host genetic research was improving vaccine development (23%, 19/82) the final 2 applications of host genetic information for high-consequence infectious diseases were cited infrequently in the sample. guiding decisions about repurposing existing drugs were cited in the sample. one study developed a computational platform using Ebola proteomics data to identify and rank FDA-approved drugs. the most likely direct use of genetics may be biomarkers to predict disease progression and outcome. if confirmed, genetic information about infectious disease may have practical and ethical relevance for various stakeholders. high-level isolation units could make use of information about genetic susceptibility, resistance, and vaccine response to inform which providers are involved in direct patient care. high-level isolation units may want to discuss how best to evaluate risks and benefits of using host-directed therapies as they enter the medical countermeasures pipeline. a broader review of host factors in high-consequence infectious diseases would undoubtedly surface other kinds of bioassays relevant for understanding and predicting disease progression and outcome. drug repurposing is often lauded as a potentially faster and cheaper avenue for new treatments. but pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to invest in trials to test new uses for off-patent drugs. the repurposing potential of existing drugs remains unproven. there is precedent in the high-consequence pathogen space. a voluntary benefit-sharing framework has been established for pandemic influenza. no such global benefit-sharing framework for Ebola or other high-consequence pathogens has been developed. high-level isolation units will need to consider the broader ethics of using biomarkers that predict disease course and outcomes. host genetic markers are only one of many potential biomarkers that may be discovered."}
