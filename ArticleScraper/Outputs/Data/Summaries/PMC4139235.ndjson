{"summary": "antigenic properties are used to classify HA into 17 subtypes with H1, H5 and H7 being of special concern. the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza outbreak caused more than 50 million deaths worldwide. seasonal influenza is responsible for more than 250,000 deaths per year worldwide (2, 3) fusion inhibitors have been shown to bind to the highly conserved stem loop region of HA. a number of fusion inhibitors have been shown to bind to the highly conserved stem loop region of HA. this is the region that undergoes a critical coil to helix transition. plasmids pH5HA (bearing wild-type or mutant HA), p-nitroanilide (bearing N1 influenza nueraminidase), and pNL4\u20133.Luc.R-E- using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) were maintained in HEK 293T cells. for Western blot analyses, virions were normalized to p24 levels (22) and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to inin ELISA Development Kit (Immune Technology Corp.) mixed with at different dilutions into a 40-l suspension of 0.5% chicken red blood cells in a 96-well plate. after 2 h, the virions were aspirated and replaced with medium. the IC50 from the equation: entry = entrymax/(1 + ([inhibitor]/IC50) n), where entrymax = entry in the absence of inhibitor and n = Hill coefficient was considered for the modeling studies. the SITE-ID module of the Tripos molecular modeling package (23) was used to identify the potential small molecule ligand binding sites. virions were normalized to p24 levels (22) and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to a 1% final amount, and subsequent incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. virions were normalized to p24 levels (22) and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to a 1% final amount. hemagglutination assay performed as previously described (21) with normalization to total HA. 60 l of virus or control stocks were mixed with at different dilutions. after 2 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C the results were recorded. the inhibition of entry was performed by diluting stock solutions of C179 (1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4) or MBX2329 (20 mm in 100% DMSO) the inhibition of entry was performed by diluting stock solutions of C179 (1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate,. 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4) and, in the case of MBX2329, determining the IC50 the complex was carried out at 300 K with a time step of 1.5 fs and equilibrium time of 1 ps. the plot of the potential energy versus the time at 10 ns revealed that the system had attained an equilibrium condition. virions were normalized to p24 levels and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to a 1% final amount. the relative amount of HA on the Western blots was determined by a densitometric analysis as previously described (22). Briefly, digital scans of the blots were opened in Photoshop 7.0, the image was inverted, the appropriate bands were selected with the Lasso function, and the mean intensity and area were measured with the Histogram function. accordingly as, where I and A denote the mean intensity and band area, respectively. the viral entry levels fell within the linear range of detection (i.e. the values of the wild-type and mutants never exceeded 3 106 relative light units) the inhibition of entry was performed by diluting stock solutions of C179 (1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4) virions were normalized to p24 levels (22) and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to a 1% final amount. virions were normalized to p24 levels (22) and were normalized to p24 levels (22). the blots were probed with mouse anti-H5-HA1 monoclonal antibody. the secondary antibody used was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. digital scans of the blots were opened in Photoshop 7.0. 500 l of the virus stock was added to each of the wells of the A549 cells. after 6 h, the virions were aspirated and replaced with medium. the cells were allowed to rest for another 48 h. molecular dynamics simulations (MDS)2 in the OPLS2005 force field was used to carry out the MDS of the H5 and MBX2329 complex structures. all MDS computations were carried out in one NPT ensemble (constant pressure and temperature) p57, and Met102 of HA2 are less conserved and designed to assay differences between Group 1 (i.e. H1 and H5) and Group 2 (i.e. H3 and H7) HA. for clarity, only one monomer of the symmetric trimer is shown. mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-I28V, HA1-M102L, HA2-V52A, and HA2-I55A exhibit >50% HA processing. mutants HA1-D26K, HA1-M102L, HA2-V52A, and HA2-I55A exhibit significantly reduced levels of total HA (30% of the wild-type HA levels), suggesting that the mutation has not significantly affected HA expression, processing mutants HA1-D26K, HA2-T49A, and HA2-M102L are competent to bind to their receptor and have not disrupted the HA1 structure. the primary antibody used is against HA1 and thus detects both HA0 and HA1. virions containing wild-type or single site mutations exhibit decreased entry with respect to the wild-type, even those with relatively conservative substitutions (e.g. HA2-T49A or HA2-D57E). virions containing single-site mutations exhibit decreased entry with respect to the wild-type, even those with relatively conservative substitutions. mutants that exhibit impaired (but measurable) entry include: HA1-I28A, HA1-I28V, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q42A, HA2-I45A, HA2-T49A, HA2-N53A, HA2-S54R, HA2-I55V, and HA2-D57E. mutants that exhibit the least effects on entry include: HA1-M31L, HA2-V52A, 42A, HA2-T49A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, HA2-S54R, HA2-D57E, HA2-M102A, and HA2-M102L exhibit entry inhibition. mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31A, HA1-M31L, HA2-I45A, and HA2-I55V render HA less sensitive to entry inhibition by C179.

HA2-L99A is more sensitive to entry inhibition by C179 (>300% more sensitive, Table 2). mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31A, HA1-M31L, HA2-I45A, and HA2-I55V render HA less sensitive to entry inhibition by C179. the mutation decreases antibody binding and/or mode of action. each experiment was performed in triplicate. mutants HA1-I28V, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q42A, HA2-T49A, HA2-I55V, HA2-D57E, and HA2-M102L have

become insensitive to MBX2329 and thus the mutation appears to have disrupted the binding and/or mode of action of the compound. this latter set of mutations may give insights into potential escape mechanisms for this compound. mutant sites are comprised of HA2 residues 40\u2013110 (H3 numbering) residues 22\u201335 of HA1 and 17\u201325 of HA2 also make contacts in this region. positions Thr41,

entry of virions containing wild-type or single site mutations into A549 lung cells. all single-site mutations exhibit decreased entry with respect to the wild-type, even those with relatively conservative substitutions (e.g. HA2-T49A or HA2-D57E). for ease of discussion we have divided the effects into 3 classes: non-functional (1% entry), impaired (1\u201325%), and intermediate (>25%)

presence of varying amounts of MBX2329 and the IC50 and error values were determined. a next step, we analyzed the binding pose of MBX2329 with the HA stem loop region obtained from the 10-ns MDS. the MBX2329 ligand binding site is found to be in the similar location to that of the TBHQ site within the stem loop (18). positions asp26, Ile28, and Met31 of HA1 and Thr49, Val52, Ser54, Ile55, Asp57,

have little effect on the IC50 of the compound. mutants HA1-I28A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, HA2-S54R, and HA2-L99A become insensitive to MBX2329 and the MBX2329 ligand binding site is found to be in the similar location to that of the TBHQ site within the stem loop (18). the binding pose of compound and its interaction with the different residues of HA stem is shown in Fig. 6. Molecular dynamics model of the MBX2329 interaction with H5 HA. mutations at residues HA2-Ile45, HA2-Val52, and HA2-Asn53 greatly reduced the potency of the compound. the modeled site is proximal but shifted toward the viral membrane with respect to the TBHQ site determined by x-ray crystallography. a number of mutations have previously been characterized for HA at identical sites. in Fig. 7 we show space filling diagrams of the effects on entry. outer face (i.e. solvent exposed) and inner face (i.e. contact region with other subunits) of a single HA monomer. the outer face represents the solvent-exposed region and the inner face. substitutions to HA2-Ile45 of the outer face and HA1-Met31 and HA2-Ile45 of the inner face decreased potency to 0.5 with respect to the wild-type. in contrast, substitution of HA2-Leu99 enhanced potency of the antibody to >3 with respect to the wild-type (green color) mutational effects depicted for the outer face residues directly affect the binding of MBX2329 to the neutral pH conformation. however, more subtle mutational effects to the low pH conformations are possible. residues HA1-Met31, HA2-Ile45, and HA2-Leu99 exhibited large effects in all three assays."}
