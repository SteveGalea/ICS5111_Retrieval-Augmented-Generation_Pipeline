{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two notable examples of novel coronaviruses that emerged during the last decade (1, 2, 4) infection with these coronaviruses can result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. rMA15-E induced strong T cell responses in susceptible 6-week-old and 12-month-old BALB/c mice. rMA15-E induced strong T cell responses (11, 13, 14) Cytotoxic T cells play a crucial role in clearing respiratory viruses. antigen-specific memory CD8 T cells are categorized into three subpopulations. a population of tissue resident memory CD8 T cells exists in the peripheral tissues after a pathogen encounter. the number and efficacy of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung airways correlate with the ability to clear a secondary virus challenge. mice were primed intravenously with DCs loaded with peptide (S436 or S525) and then boosted intranasally with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) encoding S436 or S525. the oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into PSC65. DCs were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old B6 mice previously inoculated subcutaneously with 1 106 B16 cells expressing Flt3L. 106 lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-matured DCs were coated with 1 M peptide (S436 or S525) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. all infected mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. mice that lost 30% of their initial body weight were euthanized. all challenge experiments were carried out in the animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. anti-IFN- (XMG1.2), allophycocyanin-anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (APC-anti-TNF-) (MP6-XT22), APC-anti-interleukin 2 (APC-anti-IL-2) (JES6-5H4), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-anti-CD107a/b, and PE-anti-CD69 (H1.2F3) were procured from splenocytes from naive CD45.1 (Ly5.2) mice were labeled with either 1 M or 100 nM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes); labeled cells were then pulsed with peptides (5 M) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. total lung cells were isolated at 12 h after transfer. results in the graphs below are represented as means standard errors of the means (SEM) unless otherwise mentioned. results in the graphs below are represented as means standard errors of the means. 106 B16 cells expressing Flt3L were harvested and pulsed. peptide-pulsed DCs were then injected into 8- to 9-month-old mice. mice were boosted by intranasal inoculation of rVV encoding. all challenge experiments were carried out in the animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. mice were euthanized on different days postchallenge and lungs were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) titers are represented as PFU/g of lung tissue. PE-Cy7-anti-CD8 (53-6.7), rat anti-mouse IFN- (XMG1.2), hamster PE-anti-CD103 (2E7), V510-rat anti-mouse CXCR3 (CXCR3-173), and V450-anti-CD11a (M17/4) were procured from eBioscience. or MA15-challenged mice were first incubated on ice with Fc block (anti-CD16/32 antibody) for 15 min, followed by incubation with the APC-conjugated tetramer at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. cells were then surface stained with PE-Cy7 anti-CD8 antibody. in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 5 after infection. RESULTS Prime-boost immunization induces a strong CD8 T cell response. we used a prime-boost strategy to generate large numbers of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in the BAL and lungs. or rVV-S525 generated a large pool of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the BAL, lungs, and spleen. the proportion and number of S525-specific CD8 T cells were significantly higher in BAL, lungs, and spleen than those of S436-specific CD8 T cells (P 0.001) specific IFN-+ CD8 T cells in BAL, lungs, and spleen 8 days after rVV-minigene boosting. data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 3 or 4 mice/group. a high percentage of total CD8 T cells isolated from the BAL secreted multiple cytokines, followed by those in the lungs and spleen. the proportion of IFN-+ CD8 T cells coexpressing TNF- (double producers) and TNF- and IL-2 (triple producers) was much higher in the BAL and lungs than in the spleen. data are means of cytokine-positive CD8 T cells obtained by Boolean gating. data are representative of 2 or 3 independent experiments with 3 or 4 mice/group. phenotypically distinguish virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in lung airways, lung parenchyma, and secondary lymphoid organs. the ability of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells to protect the host from lethal challenge depends on their absolute number and on their ability to produce multiple effector cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2) and cytotoxic molecules (granzyme B and perforin) the majority of virus-specific CD8 T cells in both the S436- and S525-immunized groups coproduced IFN- and TNF- but not IL-2 in the BAL and lungs. mice were rested for 42 to 45 days and then challenged with a lethal dose (5 104 PFU) of MA15. CD8 T cells from the S436- and S525-immunized groups expressed granzyme B than from control mice. CD8 T cells from the S436- and S525-immunized groups expressed higher levels of granzyme B in both the BAL (48% versus 27%, P 0.01) and lungs (53% versus 27%, P 0.001) than did cells from the control group. prime-boost-immunized mice were challenged with a lethal dose of MA15. immunization against epitope S525 protected approximately 80% of mice. nearly 60% of mice survived in the control-immunized group. data are expressed as the percent initial weight the SEM. data correspond to means for 4 mice per group SEM. arrowheads show peribronchial lymphocyte infiltration. lungs of control-immunized mice marked alveolar and bronchiolar edema with thickened alveolar septa. pathological changes were reduced in both S436- and S525-immunized mice. memory CD8 T cells generated after prime-boost vaccination enhanced virus clearance. the proportion and total number of epitope-specific CD8 T cells in PBL were similar in the DC-S436- and DC-S525-immunized groups. intranasal boosting with rVV-S436 or rVV-S525 generated a large pool of virus-specific effector CD8 T cells in the BAL, lungs, and spleen. the proportion and number of S525-specific CD8 T cells were significantly FACS plots show percentages of S436- and S525-specific IFN-+ CD8 T cells in the blood. data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 3 or 4 mice/group. the percentage and total number of S436- and S525-specific memory CD8 T cells were determined in the BAL, lungs, and spleen. the proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells among the total CD8 T cell pool was much higher for both the S436 and S525 groups in the lung airways. bar graphs show mean percentages of polyfunctional S436- and S525-specific IFN-+ CD8 T cells in the BAL, lungs, and spleen. data are means of cytokine-positive CD8 T cells obtained by Boolean gating. airways was significantly higher on S436- and S525-specific memory CD8 T cells from the lung airways (>95%) than on those isolated from the lung parenchyma (35 to 50%) and spleen (40 to 50%) CD103, another marker of resident memory T cells, was also expressed on a high proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells. both the percentage and total number of virus-specific CD8 T cells were higher in the BAL and lungs of control immunized mice than for those immunized against the S436 epitope. the majority of virus-specific CD8 T cells in both the S436- and S525-immunized groups coproduced IFN- and TNF- but not IL-2 in the BAL and lungs. IFN-+ CD8 T cells were further gated for TNF- and IL-2 expression to determine polyfunctionality in the BAL and lungs. data are representative of 3 independent experiments with 3 or 4 mice/group. histograms represent percent granzyme B+ CD8 T cells in the BAL and lungs at day 5 after MA15 challenge (A) bar graphs represent mean percentage of granzyme B+ CD8 T cells. in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed 5 days after MA15 challenge. we immunized an additional group of mice with a mixture of DC-525 and DC-436. 85% of mice survived, only marginally different from the survival occurring after S525 immunization alone. no differences in weight were observed when the groups immunized with S525 and with S436 plus S525 were compared. lungs of control-immunized mice had marked alveolar and bronchiolar edema with thickened alveolar septa. pathological changes were reduced in both S436- and S525-immunized mice. memory CD8 T cells generated after prime-boost vaccination enhanced virus clearance. our results show that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells provided substantial protection against lethal MA15 challenge. the extent of protection was dependent on the specific immunodominant epitope used for immunization. in this study, we analyzed 8- to 10-month-old infected mice because, like middle-aged humans, these mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV than younger animals. the proportion and total number of S436- and S525-specific CD8 T cells were similar at 6 days after DC-peptide immunization in the PBL and during the memory phase. however, the proportion and the total number of S525-specific CD8 T cells were significantly higher than those of S436-specific CD8 T cells after rVV-minigene boosting. intranasal immunization may be superior to systemic immunization because lung resident memory CD8 T cells are not generated if the immunogen is delivered systemically. circulating cells failed to protect against heterosubtypic challenge. emergence of MERS-CoV in humans and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in pigs highlights the need for coronavirus vaccines and antiviral agents. a strong anti-SARS-CoV antibody response will be an important goal in vaccine design."}
