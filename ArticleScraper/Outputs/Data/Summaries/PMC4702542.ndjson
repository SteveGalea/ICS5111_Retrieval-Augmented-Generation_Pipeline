{"summary": "RABV is a nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA encoding five structural proteins. the ribonucleoprotein complex contains the RNA genome tightly encapsidated by N, P, and L. both L and P are involved in the process of viral transcription and replication. RABV N has been reported to play an important role in the evasion of host RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses. studies of other NNS RNA viruses have revealed a highly conserved K-D-K-E motif within the L protein (21, 22) most recent studies have shown that VSV with defective MTase activity is highly attenuated both in vitro and in vivo. rB2c, rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A mutants did not enhance the production of IFN but were more sensitive to the expression of IFIT2 than the parent virus. BSR cells, a cloned cell line derived from BHK-21 cells, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) a fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody against RABV N was purchased from Fujirebio (Malvern, PA) pcDNA3.1-B2c was digested with ClaI and KpnI.

FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. the sections were observed under an Olympus IX51 fluorescence microscope. cells were stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies against RABV N for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. after staining, cells were washed three times with PBS. flow cytometry was performed on a BD-C6 flow cytometer. five-week-old female mice were either infected intramuscularly (i.m.) with rB2c, rB2c-K1685A, or rB2c-K1829A at a dose of 6 104 FFU, mock infected with DMEM, or inoculated i.c. with the same viruses at a dose of 104 FFU in a volume of 30 l. mouse neuroblastoma cells (NA), human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH), HEK-293T cells and HEK-293T-IFIT1/2 cells express a human IFIT1 or IFIT2 gene (29) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) cloned cell line derived from BHK-21 cells was propagated in BHK-21 cells. recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-B2c was constructed by inserting the genome of CVS-B2c into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. key amino acids (K1685, D1797, K1829, and E1867) were mutated to alanine or other amino acids by overlapping PCR. suckling mice were inoculated intracranially (i.c.) with 500 focus-forming units (FFU) of rB2c, rB2c-K1685A, or rB2c-K1829A. when paralysis developed, the mice were euthanized with CO2. rRABVs used in pathogenicity study were propagated in suckling Kunming mice. cells cultured in six-well plates were infected with rRABVs at an MOI of 5 for one-step growth curves. after 1 h of incubation, supernatants were removed, cells were washed three times with DMEM. animals were anesthetized with ether and perfused by intracardiac injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the immunohistochemistry study, the sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in xylene and ethanol. sections were heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer at 90\u00b0C for 5 min. UV-inactivated viral supernatants were then diluted 10 times in RPMI 1640 medium and were added to NA cells for 24 h. infected cells in plates were digested with 0.25% EDTA-trypsin. after staining, cells were washed three times with PBS. five-week-old female mice were either infected intramuscularly (i.m.) with rB2c, rB2c-K1685A, or rB2c-K1829A at a dose of 6 104 FFU, mock infected with DMEM, or inoculated i.c. with the same viruses. mice were observed for 21 days for clinical signs of rabies and survivorship. a two-tailed t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the infection ratio and viral titers in transgenic cell lines. the four amino acids (Lys-1685, Asp-1797, Lys-1829, and Glu-1867) within the K-D-K-E motif of rB2c were individually mutated to alanine residues. the site mutation was confirmed at the nucleotide level by RT-PCR and sequencing. mutant rRABVs rB2c-D1797 and rB2c-D1797L, rB2c-D1797T, rB2c-E1867T and rB2c-E1867Q were constructed and were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A at 48 hpi in BSR cells. florescence foci of rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A were much smaller than those of the parent virus, rB2c. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A attained peak titers (104.75 FFU/ the alanine mutation at K1685 or K1829 of the RABV L protein reduces viral transcription and replication in vitro. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A could not enhance the production of type I IFN. kinetics of vRNA demonstrated that all the viruses were unable to replicate in RAW 264.7 cells. all had similar amounts of vRNA at 12, 24, and 48 hpi. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A induced much less active IFN than rB2c. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A are more sensitive to IFN pretreatment than rB2c. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A showed highly upregulated sensitivity. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A both decreased more than 30-fold. overexpression of IFIT1 did not affect the replication of rB2c-K1685A, rB2c-K1829A or rB2c in 293T cells. overexpression of IFIT2 reduced the rate of virus replication by 60% for rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A. HEK-293T, HEK-293T-IFIT1, or HEK-293T-IFIT2 cells were infected with different viruses at an MOI of 0.5. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A exhibit attenuated pathogenicity in vivo. no virulence of rB2c-K1685A or rB2c-K1829A was detectable in the mouse brains by i.m. infection. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A induced levels of humoral immunity comparable to that with rB2c. mice infected with rB2c-K1685A or rB2c-K1829A showed no clinical signs of rabies. mice infected with rB2c succumbed to rabies. no virus, viral antigen, or viral RNA could be detected by virus titration, qRT-PCR, or IHC. 40 FFU of rB2c-K1685A and 80 FFU of rB2c-K1829A could kill 90% and 70% of suckling mice, respectively. with a low virus dose (20 FFU), 40% of rB2c-K1685A-infected mice and 90% of rB2c-K1829A-infected mice survived, a survival rate significantly greater than that of rB2c-infected mice. a conserved catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad was found in the C-terminal region of the L protein of some negative-strand RNA viruses. the recombinant RABV strain CVS-B2c (rB2c) was chosen due to its modest virulence and easy assessment of the pathogenicity in vivo. the recombinant RABVs with the indicated mutations in the K-D-K-E tetrad were rescued and were passaged in BSR cells. total RNA was isolated at the indicated passages (P1 to P4) total RNA was isolated at the indicated passages. mutant rRABVs rB2c-D1797L, rB2c-D1797T, rB2c-E1867T, and rB2c-E1867Q were constructed and were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. rRABVs began to revert to wild-type D1797 at the 3rd and 4th passages, respectively. 29A attained peak titers (104.75 FFU/ml and 103.75 FFU/ml, respectively), which were much lower than that of rB2c (107.5 FFU/ml), at 3 dpi. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A reached 106.5 FFU/ml and 105.75 FFU/ml, respectively, close to the peak titer of rB rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A could not enhance the production of type I IFN. it has been shown that 2\u2032-O MTase-defective mutants of human and mouse coronaviruses facilitate the recognition of the sensor MDA5 and enhance the production of type I IFN. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A exhibit enhanced sensitivity to type I IFN. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A are more sensitive to IFN pretreatment than rB2c. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A showed highly upregulated sensitivity. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A both decreased more than 30-fold. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A both decreased more than 30-fold. analysis of virus-infected cells by flow cytometry confirmed that IFIT2 overexpression reduced the rate of virus replication by 60% for rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A. basal mRNA level of IFIT2 in SK-N-SH and 293T cells is higher than that in BSR cells. 5- to 6-week-old mice were either mock infected or infected i.m. with 6 104 FFU of each rRABV. rB2c-K1685A- or rB2c-K1829A-infected mice showed no clinical signs of rabies and no body weight loss. five-week-old female mice were infected i.m. with 6 104 FFU of wild-type or mutant RABV. the clinical score (A), body weight loss (B), percentage of survival (C), virus titers (D), viral mRNA (E) and viral genomic RNA (vRNA) (F) in the brains and VNA titers in the sera were measured. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A are highly attenuated and exhibit no detectable virulence in adult mice. five-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 10) were inoculated i.c. with 104 FFU of wild-type or mutant RABV. clinical score (A), weight loss (B), percentage of survival (C), virus titers (D) and viral mRNA ( rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A are only modestly virulent in suckling mice. one-day-old Kunming suckling mice (n = 10) were infected i.c. with the indicated dose of rB2c (A), rB2c-K1685A (B), or rB2c-K1829A (C) the mice were monitored for 4 weeks, and the the nascent viral mRNA is first transferred as a monophosphate RNA onto a GDP acceptor by GDP PRNTase. then sequentially methylated at the ribose 2\u2032-O and N-7 positions, reversing the traditional methylation order (37). the details of mRNA modification for RABV are poorly understood, and most of the information comes from the study of VSV. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A are more sensitive to type I IFN than rB2c, suggesting that these mutants maintain IFN-based attenuation in vitro. the role of 2\u2032-O methylation has been elusive for a long time. recent studies demonstrated that IFIT1 and -2 could specifically inhibit virus replication by recognizing viral mRNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation. however, in our present study, we found that IFIT1 overexpression could not significantly inhibit the replication of rB2c-K1685A or rB2c-K1829A in 293T cells. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A mutant RABVs display undetectable virulence but elicit humoral immunity comparable to that with the wild type. rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A exhibit enhanced sensitivity to IFIT1 and -2 inhibitory activity."}
