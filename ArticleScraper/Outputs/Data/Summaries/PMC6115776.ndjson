{"summary": "redox biology embraces events involving shift of balance between reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) production and their scavenging. changes of redox status take place during various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, signaling, and metabolism. chronic viral hepatitis B and C are generally associated with oxidative stress. levels of ROS and oxidized metabolites correlate with the severity of liver damage and with the risk of the development of related pathologies. redox biology pays much attention to localization of ROS sources. three IVs are infectious for humans, namely types A, B, and C. the IV genome consists of eight segments (seven for influenza C virus) encoding 9\u201311 proteins. these proteins include the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), three subunits of RNA polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2), two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NEP), and two matrix proteins (M1 and human respiratory syncytial virus belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of RNA viruses. the viral genome is represented by a single-stranded negative-sense 15.2 kb RNA encoding 11 proteins. HRSVs are classified as A or B genotypes, according to the structure of fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins. HRV replicates at 33\u201335 \u00b0C, thus it mostly infects nose epithelial cells. sometimes rhinoviral infection leads to more severe disease, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease. therapy of infection is mostly supportive. the IV genome consists of eight segments (seven for influenza C virus) encoding 9\u201311 proteins, depending on the type of virus. these proteins include the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), three subunits of RNA polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2), two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NEP) and two matrix proteins (M1 and a selective proton channel protein M2) human respiratory syncytial virus belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of RNA viruses. the viral genome is represented by a single-stranded negative-sense 15.2 kb RNA encoding 11 proteins. HRSVs are classified as A or B genotypes, according to the structure of fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins. antivirals with preventive mode of action were in clinical trials. none of them were approved and recommended for HRV therapy. parainfluenza virus belongs to the same Paramyxoviridae family. in patients infected with IV marked increases in DNA (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine), lipid (malondialdehyde, F2-isoprostane, 7-ketocholesterol, and 7-hydroxycholesterol) oxidation products in blood plasma and urine were reported. increased levels of ROS as well as of nitric oxide synthase 2 (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine content representing markers of nitrosative stress were also reported in reduced antioxidant capacity, another marker of oxidative stress, was detected in HRSV-infected infants, mice, and cells. reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes were also reported in airway cells and in mice replicating human HMPV [37,41]. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NADPH oxidases, Nox), dual oxidase (Duox) and xanthine oxidase (XO) also contribute to the production of superoxide anion by Nox2. respiratory RNA viruses induce nox2-mediated ROS production in endosomes of alveolar macrophages. recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes from the bloodstream to the infection site may contribute significantly to the enhanced production of superoxide anions by Nox2 during the infection. survival of IV-infected mice with inactive Nox1 was prolonged [63], suggesting that nox1 is a source of ROS that is hazardous. in HRV-infected polarized airway epithelial cells nox1-derived ROS are responsible for triggering barrier dysfunction, a dangerous process leading to decreased transepithelial resistance. this process leads to decreased transepithelial resistance, thus making the host susceptible to bacterial pathogens. redox regulation of type 1 and 3 interferon (IFN) antiviral response pathways in airway cells. similar data also exist for other viruses. fink et al. described elevation of transcripts encoding Duox2, Nox4, and a regulatory subunit of Nox2-p67phos in cells infected with SeV and HRSV. XO catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and further to uric acid thus being implicated in the catabolism of purine nucleic bases. XO levels were observed in serum, lung tissues, and in bronchoalveolar wash fluid of IV-infected mice [73,74]. mitochondria are known to be an important source of O2\u2022 in IV infection due to the virus-induced leakage of electrons from the respiratory chain the same group described a mechanism of O2\u2022 formation for IV and SeV. it involves the induction of iNOS, production of nitric oxide, formation of nitroguanosine, and the latter together with iNOS and P450 reductases leads to the production of this type of ROS. such data are missing for any other virus that triggers oxidative stress. a single paper suggests that the generation of ROS is augmented by the viral fusion (F) protein. treatment with DPI abrogates ROS production in F-expressing cells suggesting the involvement of NADPH oxidase. the role of NADPH-oxidases remains to be explored. the Nrf2-regulated target genes are superoxide dismutases, catalase, peroxiredoxins, and glutathione peroxidases. the peroxiredoxin family comprises six different members with redox-active cysteine residues. GPx4 and Prdx6 are capable of neutralizing lipid peroxides. an increase in SOD1 expression was found in patients with asymptomatic influenza A infection [96]. similar controversy exists over other antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) Nrf2 deficiency leads to activation of the NFB pathway and subsequent cytokine production. a transient activation has been reported during the first several hours post infection in lung carcinoma cells in vitro. HRSV NS1 protein prevented the activation of the JAK/STAT1 pathway. decreased expression of genes bearing GAS and ISG promoter sequences. however, SOD2 gene expression is normally induced by NFB rather than by IFN signaling. Nrf2 and Nrf1 knockout animals have distinct phenotype meaning that functions of these two factors do not fully overlap. there are no data about status of Nrf1 during respiratory as well as other viruses. induction of type I and III interferons is likely to be achieved through the Nrf2 pathway. IV also enhances production of interferons 1 (IL29), and 2/3 (IL28A/IL28B) again via ROS. the balance between pro- and anti-viral activities of NFB remains to be analyzed. an interesting piece of evidence came from an investigation of SeV and its effects on the expression of Duox2 [115]. treatment with nox inhibitors abrogates STAT and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted) induction [116]. Specifically, HRSV- and SeV-induced activation of NFB and IRF3 signaling is initiated by sensing viral RNA by Rig-I and MDA5 helicase receptors. scavenging pathways that are caused by respiratory viral infections are implicated in inflammation, lung epithelial disruption, and tissue damage. inflammation can contribute to lung damage and epithelial dysfunction and vice versa. GPx1 was shown to play a particular role in the pathogenicity of IV infection. direct data shows that IV interferes with selenium metabolism and expression of key Se-metabolizing proteins. contradictory data also exist for SARS-CoV [85,135] and HRSV [32]. cytokine storm is responsible for lung tissue damage during viral respiratory infections. cytokine storm is responsible for lung tissue damage during viral respiratory infections. cytokine storm is responsible for lung tissue damage during viral respiratory infections. induction of IL8 by RSV abolishes NFB activation and cytokine production in infected cells. a precise action of ROS in induction of proinflammatory cytokines is less clear. RANTES activates different types of immune cells in lung inflammatory infiltrates during HRSV infection. it was recently shown that other proteins of the inflammatory response, namely cytokine high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), were also upregulated by HRSV infection. production of cytokines is controlled by proteolytic cleavage of precursor polypeptides into active cytokines. inflammasomes contain sensor molecules connected to caspase 1 via a specialized adaptor protein. a majority of complexes contain NOD-like receptor molecules, among which the bestcharacterized is NLRP3. a pathological consequence of enhanced production of ROS in the presence of respiratory viruses is a barrier dysfunction. HRV disrupts airway epithelial barrier function with a consequent increase of barrier leakage and susceptibility to pathogens. authors did not investigate link between sensitivity to bacterial infection and disruption of epithelial resistance. infection leads to enhanced ROS production that may trigger cell death and subsequent macrophage activation. proinflammatory cytokines could also be produced by infected cells via activation of redox-sensitive nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) pathway. the most studied agents targeting ROS that were evaluated for treatment of IV and HRSV infections are listed in Table 1. the most studied antioxidants\u2014NAC, ascorbic acid and vitamin E were shown to have positive effects such as decrease of virus replication and inflammation in cells and mice. ambroxol Mice Yes ND [202] ND ND Resveratrol Cells Mice Yes ND [203] Cells Mice Yes ND [204,205] Vitamin E or Trolox Cells Mice No ND [32] * No antiviral activity [31]; antiviral activity was reported [32,143,189]. fected mice thus validating perspectiveness of antioxidant therapy of IV. PDTC inhibits HRV replication and the processing of the viral polyprotein. other well studied antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, Trolox, 2-mercaptoethanol, and NAC, do not display any promising therapeutic activity. many studies showed the positive role of antioxidant therapy in infected cells and animals. almost no relevant clinical data exist even for popular antioxidants."}
