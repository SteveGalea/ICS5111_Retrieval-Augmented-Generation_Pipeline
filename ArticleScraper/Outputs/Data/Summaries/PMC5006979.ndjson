{"summary": "the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors such as TLR7 within virally infected cells and/or specialized secreting cells induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the inability of IFNR-deficient mice to control a myriad of viral infections highlights the importance of an intact type I IFN signaling system in vivo. CD8+ T cells lacking T1IFN receptor fail to adequately expand in vivo during certain primary viral infections. the requirement for functional IFN/ signaling upon CD8+ T cells is not nearly as severe. if memory CD8+ T cells function in vivo is similarly predicated upon T1IFN signaling is not clear. T1IFN exerts disparate and pleiotropic influences on both the immune system and most somatic cells. conventional methods include germline and/or conditional knockout models that would limit requisite IFN signaling during primary viral infection are inappropriate means to assess whether memory responses to virus are similarly dependent upon IFN/-signaling. long-term LCMV immune mice (>6 weeks post primary LCMV-Arm) were rechallenged with LCMV. plasma was collected prior to, and at indicated times following the secondary viral infection. within 48\u201360 hours of secondary viral infection, both IFN and IFN became readily detectable within the plasma of infected mice. spleens of LCMV-immune mice were bred with IFNRfl/fl mice. IFNR ablation could be induced in vivo at any time selected by the investigator. nave mice were treated with tamoxifen and challenged with LCMV-Arm. tamoxifen exposure should ablate IFNR expression. tamoxifen exposure should ablate IFNR expression. mice should recapitulate findings with conventional germline IFNR knockout mice. tamoxifen-treated nave Cre+IFNRf/f mount primary responses. LCMV naive mice were injected with tamoxifen. 9 weeks later, they were given a primary infection with LCMV. genomic DNA was isolated from purified splenocytes, lymph nodes, liver, heart, kidney, lung, and brain. the status of the IFNRf/f locus was assessed using PCR primers. in all of the tissues analyzed, near-complete deletion of IFNR was observed. zsGreen-expressing CD8+ T cells from tamoxifen-treated Cre+ mice failed to upregulate phospho-Stat1 following IFN exposure. tamoxifen treatment of tamoxifen-treated mice results in widespread deletion of IFNR. the efficiency of Cre activation in T cells of LCMV-immune mice was determined. splenocytes were harvested and incubated with each of the four indicated peptides. the red numbers indicate zsGreen+ cells as percentage of all CD8+ T cells. LCMV-immune mice were treated with tamoxifen, then rechallenged with LCMV-Arm. LCMV specific CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells were identified and enumerated using standard intracellular cytokine staining. after 24 hours, virus specific T cells were reduced approximately 4- to 10-fold in Cre- mice. IFNR deletion prior to secondary viral infection does not limit LCMV-specific T cell attrition. LCMV immune UBC-CreERT2+ and UBC-Cre-ERT2-IFNRfl/fl mice were injected with LCMV or given a sham injection. secondary expansion, long term maintenance, and qualitative changes of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are not reliant upon T1IFN signaling Previous reports have documented severe deficits in the ability of IFNR deficient memory CD8+ T cells to undergo secondary expansion. no difference in attrition (day 2 p.i.), secondary expansion (days 5 & 10 p.i.) or the establishment of long-term 2\u00b0 memory (days 14 & 23 p.i. LCMV-specific memory T cells become predominantly monofunctional (capable of producing only one cytokine) soon after secondary viral infection. their multifunctionality is restored over the following 2\u20133 weeks. the ability of CD8+ (E) and CD4+ (F) memory T cells to produce IFN, TNF, and IL-2 was examined using a standard ICCS assay at days 2, 5, 14, and 23 following secondary challenge. the loss of multifunctionality in memory cells soon after secondary infection, and its gradual restoration, are shown by the relative proportion, at each time point, of cells that are capable of producing one, two or three cytokines. mice were sacrificed and zsGreen-positive and -negative virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were enumerated using intracellular cytokine staining. for all epitopes, >90% of the responding cells were zsGreen+, suggesting that zsGreen-negative cells did not have a marked selective advantage over the course of the recall response. if this were the case, and if IFNR provided a selective advantage, one would reporter-negative (IFNR-intact) CD8+ or CD4+ memory T cells do not preferentially expand during the recall response. zsGreen mice were generated, treated with tamoxifen, and subjected to secondary LCMV infection. tamoxifen-induced Cre activation of LCMV-immune mice leads to widespread ablation of IFNR. previous work has indicated that adoptively-transferred memory cells derived from nave IFNR-deficient TCR transgenic cells were unable to control secondary LCMV infection. antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can mount protective antiviral recall responses. reduced T1IFN-inducible gene expression does not limit viral control within the spleen or liver during secondary viral infection. IFN and IFN levels were assessed via ELISA or multiplex assay. expression of both cytokines waned dramatically within 48\u201360 hours of infection. RNA was extracted and subjected to PCR array analysis. LCMV-immune mice at 12 hours p.i. were normalized to equivalent analyses of sham infected mice (sham n = 6, 12 hrs n = 4). IFNR ablation could be induced in vivo at any time selected by the investigator. mice treated with tamoxifen should ablate IFNR expression. tamoxifen-treated nave Cre+IFNRf/f mount primary responses. LCMV-specific T cells were enumerated by standard intracellular cytokine staining. LCMV naive UBC-Cre-ERT2+IFNRfl/fl and UBC-Cre-ERT2-IFNRfl/fl mice were injected with tamoxifen and 9 weeks later were given a primary infection with LCMV. LCMV vRNA was quantified within the spleens of Cre+ and Cre- mice (n = 2). tamoxifen-mediated Cre activation in t lymphocytes was observed in Cre+ and Cre- IFNRf/fzsGreen+/wt mice, generated as described in materials and methods. in Cre- mice, as expected, CD8+ memory T cells specific for each of the indicated epitopes were identified, and the cells did not express zsGreen. tamoxifen treatment of LCMV-immune mice results in widespread deletion of IFNR, both within peripheral organs and LCMV-specific memory T cells. tamoxifen treatment of zsGreen-expressing CD8+ T cells resulted in the widespread deletion of IFNR. splenocytes were harvested and incubated with each of the four indicated peptides. the red numbers indicate zsGreen+ cells as a percentage of all CD8+ T cells (No Peptide groups) or of virus-specific (i.e., IFN+) cells. LCMV-immune mice were treated with tamoxifen, then rechallenged with LCMV-Arm. LCMV specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified and enumerated using standard intracellular cytokine staining. after 24 hours, virus specific T cells were reduced approximately 4- to 10-fold in Cre- mice. a-1 expression was not reliant upon IFNR signaling. both Cre+ and Cre- DbGP33-41 + and Db NP396-404 + specific memory CD8+ T cells expressed similar levels of Qa-1 throughout the first 24 hours of infection. deletion of IFNR from previously-normal virus specific memory T cells does not spare them from attrition during secondary viral infection. secondary expansion, long term maintenance, and qualitative changes of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are not reliant upon T1IFN signaling. previous reports have documented severe deficits in the ability of IFNR deficient memory CD8+ T cells to undergo secondary expansion [20,22], and this was attributed to their failure to escape NK cell mediated attenuation [20,22] MV-specific memory T cells become predominantly monofunctional (capable of producing only one cytokine) soon after secondary viral infection. their multifunctionality is restored over the following 2\u20133 weeks. the findings are recapitulated for both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. the ability of CD8+ (E) and CD4+ (F) memory T cells to produce IFN, TNF, and IL-2 was examined using a standard ICCS assay at days 2, 5, 14, and 23 following secondary challenge. the loss of multifunctionality in memory cells soon after secondary infection, and its gradual restoration, are shown by the relative proportion, at each time point, of cells capable of producing one, two or three cytokines. enumerated using intracellular cytokine staining. for all epitopes, >90% of the responding (i.e., IFN+) cells were zsGreen+, suggesting that zsGreen-negative cells did not have a marked selective advantage over the course of the recall response. MV-immune Cre reporter mice were generated, treated with tamoxifen. tamoxifen-treated mice were subjected to secondary LCMV challenge. tamoxifen-treated Cre+ mice were able to control the challenge. IFNR-deficient memory cells exhibited normal kinetics of attrition, expansion, and secondary memory formation. previous work has indicated that adoptively-transferred memory CD8+ T cells derived from nave IFNR-deficient TCR transgenic cells were unable to control secondary LCMV infection. antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can mount protective antiviral recall responses. reduced T1IFN-inducible gene expression does not limit viral control within the spleen or liver during secondary viral infection. a tamoxifen-sensitive inducible system was developed to delete IFNR from all cells. the results validated our investigation of the impact of these cytokines on memory T cells. we used an inducible deletion model in which both potential confounders are nullified. the profound biological impact of tamoxifen administration indicated that in vivo Cre-mediated deletion of floxed IFNR DNA must be efficient, but also that it must have led to the rapid and widespread loss of any existing functional IFNR. we confirmed that the genetic disruption of IFNR was accompanied by the rapid cessation of receptor function. LCMV-specific IFNR-deficient memory CD8+ T cells upregulated both MHC class I and Qa-1 in vivo. this suggests that NK-mediated killing may not contribute to the cells\u2019 rapid attrition. but our data indicate that there is functional redundancy in memory T cells. in contrast to the primary immune response, T1IFN signaling plays a key supporting role in T cell expansion. we considered the possibility that such pressures may have promoted selective expansion of the few memory cells that had evaded tamoxifen-induced Cre activation prior to secondary LCMV infection. previous work showing that the antiviral effector function of IFNR-deficient memory CD8+ T cells is defective in vivo [22]. we questioned whether the inducible deletion of IFNR had no significant impact on the containment and ultimate clearance of a secondary viral infection. fewer defects in IFN signaling (and related pathways) have been reported in humans. fewer defects in T1IFN responses (and related pathways) have been reported in humans. some examples, in humans, of mutations that disrupt T1IFN responses. a genetic defect is present prior to the primary infection. the memory T cell response is intrinsically abnormal, presumably because they arose and developed in the absence of T1IFN signaling. however, such memory cells cannot reliably be used to assess how individual genes affect the recall T cell response. Cre+ and Cre- mice were injected with 3 successive daily i.p. doses of 2mg of tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil. at least two weeks were allowed to elapse after tamoxifen injection before the mice were rechallenged with LCMV-Arm (2x106 PFU i.p.)
