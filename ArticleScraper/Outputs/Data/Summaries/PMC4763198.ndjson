{"summary": "mice were kept in a temperature (21 2 \u00b0C) and humidity (60 5%) controlled room. mice were fed a standard mice chow and water ad liblitum. all experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. the ischemia/reperfusion time was set up according to our experience in our pilot study. all mice were performed a fluid resuscitation with intraperitoneally injection of 1.0 ml of normal saline. filtration, intra-alveolar hemorrhage/debris and cellular hyperplasia16. total lung injury score was calculated by adding the scores in each of these categories. grade 0\u2014Normal mucosal villi. grade 3\u2014Massive epithelial lifting down the sides of villi. ISA kits specific for mouse TNF-, IL-6, IL-1 NF-B p65, IB- and HMGB-1. cytokine levels were measured in triplicate and then averaged. Western blotting Tissues were washed with PBS and then homogenized in lysis buffer. the survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at a 2-tailed P value 0.05. mice were kept in a temperature controlled room on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. the ischemia/reperfusion time was set up according to our experience in our pilot study. all mice were performed a fluid resuscitation with intraperitoneally injection of 1.0 ml of normal saline. the lung injury was assessed to the level of absent, mild, moderate, or severe injury (score 0\u20133) by observing the presence of exudates, hyperemia/congestion, neutrophil infiltration, intra-alveolar hemorrhage/debris and cellular hyperplasia. the intestinal injury was scored on a scale from 0 to 5 as described by Chiu et al17. genates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 g and supernatants were used for cytokine determination. cytokine levels were measured in triplicate and then averaged. the survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. results Fenofibrate ameliorates intestine injury after intestinal I/R. the intestine still had the appearance of moderate edema. the fenofibrate treated mice were presented with significantly lesser expression level of NF-B p65 in the small intestine compared with the vehicle treated mice after intestinal I/R. fenofibrate administration showed protective effects. inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, HMGB-1 (A\u2013D) and apoptotic variables of NF-B p65 (E) and I B (F) were measured by ELISA. values were normalized to total cellular protein. serum levels unit sham Ischemia/reperfusion fenofibrate vehicle TNF- pg/ml 4.3 1.1 7.9 1.8*# 25.4 1.9# IL-1 12.2 3.3 40.0 3.6*# 96.1 3.5# IL-6 25.3 4.0 33.9 4.3*# 98.0 3.7# ALT U/L 21.2 4.8 51.2 5.7*# 72.8 8.6# To induce intestinal I/R injury, the superior me the lung tissue expression of NF-B p65 was significantly suppressed in the fenofibrate group compared with the vehicle group. the pulmonary expression level of caspase-3 was significantly up-regulated in the vehicle group after intestinal I/R. fenofibrate administration significantly decreased expression level of caspase-3 compared to the vehicle groups.
