{"summary": "mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, murine rotavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, MHV, MPV, minute virus of mice (MVM), murine norovirus (MNV), pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, Sendai virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. mice were housed in IVC (70 cages per rack) under positive pressure. individual fecal pellets were collected from the anus of each mouse. pools of 6 to 10 pellets were collected from soiled bedding. the nape, abdomen, and rump of mice were swabbed by using sterile swabs. RT\u2013PCR analysis for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was performed by using primers LCMVS710 (5\u2032 AGG CTC AGA TGG CAA GAC C 3\u2032) and LCMVS1641 (5\u2032 GCC CAA ATG TTG TGA CAC TCT 3\u2032). mycoplasma pulmonis PCR analysis used MYPUL180 (5\u2032 TTA GAT CGC ATG ATT TAG AT 3\u2032) and MYP cellophane tape tests were performed by applying tape to the perianal region of the mouse. the adherent surface of the tape was placed onto a glass microscope slide. slides were observed by using a microscope at 10 and 40 magnification. unanesthetized 4-wk-old female SW index mice (n = 36) were inoculated orally with 300 ID50 of MPV1d (20 L of a 10% spleen stock) 36 unanesthetized 4-wk-old female SW index mice were inoculated orally with 3000 ID50 of MHV-Y (20 L of a 10% colon stock) mice were housed in 36 cages, with each cage containing one MPV-inoculated PCR analysis was performed on the 4 samples to determine if infectious agents had previously been deposited on the prefilter. soiled bedding was removed by 'dumping' the bedding from the contaminated cages into the ABDC. cages were then scraped prior to loading into the tunnel washer. the final set of 16 cages was washed at either 110 or 180 \u00b0F. a 4-wk-old female SW sentinel mouse was placed into each cage. feces and blood were collected for PCR analysis and serology. the extra 3 pet-store mice were housed separately as replacements for pet-store mice that might become ill during the study. feces from pet-store mice were tested for Helicobacter spp., pinworms, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. pinworm- and Helicobacter-infected mice (11 pet-store mice and the 23 remaining SW contact mice) were placed individually in 34 cages. a second set of 68 nave 4-wk-old female SW mice were distributed among the 34 cages. 102 mice totaled at a density of 3 mice per cage. pools of feces were collected from each cage for PCR analysis. each cage had detectable levels of Helicobacter spp. and pinworm DNA on their surfaces prior to cage washing. soiled bedding was dumped into the ABDC and cages were scraped. the first 16 cages were washing by using a wash temperature of 110 \u00b0F. the steam system was activated and the water in the tank was heated to 180 \u00b0F. the final 7 cages were not washed and served as positive-control cages. mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, murine rotavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, MHV, MPV, minute virus of mice (MVM), murine norovirus (MNV), pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, Sendai virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. mice were housed in IVC (70 cages per rack) under positive pressure. s,24 and experimental procedure were in accordance with federal policies and guidelines governing the use of vertebrate animals. individual fecal pellets were collected from the anus of each mouse, and pools of 6 to 10 pellets were collected from soiled bedding. the nape, abdomen, and rump of mice were swabbed by using sterile Hydraflock swabs. RT\u2013PCR analysis for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was performed by using primers LCMVS710 (5\u2032 AGG CTC AGA TGG CAA GAC C 3\u2032) and LCMVS1641 (5\u2032 GCC CAA ATG TTG TGA CAC TCT 3\u2032) mycoplasma pulmonis PCR analysis used MYPUL180 (5\u2032 TTA GAT CGC ATG ATT TAG AT 3\u2032) and MYP cellophane tape tests were performed by applying tape to the perianal region of the mouse. the adherent surface of the tape was placed onto a glass microscope slide. slides were observed by using a microscope at 10 and 40 magnification. unanesthetized 4-wk-old female SW index mice (n = 36) were inoculated orally with 300 ID50 of MPV1d (20 L of a 10% spleen stock) 36 unanesthetized 4-wk-old female SW index mice were inoculated orally with 3000 ID50 of MHV-Y (20 L of a 10% colon stock) mice were housed in 36 cages, with each cage containing one MPV-inoculated PCR analysis was performed on the 4 samples to determine if infectious agents had previously been deposited on the prefilter. soiled bedding was removed by 'dumping' the bedding from the contaminated cages into the ABDC. cages were then scraped prior to loading into the tunnel washer. the final set of 16 cages were not washed and served as positive-control cages. after cage washing at either 110 or 180 \u00b0F, cages were reassembled, transported back to the animal room, and placed on the IVC rack to dry for 2 h. the extra 3 pet-store mice were housed separately as replacements for pet-store mice that might become ill during the study. feces from pet-store mice were tested for Helicobacter spp., pinworms, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, MAV, MHV, MNV. on day 30, pinworm- and Helicobacter-infected mice were placed individually in 34 cages. a second set of 68 nave 4-wk-old female SW mice were distributed (2 per cage) among the 34 cages. 102 mice totaled at a density of 3 mice per cage. each cage was swabbed, and PCR analysis was performed to confirm that all cages had detectable levels of Helicobacter spp. and pinworm DNA. soiled bedding was dumped into the ABDC, and cages were scraped prior to loading into the tunnel washer. the first 16 cages were washing by using a wash temperature of 110 \u00b0F. after which the steam system was activated and the water in the tank was heated to 180 \u00b0F. the final 7 cages were not washed and served as positive-control cages. 16 soiled cages were washed at 110 \u00b0F, and 16 soiled cages were washed at 180 \u00b0F. a substantial amount of each virus should have accumulated in the soiled bedding and on the cage surfaces. PCR analysis of feces collected individually from the 108 index mice detected MPV in 94% and MHV in 98% of the mice. a significant (P 0.005) difference between unwashed and 180 \u00b0F washed cage groups Testing of cages for viral contamination. 36 cages were swabbed, just prior to removal of the soiled bedding. the presence of MPV and MHV in soiled bedding was confirmed by testing of dust and debris that was aerosolized during soiled bedding disposal. PCR-based testing of 4 samples of the dust and debris present on the prefilter of the ABDC after soiled-bedding disposal from the cages housing MPV- and MHV-infected mice detected MHV and MNV RNA as well as MPV and Helicobacter spp. DNA. the detection of MHV RNA and MPV DNA in all postdumping samples indicates that the accumulation of MHV particles in aerosolized dust and debris was sufficient to be detectable by all serologic samples from 32 sentinel mice, 21 d after exposure to unwashed cages, were negative for MPV and MHV. PCR of feces collected from 3 of the 4 sentinel mice, 7 d after exposure to unwashed cages, were positive for MPV and MHV. one of the unwashed cages did not transmit MPV or MHV. infection with Helicobacter spp. was detected in all mice. infection with A. tetraptera and S. obvelata was detected in 2 mice. pet-store mice also infected with myocoptes musculinus. PCR evaluation of lungs from the 21 SW mice euthanized between days 22 and 37 detected parvovirus in 100%, M. pulmonis in 82%, and Pasteurella pneumotropica in 23% of mice but not Pneumocystis murina,Mycobacteriaspp., cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, MHV, Sendai virus, or pneumonia virus of mice. cage swab 14/16 14/16 5/7 Pinworm fecal pool 7/16 (7S/0A) 10/16 (8S/2A) 1/7 (1S/0A) parvovirus fecal pool 16/16 16/16 7/7 Parvovirus cage swab 15/16 14/16 7/7 MAV fecal pool 0/16 2/16 0/7 MHV fecal pool 16/16a,b 11/16a 3/7b. monis in 44%, and S. obvelata in 92% of mice. direct observation of cecal contents detected pinworms in 90% of mice. cecal observation detected several other intestinal parasites. no significant difference was detected between groups for any agent Table 4 Testing for parasites in Helicobacter spp. and pinworm contact-infection mice 4 to 5 d after cage washing. fecal-pool PCR assay on day 50 and of cage-swab PCR analysis on day 51 was significantly different only for MHV (P 0.005) the presence of infectious agents in soiled bedding was confirmed by testing of dust and debris generated during the dumping of soiled bedding. the presence of infectious agents in soiled bedding was confirmed by testing of dust and debris generated during the dumping of soiled bedding. the 8 dust and debris samples were extracted by adding 1 mL PBS to the 1.5-mL tube containing the debris, followed by adding 100 L of the buffer\u2013debris mixture to the lysis buffer. all 5 direct-extraction samples were positive for Helicobacter spp., parvovirus, M. pulmonis, S. obvelata, and Myocoptes musculinus DNA but not MAV DNA. Helicobacter spp., MVM, and MAV DNA and MHV RNA were not detected in the feces or ceca from sentinel mice exposed to unwashed cages. serology performed on the sentinels revealed a low level of infection by MVM and MHV and a higher level of infection by MPV. cal and cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Helicobacter cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Pinworm cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Helicobacter cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Helicobacter cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Pinworm cecal PCR 0/16a 0/16b 5/7a,b Pinworm tape test 0/16a 0/16b 5/7a the equation used to determine the steam energy (in 1 million British thermal units [MMBTU]) per year required to heat domestic hot water is: Note that additional steam is used to maintain approximately 50 gal of water within the wash tank and rinse tank at approximately 200 \u00b0F continuously (8760 h per year. the total potential savings is 75% 2220 MMBTU = 1665 MMBTU = US$23,310 annually. the total potential savings is 75% 2220 MMBTU = 1665 MMBTU. experimental infection with MNV was attempted but was unsuccessful.

PCR-based testing of 4 samples of dust and debris collected from the prefilter of the ABDC prior to soiled bedding disposal from the cages housing MPV- and MHV-infected mice. the detection of MHV RNA and MPV DNA in all postdumping samples indicates that the accumulation of MHV particles in aerosolized dust and debris from the 16 cages\u2019 worth of soiled bedding was sufficient to be detectable. tests of SW sentinels exposed to washed and unwashed cages were visibly \u2018dirty\u2019. PCR analysis of feces collected from the 32 sentinel mice, 7 d after exposure to washed cages, were all negative for MPV DNA and MHV RNA. feces collected from 3 of the 4 sentinel mice, 7 d after exposure to unwashed cages, were positive for MPV and MHV. all mice inoculated with MHV became infected. all but one mouse inoculated with MPV became infected. experimental infection with MNV was attempted but unsuccessful. the presence of MPV and MHV in soiled bedding was confirmed by testing of dust and debris that was aerosolized during soiled bedding disposal. PCR-based testing of 4 samples of the dust and debris collected from the ABDC prefilter indicated the presence of MNV RNA and Helicobacter spp. DNA in all 4 samples but not MPV DNA or MHV RNA. f, and ATP levels of 1 to 99 (mean,16) were detected in 16 cages washed at 110 \u00b0F.

PCR analysis of feces from individual mice (33 SW and 11 pet-store mice) on day 22 detected Helicobacter spp. DNA in 98% of mice, S. obvelata in 93% of mice, and A. tetraptera in 4.5% of mice. postmortem testing of SW mice exhibiting clinical disease. Helicobacter spp. DNA in 97% of cages, pinworm DNA in 46%, parvovirus DNA in 100%, and MHV RNA in 77% (Table 2). PCR analysis of pools of feces or swabs collected from cages housing Helicobacter spp. serology, PCR, cecal observation, and tape tests were performed. serology detected antibodies specific for MPV in 82%, MVM in 13%, MHV in 99%, and M. pulmonis in 61% of the mice. contact-infection mice 4 to 5 d after cage washing 180 \u00b0F wash 110 \u00b0F wash Unwashed MPV serology 25/31 26/29 10/14 MVM serology 6/31 3/30 1/14 Parvovirus fecal PCR 9/31 7/28 3/14 MHV serology 30/30 30/30 13/14 MAV fecal PCR 1/31 4/28 0/14 M. pulmonis lung PCR 13/ no significant difference was detected between groups for any agent Initial testing of pet-store mice. fecal and fur-swab PCR analysis of feces from individual mice. fur-swab PCR analysis on day 23 detected myocoptes musculinus DNA in 93% of mice. myobia musculi DNA in 73% of mice and lice eggs on 41% of mice. postmortem testing of SW mice exhibiting clinical disease. PCR analysis of pools of feces or swabs collected on the day prior to cage washing from cages housing Helicobacter spp. and pinworm contact-infection mice. 78 SW and pet-store mice were euthanized 4 to 5 d after cage washing on days 55 to 56. PCR analysis performed on feces, ceca, or lungs detected nucleic acids specific for Helicobacter spp. in 97%, parvovirus in 26%, MHV in 47%, M. pulmonis in 44%, and S. obvelata in 92% of mice. direct observation of cecal contents detected pinworms in 90% of mice, with A. tetraptera detected in 16% of mice, and pinworm larva of unknown species in PCR 9/31 7/28 3/14 MHV serology 30/30 30/30 13/14 MHV fecal PCR 16/31 15/28 3/14 MAV serology 0/31 3/30 0/14 M. pulmonis lung PCR 13/32 14/32 7/14 Helicobacter cecal PCR 31/32 31/32 14/14 Helicobacter fecal PCR 24/31 24/28 9/14 Data are given we swabbed 39 cages on day 51, just prior to removal of soiled bedding from the cages. Helicobacter spp. DNA was detected on 85% of cages, pinworm DNA on 69%, and parvovirus DNA on 92% of cages. MHV RNA and MAV DNA were not detected in any of the 5 samples collected from the ABDC after dumping of soiled bedding. the majority of mice housed in cages were infested with pinworms and fur mites. DNA from these agents was not PCR-amplified from these prefilter samples. parvovirus and S. obvelata DNA were detected in the feces of only one sentinel housed in an unwashed cage. the difference between the percentage of infected sentinels housed in washed compared with unwashed cages was significant (P 0.005) only for MPV and pinworms. unwashed MPV serology 0/16a 0/16b 5/7a,b MVM serology 0/16 0/16 1/7 Parvovirus cecal PCR 0/16a 0/16b 4/7a,b MVM fecal and cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 MHV fecal and cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Helicobacter cecal PCR 0/16 0/16 0/7 Pinworm ce calculations were based on washer operating time estimates of 6 h daily, 5 d each week, 52 wk yearly (2080 h annually) steam is used to boost domestic hot water (approximately 140 \u00b0F) to a final rinse temperature of approximately 200 \u00b0F (T = 60 \u00b0F) potential savings are 583 MMBTU and US$8162 annually. additional savings associated with \u2018stand-by\u2019 steam use and energy costs can be assessed further. more than half of the pet-store mice were infested with A. tetraptera. only 14% of the pet-store mice became infested with A. tetraptera. tetraptera eggs are released intermittently over a 3- to 4-wk period. they are not infective for 5 to 8 d after excretion in the feces. PCR and visual observation of cecal contents from SW mice were significantly better at detecting pinworm infections. pinworm PCR primers used were designed to amplify both S. obvelata and A. tetraptera. observation of cecal contents detected A. tetraptera in 14% of the index mice. contact-infection study was not intended to measure transmission of M. pulmonis. more than half of contact-exposed mice seroconverted to M. pulmonis. lungs from almost half of the contact-exposed mice were positive for M. pulmonis DNA. but results showed that M. pulmonis was not transmitted by unwashed cages. PCR in 91% of contact exposed pet-store and SW mice, it was not transmitted to sentinels housed in unwashed cages. 2 other studies have shown efficient transmission by soiled bedding to sentinel mice in 8 to 19 wk. mice in the first study were infested with both Myobia musculi and Myocoptes musculinus. inel is a promising adjunct to sentinel-exposure programs for early pathogen detection. the ability to reliably detect \u2018excluded\u2019 pathogens from an ABDC would allow for screening of large portions of a facility by using a few filter samples. a recent study showed that fur-mite DNA can be detected on swabs from a horizontal manifold of an IVC rack housing a single cage of fur mite infested mice one week after placement of the cage on the rack. it appears that smaller agents such as viruses and Helicobacter spp. are readily washed from the debris. indirect extraction resulted in sufficient quantity of nucleic acids for detection by PCR analysis. a threshold level of contaminated bedding needs to be present on the ABDC prefilter. further studies to determine the sensitivity of this testing paradigm are needed. the effectiveness of washing at 110 \u00b0F is an important finding. manufacturer steam requirements are critical to understand the full range of savings associated with washer operating parameters. direct steam metering is not trivial in these settings but is required for more precise energy cost-savings estimates."}
