{"summary": "influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing (8, 9) despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing (8, 9) despite increasing vaccination rates, there are four antiviral drugs licensed for use in the united states. influenza A virus causes seasonal disease, regular epidemics, and more rarely pandemics. the features of influenza A viruses that enable pandemics are thought to include the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase introducing mutations, antigenic drift in the surface glycoproteins. virus ribonucleoproteins (vRNA) genome, nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerases (PA, PB1, PB2) are subsequently imported into the nucleus via cellular importin- (26\u201328) nuclear export of influenza virus vRNPs has been shown to be mediated by host exportin 1 (XPO1) interaction with nuclear export signal (NES)-containing viral nuclear export protein associated with vRNPs (29, 32, 33) in the nucleus, XPO1 forms a quaternary complex with the cargo protein, Ran-GTP, and Ran-BP3. the role of Ran-BP3 is to promote nucleotide exchange by Ran-GEF RCC1 and to increase the affinity of XPO1 for Ran-GTP and the transported cargo. XPO1 inhibitors show minimal cytotoxicity to normal cells. verdinexor showed good tolerability in rats, dogs, and nonhuman primates. a closely related compound, selinexor, is currently in multiple phase I and II trials of human patients with advanced solid and hematological malignancies. influenza virus strains A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/California/04/09 (pH1N1), A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1; mouse adapted), A/Philippines/2/82-X79 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1204/04 (H5N1; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [LPAIV]) the level of infectious virus was measured at 48 h postinfection (hpi) by titer determination of A549 cell supernatant on MDCK cells (54, 55) for virus titer determinations, culture supernatants were serially diluted and titers were determined on MDCK cells for 72 h. cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) equivalent protein amounts were diluted in SDS sample buffer (4 buffer contained 40% glycerol, 240 mM Tris HCl [pH 6.8], 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, and 5% -mercaptoethanol) cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline prior to the titration of verdinexor with the Hewlett-Packard (HP) D300 Digital Dispenser (Tecan) (57) 2 h before infection. cells were then infected with influenza virus strains at an MOI of 0.01. ell Signaling Technology antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C and then incubated for 1 h with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or an Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) secondary antibody. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with the Verso cDNA synthesis kit and random hexamers as primers. cDNA were synthesized from total RNA with the Verso c PCR analysis was performed with RT2 SYBR green qPCR master mix (SABiosciences) and primer sets specific to the corresponding influenza virus RNA (59) in an MX3005P thermocycler. the abundance of viral RNA was normalized to GAPDH, and its expression relative to that in mock-treated samples was calculated. exor-treated mice infected with 10 50% lethal doses (LD50) of influenza virus A/California/04/09 (mouse-adapted pH1N1) perfused with 10% (wt/vol) buffered formalin. formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (4 m thick), and mounted on glass slides. a score of 0 is defined as unremarkable. influenza A virus strains A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Vietnam/1204/04 (H5N1; HPAIV) were propagated in 9-day-old embryonic chicken eggs. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting human XPO1 and MEK and a nontargeting siRNA were used. the level of infectious virus was measured at 48 h postinfection (hpi) by titer determination of A549 cell supernatant on MDCK cells (54, 55) for virus titer determinations, culture supernatants were serially diluted and titers were determined on MDCK cells for 72 h. cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) equivalent protein amounts were diluted in SDS sample buffer (4 buffer contained 40% glycerol, 240 mM Tris HCl [pH 6.8], 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, and 5% -mercaptoethanol) verdinexor was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for dose-response virus inhibition experiments, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline prior to the titration of verdinexor. cells were then infected with influenza virus strains at an MOI of 0.01. clear factor kappa B (NF-B) p65 monoclonal (Cell Signaling Technology) antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C and then incubated for 1 h with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or an Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) secondary antibody. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with the Verso cDNA synthesis kit. qPCR analysis was performed with RT2 SYBR green qPCR master mix (SABiosciences) and primer sets specific to the corresponding influenza virus RNA (59) in an MX3005P thermocycler. the abundance of viral RNA was normalized to GAPDH. or five mice per group of normal mock-infected mice and diluent- or verdinexor-treated mice perfused with 10% lethal doses (LD50) of influenza virus A/California/04/09 (mouse-adapted pH1N1) formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (4 m thick), and mounted on glass slides. a549 cells were transfected with a nontargeting siRNA (siNEG) or a siRNA targeting human XPO1. a siRNA targeting MEK was used as a positive control. XPO1 siRNA (siXPO1)-transfected cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis. siNEG-transfected cells were infected with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (B, C), A/California/04/09 (pH1N1) (D), A/Philippines/2/82-X79 (H3N2) (E), A/mute swan/MI/451072-2/06 (H5N1) (F), A/red knot/NJ/1523470/06 (H7N3) (P cells were fixed, stained for viral NP (green) and nuclei (DAPI; blue) at 48 hpi, culture supernatants were collected for virus titer determination in MDCK cells. data are expressed as the mean SE (n = 6). XPO1 has been previously reported to mediate the nuclear export of influenza virus vRNPs (29, 32, 33) the baseline (DMSO) and the maximum observed cytotoxicity were determined by the nonlinear regression method. a549 cells were pretreated with DMSO as a control or with increasing concentrations of verdinexor ranging from 0.1 to 100 M in one-third-log increments. two hours posttreatment, cells were inoculated with the influenza A and B virus strains listed in Table 1. the percent cytotoxicity in verdinexor-treated cells was determined relative to that in nontreated (0% cytotoxicity) and lysed (100% cytotoxicity) cells and graphed to evaluate the median cytotoxic concentration. XPO1 facilitates the nuclear export of influenza virus vRNP. vRNP is crucial for influenza virus replication in host cells. inhibition of XPO1-dependent nuclear export by its prototypical inhibitor LMB has been shown to result in accumulation of vRNPs in the nuclei of infected cells. RNA and positive-sense mRNA in the cytoplasm and nucleus were evaluated by strand-specific viral RNA RT-qPCR. cells pretreated with verdinexor demonstrated 56.6-fold enrichment of nuclear negative-sense vRNA relative to that of DMSO-treated cells. relative abundance of cytoplasmic negative-sense vRNA was significantly reduced. vRNP nuclear retention observed in Fig. 3A to C was due to inhibition of vRNP nuclear-cytoplasmic export in cells treated with verdinexor. the majority of verdinexor-treated cells displayed nuclear NP localization that was extended through the 12- and 18-hpi time points. localization of a non-NLS/NES-bearing viral protein, M2, was not affected by treatment with verdinexor or LMB. cells were mock treated or treated with verdinexor (1 M) for 6 h. ten percent input and eluate from the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE. intensities of verdinexor-treated relative to mock-treated bands for each strain are indicated below the blot. verdinexor is a slowly reversible inhibitor of XPO1-dependent influenza virus replication in vivo. its ability to disrupt XPO1-NEP complex formation in the absence of other viral factors was also evaluated. treatment medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. cells were incubated for different lengths of time prior to infection with influenza virus A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 0.01. treatment of cells up to 24 h prior to infection was as efficacious as treatment at 2 h preinfection. treatment at 36 h prior to infection resulted in a significant virus titer reduction. verdinexor was given orally by gavage at 10 mg/kg (30 mg/m2) or i.v. at 5 mg/kg (15 mg/m2). plasma verdinexor concentrations were determined with a validated ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry method. the mean concentration at each time point postadministration was assessed. mice were pretreated with diluent only or 10 or 20 mg/kg verdinexor for 1 day (1Rx), 2 days (2Rx), or 3 days (3Rx) prior to inoculation with 10 MID50 of mouse-adapted influenza virus strain A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1). prophylactic administration of 10 mg/kg verdinexor at 1 day prior to infection significantly reduced lung A/Philippines/2/82-X verdinexor treatment at 72 hpi or treatments at 24 and 72 hpi significantly reduced lung influenza virus burdens. treatment with verdinexor at 24 and 72 hpi (P 0.001) or twice daily at 72 hpi (P 0.05) significantly reduced lung influenza virus titers. oral oseltamivir and diluent-only treatments were used as positive and negative controls. mice were infected with 10 MID50 of A/California/04/09 (mouse-adapted pH1N1) or A/Philippines/2/82-X79 (H3N2) (C, F) mice were treated orally with diluent only or 20 mg/kg verdinexor prophylactically. they were then challenged with 10 MID50 of mouse-adapted influenza virus A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1). expression of key NF-B-dependent proinflammatory cytokines was evaluated by RT-qPCR. verdinexor treatment reduces pulmonary disease pathogenesis and death associated with lethal influenza A virus challenge. mice were prophylactically treated with diluent only or verdinexor. diluent-treated mice were mock treated orally with verdinexor. diluent only (verdinexor; C, E, F) or treated with 20 mg/kg verdinexor daily for 3 days. mock-treated mice showed an absence of viral antigen. at 48 hpi in mock-treated mice, there was viral antigen staining of the bronchiolar epithelium. mice were orally mock treated with diluent only (verdinexor; C, E) or treated with 20 mg/kg verdinexor daily for 3 days. they were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with H&E at 48 (C, D) and 96 (B, E, F) hpi for histopathology evaluation. verdinexor-treated mice were mock infected with influenza virus. bronchioles had no evidence of epithelial apoptosis and had no cells in the lumen. bronchiolar epithelium had areas of apoptotic cell death but few changes. mice treated with verdinexor but not infected with virus had no detectable pathological changes in their lungs or tracheas. the bronchial epithelium had areas exhibiting mild to high levels of cell death, areas of hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, and karyorrhexis or karyolysis characteristic of apoptosis. by 96 hpi, there was a higher degree of multifocal ulceration mice were infected with a lethal dose (10 LD50) of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1) and treated orally with diluent only. body weight, clinical signs, and survival were monitored daily for 14 days. n.s., not significant (relative to the oseltamivir-treated, virus-infected group); n.s., not significant (relative to the diluent-treated, virus-infected group); n.s., not significant (relative to the oseltamivir-treated, virus-infected group). culture supernatant was collected at 48 hpi to measure infectious virus production. cells transfected with siXPO1 displayed significantly lower influenza virus replication. siNEG-transfected cells were harvested at 96 h posttransfection. at 48 hpi, cells were fixed, stained for viral NP (green) and nuclei (DAPI; blue) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. XPO1 has been previously reported to mediate the nuclear export of influenza virus vRNPs. verdinexor, a novel SINE, is efficacious against influenza A and B viruses. a549 cells were treated with increasing doses of verdinexor. the verdinexor concentration that resulted in a median cytotoxicity between the baseline (DMSO) and the maximum observed cytotoxicity was determined by the nonlinear regression method. verdinexor is efficacious against influenza A and B virus strains. icacy of verdinexor in vitro warrants an evaluation of its in vivo efficacy. verdinexor inhibits nuclear export of vRNP. XPO1 facilitates the nuclear export of influenza virus vRNP. vRNP is crucial for influenza virus replication in host cells. verdinexor-treated cells were harvested at 8 hpi and subjected to subcellular fractionation and RNA isolation to extract cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs. the relative abundance of negative-sense vRNA and positive-sense mRNA in the cytoplasm and nucleus were evaluated by strand-specific viral RNA RT-qPCR. however, no significant difference in the relative abundance of nuclear and cytoplasmic positive-sense viral mRNA was observed between RNA from both fractions was used for RT-qPCR analysis. RNA from both fractions was used to determine the relative nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of influenza virus vRNA (B) or mRNA (C) the abundance relative to that in mock-infected cells was graphed. bars, 200 m. (C) 293T cells were transfected with a NEP expression plasmid derived from influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/California/04/09 (pH1N1), or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) at 48 h posttransfection, cells were mock treated or treated with verdinexor (1 M) for 6 h. a/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) was observed to replicate with faster kinetics than A/WSN/33 (H1N1), which may account for the higher concentration of verdinexor required to effectively suppress virus replication. the results strengthen the findings on verdinexor's activity to block the nuclear export of the vRNP of various influenza virus A strains. verdinexor is a slowly reversible inhibitor of XPO1-dependent influenza virus replication in vitro. it acts as a slowly reversible inhibitor of XPO1; thus, the length of verdinexor's inhibitory effect against influenza A virus infection was subsequently evaluated. culture supernatants collected at 48 hpi for virus titer determination. n.s., not significant; **, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001 (relative to mock-treated infected cells) drug concentration in serum; Tmax, time when Cmax was observed; AUClast, area under plasma drug concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity; F, percent bioavailability. mice were pretreated with diluent only or 10 or 20 mg/kg verdinexor for 1 day (1Rx), 2 days (2Rx), or 3 days (3Rx) prior to inoculation with 10 MID50 of mouse-adapted influenza virus strain A/California/04/ verdinexor has in vivo antiviral activity with an ability to reduce lung virus titers that is similar to or better than that of a standard oseltamivir regimen. verdinexor has in vivo antiviral activity with an ability to reduce lung virus titers that is similar to or better than a standard oseltamivir regimen. the efficacy of in vivo prophylactic (A to C) and therapeutic (D to F) verdinexor treatment was evaluated. Mice were treated orally at 24, 72, or both 24 and 72 hpi. oral oseltamivir and diluent-only treatments were used as positive and negative controls. verdinexor treatment lowered the expression of gamma interferon (Ifng); tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf); interleukin-1 (Il1b; Fig. 7D; P 0.01) and interleukin-6 (Il6; Fig. 7E; P 0.05) to basal levels. mice were treated orally with diluent only or 20 mg/kg verdinexor daily for 3 days prior to infection with 10 MID50 of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1) Lungs were collected at 96 hpi, and total RNA was isolated. diluent-treated mice were prophylactically treated with diluent only or verdinexor. no virus-positive cells were detected in the lungs of mock-infected mice treated with verdinexor. mice were mock treated orally with diluent only (verdinexor; C, E) or treated with 20 mg/kg verdinexor daily for 3 days. the bronchiolar wall was ulcerated and there was extensive antigen staining of the bronchiolar epithelium. there was also viral antigen staining of epithelial cells of the alveolar septa. however, viral antigen staining in the alveolar septa was minimal. 4 is marked, diffuse bronchiolar epithelial changes with perivascular, peribronchiolar, and alveolar inflammation. data are expressed as the mean SE of four or five mice per group. bronchioles had no evidence of epithelial apoptosis. bronchial and peribronchiolar inflammation was observed. the parenchyma had few areas of inflammation that obliterate the alveoli. bronchioles; P, parenchyma; V, vessel; arrows, peribronchiolar inflammation. perivascular and peribronchial inflammation was substantially lower in verdinexor-treated mice than in diluent-only-treated mice. findings further support the ability of verdinexor to reduce influenza virus-mediated disease pathology and inflammation. mice were infected with a lethal dose (10 LD50) of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09 (MA-pH1N1). a group of mice were treated with 10 or 20 mg/kg of verdinexor every other day at 24 and 72 hpi. survival was evaluated daily for 14 days. n.s., not significant (relative to the diluent-treated, virus-infected control group); n.s., not significant (relative to the oseltamivir-treated, virus-infected group). XPO1 inhibition results in altered kinetics of virus production. inhibition of XPO1/Rev-mediated viral RNA transport also arrests human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription. also inhibits the production of new HIV-1 virions. numerous tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) such as p53, p73, p21, p27, FOXO1, FOXO3a, PP2A, BRCA1, and E2F4 (35, 41, 77) export of these proteins from the nucleus by XPO1 prevents multiple TSPs from acting in the absence of DNA damage or other oncogenic insults. a related SINE compound, selinexor, is currently undergoing multiple in addition to influenza virus, SINE compounds have also been shown to inhibit the replication of several other viruses, such as HIV (78), hepatitis C virus, and rabies virus. a related SINE compound, KPT-350, is currently undergoing preclinical investigation for its anti-inflammatory activity as an inhibitor of NF-B (IB) verdinexor-treated mice showed reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, inflammation, and disease pathology following influenza virus infection. this additive treatment effect can ultimately lead to better overall disease outcomes and survival of influenza virus-infected mice. this additive treatment effect can lead to better overall disease outcomes and survival of influenza virus-infected mice. the IC50 of verdinexor was >30 M. these studies indicate the selectivity of verdinexor and its safety for potential use in humans."}
