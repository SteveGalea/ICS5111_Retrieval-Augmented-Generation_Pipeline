{"summary": "type I interferons are critical innate cytokines that limit viral replication and dissemination prior to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. the innate antiviral response has to be controlled to minimize cell injury and maintain cellular homeostatic functions. ISG encodes both direct antiviral factors as well as PRR and signal transduction components, such as IRF7 and STAT1. this amplification loop thus elevates the ability of cells to induce and respond to IFN/. oligodendroglia appear to express a limited TLR repertoire at basal levels compared with microglia. however, little is known about responsiveness of distinct CNS cell types to viral infections in vivo. JHMV infection causes acute encephalomyelitis, which resolves into a persistent infection of the spinal cord associated with demyelination. in addition to oligodendroglia, JHMV also infects microglia and infiltrating macrophages during acute infection. however, neuronal and astrocyte infection is sparse. glia populations were isolated directly from the CNS to monitor changes in mRNA expression. these results are the first to imply an inherent paucity in IFN/ transcription by oligodendroglia. the dependence of oligodendroglia on IFN/ from other cellular sources highlights the potent monitoring functions of microglia. mice were housed and bred under pathogenfree conditions at an accredited facility at the Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic. all procedures were in compliance with animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CNS infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia distinguished by staining with antiCD45 (30F11), and antiF4/80 mAb (Serotec, Raleigh, NJ) oligodendroglia from IFNAR/ and Wt control mice were identified by consecutive staining with unconjugated O4 mAb and antimouse IgM (PE mAb) cells were purified on a BD FACSAria (BD cDNA was synthesized using a DNA FreeTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) cDNA was synthesized using a buffer containing 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 250 ng random hexamer primers and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) IFNAR2c (transmembrane), F,5\u2032GGCAGTGACAGTGAGA3\u2032, and R,5\u2032CTGGCTGAGGTGTCAGAGGT3\u2032. expression levels of Adar1, Gapdh, Ifna4, Ifn, Ifit2, Irf3, Irf7, Irf9, Stat1, Tlr3 and Tlr7 were determined by using TaqMan primer and. PCR reactions were performed in 10 L final reaction volumes containing specific master mix, 1 mM concentrations of each primer mix, and 4 L of cDNA using the ABI 7500 fast PCR and 7500 software. all reactions were initiated by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were backcrossed six times with C57BL/6 mice prior to use. mice at 6\u20137 weeks of age were infected via intracerebral injection. spinal cords from six to seven mice were finely minced, digested in PBS containing 0.25% trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. trypsin quenched by addition of 20% new born calf serum. cells collected from the 30%/70% Percoll interface were washed with RPMI medium containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) oligodendroglia from IFNAR/ and Wt control mice were identified by consecutive staining with unconjugated O4 mAb and antimouse IgM (PE) mAb (R660.2) (BD Pharmingen) cells were purified on a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences), resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at 80\u00b0C. cDNA was synthesized using a DNA FreeTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) cDNA was synthesized using a buffer containing 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 250 ng random hexamer primers and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) PCR reactions were performed using the 7500 fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) all TaqMan reactions were initiated by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. expression levels of Adar1, Gapdh, Ifna4, Ifn, Ifit1, Ifit2, Irf3, Irf7, Irf9, Stat RNA was isolated from increasing cell numbers starting with as few as 7,500 up to 240,000 cells. a minimum of 30,000\u201340,000 cells were thus used for real time PCR analysis. oligodendroglia and microglia were isolated from spinal cords of uninfected PLPGFP mice by FACS based on their respective CD45 GFP+ and CD45lo/int F4/80+ phenotypes. basal levels of PRR mRNAs are low in resting CNS relative to lymphoid tissue. Mda5 and RigI transcripts were vastly increased in oligodendroglia. mRNAs encoding the endosomal PRR TLR3 and TLR7 were also induced. mRNAs encoding the endosomal PRR TLR3 and TLR7 were also induced in oligodendroglia. oligodendroglia are limited in basal and inducible expression of viral RNA sensing PRRs. microglia and oligodendroglia purified from spinal cords of nave (A) or JHMV infected (B) PLPGFP mice were assayed for Mda5, RigI, Tlr3 and Tlr7 transcripts. the absence of IFN/ signaling abrogated upregulation of Mda5 and RigI transcripts in both microglia and oligodendroglia. oligodendroglia respond to exogenous IFN/ in vivo, similar to microglia. the contribution of infected oligodendroglia and microglia to IFN/induction was assessed in vivo. viral loads were monitored by measuring viral mRNA encoding the N protein. despite subsiding by Day 7 p.i., viral mRNA levels remained significantly elevated relative to microglia. oligodendroglia do not induce IFN/ transcripts during JHMV infection. the failure of oligodendroglia to induce Ifn/ following infection suggested that MDA5 and RIGI are not activated. oligodendroglia were examined for expression of mRNAs encoding IKK, IRF3 and IRF7. microglia from nave mice expressed higher basal Ikk transcripts compared with oligodendroglia. Irf3 mRNA was readily detected at basal levels in both microglia and oligodendroglia from nave mice. but induction was more modest and occurred delayed in oligodendroglia. oligodendroglia Induce ISG Delayed Relative to Microglia Upregulation of the ISGs RigI, Mda5, Tlr3 and Irf7 support the notion that oligodendroglia respond to IFN/ following infection. oligodendroglia is exposed to limiting amounts of IFN/ in the microenvironment. Stat1 and Irf9 levels were also elevated in microglia compared with oligodendroglia derived from nave mice. STAT1 is inducible by both IFN/ and IFN, while IRF9 is constitutively expressed in most non CNS cell types. microglia and oligodendroglia from nave or JHMV infected mice assayed for transcripts encoding the IFNAR1, soluble IFNAR2 (IFNAR2a) and IFNAR2 transmembrane (IFNAR2c) chains (A) or Stat1 and Irf9 transcripts (B) oligodendroglia express lower steady state levels of ISGs. delayed ISG expression in oligodendroglia indicated a more prominent responsiveness to IFN than IFN/. ifn expression was maximal at 2 h and Ifn4 mRNA was elevated between 2 and 12 h post poly I:C inoculation. peak induction of the ISGs Ifit1 and Ifit2 was delayed until 12 h. Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNA induced in oligodendroglia at 4 h were lower than in microglia, but were sustained at 12 h post poly I:C administration. oligodendroglia showed tentative and delayed ISG induction. oligodendroglia and microglia purified from spinal cords at 4 or 12 h post poly I:C injection were injected intracerebrally with 200 g poly I:C to assess kinetics of Ifn, Ifn4, Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNA induction in spinal cords. spinal cords were used as donor tissue based on higher oligodendroglia yields compared with brains. basal levels of PRR mRNAs are low in resting CNS relative to lymphoid tissue, with exception of Tlr3. Mda5 mRNA levels in oligodendroglia remained overall lower compared with microglia. mRNAs encoding the endosomal PRR TLR3 and TLR7 were also induced. peak expression was delayed relative to microglia. microglia and oligodendroglia purified from spinal cords of nave (A) or JHMV infected (B) PLPGFP mice were assayed for Mda5, RigI, Tlr3 and Tlr7 transcripts at the indicated times p.i. absence of IFN/ signaling abrogated upregulation of Mda5 and RigI transcripts in both microglia and oligodendroglia. oligodendroglia respond to exogenous IFN/ in vivo, similar to microglia. IFN/induction was assessed in vivo by comparing Ifn and Ifn4 mRNA relative to viral replication in each population. Viral loads were monitored by measuring viral mRNA encoding the N protein, the most abundant viral RNA in infected cells. the levels increased 20 fold relative to microglia by Day 5 p.i. microglia and oligodendroglia purified from nave or JHMV infected PLPGFP mice were assessed for JHMVN, Ifn, and Ifn4 transcripts. the failure of oligodendroglia to induce Ifn/ following infection suggested that MDA5 and RIGI are not activated. Irf3 mRNA was readily detected at basal levels in both microglia and oligodendroglia from nave mice, but tended to decline following infection. induction was more modest and occurred delayed in oligodendroglia following infection. oligodendroglia is exposed to limiting amounts of IFN/ in the microenvironment. optimal induction was delayed and absolute levels were not as robust as in microglia. oligodendroglia is exposed to limiting amounts of IFN/ in the microenvironment. STAT1 is inducible by both IFN/ and IFN, while IRF9 is constitutively expressed in most non CNS cell types. oligodendroglia increased 10 fold by Day 3 p.i. and remained elevated until day 7 p.i. in microglia. data in (A) represent the average of two experiments; data in (B) represent the average of three independent experiments SEM as indicated in Fig. 1. oligodendroglia express lower steady state levels of ISGs. oligodendroglia require paracrine IFN/ signals to induce ISG. microglia and oligodendroglia from nave or JHMV infected mice were assayed for Pkr, Oas2, Adar1 and Ifit2 transcripts. peak induction of the ISGs Ifit1 and Ifit2 was delayed until 12 h. cell typespecific gene analysis of IFN/ and ISG after intracerebral poly I:C injection was thus performed. oligodendroglia at 4 h were lower than in microglia, but were sustained at 12 h. results supported by isolating microglia and oligodendroglia from nave adult mice. oligodendroglia and microglia purified from spinal cords at 4 or 12 h post poly I:C injection. expression of Ifn4, Ifn, Mda5, RigI, Ikk, Irf7, Ifit1 and Ifit2 transcripts. DISCUSSION PRR initiated innate responses in the CNS. despite high load of viral RNA, discrepancy likely reflects differences in expression and/or induction of IFN/ pathway components. even poly I:C did not induce Ifn/ in oligodendroglia in vivo or ex vivo. f3 transcripts were only reduced by 50%, and Irf7 levels were barely detectable in either cell population. reduced basal PRR levels in oligodendroglia were reminiscent of sparsely expressed PRRs in primary neurons. this concept is consistent with the inability of primary cultured neurons and astrocytes to induce IFN/ expression following MHV infection. induction above basal levels was greater in oligodendroglia than microglia. peak expression for many genes did not correlate with maximum Ifn/ mRNA levels. peak expression for many genes did not correlate with maximum Ifn/ mRNA levels. oligodendroglia is a dominant source of IFN/ within the CNS during JHMV induced encephalomyelitis. a direct response to infection by microglia is supported by the correlation between peak viral and Ifn/ mRNA, prior to infiltration of T cells. crine IFN/ contributes to rapid control of virus in this cell type. oligodendroglia were initially infected to a lesser extent than microglia. viral RNA increased over 2 logs between Days 3 and 5 p.i. our findings contradict the hypothesis suggesting that virus initiated IFN/ production by oligodendroglia drives inflammatory responses during viralinduced demyelinating disease. our data thus support the notion that oligodendroglia are defensive players under inflammatory conditions. microglia from spinal cords of mice injected intracerebrally with poly I:C for 4 h were FACS purified. RNA was separately isolated from decreasing cell numbers as indicated. data are representative of 10 pooled mice from a single experiment."}
