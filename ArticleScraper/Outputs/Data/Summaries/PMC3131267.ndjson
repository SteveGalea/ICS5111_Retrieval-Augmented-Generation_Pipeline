{"summary": "MHV-3 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. it produces strain-dependent disease profiles that depend on infection route, age, genetic background, and immune status of the host. MHV-3 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC), two immunoregulatory molecules, were identified as ligands for PD-1. engagement of PD-1 with its ligands mediates negative signaling events via recruitment of phosphatases. PD-1 signaling has also been shown to modulate the balance between antimicrobial immune defense and immune-mediated tissue damage. a number of pathogenic microorganisms exploit the PD-1 signal in order to evade host immune responses and to establish persistent infection. the influence of PD-1 signal activity has been studied in several infection models, but there are no data available concerning the role of this pathway in FH. PD-1 expression was enhanced on multiple subsets of immune cells, including the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK1.1+ NK cells and CD68+ macrophages. PD-1-positive cells were also observed in the lung, heart and kidney. small and discrete foci of necrosis with sparse polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration were observed in liver tissues from PD-1-deficient mice after 24 h of infection. the damaged areas of PD-1-deficient mice had enlarged and confluent necrosis had become evident. by 72 h of infection, the damaged region in PD-1-deficient mice had extended throughout the entire liver. PD-1-deficient mice showed higher mortality rates associated with MHV-3 infection. all of the PD-1-deficient mice died within four days after infection. 38% of the WT mice survived up to the end of the 15-day survey period. PD-1-deficiency resulted in higher mortality after MHV-3 infection. PD-1-deficient mice (n = 11) and WT littermates (n = 13) were infected with MHV-3 (10 PFU) survival rate was monitored for a total of 15 days. occasional FGL2-positive cells were detected in the livers of PD-1-deficient mice at 24 h post-MHV-3 infection. Western-blot was used to verify the higher FGL2 protein level in the livers of PD-1-deficient mice. higher FGL2 expression and stronger fibrinogen deposition in the liver of PD-1-deficient mice after 72 h of MHV-3 infection. expression of FGL2 and fibrinogen deposition in damaged liver tissues was measured. level of fibrinogen deposition was more robust in livers from PD-1-deficient mice. expression of FGL2 was analyzed in the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. fluorescent dual staining was performed on spleen tissues. results showed that FGL2 was principally associated with CD11c-positive dendritic cells (DCs), CD68-positive macrophages and CD31-positive endothelial cells. absence of PD-1 signaling can result in enhanced FGL2 expression in thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and serum of PD-1-deficient mice after MHV-3 infection. MHV-3 infection induced high levels of IFN- and TNF- mRNA in PD-1-deficient mice. expression of PD-1 in liver, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes was detected by fluorescent dual staining. qPCR revealed that the transcription of the IFN- gene in liver was significantly higher in PD-1-deficient mice. in PD-1-deficient spleen, the transcription of both IFN- and TNF- was rapidly enhanced upon MHV-3 exposure. the fact that IFN- and TNF- both have the capacity to initiate FGL2 expression may explain why higher FGL2 expression was observed. regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice after MHV-3 infection is regulated by IFN- and TNF- mAbs. reduced FGL2 level by IFN- and TNF- mAbs treatment resulted in reduced liver damage (indicated by AST and ALT levels) cellular expression was localized to the cell membrane and in the cytoplasma. PD-1-positive cells were distributed throughout the medulla and cortex of the thymus and lymph nodes. in infected liver, more PD-1-positive cells were present in the portal and parenchymal areas. phages and NK1.1+ NK cells in the indicated organs after 72 h of MHV-3 infection were measured by FACS. the number indicates the percentage of positive cells in the indicated gate. a representative of three experiments yielded similar results. the architecture of other organs, including the heart, kidney and lung was relatively normal. PD-1 deficiency led to enhanced pathological damage by MHV-3 in the liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus. the architecture of the liver from PD-1-deficient mice and WT littermates at different time points after MHV-3 infection was compared. PD-1-deficient mice showed higher mortality rates associated with MHV-3 infection. all of the PD-1-deficient mice died within four days after infection. PD-1-deficiency resulted in higher mortality after MHV-3 infection. 5.72-fold higher level was present in liver from PD-1-deficient mice after 72 h of MHV-3 infection. level in PD-1-deficient liver was 2.01-fold higher than that in the uninfected group at this time point. expression of FGL2 and fibrinogen deposition in the liver was detected by fluorescent dual staining. the deposition of fibrinogen in the liver of PD-1-deficient mice and WT controls at 0 h, 48 h and 72 h post MHV-3 infection. expression of fgl2 in the spleen of PD-1-deficient mice significantly increased. levels of fibrinogen deposition also increased in response to infection. levels of fgl2 present in serum was found to increase rapidly after infection. the differential serum FGL2 level between PD-1 deficient and WT mice infected with MHV-3 was measured by ELISA. blue color indicates nuclear DAPI staining. previous studies have shown that the secretion of FGL2 can be triggered by the pro-inflammatory factors IFN- and TNF- [21], [22] qPCR revealed that the transcription of the IFN- gene in liver was significantly higher in PD-1-deficient and WT mice in response to MHV-3 infection. RNA and its protein levels were completely inhibited by 48 h after injection of anti-IFN- and anti-TNF- mAbs. the tissue necrosis (Fig. 7C) and liver damage (as indicated by ALT and AST levels) in PD-1-deficient mice were also significantly reduced. PD-1 signaling is best known for its ability to inhibit or dampen the immune response. some studies have indicated that this signal might also participate in regulating acute infections [23], [24], [25], [26], but its functions in this disease condition are much less clear. we used a mouse FH model mediated by MHV-3 infection to describe the effects of PD-1 in this disease process. murine FH induced by MHV-3 is a recognized and validated model for studying host resistance/susceptibility to human hepatitis virus. it has been proposed as a critical mediating factor of lethality in the MHV-3-induced mice due to the fact that it has the capacity to induce fibrinogen deposition, which in turn activates the coagulation cascades. targeted deletion of fgl2 or PD-1 leads to impaired T cell activity. expression of PD-1-positive cells in the liver, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes did not co-express FGL2. PD-1 signaling has the capacity to inhibit IFN- and TNF- secretion from PD-1-positive immune cells. the secretion of FGL2 from naturally occurring CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) was demonstrated. deficiency of Treg-produced FGL2 resulted in increased effector T cell proliferation. treatment with FGL2-specific antibodies reversed MHV-3-induced liver injury and mortality in vivo. mice were infected with MHV-3 (10 PFU) and treated with a combination injection of anti-IFN- (200 g/mouse per day, clone: R4-6A2, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and anti-TNF- (200 g/mouse per day, clone: MP6-XT22, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) anti-IFN- and anti-TNF- blocking mAbs or rat IgG1 control mAbs were injected everyday for a total of 6 days. antigen retrieval was performed in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 120\u00b0C for 10 min. photomicrographs were obtained in high-power fields (hpf, 0.625 mm2). the distribution of PD-1-, FGL2- or Foxp3 in thymus and lymph node is restricted in medulla. analysis of tissue damage was based on H&E staining. cells were then treated with Brefeldin A solution (BFA) for 4 h. FITC-NK1.1, FITC-CD3 or PE-IFN- mAbs (eBioscience) were added and the solution incubated for an additional 1 h. qPCR was performed to quantitatively analyze the gene transcription levels of fgl2, IFN- and TNF- genes. the primers for fgl2 were: sense 5\u2032-TCAAGTGGCATAGATGTGGAAG-3\u2032, and anti-sense 5\u2032-CGCTTATGTTTTGTGTCTGG-3\u2032. Statistical analysis All results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. unpaired student's t-test (two-tailed) or the Mann-Whitney test (GraphPad Prism 4.03 software) was used to analyze the mortality rate. p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. tissues were isolated for hematoxylin and eosin staining to detect damage. fgl2 mRNA transcription measured by qPCR. anti-IFN- and anti-TNF- blocking mAbs or rat IgG1 control mAbs were injected everyday for a total of 6 days. isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated (1100, Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA) or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1200, Zymed) sections incubated with secondary antibodies only were used as isotype controls. photomicrographs were obtained in high-power fields (hpf, 0.625 mm2) eBioscience used primary antibodies (PE-PD-1, FITC-CD4, FITC-CD8, FITC-NK1.1 and FITC-CD68. eBioscience) to analyze the source of IFN- in the liver, PD-1-deficient and WT mice were treated with 10 PFU MHV-3. after 72 h, liver tissues were isolated and mechanically homogenized, lymphocytes were collected thereafter. qPCR was performed to quantitatively analyze gene transcription levels of fgl2, IFN- and TNF- genes. qPCR was performed at 95\u00b0C for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 15 s. PD-1-positive cells in lung, kidney and heart tissue of MHV-3 infected mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. the arrow indicates the PD-1-positive cells. Magnification 600. NS: not significantly different. the number of Foxp3-positive cells in the liver, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes was not changed significantly in PD-1-deficient mice after MHV-3 infection. blue color indicates nuclear DAPI staining."}
