{"summary": "Host proteases have been described to play important roles in many viral activities such as entry, uncoating, viral protein production and disease induction. cellular proteases are putative targets for the development of antivirals that inhibit their activity. the inhibitory effect was also observed with other RSV isolates A1998/3\u20132 and A2000/3\u20134. the time point at which treatment with the inhibitor was most potent coincided with the expected moment of entry of the virion with the host cell."}
