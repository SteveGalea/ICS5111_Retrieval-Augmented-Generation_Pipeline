{"summary": "the international ENCODE project has established that 75% of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs but only 2% of these transcripts are translated into proteins. the enormous energetic cost required for such massive transcription of the genome cannot be simply explained by random association of RNA polymerases to DNA. the genome of multicellular eukaryotes is mostly comprised of non-coding DNA. non-coding DNA is transcribed into different classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that include structural RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs) and regulatory RNAs. small non-coding RNAs are between 20 and 50 nucleotides long. small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs) [18] that guide rRNA modifications, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that guide rRNA modifications, transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) that modulate local epigenetic structure to regulate transcription factors localization [19] and promoter-upstream transcripts (prompts) transcribed from genomic regions located approximately 0.5 to 2.5 kilobases upstream of active transcription start sites [20 single-cell analysis could overcome this problem by opening new opportunities in the fields of developmental biology [21,22,23], cancer biology [24,25,26], immunology [27,28,29] and neurology [23]. single-cell approaches may allow a better understanding of their function and of their involvement in complex processes associated with cell\u2013cell communication. lncRNAs are transcribed from genomic regions between coding genes. lncRNAs are not inserted in any protein-coding loci. lncRNAs are transcribed similarly as mRNAs by RNA pol II. about 40% of lincRNAs expressed in HeLa cells, human foreskin (hFFs) and human lung (hLFs) fibroblasts were associated with protein complexes involved in chromatin-modifying enzymes. transcripts identified as lincRNAs were annotated in the human (17,908 according to Ensembl GRCh38.p13), mouse (100,074 according to Ensembl GRCm38.p6), rat (100, chromatin interacting lncRNAs allow chromatin modifications. miRNA sponging lncRNAs reduce the availability of miRNAs to modulate the expression of their mRNA target. lncRNAs are transcribed from DNA regions with enhancing functions. lncRNAs are transcribed from the first intron of the coding gene Flowering Locus C (FLC) it is required for the vernalization-mediated epigenetic repression of FLC itself. the latter synthesizes for messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (sno about 40% of lincRNAs expressed in human foreskin, human foreskin and human lung fibroblasts were associated with protein complexes involved in chromatin-modifying enzymes. lincRNAs can be further divided into groups depending on their transcription orientation compared to the closest protein-coding gene. genic lncRNAs are overlapped to coding sequences. chromatin interacting lncRNAs allow chromatin modifications permitting the correct localization of modifying enzymes. lncRNAs can also code for micropeptides. lncRNAs are transcribed from the first intron of the coding gene Flowering Locus C (FLC) it is required for the vernalization-mediated epigenetic repression of FLC itself. the latter synthesizes for messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs rRNAs are the major structural constituents of the ribosome. prokaryotic ribosomes contain three different RNA molecules. eukaryotic ribosomes contain four. polycomb proteins form two major PRC: PRC1 and PRC2. PRC1 components were first characterized in Drosophila [50]. homologs genes were identified in human: CBXs, PHC1, 2, and 3. lncRNAs that interact with miRNAs are classified as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) this definition was proposed by Salmena and colleagues in 2011 [65]. ceRNAs compete with mRNAs for miRNA binding. eRNAs can increase expression of target genes in cis and were first described in 2010 using RNA-seq and Chip-seq techniques. the mechanism of transcriptional enhancement can vary, some eRNAs increase the strength of the enhancer-promoter looping while others will impede the binding of negative elongation factors to the promoter to reduce transcriptional repression. some lncRNAs can be translated [36,81]. it is important to associate a mass spectrometry analysis (MS) to confirm the presence of translated peptides. among 233 lncRNAs associated with ribosomes in human cell lines, only 18 were confirmed to produce small peptides by MS [82]. trans-acting lncRNAs are transcribed in chromosome 12 and then transported by the Suz-Twelve protein to its target site, the homeobox D cluster on chromosome 2. lncRNAs can bind to transcription elongation factors or other proteins like the RNA polymerase and can have multiple targets throughout the genome. chromosomal RNA or cRNA can interact with chromatin in multiple ways. polycomb proteins form two major PRC: PRC1 and PRC2. chromosomal RNAs can interact with chromatin in multiple ways. miRNA Sponges LncRNAs can interact with miRNAs to act as post-transcriptional regulators of protein expression. ceRNAs are also known as miRNA sponges and compete with mRNAs for miRNA binding. the protein-coding gene Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog is regulated by miR-19b and -20a which can be sequestered by the pseudogene PTENP1 affecting the level of its cognate gene. circular RNAs (circRNAs) form a covalently continuous loop characterized by the end terminal joining having on their sequence multiple binding sites for a specific miRNA. eRNAs are short DNA regions (50\u20131500 bp SINEUPs are modular antisense lncRNAs that have two sequence specificities. they contain an inverted SINEB2 sequence and a small complementarity sequence with the targeted mRNA. SINEUPs can up-regulate the translation of mRNAs in a gene-specific manner without affecting gene expression. chromatin interacting lncRNAs act by targeting the chromatin region from which they are transcribed. the targeted lncRNA is not necessarily restricted to the close proximity of the lncRNA, for example, the well-known lncRNA XIST acts by targeting the whole X chromosome in cis. lncRNAs contain specific sequences to indicate that they have to be retained in the nucleus [90,91] most of the nuclear lncRNAs are regulators of transcription or influence mRNA processing. they can enhance or silence the transcription of genes by recruiting transcription factors or by acting as decoy impeding the binding of transcription factors to DNA. phenylalanine (F) and glycine (G) repeat proteins in nuclear pore. lncRNAs are more commonly involved in post-transcriptional regulation. competing endogenous RNAs can act as alternative targets for miRNAs to reduce the amount of RNA interference. heavy strand is reach in genes while light codes only for one subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ND), 8 tRNAs, and 3 lncRNAs. lncRNAs regulate ND5 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5), ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6), and CYTB. RNAseq proposes a regulatory action by matching to the 5\u2032-UTR, 3\u2032-UTR, or coding regions of specific targets. most of the nuclear lncRNAs are regulators of transcription or influence mRNA processing. lncRNAs that are only found in the nucleus are classified as nuclear lncRNAs. the nucleus to the cytoplasm involves several different proteins localized on both sides of the nuclear pore. the nuclear export receptor is remodeled to remove certain nuclear associated exported factors, recycled back into the nucleus, and to make the mRNA or the lncRNA stably located in the cytoplasm. organelles for energy production (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts) present their own genome that during the evolution has lost most of the genes leaving to the nuclear genome the task of synthesizing for most of the proteins for organelles functions. mitochondrial genome maintains the capacity of synthesizing for 13 proteins (required for part of OxPhos complexes) the genome of chloroplasts, such as mitochondrial one, synthesizes for lncRNAs. other lncRNAs were synthesized by the nuclear genome. the genome of chloroplasts, such as mitochondrial one, synthesizes for lncRNAs. different technologies can be used for enrichment, such as microfiltration, density gradient centrifugation, immunoaffinity, and magnetic-activated cell sorting. reducing processing time with minimal manipulation of samples is still a challenge to overcome. micropipette isolation method consists of diluting the cells to a very low concentration and seeding them into a tube [113,114] or 96 well plate [115] the dielectrophoresis system uses electrokinetic properties of cells to move them on a chip. each bead contains several primers composed by PCR handles, cell barcodes, and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) sequences. an oligod(T) sequence is present at the end of all primers for capturing polyadenylated RNAs and priming reverse transcription. punching technology consists of filling samples into chips or arrays, collecting individual cells into microwells, select cells of interest and then \u201cpunch\u201d them into PCR tubes or plates. the first one can process up to 50 mL samples and is optimized for the isolation of rare cells in large volumes. the second one is designed to collect both the magnetic microwell and the single cell attached to it by using a magnetic wand. synthesis, the bead can also contain unique molecular identifiers (UMI) sequences, specific to each molecule. some platforms do not contain reagents for reverse transcription inside the droplets. other instruments (e.g., Chromium System\u201410 Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; InDrop System\u20141CellBio, Watertown, MA, USA; C1 System\u2014Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA; ddSEQ Single micropipette Isolation LCM FACS Capillary Based Punching Technology DEP High-Throughput Droplet-Based Low-Throughput Droplet-Based Main Platforms N/A Several Platforms AVISO CellCelector CellRaft AIR DEPArray NxT Chromium System C1 System Nadia Puncher Platform InDrop System ddSEQ Single-Cell Isolator Throughput Low Low (100 cells) Low (100 cells) Low (100 the number of cells that can be analyzed with single-cell approaches is comprised between 100 and 10,000 cells. it is estimated that only 10\u201320% of transcripts are converted into cDNA with the available protocols. oligo-dT primers can be used to initiate the cDNA reaction, but they will only anneal on polyadenylated RNAs, such as mRNAs. scRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis final steps of single-cell RNA (scRNA) analysis are the sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. alternative methods focusing on the sequencing of 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of transcripts were developed. scRNA-seq can be performed on full-length RNA or just on its 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends with the consequent necessity of performing the sequencing at a different depth. full-length transcript libraries are sequenced at the depth of 106 reads per cell with the possibility to increase the sequencing depth (15\u201325 106 reads per cell) laser capture microdissection (LCM) consists of coupling a laser system (infrared or ultraviolet) to a microscope that can capture a single cell from a solid tissue [116,117] the advantages of LCM include visual inspection and spatial information of cells on the tissue and the possibility to store the remaining tissue. an oligod(T) sequence is present at the end of all primers for capturing polyadenylated RNAs and priming reverse transcription. the fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) has higher efficiency than the previous methods and the principle of this technique is based on tagging cells with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody specific to surface antigens. negative selection can be carried out on unmarked cells. dielectrophoresis (DEP) technique is performed using the DEPArray NxT instrument. it explores the electrokinetic properties of suspended cells to create \u201celectric cages\u201d and capture them with a non-uniform electric field. the low voltage applied does not interfere with cell viability. ddSEQ Single-Cell Isolator can perform the reactions inside the droplet. these platforms enable the analysis of up to 10,000 single cells in a parallel manner, avoiding cross-contamination and increasing reproducibility. the current trend is to use instruments that provide end-to-end solutions such as the C1 System and the Chromium System. the number of cells that can be analyzed with single-cell approaches is comprised between 100 and 10,000 cells. the number of cells that can be analyzed with single-cell approaches is comprised between 100\u201320% of transcripts are converted into cDNA with the available protocols. template switching and in vitro transcription are two main strategies to run the cDNA amplification. a modified oligo(dT) primer is used to prime first-strand synthesis. reverse transcriptase adds a short deoxycytidine tail at the 3\u2032 end of the first-strand cDNA. scRNA-seq can be performed on full-length RNA or just on its 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends with the consequent necessity of performing the sequencing at a different depth. scRNA-seq can be performed on full-length RNA or just on its 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends with the consequent necessity of performing the sequencing at a different depth. lncRNAs have been identified by scRNA-seq. this could be due to their lower expression in respect to coding genes. it has become clear how localization, tissue, and cell specificity are key factors. X and one Y chromosome always generated equal numbers of XIST and Sry amplicons since the Sry gene is on the Y chromosome. in 2007 they developed a new method to quantify different genes whose expression is not functionally guided by sex. they demonstrated both XIST and Oct4 were expressed to variable degrees in the cells of the same embryo. lncRNAs in Embryo-Derived Cells XIST is one of the best known lncRNAs [93] to better understand the process of X chromosome inactivation, the expression of XIST was analyzed in single cells of human embryos through the oocyte-to-embryo transition and in new mRNA reprogrammed iPSCs by [157]. scRNA-seq quickly became one of the most common techniques for single-cell studies in both human and mouse. they generated a transcriptional database analyzing 1529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos. they used a large number of embryos to dilute out embryo-specific differences that might be caused by embryo-specific factors. the authors showed that applying this algorithm to analyze murine embryonic stem cells they were able to identify four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) two different techniques were developed for the analysis of total RNA from single cells. the authors identified 75 putative lncRNAs in human samples. only 18 appeared conserved among human and mouse supporting data. the long non-coding RNA H19 is one of the most studied lncRNAs. pre-HSCs showed increased DNA methylation on promoters associated with the downregulation of several transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis. in 2015, the authors described the dynamic expression of 437 lncRNAs during the reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotent cells. they showed that some lncRNAs are functionally relevant for reprogramming. RNAseq on manually selected neuronal cells was used to analyze the expression of single cells purified from the human brain. among 935 identified lncRNAs, 113 were differentially expressed throughout the cell types and associated the expression of lncRNAs with marker-based cell types. the same lncRNA could have different roles in different cells. this last result suggests that the same lncRNA could have different roles in different cells. we functionally discussed the involvement of the lncRNA Pvt1 in the modulation of muscle atrophy. the authors inferred the function of lncRNAs by correlating their expression with that of coding RNAs. they demonstrated that lncRNAs were involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis and related cellular functions. they also associated an aberrant expression of lncRNAs with myelodysplastic syndromes. lncRNAs in Embryo-Derived Cells XIST is one of the best known lncRNAs. the expression of XIST is initially expressed in newly reprogrammed iPSCs. the development of scRNA-seq techniques allowed for more broad studies firstly of coding and then of non-coding RNAs. scRNA-seq quickly became one of the most common techniques for single-cell studies in both human and mouse. they used a large number of embryos in order to dilute out embryo-specific differences that might be caused by embryo-specific factors. in humans, the X chromosome inactivation may be compatible with a partial and complementary inactivation of both X chromosomes in females. amplification or activity of deoxynucleotidyl transferase to create an anchor in the 3\u2032 end of cDNA [161], random displacement amplification sequencing (RamDA-seq) and multiple annealing and dC-tailing-based quantitative single-cell RNA-seq (MATQ-seq) show higher sensitivity to non-polyadenylated RNA and near-complete full-length transcript coverage without no authors identified 75 putative lncRNAs in human samples, but only 18 appeared conserved among human and mouse supporting data that describe lncRNAs as non-conserved transcripts. the long non-coding RNA H19 is one of the most studied lncRNAs. lncRNAs in Differentiated Cells Rather than using pluripotent cells, several studies have instead focused on specialized/differentiated cells. in 2015, the authors described the dynamic expression of 437 lncRNAs during the reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotent cells. RNAseq on manually selected neuronal cells was used by Spaethling and colleagues to analyze the expression of single cells purified from the human brain. among 935 identified lncRNAs, 113 were differentially expressed throughout the cell types and associated the expression of lncRNAs with marker-based cell types. qRT-PCR and RNA-FISH were used on both myoblasts and myofibers. we discussed the involvement of the lncRNA Pvt1 in the modulation of muscle atrophy and mitochondrial network. the authors inferred the function of lncRNAs by correlating their expression with that of coding RNAs. lncRNAs involved in regulation of hematopoiesis and related cellular functions. lncRNAs associated aberrant expression of lncRNAs with myelodysplastic syndromes. path contains transcription factors and lncRNAs supporting one more time their importance in cancer development. single-cell genome-wide microarray and sequencing experiments are not easy to use and need bioinformatics skills. the EMBL database contains 52 experiments for cells from H. sapiens, 51 for M. musculus, 7 for D. rerio, 1 for R. norvegicus, 1 for S. mansoni, 1 for A. gambiae, 1 for A. melanogaster, and 1 for C. elegans. databases have the possibility to interrogate them with a specific gene. this last restriction may be a limitation for the database usage. studying a gene or a group of genes in specific tissues may be important to formulate new experimental hypothesis. lncRNAs the MOuse NOnCode Lung database (MONOCL) includes information on mice infected with influenza virus and coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. lncRNAs impact on patient prognosis [198] and influence pathological conditions [114] for these reasons, it is important to catalog lncRNAs linking their involvement with cancer. EMBL-EBI developed a single-cell expression atlas [178] containing 52 experiments for cells from H. sapiens, 51 for M. musculus, 7 for D. rerio, 1 for R. norvegicus, 1 for S. mansoni, 1 for A. gambiae, 1 for S. melanogaster, and 1 for C. elegans. the RIKEN database contains experiments performed on H. sapiens and database name Organisms Reference PanglaoDB Mouse, human [182] Single-cell database Mouse [183] JingleBells Different organisms (Mouse, human, zebrafish, brown rat, brown rat) lncRNAs impact on patient prognosis [198] and influence pathological conditions [114] it is important to catalog lncRNAs linking their involvement with cancer. other databases that consider lncRNAs in association with cancer are the LncRNADisease database [200] a step forward in the safety of cell reprogramming was done using miRNAs [210]. the analysis of lncRNAs requires a deeper mechanistic exploration of their cellular expression. this result is related to the cell-specific expression of ncRNAs not detectable analyzing RNA expression using whole tissues or a heterogeneous cell population. the first hypothesis is based on the possible existence of multiple equi-phenotypic molecular states (different combinations of gene expression may lead to the same phenotype) the second hypothesis is based on the evolutionary concept: Having cell-to-cell variability allows a better response to environmental changes. the method was used by Faridani and colleagues [132] and allowed them to identify about 3800 miRNAs from HEK293, nave embryonic stem cells, and primed embryonic stem cells. we confirmed the expression of miRNAs detected with single-cell sequencing by using qRT-PCR showing an average correlation of almost 0.8. human biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is a project to develop a workflow for mapping the human body at single-cell resolution. it will be useful to formulate new biomedical hypotheses, to identify new biomarkers for disease diagnosis, to stage disease progression and to predict optimal treatment regimens."}
