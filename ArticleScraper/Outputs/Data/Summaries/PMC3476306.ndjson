{"summary": "the innate immune system launches an immediate defense program that is characterized by the rapid induction of antiviral cytokines/chemokines. these soluble factors act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. these soluble factors act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) IKK directly phosphorylate serine residues in the C-terminal region of a latent transcription factor, IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) resulting in IRF3 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of promoters for IFN- and a subset of ISGs. defining the mechanisms of innate immune signaling will provide useful clues that inform novel approaches to antiviral therapy. TRIM25 catalyzes ubiquitination of the caspase recruitment domain of RIG-I. TRIM25 culminates in IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN induction (25). TRIM56 is an IFN- and virus-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase which acts to restrict replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus. pCX4bsr-FlagACE2 were constructed by inserting a cDNA fragment encoding flag-tagged human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) into the pCX4pur vector. cells HeLa, human embryo kidney (HEK) 293, 293-TLR3 (HEK293 cells stably expressing Flag-tagged human TLR3) were cultured. the resultant cell line was designated as HeLa-FitA2, which retained all features of HeLa Flp-IN T-Rex cells (including the intact innate immune signaling pathways) we then co-transfected HeLa-FitA2 cells with pOG44 (encoding the Flp recombinase) and pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-TRIM56 (or HA-mutant TRIM56) at a ratio of 9:1 poly-dA:dT was administered to cells by transfection at 4 g/35-mm dish after being complexed with Lipofectamine at 1:1 (g:l) ratio. IFN-(con) was used at a final concentration of 100 units/ml for cell stimulation. bound DNA probes were detected using anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase-conjugate (Roche), followed by reaction with CSPD and exposure to x-ray films. ethidium bromide-stained 18S and 28S rRNAs were programmed for synthesis of cDNA by MMLV reverse transcriptase. lysates were prepared by lysing cells in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100. cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were isolated using a nuclear extract kit from Active Motif. pFlag-TRIF-mRHIM contained a cDNA insert encoding a flag-tagged, constitutively active form of human TRIF. when overexpressed, flag-TRIFSA strongly activates IRF3 but it no longer induces apoptosis as does WT TRIF (28). pCX4pur-FlagACE2 were constructed by inserting a cDNA fragment encoding a flag-tagged form of human TRI HeLa Flp-IN T-Rex cells (30) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4 g/ml of blasicidin and 50 g/ml of Zeocin. the resultant cell line was designated as HeLa-FitA2, which retained all features of HeLa Flp-IN T-Rex cells. pOG44 (encoding the Flp recombinase) and pcDNA5/FRT/TO- luciferase-encoding vesicular stomatitis virus was propagated in Huh7.5 cells. poly-I:C (a dsRNA surrogate) and poly-dA:dT (a dsDNA surrogate) were obtained from Sigma. the siRNAs were transfected into cells at a final concentration of 100 nm using Lipofectamine 2000.

HeLa Flp-IN T-Rex cells were stably transduced with a replication incompetent retrovirus encoding human ACE2 (packaged from pCX4pur-FlagACE2) followed by selection with puromycin. the resultant cell line was designated as HeLa-FitA2, which retained all features of HeLa Flp-IN T-Rex cells (including the intact innate immune signaling pathways) poly-I:C (a dsRNA surrogate) and poly-dA:dT (a dsDNA surrogate) were obtained from Sigma. for stimulation of cells, poly-I:C was added directly into culture medium (pIC) at a final concentration of 50 g/ml. RNA Analyses Total RNA was isolated from cells following indicated treatments using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) equal amount of RNA samples (15 g) were fractionated on 1% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ Nylon membranes and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes specific for human ISG56. ISG56, 5\u2032-ccacaaaaaatcacaagccattt-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-cagggcaaggagaaccttaatatatc-3\u2032 (reverse); TLR3, 5\u2032-gcccttgggatgtgtgt-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-acttcagtgtca-3\u2032 (reverse); and IP-10, 5\u2032-tgaaaaaagaagg anti-IRF3, anti-IRF1 and anti-tubulin pAbs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SeV pAb (a gift from Ilkka Julkunen), anti-Flag M2 mAb (Sigma), anti-actin mAb (Sigma); and peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse pAbs (Southern Biotech) tet-inducible expression of TRIM56 on activation of IFN response via different signaling pathways. cells with tet-regulated conditional expression of WT HA-TRIM56 repress (tet) or induce (+tet) HA-TRIM56 expression followed by stimulation by extracellular poly-I:C (pIC, panel A), transfected poly-dA:dT. anti-TRIM56 antibody detected only endogenous TRIM56 protein in cells cultured in the absence of tet (lanes 2 and 4), which migrated slightly faster than the HA-TRIM56 detected in induced cells. expression of HA-TRIM56 substantially augmented the induction of ISG56 by extracellular administered poly-I:C, which activates the TLR3 signaling pathway. qPCR analysis showed that induction of ISG56 and RANTES mRNAs by intracellular dsRNA was significantly enhanced in the presence of HA-TRIM56. the potentiation of TLR3-mediated responses did not result from increased TLR3 expression upon HA-TRIM56 induction. TRIM56 regulates the TLR3 signaling pathway. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to potentiate TLR3-mediated IFN induction. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to promote TLR3 signaling. the lower expression level of this mutant revealed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody likely reflects the different folding of this mutant from WT. the exogenous introduced HA-TRIM56 (WT or mutants) could be detected in +tet cells by either anti-TRIM56 or anti-HA tag antibodies. cells conditional expressing WT TRIM56 to repress (tet) or induce (+tet) TRIM56 (or mutant TRIM56) expression compared responses to poly-I:C stimulation. results were in agreement with those obtained from transiently transfected 293-TLR3 cells. regulate ISG15 or ISG56 in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells. this was not attributed to defective Jak-Stat signaling downstream of the IFN receptor. induction of either ISG by IFN- was normal in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells compared with control HeLa cells. western blotting was carried out to determine the expression levels of ISG56 protein. ethidium bromide-stained 18S and 28S rRNAs served as loading controls. western blotting was carried out to determine the expression levels of ISG56 protein. transient knockdown of TRIM56 in 293-TLR3 cells stably overexpressing Flag-TLR3 significantly curtailed poly-I:C-induction of ISG56 protein and mRNAs. qPCR analysis showed poly-I:C-induced expression of ISG56, RANTES and OASL mRNAs was profoundly reduced in TRIM56 siRNA-transfected cells. TRIM56 impairs induction of type I IFN response by poly-I:C in HEK293-TLR3 cells. cells were then harvested for immunoblotting of ISG56, TRIM56, TLR3 (using anti-Flag antibody) and actin (panel A) TRIM56 depletion was responsible for the defective response to extracellular dsRNA in HeLa cells with stable knockdown of TRIM56. we generated TRIM56 shRNA (which was used to create HeLa T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells)-insensitive TRIM56-encoding vectors by introducing eight silent mutations in the shRNA targeting sequence (supplemental Fig. S3A) recombinant VSV encoding luciferase (VSV-Luc) replicated with similar efficiency as determined by the VSV-encoded luciferase activity. stability by poly-I:C produced an antiviral state in control HeLa cells. but poly-I:C was substantially less effective in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells, inhibiting viral replication by only 37 and 28%. hepatoma cells were reconstituted with TLR3 expression. infection by hepatitis C virus activates chemokine transcription upon TLR3 sensing of dsRNAs produced during HCV replication. this HCV infection model is spared from any confounding effect from RIG-I signaling. RANTES, IP-10, and TRIM56 mRNAs and HCV RNA levels by qPCR. denotes p = 0.06 between cells transfected with control siRNA and TRIM56 siRNA-2. TRIM56 knockdown severely impaired dsRNA-induced up-regulation of numerous ISGs that are transcriptionally regulated by IRF3. whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated IRF3. control HeLa and HeLa T56i-7 cells were stimulated by poly-I:C for the indicated time periods. TRIM56 interacts with TRIF. co-IP experiment in HEK293 cells co-expressing HA-TRIM56. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA. bottom blot showed expression of various Flag-tagged proteins. TRIM56 formed a complex with TRIF (Fig. 8B, lane 3), but not with TLR3, TRAF3 (lane 2 and 4 respectively) or IRF3 (data not shown), in co-transfected cells. TRIM56 also did not interact with ACE2, a negative control (lane 5). the RING mutant still associated with TRIF. HA-TRIM56 migrated slightly more slowly than endogenous TRIM56 (lane 2). turning on HA-TRIM56 expression in the absence of other stimuli did not induce a detectable IFN response. this is consistent with our previous observation (26) and suggests that TRIM56 expression per se does not activate IFN signaling. the blot at the bottom was detected by a mixture of anti-SeV and anti-actin antibodies. the antibody mainly reacted with two viral proteins, i.e. hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and nucleocapsid, with the latter having a molecular mass similar to actin. HA-TRIM56 also boosted the ISG induction in response to transfected dsDNA. however, HA-TRIM56 slightly decreased SeV-induced ISG protein expression. TRIM56 expression had no appreciable impact on ISG protein induction by intracellular dsRNA. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to potentiate TLR3-mediated IFN induction. the deletion mutant lacking the entire RING domain (mutant A) was as effective as the WT protein. expression of mutant TRIM56 proteins in cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-HA or anti-TRIM56 antibody. the lower expression level of this mutant revealed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody likely reflects the different folding of this mutant from WT and other mutant forms of TRIM56. mutants were tightly regulated by tetracycline and could be detected in de-repressed (+tet) cells by either anti-TRIM56 antibody or an antibody against the HA tag introduced to the N terminus. TRIM56 knockdown cells were then compared with control HeLa cells for their ability to mount IFN responses. poly-I:C also moderately up-regulated TRIM56 protein abundance. poly-I:C failed to up-regulate ISG15 or ISG56 in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells. this was not attributed to defective Jak-Stat signaling downstream of the IFN receptor. control HeLa, HeLa T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells were mock-treated, stimulated with poly-I:C, infected with SeV, or transfected with poly-dA:dT for 12 h. northern blotting was performed to quantify the expression levels of ISG56 protein. western blotting was carried out to determine the expression levels of ISG56 protein. knockdown of TRIM56 in 293-TLR3 cells stably overexpressing Flag-TLR3 significantly reduced expression of TRIM56 protein and mRNA prior to and after poly-I:C stimulation. knockdown of TRIM56 in 293-TLR3 cells stably overexpressing Flag-TLR3 was not affected. cells substantially curtailed poly-I:C-induction of ISG56 protein (Fig. 4A), IFN- promoter and transcript for IFN-, ISG56, OASL, and RANTES. a 50\u201370% reduction in poly-I:C responsiveness was observed in cells transfected with TRIM56 siRNA compared with cells receiving control siRNA. 0.050.06 between cells transfected with control siRNA and TRIM56 siRNA-2. TRIM56 depletion was responsible for the defective response to extracellular dsRNA in HeLa cells with stable knockdown of TRIM56. control HeLa cells, T56i-7, and T56i-12 cells were either mock-stimulated or stimulated by poly-I:C, followed by infection with a recombinant VSV encoding luciferase (VSV-Luc) TRIM56 expression per se had no effect on VSV propagation (26). TRIM56 dampens chemokine induction via the TLR3 signaling pathway. hepatoma cells were lysed for quantification of RANTES, IP-10, and TRIM56 mRNAs and HCV RNAs by qPCR. Huh7.5-TLR3 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or TRIM56 siRNA#2. at 48 h postinfection, cells were mock-infected or infected by HCV. at 48 h postinfection, cells were lysed for total RNA isolation. TRIM56 decreases poly-I:C-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated IRF3. TRIM56 interacts with TRIF. effect of TRIM56 knockdown on activation of IFN- promoter by overexpression of downstream signaling molecules, IKK or the constitutively active IRF3\u20135D. these data imply that TRIM56 likely operates at the level of TRIF or above. TRIM56 (and the RING mutant) may promote TLR3 signaling by interacting with critical components in the pathway to facilitate signaling complex formation. TRIM56 formed a complex with TRIF (Fig. 8B, lane 3), but not with TLR3, TRAF3 (lane 2 and 4 respectively) or IRF3 (data not shown), in co-transfected cells. TRIM56 did not interact with ACE2, a negative control (lane 5). HeLa-FitA2-T56 cells were selected for this purpose because they possess intact TLR3 and RLR signaling pathways. when cultured in the absence of tetracycline, these cells expressed very low levels of endogenous TRIM56 protein. however, upon addition of tetracycline into culture medium, these cells showed robust expression of HA-TRIM56 (lane 1), which migrated slightly more slowly than endogenous TRIM56 (lane 2). cell lysates were harvested for immunoblot analysis of ISG56, ISG15, TRIM56, and actin expression. in panel B, a nonspecific band (marked by filled circle) detected by the anti-ISG15 antibody served as a loading control. expression of HA-TRIM56 substantially augmented the induction of ISG56 by extracellular administered poly-I:C. HA-TRIM56 also boosted the ISG induction in response to transfected dsDNA (poly-dA:dT) but HA-TRIM56 slightly decreased SeV-induced ISG protein expression. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to potentiate TLR3-mediated IFN induction by TRIM56. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to potentiate TLR3-mediated IFN induction. expression of WT/mutant TRIM56 proteins in cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-HA or anti-TRIM56 antibody. the lower expression level of this mutant revealed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody likely reflects the different folding of this mutant from WT. TRIM56 mutant cells were stably transfected with a shRNA construct targeting human TRIM56. the cells were stably transfected with a shRNA construct specifically targeting human TRIM56. the cells were stably transfected with a shRNA construct targeting human TRIM56. independent cell clones express TRIM56 protein at 20% of that expressed in control HeLa cells. extracellular poly-I:C-induced robust expression of ISG15 and ISG56 proteins. poly-I:C failed to up-regulate ISG15 or ISG56 in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells. control HeLa cells with stable knockdown of TRIM56 (T56i-7 and T56i-12) were mock-treated, stimulated with poly-I:C or IFN- for 12 h. cells were lysed for immunoblotting of ISG15, ISG56, TRIM56 and actin expression. we also found that TRIM56 silencing severely compromised the induction of ISG56 transcript and protein by transfected poly-dA:dT. we also found that TRIM56 silencing may impair dsRNA response by simply reducing TLR3 expression. knockdown of TRIM56 in 293-TLR3 cells substantially curtailed poly-I:C-induction of ISG56 protein (Fig. 4A), IFN- promoter (Fig. 4B) and transcript for IFN-, ISG56, OASL, and RANTES. a 50\u201370% reduction in poly-I:C responsiveness was observed in cells transfected with TRIM56 siRNA compared with cells receiving control siRNA. p = 0.050.06 between cells transfected with control siRNA and TRIM56 siRNA-2. poly-I:C (12 h)-induced IFN- promoter activation in HEK293-TLR3 cells transfected with control siRNA. TRIM56 promotes TLR3 signaling independent of its RING-domain. but instead relying on its C-terminal portion. TRIM56 silencing undermines TLR3-mediated antiviral response. control HeLa, HeLa T56i-7, and T56i-12 cells were mock-stimulated or stimulated by poly-I:C followed by infection with VSV-Luc. at 3 h postinfection, cells were lysed for quantification of RANTES, IP-10, and TRIM56 mRNAs and HCV RNAs by qPCR. knockdown of TRIM56 dampens TLR3-mediated chemokine induction by HCV infection in Huh7.5-TLR3 cells. 30 h later, cells were mock-infected or infected by HCV. TRIM56 is essential for TLR3-mediated Activation of IRF3 IRF3. poly-I:C-induced nuclear translocation of IRF3 was abrogated in control HeLa T56i-7 cells with stable TRIM56 depletion. TRIM56 contributes to TLR3-dependent antiviral responses by participating in critical signaling process(es leading to activation of IRF3. forced expression of a constitutively active TRIF (TRIFSA) was equally effective in upregulating ISG56 expression in control HeLa cells and cells with stable TRIM56 depletion. however, we did not observe any inhibitory effect of TRIM56 knockdown on activation of IFN- promoter by overexpression of the downstream signaling molecules, IKK or the constitutively active IRF3\u20135D. these data suggest that TRIM56 likely operates at the level of the bottom blot showed expression of the various HA-TRIM56 proteins (WT or mutant) in cell lysates. because the RING mutant retained the ability to enhance TLR3 signaling, the augmentation of TLR3 response by TRIM56 was not due to ubiquitination of signaling proteins. conditional expression of TRIM56 Enhances Induction of Type I Interferon Response through the TLR3 Pathway. cells with tet-regulated conditional expression of HA-tagged TRIM56 were selected for this purpose because they possess intact TLR3 and RLR signaling pathways. cell lysates were harvested for immunoblot analysis of ISG56, ISG15, TRIM56, and actin expression. cell lysates were harvested for immunoblot analysis of ISG56, ISG15, TRIM56, and actin expression. qPCR analysis of pIC- or pdAdT-induced IFN- promoter activity in HeLa-FitA2-T56 cells without (tet) or with (+tet) HA-TRIM56 expression substantially augmented the induction of ISG56 by extracellular administered poly-I:C. however, HA-TRIM56 slightly decreased SeV-induced ISG protein expression without affecting SeV replication. aa 621\u2013695 (M mutant) and aa 693\u2013750 (N mutant) were equally effective in nullifying the ability of TRIM56 to potentiate TLR3-mediated IFN induction. TRIM56 has intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that lies in the N-terminal RING domain (26) the RING domain controls the ability of TRIM56 to promote TLR3 signaling. the C-terminal portion, but not the RING domain, controls the ability of TRIM56 to promote TLR3 signaling. tet and +tet cells have a p value of 0.01. immunoblotting of IRF1, ISG56 and actin expression in HeLa-FitA2-derived cell lines conditionally expressing WT or the indicated TRIM56 mutant. in these cell lines expression of TRIM56 mutants was tightly regulated by tetracycline. knockdown of TRIM56 Impairs TLR3-mediated Induction of ISGs by dsRNA. two independent cell clones, i.e. T56i-7 and T56i-12, expressed TRIM56 protein at 20% of that expressed in control HeLa cells. poly-I:C also moderately up-regulated TRIM56 protein abundance. promoter by pIC was almost ablated in T56i-7 and T56i-12 cells. the defect in IFN/ISG induction by dsRNA occurred at promoter level. control HeLa and HeLa cells with stable knockdown of TRIM56 (T56i-7 and T56i-12) were mock-treated, stimulated with poly-I:C or IFN- for 12 h. poly-I:C moderately up-regulated TRIM56 expression in cells transfected with control siRNA. we also found that TRIM56 silencing severely compromised the induction of ISG56 transcript and protein by transfected poly-dA:dT. however, seV-induced ISG56 expression was not affected by TRIM56 knockdown. knockdown of TRIM56 in 293-TLR3 cells significantly curtailed poly-I:C-induction of ISG56 protein (Fig. 4A), IFN- promoter (Fig. 4B) and transcript for IFN-, ISG56, OASL, and RANTES (Fig. 4C). TRIM56 silencing may impair dsRNA response by simply reducing TLR3 expression. poly-I:C moderately up-regulated TRIM56 expression in cells transfected with control siRNA. in panel C, * and ** indicate statistical differences exist with a p value of 0.01 when compared with cells transfected with control siRNA and stimulated by poly-I:C. TRIM56 expression conferred HeLa T56i-7 cells the capacity to activate the IFN- promoter (supplemental Fig. S3B) and to upregulate ISG56 expression (supplemental Fig. S3C) after poly-I:C stimulation. TRIM56 promotes TLR3 signaling independent of its RING-domain but instead rely on its C-terminal portion. TRIM56 depletion compromises the establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand. control HeLa, HeLa T56i-7, and T56i-12 cells were mock-stimulated or stimulated by poly-I:C. at 3 h postinfection, cells were lysed for quantification of. RANTES, IP-10, and TRIM56 mRNAs and HCV RNAs significantly up-regulated expression in cells transfected with control siRNA. however, these responses were curtailed by 50\u201360% in TRIM56 knockdown cells. this was not a result of reduced expression of HCV PAMP. we investigated whether TRIM56 contributes to IRF3 activation downstream of TLR3. poly-I:C-induced nuclear translocation of IRF3 was abrogated in control cells with stable TRIM56 depletion. TRIM56 decreased poly-I:C-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. TRIM56 interacts with TRIF We next sought to characterize the mechanism by which TRIM56 regulates TLR3-mediated IRF3 activation. forced expression of a constitutively active TRIF (TRIFSA) was equally effective in upregulating ISG56 expression in control HeLa cells and cells with stable TRIM56 depletion. co-IP experiment in HEK293 cells co-expressing Flag- TRIFSA and WT HA-TRIM56 or various mutant HA-TRIM56. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag, followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA or anti-Flag-HRP. the bottom blot showed expression of the various HA-TRIM56 proteins in cell lysates. terminal portion of TRIM56 is critical for its interaction with TRIF. ability to associate with TRIF correlates with capacity of TRIM56 to promote TLR3 signaling. TRIM56 depletion greatly compromised establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand. TRIM56 knockdown cells demonstrate that TRIM56 does not regulate signaling events via the Jak-STAT pathway downstream of the IFN receptor. previously, we reported that overexpression of TRIM56 restricted the replication of BVDV in permissive MDBK cells in a way that was not a result of general augmentation of the IFN response. we found that TRIM56 was essential for the IFN response activated via the TLR3 pathway but not required for ISG expresson induced via the RLRs. TRIM56 specifically formed a complex with TRIF, the TLR3 adaptor, but not with downstream signaling components, TRAF3 and IRF3. gene knock-out studies have demonstrated that STING is dispensable for TLR3 signaling. TRIM56 acted at a level at or above TRIF (Fig. 8A) suggesting the biological relevance of this interaction for the participation of TRIM56 in TLR3-mediated antiviral responses. TRIM56 acted at a level at or above TRIF (Fig. 8A), suggesting the role of TRIM56 in RLR signaling is much less certain. tet-regulated expression of TRIM56 reduced ISG56 and ISG15 protein levels following SeV infection. future studies in TRIM56 knock-out mice will be required to clarify the role that TRIM56 may play in RLR signaling."}
