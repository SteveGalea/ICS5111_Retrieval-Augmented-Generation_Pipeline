{"summary": "aptamers are short, single-stranded oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) that bind to targets with high affinity and specificity by folding into tertiary structures. aptamers have promising role in clinical diagnostics and as therapeutic agents. comparison of critical features of aptamers shows how aptamers can supplement monoclonal antibodies. Aptamers Antibodies Stability Withstand repeated rounds of denaturation/renaturation. Temperature resistant: stable at room temperature. Long shelf life (several years). Can be lyophilized. cell-SELEX, capillary electrophoresis-SELEX (CE-SELEX), atomic force microscopy-SELEX (AFM-SELEX), and artificially expanded genetic information system-SELEX are herein reviewed. key aspects, advantages, and disadvantages of each SELEX method are highlighted in Table 2. Method Key Aspects Advantages Disadvantages IP-SELEX Includes immunoprecipitation.
