{"summary": "RNA viruses struggle with host defense mechanisms, diverse cellular environments in different tissues, anatomic restrictions such as the blood-brain barrier, and host-to-host transmission. genetic diversity in RNA virus populations appears to be critical for fitness and survival and likely contributes to pathogenesis. the most extensively characterized lethal mutagen is ribavirin, a drug currently included in the standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (6, 8\u201310). a complication arises from the fact that lethal mutagens can have pleiotropic effects on cells, not the least of which is utilization of the compounds by cellular polymerases. H273R was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. reduced virulence was attributable to the inability of H273R to sustain replication in tissues/organs that are normally infected by PV. the clone was produced by overlap-extension PCR with oligonucleotides 3D-PV-AvrII-rev (5\u2032-CCT GAG TGT TCC TAG T-3\u2032), 3D-PV-H273R-for (5\u2032-CTA AAC CAC TCA CAC AGG CTG TAC AAG AAT AAA ACA-3\u2032), and 3D-PV-PstI-for (5\u2032-CCT RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase.

Virus from the supernatants of infected cells was harvested by three freeze-thaw cycles and used to re-infect fresh HeLa cell monolayers. at each passage, viral RNA was extracted for quantitation using RT-PCR. RT-PCR experiments amplified polymerase-coding region. the titer of P2 virus stock was assumed to be the same as the P1 virus stock for each virus-m.o.i. pair. the titer was then used to calculate the amount of virus required to achieve m.o.i. of 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 for subsequent passage infections. mice transgenic for the PV receptor (cPVR) were infected with PV at the indicated titer (pfu) by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection in 3 ml of serum-free media or intramuscular (i.m.) or intracranial injection. mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. antibody Neutralization Assay Serum from immunized mice was collected and pooled according to immunized dose at day 25 post-inoculation. diluted, mixed with 50 pfu WT PV, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h and then added to HeLa cell monolayers. virus solution was dialyzed overnight using a 50\u2013100-kDa cutoff membrane against 1 liter of TN buffer at 4 \u00b0C. after dialysis, virus solution was subjected to the second purification step through a 30% sucrose cushion. the final pellet was resuspended in 100 l of TN buffer. cells and Viruses HeLa S3 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. the mutation was introduced into a modified 3Dpol-coding sequence by overlap-extension PCR. the final product of the second PCR was purified and digested with PstI and NheI. p Proteins WT, G64S, and H273R RdRp derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli by using a ubiquitin fusion system as described previously (18) and then purified as described previously (1). RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [-32P]ATP, 100 m RNA oligonucleotide, 1 Kinase Buffer, and 0.4 units/l T4 reactions were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 m ZnCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2. reactions were assembled by incubating 1 m PV RdRp with 1 m sym/sub RNA primer-template for 3 min, allowing equilibration to 30 \u00b0C. PCR products were purified and digested with AvrII and AflII. the digested PCR product was ligated into pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD vector. the fragment between the BglII and EcoRI sites was cloned into the viral cDNA plasmid. pMovRA and pRLucRA plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and ApaI. RNA was then transcribed from the linearized plasmid DNAs in a 20-l reaction mixture. the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. the RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. the RNA quality was verified by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. cells were transfected with 5 g of viral RNA transcript. agarose overlay was removed, and cells were stained with crystal violet. cells were infected with virus at a m.o.i. of 10. cDNA was isolated with QIAamp viral RNA purification kit. gent was separated on a 1% native agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by passive capillary blotting. hybridization was performed using PCR-based probes to the three-dimensional region of the PV genome essentially as described previously (22). viral supernatant was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a solution of 20% PEG-8000 and 1 m NaCl. pellet was carefully washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, and then suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl (1 ml per 10 ml of viral supernatant). guanidine resistance assay HeLa cells were infected with 106 pfu of either WT or H273R PV in the presence of 3 mm guanidine hydrochloride. plates were incubated for 3\u20134 days at 37 \u00b0C before being stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted to determine guanidine resistant frequency (guar/106 pfu) Virus Competition Experiment HeLa cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 with a virus mixture composed of WT and H273R PV at a ratio of 1:9. after adsorption, input virus was removed, and infection was allowed to proceed to cell lysis. the titer of P2 virus stock was assumed to be the same as the P1 virus stock for each virus-m.o.i. pair. after all eight passages were completed, viruses were collected after each passage was titered. mice transgenic for the PV receptor (cPVR) were infected with PV at the indicated titer (pfu) by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection in 3 ml of serum-free media or intramuscular (i.m.) or intracranial injection. mice were challenged 1 month after initial infection using the same methods with 5PD50 of WT PV (1 108 pfu) by i.p. injection. five mice were infected intravenously with 108 or 109 pfu of WT or H273R PV. tissue was removed, washed, weighed, and homogenized in 2 ml of PBS. tissue homogenates were then titered for virus on HeLa cells. pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of TN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl) pellet was centrifuged in a bucket rotor at 190,000 g for 14 h. virus solution was dialyzed overnight using a 50\u2013100-kDa cutoff membrane. the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Pennsylvania State University. all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. cells and Viruses HeLa S3 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. expression and Purification of PV RdRp Proteins WT, G64S, and H273R RdRp derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli. RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. reactions were heated to 90 \u00b0C for 1 min and slowly cooled (5 \u00b0C/min) to 10 \u00b0C. reactions were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 m ZnCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2. rapid mixing/quenching experiments were performed by using a model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus. 273R mutation into the 3Dpol-coding sequence of viral cDNA, pMovRA. PCR was performed with oligonucleotides PV-3D-AvrII-rev, PV-3D-AflII-for (5\u2032-AAC GAT CCC AGG CTT AAG ACA GAT GAG-3\u2032) and the pET26Ub-3D-BPKN-I92T-Arg-273 plasmid pMovRA and pRLucRA plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and ApaI. RNA was then transcribed from the linearized plasmid DNAs in a 20-l reaction mixture. pMovRA and pRLucRA plasmids were purified with Qiaex II suspension. oside triphosphates, 0.025 g/l linearized DNA, and 0.025 g/l T7 RNA polymerase were incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C, and magnesium pyrophosphate was removed by centrifugation for 2 min. virus was serially diluted in PBS and placed on cells in 6-well plates to allow the virus to adsorb to the cells. after 2\u20134 days of incubation, the agarose overlay was removed and cells were stained with crystal violet. oligonucleotide 3D-PV-PstI-for (5\u2032-GGA GTG ATA ACA GGT TCT GGG TGC GAT-3\u2032) RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent. hybridization was performed using PCR-based probes to the three-dimensional region of the PV genome essentially as described previously (22). two PCR products were obtained for each viral isolate. a product spanning the 5\u2032-UTR and capsid coding region was obtained. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, suspended in RNase-free water. cells were infected with 106 pfu of either WT or H273R PV in the presence of 3 mm guanidine hydrochloride. cells were incubated for 3\u20134 days at 37 \u00b0C before being stained with crystal violet. the percentage of plaques was plotted as a function of ribavirin concentration and fit to a sigmoidal dose-response Equation 3. y is the % of plaques relative to untreated cells; A is the minimum % of plaques; and H is the Hill slope. serial/Blind Passage HeLa cells were infected with P0 virus at m.o.i. of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 and allowed to proceed for 8 h. then viruses were harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles and titered (P1) the titer of P2 virus stock was assumed to be the same as the P1 virus stock for each virus-m.o.i. pair. qPCR was done by adding 10 or 20 ng of cDNA in a reaction with 2 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA) in a volume of 20 l. a standard curve was generated using in vitro transcribed RNA. mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. PD50 values were determined by the Reed and Muench method. mice were challenged 1 month after initial infection using 5PD50 of WT PV. each day, five mice from each group were sacrificed, and tissues were removed, washed, weighed, and homogenized. precipitated virus was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of TN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl) the pellet was then overlaid onto a 1.5-ml sucrose cushion. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (La Jolla, CA) the S.E. and S.D. values are indicated where appropriate. survival curve comparisons were performed using the product limit method. the reduced fidelity of nucleotide addition by H273R RdRp was further supported by the appearance of products greater than n + 1 when ATP and RTP were used as substrates. these data suggest that H273R RdRp is a mutator polymerase. values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies (1, 20) a, values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies (1, 10, 20). a, values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies (1, 10, 20). four consecutive passages of H273R at low multiplicities of infection showed no evidence of genetic changes in polymerase-coding sequence. however, using a more sensitive assay, a subgenomic replicon, we observed a subtle delay in H273R replication with respect to WT. by 6 h the mutant reached WT levels of replication. cells were infected with either WT or H273R PV. a 50% increase in mutations was observed in H273R, averaging 3.0 mutations per genome. the observed mutation frequencies from sequencing reflect averages at multiple locations within a specific genomic region (VP1). the phenotypic assay (guar) provides the frequency of a specific transition mutation in the genome. arginine substitution at position 273 of the PV RdRp significantly increases the virus mutation rate. the percentage of surviving virus for WT, G64S, and H273R PV after infecting HeLa cells at either low (m.o.i. of 0.01, C) or high (m.o.i. of 5, D) m.o.i. in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin. the titer (pfu/ml) after infection at low m.o.i. for WT, G64S, and H27 p, G64S, exhibits reduced sensitivity to ribavirin in cell culture (1\u20134). we predicted low fidelity variants of the PV RdRp would exhibit enhanced sensitivity to ribavirin. ribavirin was more pronounced at low multiplicities of infection. fragmented RNA is circularized and the circularized template was copied reiteratively in a process of rolling-circle reverse transcription. multiple copies of a single sequence permits error correction sufficient to call mutations present at a frequency lower than 106 (23, 24). the most striking finding was that the fold-change in mutation frequency observed for H273R PV relative to WT PV could be separated into two categories (Table 1). shown is the percentage of WT and H273R PV remaining after 1\u20134 serial passages. the initial virus mixture contained a ratio of WT/H273R, 1:9. dilution drives H273R PV to extinction before WT and G64S. the titer of virus (pfu/ml) produced during P2 for each virus/m.o.i. pair was assumed to be constant (i.e. dose-response ratio), and this titer was used to calculate the amount of the virus required to achieve m.o.i. of 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 for subsequent passage infections. we compared the fecundity of H273R with that of WT and G64S PV at a low m.o.i. over eight generations. the fecundity of WT increased during passage, whereas that of G64S PV was unchanged and that of H273R substantially decreased. TEM images are shown of WT (A), H273R (B), and G64S PV (C). Empty particles constitute 35 5, 55 5, and 33 5% of total viral particles for WT, H273R, and G64S PV respectively. RT-qPCR was performed using purified RNA to determine genome copies. we conclude that the H273R substitution reduces replication fidelity of the PV RdRp. this mutation appears to drive the virus population over the maximum tolerated mutation frequency, which over time leads to extinction of finite virus populations. cPVR mice (4\u20136 weeks old) were infected by either intraperitoneal (A\u2013C) or intramuscular (D\u2013F) injection with serum-free media containing WT or H273R PV (B and E) at the indicated titer (pfu) and observed for 14 days. intraperitoneal inoculation revealed that the low fidelity H273R virus exhibited restricted tissue tropism. i.m. injection (F) for WT and H273R PV were 2 107 and 1 109 pfu. PD50 values were determined by the Reed and Muench method. mice were challenged 4 weeks after immunization with 5PD50 of WT PV. mice that developed two-limb paralysis were euthanized. survival curves for mice immunized with H273R PV at 107 pfu or greater were significantly higher than those for mice immunized with control serum-free media alone. inviability was not attributable to inactive polymerase as evaluation of these variants revealed high levels of replication. additional studies will be required to fully understand this observation. amino acid 273 is located in the fingers subdomain of the enzyme, remote from the active site. to address the impact of the H273R mutation on PV RdRp activity, we engineered the H273R mutation into the WT PV RdRp expression construct (18). the H273R RdRp derivative was compared with WT and G64S RdRp derivatives. H273R RdRp incorporated GMP and ribavirin monophosphate more efficiently than both WT and the high fidelity variant G64S RdRp. a, values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies. incorporation efficiency of H273R RdRp were elevated by 2- and 5-fold, respectively, relative to WT. in both cases, the misincorporation was caused by an increase in apparent affinity (Kd, app) for the incorrect nucleotide and an increase in the observed rate constant for nucleotide incorporation (kpol) these results indicate that the recombinant, purified PV RdRp carrying the H273R substitution has a lower capacity to discriminate we conclude that the growth properties and genetic stability of H273R are similar to those observed for WT PV. we conclude that the biological consequences of increasing mutation frequency are similar to those observed for WT PV. a 50% increase in mutations was observed in H273R, averaging 3.0 mutations per genome. the observed mutation frequencies from sequencing reflect averages at multiple locations within a specific genomic region (VP1). a significant difference in the number of mutations was observed between WT and H273R PV. values reported for WT and H273R PV virus are taken from Ref. 4. m.o.i. for WT, G64S, and H273R PV in the absence of ribavirin was 3.5 108, 1.8 108, and 1.6 108, respectively. the titer (pfu/ml) after infection at high m.o.i. was 1.9 107, 4.7 107, and 1.8 107, respectively. data are means from three independent experiments. luciferase activity produced from translation and replication of a subgenomic replicon suggested that replication of H273R may be slower than WT. but this observation might result simply from the reduced specific activity of luciferase caused by the increased mutational load in the luciferase-coding sequence. ranked order of mutation types was identical when H273R PV was compared with WT PV (Table 1). Mutational spectrum determined by using CirSeq H273R PV Exhibits Reduced Fitness in Cell Culture Relative to WT PV Lethal mutagenesis is a prediction of population genetics theory. shown is the surviving progeny virus (pfu) after serial/blind passage of WT, G64S, and H273R PV at an initial m.o.i. of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1. D, inoculum size and mutation frequency affect sustainability of virus population. shown is the calculated range for each virus. G\u2013I, progeny of virus relative to the starting inoculum for each infection. data are means from five independent experiments. the loss of fitness of H273R was not observed at higher multiplicities of infection (Fig. 4D, WT control is shown in Fig. 4E). this observation is consistent with the theory that extinction of virus populations through lethal mutagenesis should depend on burst size (5). all of the experiments presented above were performed using the pfu as the quantifiable measure of infectious virus. when we performed blind serial passages of H273R at low multiplicities of infection, we routinely observed extinction as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. however, if we quantified the viral titer again using pfu, then extinction was never observed. RT-qPCR was performed using purified RNA to determine genome copies. we conclude that the H273R substitution reduces replication fidelity of the PV RdRp. this mutation appears to drive the virus population over the maximum tolerated mutation frequency, which over time leads to extinction of finite virus populations. intracranial inoculation showed that H273R PV replicated in brain equivalently to WT. however, H273R PV was still unable to make it to the spinal cord. these data are consistent with restrictions in neurons giving rise to the observed phenotype. the statistical significance of differences in virus load in brain (H) or in spinal cord (I) between WT and H273R after intracranial inoculation was determined by the Mann-Whitney test. H273R PV elicited PV-specific neutralizing antibodies. survival curves for mice immunized with H273R PV at 107 pfu or greater were significantly higher than those for mice immunized with control serum-free media. we challenged the vaccinated mice with a lethal (5PD50) intraperitoneal inoculation of WT PV 1 month after immunization. however, this low fidelity variant elicits a strong immune response that confers protection. Error bars represent S.E. Plaques were not observed for H273A, H273N, H273G, H273P, and H273F mutants. luciferase-specific activity is reported in relative light units. the H273R RdRp derivative was compared with WT and G64S RdRp derivatives. all three enzymes showed the same efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation. the reduced fidelity of nucleotide addition by H273R RdRp was further supported by the appearance of products greater than n + 1. H273R RdRp incorporated GMP and ribavirin monophosphate more efficiently than both WT and the high fidelity variant G64S RdRp. the relative fidelity or error frequency is shown, (kpol/Kd, app)corr/(kpol/Kd, app)incorr) values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies (1, 20, 20) H273R RNA produced by in vitro transcription of the mutated cDNA was infectious in HeLa cells, albeit with a 1.4-fold lower specific infectivity than observed for WT RNA. the plaque size of the mutant was slightly smaller than observed for WT, suggesting that the fitness of H273R may be somewhat reduced. HeLa cells were infected with 50 pfu of either WT or H273R PV. after 2\u20134 days of incubation, the agarose overlay was removed. cells were stained with crystal violet. a 50% increase in mutations was observed in H273R, averaging 3.0 mutations per genome. a phenotypic assay for the presence of viral mutants resistant to guanidine (guar), an inhibitor of PV genome replication, was consistent with the sequencing analysis. Plaque numbers were plotted against ribavirin concentration normalized to untreated (0 mm) control. the solid line represents the fit of the data to a sigmoidal dose response equation (four-parameter logistic model) a high fidelity variant of the PV RdRp, G64S, exhibits reduced sensitivity to ribavirin in cell culture (1\u20134). the effect of ribavirin was more pronounced at low multiplicities of infection (compare Fig. 3, C with D) the specific activity of luciferase varied as a function of polymerase fidelity. we conclude that information on replication kinetics and/or yield should not be inferred from reporter enzyme activity when the virus variant exhibits a fidelity phenotype. shown is the surviving progeny virus (pfu) for WT, G64S, and H273R PV at 6 h post-infection using the indicated inoculum (pfu) shown is the surviving progeny virus (pfu) after serial passage of WT, G64S, and H273R PV at an initial m.o.i. of 0.001. shown is the surviving progeny virus (pfu) after serial/blind passage of WT PV at an initial m.o.i. of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1. for experiments shown in C\u2013E, HeLa cell monolayers were infected at the indicated m.o.i. of P1 virus, were allowed to proceed for 8 h, and then viruses were harvested. we evaluated the yield of virus produced 6 and 8 h post-infection over a 9-log range of virus concentrations, expressed as m.o.i. (pfu/cell) of 106 for H273R, at 107 for WT, and at 108 for G64S PV. this result provides additional experimental evidence supporting RNA virus population dynamics predicted by population genetics theory. optimal mutation rate can be modulated by amino acid substitutions within the RdRp. we observed population extinction and maximum fecundity. determinants of packaging are sensitive to mutational load. digital PCR to quantify standards used in conventional RT-qPCR experiments to measure virus titers as genomes or genomes/ml. this value increased to 500 100 genomes for H273R PV. RT-qPCR was performed using purified RNA to determine genome copies. H273R is attenuated in vivo due to the inability to overcome the effect of bottlenecking on population size during infection. we predicted that H273R would be attenuated in vivo, where the virus is challenged by host defense mechanisms, diverse cellular environments in different tissues. the number of mice per group was n = 15 (i.p.) and n = 5 (i.m.) PD50 values by i.m. injection (C) for WT and H273R PV were 2 107 and 1 109 pfu, respectively. immunized mice were challenged 4 weeks after immunization with 5PD50 of WT PV (1 108 pfu) by i.p. injection and observed for 14 days. survival curves for mice immunized with H273R PV at 107 pfu or greater were significantly higher than those for mice immunized with control serum-free media. u exhibited complete protection against lethal challenge by WT PV. however, this low fidelity variant elicits a strong immune response. u exhibited complete protection against lethal challenge by WT PV. H273R Substitution in PV RdRp Produces a mutator phenotype in Vitro. a mutation in our N297E RdRp clone changed His-273 to Arg. fidelity of nucleotide is uridine compared with WT and G64S RdRp. otide addition by H273R RdRp was further supported by the appearance of products greater than n + 1 when ATP and RTP were used as substrates. these data suggest that H273R RdRp is a mutator polymerase. a, values for WT and G64S RdRp were taken from previous studies (1, 20, 20) a quantitative pre-steady-state kinetic characterization of H273R RdRp was performed. the GMP misincorporation efficiency and ribavirin monophosphate incorporation efficiency of H273R RdRp were elevated by 2-fold, respectively, relative to WT. four consecutive passages of H273R at low multiplicities of infection showed no evidence of genetic changes in polymerase-coding sequence. luciferase-expressing subgenomic replicon observed a subtle delay in H273R replication with respect to WT. by 6 h the mutant reached WT levels of replication. data are means from three independent experiments. Error bars represent S.E. D, kinetics of RNA synthesis using a luciferase-expressing subgenomic replicon. the phenotypic assay (guar) provides the frequency of a specific transition mutation in the genome. the arginine substitution at position 273 of the PV RdRp significantly increases the virus mutation rate. the percentage of surviving virus for WT, G64S, and H273R PV after infecting HeLa cells at either low (m.o.i. of 0.01, C) or high (m.o.i. of 5, D) m.o.i. in the presence of increasing concentrations of ribavirin. the titer (pfu/ml) after infection at low m.o.i. for WT, G64S, and H27 we predicted low fidelity variants of the PV RdRp would exhibit enhanced sensitivity to ribavirin. the effect of ribavirin was more pronounced at low multiplicities of infection (compare Fig. 3, C with D) the effect of ribavirin was more pronounced at low multiplicities of infection. fragmented RNA is circularized and the circularized template was copied reiteratively in a process of rolling-circle reverse transcription (23, 24). the most striking finding was that the fold-change in mutation frequency observed for H273R PV relative to WT PV could be separated into two categories. shown is the percentage of WT and H273R PV remaining after 1\u20134 serial passages. shown is the surviving progeny virus (pfu) for WT, G64S, and H273R PV at 6 h post-infection using the indicated inoculum (pfu) titer of virus (pfu/ml) produced during P2 for each virus/m.o.i. pair was assumed to be constant (i.e. dose-response ratio), and this titer was then used to calculate the amount of the virus required to achieve m.o.i. of 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 for subsequent passage infections. RNA virus population dynamics predicted by population genetics theory. we compared the fecundity of H273R with that of WT and G64S at a low m.o.i. over eight generations. the only difference between these PV variants was their RdRp replication fidelity. TEM images are shown of WT (A), H273R (B), and G64S PV (C). Empty particles constitute 35 5, 55 5, and 33 5% of total viral particles for WT, H273R, and G64S PV respectively. new tab Extinction of viral populations at fixed number of viral genomes. total genome copies (output) for WT (A) and H273R (B) at 8 h post-infection. cPVR mice were infected by either intraperitoneal (A\u2013C) or intramuscular (D\u2013F) injection with serum-free media containing WT or H273R PV (B and E) at the indicated titer (pfu) and observed for 14 days. intraperitoneal inoculation revealed that the low fidelity H273R virus exhibited restricted tissue tropism. PD50 values by i.m. injection (F) for WT and H273R PV were 2 107 and 1 109 pfu, respectively. pfu/g values were determined by the Reed and Muench method. mice immunized by i.p. injection with H273R PV or mock immunized with serum-free media alone (naive) were challenged 4 weeks after immunization with 5PD50 of WT PV (1 108 pfu) by i.p. injection and observed for 14 days. survival curves for mice immunized with H273R PV at 107 pfu or greater were significantly higher than those for mice immunized with control serum- mutations at position 273 other than Arg significantly impact PV replication. cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 g of viral RNA. cells were washed and overlaid with agarose media. viral populations exhibiting decreased or increased genetic diversity are attenuated but replicate in the host and elicit a protective immune response (4, 14, 16, 26). together, these observations suggest an optimal genetic diversity for a viral population to survive. population genetics predicts a log-linear relationship between fecundity and mutation rate. a 2-fold decrease in mutation frequency leads to a 5-fold increase in fecundity; a 3-fold increase in mutation frequency leads to a 10-fold decrease in fecundity. both of these experimental observations are likely akin to responses of the H273R population to bottlenecks in the host. the orange circle represents viruses exhibiting a mutational load and fecundity near that of WT capable of exhibiting the most virulent phenotype. the solid line represents the fit of the data to a line yielding a y-intercept of 4.5 0.7 and a slope of 1.5 0.3. a plot of mutations per genome versus fecundity defined a line that predicts a maximum fecundity of 103 and certain extinction at a value of 4.5 mutations per genome. this plot also makes it very evident that the number of solutions that will lead to WT virulence is likely small. recent studies of the attenuated K359R mutant suggest that a third dimension of speed should be considered when considering viral population dynamics. an oxidized guanine (29) has not been studied for PV. it is also unknown how efficient and faithful the RdRp is during damage bypass. it is also unknown how efficient and faithful the mutant is during damage bypass."}
