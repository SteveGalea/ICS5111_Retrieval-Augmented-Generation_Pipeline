{"summary": "apoD has been characterized as a 29-kDa secreted glycoprotein. it is a member of the family of lipocalins responsible for the binding and transport of small lipophilic molecules. it is known to bind more specifically to arachidonic acid (AA),2 progesterone, and sphingomyelin. neuronal overexpression of apoD in transgenic mice led to increased resistance to oxidative stress (25) and inflammation (26). apoD deletion in mice resulted in decreased resistance and survival in response to oxidative stress in the brain (25). apoD could specifically prevent lipid peroxidation through a highly conserved methionine residue. 293T cells and SH-SY5Y cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. radiolabeling of HapoD Human apoD (HapoD), purified from breast cyst

4 h. the results show that BSG down-regulation has no effect on transferrin uptake in 293T cells. cyclophilin A does not compete with transferrin. confocal microscopy assessed the effect of biot-apoD internalization on SH-SY5Y cells with or without overexpression of BSG. the low BSG expression (Aa) in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a decrease of biot-HapoD internalization (Ab) exogenous apoD internalized into vesicular compartments of 293T cells. treatment with a concentration of cyclophilin A similar to that of exogenous apoD had no effect on apoD internalization (Fig. 5, J\u2013L) but completely blocked exogenous apoD internalization (Fig. 5, G\u2013I) BSG is a multifunctional cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein that has two extracellular Ig domains (46, 47) it has been reported that BSG is widely expressed in many tissues, including in the brain (39, 48\u201350) in the brain, BSG is strongly expressed in the limbic system (including the hippocampus, olfactory system), cortex, and cerebellum (51). elevated BSG expression enhances tumor invasion by stimulating the secretion of multiple matrix metalloproteinases. the high glycosylated form of BSG, HG-BSG, is presumed to be a precursor for HG-BSG formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. the high HG:LG ratio is highly correlated with the lymphatic metastasis abilities of hepatocarcinoma cell lines (72). the impairment of spatial memory tasks (76, 77) and the inflammation induced by traumatic brain injury (77) suggest a tight relationship between apoD and caveolin 1. apoD internalization is followed by the endocytosis of BSG, leading to the redistribution of BSG. the colocalization of exogenous apoD internalized and basigin suggest that apoD can follow the same endocytosis pathway as basigin for its internalization process. this study is the first to identify BSG, more particularly LG-BSG, as a receptor essential for apoD internalization."}
