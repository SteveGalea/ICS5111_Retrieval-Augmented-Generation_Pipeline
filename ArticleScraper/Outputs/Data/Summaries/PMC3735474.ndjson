{"summary": "estimates of parameters for disease transmission in large-scale infectious disease outbreaks are often obtained to represent large groups of people, providing an average over a potentially very diverse area. methods We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. with this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. post hoc analyses of an outbreak may include estimation of the time-varying effective reproductive number, Rt. this represents the impact on R0 of acquired immunity and public health interventions that typically lead to decreased transmission. the issue is made even more complex because reporting issues and healthcare seeking behaviors can vary geographically and also influence data quality. method originally proposed by wallinga and Teunis [1] to estimate the effective reproductive number. this modification allows for the estimation of the reproductive number in the presence of greater heterogeneity in transmission. we apply this method to data from the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak in South Africa and estimate the reproductive number for each province. spatial transmission data We propose the use of additional structure to describe the probability of an infectious event occurring between two cases. we modify the probability of an infectious event between two cases, P(tj\u2032 ti), to incorporate spatial information: P t \u2032 j t i = p t i t \u2032 j d t i \u2032 t j. there are nine provinces in south africa that vary substantially in size, population density, climate, and accessibility to healthcare [10]. the symptom onset date was available in 758 cases (6% of the cases). we first fit a Poisson model to the lag between onset date and collection date for those who had both dates recorded (715 cases) EC FS GT KZN LP MP NC NW WC EC 1.0000 0.0069 0.0479 0.0190 0.0118 0.0095 0.0026 0.0070 0.0293 FS 0.0085 1.0000 0.0251 0.0100 0.0062 0.0050 0.0014 0.0036 0.0153 GT 0.0248 0.0105 1.0000 0.0291 0.0180 0.0146 0.0040 0.0107 0.0449 KZN 0.0240 0.0102 0.0711 1.0000 0.

Increased transmission between those in the same province, i.e. dij=2 if i and j are in the same province and dij=1 otherwise. this is an attempt at giving more weight to infection between individuals within a state, but allowing for infection from an individual from another state. a less extreme isolation model could entertain values other than 1 and 2 for elements of this matrix. all analyses were performed in R 2.13.0 (http://www.r-project.org). programs are available upon request to the author. the symptom onset date was available in 758 cases (6% of the cases) we impute the missing onset dates using a multiple imputation method. to this end, we first fit a Poisson model to the lag between onset date and collection date for those who had both dates recorded (715 cases) EC FS GT KZN LP MP NC NW WC EC 1.0000 0.0069 0.0479 0.0190 0.0118 0.0095 0.0026 0.0070 0.0293 FS 0.0085 1.0000 0.0251 0.0100 0.0062 0.0050 0.0014 0.0036 0.0153 GT 0.0248 0.0105 1.0000 0.0291 0.0180 0.0146 0.0040 0.0107 0.0449 KZN 0.0240 0.0102 0.0711 1.0000 0. increased transmission for neighboring provinces EC FS GT KZN LP MP NC NW WC EC 2 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0.5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 d. Neighboring provinces up-weighted. we define a similarity metric such that if i and j are in the same province the similarity is 2, if they are in neighboring provinces the similarity is 1, otherwise the similarity is 0.5. all analyses were performed in R 2.13.0 (http://www.r-project.org). results Figures 1 and 2 show a sample of the imputed epidemic curves first overall (Figure 1) and then for each of the nine provinces (Figure 2). the biggest differences are between the original WT method (Matrix a) and the methods using a nonhomogeneous transmission matrix (Matrix b-e) those using a similarity matrix implying heterogeneity are almost identical to each other, but quite different from the value obtained by the original WT method that assumes homogeneity. the period considered is the 60 days of the outbreak when the epidemic curve was growing exponentially. results are the median of the results from the imputed datasets with the range from the 500 datasets shown in parenthesis. the estimates of R0 are plotted against the population size, land area and population density. the relationship between characteristics of each of the provinces and the outbreak. the first panel shows the relationship between population size and the size of the outbreak in each province. the final panel plots the relationship between population density and R0 for each transmission matrix. we show results for various transmission matrices in order to quantify the degree to which transmission occurs between provinces. four of these matrices are somewhat arbitrary and not based on actual data. despite the substantial differences in the matrices, the result is the same: transmission is maintained in more urban areas and rural areas fail to sustain transmission. assuming homogeneity within a province is more general than assuming homogeneity over the entire country, it is still a substantial assumption that ignores potentially important variations within a province. a recent cross sectional, serum study reports differential exposure to influenza strains in china across five communities. the climate across south africa is variable with some of the more rural provinces being characterized by a drier climate. the country\u2019s climate is mostly semi-arid, but subtropical along the east coast. however, it does not appear that the humidity hypothesis is borne out by these data. our study introduces a novel approach for doing this by making use of the epidemic curve, information on the serial interval distribution and some prior knowledge of transmission dynamics. the modification proposed by Cauchemez et al could be implemented straightforwardly with this modification."}
