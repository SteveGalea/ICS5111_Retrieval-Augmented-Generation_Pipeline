{"summary": "a systematic search of published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a referent CXR or chest CT scan and/or clinical criteria for pneumonia in adults aged 18 years. results Our initial search strategy yielded 2726 articles. general practitioners and emergency medicine physicians should be encouraged to learn LUS because it appears to be an established diagnostic tool in hands of experienced physicians. the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia has remained constant over the last few decades affecting 3\u20135 people per 1000 person-years. use of lung ultrasound has long been limited to diagnosis of pleural effusions, thoracentesis and biopsy-guided procedures. but it has recently been shown to be highly effective in evaluating pulmonary conditions such as pneumonia and pneumothorax [18,19]. literature search and data analysis was performed between June and July 2013. the literature search and data analysis was performed between June and July 2013.

QUADAS-2 categorizes the risk of bias and study generalizability as low, unclear or high. both reviewers (MC, NS and WC) scored the 7-item tool independently. disagreements were resolved via consensus. two studies used lung subunits as independent observations. in one study each patient contributed information for each hemithorax [38] and in another each patient contributed information for twelve lung regions [32]. Figure 1. Mean age was 59 years (range 18 to 95) seven studies (70%) had a highly-skilled physician perform LUS [21,22,31,32,34-36], but only three adequately defined the degree of expertise. one study (10%) did not comment on operator expertise [38]. all studies assessed tests independently and blinded from standard imaging results. five studies (50%) used combination of clinical criteria and imaging as the reference standard. three studies (30%) used chest CT scan for the diagnosis of pneumonia in the entire sample [32,33,38] and two (20%) studies used chest CT scan when the results of CXR and LUS were discordant [35,37].

LUS had a pooled sensitivity of 94% (95% CI, 92% to 96%) and pooled specificity of 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%) [21,22,31,32,34-36] in studies that used ED physicians or general practitioners (n = 2), LUS had a high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (96%) for the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults. u.s. meta-analyses identified a clear advantage of LUS over standard imaging for pneumonia. some studies excluded certain populations such as pregnant women [22,35,37] and patients with suspicion of aspiration pneumonia [35], severe immunosuppression [22], interstitial lung disease [34,36,37]. included studies did not assess all lung regions, as some patients were bedridden and posterior zones were difficult to be assessed.
