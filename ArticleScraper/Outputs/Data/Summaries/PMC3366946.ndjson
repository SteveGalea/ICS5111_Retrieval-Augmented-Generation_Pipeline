{"summary": "recombination has not been detected in several viruses despite repeated searches. many sub-genotypes were identified by polygenetic analysis as recombinants. there is no direct evidence to indicate that these subgenotypes arose. novel viral genomes within an individual with a multiple genotype infection would be consistent with the hypothesis that they arose within the individual with multiple genotype infections. all the families were from a district located at the boundary of Gansu and Qinghai provinces. PCR was performed using the primers and thermocycling conditions described by G\u00fcnther to obtain full-length HBV genome. a nested PCR was used to produce two overlapping fragments in subjects with low HBV DNA levels. the spanning of fragment A cover nucleotides 2813 to 1824, and fragment B included nucleotides 1821 to 237. phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method. bootstrap resampling and reconstruction were carried out 1000 times. 15 families enrolled 68 patients with chronic HBV infection. all the families were from a district located at the boundary of Gansu and Qinghai provinces. none received anti-viral therapy or immunosuppressant drugs. fragment B included nucleotides 2813 to 1824, and fragment B included nucleotides 1821 to 237. la-taq (TAKARA, Japan) and high-fidelity polymerase COD-FX (TOYOBO, Japan) were used to produce amplimers for cloning and direct sequencing respectively. phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 5. a genotype F sequence (GenBank accession numbers is X75658 and X75663) was used as external reference. family Y with affected members across two generations and two genotypes/subgenotypes. father (Y2) of family Y with triplicate infection of genotype C, D and CD recombinant. mother (Y2W) and granddaughter (Y3F) were infected with the CD1 recombinant. father (Y2) had triplicate infections of genotype C2, D1 and CD recombinant. grandmother (Y1W) and grandson (Y3M) had genotype D1. a phylogenetic tree constructed from HBV nt 36-1110 of novel recombinants clones of Y2 is given in Figure 2C. the dotted clones are from Y2. the topology of phylogenetic tree with recombinants is totally different from typical trees. the size of switch region share the same sequence are different in different strains. the size of switch region share the same sequence are different in different strains. the bars indicate the number of clones (y axis) showing recombination crossover regions. genetype C2, D1 and CD1 recombinant clones of Y2 were all used as parental sequences to recombine with each other to form new recombinants. in 16 clones of fragment B, there were four genotype C (Y2-23,71,78,75); one CD1 (Y2-29) and four novel C/D recombinants (Y2-212,21 73,77). mixed-genotype Infections in HBV Cluster Families Different HBV genotypes were found in three families among 15 families. Flow of participants in the study and family trees of families with mixed genotypes/subgenotypes HBV infection. family Y affected members across three generations and three genotypes/subgenotypes. in 2006, the grandmother (Q1W) and grandson (Q3M) were infected with CD1 recombinant while father (Q2) and granddaughter (Q3F) had mixed infections of genotype C2 and CD1 recombinants. phylogenetic tree construct from HBV nt136-1110 from the clones of families Q and V is given. clones of family Q (indicated by black triangles) exhibit two clusters of subgenotypes C2 and CD1. dotted clones are from Y2. the region where recombination breakpoints had the highest probabilities was recognized as crossover region. upstream sequence of crossover region will have specific mutation of one genotype but with no specific mutation of another, downstream just opposite. the size of switch region share the same sequence are different in different strains. Y2-B1\u2032B22: clones from fragment C of Y2 patients. number on x axis consistent with site of nucleotides of HBV genome. black lines are sequence that is common to recombining genotypes. in 16 clones of fragment B, there were four genotype C (Y2-23,71,78,75); seven genotype D (Y2-25, 27,79,76,72,22,210); one CD1 (Y2-29) and four novel C/D recombinants (Y2-212,21 73,77). no recombinants of genotype B were found. two or more strains of HBV can recombinate at any region along the genome. the length of crossover region depends on the location of it on the genome. if it is located in a conserved HBV region, the length may be long. recombination suggests parental sequences of CD1 and CD2 recombinants. in vitro results showed replication capacity of individual clone, exclude the influence of host and other strains of quasi-species. studies of HBV in endemic areas have resulted in large numbers of full genome sequences available for phylogenetic analysis enabling the identification of novel, mosaic HBV genomes. the first stage is the co-circulation of different HBV strains or genotypes in the same geographic area. the third is the generation of a novel recombinant strain within an individual. phylogenetic trees and homology calculations show ten genotypes that differ from each other in nucleotide sequence by 7.5 to 13%. existence of a recombinant makes the topology of the phylogenetic tree totally different from one with no recombinant. recombinants always clustered with the backbone parental sequence, with which they have high similarity with the larger proportion of the recombination region. mixed HBV genotypes infection with many novel recombinants ended up with just one genotype 18 months later in this study. this may indicate that the detectable mixed infection and recombination have a limited time window due to the sensitivity of detection or strong selection power of the host. a new standard may be required for classifying HBV sequences. the black lines are sequence that is common to the recombining genotypes, and within which the recombination probably occurred. deep green lines are genotype C2, deep pink lines are genotype D1, light pink lines are the C2 component of genotype recombinant CD1. the black lines are sequence that is common to the recombining genotypes. the black lines are sequence that is common to the recombining genotypes. the black lines are sequence that is common to the recombining genotypes."}
