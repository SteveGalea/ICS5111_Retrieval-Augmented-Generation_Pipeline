{"summary": "bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a pneumovirus of the paramyxoviridae family. the infection is prevalent worldwide (Elvander 1996, Paton and others 1998, Uttenthal and others 2000, Klem and others 2013) testing of antibodies in BTM is a reliable tool for identification of BRSV-negative herds. cost-effective methods to classify the infection status of herds are of interest for several reasons. such knowledge can be used to reduce the risk of virus transmission when animals are traded. four repeated screenings of dairy herds in a region BTM samples were collected from herds with 20 or more cow-years. in total, 108 herds met the criteria, representing 60 per cent of the total number of herds in this county. three of these herds were excluded due to the use of a vaccine against BRSV. ds that seroconverted from negative to positive on BTM testing were invited to participate in the individual survey. the 10 herds with an increase in antibody level equal to or higher than 20% positivity (PP) measured by an indirect ELISA were invited to participate and included. blood (serum) and individual milk samples from all lactating cows were collected from these herds after the second BTM screening, from March to April 2010. an indirect ELISA (SVANOVIR BRSV-Ab, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to analyse antibodies against BRSV. the serum was diluted 1:25 with PBS-Tween buffer and the milk was analysed undiluted. the sensitivity and specificity of the tests reported by the manufacturer were 94.6 per cent and 100 per cent. four repeated screenings of dairy herds in a region BTM samples were collected from herds with 20 or more cow-years. in total, 108 herds met the criteria, representing 60% of the total number of herds in this county. three of these herds were excluded due to the use of a vaccine against BRSV. blood (serum) and individual milk samples from all lactating cows were collected from these herds after the second BTM screening, from March to April 2010. animals younger than five months were not included to avoid interference of maternally derived antibodies. an indirect ELISA (SVANOVIR BRSV-Ab, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to analyse antibodies against BRSV, following the manufacturer's instructions. the serum was diluted 1:25 with PBS-Tween buffer and the milk was analysed undiluted as recommended by the manufacturer. TM of the four screenings varied from 83 per cent to 85 per cent. the results of the 89 herds sampled at all four occasions are presented in Fig 1. the majority of herds were positive for antibodies against BRSV. the results of four consecutive sampling occasions are shown. the herds are divided into four different categories based on the results of the first and last samplings. the lines are based on the mean PP values of each category on the four sampling occasions. in eight of the herds, all the tested young stock was positive. in three of the herds, all the young stock up to a certain age was positive. the time of exposure was presumed to be between the age of the oldest negative and the youngest positive animal. the time since infection is based on analyses of antibodies in serum from the lactating cows and younger animals. the lower limit is defined by the age of the oldest animal negative for BRSV antibodies and the upper limit by the youngest positive animal. a BRSV infection occurred in the herds in December 2009 (herd 1) and January 2010 (herd 2). Fig 5 presents the descending level of antibodies in series of diluted samples. the form of the curve for each herd is similar, although the start PP value differs distinctly from PP 36 (herd 3) to 108 (herd 2). for serum the numbers of dilution 1 through 4 represent dilution at a ratio of 1:12.5, 1:25, 1:50 and 1:100. the majority of herds were positive for antibodies against BRSV in the first and the last samplings. negative and positive herds were found in close proximity. 77.5 per cent (69 out of 89) were positive in both, and 9.0 per cent were negative in both. the herds are divided into four different categories based on the results from the first and last samplings. the lines are based on the mean PP values of each category on the four sampling occasions. 23 (34 per cent) reported signs of respiratory disease in the herd within the period from September 2009 to February 2010. 9 of the 11 herds had a recent infection (17 months ago) the results indicated that BRSV had not been in the herd for the last five to seven years. the level of antibodies detected was also lowest for these herds. the time since infection is based on analyses of antibodies in serum from the lactating cows and younger animals. the lower limit is defined by the age of the oldest animal negative for BRSV antibodies and the upper limit by the youngest positive animal. the time since infection is indicated as less than the age of the youngest sampled animal PP, per cent positivity Study 3. Fig 5 presents the descending level of antibodies in series of diluted BTM samples from 11 herds. the form of the curve for each herd is similar, although the start PP value differs distinctly from PP 36 (herd 3) to 108 (herd 2). herds were classified based on serological findings in a group of young animals. testing using BTM has lower power with regard to correct classification of a herd's virus status than testing of individual milk samples and serum from young animals. the level of antibodies in the BTM is influenced by the composition of the milking herd. the immune status (antibody levels against BRSV) of the individual cows, the milk yield and which animals contribute to the bulk tank milk are the main reasons for fluctuating levels of antibodies. the antibody level in the BTM samples decreased slightly at the end of the study period. however, the continuous large fluctuations only weeks apart indicates that guidelines based on antibody level in BTM might not be suitable for BRSV. the antibody level in BTM will remain high for at least four years after a BRSV infection, even without reinfection."}
