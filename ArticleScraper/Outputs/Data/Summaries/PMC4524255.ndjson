{"summary": "HTLV-1 encodes viral oncoprotein Tax, which drives the initiation and progression of ATL. tax activates HTLV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) and many cellular proto-oncogenes and immunoregulatory genes. CREB-regulating transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) are required for tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR (13\u201315) several cellular protein kinases, including p21-activated kinases, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), and salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) are influential in this process (16, 17) small-molecule activators of SIRT1 such as resveratrol have been extensively tested for prevention and treatment of diseases in clinical trials. resveratrol is a natural compound found in the skin of red grapes and widely sold as a nutritional supplement. plasmids pLTR-Luc and pB-Luc have been detailed elsewhere (17, 27\u201329) tax expression is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (30\u201332). Rabbit anti-V5, mouse anti-tubulin, and mouse anti-Flag were purchased from invitrogen. HTLV-1-transformed cells were grown to confluence and harvested to 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. cells were washed and cell lysis was performed in presence of protease inhibitor cocktail. the DNA-protein complex was immunoprecipitated and the DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform. the sequence spanning the three 21-bp Tax-responsive elements in HTLV-1 LTR was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with primers 5\u2032-GGCTTAGAGCCTCCCAGTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTCCTGAACTGTCTCCACGC-3\u2032. RNA interference experiments were performed as described previously (17, 36) MT2 cells were seeded at 106/ml overnight in culture medium in the presence of escalating amounts of resveratrol (10, 20, or 40 M) the supernatant from Jurkat cells was used as a negative control. HTLV-1 viruses were resuspended in 100 l of lysis buffer. expression plasmids for tax, CREB, and SIRT1 have been detailed elsewhere (17, 27\u201329) tax expression is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (30\u201332). Rabbit anti-V5, mouse anti-tubulin, and mouse anti-Flag were purchased from invitrogen. NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM -glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. antigen-antibody complex was collected with protein G agarose (Invitrogen), washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. HTLV-1-transformed cells (MT2, MT4, and C8166) the DNA sequence spanning the three 21-bp Tax-responsive elements in HTLV-1 LTR was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with primers 5\u2032-GGCTTAGAGCCTCCCAGTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTCCTGAACTGTCTCCACGC-3\u2032. RNA interference experiments were performed as described previously (17, 36) MT2 cells were seeded at 106/ml overnight in the presence of resveratrol (10, 20, or 40 M) jurkat cells were seeded at 5 105/ml and transfected with pLTR-Luc and pRL-TK for 24 h. RESULTS SIRT1 inhibits Tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR. HEK293 cells were transfected with pB-FLuc/pSV-RLuc reporters and plasmids expressing Tax and SIRT1 (WT or HY) no statistically significant difference was found between groups 2 and 4 by two-tailed Student's t test. the differences between groups 4 and 5 and between groups 4 and 6 are statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t test. the differences between groups 4 and 5 and between groups 4 and 6 are statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t test. 93 cells with increasing amounts of resveratrol abrogated tax-mediated LTR transactivation progressively. expression of tax protein driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter remained unchanged upon administration of resveratrol. treatment of cells with 20 M resveratrol did not affect tax-induced activation of NF-B activity. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pB-FLuc/pSV-RLuc reporters and tax expression plasmid. no statistically significant difference was found between groups 2 and 4 by two-tailed Student's t test. resveratrol suppressed tax-mediated LTR transcription in a SIRT1-dependent manner. resveratrol suppressed proviral transcription, virion production, and cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1. repressed tax and Env mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in all three lines. expression of tax protein was also diminished in resveratrol-treated cells. resveratrol suppress proviral transcription of HTLV-1. expression of tax and -tubulin was detected by Western blotting. RT-qPCR was performed as for panel A. difference between groups 1 and 5 is statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t test. resveratrol blocked the transmission of HTLV-1 from MT2 cells to uninfected Jurkat cells in coculture. resveratrol blocked the transmission of HTLV-1 from MT2 cells to uninfected Jurkat cells in coculture. we immunoprecipitated tax from cells expressing SIRT1 or its HY mutant. the steady-state amount of acetylated Tax decreased in presence of SIRT1 but increased when SIRT1-HY was expressed. the indicated proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells. luciferase assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. no statistically significant difference was found between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.14), groups 2 and 4 (P = 0. 067), groups 6 and 7 (P = 0.24) or groups 6 and 8 (P = 0.73) by two-tailed Student's t test. the catalytically inactive HY mutant of SIRT1 retained the ability to associate with Tax. similar experiments were also done with MT2, MT4 and C8166 cells. the endogenous SIRT1 band in the MT2 precipitate was less prominent. resveratrol suppressed tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR through SIRT1. in addition, resveratrol suppressed tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR through SIRT1. to test this idea, we coexpressed SIRT1 or its HY mutant together with Tax and CREB. the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with mouse anti-Flag and anti-V5. the input lysates were also immunoblotted for flag-CREB, tax-V5, and GAPDH. CREB is a master regulator of cell metabolism and a bona fide oncoprotein. SIRT1 and resveratrol also prevent the interaction between tax and CREB. resveratrol represses HTLV-1 transcription by restricting LTR occupancy of CREB, CRTC1 and p300. CRTC1-, or p300-bound DNA complex was immunoprecipitated using anti-CREB (A), anti-CRTC1 (B), or anti-p300 (C) the tax-responsive sequence was PCR amplified. Relative recruitments in the irrelevant IgG precipitate were taken as basal values. HEK293 cells were transfected with pB-FLuc/pSV-RLuc reporters and plasmids expressing Tax and SIRT1 (WT or HY) no statistically significant difference was found between groups 2 and 4 by two-tailed Student's t test. expression of SIRT1 or its HY mutant had no influence on tax-induced activation of NF-B. we depleted SIRT1 expression in HEK293 cells using two independent siRNAs. resveratrol inhibits tax activation of LTR in a SIRT1-dependent manner. treatment of cells with 20 M resveratrol did not affect tax-induced activation of NF-B activity. suppression of tax activation of NF-B by resveratrol was observed only at the high concentration of 40 M. expression of tax and -tubulin (-tub) was verified by Western blotting. cells were treated with 20 and 40 M resveratrol. no statistically significant difference was found between groups 2 and 4 by two-tailed Student's t test. resveratrol suppressed tax-mediated LTR transcription in a SIRT1-dependent manner. resveratrol suppressed tax-mediated LTR activation in a SIRT1-dependent manner. resveratrol suppresses proviral transcription, virion production, and cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1. resveratrol and SIRT1 suppress proviral transcription of HTLV-1. MT2, MT4 and C8166 cells were treated with increasing doses (20 and 40 M) of resveratrol (Res) for 24 h. expression of tax and -tubulin (-tub) was detected by Western blotting. RT-qPCR was performed as for panel A. difference between groups 1 and 5 is statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t test. we applied two different SIRT1-specific inhibitors, sirtinol and Ex527, individually to C8166 cells. resveratrol disrupted the production of cell-free HTLV-1 virions. the steady-state amount of acetylated Tax decreased in presence of SIRT1 but increased when SIRT1-HY was expressed. the changes were slight and further investigations are required to elucidate whether SIRT1 might directly deacetylate Tax. the impact of tax acetylation on LTR activation has not been characterized. we compared the activity of Tax and its acetylation mutants in LTR activation. acetylation of Tax does not affect LTR activation or suppression of HTLV-1 transcription by resveratrol. endogenous SIRT1 was detected in the anti-Tax precipitate obtained from extracts of MT2, MT4 and C8166 cells. the SIRT1 band in the MT2 precipitate was less prominent, probably due to the smaller amount of Tax recovered. the indicated proteins were expressed and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Flag. hek293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids pCMV-Tag2-SIRT1 (WT or HY), pCAGEN-Flag-CREB, and pCAGEN-Tax-V5. the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with mouse anti-Flag and anti-V5. hek293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids pCAGEN-Flag-CREB and pCAGEN-Tax-V5. resveratrol disrupts CREB, CRTC1 and p300 recruitment to HTLV-1 LTR. CREB, CRTC1 and p300 were bound to the LTR in MT2 cells. recruitment of CREB, CRTC1 and p300 to the LTR was compromised. resveratrol represses HTLV-1 transcription by restricting LTR occupancy. *** indicates a P value of 0.00040 between lanes 2 and 3 or a P value of 0.00033 between lanes 2 and 4. in panel B, \u201c***\u201d indicates a P value of 0.0097 between lanes 2 and 3 or a P value of 0.0047 between lanes 2 and 4. DISCUSSION In this study, we obtained the first evidence for SIRT1 suppression of HTLV-1 gene expression. acetylation of Tax has previously been shown to modulate NF-B activation and oncogenic transformation. resveratrol is therefore highly specific to HTLV-1 LTR. it is intriguing to see exactly how SIRT1 impedes the interaction of tax. the use of resveratrol might be more feasible when tax expression is high in HTLV-1 carriers, TSP patients, and a small subset of ATL patients. resveratrol has already been sold as a nutritional supplement and might prove useful in many other diseases, including various types of cancer (17, 24). resveratrol has been tested in humanized mouse models of HTLV-1 infection. a large panel of small-molecule activators of SIRT1 has already been tested in clinical trials."}
