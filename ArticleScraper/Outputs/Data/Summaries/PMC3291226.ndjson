{"summary": "the study sample comprised 589 children 5 years of age. they were admitted to a pediatric unit of the university hospital of Montpellier. they were 306 boys and 283 girls with a median age of 7 months. samples were tested for respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescence assays. amplification was performed on 10 L nucleic acid extract with 0.5 mol/L both primers and probe and 3 mmol/L MgCl2 with FastStart DNA Hybridization Mix. dilution of the pGEM-T HBoV NP1 plasmid was determined by dilutions of the plasmid. seven HBoV isolates (corresponding to 1 isolate per month) were selected for sequence analysis of a 1-kb DNA fragment encompassing the VP2 gene. the nucleotide sequences were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed to include the 2 previously deposited HBoV sequences ST1 and ST2. the nucleotide sequences were aligned with the ClustalW software. the default transition to transversion ratio of 2.0 was retained. the 26 children with HBoV had a median age of 13 months. HBoV was detected in 4.4% among children 5 years of age hospitalized with a community-acquired respiratory tract infection. this 4.4% incidence is in accordance with the values of 3.1%, 5.6%, and 5.7% reported by Sloots. HBoV was detected from December to June, suggesting an epidemiologic difference with respiratory viruses such as RSV, HMPV, or influenza A virus. the absence of HBoV circulation during summer and early fall needs further confirmation. this finding might be in part explained by the low number of samples collected during this period."}
