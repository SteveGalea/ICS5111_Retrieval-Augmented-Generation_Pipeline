{"summary": "canine parvovirus (CPV) is a small nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus. CPV is a small nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus. CPV can also bind to TfR at the apical region of TfR extracellular domains. CPV and iron-loaded transferrin can bind to TfR. virus infection is mediated by virus-receptor interaction. antiviral drugs have been developed based on blocking virus-receptor interaction. recombinant sTfR possessed significant anti-CPV activity. results showed that the recombinant sTfR possessed significant anti-CPV activity. the recombinant sTfR possessed significant anti-CPV activity. anti-CPV VP2 polyclonal antibody was prepared from a new Zealand white Rabbit immunized with recombinant VP2. pcDNA3.1-CD5 plasmids containing human CD5 signal peptide were constructed as previously described. the wild-type and codon-optimized sTfR genes were subcloned into pcDNA3.1A-CD5 vector to construct their eukaryotic secretory expression vectors. transfection and expression The transfections in HEK293T cells were performed using modified calcium phosphate transfection method. electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane by using semidry electroblotting apparatus. mouse anti-His-tag antibody followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. sTfR binding activity was indicated by OD. the feline kidney F81 cells were cultured in DMEM complete medium. when cells reached 95% of confluence, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into a 96-well plate at the density of 104 cells/well. all dogs in group 2 (8 dogs) were treated with sTfR at 24 h after virus challenge. the dogs in group 1 and group 2 were continuously treated with sTfR at 10 mg/kg/day doses. at the 10 days after challenge, the morbidity and mortality rates of infected dogs were calculated. dog experiments were performed according to the guide of Beijing Municipality on the review of Welfare and Ethics of Laboratory Animals approved by the Beijing Municipality Administration Office of Laboratory Animals. anti-CPV VP2 polyclonal antibody was prepared from a new Zealand white Rabbit immunized with recombinant VP2. the wild-type and codon-optimized sTfR genes were subcloned into pcDNA3.1A-CD5 vector to construct their eukaryotic secretory expression vectors. transfections in HEK293T cells were performed using modified calcium phosphate transfection method. the protein concentrations were determined using Bradford method. the protein sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 10% (w/v) gels. the proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. goat anti-mouse IgG-AP (1 : 1000) was used for detection of the adsorbed sTfR fused with His-tag. the sTfR binding activity was indicated by OD values. sTfR antiviral activity in vivo was evaluated by the reduction of dog morbidity and mortality rates. eight dogs in group 1 were preinjected intravenously with sTfR (20 mg/kg) at 24 h before virus challenge. the dogs in group 2 (8 dogs) were continuously treated with sTfR at 10 mg/kg/day doses. wild-type and codon-optimized sTfR gene expression vectors were constructed using pcDNA3.1A-CD5-sTfRw/His and pcDNA3.1A-CD5-sTfRopt/His. sTfR genes were driven by CMV promoter and fused with human CD5 leader sequence at the N-terminus and His-tag at the C-terminus. either wild-type or codon-optimized, were transfected into HEK293T cells with calcium phosphate transfection method. at 48 h posttransfection, the culture medium was harvested and the recombinant sTfR was purified by Ni-NTA agarose and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. about 90 kDa protein bands were detected either by SDS-PAGE or Western blot. recombinant sTfR can bind to CPV and VP2 in a dose-dependent manner. two 96-well plates were coated with VP2 (1 g/mL) and CPV (1 105 TCID50/mL) rabbit anti-VP2 polyclonal antibodies were added at different amount (1, 2, 5, 10 g/mL) for antibody blocking test. the mouse anti-His antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG-AP were used for detection of the bound sTfR fused with His-tag. sTfR-incubated or BSA-incubated (as a control) CPV was added to the well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. unbound viruses were removed by extensive washing with DMEM. cells were continuously cultured until CPE occurred. sTfR decreases Mortality Rates of CPV-infected dogs. the dogs were divided into three groups. group 1 was treated with sTfR before CPV challenge. group 2 was treated with sTfR after CPV challenge. CPV + sTfR indicates the control without sTfR treatment. to prepare biologically active sTfR, the eukaryotic cell line, HEK293T cells were used. first the wild-type sTfR gene (encoding amino acid sequence: G1W2C3K4 N679E680F681) was amplified by RT-PCR. sTfR vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells with pcDNA3.1A-CD5 empty vector as a negative control. at 48 h posttransfection, the culture medium was harvested and the recombinant sTfR was purified by Ni-NTA agarose. the expression level of codon-optimized sTfR gene (3.7 0.21 g/106 cells) was 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type gene (1.2 0.12 g/106 cells), indicating that codon optimization could significantly increase sTfR expression in eukaryotic cells. two 96-well plates were coated with VP2 (1 g/mL) (a) and CPV (1 105 TCID50/mL) (b) the different amounts of sTfR (5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.63, 0.31, and 0.16 g/mL) were added for each well (BSA as a negative control) sTfR was incubated with same volume of 10 g/mL sTfR or 10 g/mL BSA (control) CPV was added to the well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. unbound viruses were removed by extensive washing with DMEM. 81 cells treated with sTfR/CPV/BSA were significantly reduced. the CPV titer in sTfR/CPV-infected cells was significantly reduced. the degree of virus reduction is proportional to the dosages of sTfR. fR-pretreated dogs were lower than that of sTfR-posttreated dogs. sTfR tends to inhibit CPV infection in vivo. sTfR has the potential protective effect for CPV control. recombinant sTfR was unable to effectively bind to VP2 and CPV. the resulting sTfR was unable to effectively bind to VP2 and CPV. bacterial cytoplasm is a reducing condition that is not favorable for disulfide bound formation. recombinant receptor can bind both virus and natural ligand. the recombinant sTfR bind to CPV but also to transferrin, a natural ligand."}
