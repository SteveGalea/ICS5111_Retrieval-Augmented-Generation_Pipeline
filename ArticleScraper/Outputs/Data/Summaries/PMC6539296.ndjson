{"summary": "the inside of the cell is beneficial for the parasite, not only because of the nutrient-rich condition, but also because it helps the parasite escape the host adaptive immune responses. pathogens have evolved to protect themselves from these cellular responses, such as some intracellular pathogens developing the ability to build a kind of nest. flaviviruses include mosquito-borne ssRNA(+) viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), west Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and tick-borne TBEV. the virus invades host cells via endocytosis and releases its positive-sense RNA genome into the cytoplasm. NS proteins are membrane-integrated proteins and do not have any known enzymatic activities. they are involved in the formation of virus replication organelles [3,6]. the newly synthesized viral genomic RNA interacts with the capsid and buds into the ER lumen with prM and E as immature virus particles. these virus particles are then released from the cells via the conventional secretion pathway and undergo the maturation steps in the Golgi and endosomes. at 48 h post-infection, JEV infected Vero cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B; red) and anti-double stranded RNA (dsRNA; Green) antibodies. nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). viruses may have developed the ability to create the mini-nuclei structures in order to concentrate materials required for genome replication. the convoluted membrane (CM) appears in infected cells at sites proximal to the vesicle packets. a yeast strain that is deficient for PI-4-P synthesis shows a defect in the early secretory pathway at the level of the Golgi apparatus [21,22] PI-4-P is believed to coordinate protein functions at the Golgi apparatus, which indicates that the protein transport machinery from the ER to the Golgi apparatus may be involved in the formation of virus replication organelles. membrane subdomains that normally function in the secretory pathway may be a common platform for replication organelle biogenesis induced by several different ssRNA(+) viruses. the expression of NS4B of HCV or NS2A, NS4A, or NS4B of flaviviruses induces a membranous web, a structure similar to that seen in virus-infected cells [31,32,33]. s, RTN3A, has been identified as a host factor that interacts to the viral transmembrane protein 2C of EV71. depletion of RTN3A inhibits EV71 replication. this suggests that the formation of membrane curvatures by RTN3A might be involved in the process of replication organelle biogenesis. ESCRT proteins were initially identified as factors involved in the transport of the vacuolar proteases. TBSV is a virus of the Tombusvirus family, which has a positive-sense single-stranded linear RNA genome. ESCRT proteins were initially identified as factors involved in the transport of the vacuolar proteases. ESCRT-0 complex recognizes the cargo signals and recruits its downstream ESCRT-I complex from the cytosol to the endosomal membrane. ESCRT-III proteins form circular arrays like a contracting ring on the inside of the budding neck. ESCRT-III proteins are disassembled and disassociate from the membrane via the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. ESCRT-0 (Hse1p), ESCRT-II (Vps36p) or one of the ESCRT-III subunits (Vps60p) did not significantly affect BMV genome replication. flavivirus genome-replication and VP formation were not significantly affected by the co-depletion of all CHMP4 family proteins. osomes are considered ER-derived organelles and are involved in the bulk degradation system in which double-membrane structures sequester cytoplasmic contents for delivery to lysosomes. nucleation of PI-3-P-enriched ER subdomains and recruitment of a series of Autophagy related gene complexes are critical for the initiation of autophagosome formation [48,53]. osome induces autophagy-like vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells. in mice that lack the ATG5 gene, CVB3 propagation in pancreatic acinar cells is significantly decreased and pancreatic pathology greatly diminished. autophagy formation was induced during the initial stage of virus infection. however, autophagy flux was blocked by the inhibition of lysosomal fusion during the later stage of infection. this suggests that the requirement of the autophagy machinery can be switched during the progression of viral replication. the ER is the site for the folding of membrane and secreted proteins. disturbing this process may cause ER stress and activate a series of signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) the ER is the cellular platform for the biogenesis of various types of organelles. flavivirus and other ssRNA (+) viruses utilize the flexibility of the ER for their efficient replication by generating specific organelles. the viruses recruit specific host factors that usually have a role in forming specialized subdomains within the ER. sorted into coat protein complex II vesicles and released via the conventional secretion pathway. autophagosomes or EDEMosomes have been proposed to be involved in the formation of the ssRNA(+) replication compartment."}
