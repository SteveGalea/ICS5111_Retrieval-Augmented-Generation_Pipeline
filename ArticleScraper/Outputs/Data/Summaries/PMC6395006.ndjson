{"summary": "a rodent mammarenavirus, Wnzhu virus (WENV) and related viruses have been reported in china, Cambodia, and Thailand. a total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. mammarenavirus particles are spherical to pleomorphic in shape and range from 40 to 300 nm in diameter. the virus particle carries a variable number of ribosomes (20\u201325 nm) from host cells that are responsible for their sandy, or arena-like appearance under electron microscopy. each genomic RNA encodes two different proteins in opposite orientations. the mammarenavirus genus is divided into the two main groups corresponding to Old and New World viruses. LASV causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) with a mortality rate of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year in west africa[19, 20], while Junn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus, Saba virus, and Guanarito virus cause fatal hemorrhagic fever diseases. there are more than 88 rodent species belonging to eight families in Yunnan Province [34]. it is essential to study the distribution of mammarenaviruses in Yunnan Province to understand its genetic evolution. PCR was performed in a 25 l reaction mix using the SuperScript III/ Platinum Taq Enzyme Mix and 3 l of RNA as a template. resultsant amplicons were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. bands of the expected sizes were gel purified and directly sequenced. ent mammarenavirus were amplified by nested-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. genome 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were amplified using the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, USA) each PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA) 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was tested using the nested RT-PCR. the NP gene was amplified and cloned into a pET expression plasmid fused with a C-terminal His tag. sections (5 mm) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were placed onto positively charged glass slides and air dried for 30 min. sections were deparaffinized, rinsed, and incubated with target retrieval solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) RNA extraction and virus detection Animal tissues were thawed and viral RNA extracted from approximately 0.1 g of tissue using the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Germany) a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using degenerate primers targeting the conserved RdRp regions. positive samples were characterized by a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed the cycle threshold (Ct) within 36 cycles. Specimens with a Ct >36 were considered negative. each run included three viral positive template controls and two negative controls. recombination events with strong p value were further confirmed in Simplot 3.5.1 [36]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining methods from MEGA 7 [37]. Virus isolation was conducted using canine macrophage cell DH82 and VeroE6 as described previously. cells were inoculated with viral RNA positive samples after a 10-fold dilution. rodent serum samples were diluted (1:100) and the peroxidase conjugated Affinipure Goat Anti Mouse (H+L) used as secondary antibody. the human coronavirus NL63 N was used as parallel control. samples were fixed in 10% formalin for 36 h. oriental house rat samples, 1/12 (8.33%) Himalayan field rat (R. nitidus) samples, and 1/10 (10%) Northern tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) samples. PCR detection results for Arenavirus in small mammals collected in Yunnan Province during 2015 to 2017. 0/8 M. pahari Indochinese Shrewlike Mouse Xiangyun(1; 2015), Yuanmou(2; 2015\u20132016), Lianghe(1; 2016), Yiliang(13; 2016. 0/10 Niviventer N. eha Smoke-bellied rat Lushui(6; 2015) the 41 partial viral sequences share 85\u2013100% similarity with each other. the isolated viral sequences share 86\u201391% similarity with each other. the phylogenetic tree shows that the viruses detected in Yunnan province form an independent lineage that is divided into two branches. the neighbor-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 7 software. all S segments contained two ORFs which encoded an NP of 568 amino acids and a GPC of 92 amino acids, either side of a 62 nucleotide non-coding region. nucleotide and deduced ORF amino acid sequences from the five isolates were compared to those of representative mammarenaviruses.
