{"summary": "selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects. in vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells. HCA7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 g ml1 kanamycin. HT29 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 1.5 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, penicillin 100 U ml1 and streptomycin 100 g ml1. cDNA was synthesised using the Custom SuperScript ds-cDNA synthesis kit. samples from various time points were pooled and underwent in vitro transcription using the ENZO IVT kit. cDNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase. FITC\u2013Annexin V apoptosis assay HCA7 cells were grown on glass chamber slides and treated with SC236 (5 M) or vehicle control for 24 h. slides were air-dried, fixed (methanol) and permeabilised (cold acetone). FITC\u2013Annexin V/propidium iodide labelling was performed using a TACS Annexin V\u2013FITC Apoptosis detection kit. cells were re-suspended in a 100 l working stock of binding buffer, propidium iodide and Annexin V\u2013FITC conjugate and incubated in the dark for 15 min. populations of both mock- and positively transfected cells were subsequently treated with either SC236 (5 M), staurosporine (1 M) or vehicle control for 24 h. adherent and floating cells were then pelleted, washed and then re-suspended in 250 l of PBS with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-ADD; Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 20 g ml1. HT29 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) and maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 1.5 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, penicillin 100 U ml1 and streptomycin 100 g ml1. RNA quality was determined by agarose gel analysis and RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. total RNA was isolated from HCA7 cells treated for 4, 6 and 8 h with SC236 (5 M) or vehicle. cDNA was synthesised using the custom superscript ds-cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) FITC\u2013Annexin V apoptosis assay HCA7 cells were grown on glass chamber slides and treated with SC236 (5 M) or vehicle control for 24 h. slides were air-dried, fixed (methanol) and permeabilised (cold acetone) cells were detached using Versene for 5 min at 37\u00b0C and adherent cells were pelleted and washed in a solution of 2% BSA suspended in PBS. cells were re-suspended in binding buffer, propidium iodide and Annexin V\u2013FITC conjugate and incubated in the dark for 15 min. populations of both mock- and positively transfected cells were subsequently treated with either SC236 (5 M), staurosporine (1 M) or vehicle control for 24 h. adherent and floating cells were then pelleted, washed and then re-suspended in 250 l of PBS with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-ADD; Molecular Probes) t-test, ANOVA and correlation statistics were performed using Pearson's test. results COX-2 modulates susceptibility to apoptosis in a human CRC cell line. FITC\u2013Annexin V (x axis, FL1) and propidium iodide (y axis, FL3) in HCA7 cells treated for 24 h with vehicle control (top), SC236 (5 M, middle) and SC236 (5 M)/PGE2 (1 M, bottom) correspondence analysis (CoA) of RMA-based measures highlighted significant global differences in gene expression between control and treated samples. this technique represents expression (hybridisation) as points projected in three-dimensional space and demonstrates a consistent alteration in the transcriptome of cells treated with COX-2 inhibition. expression of DRAK2 in HCA7 cells is regulated by COX-2 and PGE2 Differential DRAK2 expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on template from HCA7 cells. a 4.4-fold induction of DRAK2 expression was observed with SC236 (5 M) after 4 h (P=0.001), suggesting that changes in DRAK2 expression were dependant on variations in prostaglandin generation. the levels of COX-2 transcript (normalised to 18S rRNA) were elevated in the majority of tumour samples relative to normal mucosa. DRAK2 expression showed an opposite pattern, with relative suppression of DRAK2 expression in tumour compared to normal from the same patient. negative correlation between the ratio of DRAK2 and COX-2 expression (in tumour relative to normal) was noted. five patients with newly diagnosed CRC (not taking aspirin or NSAIDS) were recruited to a pilot study. the study was conducted before the withdrawal of rofecoxib by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR demonstrated an induction in DRAK2 expression. DRAK2 silencing by RNAi enhances cell survival with COX-2 inhibition. we suspected DRAK2 expression was already suppressed in HCA7 cells. HT-29 cells showed lower levels of COX-2 with higher levels of DRAK2 expression. values shown are the means.e.m. (n=3); P-values, one-way ANOVA. apoptosis was quantified by fluorescence labelling with FITC-conjugated antibody to Annexin V and propidium iodide assessed by flow cytometry. the observed increase in apoptosis at low micromolar doses of SC236 was prevented by co-administration of exogenous PGE2 (1 M), whereas more marked increases in apoptosis with higher doses of SC236 were not rescued. the ability of PGE2 to promote cell survival confirmed that at low micromolar dose the effects of SC236 are largely dependant on its ability to inhibit COX-2. total RNA from cells treated with SC236 (5 M) or vehicle control for 4, 6 or 8 h was pooled and used to probe Affymetrix HGU95Av2 GeneChips. three independent biological replicates were assayed for each condition (i.e. vehicle control or COX-2 inhibitor) expression of DRAK2 (STK17) consistently showed strong induction with COX-2 inhibition. expression of DRAK2 in HCA7 cells is regulated by COX-2 and PGE2 Differential DRAK2 expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on template from HCA7 cells. expression of DRAK2 expression was observed as early as 4 h after treatment with SC236 (5 M) after 4 h. the changes in DRAK2 expression were dependant on variations in prostaglandin generation. indirect immunofluorescent staining for DRAK2 in HCA7 cells showed acorresponding increase in levels of DRAK2 protein with COX-2 inhibitor treatment. levels of COX-2 transcript (normalised to 18S rRNA) were elevated in the majority of tumour samples relative to normal mucosa. qRT-PCR showed an induction in DRAK2 expression (Figure 4A; mean 2.5-fold increase, P=0.01) in tumour from each of the patients treated with rofecoxib. a significant decrease in VEGF expression was noted, with a significant decrease in VEGF expression. this pro-angiogenic factor has previously been linked to COX-2 activity and reduced VEGF expression has been observed in animal models following treatment with rofecoxib. DRAK2 expression normalised to 18S (as measured by qRT-PCR) in template extracted from colorectal tumours. the percentage of viable cells (without 7-ADD uptake) and non-viable cells (with 7-ADD uptake) was calculated in mock-transfected HT-29 cells and in DRAK2 siRNA-transfected cells selected (gated) by GFP fluorescence. the siRNA-transfected cells showed no loss of cell viability following treatment with both SC236 and staurosporine. coxibs have anti-neoplastic properties, but their prolonged use is limited by their association with gastrointestinal side effects. the new-generation coxibs have also shown promise for chemo-prevention of CRC but are now considered by many to carry an unacceptable risk of thrombotic events. some of the important effects of PGE2 are probably related to its ability to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor through a number of distinct mechanisms. we made use of HDONAs to identify \u2018early\u2019 target genes downstream of COX-2. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of expression data selected a cluster of genes showing a similar pattern of upregulation with COX-2 inhibition. this cluster of genes have either known nuclear localisation within the cell or have a bipartite nuclear localisation signal. many of these are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation or in the induction or potentiation of apoptosis. this protein is an important negative regulator of T-cell activation. it raises the threshold for activation through the T-cell receptor. it is clear that DRAK2-mediated cell death is cell-type and context dependent. there is a growing body of evidence to indicate that its function is directly related to the regulation of cell survival. DRAK2 forms part of a cluster of genes showing similar cyclical changes in expression with cell-cycle periodicity in HeLa cells. there is an interesting degree of overlap between this panel and COX-2-regulated genes identified by our gene expression analysis. one of the most consistent observations about COX-2 is its contribution in vivo to the risk of systemic metastases.
