{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease (BRD) has a major impact on feedlot industry in north America (1\u20133) veterinarians and animal owners are faced with challenges of accurate and timely diagnosis of ill and dying cattle to implement intervention strategies to control or minimize BRD. a growing number of private laboratories offer a variety of tests. the veterinarian may need tests by the diagnostic laboratory to provide prevention and control recommendations. it is important to address infection versus disease issue. the best diagnostic test may vary according to the question asked. Organism ID + lesion = proves disease (may be clinical or subclinical) there are instances in which evidence of infection is identified without concurrent disease manifestations. PPV is the ratio of the number of test positives to the number of true positive tests. prevalence Prevalence is the number of cases present in a population at a given time (21) this is opposed to the often-misused term, incidence, which is a measure of the risk of developing disease. antigen capture ELISA (ACE) for BVDV antigen detection. the ELISA results provide a functional indication of antibody efficacy against the virus. antibodies may bind portions of the virion that are not essential for viral invasion of host cells. Viral isolation (VI) tests by diagnostic laboratories have used the attempt to grow virus in cell cultures from diagnostic samples. the VI tests use susceptible cell cultures for inoculation and incubation periods. evidence of virus replication may be observed visually under the microscope as cytopathic effects (CP) nasal, nasopharyngeal, transtracheal, and bronchoalveolar samples can be used to determine the cause of pneumonia in a living animal. if multiple bacteria grow on the plate, the selection and identification of the one responsible for pneumonia can be missed by an inexperienced technician. if multiple bacteria grow, the selection and identification of the one responsible for pneumonia can be missed by an inexperienced technician. bacterial isolates from nasal and tracheal samples from cattle were compared. only 70% of samples were similar, indicating multiple strains of individual bacterial species are carried in the respiratory tract of cattle. immunohistochemistry (IHC) has become a much-used diagnostic tool in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. it is used when infected tissues embedded in paraffin are available as starter material (22) the potential use of IHC for identification of viruses in cells obtained from bovine BAL has been demonstrated. otide primers can be produced and used for testing. if a new molecular diagnostic test is published, the originating laboratory should be used. one of the most common uses of molecular technology is for identification of bacterial genera, species, and subspecies. multiplex PCR tests have been attempted for veterinary medicine. veterinary diagnostic laboratories are now offering the multiplex PCR for bovine infectious agents including BRD agents. quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) amplification will begin sooner in specimens containing a higher infectious agent nucleic acid load compared to a specimen with a lower infectious agent load. qPCR protocols are set for 40 cycles, which yield in theory, a trillion amplicons. in-situ hybridization is a relatively simple molecular probe assay that measures direct binding of a complementary nucleic acid probe to the nucleic acid of an infectious agent within a tissue specimen (26). the complementary probe is labeled with fluorescein or an enzyme for detection purposes and is a molecular-based counterpart to the FA and IHC tests. serology is best used to monitor for active infections in a group of cattle. there are published studies where there were seroconversions to BVDV, PI3V, BRSV, and/or bovine coronavirus (BCV) in animals without clinical signs of BRD. there were clinically ill animals seroconverting to these agents. adage: \"You only find what you are looking for\" applies to PCR and other nucleic acid-based tests (32). Molecular tests identify nucleic acid sequences specific for the agent. a positive result may indicate either infectious or noninfectious material. a positive nucleic acid-based test equates in all instances to the detection of infectious virus. a case in point is reflected in a recent paper on bluetongue virus (BTV) resistance to some antimicrobials may be subsequently tested using molecular probes for certain resistance genes. a microarray was used to test E. coli DNA for several tetracycline resistance and -lactamase genes (28). antimicrobial resistance, however, is not always linked to 1 specific gene. the availability of more tests complicates the diagnostic process. there are differences in professional opinions among diagnosticians and clinicians as to the etiologic agent when infectious material is not isolated or agent specific lesions are not observed, yet a molecular test is positive. some of these are in progress, or at least archived tissues need to be examined. there are instances in which evidence of infection is identified without concurrent disease manifestations. this can still be of diagnostic significance because of their regulatory significance. seroconversion is production of increased antibodies capable of binding the antigen in a defined assay system (20) Sensitivity Sensitivity is used to rule out a disease (21) if the specificity of disease is 100%, then all animals without disease test negative. if the animal tests positive, it has the disease and can be ruled in for the disease. negative predictive values are more intuitive than sensitivity and specificity. specificity Specificity is used to rule in a disease (21) if the specificity of disease is 100%, then all of the animals without disease test negative. if the animal tests positive, it has the disease and can be ruled in for the disease. negative predictive value (PPV) answers the question, \"if an animal tests positive, does it have disease\" reactions to the different Ig subclasses (IgM, IgA, and IgG) can be determined using appropriate reagents. sometimes serum dilutions are made and endpoint ELISA titers are reported. anti-leukotoxin ELISA only measures binding of antibodies to all parts of the molecule. a downside to VI in cell cultures is that 2 passages are used, taking at least 2 wk before a test is called negative. samples from nasal, nasopharyngeal, transtracheal, and bronchoalveolar samples are prepared for EM. a trained technician must select colonies that appear similar to those known to be from pathogenic bacteria. this selection is only as good as the technician doing the selection. all bovine respiratory bacterial pathogens can be members of the normal upper respiratory flora. identification of one or more of those bacteria does not necessarily indicate that an organism is the cause of the disease or lesion. the direct FA test has been widely used by veterinary diagnostic laboratories since the days of hog cholera control programs. most BRD viruses may be identified in tissues by FA testing. the accuracy of the IHC test depends on the specificity of the monoclonal antibody or hyperimmune serum for the infectious agent. the limitation to this test is often the lack of reactive monoclonal antibodies to selected agents. users should consult with their laboratory for available tests and the interpretation of test results. conventional PCR detection A known genetic region is amplified in a thermocycler using polymerase to produce an amplified segment of nucleic acid. those products are then compared to known positive controls using gel electrophoresis or sequenced and compared to published sequence for the specific agent. for RNA viruses, a reverse transcriptase enzyme reaction is required. multiplex PCR test for BHV-1, BVDV, and PI-3 viruses was described (27) veterinary diagnostic laboratories are now offering the multiplex PCR for bovine infectious agents including BRD agents. in-situ hybridization is a relatively simple molecular probe assay. it measures direct binding of a complementary nucleic acid probe to the nucleic acid of an infectious agent within a tissue specimen. the pathologist can visualize whether they are associated with foci of inflammation, within macrophages or other lesion components. serology Laboratories providing antibody assays have mainly focused on viruses. the term seroconversion for VNT is indicated when there is a 4-fold increase in VNT titers between the acute and convalescent sera. ELISA complement fixation tests (CF) and/or agglutination tests. testing for shipment of semen, fertilized ova, and animals for international movement requires special testing. toxin-neutralization assays can be used for certain bacteria that secrete toxins. virus replication may be observed visually under the microscope as cytopathic effects (CP) not all viruses show cytopathology, such as noncytopathic BVDV, and other detection methods are used to confirm virus presence such as antigen detection by fluorescent antibody, ELISA, or immunohistochemistry (IHC). if no CP or antigen is detected, a second incubation is used. nasal, nasopharyngeal, transtracheal, and bronchoalveolar samples can provide data that can be helpful for the clinician. if multiple bacteria grow on the plate, the selection and identification of the one responsible for pneumonia can be missed by an inexperienced technician. if multiple bacteria grow on the plate, the selection and identification of the one responsible for pneumonia can be missed by an inexperienced technician. M. haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis were isolated from deep nasopharyngeal swabs collected prior to euthanasia and from the lungs collected by lung lavage or from tissue samples at necropsy. there was 86% correlation between upper and lower respiratory isolates of M. haemolytica and 100% correlation for M. bovis isolates. this study only represents isolates from 10 calves. the sections are deparaffinized, hydrolyzed, digested with proteinase. the sections are then reacted with an-immunoglobulin-specific antiserum. the enzyme reacts with a color substrate and the localized color reaction identifies the antigen in the tissue section. this permits detection of antigen within a lesion or within specific cells by light microscopy. two web sites have comprehensive lists of molecular tests available to veterinarians. one of the most common uses of molecular technology in microbiology is for identification of bacterial genera, species and subspecies as well as viral genotyping. multiplex PCR tests have been attempted for veterinary medicine. many veterinary diagnostic laboratories are now offering the multiplex PCR for bovine infectious agents including BRD agents. qPCR protocols are set for 40 cycles, which yield in theory a trillion amplicons. qPCR protocols are set for 40 cycles, which yield a trillion amplicons. the lower the Ct the more infectious agent. in-situ hybridization is potentially more sensitive and can identify low numbers of copies of the infectious agent nucleic acid. serology is best used to monitor for active infections in a group of cattle, rather than specific disease in a single animal. there were clinically ill animals seroconverting to these agents. some may try to equate magnitude of antibody levels as means to differentiate vaccine-induced antibodies from those naturally induced. but there are studies, using BVDV antibody levels, where this concept was not confirmed. the adage, \"You only find what you are looking for\" applies to PCR and other nucleic acid-based tests (32). Molecular tests identify nucleic acid sequences specific for the agent. a positive result may indicate either infectious or noninfectious material. a reader questioned the authors of an article in which a specific test for mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis detected the bacterial DNA in 81% of drinking water sampled by PCR. the authors logically attacked the use of that assay under conditions for which it has not been validated and argued strongly that the results of the manuscript under attack do not make biological sense. lungs were examined for H. somni from 65 cases of BRD pneumonia using conventional and molecular tests. the bacterium was cultured from 10 cases, identified by IHC in 17, and found by in-situ hybridization in 19 cases. studies need to be performed using known experimental challenge experiments and a complete battery of tests available including VI, FA, IHC, and PCR. serology is best used to monitor for active infections in a group of cattle, rather than specific disease in a single animal. an animal with active immunity induced by an MLV BVDV vaccine may have a high response upon exposure to a persistently infected BVDV animal (10,31) practitioners may want to know what is the \u201cprotective titer\u201d that a vaccine must induce. but under experimental conditions, a protective titer may be determined for a specific vaccine and pathogen. the design of PCR probes may target sequences that are highly conserved among a broad based agent such as viral family, genus, or species. a positive nucleic acid-based test equates in all instances to the detection of infectious virus. a reader questioned the authors of an article in which a specific test for mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis detected the bacterial DNA in 81% of drinking water sampled by PCR. authors logically attacked the use of that assay under conditions for which it has not been validated and argued strongly that the results of the manuscript under attack do not make biological sense. authors recommended PCR should be considered for use as a supplemental tool for diagnosis of specific pathogens in bovine lungs. but they acknowledged that direct culture, IHC and in-situ hybridization can be more readily interpretable with respect to cause and effect of a specific pathogen in BRD. molecular diagnostic tests have outpaced validation, standardization, and standards for interpretation relative to their use in BRD diagnostics. each veterinarian upon receipt of molecular test results should ask the question, \"Does the result make biologic sense\""}
