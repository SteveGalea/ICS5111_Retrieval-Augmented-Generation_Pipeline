{"summary": "the world has already witnessed this in almost every influenza outbreak [1,2,3,4], as well as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the years 2002\u20132003 [5,6]. Vaccination is still the most efficacious method of preventing viral infections; however, this is still a challenge for many viruses. nucleic acid-based therapeutics are broadly comprised of the DNA-based therapeutics and the RNA-based therapeutics. these molecules offer sequence-specific cleavage of transcripts and have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to downregulate disease-causing genes either through RNA interference or catalytic cleavage. short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) work by degrading the mRNA of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences. the siRNAs interfere with the expression of specific target genes with complementary nucleotide sequences, thus inhibiting their expression [22] and preventing translation. dsRNA gets cleaved into the short siRNA molecule which gets bound by a multiprotein component complex referred to as RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) one of the siRNA strands then guides and aligns the RISC complex on the target mRNA. the dicer recruited Argonaute protein (which is also an RNase) slices the target mRNA thus causing gene suppression and consequent decrease in protein levels. antiviral drugs currently approved to treat influenza include the Adamantanes (M2 ion-channel protein inhibitors) and the neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir [42] few viral strains have been found to be resistant to these drugs [43,44,45], thus emphasizing the need for urgent development of new antiviral drugs. administration of siRNAs using lipid carrier to influenza-infected mice by hydrodynamic injection and intranasally has efficiently saved animals against highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. studies have also targeted the NS1 gene of influenza A virus and demonstrated a significant decrease in viral replication in experimental mice [51]. siRNA against viral phosphoprotein (P protein) was given intranasally to mice. the antiviral activity of the siRNA on the animal model was comparable to that in cell culture. if properly designed, low dosages of inhaled siRNA might prove effective antiviral treatment against respiratory viral infections in humans. placebo group treated with ALN-RSV01 had significantly lower number of RSV infections. reduced acquisition of the viral infection was observed within 3\u20134 days after virus inoculation. the ALN-RSV01 also entered phase II b clinical trial in the RSV-infected lung transplant patients. pSR02 and pSR03 had similar antiviral effect against the ORF 1b sequence. the inhibitory effect of the siRNA designed against the virus was remarkable. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have been used for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. the ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. after cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes were designed to cleave the viral RNA-segment 5 of influenza A virus. the ribozymes were engineered as therapeutic agent to recognize conserve regions of the influenza virus sequences and catalytically cleave the corresponding viral mRNA targets. in another study, the Influenza virus PB1 gene was targeted by Rz directed to cleave the PB1 mRNA. both the designed siRNA and hammerhead Rz were directed to cleave the M1 RNA of influenza A virus. the selectively disabled mutant constructs were far less effective [52] chimeric-ribozyme constructs showed a >80% protection against the virus challenge. deoxyribozymes (Dz) are synthetic catalytic single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid molecules that display precise substrate recognition and have the ability to cleave sequence-specific mRNA molecules with greater biological stability. the best characterized one is still the RNA-cleaving DNAzymes. the 8\u201317 Dz cleaves between A and G nucleotides and requires a rG\u2013dT wobble pair in the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. the DNAzyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA\u2013DNAzyme complex. after cleaving the RNA target, the DNAzyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. hammerhead ribozymes (Rz) have been constructed to cleave the conserved domains of the influenza virus M1 RNA as an antiviral strategy to reduce the infectiousness of the virus. a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study showed that both Dz and Rz can inhibit replication of the virus individually with a substantial decrease (54%) in virus replication when used simultaneously. 10 wild RSV strains isolated from patients showed significant suppression by Dzn1133 with higher anti-RSV activity than that for ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) treatment with Dzn1133 reduced viral plaque formation in the lungs of RSV-infected mice. antisense oligonucleotides are small synthetic pieces of single-stranded DNA that are normally 15\u201330 nucleotides in length. the use of ASOs was first reported by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 as a potential antiviral therapeutics. antisense oligonucleotides have been studied extensively against respiratory viruses with promising results. oligos could effectively suppress the influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus production in cell lines. PPMOs selectively target translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3\u2032-terminal region of NP viral RNA to prevent virus replication in MDCK cells. another study by duan et al. used novel antisense oligonucleotide (IV-AS) specifically designed against the 5\u2032-terminal conserved sequence found in all the eight viral RNA segments of influenza A virus. cytopathic effect caused by A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2), and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) strains of IAV for almost 48 h post-infection. the same AS molecule protected mice against all the strains of influenza virus in vitro. antisense oligonucleotides target the internal regions of influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) viral RNA segment 8. 10 of the 14 designed and tested ASOs showed significant inhibition of viral replication in MDCK cells. the combinations of ASOs slightly improved anti-influenza activity. both PPMOs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when tested for anti-RSV activity in two human-airway cell lines. one PPMO (AUG-2), reduced the viral titers by >2.0 log10 in lung tissue at day 5 post-infection, and further reduced pulmonary inflammation at day 7 post-infection. aptamers are 20\u201390 nucleotides long, synthetic single strand nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA) they are designed to bind to various organic or nonorganic molecules. they are generated by the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method. more than 40 RNA aptamers have been constructed against recombinant hemagglutinins (H1, H3, H5, H9, and HA from influenza virus B) and whole viruses (H5N1) [116] have been constructed. RNA aptamer P30-10-16 was found to be 15 times more specific to H3N2 of influenza A than to any conventional anti-HA monoclonal antibody. aptamers have been developed against influenza for therapeutics purposes. many aptamers could prevent the entry of the virus to the cells by blocking hemagglutinin activity. aptamers targeting host cell factors important for viral replication have also been studied. a specific aptamer effectively blocks the replication of influenza and other viruses in infected cells through IFN/ immune responses. ssDNA aptamer proficiently detects N protein by Western blot. short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) work by degrading the mRNA of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences. the siRNAs interfere with the expression of specific target genes with complementary nucleotide sequences, thus inhibiting their expression. dsRNA gets cleaved into the short siRNA molecule which gets bound by a multiprotein component complex referred to as RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) one of the siRNA strands guides and aligns the RISC complex on the target mRNA thus causing gene suppression and consequent decrease in protein levels. the highly specific cleaving ability of the siRNAs makes them a potent prophylactic and therapeutic treatment option in targeting the disease-causing genes antiviral drugs currently approved to treat influenza include the Adamantanes (M2 ion-channel protein inhibitors) and the neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir [42] few viral strains have now been found to be resistant to these drugs [43,44,45]. administration of siRNAs using lipid carrier to influenza-infected mice by hydrodynamic injection and intranasally has efficiently saved animals against highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. studies have also targeted the NS1 gene of influenza A virus and demonstrated a significant decrease in viral replication in experimental mice. siRNA against viral phosphoprotein (P protein) was given intranasally to mice. antiviral activity of the siRNA on the animal model was comparable to that in cell culture. if properly designed, low dosages of inhaled siRNA might prove effective. compared to the placebo group, the subjects treated with ALN-RSV01 had a significantly lower number of RSV infections. reduced acquisition of the viral infection was observed within 3\u20134 days after virus inoculation. the ALN-RSV01 also entered phase II b clinical trial in the RSV-infected lung transplant patients [65] pSR02 and pSR03 had similar antiviral effect against the ORF 1b sequence. the inhibitory effect of the synthetic siRNA designed against the virus was remarkable. the hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have catalytic activity just like the DNAzymes. the ribozyme cleaves the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids. the ribozyme has a 22-nt-long conserved catalytic core that targets RNA with NUX sequence. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes were designed to cleave the viral RNA-segment 5 of influenza A virus. the ribozymes were engineered as therapeutic agent to recognize conserve regions of the influenza virus sequences and catalytically cleave the corresponding viral mRNA targets. in another study, the Influenza virus PB1 gene was targeted by Rz directed to cleave the PB1 mRNA. designed siRNA and hammerhead Rz were directed to cleave the M1 RNA of influenza virus. chimeric construct demonstrated a >80% protection against the virus challenge. the selectively disabled mutant constructs were far less effective. short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) siRNAs are typically 21\u201323 long double-stranded RNA segments that interfere with the expression of specific target genes with complementary nucleotide sequences. the host enzyme Dicer binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cleaves it into short pieces of 20 nt called siRNA. the mRNA is then cleaved by the nuclease activity of the RISC dsRNA gets cleaved into the short siRNA molecule which gets bound by a multiprotein component complex referred to as RISC. one of the siRNA strands then guides and aligns the RISC complex on the target mRNA. the dicer recruited Argonaute protein slices the target mRNA thus causing gene suppression and consequent decrease in protein levels. antiviral drugs currently approved to treat influenza include the Adamantanes (M2 ion-channel protein inhibitors) and the neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir [42] few viral strains have now been found to be resistant to these drugs [43,44,45].

treatment against respiratory viral infections in humans. reduced acquisition of the viral infection was observed within 3\u20134 days after virus inoculation and continued till the end of the study. the ALN-RSV01 also entered phase II b clinical trial in the RSV-infected lung transplant patients [65]. safety and efficacy of the drug is yet to be disclosed for the highly susceptible pediatric population. pSR02 and pSR03 had similar antiviral effect against the ORF 1b sequence. the inhibitory effect of the synthetic siRNA designed against the virus was remarkable. adenoviruses are also known to cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have been used for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. the ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. after cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes designed to cleave viral RNA-segment 5 of influenza A virus. hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes were engineered as therapeutic agent to recognize conserve regions of the influenza virus sequences and catalytically cleave the corresponding viral mRNA targets. hammerhead Rz was better than the hairpin Rz. both the designed siRNA and hammerhead Rz were directed to cleave the M1 RNA of influenza virus. the chimeric construct demonstrated a >80% protection against the virus challenge. however, the selectively disabled mutant constructs were far less effective. DNA therapeutics against Respiratory Viruses DNA was first isolated 150 years ago. the only function attributed to DNA was to carry and pass genetic information from one generation to another. however, with advancements in science, DNA molecules got recognition for having new role in the field of materials science. the 8\u201317 Dz cleaves between A and G nucleotides and requires a rG\u2013dT wobble pair in the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. the DNAzyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA\u2013DNAzyme complex. after cleaving the RNA target, the DNAzyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. hammerhead ribozymes (Rz) have been constructed to cleave the conserved domains of the influenza virus M1 RNA as an antiviral strategy to reduce the infectiousness of the virus. a real-time polymerase chain reaction study showed both Dz and Rz can inhibit replication of the virus individually with a substantial decrease (54%) in virus replication when used simultaneously. 10 wild RSV strains (including both subgroups A and B) isolated from patients showed significant suppression by DZn1133 with higher anti-RSV activity than that for ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) treatment with Dzn1133 reduced viral plaque formation in the lungs of RSV-infected mice. antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are small synthetic pieces of single-stranded DNA that are normally 15\u201330 nucleotides in length. the use of ASOs was first reported by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 as a potential antiviral therapeutics. se H (RNAse H) or RNase P mediated cleavage of mRNA or (ii) by sterically (non-bonding) blocking enzymes that are involved in the target gene translation. oligos could effectively suppress the influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus production in cell lines. e-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) to selectively target the translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3\u2032-terminal region of NP viral RNA to prevent virus replication in MDCK cells. another study by duan et al. used a novel antisense oligonucleotide (IV-AS) specifically designed against the 5\u2032-terminal conserved sequence found in phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (S-ONs) obtained from packaging signals in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the PB2 vRNA against influenza virus in vitro. the 15-mer S-ON (designated 5\u201315b) derived from the 5\u2032 end of the PB2 vRNA proved noticeably inhibitory. oligodeoxyribonucleotides target the internal regions of influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) viral RNA segment 8. 10 of the 14 designed and tested ASOs showed significant inhibition of viral replication in MDCK cells. both PPMOs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when tested for anti-RSV activity in two human-airway cell lines. one PPMO (AUG-2), reduced the viral titers by >2.0 log10 in lung tissue at day 5 post-infection and further reduced pulmonary inflammation at day 7 post-infection. a highly conserved RNA sequence on the programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting (1 PRF) is used by eukaryotic RNA viruses. cells transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon showed a significant suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV [114]. the 8\u201317 Dz cleaves between A and G nucleotides and require a rG\u2013dT wobble pair in the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. the DNAzyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA\u2013DNAzyme complex. after cleaving the RNA target, the DNAzyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. novel Dz and hammerhead ribozymes (Rz) have been constructed to cleave the conserved domains of the influenza virus M1 RNA as an antiviral strategy to reduce the infectiousness of the virus. a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study showed both Dz and Rz can inhibit replication of the virus individually with a substantial decrease (54%) in virus replication when used simultaneously. both subgroups A and B isolated from patients showed significant suppression by DZn1133 with higher anti-RSV activity than that for ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-carboxamide) treatment with Dzn1133 reduced viral plaque formation in the lungs of RSV-infected BALB/c mice. antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are small pieces of single-stranded DNA that are normally 15\u201330 nucleotides in length. they inhibit translational processes either by inducing cleavage mechanisms or by inhibiting mRNA maturation. antisense oligonucleotides have been studied extensively against respiratory viruses. the earliest studies using oligos to inhibit synthesis of virus-specific proteins, including influenza, were reported in the 1990s. PPMOs selectively target translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3\u2032-terminal region of NP viral RNA to prevent virus replication in MDCK cells. study also used primer extension assays to show that treatment with any of the effective PPMO markedly reduced the levels of mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA. orn/307/72 (H3N2), and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) strains of IAV for almost 48 h post-infection. the same AS molecule protected mice against all the strains of influenza virus in vitro. the same AS molecule protected mice against all the strains of influenza virus. the designed ASOs were 11\u201315 nucleotides long and showed varying inhibition ranging from 5- to 25-fold. the combinations of ASOs slightly improved anti-influenza activity. oligodeoxyribonucleotides inhibited virus antigen production. both PPMOs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when tested for anti-RSV activity in two human-airway cell lines. one PPMO reduced the viral titers by >2.0 log10 in lung tissue at day 5 post-infection, and further reduced pulmonary inflammation at day 7 post-infection. aptamers are 20\u201390 nucleotides long, synthetic single strand nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA) they are designed to bind to various organic or nonorganic molecules. they are generated by the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method. more than 40 RNA aptamers have been constructed against recombinant hemagglutinins (H1, H3, H5, H9, and HA from influenza virus B) and whole viruses (H5N1) [116] have been constructed. RNA aptamer P30-10-16 was found to be 15 times more specific to H3N2 of influenza A than to any conventional anti-HA monoclonal antibody. aptamers have been developed against influenza for therapeutics purposes. many of these aptamers could prevent the entry of the virus to the cells by blocking hemagglutinin activity which could be measured in vitro using hemagglutination inhibition assay. 11 aptamers which inhibit viral protein\u2013host translation factor interactions have been useful against influenza. aptamers to most common subunits of the virus are being developed. aptamers to most common subunits of the virus are being used to develop sensors for influenza detection. in case of influenza, at least 18 different HA antigens have been identified. more than 40 DNA and RNA aptamers against recombinant hemagglutinins (H1, H3, H5, H9, and HA from influenza virus B) and whole viruses (H5N1) have been constructed. the aptasensor and the same sensitivity as the QCM aptasensor were used to detect H5Nx viruses. the aptamer-based sensor increased many folds when the secondary aptamer was conjugated with gold nanoparticles. these chemical modifications of aptamers reduce selection time and increase biostability in vivo. few aptamers targeting host cell factors important for viral replication have also been studied. a specific RIG-I aptamer effectively blocks the replication of influenza and other viruses in infected cells through IFN/ immune responses. major challenges in in vivo delivery of nucleic acids include immunogenicity, enzymatic digestion in body fluids, phagocytosis by the immune cells, and renal clearance. intracellular challenges to the delivery of these molecules include endosomal and lysosomal escape. siRNA was delivered through intranasal route prior to infection, either naked or in complex with transfection reagent viz. TransIT-TKO reagent, could significantly reduce the viral titer and disease outcome in mice. however, again the effect of siRNA was very low when delivered after virus infection. administration of siRNA-D5W solution complex targeted to spike coding gene and NSP12 region of SARS coronavirus (SCV) genome showed efficient inhibition of SCV replication and suppression of SARS like symptoms in monkey model. intranasal inoculation of chitosan complexed with plasmid encoding shRNA targeted to NS1 gene of RSV could reduce RSV infection and lung pathology in rat model. recombinant baculovirus vector could exhibit transient but effective expression of shRNA targeted to influenza A and B virus under in vitro condition. the possibility of innate immune response induced by siRNAs/shRNAs or its delivery vehicles is another obstacle that needs to be addressed very carefully.
