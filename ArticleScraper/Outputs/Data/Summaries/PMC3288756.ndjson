{"summary": "background Accumulated evidence suggest specific patterns of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and their crosstalks may determine transcriptional outcomes. the regulatory mechanisms of these \"histone codes\" in plants remain unknown. the levels of H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K23ac and H3K27ac are altered in the coding regions of drought stress-responsive genes. it has been proposed that nuclear proteins can read the histone code via their PHD finger domain in HeLaS3 cells. the PHD fingers of the alfin-like proteins in A. thaliana can bind to histone H3K4me3/2. expression of the alfalfa Aflin1 and Alfin1-like genes are induced under salinity stress. a recent investigation demonstrated that PHD homolog proteins in soybean are localized in the nuclei. anti-GmPHD5 antibodies could recognize a protein with a molecular weight 35 kD from soybean protein extracts. pre-immunization sera were used as negative controls. molecular weight of GmPHD5 detected was slightly larger than expected value (28 kD), which could be attributed to post-translational modifications. methylated histone H3K4 was also confirmed in these co-precipitated histone H3. methylated histone H3K4 was also confirmed in these co-precipitated histone H3. western blotting with anti-methylated H3K4 revealed that histone H3 was successfully pulled down by GST-PHD5. the identities of two non-histone proteins were successfully determined to be elongin A and GNAT. the cDNA of both genes were subsequently cloned into the MBP vector to generate fusion proteins (Figure 4A) both MBP-GNAT1 and MBP-elongin A fusion proteins were pulled down by antibodies against GST-PHD5. acetylation in the extracted soybean histone H3 increased when treated with GmGNAT1 in vitro. acetylation at histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 18 did not change much. however, no obvious acetylation signals were observed for GmPHD5. in vitro acetyltransferase assay indicated that GmGNAT1 acetylated histone H3 (A) acetylation of GmGNAT1 inhibited its interaction with GmPHD5 (E) GST pull down assay indicated that GmISWI interacted with GmPHD5 through its N termini (B) the solubilized soybean nuclear proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GmPHD5 antibody, rabbit IgG and beads. all proteind were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE separation. GmPHD5 located on the promoter and coding region of some salinity stress inducible genes Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using the anti-GmPHD5 antibody and the soybean chromatin. we detected the interaction between GmPHD5 and two salinity inducible genes. a very small amount of GmPHD5 located in the body of actin. we obtained the full length coding region of GmPHD5 (see Materials and Methods) which encompasses 756 bp and encodes a protein composed of 251 amino acids. the molecular weight of the recombinant GmPHD5 was found to be 28 kD as expected (see Additional File 2, Figure S2) the expression patterns of GmPHD5 in soybean were studied by western blotting. the GmPHD5 protein was found to be ubiquitously expressed in both leaves and roots. Western blotting showed that methylated H3K4 was present in the histone H3 pulled down by the GmPHD5 in the GST pull down assay (B). methylated H3K4 was present in the histone H3K4 pulled down by the GmPHD5 in the GST pull down assay (B) silver staining gel of GST-PHD5 pulled down proteins. protein 1 and 2 identified as GmGNAT and GmElongin A by mass spectrometry. mElongin A by GST pull down assay. Arrowheads pointed to the expressed protein MBP (upper) and MBP GNAT1 (lower) acetylation in the extracted soybean histone H3 increased when treated with GmGNAT1 in vitro. acetylation at histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 18 increased significantly after treatment with GmGNAT1. GmGNAT1 self-acetylation inhibited its interaction with GmPHD5 (E) acetylation of GmGNAT1 would impair its interaction with GmPHD5 (E) the solubilized soybean nuclear proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GmPHD5 antibody, rabbit IgG and beads, respectively, followed by immunodetection using anti-GmISWI antibody (C). all proteind were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE separation. GmPHD5 was found to bind to the promoter regions of both genes. for GmRD22, GmPHD5 also bound to its gene region near the 5' end. GmPHD5 was not uniformly distributed in the genome. there are six homologues of PHD5 in soybean and their responses to abiotic stresses, such as salinity, cold and drought stress, are different. this work showed that GmPHD5 may adopt a similar mechanism as the ING (INhibitor of Growth) family members by recruiting nuclear protein complexes to conduct the physiological functions. GmPHD5 can distinguish the subtle difference of all methylation states on H3K4. the yeast GNAT selectively transfers an acetyl group to K14 of histone H3 and to K8 and K16 of histone H4 [20]. our work provides evidence to show that GmPHD5 could recruit GmElongin A [26]. it is reported that the Elongin complex is a heterotrimer composed of A, B, and C subunits. the subunit A has a function in activating transcription, suggesting that GmElongin may play similar roles. 'histone code' H3K4me2 is recognized by the salinity stress inducible PHD (plant homeodomain) finger domain containing protein GmPHD5, which is found on both the promoter and coding regions of salinity inducible genes. this regulatory complex could recruit gene expression cofactors, including the chromatin remodeling factor GmISWI, and gene transcriptional elongation factor GmElongin A. gene specific primers for making cloning and the details of PCR settings were given in Additional File 9, Table S3. a BamHI (GGATCC) and a SalI site were added to the 5'-ends of forward and reverse primers. the PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels, purified, digested with specific restriction enzymes. mmol/L to induce the expression of the recombinant proteins at 25\u00b0C. the bacteria were collected, suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 1 mg/ml lysosome. the supernatant was stored at -80\u00b0C until use. antigen emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant (Sigma, Missouri, USA; Product number: F-5881) (1:1) three times in two-week intervals. all rabbits were raised in the animal centre of The Chinese University of Hong Kong according to animal ethics. the GST-PHD5 fusion protein was incubated with GST agarose beads at room temperature for 30 min. the beads were washed 10 times with wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl), 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. each column washed twice with buffer containing 25 mM Tris co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and peptide pull down assays were carried out using specific antibodies raised against the targeted proteins. western blotting was followed as described [32] using anti-MBP antibody. biotin conjugated peptides containing H3K9 trimethylation were used as the control. the beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer at 99\u00b0C for 10 min. western blotting was followed using anti-GST antibody. lysates were sonicated to shear genome DNA to lengths between 200-1000 bp. supernatants were then diluted 10 fold with ChIP dilution buffer. bead/antibody/protein/DNA complexes were washed with low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer and TE buffer sequentially. to reverse the protein-DNA crosslinks, 5 M NaCl was applied to the eluted samples to a final concentration of 200 mM. the total DNA was finally recovered from the samples by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. mM PMSF, 1 mM protease inhibitor, incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C. protein acetylation was determined by western blotting with anti-acetyl-K antibody. cDNA samples for molecular cloning were reverse-transcribed. transformed bacteria were inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 g/ml of ampicillin and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2.5-3 h.
