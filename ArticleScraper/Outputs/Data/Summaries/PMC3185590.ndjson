{"summary": "viruses have been isolated, characterized, identified and studied from animals, plants, protists, bacteria and even other viruses. the challenge has been to define and study a miniscule \u201cbeing\u201d with the appropriate tools. a first approach to studying an unknown virus is to know exactly its identity, and to place it into context of other related and non-related viruses. adenovirus, influenza, norovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, arbovirus and paramyxovirus were recently analyzed in such a format allowing for a global examination. development of next generation DNA sequencing technology is providing an additional impetus, given \u201cfaster, cheaper\u201d and hopefully higher quality data. large data sets of related viral genomes from a family are just being assembled. many of these data sets have been recently assembled and reported. a special issue is to provide a sampling of the virus families that have been and are of importance. the pathogen responsible for a novel highly contagious respiratory disease in Hong Kong (2002\u20132003), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as a SARS-related coronavirus by a microarray assay that made use of unique genome signature sequences. a possible origin for this emergent pathogen is presented by Woo et al., using molecular clock analysis to show that the most recent common ancestor of human/civet SARS-related corono a genome-based paradigm has been implemented in the papillomaviruses (PV) since 2004. a genome-based algorithm has already been implemented in the papillomaviruses (PV) since 2004 [8]. there are currently 55 human adenovirus types accepted by peer review. mRNA transcripts often yield multiple spliced products. software tools, such as automated annotation, developed for non-virus genomes may not be transferable directly to the analysis of virus genomes. coregenes is an \u201con-the-fly\u201d web-accessible software tool designed originally (2002) to survey a group of viruses for determining a core set of genes. recently it has been upgraded to provide features desired for the display of an in silico proteome used for reclassifying the bacteriophage genomes. the 3rd Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Workshop was held on 26\u201327 April 2010. there are 27,091 full-length virus genomes deposited in GenBank as of 2010. a significant increase of viral genomes is expected in the very near future. large data sets of related viral genomes from a family are just being assembled. many of these data sets have been recently assembled and reported. a special issue is to provide a sampling and a range of the virus families. report on coronavirus illustrates the importance of viral genomics and bioinformatics in monitoring and identifying global pathogens rapidly and effectively. the pathogen responsible for a novel highly contagious respiratory disease in Hong Kong (2002\u20132003), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as a SARS-related coronavirus by a microarray assay that made use of unique genome signature sequences. the hexon-specific loop 1 epitope represents only 2.6% of the genome sequence. a genome-based paradigm has already been implemented in the papillomaviruses (PV) since 2004. the papillomaviruses (PV) is one of the most widely accepted adenovirus types. genomes differ from other organism genomes in complexity, despite their generally smaller sizes and presumed \u201csimplicity\u201d. mRNA transcripts often yield multiple spliced products. mRNA transcripts often yield multiple spliced products. a pan-genome comprises a \u201ccore\u201d set and a \u201cdispensable\u201d set of genes. the dispensable set presumably allows a unique strain to occupy a specific niche. coreGenes is an \u201con-the-fly\u201d web-accessible software tool designed originally (2002). the genomes provide unique sequence signatures that may be used to populate microarray chips for surveillance and diagnostics [11,14] or to develop specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. a different application is realized in using these approaches to understand in greater detail the viruses that are used in biomedical and biotechnological processes. a significant increase of viral genomes is expected in the near future. international research allows for the deposit of these sequences into one or more public databases. international research allows for the deposit of these sequences into one or more public databases."}
