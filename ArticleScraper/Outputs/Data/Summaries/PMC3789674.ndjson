{"summary": "in 2002-03 a previously unknown coronavirus emerged from a wild animal reservoir to cause the SARS pandemic. in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, another novel human coV, now called MERS-CoV, was isolated in vero E6 cells from sputum from a fatal case of severe to moderate respiratory disease. since then, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in over 70 patients with severe to moderate respiratory disease, 39 of whom have died the 200 kDa spike glycoprotein (S) of coronaviruses is an important determinant of virus virulence, tissue tropism and host range. trimers of S form the characteristic large spikes on the coronavirus envelope that bind to receptors, mediate membrane fusion, virus entry and syncytia formation, and elicit virus neutralizing antibodies. protein with c-terminal 16 amino acids substituted with a linker and FLAG tag. Lanes 1 and 5, control pseudovirions with no spike; lanes 2 and 6, MERS pseudovirions; lanes 3 and 7, lysate of 293T cells producing MERS pseudovirions. is virus (MHV) [23], a betacoronavirus in group a; aminopeptidase N (APN) for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and several other alphacoronaviruses [24,25]; and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for both SARS-CoV, a betacoronavirus in group b and hCoV-NL63, an alphacoronavirus no protease cleavage products of the 200kDa S protein were detected in transfected 293T cells or pseudovirions. lentivirus pseudovirions used to identify cells susceptible to entry of MERS-CoV in the Poehlmann laboratory [33] contained high proportion of cleaved MERS-CoV S protein at about 100 kDa. cell entry was quantitated by expression of the luciferase reporter gene in pseudovirus-transduced cells. compared to control pseudovirions with no spike protein, MERS pseudovirions showed a 100 to 1,000 fold increase in luciferase activity in vero E6 and LLCMK2 cells. related human CEACAM proteins or human APN functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV spike protein. these experiments confirm the observation that MERS-CoV does not use the receptor proteins known for other coronaviruses or related human membrane proteins. in vero E6 cells, 20mM NH4Cl inhibited entry of SARS pseudovirions by about 99.9% compared to entry of SARS pseudovirions without inhibitor. NH4Cl also inhibited entry of MERS pseudovirions by about 99.6% compared to entry of SARS pseudovirions without inhibitor. bafilomycin A inhibited entry of SARS pseudovirions into vero E6 cells by 99.8% as previously reported [21,38] and also inhibited entry of MERS pseudovirions by more than 99.9% compared to MERS pseudovirions without inhibitor. NH4Cl reduced MERS-CoV S-mediated entry only 6-fold. cleavage of MERS-CoV S protein by one of the cathepsins or calpain was required for triggering S-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry at low pH in endosomes. in vero E6 cells 10 M of cathepsin L inhibitor III significantly inhibited entry mediated by SARS S protein. cathepsin L inhibitor III reduced entry into vero E6 cells of pseudovirions with uncleaved S by 97% relative to MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4\u00b0C to cell surface receptors on vero E6 cells in the presence of 20mM NH4Cl. then the cells with bound virions were briefly treated with trypsin at room temperature to cleave the 200 kDa S protein. however, trypsin treatment of the MERS pseudovirions bound at neutral pH and 4\u00b0C to the vero E6 cell membrane triggered both virus trypsin cleavage of MERS-CoV S protein expressed on the cell surface induces syncytia formation in vero E6 cells 293T cells expressing uncleaved MERS-CoV S protein or control cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector were overlaid on monolayers of vero E6 cells in the presence or absence of TPCK trypsin. large syncytia formed after 20 minute trypsin pre-treatment at pH 7.4 and 4\u00b0C of 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S protein. trypsin cleavage at neutral pH of MERS-CoV S protein on 293T cells triggered syncytia formation when S was bound to receptors on susceptible Vero E6 cells. the MERS pseudovirions produced in 293T cells expressing TMPRSS-2 or -4 contained little or no immunoreactive S protein or fragments of S. in contrast, without TMPRSS-2 or -4, the 293T cells expressing uncleaved MERS-CoV S16 did not form syncytia. but virus entry was inhibited by NH4Cl. codon-optimized spike cDNA encoding S of MERS-CoV [15], with the 16 C-terminal amino acids replaced by a linker, GGGGS, and a FLAG tag (here called MERS-CoV S16) only the upper S band was incorporated into MERS pseudovirions (Figure 1B, lane 2). soluble, truncated MERS S proteins were detected. AO4 antibody did not recognize the S1 domain of MERS S. cross-reactivity between these proteins from betacoronavirus groups a and c must lie within the S2 domain. ase activity by nearly 100-fold compared to the no spike control virus. expression of human ACE2 in 293T cells did not significantly increase susceptibility to MERS pseudovirions. neither human CEACAM1 or four related human CEACAM proteins or human APN functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV spike protein. entry of MERS-CoV (red) or no spike control (white) pseudovirions into different cell lines: 293T, NIH3T3, NIH3T3/Vector (transfected with empty vector), bat EFF (embryo cells from Eptesicus fuscus), and bat TB1Lu (lung cells from Tadarida brasiliensis). entry of MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein required endocytosis. NH4Cl inhibited entry of SARS pseudovirions by about 99.9%. bafilomycin A specifically inhibits the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase required for acidification of lysosomes. cleavage of MERS-CoV S protein by one of the cathepsins or calpain was required for triggering S-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry at low pH in endosomes. cleavage of MERS-CoV S protein by one of the cathepsins or calpain was required for triggering S-mediated membrane fusion. trypsin treatment at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C cleaved the S protein of MERS pseudovirions and generated a 65kDa subunit in the S2 domain of the protein recognized by antibody to MHV-A59 S protein. however, trypsin treatment of the MERS pseudovirions bound at neutral pH and 4\u00b0C to the vero E6 cell membrane triggered both virus entry at the plasma membrane and formation of small syncytia by 40 hours trypsin-cleaved MERS-CoV S protein allows pseudovirions to enter at endosomes. syncytia formation required expression on the vero E6 cells of the MERS-CoV receptor. surface induces syncytia formation in vero E6 cells 293T cells expressing uncleaved MERS-CoV S protein. no syncytia formation was induced by 293T cells with empty vector or 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S16 without trypsin. syncytia were formed after even a brief 20 minute trypsin pre-treatment at pH 7.4 and 4\u00b0C of 293T cells we therefore transfected 293T cells with plasmids encoding TMPRSS-2 or -4, MERS-CoV S16 protein, psPAX2 and pLenti-GFP-Luc. we investigated whether S proteins on pseudovirions produced in these cells were cleaved and if they could infect Vero E6 cells in the presence or absence of NH4Cl. lentivirus pseudovirions were inoculated onto vero E6 cells in presence of 20mM NH4Cl. elucidating the functions of the spike glycoprotein can provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. the ability of MERS-CoV to infect cells from multiple mammalian species directly and without adaptation suggests that the receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4 [28] is broadly conserved among many species. it will be important to learn whether these new world bats are susceptible to MERS-CoV or related group c betacoronaviruses. cross-reacting epitopes in S2 could account for observed serological cross-reactivity. serological studies may not accurately distinguish between different phylogenetic groups of betacoronaviruses. most class I viral fusion proteins require proteolytic cleavage. virions of group b betacoronavirus SARS-CoV that contain uncleaved S [22] first bind to the viral receptor protein, ACE2, and are endocytosed. then S is cleaved within endosomal vesicles by acid-dependent cathepsin L enabling the conformational changes in S that lead to virus entry [21,22,60]. MERS pseudovirions fused with the plasma membrane and transduced the cells. Upon warming to 37\u00b0C at neutral pH, the MERS pseudovirions fused with the plasma membrane and transduced the cells. however, the acidification required for endosomal entry [33] was required to activate the protease activity of cathepsin. syncytia formed when 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S16 protein were co-cultured in the presence of trypsin with vero E6 cells that express the MERS-CoV receptor. some coronavirus S proteins can trigger receptor-independent syncytia formation. rine proteases TMPRSS-2 and -4 could activate the syncytia forming activity of MERS-CoV S16 protein expressed in 293T cells. we hypothesize that this syncytia formation may be due to RIS. pooled purified human immunoglobulin containing neutralizing antibody has been used to treat a variety of infectious diseases. however, patients infected with either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV contain virions in the lung likely have uncleaved S protein due to lung proteases. cleavage of MERS-CoV-S protein by trypsin, TMPRSS2 or -4 or cathepsin L is required to activate the membrane fusion activity of S. cleavage of MERS-CoV-S protein by trypsin, TMPRSS2 or -4 is required to activate the membrane fusion activity of S.
