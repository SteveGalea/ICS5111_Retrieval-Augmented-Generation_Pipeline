{"summary": "the total number of adults with CKD was approximately 220 million men and 270 million women [1]. the majority of the world\u2019s population lives in low- and middle-income countries. the majority of the world\u2019s population lives in low- and middle-income countries. guidelines from the national Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF/KDOQI) state that there is strong evidence to support the recommendation of lowering salt intake to 90 mmol (less than 2 g) per day of sodium. but average salt intake still exceeds 8 g per day in japan. high salt intake in obesity also plays a crucial role in the development of hypertension. childhood obesity is more prevalent in males than females, and severe obesity is associated with elevated BP. in salt-resistant hypertensive patients, there was no significant change by salt-loading in 24-h urine protein excretion [25]. reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased albuminuria are associated with poorer CKD prognosis. in early stages, symptoms of CKD are usually not apparent. the association of salt with renal injury is due to \u201cintra-renal\u201d RAS, but not circulating RAS. a basic study has demonstrated that despite a suppression of circulating angiotensin II with salt loading, locally generated \u201cintra-renal\u201d RAS was stimulated by salt and angiotensin II content of proximal tubular fluid increased. a reduction in salt intake causes a significant fall in BP in hypertensive patients. the accumulation of sodium in tissue has been presumed to be accompanied by a commensurate retention of water. a high-salt diet in rats leads to interstitial hypertonic sodium accumulation in skin, resulting in increased density and hyperplasia of the lymphcapillary network. salt intake accelerates target organ damages, leading to cardiovascular [17,18] and cerebrovascular [19] diseases. a high salt intake accelerates albuminuria [18] and a decline in glomerular filtration rate [20] in hypertensive patients. reduced glomerular filtration rate is associated with poorer CKD prognosis. excess dietary salt exerts additional non-pressure-related detrimental effects on the kidneys [29], characterized as renal hypertrophy and fibrosis [30,31] renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in their development. this is because RAS blockade prevents or ameliorates sodium-induced renal damage in salt-loaded SHR without affecting BP [29], suggesting that salt itself is associated with RAS. nephrectomy in the presence of a high-salt intake model. nephrectomy in the presence of a Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension model. association of high-salt diet with blood pressure and chronic kidney disease in Normotensive individuals. association of high-salt Diet with BP and the Kidney in Normotensive Individuals Todd et al. [42] reported that dietary salt intake did not cause significant elevation in BP in normotensive individuals. but renal parameters were not estimated such as serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance, so the effects of salt on renal function remains unknown. in general, normal individuals are acutely and chronically resistant to salt-induced hypertension. this is because normal individuals rapidly excrete salt and retain little of it. this is because normal individuals rapidly excrete salt and retain little of it, so that their blood volume does not increase. Sprague-Dawley rats, a salt-resistant strain of rats, fed high-salt diet. a high salt intake induced renal tubular injury and renal fibrosis. a high salt intake enhances renal injury due to increased oxidative stress. anti-oxidative enzymes such as super oxidative dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) showed a significant decrease [59], suggesting that ROS could induce apoptosis. urinary vanin-1 and NGAL are earlier biomakers of salt-induced renal tubular damage compared to urinary Kim-1 both in SHR and WKY. urinary vanin-1 and NGAL could be useful for the detection of salt-induced renal injury in both hypertensives and normotensives. a high salt intake enhances renal injury due to increased oxidative stress in hypertensive [53] rats. it has been reported that the small GTPase Rac 1 is activated by elevated sodium [55], and the Rac1 inhibitor decreased sodium-induced superoxide generation [56]. a relatively high level of ROS causes redox imbalance, leading to the induction of cell apoptosis or necrosis under various physiological and pathological conditions. urinary vanin-1 and NGAL are earlier biomakers of salt-induced renal tubular damage compared to urinary Kim-1 both in SHR and WKY. urinary vanin-1 and NGAL could be useful for the detection of salt-induced renal injury in both hypertensives and normotensives. in-1 could be a predictor of kidney damage. pathological changes of renal cortical sections in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats after 8%-salt loading for eight weeks."}
