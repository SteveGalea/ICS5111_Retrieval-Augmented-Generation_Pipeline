{"summary": "the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \u2014 which causes AIDS \u2014 has been the subject of intense studies since the early 1980s. estimates reveal that by the end of 2010 more than 30 million people were living with the infection worldwide. the data were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) [24], [25], a federal government's institution which performs a national census about every ten years. the data are also attached to our paper in Table S1. a chronological evolution of the AIDS cases per year is available as (Figure S1) the infection is concentrated in some key cities located mainly next the Atlantic littoral, where is concentrated most of the Brazilian population. the radius of the circles are proportional to the logarithm of the absolute frequency yi,t. the solid line is a linear fit (in log-log scale) giving a power law exponent. the green points correspond to the numerical solution of the continuous equation with for the Gompertz model. figure 2B shows the correspondent accumulated annual absolute frequency defined mathematically as. for small times, exhibits an exponential growth, where has the unity. the limit can be recovered from Equation (1) when is very small. a power law decaying in the form (2) with (99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval; 99% confidence interval. a power law pattern could not be identified [37]. the error bars correspond to 99% bootstrapped confidence intervals. this result indicates that the distribution of the set of yi,t has a robust long-tailed behavior. similar power laws can also be identified for all the yi,t with t fixed. the solid lines have slopes (a) 1.37 and (b) 1.31. the annual absolute frequency of AIDS cases depends on the population with a non-trivial rule, since. the more populous the city, the greater the density of the infection per capita. Brazil is a forefront reference in providing AIDS prevention campaigns and treatment services. the country has been investing systematically for years. only in 2008, Brazilian government invested more than US$ 600 million in HIV domestic and international spending. estimates suggest that more than 1.2 million of life-years are estimated to have been gained in Brazil between 1996 and 2009 [14]. their impact over the frequency of new infection cases is evident in cities of the groups III and IV since the end of the 1990s. the radius of the circles are proportional to the logarithm of the absolute frequency yi,t. the axis represent the dependence of the distribution of the AIDS cases on the geographic position (latitude and longitude) of the cities. the solid line is a linear fit (in log-log scale) giving a power law exponent. the green points correspond to the numerical solution of the continuous equation with for the Gompertz model, connecting the fit of Equation (1) to the patterns of the data. for small times, exhibits an exponential growth, where has the unity. a numerical comparison with the data reveals a relative error of 0.8 (for the logistic model) or of 0.5 (for the Gompertz model) for small times. data are a small fraction of the population and have severe limitations in time and space, which does not happen with the Brazilian data. probability density function (PDF) of the annual absolute frequency of AIDS among Brazilian cities. the annual evolution of the power law exponent with 99% bootstrapped confidence intervals is shown in Figure 3B. for the year 2012, the values for were obtained by a maximum-likelihood estimation. the actual number of infected individuals per capita depends on many different factors. the solid lines have slopes (a) 1.37 and (b) 1.31. the annual absolute frequency of AIDS cases depends on the population with a non-trivial rule, since. similar allometric scaling laws have been identified in many biological systems. to quantify such impact, we split all the Brazilian cities with at least one AIDS case since 1989 into 4 groups accordingly to their average absolute frequency per year. group II encompasses 565 cities with 2yi,t10, and group IV covers 48 cities with yi,t>84. yi,t has a well-defined allometry with the population of cities. the total of 5138 cities are split in 4 groups: yi,t2 (Group I), 2yi,t10 (Group II), 10yi,t84 (Group III) and yi,t>84 (Group IV) the total of 5138 cities are split in 4 groups: yi,t2 (Group I), 2yi,t10 (Group II), 10yi,t84 (Group III), and yi,t>84 (Group IV). for the AIDS epidemics in brazil, we found that this exponential provides the parameter (inset of Figure 2B) which are in good agreement with the growth of AIDS in some Europeans countries [36] for small time scales (typically smaller than the characteristic time for infection-related deaths) the prevalence of an infection can be associated to the whole number of infected individuals. centers with an average of more than 10 AIDS cases per year (Groups III and IV) that is, the infection is not expected to grow uncontrollably in such cities; in particular, it is expected to lose its strength in the largest urban centers (average of more than 84 AIDS cases per year). on the other hand, the average number of new infections per year (as well as their fluctuations) in cities of groups I and II are still growing."}
