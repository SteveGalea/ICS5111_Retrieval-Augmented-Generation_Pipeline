{"summary": "SARS-CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales order. it is the largest RNA virus (positive stranded) with a genome size of around 30 kb. the viral genes encoded by all coronaviruses, as well as their gene organization, are all similar. studies indicated either M and N or M and E are sufficient for the formation and release of VLPs. in viral envelope, M protein laterally interacts with the other two transmembrane proteins E and S. inhibition on M gene expression might be a good strategy for anti-SARS drug development. the results of current study may provide valuable information for the design of more effective siRNA against the M gene of SARS-CoV. we compared the M genes derived from 15 isolates of SARS-CoV. previously, a number of M gene siRNAs based on random selection have been reported. we chose two unexplored regions that were well conserved in the M genes among the 15 isolates of SARS-CoV. one targeting site was +221+242nt and the other at +466+486nt relative to the 5\u2019 ATG initiation codon. two novel siRNAs effectively inhibits M gene expression. the reaction products were probed with anti-Myc antibody. 1g of either pEGFP-M or pEGFP was co-transfected with increased doses of si-M1 or si-IL17RE. si-M2 which targeted at the 3\u2019 half of M gene also dramatically inhibited M mRNAs by about 78 fold when the molar ratio of si-M2:M was increased to 8:1. si-M2 but not si-IL-17RE effectively inhibited pEGFP-M gene expression. about 1 g of pEGFP-M plasmid was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-M2 or si-IL17RE. higher doses of si-M2 but not si-IL17RE effectively inhibited EGFP-M gene expression. silencing in SARS M gene expression might work in a sequence-dependent manner. 2 g of M gene was co-transfected with 4 g of each plasmid pBS/U6. co-transfection of 2 g of each pCMV-Myc plus 4 g of pBS/U6 was served as negative control. about 1 g of total RNA isolated from each reaction was subjected to RT-PCR analysis using either IFN or -actin primers. the selection of targeted sites for M gene specific siRNAs SARS-CoV is a positive stranded RNA virus with higher mutation rates. previously, a number of M gene siRNAs based on random selection have been reported. we chose two unexplored regions that were well conserved in the M genes among the 15 isolates of SARS-CoV. one targeting site was +221+242nt and the other was +466+486nt relative to the 5\u2019 ATG initiation codon. two novel siRNAs effectively inhibits M gene expression. the reaction products were probed with anti-Myc antibody. si-M1 specifically inhibited pEGFP-M fusion gene but not pEGFP gene expression. 1g of either pEGFP-M or pEGFP was co-transfected with increased doses of si-M1 or si-IL17RE. si-M2 which targeted at the 3\u2019 half of M gene also dramatically inhibited M mRNAs by about 78 fold. si-M2 but not si-IL-17RE effectively inhibited pEGFP-M gene expression. about 1 g of pEGFP-M plasmid was co-transfected with increased doses of either si-M2 or si-IL17RE. higher doses of si-M2 but not si-IL-17RE effectively inhibited EGFP-M gene expression. plex mediated gene silencing in SARS M gene expression might work in a sequence-dependent manner. about 2 g of M gene was co-transfected with 4 g of each plasmid pBS/U6. co-transfection of 2 g of pCMV-Myc plus 4 g of pBS/U6 was served as negative control. g pCMV-Myc plus 4 g of pBS/U6 was served as negative control (lane 1). About 1 g of total RNA isolated from each reaction was subjected to RT-PCR analysis using either IFN or -actin primers. pCMV-Myc-M gene was amplified from viral strain HKU-39849. oligoes 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, 1a\u2032 and 1b\u2032, 2a\u2032 and 2b\u2032 were annealed pair-wisely to form duplexes. oligoes 5\u2032-aacgacaatattgcttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt pBS/U6 [21] to form pBS/U6-siM1, pBS/U6-siM2 and pBS/U6-siM3 respectively. 1 g of total RNAs was first reverse transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) transfection Cell cultured in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs using ProFection\u00ae Mammalian Transfection Systems. transfected DNAs were first mixed with 2M CaCl2 (37 L) and brought to a total volume of 300 L. after 15 minutes incubation, the reaction mixture was evenly distributed into the cell culture medium and incubated for 15 minutes. transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO4, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 M PMSF. about 15 g of cell lysate for each sample was resolved onto 12% SDS-PAGE. d with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C incubator containing 5% CO2. anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. oligoes 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, 1a\u2032 and 1b\u2032 were annealed pair-wisely to form duplexes. the duplex products were then subcloned into pBS/U6 [21] to form pBS/U6-siM1, pBS/U6-siM2 and pBS/U6-siM3 respectively. about 2 L of the transcribed cDNAs was subjected to standard PCR reaction using M gene specific primers. one-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out with iQ5 real-time PCR detection system. transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO4, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL aprotinin, and 1 M PMSF. transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl ( hek293 cells were transiently co-transfected with EGFP-M plus either si-M1 or si-M2. the contransfection of EGFP-M plus si-IL-17RE#1 was served as a negative control. the intensity of EGFP gene expression was measured using the FACSARIA flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA, USA) both si-M1 and si-M2 were able to functionally counteract the M gene-mediated INF production."}
