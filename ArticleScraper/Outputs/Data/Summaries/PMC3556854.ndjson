{"summary": "airborne pathogens present a unique challenge in infectious disease and infection control. a small percentage of infectious individuals appear to be responsible for disseminating the majority of infectious particles. aerobiology is the study of the processes involved in the movement of microorganisms in the atmosphere from one geographical location to another. airborne particles are particularly worrisome simply because they can remain airborne for as long as one week after initial aerosolization. seminal studies from 1930s and 1940s showed that airborne particles can remain airborne for as long as one week after initial aerosolization. a complicating factor is the heterogeneous nature of droplet and airborne releases. particles carrying infectious microorganisms do not exclusively disperse by airborne or droplet transmission, but by both methods simultaneously. the literature suggests that a particle's size is of central importance in determining whether it becomes and remains airborne and infectious. particle size is such an important variable in airborne and droplet disease transmission. the ability of an infectious disease to cause an infection depends on the concentration of the microorganism, the human infectious dose, and the virulence of the organism. a single sneeze generates as many as 40,000 large droplet particles. most will desiccate immediately into small, infectious droplet nuclei [17] 80% of the particles being smaller than 100 m [64] health effects associated with indoor biological air pollutants include disease, toxicoses, and hypersensitivity (i.e., allergic) diseases. exposure to indoor biological air pollutants has been associated with disease, toxicoses, and hypersensitivity (i.e., allergic) diseases. relative humidity is recognized to be a factor in the viability of airborne and droplet viral transmissions. relative humidity is recognized to be a factor in the viability of airborne and droplet viral transmissions. however, the exact relationship is not well understood. airborne fungi and their spores have been suggested to have the potential to enter a building that uses natural ventilation. more than viruses or bacteria, airborne fungi and their spores have been suggested to have the potential to enter a building that uses natural ventilation. an understanding of aerobiology, typical origins of droplet and airborne infections, and how different environmental factors affect airborne and droplet particles is critical to any discussion of the amelioration or mitigation of infectious airborne and droplet transmission. we discuss the first in the context of office buildings and the latter in the context of healthcare facilities. HVAC systems are intended to provide for the health, comfort, and safety of occupants by maintaining thermal and air quality conditions acceptable to the occupants [104, 105] HVAC systems perform multiple functions simultaneously, including controlling three known central variables in the airborne transmission of infectious particles. the introduction of airborne infectious agents into an office or commercial building varies with the microorganism. bacteria and mold species are also known to grow in places where water has collected. such infected individuals may show no symptoms and thus hamper infection control measures. the extent to which HVAC systems contribute to the airborne transmission of disease has not been quantified. healthcare facilities are subject to the same infectious challenges common to all office and commercial buildings. health leaders believe we are entering a \u201cpost-antibiotic era\u201d where once easily treated infectious diseases will become very difficult to treat. airborne infectious particles in hospitals span a wide range of sizes. they can be single bacterial cells or spores, fungal spores, or viruses. most infectious particles generated from human respiratory sources occur primarily as droplet nuclei, with a diameter of 0.5\u20135.0 m. influenza A causes disease primarily in the lungs [63] so sterile hands, instruments, and equipment cannot prevent an infectious person from transmitting, or a susceptible individual from acquiring the virus. in public areas like emergency rooms, over 50% of detectable Influenza A viral particles are aerosolized [62] hospitals currently attempt to reduce the airborne infectious disease load by (1) increasing the air changes per hour. increasing the number of air changes per hour alone does not solve the problem. even very frequent air changing (within reason) does not radically reduce the airborne infectious particle count. airborne infectious particles spread throughout a space evenly and quickly no matter the configuration. airborne infectious particles spread throughout a space evenly and quickly no matter the configuration. ASHRAE ran three computational fluid dynamic models. more than 70 clinical rooms containing patients suffering from TB were studied. a recent study investigated rates of fresh air exchange achievable by natural means in health care settings. simply opening windows and doors provided between 28 and 40 changes per hour, drastically reducing the amount of airborne infectious particles in the room. upper-room UV fixtures can be achieved without increasing the incidence of the most common side effects of accidental UV overexposure (e.g., eye and skin injury). airborne pathogens in a travel/Leisure setting An enclosed passenger cabin of a commercial airplane is an environment conducive to the airborne spread of pathogens carried by passengers or crewmembers. one air change per hour of well-mixed air in any space is thought to remove 63% of the airborne organisms in that space. ventilation on commercial aircraft helps to reduce transmission of airborne infectious particles. airborne transmission becomes widespread in passenger cabins with no ventilation. airborne pathogens in a biodefense setting are a too substantial subtopic for the present paper. the occurrence of \u201cconfirmed bioagent\u201d cases with \u201chigh value targets\u201d continues to the present [176] and appears to be increasing [176] of recent, confirmed cases, the source of the biological material was a \u201clegitimate supplier,\u201d most of the perpetrators acted alone. is currently a wide range in the reported frequencies of airborne transmission in hospital-acquired infections (10\u201333%) a better understanding of the true contribution of airborne transmission to infection rates would allow hospital administrators to determine the degree to which they should commit resources to minimize this vector of disease transmission."}
