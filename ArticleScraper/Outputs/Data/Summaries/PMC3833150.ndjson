{"summary": "enteric pathogens are a major group of organisms related to infections in humans and animals. these pathogens are resistant to adverse environmental conditions and are frequently transmitted by oral route due to fecal contamination of foods, water, vegetables and fruits. feces from all parks were inoculated aseptically in 225 mL sterilized water. 0.03 L of material was inoculated in defibrinated bovine blood agar (5%) and MacConkey agar for E. coli isolation. plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for three days and were assessed every day for bacterial growth. Colonies suggestive of Salmonella were inoculated in triple sugar iron (TSI) and lysine iron (LIA) agar slants. tubes were incubated for 35 \u00b0C for 24 h. E. coli DH5 strain was used as a negative control. primers for virulence factor genes were determined individually using template DNA from appropriate positive and negative control strains. cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 and 2), hly (-hemolysin), vt1 and vt2 (verotoxins), sta and stb (heat stable toxins), lt1 (heat labile toxins), eaec (E. coli EAEC), ipaH (E. coli EIEC), and eae, eaf and bfp (E. coli EPEC group II coronavirus specific RT-PCR assay targeted to RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene (RdRp) with a 136-bp predicted product. BCoV Kakegawa strain (Akashi et al., 1980) and PBS were used as positive and negative controls. 0.03 L of material was inoculated in defibrinated bovine blood agar (5%) and MacConkey agar for E. coli isolation. plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for three days and were assessed every day for bacterial growth. Colonies suggestive of Salmonella spp. in at least one of the culture media (TSI or LIA) were submitted to biochemical tests, agglutination test using polyvalent anti-Salmonella serum (Probac) and serotype identification. target DNA for PCR amplification was obtained by using an alkalin lysis method. reference strains were E. coli FVL2 (sfa, pap, iucD, hly, cnf-1), FV35 (afa, iucD, cnf-1), J96 (papGII, papGIII), O157:H7 (vt1, vt2, eae), 2348/69 (eae, bfp, eaf), EAEC O42 (ea toxins), lt1 (heat labile toxins), eaec (E. coli EAEC), ipaH (E. coli EIEC), and eae, eaf and bfp (E. coli EPEC) appropriate primer sequences, annealing temperature, and size of amplified fragment (base pairs - bp) were determined in previous studies. BCoV Kakegawa strain (Akashi et al., 1980) and PBS were used as positive and negative controls. p 0.05 indicates statistical differences between microorganisms. phylogenetic classification showed that the 63 E. coli isolates belonged to groups B1 (52.4%), A (25.4%) and B2 (22.2%). no E. coli serotype O157:H7 was identified. virulent strains contain a large plasmid of 85\u201390 kb, responsible for encoding the 15\u201317-kDa antigens (VapA) that are considered the major causes of suppurative pneumonia in foals. avirulent strains show no evidence of either vapA or vapB genes. the present study was the first investigation in this country about virulence profile of R. equi strains isolated from park sand. beside absence of virulent or intermediately virulent R. equi strains, presence of this microorganism in the sand constitutes a public health problem. this class of E. coli EPEC causes diarrhea in children younger than one year of age, mostly in emerging countries. atypic EPEC isolated from parks constitutes a public health risk, especially for children and immunosuppressed humans. one of our isolates harbored the genes that encode papGI, sfa and hly. virulence factors in a same isolate may be explained by the presence of a pathogenicity island (PAI), which enhances the infectivity of the microorganism. the presence of a self-agglutinating adhesin (saa) in E. coli has been previously described. saa gene was found in 19.0% of E. coli strains obtained from the sand of parks. the presence of eggs of Toxocara spp. in the sand of parks has been reported in several countries. three parks had positive samples for eggs of this parasite. these results suggest environmental contamination by feces of companion animals. despite the absence of Salmonella spp. and Rotavirus in the samples analyzed, these pathogens should be included in microbiological testing required to determine the sanitary conditions of the sand used in parks. the identification of R. equi, E. coli EPEC, bovine Coronavirus, and Toxocara spp. are indicators of fecal contamination."}
