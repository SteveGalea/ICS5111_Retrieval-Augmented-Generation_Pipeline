{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) can infect animals, including humans, avians, rodents, carnivores, chiropters and other mammals. they exhibit a high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, which may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. as of the 26th of January 2018, 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported. these cases include 750 deaths globally. rapid and accurate diagnosis is significant for the prevention of extensive MERS outbreaks. tin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex. the complex, labeled with FITC, is captured by an anti-FITC antibody. the test results are presented as a colored line that is visible to the naked eye. included 19 MERS-CoV strains, 2 SARS-CoV strains, 1 HKU4 strain, 1 HKU5 strain, and 2 SARSr-CoV strains were presented in Figure 2. A 213-nt region among the complete RNA positions 28848\u201329061 of the EMC strain was selected for submission to an online primer design software. the recombinant plasmid was synthesized using in vitro transcription by Bao Biological, Co., Ltd., Dalian, China. the recombinant plasmid concentration was 370 ng/l, which corresponded to 7.9 1010 copies/l. the recombinant plasmid was then purified and quantified. 0.1 M of LF and LB, 0.05 M of F3 and B3, 1.4 M of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.2 M of betaine and 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase were used. if the recombinant plasmid was used as the template, the mixture was heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then immediately placed on ice. RT-LAMP-VF assay Specificity and Sensitivity Evaluation Multiple respiratory pathogen nucleic acids were extracted from the NATtrolTMsp RP Multimarker Controls kit. RNA of the RP1 controls, RP2 controls, SARSr-CoV and HKU4 and synthesized RNA transcripts were used to evaluate the specificity of the RT-LAMP-VF assay. three replications were performed for each trial. the total RNA of throat swabs harvested from healthy people served as the control. three replications were performed for each trial. the conventional RT-LAMP reaction mixture and the amplification were mixed and performed under the same conditions as the RT-LAMP-VF assay. the products of the conventional RT-LAMP were analyzed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. amplicons labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex. the complex is captured by an anti-FITC antibody that is coated on the text line of the strip. the test results are presented as a colored line that is visible to the naked eye. alignment results that included 19 MERS-CoV strains, 2 SARS-CoV strains, 1 HKU4 strain, 1 HKU5 strain, and 2 SARSr-CoV strains were presented in Figure 2. A 213-nt region between the complete RNA positions 28848\u201329061 was selected for submission to an online primer design software. the 5\u2032 ends of the LF and LB primers were labeled with FITC and biotin. pretreatment of the recombinant plasmid containing the MERS-CoV N gene was measured with a spectrophotometer. the copy number of the recombinant plasmid was calculated using the following formula. reaction mixtures included 5 l of template, 8 M of MgSO4, 0.2 M of FIP and BIP, 0.1 M of LF and LB, 0.05 M of F3 and B3, 1.4 M of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase. mixture was heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then immediately placed on ice. RT-LAMP-VF assay Specificity and Sensitivity Evaluation Multiple respiratory pathogen nucleic acids were extracted from the NATtrolTMsp RP Multimarker Controls kit. RNA of the RP1 controls, RP2 controls, SARSr-CoV and HKU4 and synthesized RNA transcripts were used to evaluate the specificity of the RT-LAMP-VF assay. three replications were performed for each trial. the total RNA of throat swabs collected from healthy people was purified using a commercial RNA extraction kit. swabs harvested from healthy people served as the control. three replications were performed for each trial. rRT-PCR assay against upE and N of MERS-CoV was performed. recombinant plasmids were detected at five different temperatures for 50 min. the same results were obtained at incubation periods of 30 and 40 min. 103 102 101 100 N 30 0.2 + + + + + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - RT-LAMP-VF assay limit was 2 101 copies/l within 35 min. only the synthesized RNA transcripts tested positive, and multiple respiratory pathogen nucleic acids from RP1 and RP2, SARSr-CoV, and HKU4 all tested negative. RT-LAMP-VF assay had no cross-reactivity with multiple CoVs. the RNA of MERS-CoV was used to evaluate the RT-LAMP-VF assay. different copy numbers of viral RNA (ranging from 1 105 to 1 10-1 copies/l) were spiked into the total RNA of throat swabs collected from healthy people. ERS-CoV RNAs (1 103\u20131 10-1 copies/l) were used as the templates in conventional RT-LAMP, rRT-PCR and RT-LAMP-VF assays. the positive reaction was clearly observed for the 1 102 copies/l of MERS-CoV RNA sample using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. the limit of detection was equivalent to 1 101 copies/l of MERS-CoV RNA in the RT-L temperature/\u00b0C Recombinant plasmids dilution (2 copies/l) 107 106 105 104 103 102 101 100 N 61 + + + + + + + - - - - 63 + + + + + + + + + + - - - - 65 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + - - - - 67 + + + + + + + + + + + + the serially diluted 10-fold synthesized RNA transcripts were detected at three different times at 65\u00b0C. the amplification was performed at different concentration for each of inner primers FIP and BIP (0.2 or 0.4 M) three replications were performed for each trial. RP1 and RP2, SARSr-CoV, and HKU4 all tested negative with the RT-LAMP-VF assay. therefore, the RT-LAMP-VF assay had no cross-reactivity with multiple CoVs, including SARSr-CoV, HKU4, HKU1, OC43 and 229E. the RNA of MERS-CoV was used to evaluate the RT-LAMP-VF assay. negative results were observed when the concentration was lower than 1 101 copies/l. different copy numbers of viral RNA were spiked into the total RNA of the throat swabs collected from healthy people. the limit of detection was equivalent to 1 101 copies/l of MERS-CoV RNA in the conventional RT-LAMP-VF. both of the rRT-PCR assays could detect templates as little as 1 100 copies/l of MERS-CoV RNA for the upE or N2 gene. the field of MERS-CoV detection, Bhadra et al. (2015) established a real-time quantitative method, i.e., a one-step strand displacement RT-LAMP, which can detect 5\u201350 PFU/ml of MERS-CoV. despite the advantages of the RT-LAMP application, there are still some technical shortcomings, such as false positive problems. a study by Notomi et al. (2000) found that inserting TTTT into the FIP and BIP primers can enhance LAMP efficiency. however, the inner primers used in many studies of the detection of nucleic acids with LAMP assays do not contain TTTT sequences. the RT-LAMP-VF assay only requires 35 min, which is far faster than the rRT-PCR assay, which requires 2 h. the method does not require electronic equipment to read the signal of the amplification products. reviewer TS and handling Editor declared their shared affiliation. supplementary material can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01101/full#supplementary-material."}
