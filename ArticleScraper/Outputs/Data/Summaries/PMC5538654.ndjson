{"summary": "the causative infectious bronchitis virus (IB) belongs to the family Coronaviridae. the disease is usually characterized by high morbidity and low mortality in mature birds. mortality up to 100% can be observed in naive young birds (2\u20133 weeks of age) a nephropathogenic strain of IBV (B1648) could replicate in peripheral blood monocytes leading to viremia. the infection of circulating monocytes could disseminate IBV to the urinary tract, liver and spleen. macrophages play roles in innate immune responses, as well as in mounting adaptive immune responses by functioning as antigen presenting cells. one day old unsexed SPF layer chickens were obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa, and raised to six days of age for use in these experiments. the chickens were not immunized and were housed in high containment poultry isolators at the University of Calgary\u2019s Spyhill campus or at the Foothills campus. ten-fold serial dilutions of virus were prepared in PBS (1 Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) 100 L of the dilutions were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of eggs. the inoculated eggs were incubated at 37.2\u00b0C and relative humidity of 60% for another 6 days. macrophages (MQ-NCSU cells) were cultured on coverslips placed in 6-well plates. cells were washed twice with HBSS and infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of IBV M41 or Conn A5968 strains. each experiment was performed in triplicate including uninfected controls. cell culture supernatants derived RNA were used to quantify IBV RNA following IBV infection of macrophages. each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. culture supernatants were preserved at -80\u00b0C for quantification of NO production or type 1 IFN activity. the RNA pellet was re-suspended in 20 l of RNase-free water. the RNA concentration was quantified using the nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer at 260 nm wavelength. fast SYBR\u00ae Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) with 5 nM of each of the gene-specific primers. 200 ng of cDNA derived from each sample and RNAse-free water were used in the reaction in a final reaction volume of 20 L. thermal cycling parameters were 95\u00b0C for 20 seconds; 40 cycles of amplification/extension at 95\u00b0C for 3 seconds. Rabbit IgG (H+L) was used as the isotype control (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) before being stained for IBV, sections were blocked for endogenous avidin /biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) cell pellets were immersed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours. cells were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide buffered with cacodylate and dehydrating via an acetone gradient. macrophage culture supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of Griess assay reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% N-1-naftyletylendiamin dihydrochloride) the mean absorbance at 548nm was determined using SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, Nova Scotia, Canada) the number of live and dead cells in each well was enumerated using a hemocytometer after staining with Trypan blue. data analyses IBV genome load quantification IBV RNA copies per 200 ng of cDNA were calculated following performing qPCR assay. these chickens were not immunized and were housed in high containment poultry isolators at the University of Calgary\u2019s Spyhill campus or at the Foothills campus. the macrophage cell line, Muquarrab Qureshi-North Carolina State University (MQ-NCSU), is derived from mononuclear cells harvested from a chicken [12]. the embryos were incubated at 37.2\u00b0C and relative humidity of 60% for another 6 days. on 6 dpi, the embryos were euthanised and examined for the presence of embryo dwarfing and curling, which is characteristic for IBV infection. trachea and lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin for histological examination. cells were washed twice with HBSS and infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of IBV M41 or Conn A5968 strains. each section was subjected to two-color immunostaining to co-localize macrophages and IBV antigens. cells were washed twice with HBSS and infected at an MOI of 0.1 with IBV M41 or Conn A5968 strains or mock infected. each experiment was performed in triplicate. IBV at the dose rate of 2.75 x 104 EID50/bird [5], 4 birds were treated with PBS as uninfected controls. the experimental chickens were monitored for development of specific and non-specific clinical signs such as huddling under the lamp, ruffled feathers and increased respiratory rates. the confluent monolayers were washed twice with HBSS and infected with IBV M41 or Conn A5968 strains or mock infected in triplicate. at one hour, the cells were completely removed, the cells were washed twice with HBSS in order to remove potential residual inoculum. each experiment was performed in triplicate. 0.1 MOI of IBV M41 strain, 0.1 MOI of IBV Conn A5968 strain, 1g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control for NO induction or double stranded (ds) RNA. RPMI media was used as the negative control. all experiments were done in triplicates and repeated three times. all qPCR assays were conducted in a CFX96 Real-Time System C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON) using 96-well un-skirted, low profile PCR plates. a positive control (plasmid) and negative template control (RNAse-free water) were used in the reaction in a final reaction volume of 20 L. sections were incubated for 30 minutes with mouse monoclonal anti-chicken macrophage antibodies. sections were stained for endogenous avidin /biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) macrophages grown on coverslips were subjected to cell wall staining with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before being treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for permeabilization. coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield\u00ae antifade mounting medium. cell pellets were immersed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. cells were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide buffered with cacodylate. sections of 60 nm were cut in a leica EM UC7 using a diamond knife. images were obtained using an AMT 16000 digital camera. at 24 hours of culture supernatant transfer, these DF-1 cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 hpi the GFP signal was quantified under epifluorescent microscope following fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclear staining. the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. IBV RNA quantification A quantitative PCR protocol was used for IBV RNA determination in the cell culture supernatants using forward primer, IBV N Fw: 5\u2019GACGGAGGACCTGATGGTAA3\u2019 and reverse primer, IBV-N Re: 5\u2019CCCTTCTTCTGCTGATCCTG3\u2019. all qPCR assays were conducted in a CFX96 Real-Time System C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Miss amplification efficiency was determined by running a standard curve over a linear dynamic range (LDR) from 7 log10 copies/reaction to 1 log10 copies/reaction in the standard curve. frozen tissue sections (5 m) were adhered on positively charged slides, fixed with acetone (4\u00b0C) and stained for macrophages and IBV antigens sequentially. the sections were mounted on Vectashield\u00ae antifade mounting medium with DAPI nuclear stain. all incubations were carried out at room temperature in a humidifying chamber. first, macrophages grown on coverslips were subjected to cell wall staining with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594. cell pellets were immersed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours. cells were embedded in Epon 812 mixture following treating them with 1% osmium tetroxide buffered with cacodylate. sections of 60 nm were cut in a Leica EM UC7 (Leica IR, GmBH, Wet culture supernatants were transferred to DF-1 cells grown for 24 hours. DF-1 cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 hpi the GFP signal was quantified under epifluorescent microscope. signals were captured using an Olympus IX51 inverted epifluorescent microscope and quantified using Image-J\u00ae software. Statistical analyses Student\u2019s t- test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey\u2019s were done using the Graphpad software. 68 strains of IBV showed transient and nonspecific clinical signs starting at 3 dpi that included huddling under the lamp, increased respiration and ruffled feathers. histological examination of the tracheas and lungs of IBV Conn A5968, M41 and control chickens revealed lesions suggestive of IBV infection in infected chickens but not control chickens. in the IBV infected trachea, complete loss of cilia (a) and thickening of the mucosa. inflammation leading to reduced air exchange areas and reduced lumen of parabronchi are visible. also, the difference of mucosal thickening in the infected and uninfected trachea is shown. IBV M41 and Conn A5968 infections increase macrophage number in trachea and lungs. 6 days old SPF chickens were infected intra-tracheally as described in materials and methods. six days old chickens were infected intra-tracheally as indicated in Fig 1 legend. trachea and lungs were sampled at 4 dpi for double immunostaining of macrophages and IBV antigens. sections were stained for both macrophages and IBV antigens. oculum was drained and cells were washed 2 times with HBSS. cells were stained with horseradish wheat agglutinin conjugated with Alexa Flour 594. cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, stained for IBV N antigen and visualized using DAPI. the IBV RNA concentration in the cell culture supernatants peaked at 18 hpi. the peak RNA concentration was significantly higher with IBV Conn A5968 strain infection compared to the M41 strain (p0.001) infection. macrophage infections of IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains produce coronavirus-like particles within macrophages in vitro. low resolution images (a, b, c) and high resolution images (d, e, f) are shown with coronavirus-like particles (arrowheads). a), (b) and (d) = M41 strain of IBV; (c), (e) and (f) = Conn A5968 strain of IBV. production of NO, in response to infection with M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV, appears negligible. the percentage of dead cells with each treatment and controls (a) are shown. the remaining portions of macrophage cell culture supernatants were transferred (250l) to DF-1 cell monolayer for quantification of type 1 IFN activity. both M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV showed a higher type 1 IFN activity (P0.0001) when compared to the positive control, dsRNA, both M41 and conn A5968 strains of IBV showed a higher type 1 IFN activity (P0.0001) six days old chickens were infected intra-tracheally with IBV M41 (n = 5) and Conn A5968 (n = 5) strains with uninfected controls (n = 4) and lung and tracheal tissues were collected in OCT and 10% formal saline at 4 dpi. five m frozen sections were immunostained for demonstrating IBV antigen and paraffin embedded sections were stained. 122.6 16.0 macrophages were present in the trachea and lungs respectively. there were only 12.2 7.1 and 13.2 4.92 macrophages present in the control trachea and lungs respectively. higher macrophage numbers were also found in chickens infected with IBV Conn A5968 strain compared to the IBV M41 strain (P0.01). trachea and lung macrophages were detected in 3.6% (0.8) and 3.3% (0.7) of trachea and lung macrophages respectively. the number of macrophages carrying IBV antigens in trachea and lung was not significantly different for both IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains. the percentage of infected macrophages did not significantly differ between IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains. 1.5x 106 of MQ-NCSU cells were cultured on plastic coverslips in 6-well plates for 24 hours before infected with 0.1 MOI of IBV Conn A5968 or M41 strains. after 1 hour of adsorption period, inoculum was drained and cells were washed 2 times with HBSS to preclude subsequent qPCR reactions were carried out in triplicate for each time point. average number of IBV copies per 200 ng of starting RNA is shown with SEM. differences were considered significant at P0.05. MQ-NCSU macrophage cells were cultured on T25 culture flasks until 90% confluence was achieved. each experiment was performed in triplicate including an uninfected control. the plates were replaced with serum-free 2X MEM media. MQ-NCSU cells were seeded on 12-well plates and either infected or treated with 0.1 MOI of IBV Conn A5968 strain, IBV M41 strain, 1g/ml LPS, 50g/ml dsRNA or RPMI media. after 24-hour of stimulation period, cell culture supernatants were collected and NO content in a portion was measured using the Griess assay. difference in dead cell percentage between RPM1 and dsRNA treated and M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV infected MQ-NCSU cells was not observed (P>0.05) the percentages of dead cells in these groups were significantly lower when compared to that observed following LPS treatment (approximately 40%) of MQ-NCSU cells. replication of both M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV in macrophages in vitro does not induce NO production. the replication of both strains of IBV (e.g. M41 and Conn A5968) in vitro does not induce NO production. further studies are required to see if the IBV established infection in macrophages is strain dependent. however, we are aware that the IBV Beaudette strain is a nonpathogenic strain. it is likely that strain difference and macrophage tropism could be related to difference in virulence. avian macrophages are known to produce antiviral molecules such as NO and type 1 IFN [28, 29]. these two immune mediators are well known for their host responses against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. avian macrophages using infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) [38] infections do not interfere with type 1 IFN activity in vitro. IBV M41 and Conn A5968 infections of macrophages do not interfere with type 1 IFN activity in vitro. the ability of IBV to replicate in macrophages can be a major determinant of pathogenicity. the ability to infect macrophages can also determine the severity of some corona viral infections such as feline infectious peritonitis virus [49] and MERS-CoV infections [50]. this is a subject of further experiments. a double immunostaining technique was used to stain both macrophages and IBV antigens sequentially in a single section. these double immunostained sections were observed in two separate channels and then merged to visualize the co-localization."}
