{"summary": "clinical symptoms were initially observed in 3 miniature pinschers (45 days of age) and 1 cocker spaniel (53 days of age) same symptoms were observed 3\u20134 days later in 2 other miniature pinschers (45 days of age) and 1 Pekinese (56 days of age) CCoV type II strain (CB/05) was isolated from all tissues examined except brain tissue. immunohistochemical analysis with a CCoV-specific monoclonal antibody detected CCoV antigen in the organs with gross lesions that were examined. NSP 3c (244 aa) was 6 aa shorter and 79 aa longer than the cognate proteins of the enteropathogen strain BGF and the attenuated strain Insavc-1a respectively. two milliliters of cryolysate of a lung-derived first-passage virus in A-72 cells were administered intranasally to the dogs. the virus was reisolated from the experimentally infected dogs. experimental infection of dogs with the virus isolate resulted in a severe systemic disease that mimicked the clinical symptoms observed in the outbreak. however, the different ages at infection (6 months vs. 2 months) likely resulted in the disease being nonfatal. CCoV variants should always be considered as a potential threat to domestic dogs."}
