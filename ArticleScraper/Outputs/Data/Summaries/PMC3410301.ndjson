{"summary": "exosomes, shed microvesicles, ectosomes, microparticles, virosomes, virus-like particles, and oncosomes. microvesicles carry RNA [mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and noncoding sequences], cDNA and genomic sequences. they can also enter adjoining bodily fluids, such as the systemic circulation and travel to distant sites. extrachromosomal herpesvirus genomes are indicated by circles, retroviral genomes by sea-gull wings, and retrotransposons by the Y drawing. vesicles are exosomes or shed microvesicles containing viral or retrotransposon elements. exosomes range from 30 to 100 nm in diameter and are indicated in dual color. exosomes are released by outward budding directly from the plasma membrane. this release process is likely controlled by localized cytoskeleton dynamics. this type of budding is topologically identical to both the inward budding of the limiting membrane of MVBs and viral assembly. microvesicles can either be taken up by neighboring cells or travel through bodily fluids for cargo delivery into recipient cells at distant sites. cellular uptake of some microvesicles appears to depend, at least partly, on specific ligand-receptor recognition. tumor cells transfer mobile genetic elements via microvesicles to neighboring normal cells thereby modulating their genotype and phenotype. release of microvesicles has been extensively investigated, but recently the challenge has been to uncover the specific mechanisms that guide protein sorting and complexing into shed microvesicles. cells have been reported to secrete highly specified microvesicles after infectious exposure or under various cell activation conditions. intercellular processes are well orchestrated to produce specific cellular and immune outcomes. evading the host immune system, (2) invasion, (3) replication, and (4) persistence. microvesicles from infected cells can either enhance or block virus release from the infected cell and modulate the immune response. evasion strategy for HSV-1 is targeting of the MHCII molecule processing pathway by viral envelope glycoprotein B (gB) gB couples with HLA-DR, causing sorting through the exosome pathway as opposed to presentation on the cell surface. complexing of gB-DR effectively hijacks the cellular antigen presenting machinery. microvesicles can also incorporate elements from the cell, as well as from the intruding virion. in the case of the human CMV, microvesicles present the C-type lectin family molecule expressed on dendritic cells. this complex can be distributed to other cells by microvesicles, thus increasing the susceptibility of these cells to CMV. EC-derived microvesicles are not detected as infected cells but are rendered more susceptible to infection with subsequent encounters with the virus. microvesicular shedding increases T-cell surveillance and influx into the grafted tissues, thereby exacerbating allograft rejection. chimeric virus-like vesicles can be used as a vaccination strategy. early evasion strategies adopted by viruses interfere with complete elimination of the virus. such virus-like vesicles lack both the viral capsid and DNA. however, some of the viral tegument proteins contained within them are immediate early transcription factors. gB-DR complexes into the host immune microenvironment, promoting resistance of viruses to immune attack, and in some cases producing bystander T-cell tolergenicity or anergy. in the case of HIV, microvesicle packaging and spread of the virus-encoded Nef protein impairs proper endocytosis of the immature MHCII/invariant chain, antibody class switching, and lysosomal degradation of viral peptides HCV has been shown to release three phenotypically distinct types of microvesicles having variable infectivity from high to low. but differential release of these microvesicles during HCV pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. microvesicular release can contribute to viral attack by the host immune system. oncolytic viruses are currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy for cancer therapy. it would be of interest to determine whether microvesicles can alter the efficacy of oncolytic viruses, and other types of viral gene delivery vectors. EBV exploits endosomal-exosomal pathway by balancing intracellular signaling in infected B cells [69] and controlling epigenetic changes in uninfected neighboring cells via microvesicles [30]. Interestingly, mature HHV-6 virions are released together with internal vesicles through MVBs. newly infected nave B cells undergo multiple differentiation stages and tight interactions with surrounding stroma and T cells. this integral part of the EBV life cycle requires tight growth regulation in a specific EBV latency gene expression program. this strategy in expanding the infected pool of B cells without the need for lytic replication may be advantageous under normal conditions but raises the chances of turning-on malignant growth if the viral latency programs are not properly controlled. the inhibition of anti-EBV immune responses is believed to promote the progression of EBV-positive malignancies. exosome-cell interactions could be inhibited by specific antibodies against gp350 the major envelope protein of EBV or CD21 on B cells. this could be exploited for exosome-based anticancer therapies. miRNA profile of exosomes from EBV-driven LCL cells is consistent with the idea that viral miRNAs manipulate gene regulation in host cellular pathways. this is consistent with the idea that viral miRNAs in exosomes efficiently transport miRNAs through the immunological synapse during interactions of T cells with APCs. studies are underway to establish whether EBV exploits these intercellular contacts for efficient posttranscriptional control in neighboring responding immune cells. studies are underway to establish whether HIV itself may have microvesicle features, but microvesicles also have been described to have immune modulatory functions on HIV-infected cells. the controversy about the site of productive virus assembly in macrophages favors the plasma membrane. the controversy about the site of productive virus assembly in dendritic cells mostly favors the plasma membrane. however, these endocytic compartments were also described to be connected with the extracellular space [112, 113] the role of microvesicles during HIV infection has not yet been extensively studied. they appear to be involved in both HIV infectivity enhancement and resistance depending on the cells of origin. microvesicles derived from HIV-infected cells have been reported to contain HIV CCR5 coreceptors. retrotransposon elements such as LINE, Alu, and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) make up about 45% of the human genome and have played an important role in genome evolution. a number of active ones remain and are able to \u201cjump\u201d to new locations in the genome, contributing to genomic instability. three of the 11 human genes affected by VL30 mRNA were oncogenic. this suggests the transfer of retroviral RNA sequences can have catastrophic effects on recipient cells. a subset of L1 elements is still expanding in the number of sequences within the human genome by retrotransposition. HERVs also entered the human genome millions of years ago. they consist of gag, pol, and env sequences flanked by two long terminal repeats. some of these sequences are still transcriptionally active and are associated with diseases. herpesviruses originate from the nucleus and can merge with microvesicle pathways. similar observations have been made for retroviruses and retrotransposon elements with circulating microvesicles containing retrotransposon RNA."}
