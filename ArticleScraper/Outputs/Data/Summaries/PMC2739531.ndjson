{"summary": "expression of ACT, clusterin (CLU), 1-antitrypsin (AAT), haptoglobin -chain (HAP) and leucine rich glycoprotein (LRG) in the sera of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOCa) was recently reported. inverse correlation was apparently detected in the expression of LRG and CLU. serum samples of patients with different types of cancer showed different altered expression of selective serum high abundance acute-phase proteins (APPs) in sera of patients with EOCa [6], germ-line ovarian carcinoma [6], breast cancer [7], nasopharyngeal carcinoma [8], endometrial adenocarcinoma [9], squamous cell cervical carcinoma [9], adenocervical carcinoma [9] and osteosarcoma [10]. unfractionated whole human serum samples (10 l) were subjected to isoelectric focusing in rehydrated precast immobilized dry strips pH 4-7. focused samples in the strips were then subjected to electrophoresis using 8-18% gradient polyacrylamide gels in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. protein profiles were evaluated using the ImageMasterTM 2D Platinum Software. expression of proteins was evaluated in percentage of volume contribution (%vol), which refers to the volume percentage of a protein taken against the total spot volume of all proteins. 2-DE gels were developed by silver staining as described by Heukeshoven and Dernick [11] for mass spectrometric analysis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue according to the modified method of Shevchenko et al. ACT, AAT, LRG, CLU and HAP spots clusters were clearly resolved in all profiles. ACT, AAT, LRG, CLU and HAP spots clusters were clearly resolved in all profiles. expression of ACT, HAP and AAT appeared to be increasing with the first three stages of EOCa (Fig. 2, panels C, D and E, respectively). expression of ACT, HAP and AATf did not conform to altered progression changes. p = 0.0001 +15.34-fold; p = 0.0001 +3.94-fold; p = 0.0006 +5.50-fold; p = 0.0001 +2.84-fold; p = 0.0001 +6.78-fold; p = 0.0001 ns 0.2177 HAP +2.24-fold; p = 0.0001 +2.84-fold; p = 0.0001 +6.78-fold; p = 0.0001 ns unfractionated serum samples of negative control women were subjected to 2-DE and silver staining. panel A shows a typical representative 2-DE serum protein profile of negative control women and patients in different stages of EOCa. analysis was performed on the spot clusters of A:CLU, B:LRG, C:ACT, D:HAP, E:AAT, F:HAPc, and G:AATf. I, II, III and IV refer to various stages of EOCa in patients, while NC refers to the negative control. p = 0.0001 0.0008 HAPc # # # # 0.0757 AATf +7.30-fold; p = 0.0001 +8.91-fold; p = 0.0001 +14.14-fold; p = 0.0001 +14.14-fold; p = 0.0001 0.0388 *Fold change measures the degree of change in protein expression in patients compared to that of negative controls. the up-regulated expression of CLU in early stages of EOCa may function to suppress the biologically aggressive behavior of the cancer cells. in cases of non small cell lung and breast cancer, the expression of CLU was demonstrated to be significantly associated with relapse-free and metastasis-free survival of patients [16,17]. the serine proteinase inhibitor is known to form a complex with human kallikrein 3 (HK3; also known as prostate-specific antigen) it is very likely that the excess ACT detected in sera of the patients was part of a complex with HK3 or other proteins. this could not be verified since the gel-based approach adopted in our studies involved analysis of proteins in their denatured forms. our results highlight the potential prognostic significance of the high abundance serum APPs in patients with EOCa. competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
