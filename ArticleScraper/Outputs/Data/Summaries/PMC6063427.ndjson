{"summary": "pig feces, pig oral secretions, bioaerosols, and worker nasal wash samples were collected across 16 sites. PCV2 was detected in 21 pig fecal, 43 pig oral or water, 3 bioaerosol, and 78 worker nasal wash samples. this is evidenced by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus. it rapidly spread to at least 214 countries causing at least 151,700 human deaths within a cumulative 12 months of outbreak in each country. this environment calls for increased surveillance for emerging diseases. human survey protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University and the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Ministry of Health Malaysia. all enrolled human participants signed a written consent form, and animal farm managers gave verbal permission to collect samples from the pigs on their site. pigs were averse to chewing on a cotton rope suspended from their housing structure. number, age, and gender of the pigs in the sampled enclosures were recorded. mobile bioaerosol sampling localized to animal vendors. time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) probe-based assays for human adenovirus (ADV) [12], human coronavirus (CoV; multiplex assay) [13], encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [14], panspecies enterovirus (EV) [15], influenza A, B, C, and D viruses (IAV, IBV, ICV, IDV) [16\u201318], porcine the sample types were reported for variables determined to have a positive association at p0.10. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) ethics laboratory assays were conducted under biosafety level 2 conditions. field sampling methods were in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University. oral secretions were collected by allowing the pigs to chew on a cotton rope suspended from their housing structure. number, age, and gender of the pigs in the sampled enclosures were recorded. mobile bioaerosol sampling localized to animal vendors was conducted in the absence of other sampling types. real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) probe-based assays for human adenovirus (ADV) [12], human coronavirus (CoV; multiplex assay) [13], encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [14], panspecies enterovirus (EV) [15], influenza A, B, C, and D viruses (IAV, IBV, for each sample, 200 L was extracted using the QIAmp Cador Pathogen Mini Kit (cat. 54106 QIAGEN) per the manufacturer instructions. previously reported real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) probe-based assays for human adenovirus (ADV) [12], human coronavirus (CoV; multiplex assay) [13], encephalomyocardi Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) 11 farms, 2 abattoirs, and 3 animal markets were enrolled in Sibu and Kapit divisions of Sarawak, Malaysia in June and July of 2017. enrolled farms ranged from 0.12 to 2.43 hectares in size and housed a range of 100 to 7000 pigs. samples collected and viral prevalence At all sites, 78 out of 123 workers invited to participate agreed. 55 pig fecal, 49 pig oral or water, and 45 bioaerosol samples were collected across these sites.
