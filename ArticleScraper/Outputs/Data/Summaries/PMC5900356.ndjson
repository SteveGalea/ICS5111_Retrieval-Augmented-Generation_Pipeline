{"summary": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive restrictive lung disease with a high mortality rate and median survival of 2.5 yr after initial diagnosis. autophagy and the unfolded protein response (UPR) may modulate IPF pathogenesis. autophagy mitigates the effects of cellular stress, delivering damaged or improperly processed proteins and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. markers of UPR appear to be increased in lung tissue from IPF patients. this association could underpin the scarring process in the alveolar epithelium in the IPF lung (10). however, there remains a significant need to decipher the interplay between these processes in pathophysiology. we compared the requirement for autophagy and the UPR in IPF and non-IPF lung tissues using selective autophagy and UPR inhibitors. our data reveal an essential role of UPR and autophagy in profibrotic response of HLFs. anti-human GAPDH (sc-69778, 1:7,000) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. rabbit anti-human/mouse GRP78 (BIP; 3177, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-human/mouse IRE1 (3294, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-human/mouse SMAD2/3 (3102, 1:1,000), and rabbit anti-human/mouse/rat phospho-SMAD2 (3101, 1:1,000) were non-IPF and IPF human peripheral lung and airway fibroblast cultures were obtained from patients undergoing lung resection surgery for lung cancer. tissue acquisition was approved by informed consent of each donor according to protocols approved by the institutional Human Research Ethics Board. cultures were negative for endothelial and epithelial cell markers, Von Willebrand factor, and E-cadherin, respectively. primary cultured HAFs and lung fibroblasts were prepared as we have previously described from second to fourth generation of bronchi in macroscopically healthy segments of resected lung specimens. after microdissection to separate the submucosal compartment of the airway wall, HAFs were isolated by enzymatic dissociation western blotting was used to detect collagen 12, fibronectin, LC3II, Atg5-12, IRE1, Atg5-12, XBP1 and GAPDH. cells were washed and protein extracts prepared in lysis buffer.

HBSS containing 600 U/ml collagenase I, 2 U/ml protease, 2 U/ml papain, and 3.8 mM calcium chloride. tissue was disrupted by glass pipette trituration. debris was allowed to settle, and then the cells in the supernatant were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 800 g) the cells were redispersed in culture medium (high-glucose DMEM fibroblasts were cultured in serum-replete medium to 80% confluency. then maintained in serum-deficient medium supplemented with 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium for 48 h. cells were 100% confluent at the time they were harvested. protein content in supernatant was determined by lowry protein assay. proteins were then size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nylon membranes. blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. fibronectin forward: 5\u2032-GCC CAT AGC TGA GAA GTG TT-3\u2032; fibronectin reverse: 5\u2032-TTC CAG GCA AGT ACA ATC-3\u2032; and TBP reverse: 5\u2032-CAA GCT AAA GTC AGA GCA ATT A-3\u2032. all PCR reactions were run in triplicate. fluorescent images were captured with a leica CTRMIC 6000 confocal microscope in conjunction with a Hamamatsu C910013 spinning-disk camera. images were later analyzed using Volocity software. lungs do not differ in transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1)-induced fibrotic response, unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy activity. no differences were detected in UPR (B), fibrotic (C and D) and autophagy (E) markers between airway and lung fibroblasts. the abundance of both BIP/GRP78 and IRE-1 was significantly higher at baseline in IPF lung fibroblast cultures (P 0.001). hyperelevation of IRE1 was only sustained through 48 h (Fig. 2, A, F, G, and H) TGF-1 stimulation led to an increase in abundance of collagen I2 and fibronectin. abundance of autophagy proteins LC3II/LC3I and Atg5-12 was significantly lower in IPF fibroblasts compared with non-IPF fibroblasts. the degree of autophagy was significantly lower in non-IPF and IPF fibroblasts as compared with non-IPF fibroblasts. autophagy is required for TGF-1-induced fibrosis in both non-IPF and IPF fibroblasts. primary human IPF fibroblasts were treated with TGF-1 (2.5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of the autophagy chemical inhibitor bafiloECM A1 (10 nM) data in D represent examples of 4 different primary IPF fibroblasts. cotreatment with MKC8866 prevented sXBP1 formation. IRE1 inhibition prevents TGF-1-induced accumulation of fibronectin mRNA in IPF fibroblasts. XBP splicing is required for TGF-1-induced fibrosis in primary human fibroblasts. immunoblots are arranged to show expression of collagen 12, fibronectin and sXBP. treatment of IPF fibroblasts with IRE1 inhibitor significantly reduced collagen 12 and fibronectin biosynthesis. autophagy flux inhibition and IRE1 inhibition modulates UPR and autophagy in IPF fibroblasts. primary human IPF fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-1 (2.5 ng/ml) in the presence of bafilomycin-A1 (10 nM) or IRE1 inhibitor MKC8866 (10 M) puncta of LC3II were evident in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. double labeling revealed that LC3II-positive cells were positively labeled for BIP and sXBP1 in IPF lung lesions. human airway and lung fibroblasts isolated from nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) lungs do not differ in transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1)-induced fibrotic response, unfolded protein response, and autophagy activity. the abundance of both BIP/GRP78 and IRE-1 was significantly higher at baseline in IPF lung fibroblast cultures (P 0.001). however, the abundance of both BIP/GRP78 and IRE-1 was significantly higher at baseline in non-IPF fibroblast cultures. autophagy (LC3II and Atg5-12), and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (collagen 12 and fibronectin) were assessed by Western blot analysis. protein loading was confirmed using GAPDH. autophagy is necessary for TGF-1-induced fibrosis in non-IPF and IPF fibroblasts. we measured the impact of chemical inhibition of autophagy flux on TGF-1-induced synthesis of collagen 12. densitometry data are normalized to time-matched controls grown in ITS medium. data are shown in dot plots of from 4 individual experiments using different cell lines. the horizontal line in each column represents the mean, with error bars showing SE. a specific IRE1 inhibitor (MKC8866) that blocks XBP1 splicing (7) had no impact on TGF-1-induced collagen 12 and fibronectin biosynthesis in non-IPF fibroblasts. ire1 inhibition prevents sXBP1 formation, an effect that correlated with ablation of excessive TGF-1-induced collagen 12 and fibronectin synthesis in IPF fibroblasts. data are shown in dot plots of 4 individual experiments using different cell lines. the horizontal line in each column represents the mean, with error bars showing SE. NSP > 0.05, no significant difference. data reveal unique and potentially interconnected roles for autophagy and UPR in determining the response to TGF-1 in IPF lung fibroblasts. we measured the effects of IRE1 inhibition on autophagy and, vice versa, the effect of blocking autophagy flux on UPR in IPF fibroblasts. confocal microscopy showed robust labeling for all autophagy and UPR markers in IPF lungs. in lung parenchyma from non-IPF donors there was a paucity of labeling for LC3II, sXBP1 and BIP. LC3II-positive cells were positively labeled for BIP and sXBP1 in IPF lung tissue. we first compared the response to TGF-1 of HLFs and HAFs obtained from non-IPF donors. we found that UPR, autophagy, and profibrotic responses were the same in fibroblasts from lung parenchyma. we compared the temporal response to TGF-1 (2.5 ng/ml) of lung fibroblasts from IPF donors and non-IPF donors using immunoblotting to measure changes in the abundance of ECM proteins (collagen 12 and fibronectin), autophagy markers (LC3II, Atg5-12 complex) and UPR hallmarks. fibroblasts isolated from non-IPF lungs differ in TGF-1-induced fibrotic response, UPR, and autophagy activity. primary human non-IPF fibroblast and IPF fibroblasts (passages 3\u20136) were treated with TGF-1 (2.5 ng/ml) (0\u2013120 h) primary human IPF fibroblasts (passages 2\u20133) were treated with TGF-1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 96 h and then treated with bafiloECM A1 (Baf-A1; 100 nM) for up to 4 h more. LC3II accumulation and p62 degradation were measured using GAPDH as protein loading confirmed. densitometry analysis of different IPF and non-IPF fibroblasts confirmed that autophagy inhibition significantly inhibited TGF-1-induced collagen biosynthesis in human non-IPF fibroblasts. in non-IPF HAFs, we used immunoblotting to track the effects of TGF-1 exposure on the induction of sXBP1. a specific IRE1 inhibitor (MKC8866) that blocks XBP1 splicing (7) had no impact on TGF-1-induced collagen 12 and fibronectin biosynthesis in non-IPF fibroblasts. the representative immunoblot shows the abundance of collagen 12, fibronectin, and sXBP in 4 different primary non-IPF fibroblasts. the horizontal line in each column represents the mean, with error bars showing SE. ed TGF-1-induced fibronectin mRNA accumulation in IPF fibroblasts. the experiments were performed in duplicate on 2 different primary IPF fibroblast cells. tochemistry to evaluate the distribution of autophagy and UPR marker proteins (LC3II, sXBP1 and BIP) in non-IPF and IPF lung tissue. fibrotic lesions replete with fibroblasts and significant loss of alveolar structure. confocal images of control and IPF lung tissue for LC3II (green), XBP (red), and DAPI (blue) scale bars are included in each image. we have investigated the association and contribution of autophagy and UPR in TGF-1-induced profibrotic effects in fibroblasts from the lungs of human non-IPF and IPF donors. studies of liver fibrosis indicate that chemically induced liver injury causes hepatic stellate cell activation and promotes lipid catabolism. this reduces liver fibrosis, particularly in steatosis-related cirrhosis. this is contrary to previous data showing that TGF-1 can decrease autophagy. a longer duration treatment may support more sustained induction of secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that influence the final autophagy response. ER stress inducer tunicamycin exacerbates lung fibrosis in bleiomycin-challenged rats. enhanced ER stress in alveolar epithelial cells appears to be a facilitator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process associated with pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. targeting the IRE1 branch of UPR holds some potential to mitigate pathobiological aspects of lung fibrotic diseases. we demonstrate that TGF-1 induces higher levels of ER stress and UPR in fibroblasts from IPF patients compared with patients without IPF. role of autophagy in TGF-1-induced fibrosis is critical in IPF.
