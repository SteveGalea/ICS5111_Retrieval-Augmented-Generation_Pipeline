{"summary": "CPXV belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV) in the family Poxviridae. the primary reservoir host seems to be rodents [3], as serological surveys have shown that the virus is widespread among European wild rodents. despite its name, it has not been isolated from cattle during the last three decades. cheetah enclosures at ha safari park are located in the east of Jutland, Denmark. the zoo houses 2\u20133 adult males, 3\u20134 adult females, and their offspring until they are approximately two years old. all enclosures have natural vegetation with high grass and small bushes. samples taken from the lip and the nasal planum were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. sections of the samples were routinely processed, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. genomes were assembled by using a combination of velvet [17] and SOAPdenovo2 [18], yielding the entire viral genome in a single contig of over 200 kb in length in all cases. error correction was performed by mapping all reads from each sample to the respective assembled genome by using bowtie2 [19], and discrepancies were visually inspected. UV-inactivated cell lysate was prepared by infecting HEp-2 cells. polysorp microwell plates were coated with 100 L of lysate of infected or non-infected HEp-2 cells at 4 g/mL in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) over night at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed with 4 300 L of washing buffer. each serum was tested in two replicate measurements on both infected and non-infected HEp-2 cell lysate. Binding signals against non-infected HEp-2 cell lysate were subtracted from signals against vaccinia virus-infected cells. sera with a differential binding signal above 0.05 were considered positive. no ethics committee has been involved. genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Full viral genome sequences were gained from one specimen of each cluster by using either DNA from cell culture isolates. samples from clusters 1\u20134 were subjected to IonTorrent PGM sequencing. cytopathic effects were evident under the microscope. serum was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. plates were washed with 4 300 L of washing buffer. 100 L per well of non-inactivated sera were incubated in washing buffer. signals were developed for 15 minutes by using 100 L of SeramunSlow TMB substrate (Diavita) per well before the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 L of 0.25 M H2SO4. each serum was tested in two replicate measurements on both infected and non-infected HEp-2 cell lysate. unknown Split 18 months - 2 Top Cut 7 months B\u2013 1 Aug 31, 2011 Generalized 19 Clyde 7 months Sep 13, 2011 Ulcers on tongue Unknown Aduke 6 years - Bonnie 7 months - 3 Nuru 7 years B\u2013 2 Sep 7, 2012 Severe skin lesions 20 4 Hurley 30 months A\u2013 1 Oct 5, 2012 Facial lesions 13 Jack 30 months - Sawyer 30 months - 5 Nova 30 months A\u2013 1 Sep 11, 2014 Severe skin lesions 11 Heidi 30 months the animal received broad-spectrum antibiotic (8 mg/kg cefovecin once i.m.) the affected areas were biopsied and the animal was isolated in the stable ten days after initial symptoms. a fissure was observed on the tongue of the mother (Tosha) and on the following day one of its sisters had a lesion on the upper lip. a 7-year-old male (Nuru) developed severe pox-like lesions in the face. within days, the entire body was covered by visible pustules. the animal was kept under oral antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. sections from the lip and nasal planum showed diffuse ulcerative exudative necrotic cheilitis and nasal dermatitis. sections from the skin nodule showed similar ulceration, exudation, and necrosis, but also showed some areas with intact epidermis and hair follicle walls. keratinocytes in epidermis and in some hair follicle walls showed extensive disruption and hydropic degeneration. cluster ID Time from first symptoms to sampling in d Material Cq OPV Cq c-myc Cq (OPV\u2014 c-myc) 28.2 34.2 -6.0 Grey 12 Lung tissue*# 9.8 20.7 -10.9 12 Blood 19.9& - - 12 Vulvar swab 29.9 21.6 8.3 12 Oral swab 24.0 23.1 0.9 12 Rectal swab 24.3 26.2 -1.9 Rec a CPXV-specific real-time PCR and HA sequencing confirmed the infection with OPV and further classified the causative agent as CPXV. a whole genome sequence was reconstructed from one sample of each cluster. a whole genome sequence was reconstructed from one sample of each cluster. all symptomatic animals developed high OPV-antibody titers within the first month after symptom onset with IgM1:320 and IgG1:20,480. animals that had never been in contact with symptomatic animals showed no or only low OPV-antibody responses. in our experience only IgM titers 80 and IgG titers > 320 are considered meaningful. results from CPXV-infected individuals shown with indication of timespan from symptom onset to sampling. animals that had never been in direct contact with an affected animal developed no or only low antibody responses. animals involved in clusters 1\u20135 taken before the outbreak &previously vaccinated with MVA were analyzed for OPV antibody status. a new ELISA was established which showed excellent agreement with IFA data. none of these animals showed symptoms compatible with CPXV infection. an IgG 1:320 or differential ELISA > 0.05 is considered positive. clinical cases An overview of groups of cheetahs affected in five outbreaks between 2010 and 2014 is given in Table 1. examples of clinical presentations for typical and atypical lesions observed during the outbreaks are shown in Fig 2. Table 1. the first clinical case occurred in the park in October 2010. a mother (Tosha) was housed together with one son (Sheppard) and three daughters (Grey, Izzy, Split) the index patient presented with ulcerative skin lesions on the lower lip and nostril. cluster 2\u20132011 (Top Cut) was a breeding female (Aduke) and two male (Top Cut, Clyde) and one female offspring (Bonnie) only one of the five animals (Split) did not show any symptoms. a 2.5-year-old male (Hurley) had typical pox lesions only in the face. he recovered after 13 days without any treatment. no lesions were seen in the siblings. female Grey with respiratory symptoms died 12 days after onset of symptoms. only one of the five animals (Split) did not show any symptoms. cluster 2\u20132011 (Top Cut) was a family group. cluster 2 developed severe pox-like lesions in the face. within days, the entire body was covered by visible pustules. the animal was kept under oral antibiotics (5 mg/kg enrofloxacin SID p.o.) keratinocytes in epidermis and hair follicle walls showed extensive disruption and hydropic degeneration. the combination of the necrotic and ulcerative inflammation and the cytoplasmic epithelial inclusion bodies led to a presumptive diagnosis of cutaneous poxviral infection. sections of the skin at the site of the toe wound from Top Cut (cluster 2) showed very similar histological lesions. a CPXV-specific real-time PCR and HA sequencing confirmed the infection with OPV and further classified the causative agent as CPXV. the five representative outbreak sequences from Ree Park clearly form a distinct clade, with intra-clade distances much lower than the distance of any of the outbreak sequences to any other known CPXV. the intra-clade distances are still larger than those observed within clades formed by other CPXV known to come from distinct outbreak events. animals that had never been in contact with symptomatic animals showed no or only low OPV-antibody responses (IgM80 and IgG1:320) the animals that had never been in contact with symptomatic animals showed no or only low OPV-antibody responses. CPXV-infected animals developed high OPV antibody titers. titers from animals that shared the same enclosure but remained symptom free are shown in the upper part of the table. OPV seropositivity of other animals kept at the institution or caught in zoo grounds between 2011 and 2015 is given in Table 4. none of these animals showed symptoms compatible with CPXV infection. a whole genome sequence was reconstructed from one sample of each cluster. the five representative outbreak sequences from Ree Park clearly form a distinct clade. intra-clade distances are much lower than those observed within clades formed by other CPXV known to come from distinct outbreak events. phylogenetic placement of CPXV from outbreak clusters in cheetahs among all known CPXV genomes. animals that had never been in contact with symptomatic animals showed no or only low OPV-antibody responses. animals that had never been in contact with symptomatic animals showed no or only low OPV-antibody responses. in our experience only IgM titers 80 and IgG1:320 are considered meaningful. CPXV-infected animals developed high OPV antibody titers. titers from animals that shared the same enclosure were shown in the upper part of the table. OPV seropositivity was shown for multiple animals from different species. cheetahs seem to be more prone to CPXV infections than other exotic cat species. two out of three symptomatic cheetahs died; six contact animals did not have clinical infection. in a recent outbreak at Chester Zoo in 2012, a family group of five cheetahs got sick and two 4-month-old cubs died. but four other cheetahs in the same institution were not affected. 14 out of 21 examined water voles (Arvicola amphibius) caught in the grounds showed antibody titers against poxvirus. outbreaks occurred over a 5-year period, always during late summer/autumn (August\u2013October) the sequences from the five cheetah clusters do not cluster as closely as other sequences coming from a single outbreak. the low intra-clade distances and the relatively large distance to any sequence from outside the cheetah clade are consistent with the hypothesis of CPXV circulating and evolving in the region. isolation is considered the most important management tool to avoid further spread of the disease. it is not known whether the low mortality at Ree Park is due to a CPXV strain with low virulence or whether different management during the outbreaks contributed to a higher survival rate. all cheetahs were vaccinated in 2013 by using the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) smallpox vaccine. the same vaccination has already been used in felids, but only sporadically. a 4-week preshipment quarantine for all cheetahs that leave the institution has been made obligatory. the quarantined animals are kept inside a stable from the day a first blood sample is taken until the day they leave. no change or decrease in antibodies is considered to be negative for signs of current infection. a high degree of correlation between both methods (Pearson r = 0.97) was found."}
