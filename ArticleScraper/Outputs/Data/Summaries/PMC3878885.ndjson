{"summary": "the early focus was in Asia, but recent evidence suggests that Egypt is a new epicenter for the disease. we analyzed 226 HA and 92 NA sequences with an emphasis on the H5N1 2.2.1.1 strains in Egypt using a Bayesian discrete phylogeography approach. this allowed modeling of virus dispersion between Egyptian governorates including the most likely origin of virus spread. since the original human cases of H5N1 originated in Asia, much of the attention concerning the virus has been in Asian countries. countries farther to the west such as Egypt have also been impacted by the disease and offer important clues about zoonotic transmission between animals and humans. analysis by Cattoli et al.[18] indicated that the Egyptian strains formed a monophyletic cluster across all gene segments. this suggested limited nucleotide diversity and that the isolates originated from the same ancestor. authors noted some geographic variation with groups A and B primarily from southern governorates [21] but the mixing of Nile Delta region across all of the groups indicated that vicariance was not constant. more recent work by Eladl et al. described genetic characterization of HPAI H5N1 from Egyptian poultry farms during the 2006\u20132009 time period and classified three main groups within clade 2.2.1- A, B, and C [22] the disease was spread over the country\u2019s four main areas: Cairo, Nile Delta, Canal, and Upper Egypt. the Nile Delta region had the highest total, which is consistent with other work [4] and represents about half of the country\u2019s population. more recent work by Eladl et al. described genetic characterization of HPAI H5N1 from Egyptian poultry farms during the 2006\u20132009 time period. more recent work by Eladl et al. described genetic characterization of HPAI H5N1 from the 2006\u20132009 time period and classified three main groups within clade 2.2.1- A, B, and C. a better understanding of disease pathways leads to a better understanding of disease pathways and spread. this allows for planning strategies to reduce risks, set priorities, allocate resources effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher benefit-cost ratios with existing or minimal resources [25]. clade includes 16 of the 57 2010\u20132012 sequences (28%) added from the IRD database. black branches in the tree indicate weak support (posterior probability.65) a higher Kullback\u2013Leibler value indicates more divergence of the root state posterior probability from its prior. both HA and NA had an AI and PS p-value 0.05. both HA and NA had an AI and PS p-value 0.05. Fayyum Al Qalyubiyah route had the strongest support with a Bayes Factor value of 34.40. the map is a zoom-in of the Delta Region. Qalyubiyah NA 6.04 Al Jizah Al Minufiyah Significant routes had a Bayes Factor (BF) of at least 6. unlike the HA, the majority of the routes begin and end in the Delta region. however, it also contains a route from the delta region in the north to the Qina governorate in the south. about 80% of broiler farms apply some degree of vaccination protocol [29] which limits the probability of virus detection. Cairo is generally considered as the biggest market for live birds in the country. LBMs and poultry shops absorb about 80% of the total commercially produced poultry. our phylogeographic models found several similarities and differences between the HA and NA datasets. both models indicated weak support for Ash Sharqiyah as the origin of the spread. however, there were differences about significant dispersion routes. al Qalyubiyah alone produces about 69 percent of the native Baladi chicken. al Qalyubiyah is considered a center for production and trading of fertile Baladi eggs that are often taken and hatched in southern governorates such as sohag. our discrete model has limitations including inferring the migration paths by only considering the observed locations. removing a state that was observed only once in both data sets would remove it completely from the model. findings are based on a closed system of locales and genetic samples and may not provide a complete representation of influenza diffusion within Egypt. in total, 74 (82%) HA sequences had a governorate name in the country metadata field and were included in the final data set. the most recent date in clade 2.2.1.1 [34] was only 2010, thus we used the Influenza Research Database to download additional HA sequences from 2010\u20132012 in Egypt. RD to identify additional NA sequences from 2010\u20132012. additional files 1 and 2 show maps of the governorates with the number of HA and NA sequences (respectively) included in this study. jModeltest selected TIM1 + G for HA and GTR + G for NA. for the NA dataset, we re-ran an additional MCMC of 20 million steps. we then performed a series of extra steps offline. we used the program Bayesian Tip-Significance testing (BaTS) [50] to calculate the AI and the PS. we modeled our approach after the work done by Lemey et al. for studying the phylogeography of H5N1 on a global perspective [13]. jModeltest selected TIM1 + G for HA and GTR + G for NA. for the NA dataset, we re-ran an additional MCMC of 20 million steps. we then performed a series of extra steps offline. authors\u2019 contributions MS designed the study and wrote the manuscript.
