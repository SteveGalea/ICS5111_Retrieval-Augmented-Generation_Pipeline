{"summary": "the human nose is an important branch of the mucosal immune system. mucosal surfaces that cover the gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary, and genital tracts function as immunologic sensors to detect dangerous signals including pathogens. mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1; 104 PFU) delivered intranasally in a small volume (1 l in each nostril) to generate nasal-only inoculation. we failed to recover any virus in the lungs during the course of the experiment using either real-time quantitative RT-PCR or virus titration. mice with such nasal inoculum did not lose weight or display any signs of MHV-1 pneumonia. the major cell type in BALFs from both groups was alveolar macrophages. both groups had very few T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), neutrophils (Ly6G+CD11b+) or NK cells (NKp46+CD3\u2013) cells in the BALF. we examined whether nasal-only inoculation with MHV-1 could modulate the mortality and morbidity of lethal pneumonia by SARS-CoV and IAV. prior nasal MHV-1 inoculation dramatically reduced the mortality rate of SARS-CoV pneumonia from 100% to 0%. -1 inoculation significantly reduced mortality and morbidity of lethal pneumonia by heterologous viruses. BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with MHV-1 or vehicle. two days later, mice were infected with SARS-CoV (104 PFU) or IAV (PR-8 strain, 1,160 TCIU) hyalinization (arrowheads) and extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in both alveolar space and lung parenchyma are illustrated. modest amounts of congestion and inflammatory infiltration in the alveolar septum was found in mice with MHV-IAV infections. MHV-1 remotely primes lung innate immunity by recruiting Ly6C+ IMs. n = 3\u20137 per group, pooled from 2 independent experiments. the frequencies of Ly6C+ IMs in both left and right lungs were then analyzed and expressed as percentage of CD45+ singlet cells (F and G) n = 3\u201312, pooled from 3 different experiments. the lack of change in cell number suggests that the Ly6C+ IMs are situated primarily in the lung parenchyma but not in the pulmonary vessels or alveolar spaces. previous studies have shown that the recruitment of Ly6C+ IMs to sites of virus infection in the lung is IFN-I dependent (12\u201314) IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and BALB/c mice were treated with MHV-1 intranasally (IN, 2 l, 104 PFU) or IT (50 l, 104 PFU) the mice were sacrificed at 2 days p.i. the frequency and numbers of Ly6C+ IMs in the lungs were then determined. the expression levels of CD11c, MHCII, CD86, CD80, and CD40 on Ly6C+ IMs were increased to a lesser degree than after IT infection. mice with nasal-only inoculation were treated with MHV-1 intranasally or IT (50 l 104 PFU) or with vehicle. mice with nasal-only inoculation exhibited significantly more TNF-secreting Ly6C+ IMs in the lungs, in comparison to noninfected controls. there was no difference between isotype-stained cells and TNF antibody\u2013treated cells in the 2 groups. NF and INF- in mice with nasal-only inoculation after SARS-CoV infection. intranasally infected mice with MHV-1, followed by IT infection with SARS-CoV. both TNF and IFN- levels were dramatically increased at 24 hours after SARS-CoV infection. mice with nasal infection but not controls exhibited more FITC+ Ly6C+CD11b+ IMs in MLNs. FITC+ IMs recruited by nasal MHV-1 inoculation were prime for both antigen uptake and migration. response in the lungs of MHV-1\u2013primed mice was treated with MHV-1 2 days prior to challenge with a lethal dose of sARS-CoV. prior nasal inoculation of MHV-1 significantly enhanced the SARS-CoV\u2013specific CD4+ and CD8+ cell responses in the lungs. no virus was detected in the lungs by plaque assay or qRT-PCR. clinically, mice with such nasal inoculum did not lose weight. the major cell type in BALFs from both groups was alveolar macrophages. upregulated B cell expression of Ly6C was one of the earliest events in the NALT after nasal-only MHV-1 inoculation. further, the B/T cell ratio, B cell frequency, and numbers in the NALT but not the cervical lymph nodes were significantly reduced within 12\u201324 hours p.i. a non-CoV infection, we infected mice with mouse-adapted IAV (PR-8 strain, 1,160 TCIU) in 50 l per mouse via IT instillation. prior nasal MHV-1 inoculation significantly reduced mortality and morbidity of lethal pneumonia by heterologous viruses. MHV-SARS (n = 10), SARS (n = 10), and MHV+Veh (n = 5) using repeated-measures ANOVA. **P 0.001, MHV-SARS (n = 5) vs. SARS (n = 5) modest amounts of congestion and inflammatory infiltration in the alveolar septum were found in mice with MHV-IAV infections (thin arrow) data are from at least 2 independent experiments. intranasal; Inf Mon, inflammatory monocytes. n = 3\u20137 per group, pooled from 2 independent experiments. data in B are expressed as percentage of CD45+ cells. pulmonary vessels examined whether such intervention changed the frequency of these cells in comparison to the non-perfused side in the same animals. the lack of change in cell number suggests that the Ly6C+ IMs are situated primarily in the lung parenchyma but not in the pulmonary vessels or alveolar spaces. previous studies have shown that the recruitment of Ly6C+ IMs to sites of virus infection in the lung is IFN-I dependent (12\u201314) the vagus nerve has a similar role after nasal-only MHV-1 inoculation. the contralateral side was sham-treated without vagotomy. mice were then intranasally treated with MHV-1 14 days later. HC class II (MHCII), CCR7, CD86, CD80, and CD40 on Ly6C+ IMs recruited by nasal-only as opposed to IT MHV-1 infection. however, in mice with nasal-only inoculation, expression levels of CD11c, MHCII, CD86, CD80, and CD40 were increased to a lesser degree than after IT infection. NF is one major antiviral mechanism employed by Ly6C+ IMs (13, 19, 20) we harvested lung-derived cells on day 2 p.i. and treated them with LPS (1 ng/l) or vehicle (RP10) for 6 hours directly ex vivo. in the absence of LPS treatment, Ly6C+ IMs from both noninfected and MHV-1\u2013primed mice did not produce TNF. increased TNF and INF- in mice with nasal-only inoculation after sARS-CoV challenge. both TNF and IFN- levels were dramatically increased at 24 hours after sARS-CoV infection. mice with nasal infection but not controls exhibited more FITC+ Ly6C+CD11b+ IMs in MLNs. FITC+ cells were primed for both antigen uptake and migration to the MLNs. MHV-1\u2013primed mice were treated intranasally with MHV-1 2 days prior to challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV. prior nasal inoculation of MHV-1 significantly enhanced the SARS-CoV\u2013specific CD4+ and CD8+ cell responses in the lungs. low volumes of pneumotropic or neurotropic murine CoV remotely primes the immune environment in the lungs. these cells were less activated and thus less proinflammatory, as they expressed lower levels of CD86/80, CD40, MHCII, and CD11c. after LPS stimulation, these cells were able to secrete TNF in the lungs, suggesting a role in the initiation or enhancement of the innate immune response. indirect remote priming of the lung environment by viral exposure of the nose can prepare the lung for more robust infections. we rigorously excluded the possibility of lung exposure to virus, as we failed to detect any MHV-1 in the lungs using either qRT-PCR or viral titration. cross talk between two distinct and distant mucosal sites has been previously reported. depletion of the gut microbiota was associated with increased bacterial dissemination, decreased TNF and IL-10 secretion, and increased organ damage and mortality during pneumococcal pneumonia. underlying mechanism remains poorly understood but may involve B cell activation. a robust immunopathogenic role for Ly6C+ IMs in mice infected with SARS-CoV was demonstrated (25), resulting in increased lethality. a robust immunopathogenic role for Ly6C+ IMs was demonstrated (25), resulting in increased lethality. aldridge et al. (42) showed that moderate infiltration of Ly6C+ IMs in the lungs protected mice from lethal IAV pneumonia. however, excessive infiltration and elimination of these cells were detrimental due to associated immunopathology and reduced CD8+ T cell responses. how Ly6C+ IMs prevent disease in low-dose MHV-1\u2013infected mice is not yet understood. early exposure to pathogens in the nose and upper airways can immunologically prepare the lungs for more rapid initiation of innate and adaptive immune response against homologous and heterologous infection. our data implicate crosstalk between distant mucosal sites in the nose and lung, suggesting a common mucosal immune system as a mechanism connecting the nose and lung. mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) was obtained from Kanta Subbarao (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for intranasal infection, we first determined a volume that did not cause aspiration. qRT-PCR was performed on a Applied Biosystems 7300 system using SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (QIAGEN) Previously described primers specific for MHV-1 genomic RNA were used to measure expression of genomic RNA. samples with Ct values at or below those from mock-infected mice were considered negative for viral genomic RNA. cells were analyzed using a FACSVerse (BD) for antigen-specific T cells following SARS-CoV infection. 1 106 cells were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate in the presence of Brefeldin A and peptides corresponding to a CD8+ T cell epitope (S566) or a CD4+ T cell epitope (N353) (Bio-Synthesis) lungs were minced and digested in HBSS containing 0.1 mg/ml of DNase (Roche), 1 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche), 2% FCS, and 25 mM HEPES. Digested tissues were then gently dispersed and passed through a 70-m nylon filter to prepare single-cell suspensions. mice were infected intranasally with MHV-1 (2 l, 104 PFU) or vehicle clinical illness was determined blindly using a grading system. data are expressed as mean SEM. log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test were used to analyze differences in survival. BALB/c mice were intranasally treated with 1% Evans blue in PBS. radiolabeled sulfur colloid solution (5 l per nostril) was intranasally administered to mice under light anesthesia using isoflurane. radioactivity was determined scintigraphically 20 minutes later. samples with Ct values at or below those from mock-infected mice were considered negative for viral genomic RNA. whole lungs of infection and controls were used for cytokine measurements. cells were analyzed using a FACSVerse (BD) for antigen-specific T cells following SARS-CoV infection. 1 106 cells were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate in the presence of Brefeldin A and peptides corresponding to a CD8+ T cell epitope (S566) or a CD4+ T cell epitope (N353) (Bio-Synthesis) mice were infected intranasally with MHV-1 (2 l, 104 PFU) or vehicle. two days later, mice were sacrificed, and single-cell suspensions of the lungs were prepared. two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between 2 groups. weight loss was analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test were used for multiple comparisons."}
