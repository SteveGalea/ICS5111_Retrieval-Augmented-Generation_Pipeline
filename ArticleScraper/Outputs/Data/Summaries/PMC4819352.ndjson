{"summary": "the specificity of the LAMP amplified products was tested by digesting with restriction enzyme XmnI for alpha toxin gene. out of 120 samples screened 112 (93.3%) samples were positive by both LAMP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of cpa gene. the cpb2 producing C. perfringens Type A has also been linked to disease in several animal species. PCR got several intrinsic disadvantages, such as requirement of thermal cycling, time-consuming, post-PCR analysis, and high-risk for cross-contamination. the DNA was extracted from the 24 h broth culture by boiling method. the sample was preserved at 20\u00b0C. the primer details and location were given in Table-1 and Figure-1.

DNA was extracted from 24 h broth culture. the inner primers were known as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3) which helps in strand displacement. the inner primers were known as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (B3). loop mediated isothermal amplification primers location Clostridium perfringens plc gene. standardized primers, enzyme, temperature and time combinations for amplification of cpa gene. LAMP amplification reaction was carried out in hot water bath at 55\u00b0C for 60 min. Enzyme inactivation was carried out after completion of reaction at 80\u00b0C for 10 min. amplified products were stored at20\u00b0C. the large fragment was used successfully in the present study in place of Bst DNApolymerase. same concentration of the Bst DNA polymerase enzyme was used by earlier workers for successful LAMP reaction for amplification of Bordetella pertussis, Capri poxviruses viral genome. of 120 samples screened by LAMP for alpha toxin specific primers 112 (93.30%) samples showed amplification of alpha toxin gene in the samples. similar type of comparison between reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP and RT-PCR was made. RT-LAMP was more sensitive than RT-PCR for detection of SARS corona virus. restriction enzyme map for loop mediated isothermal amplification product of alpha toxin gene of Clostridium perfringens with restriction enzyme (Xmnl) treatment. standardization of LAMP reaction for amplification of etx and cpb genes should be limited to diagnostic applications in the developing counties. authors\u2019 contributions BR is the student worked for MVSc thesis.
