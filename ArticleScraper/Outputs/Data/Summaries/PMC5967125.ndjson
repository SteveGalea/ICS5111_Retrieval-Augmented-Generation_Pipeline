{"summary": "viruses share a reduced genome size and optimize a confined genetic space. one of these strategies is to produce polyproteins that are further processed by proteases into smaller working units. this strategy ensures production of multiple components required for viral infection in a single molecule. viruses encode three types of proteases: cysteine (67.2%), aspartic (9.0%), and serine (23.8%) proteases. different drugs targeting proteases have been used effectively for treating animal viral infections. total number of plant viral species was based on the ICTV Master Species List. types of proteases and percentages were calculated counting the total number of proteases present in each of the accounted viral species. TYMV, Turnip yellow mosaic virus, Tymovirus; BYV, Beet yellow virus, Closterovirus; CTV, Citrus tristeza virus, Closterovirus; BBScV, Blueberry scorch virus, Carlavirus; BNYVV, Beet necrotic yellow vein virus, Benyvirus; TSWV, Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, Orthotospovirus; AthAthV-At, Arabidopsis RNA Picorna-like P1 Unclassified Unknown Cis Counterdefense Pro S39 Serine/ Chymotrypsin-like Cis/trans Replication Tymoviridae.

NIapro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease that acts in cis and in trans. it is involved in the generation of intermediate (such as P3-6K1, CI-6K2 and 6K2-NIa) and final products at different stages of infection. this is the best characterized plant viral protease, functionally and structurally. studies with the waikavirus rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and the nepovirus tomato ringspot virus (TomRSV) have characterized the viral protease (Pro) and their cleavage sites. so far little is known about specific involvement of these proteases in viral replication. the protease and cleavage sequence are conserved in P2a and P2ab. this points to a regulatory process in protease activity that might have an influence in replication considering the inhibitory effect observed in vitro that VPg has over the polymerase. TYMV PRO is a functional ovarian tumor-like deubiquitylating enzyme. this activity helps PRO to modulate viral replication by stabilizing the viral polymerase preventing degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome system. the alphavirus-like supergroup does not maintain a conserved protease in all members as the picornavirus-like does. beet necrotic yellow vein virus encodes a papain-like cysteine protease domain (PCP) it has been hypothesized that it might act as a DUB to favor RdRp transcription (Pakdel et al., 2015), similar to the mode of action of the PCP domain of hepatitis E virus (HEV) PPV P1 modulates P1HC processing and indirectly affects viral replication. proteases could be considered as having a counterdefense role. if a protease potentiates a positive effect on replication it is not due to a specific role in this viral process. and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and its protease are not interrelated. the protease activity can be uncoupled by mutations that selectively suppress the DUB activity without altering PRO (Jupin et al., 2017). the best characterized proteases are the ones from the Picornaviridae family. NIapro from potato virus Y (PVY) acts as elicitor of hypersensitive response mediated by gene Ry in potato. its protease activity appears to be involved in this eliciting response. more recent studies have described a role of potyviral NIapro in enhancing aphid transmission. togavirin is a viral protease directly involved in virion formation. it self-processes from the polyprotein precursor, binds viral RNA, and assembles into the capsid. cleavage of viral polyproteins at specific sites is crucial for transforming the immature shell into an active infectious particle. cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a member of the Caulimovirus genus. CP is involved in virion assembly, packaging of viral RNA and delivery of the genome to the nucleus. CP may operate as an anchoring domain for the initiation of viral assembly. PR is expressed in an inactive monomeric form and needs to dimerize. it needs to acquire an active conformation in which each unit contributes an aspartate to the active site. it is anticipated that PR of Caulimoviridae also acts as dimers. analyses of PPV chimeras including P1 sequences of tobacco vein mottling virus and of virus variants with different biological properties sorted from a single PPV isolate also pointed toward the involvement of P1 in host range definition. more direct evidence of the involvement of the protease activity of NIapro in host range definition comes from works performed with P1a of cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) and P1 of PPV, both P1a-like proteases PPV is a cysteine proteinase whose first identified function was to aid in aphid transmission of viral particles. HC is a cysteine proteinase whose first identified function was to aid in aphid transmission of viral particles. but the main function of the potyviral HC appears to be suppressing antiviral RNA silencing. cleaving leader proteinases of viruses of the Closteroviridae family are a good example. they are involved in virus accumulation, systemic transport, host range expansion or virus superinfection exclusion. but all these roles appeared to be independent of their protease activities. RYMV P1, a protein with RNA silencing suppression activity, is expressed as a mature protein. but in experimental conditions it displays self-cleaving activity. maintaining a function that seems to be superfluous raises the possibility that this protease might have an extra unknown biological function."}
