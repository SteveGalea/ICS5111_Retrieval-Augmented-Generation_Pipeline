{"summary": "there is no quarantine time that will provide assurance of no residual risk from contagion. if an individual manifests progress into a contagious state, subsequent confinement may occur until the contagiousness ends. if an individual manifests progress into a contagious state, subsequent confinement may occur until the contagiousness ends. this was discussed in the context of the SARS coronavirus outbreak7. both authors noted the importance of the distributional form in assessing the upper tail probability, and the influence that data truncation may have on such estimates. to make use this approach, an acceptable residual risk needs to be set. a formal decision analytic approach to deducing the optimal quarantine time may be devised. prior knowledge on Ebola incubation time distributions Breman et al.11 did a detailed analysis of the 1976 Zaire outbreak. 49 Lekone and Finkenstadt15 analyzed the 1995 Congo outbreak. their analysis yielded a larger value for the mean incubation time. their approach used an informative prior and thus an implied exponential distribution. smallpox Nishiura18 discussed the use of the upper 95th percentile of the incubation time distribution. if the estimated incubation time distributions for the Congo outbreak are used, this would suggest a quarantine time of as high as 31 days. but the set point (95th, 99th, etc.) for a decision making needs to be based on balancing costs and benefits. would need to explicitly consider the costs and benefits involved in various alternatives. would include explicit computations from transmission modeling."}
