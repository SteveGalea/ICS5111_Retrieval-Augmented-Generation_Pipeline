{"summary": "IAV elicits strong adaptive immune responses, but it is prone to rapid genomic variation either through small incremental mutations or major changes resulting from exchange of genome segments with those of animal strains. the presence of animal reservoirs allows introduction of avian or pig strains into humans resulting in pandemics. AMPs are attractive as potential therapies for IAV because they have antiviral and antibacterial activity and also exert immunomodulatory effects. there are two major classes of AMPs present in human respiratory lining fluids: defensins and cathelicidins. -defensins are expressed predominantly by epithelial cells. they are relevant in particular to IAV since they are expressed by the respiratory epithelium. the mechanisms of antiviral activity of HNPs have not been fully elucidated. -defensins and IAV Human -defensins (HBDs) are produced by respiratory epithelial cells constitutively or in response to inflammatory stimuli. the HBDs are less potent as direct inhibitors of IAV than the HNPs. however, they may have important immunomodulatory roles during IAV infection. potential for paradoxical activity of Defensins HD5 and HD6 have been found to promote infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro by increasing viral entry [20]. no studies have indicated promotion of infection of IAV by defensins. LL-37 resembles HNPs in that it is packaged in neutrophil granules. leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been shown to promote defense against IAV. LL-37 has been found to inhibit several viruses including IAV, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and HIV. LL-37 has direct antiviral activity against IAV. histones are cationic peptides that resemble AMPs in some regards. there is increasing evidence that histones serve a host defense role vs. various organisms. histones are also found in cytosol and extracellular fluids. A peptides are similar to the porcine AMP, protegrin, in ability to form channels in membrane structures. this is believed to be one of the anti-bacterial and antifungal mechanisms of AMPs. one group of -defensins is packaged in neutrophil granules. these are termed human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) 1\u20134. the HNPs are very likely to interact with IAV in vivo. -defensins and IAV Human -defensins (HBDs) are produced by respiratory epithelial cells constitutively or in response to inflammatory stimuli. the HBDs are less potent as direct inhibitors of IAV than the HNPs. however, they may have important immunomodulatory roles during IAV infection as well. retrocyclins and other defensins can induce aggregation of IAV. they appear to have stronger intrinsic antiviral activity than HNPs. there is evidence that retrocyclins can act as lectins binding to viral carbohydrates. fensins is potentiated by formation of multimolecular assemblies of defensins [8,13,14] this may help to account for viral aggregating activity of defensins. mice do not have neutrophil -defensins but have other antimicrobial peptides that may play similar role. LL-37 and Influenza A distinct group of antimicrobial peptides is called the cathelicidins and the one representative of this class in humans is LL-37. LL-37 resembles HNPs in that it is packaged in neutrophil granules and released upon activation. LL-37 is also displayed on NETs where it can interact with IAV. LL-37 has been found to inhibit several viruses including IAV, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and HIV. LL-37 has direct antiviral activity against IAV and contributes to host defense against the virus in vivo. histones are cationic peptides that resemble AMPs in some regards. there is increasing evidence that histones serve a host defense role vs. various organisms. A peptides are similar to the porcine AMP, protegrin, in ability to form channels in membrane structures. this is believed to be one of the anti-bacterial and antifungal mechanisms of AMPs. s Histones are cationic peptides that resemble AMPs in some regards. they are known for their ability to bind to and regulate expression of DNA. however, they are also found in cytosol and extracellular fluids. A peptides are similar to the porcine AMP, protegrin, in ability to form channels in membrane structures. this is believed to be one of the anti-bacterial and antifungal mechanisms of AMPs. immunomodulation b Defensin Neutrophil Seasonal strains: 3+ Pandemic strains: 1+ Neutrophils: increased viral uptake, reduced H2O2 response Monocytes: cytokines reduced Defensin Not present in humans Seasonal strains: 4+ Pandemic strains: ND Neutrophils: increased viral uptake Monocytes: cytokines reduced LL-37 Neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells Seasonal retrocyclins, histones and A1-42 increase viral uptake by neutrophils. LL-37 did not alter viral uptake by neutrophils. LL-37 has several known receptors on phagocytes. LL-37 treatment of mice infected with IAV reduces cytokine responses. this effect appeared independent of reduction of viral load by LL-37 in vivo. the relevance of these findings to IAV infection has not been evaluated thus far. the injection of histones into mice can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g. IL-6, IL-8 and TNF) and leukocyte infiltration, resulting in sepsis-like pathology. further study is needed to determine how to best administer AMPs in vivo and whether possible pro-inflammatory effects would be harmful. LL-37 facilitates presentation of antigens to by DCs to T cells [48,72]. -defensins have been shown to potentiate neutralizing antibody responses to enteric viral infection. AMPs are a major contributor to mortality during pandemics and seasonal epidemics of IAV. retrocyclins and LL-37 had additive antiviral effects when combined with SP-D [8,34] there is evidence that other host defense proteins can bind histones and modulate their potential adverse effects. evidence suggests that SP-D can simultaneously bind to both pathogens and NETs. LL-37 stimulates a respiratory burst response characterized by H2O2 production. histones, A1-42, and LL-37 potentiated the response. LL-37 has several known receptors on phagocytes, including formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and CXCR2. HNPs released from dying neutrophils have been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory effects. they can be taken up by macrophages during bacterial infection. deletion of HBD-1 resulted in greater inflammatory reaction to IAV. the injection of histones into mice can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release (e.g. IL-6, IL-8 and TNF) and leukocyte infiltration, resulting in sepsis-like pathology. further study is needed to investigate the role of histones during severe IAV and IAV-related lung injury. the role of AMPs in bacterial superinfection, or for possible treatment of bacterial superinfection, has not been studied. however, the activity of AMPs in vivo reflects complex interactions between various AMPs and other host defense molecules. AMPs 1-3 bind to the lung host defense and surfactant regulatory protein, surfactant protein D (SP-D) SP-D can bind to histones and inhibit histone-induced respiratory burst in neutrophils. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant, is another host defense protein that is usually elevated during infections or inflammation. other proteins like thrombomodulin have similar effects. provirins retained the properties of viral aggregation and increasing viral uptake by neutrophils. unlike retrocyclins, they did not interfere with the viral neutralizing activity of SP-D. the most active hapivirins and diprovirins also had strong ability to suppress TNF generation by humans. amino acid fragment of mBD4 (termed P9 by the authors) was found to have activity exceeding that of the full 40 amino acid protein. 100% of mice survived lethal challenge with a mouse adapted H1N1 viral strain when they were pretreated with 50 g/mouse of P9 intranasally. the P9 peptide also reduced lung inflammation and viral loads in the mice. pandemic H1N1 of 2009 was inhibited in vitro by GI-20, but not by LL-37 or the other peptides. GI-20 also retained the ability of LL-37 to increase neutrophil respiratory burst and NET responses to the virus. GI-20 also suppressed neutrophil IL-8 response to the virus. the antiviral activity of lactoferrin was related to binding to the HA2 subunit of the viral hemagglutinin (which contains the fusion domain) a 27 amino acid N-terminal fragment of human BPI was recently shown to inhibit various IAV strains in vitro through a direct action on the virus. the peptides retained the properties of viral aggregation and increasing viral uptake by neutrophils. the retrocyclins did not interfere with the viral neutralizing activity of SP-D. the most active hapivirins and diprovirins also had strong ability to suppress TNF generation by monocytes. 100% of mice survived lethal challenge with a mouse adapted H1N1 viral strain when they were pretreated with 50 g/mouse of P9 intranasally. the peptide also reduced lung inflammation and viral loads in the mice. demic H1N1 of 2009 was inhibited in vitro by GI-20, but not by LL-37 or the other peptides. GI-20 also retained the ability of LL-37 to increase neutrophil respiratory burst and NET responses to the virus. GI-20 also suppressed neutrophil IL-8 response to the virus. a 27 amino acid N-terminal fragment of human BPI was recently shown to inhibit various IAV strains in vitro through a direct action on the virus. of interest, the murine homolog of this peptide lacked anti-IAV activity. the human peptide inhibited IL-6 and TNF responses of monocytes triggered by IAV. LL-37 generation by epithelial cells is regulated by vitamin D. LL-37 generation is also enhanced by histone deacetylase inhibitors. supplementation with the amino acid isoleucine can increase HBD expression. resistance to two classes of drugs currently used for IAV treatment has been emerging. deaths caused by IAV infection mostly resulted from acute lung injury, systemic inflammation or bacterial superinfection. new treatments with anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammation effects would be ideal."}
