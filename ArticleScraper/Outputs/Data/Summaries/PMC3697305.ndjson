{"summary": "fewer than 200 of the approximately 1400 pathogen species recognized to infect humans are viruses. more than two new species of viruses infecting humans are reported worldwide every year,9 most of which are likely to be RNA viruses. agic diseases caused by hantaviruses, arenaviruses and dengue viruses must be overcome in the national and international capacity for early detection, rapid and accurate etiological identification (especially those caused by novel pathogens) the diagnostic laboratory plays a central role in identifying the etiological agent causing an outbreak and provides timely, accurate information required to guide control measures. emerging infectious diseases are divided into four categories based on the nature and characteristics of infectious agents that cause the emerging infections. these categories are summarized in Table 1. Emerging infectious diseases are categorized based on the nature and characteristics of infectious agents that cause the emerging infections. subcategory 1a covers known pathogens that occur in new ecological niches/geographical areas. infectious microbes/agents placed under this subcategory are better known as 'opportunistic' pathogens. the increased susceptibility of human hosts to infectious agents is due to the HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic. a notable example is the increased incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. microbial drugs, ecological and host-driven microbial mixing, genetic drift or re-assortment and environmental selection are included in this category. most, if not all, novel pathogens under this category are spillovers of zoonotic pathogens. these spillovers are directly or indirectly due to increased frequency of mixing at the interface between wild-life animal reservoirs carrying the \u2018novel\u2019 zoonotic pathogens and humans or peri-domestic animals new human polyomaviruses (KI, WU), novel orthoreoviruses (Melaka virus, Kampar virus, HK23629/07) and Saffold virus are examples of infectious diseases under category 4b. effective early detection, identification, characterization, containment, control and ultimately prevention of emerging infectious diseases will require a good, functional national public health surveillance system. national reference laboratory should be able to conduct research for the development of new diagnostic technologies to detect and identify novel pathogens. the system includes local and state public health laboratories that conduct diagnoses of known pathogens, especially those classified as category 4. the problem is compounded by policy makers and laboratory managers lacking flexibility and not allowing these disease or pathogen-specific laboratories to adopt a more generic approach. public health analytical diagnostic laboratories (both primary and clinical) should adopt a generic approach and serve as the initial or first entry point for the investigation of the causative pathogens in the event of an infectious disease outbreak or the occurrence of any fatal illness with clinical suspicion of infectious etiology. public health laboratories must have the capability to support the expanded scope and sophistication of public health activities brought about by a rapid increase in population and social, demographic and ecological changes. the proposed model can be appropriately modified to tailor each country's immediate needs. it is recommended that all countries establish an integrated system covering all three categories of public health laboratories. in countries with limited resources, an interim centralized national public health reference laboratory can take on some of the roles and functions of a national laboratory. a national reference laboratory will also be able to play an important role as part of a regional laboratory network to strengthen regional public health laboratory capacity. public health research laboratories within the research institutes of ministries of health and universities or even private research institutions are best suited. proposed network scheme will provide more cost-efficient laboratory services and ensure a regular flow of laboratory work to maintain technical staff to produce quality output."}
