{"summary": "polyethylenimine (PEI), as a kind of cationic polymer, has been extensively applied as a nucleotide delivery reagent for decades. in recent years, the robust adjuvanticity of PEI has been continuously documented. in recent years, the robust adjuvanticity of PEI has been continuously documented. we first introduce the physicochemical properties of PEI and its general applications in distinct areas. branched PEI, which contains primary, secondary and tertiary amine groups, can be synthesized through the cationic ring-opening polymerization of aziridine. branched PEI, however, includes secondary amines only, commonly derived from acidic hydrolysis of polyoxazoline (Figure 1D and E) the toxicity of PEI.5 Figure 1.

PEI is the second acceptable nonviral nucleic acid transfer agent, besides poly-L-lysine (PLL). besides nucleic acids, proteins or peptides are also included in the category. PEI/modified PEI as vaccine adjuvants are quite competent in treating infections or tumors. intracellular process of PEI/modified PEI as vaccine adjuvants is highly desirable. PEI could be incorporated into vaccine structures through different ways. the strong positive charge in PEI is beneficial for cellular internalization. the loosely organized PEI in neat state will disturb the actin remodeling when initiating the internalization. however, PEI compresses negative substances to condense small particles. maltosylated PEI-mediated vaccines for cervical cancers were more effective than neat human papillomavirus antigens. receptor-mediated endocytosis of PEI-based particles by maltose enhanced transfection efficiency. hydrophobic modification of alkyl chains to PEI vaccines optimized cross-presentation of antigens and upregulated IL-2 secretion. however, correlation between the properties of the synthesized hydrophobic-modified PEI and the vaccine potency still needs further investigation. PEI-based vaccines provide the opportunities to synthesize multiple antigens in APCs and stimulate effective cellular immunity and long-lasting memory immunity. however, most DNA is actually delivered to bystander cells. phagocytosed or endocytosed antigens escape from the vacuole and gain entry to the cytosol (known as the \u201clysosomal escape\u201d) they become qualified clients for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. ATP-mediated pH-dependent proton pumps open, followed by passive influx of chloride ions and water molecules causing the vesicles to burst. the vesicles containing the PEI-based complex met with a sudden burst while letting out the contents throughout the cytoplasm. they prepared the PEI/ribozyme group with bafilomycin A, a selective inhibitor of endosomal/lysosomal acidification. the process has recently been verified again by Song et al. intracellular pro cessing of poly(ethylene imine)/ribozyme complexes can be observed in living cells by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. a group of membrane-destabilizing peptides have shown the possibility of not only promoting cell uptake but also improving \u201clysosomal escape\u201d and even nuclear translocation. arginine-rich derivatives of PEI induced higher DNA and siRNA transfection efficiency than the groups without modifications. arginine-rich derivatives of PEI induced higher DNA transfection efficiency than the groups without modifications. I-based vaccines related to antigen uptake and presentation are illustrated in Figure 4. positive charge, round shape and controllable size of PEI-based MPs and NPs are all benefits contributing to the uptake process. they could be modified with PRR ligands, hydrophobic moieties or CPPs. PEI-based vaccines have been processed into clinical level. we summarize the application of PEI-based vaccines in animal experiments against infections and cancers in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. gene encoding three Ags of L. monocytogenes Better survival rate of mice immunized with a sublethal dose of L. monocytogenes than naked DNA L. monocytogenes 77 5 22-kDa, 25-kDa or 87-kDa LPEI or JetPEI/DNA NPs Balb/c and C57BL/6J i.m. in PB, no Abs are detected; with DTH on skin HIV 73 8 PLGA MPs containing PEI/DNA complexes Balb/c i.m.

PEI-coated AuNRs induced a higher level of maturation of DCs. the immune-promoting effects almost matched LPS to some extent. the subsequent activation of specific immunization and the interferon production were strictly Env-dependent. gene expression profiles of in vivo immunization of mice with PEI were investigated. compared with control group, immuno-related genes of two injected groups were activated at considerably high levels regardless of the antigens. cationic polymers (such as cationic dextrans and PEI) promoted the maturation of macrophages via TLR4 and secreted type-I cytokines. cationic dextran and PEI have also been found to repolarize myeloid-derived suppressor cells into the antitumor phenotype. the PEI/DNA vaccines were much more effective than naked DNA vaccines in antitumor trial. the co-cultivation of PEI with BMDCs in vitro revealed the activation and expression of important nuclear translocation factors (such as NF-B p50 and p65) the NLRP3 inflammasome is among the nod-like receptors (NLRs) it was known to be activated by various stresses, including K+ efflux, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lysosome rupture. NLRP3 inflammasome function only biased adaptive immunity toward a Th2 response, instead of affecting the overall PEI adjuvant activity. many nonpathogenic adjuvants, including PEI, are toxic to tissues. many nonpathogenic adjuvants, including PEI, are toxic to tissues. the specific role and relationship with other immunity-related molecules still merit further investigations. bare PEI upregulated expressions of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis and differentiation. toxicity from adjuvants would affect the cell states to exhibit various activities, which will impair the outcome of overall effects of PEI. particles in different research are generalized and drawn out by our own understanding. both TLRs and NLRs are receptors in APCs that recognize the danger signals. some nontoxic biomaterials also have profound effects on immune cells. only five adjuvants have been licensed for use in clinical applications. aluminum is the most widely used adjuvant in vaccination for almost one century. only a few adjuvants have been licensed for cancer immunotherapy. PEI confers the ability to induce the \u201cdanger signals\u201d of immune cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. biodistribution and biodegradation of PEI-based vaccines in vivo still need further investigation."}
