{"summary": "Vaccination is the most efficient tool for preventing a variety of infectious diseases. the ultimate goal of vaccination is to generate a pathogen-specific immune response providing long-lasting protection against infection (2). despite the significant success of vaccines, development of safe and strong vaccines is still required due to new pathogens. inactivated vaccines elicit humoral immunity, with little to no induction of CMI. purified or recombinant subunit vaccines derived from non-living vaccine antigens are poorly immunogenic. subunit vaccines have been made for hepatitis B virus, influenza virus (injection) and pertussis. use for human vaccines by mixing with aluminium salts (alum) but new vaccine targets will require strong antibody responses but also robust CMI including T helper (Th) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) the use of appropriate adjuvants will allow for vaccine formulations that selectively trigger innate immunity. aluminium salts are the most widely used adjuvants in human vaccines. aluminium salts are the most widely used adjuvants in human vaccines. alum adjuvants have been used in practical vaccination for more than 80 years. known mechanism of action of alum is the \"depot effect\" first proposed by Glenny in 1925. depot formation was cited to facilitate continuous antigen release from injection site. advantages of alum are high safety record, antigen stabilization and augmentation of high and long-lasting antibody titer. MF59 generates high antibody titers with balanced IgG1:IgG2a responses. AS03 is included in licensed H5N1 and H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. studies have reported a possible association between narcolepsy and the use of AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine. osomes are able to induce both humoral immunity and CMI (25,26) major advantages of using virosomes in vaccines are: 1) high quality and long-lasting antibody responses, 2) conformational stabilization of antigen, 3) protection of antigen from degradation, 5) excellent safety profile, 5) suitability to specific populations such as infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. aluminium salts are the most widely used adjuvants in human vaccines. aluminium salts are the most widely used adjuvants in human vaccines. alum adjuvants have been used in practical vaccination for more than 80 years. depot formation is not required for alum adjuvanticity (12,13,14) alum has been shown to facilitate humoral immunity via Th2 type immune responses (IgG1, IgE, IL-4, IL-5 and eosinophil) the advantages of alum are high safety record, antigen stabilization and augmentation of high and long-lasting antibody titer. MF59 is included in licensed H5N1 and H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. both MF59 and AS03 contain squalene oil but have different compositions. MPL, a TLR4 agonist, is a chemically detoxified derivative of the parent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella Minnesota R595 strain (28). two AS04-adjuvanted vaccines are licensed for human use: the HPV vaccine (Cervarix) and HBV vaccine (Fendrix) for haemodialised patients (31,32). all adjuvants listed in Table III are known as \"immunostimulators\" or \"immune potentiators\" a recent study showed that the antigen and AS04 should be co-localized in lymph nodes. a new class of effective vaccine adjuvant is based on the TLR pathway. TLR 3, 5 and 9 are in clinical trials of vaccines against infectious pathogens. unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) enhance antigen-specific immune responses. flagellin fusion proteins are suitable adjuvants for the development of vaccines to induce robust antigen-specific immune responses. a flagellin/ hemagglutinin-based vaccine (VAX128) and a flagellin/matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) vaccine (VAX102) are in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza. AS03 and AS04 have been approved as adjuvants in several human vaccines. AS01 induces biased Th2 type immune responses, but AS02 induces high antibody titer and dominant Th1 type immune responses owing to the addition of MPL. a new class of effective vaccine adjuvant is based on the TLR pathway. we will focus on TLR 3, 5 and 9 which are in clinical trials of vaccines against infectious pathogens. unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides enhance antigen-specific immune responses. a flagellin/ hemagglutinin-based vaccine (VAX128) and a flagellin/matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) vaccine (VAX102) are in clinical trials of vaccines against influenza (38, 39) the adjuvant properties of ISCOM and ISCOMMATRIX are currently being evaluated in clinical trials of influenza. AS03 and AS04 have been approved as adjuvants in several human vaccines. AS01 induces biased Th2 type immune responses, but AS02 induces dominant Th1 type immune responses owing to the addition of MPL. the ultimate goal of vaccination is to generate potent and long-term protection against diseases. a panel of novel immunostimulant adjuvants will be used for human vaccine formulations in a near future."}
