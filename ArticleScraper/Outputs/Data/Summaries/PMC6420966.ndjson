{"summary": "inflammation is a multicomponent response to injury, tissue stress, and infection, associated with most diseases. there are two main categories of anti-inflammatory drugs: steroidal drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) NSAID is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. MC had potential NF-B inhibitory activity and clinical anti-inflammatory efficacy. previous studies primarily focused on the single component. ation MC was acquired from the anguo Chinese herbal medicine market. the dried MC was crushed into powder, weighing the powder accurately. add methanol (W/V=1:20), ultrasonic extraction of 30 min at 25\u00b0C, centrifuge and collect the supernatant. Dex was used as a positive control and could decrease expression of NF-B in HEK 293 cells. UPLC-Q/TOF-MS Analysis A waters Acquity UPLC system was used to analyze samples. the sample and extraction cone voltage were 30 V and 4.0 V. the flow rate of the desolvation gas was 600 L/h at a desolvation temperature of 350\u00b0C. a flow rate was set at 20 l/min. chemicals and reagents Gallic acid, paeonol, and paeoniflorin were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) dexamethasone (Dex) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a thermostatic incubator. their culture conditions were the same as those of HEK 293 cells, except for DMEM/F-12 (HAM) 1:1 instead of DMEM high glucose. the chromatographic column was an Acquity BEH C18-column. the flow rate was 0.40 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 30\u00b0C. the optimal mobile phase was composed of A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) the MS spectra scanning range in the wide-pass mode was 50 Da to 1200 Da. leucine enkephalin amide acetate (LEA, 200 ng/mL) was used as the lock mass. a flow rate was set at 20 l/min. SPSS v.18.0 statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago USA) was used for statistical analysis. results with values of P 0.05 were considered statistically significant. we analyzed the seven fractions, and compounds they contain were identified by exact molecular weights and diagnostic fragment ions. the detailed results and MS/MS information were shown in Table 1. oxypaeoniflora C23H28O12 495.1476 [M-H] 465 [M-H-CH2O] 137 [M-H-C6H11O6-C10H12O3] 3 8.69 paeoniflorin C23H28O11 479.1545 [M-H] 525 [M+HCOO]- 449 [M-H-HCHO] 327 [M-H-HCHO-C7 paeoniflorin, the mother nucleus of the four compounds, was selected as a representative component to study their anti-inflammatory activity. gallic acid, paeoniflorin, and paeonol all showed significant NF-B inhibitory effects. values are presented as the mean SEM; n=5 per group. ### P 0.001 compared to the control group; P 0.05, P 0.01, P 0.001 compared to the model group. MC contained some components with potential anti-inflammatory activity. we analyzed the seven fractions, and compounds they contain were identified by exact molecular weights and diagnostic fragment ions. the detailed results and MS/MS information were shown in Table 1. oxypaeoniflora C23H28O12 495.1476 [M-H] 465 [M-H-CH2O] 137 [M-H-C6H11O6-C10H12O3] 3 8.69 paeoniflorin C23H28O11 479.1545 [M-H] 525 [M+HCOO]- 449 [M-H-HCHO] 327 [M-H-HCHO-C7 paeoniflorin, the mother nucleus of the four compounds, was selected as a representative component to study their anti-inflammatory activity. gallic acid, paeoniflorin, and paeonol all showed significant NF-B inhibitory effects. values are presented as the mean SEM; n=5 per group. ### P 0.001 compared to the control group; P 0.05, P 0.01, P 0.001 compared to the model group. NF-B inhibitory activity of galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, and mudanoside C has not been reported in previous studies. these compounds could inhibit the activation of NF-B induced by TNF-a and could be considered as novel NF-B inhibitors. oxypaeoniflorin, paeoniflorin, galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, mudanpioside C, gallic acid, and paeonol were related to the anti-inflammatory effect of MC. MC showed significant efficacy in inhibiting NF-B activation. LC-Q/TOF which contain both chemical and bioactive details is suitable for screening active ingredients from natural medicines."}
