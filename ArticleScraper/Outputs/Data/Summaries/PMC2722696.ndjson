{"summary": "most sore throats are self limiting5 and are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. group A -haemolytic streptococcus responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15\u201330% of those in children. ised controlled trials comparing systemic corticosteroids with placebo. included studies of patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation. we did sensitivity analyses, excluding each study in turn, to determine the stability of the effect. sensitivity analyses included age, route of corticosteroid, presence of positive bacterial culture or direct antigen test, and severity of sore throat. pharyngitis (inflammation of the tonsils or oropharynx) and patients with a clinical syndrome of \u201csore throat\u201d (painful throat, odynophagia) we excluded studies of infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess. we did sensitivity analyses, excluding each study in turn, to determine the stability of the effect. sensitivity analyses included age, route of corticosteroid, presence of positive bacterial culture or direct antigen test, and severity of sore throat. study included 743 patients (369 children, 374 adults) 348 (47%) had exudative sore throat. 330 (44%) were positive for group A -haemolytic

pain relief occurred at an average of 6.3 hours earlier with corticosteroids than without. meta-regression analysis revealed no significant differences in mean time to onset of pain relief. effect on

antibiotics to both intervention and placebo groups and allowed simple analgesia use. significant effects were recorded in adult patients only (relative risk 4.3, 2.3 to 8.1, P0.001)w1 w6 w7 and in those receiving oral corticosteroids only (2.6, 1.6 to 4.3, P0.001). results were similar in trials with adult patients only (1.8, 1.3 to 2.3, P0.001)w1 w7. corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief in hours. all three categories of sore throat (exudative, bacterial pathogen positive, and severe) were significant (P0.001) with no heterogeneity (I2=0) three studies showed a benefit of corticosteroids,w5 w7 w8 and two showed non-significant effects in opposing directions. time to complete resolution ranged from 15 to 45 hours in corticosteroid group and 35 to 54 hours in the placebo group. only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline. the effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours. the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect. the use of corticosteroids will triple the likelihood of resolution at 24 hours and hasten this resolution by more than 6 hours. the use of corticosteroids will triple the likelihood of resolution at 24 hours. the use of corticosteroids will triple the likelihood of resolution at 24 hours. trials should include number of patients who have resolution of symptoms at 24, 48, 72 hours and standardised pain scores. use of Centor criteria at baseline will facilitate classification of severity. further research should focus on the effects of corticosteroids on antibiotic use. corticosteroids reduce the time to mean onset of pain relief in this patient group by about 6 hours. the effect of corticosteroids independent of antibiotics is unknown and should be the focus of future research. current practice is to assess the effects of corticosteroids on sore throat symptoms. patients with severe or high Centor scoring sore throat would benefit from a single dose of corticosteroids. the use of corticosteroids will triple the likelihood of resolution at 24 hours and hasten this resolution by more than 6 hours. however, the decision to use any treatment involves balancing the benefit and potential harms of the therapy. corticosteroids are beneficial for symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections Sore throat is a common condition in primary care Recent guidelines recommend that antibiotics should not be prescribed for sore throat. the effect of corticosteroids independent of antibiotics is unknown. patients with severe sore throat who are given corticosteroids are three times more likely to report complete resolution of symptoms than those who do not receive corticosteroids. corticosteroids also reduce the time to mean onset of pain relief by about 6 hours."}
