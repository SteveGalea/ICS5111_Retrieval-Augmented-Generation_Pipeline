{"summary": "community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to the pneumonia acquired outside a hospital or in a long-term care institution. it has an annual incidence rate of around 2%, according to research from many domestic and foreign scholars. if a clinician did not consider the position of the CAP virus, he probably would not consider the diagnosis of viral pneumonia. study was undertaken by collecting clinical data of 19 diagnosed adenovirus pneumonia immunocompetent patients. adenovirus pneumonia accounted for a large proportion of adenovirus pneumonia. adenovirus pneumonia accounted for a large proportion of adenovirus pneumonia. multiplex PCR The pharyngeal swabs (167KS01, Guangzhou, China) of initially diagnosed CAP patients were sampled and placed into 2 mL virus-transporting media (maintained at 2-8\u00b0C) after transportation, the samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. the collected swabs were then shocked for 5 s and centrifuged at 3000 r/5 min. the kit determination series included the adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; influenza B virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, 4; respiratory syncytial virus type A and B; coronavirus types 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1; rhinovirus; bocavirus; and enterovirus. multiplex PCR The pharyngeal swabs (167KS01, Guangzhou, China) of initially diagnosed CAP patients were sampled and placed into 2 mL virus-transporting media (maintained at 2-8\u00b0C) after transportation, the samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. the collected swabs were then shocked for 5 s and centrifuged at 3000 r/5 min. the kit determination series included the adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; influenza A virus; influenza B virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, 4; respiratory syncytial virus type A and B; coronavirus types 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1; rhinovirus; bocavirus; and enterovirus. there were 2 patients suffering from hypertension and coronary heart disease, respectively. the basic information of all the patients involved in this study was no.
