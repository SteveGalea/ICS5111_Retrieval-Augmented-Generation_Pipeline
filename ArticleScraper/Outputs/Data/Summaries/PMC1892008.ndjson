{"summary": "this paper reanalyzes the temporal distribution of pandemic influenza in Prussia, Germany, from 1918\u201319 using the daily numbers of deaths. the daily numbers of deaths totaled 8911 from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919, and the distribution of the time delay from onset to death in order to estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt. pandemic influenza is characterized by severe pulmonary pathology due to the highly virulent nature of the viral strain and the host immune response against it. the threat of recent avian influenza epidemics is causing widespread public concern. a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of Spanish flu is crucial in offering insight into control strategies. only a few studies have assessed the time course of the pandemic. it is plausible that the contact frequency leading to infection varied considerably with time owing to the huge number of deaths and dissemination of information through local media (e.g. newspapers and posters) the daily number of influenza deaths from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919 was used in the following analyses. the temporal distribution of influenza deaths was transformed to the daily incidence (i.e. the daily case onset) using the time delay distribution from onset to death given in the same records. time from disease onset (i.e. fever) to death is given for 6233 influenza deaths. a simple 5-day moving average was applied to the original data. a time-inhomogeneous evaluation was performed. the expected values of R(t) fell below 1 very close to the end of the epidemic. in this stage, estimates assuming a short serial interval exhibited wide uncertainty bounds, reflecting stochasticity due to the small number of cases. Table 1 shows recently reported estimates of R0 during the fall wave of Spanish flu according to the estimated magnitude of transmissibility. two studies (in the UK [7] and New Zealand [13] were based on model assumptions. the reported estimates of R0 roughly correspond to the assumed length of the serial interval described above. three pandemic waves were simultaneously fitted assuming a large number of susceptible individuals but the statistical details were not given. simulation results obtained assuming serial intervals of 1 and 5 days also reflected the observed epidemic curve reasonably. the 95% confidence intervals were determined by 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated cases and deaths at each time point. the temporal distribution of influenza deaths was transformed to the daily incidence (i.e. the daily case onset) using the time delay distribution from onset to death given in the same records. time variations in the transmission potential Figure 3 shows time variations in the estimated effective reproduction numbers obtained assuming three different serial intervals (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 days) compared with the corresponding epidemic curve. epidemic date 0 represents 9 September 1918 when the back-calculated onset of cases initially yielded a value the nearest integer of which was 1. estimates assuming a short serial interval exhibited wide uncertainty bounds. serial interval assumed to be 1 (second from the top), 3 (lower middle) and 5 days (bottom) days are counted from September 9, 1918, onwards. two studies were based on model assumptions and a specific setting different from those in other countries. the first is the relationship between R0 and the serial interval described above. the reported estimates of R0 roughly correspond to the assumed length of the serial interval. simulation results obtained assuming serial intervals of 1 and 5 days reflected the observed epidemic curve reasonably. predicted values of influenza cases and deaths overlapped with the observed numbers (dot) deaths were determined by 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated cases. the present study showed that reasonable estimates of R(t) can be inferred using a far simpler method without assuming the number of susceptible individuals. despite this, it is remarkable that differences in R(t) were obtained using the assumed serial interval lengths employed in the present study. the finding implies that it is critically important to clarify details of the natural history of a disease in order to offer robust assessments. non-monotonic decline in R(t) could reflect (i) heterogeneous patterns of transmission and/or (ii) other time-dependent underlying factors. if age-related transmission patterns yield time variations in age-specific incidence, the decline in R(t) could partly be attributable to age-related heterogeneity. high estimates of R0 likely to originate from fitting an autonomous model to the entire epidemic curve. non-pharmaceutical individual countermeasures are crucial for poor resource settings. non-pharmaceutical individual countermeasures are crucial for poor resource settings, especially in developing countries. death data were collected from 28 different local districts surrounding the town of Arnsberg. 61,824 cases, 1609 deaths were observed, yielding a case fatality estimate of 2.60% (95% CI: 2.48, 2.73) serial interval distribution, g(), is a slightly different expression of a method proposed for SARS [15]. the advantages of this model include: (i) we only need to know the time of onset of cases (i.e. the model does not require the total number of susceptible individuals or detailed contact information) incorporating variations in the number of secondary transmissions generated by each case into the same generation. the model can be formalized using a discrete-time branching process. the model is conventionally assumed to model the offspring distribution. data Medical officers in Prussia recorded the daily number of influenza deaths from 29 September 1918 to 1 February 1919. a total of 8911 deaths were reported during the fall wave. the model reasonably cancels out the effect of p assuming that the conditional probability of death given infection is independent of time. the effective reproduction number at time t, R(t), can be back-calculated using the incidence, C(t) and serial interval distribution, g(), of length. cases in each generation, C1, C2, C3,..., Cn are given by C0R0, C1R1, C2R2,..., Cn-1Rn-1 and also by C0R0, C0R0R1, C0R0R1, C0R0R1R2,..., L = constant j = 0 N 1 ( C j R j ) C j + 1 exp ( C j R j ). e. 1, 3 and 5 days were assumed for equation (5) with respect to the observed data. for each length, the daily number of cases was grouped by the determined serial interval length. this simple model assumes a homogeneous pattern of spread. death during the influenza epidemic in Prussia, Germany, from 1918\u201319. author thanks Klaus Dietz for useful discussions."}
