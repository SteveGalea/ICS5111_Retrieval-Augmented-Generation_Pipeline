{"summary": "the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are recently recognized ISGs with antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses (1, 2). Originally identified in a cDNA screen of genes upregulated by type I interferons, their antiviral properties have since been well characterized in vitro (3, 4). iquitination at conserved lysine residues (14) and tyrosine phosphorylation (15) also have been identified as contributors to IFITM3 cellular localization and antiviral function. IFITM3 alone is responsible for between 40 and 70% of the antiviral activity of type I interferon against IAV. the natural host may be infected with all strains of IAV with little to no disease symptoms. sporadic infections can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. ducks greatly upregulate ISGs following infection with highly pathogenic IAV. length duck IFITM coding sequences were amplified from cDNA. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) each product subsequently was cloned to incorporate an N-terminal V5 tag into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro+ (Invitrogen) gene expression analysis was performed using 7500 Fast System software v1.4 (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (28) gene expression analysis was performed using qPCR, analyzing the expression of each overexpressed duck IFITM relative to that of its respective chicken IFITM. chimeric proteins swapping the N-terminal domains of dIFITM1 and dIFITM3 were generated by overlap extension PCR. PCR products of the N terminus of dIFITM1 and the CD225 domain of dIFITM3 were combined. a final PCR was performed to create full-length chimeric proteins. all chimeric proteins and point mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro+. DF-1 chicken fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM. cell lysates were boiled in 1 Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using mouse anti-V5 antibody (Life Technologies) at 1:5,000. goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at 1:5,000. the cells were stained with anti-nucleoprotein-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Argene) for 1 h. the cells then were stained with FITC (Argene) for 1 h. rVSV-GFP-positive cells were visualized directly. the cellular location of each duck IFITM was determined by staining with rabbit anti-V5 conjugated to Dylight650 (ab117489; Abcam) chicken endosomes were stained using a mouse anti-LEP100 antibody (LEP100 IgG; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) the nuclei of cells were stained using a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Sequences were analyzed using BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) each product subsequently was cloned to incorporate an N-terminal V5 tag into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro+. a maximum likelihood tree of IFITMs was generated using PhyML with 100 bootstrap replications (30). the specificity of primers and probes was confirmed against a panel of cloned IFITM genes. the specificity of primers and probes was confirmed against a panel of cloned genes. chimeric proteins swapping the N-terminal domains of dIFITM1 and dIFITM3 were generated by overlap extension PCR. chimeric proteins swapping the N-terminal domains of dIFITM1 and dIFITM3 were generated by overlap extension PCR. DF-1 chicken fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) for transfections, cells were seeded overnight in 96-well plates (3 104 cells) and 24 h later were transfected with 0.2 g of plasmid DNA/well using 0.5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at 1:5,000 (Bio-Rad) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (0.1 g/ml) infected DF-1 cells were harvested using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. the percentage of FITC- or GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. s were stained using a mouse anti-LEP100 antibody (LEP100 IgG; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) the nuclei of cells were stained with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (A-11001; Thermo Scientific). RESULTS Characterization of the duck IFITM repertoire. FITM2 and dIFITM3 have 41%, 68%, and 76% amino acid identity to the chicken orthologs. the predicted nonimmune dIFITM5 has 91% and 63% identity to CD225 of chicken and human IFITM3 respectively. duck IFITM1 has a unique insertion in exon 1 not seen in chicken IFITM1. human IFITM1 and IFITM2 genes are in a transcriptional orientation that is the opposite of that of duck or chicken. we have identified four duck IFITM genes in the same order and orientation as those of the chicken orthologues. duck IFITMs are upregulated in response to influenza A virus infection. dIFITM1 was highly upregulated by 370-fold at 1 day postinfection (dpi) dIFITM1 also was upregulated 43-fold and 11-fold at 1 and 3 dpi with BC500. expression of both dIFITM2 and dIFITM3 was only modestly upregulated 4-fold at 3 dpi with VN1203 and 2-fold and 3-fold at 1 dpi with BC500. total RNA was isolated from duck lung tissue 1 and 3 days postinfection with PBS (mock), BC500 (low-pathogenicity IAV) expression was measured using qPCR and compared to that of the mock-infected group. we examined whether duck IFITMs could inhibit IAV replication in DF-1 cells. the restriction is obvious in the background of DF-1 cells, which express chicken IFITM3 (32) transfection efficiency for each construct was approximately 60%. both epitope-tagged and untagged versions of each dIFITM variant had similar viral restriction capabilities. untagged IFITM3 reduced the percentage of infection of H6N2 and H11N9 in DF-1 cells by 33.6% and 44%, respectively, at an MOI of 1. DF-1 cells overexpressing dIFITM proteins were stained with anti-V5 and anti-LAMP1 antibodies to examine colocalization using confocal microscopy. similar to mammalian IFITM1, dIFITM1 was present at the cell surface. dIFITM2 colocalizes partially with endocytic compartments containing LAMP1. DF1-dIFITM3 cells had 47% fewer H6N2-infected cells. there was no reduction in the percentage of infected cells stably overexpressing dIFITM1, dIFITM2 or dIFITM5. DF1-dIFITM3 cells showed reduced percentages of H6N2-infected cells compared to levels in vector-only cells. duck IFITM3 restricts low-pathogenicity IAV but not VSV. DF1 cells stably expressing all dIFITMs were challenged with H6N2 (A) or VSV (B) at an MOI of 1. The percentage of infected cells was determined using fluorescence microscopy (A) or flow cytometry (B and C) swapping experiments a chimera of human IFITM3 containing the N-terminal domain of IFITM1 loses association with endosomal compartments and loses its ability to restrict the IAV. the dIFITM1 chimera containing the N-terminal domain of dIFITM3 (M3M1) gained significant antiviral function and reduced the percentage of H6N2-infected cells by 61%. chimeric proteins of dIFITM1 and dIFITM3 were expressed at high levels. each protein showed a partial loss of colocalization with LAMP1-containing endosomes. this is in contrast to a human M1M3 chimera, which dramatically loses association with endosomes. stably overexpressing dIFITIM1, dIFITM3, or the chimeric proteins were challenged with H6N2 (B) or VSV (C) at an MOI of 1, the percentage of infected cells was determined relative to empty vector-transfected cells using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. expression of each dIFITM or mutant protein was determined using Western blotting. dIFITM3-Y14F does not colocalize as strongly as wild-type dIFITM3. all mutants colocalized strongly with LAMP1-containing endosomes. dIFITM3-Y14F does not colocalize as strongly as wild-type dIFITM3. cells were stained for nuclei (blue), LAMP1 (green), or dIFITM3 protein or mutant protein (red) a merged image is shown. images are representative of multiple cells analyzed. dIFITM3-Y94F is known to be important for antiviral function. duck IFITM1 is expressed predominantly at the cell surface in both HeLa and HEK293T cells. duck IFITM3-Y14F exists in intracellular punctate structures, likely endosomes. overexpression of human IFITM3 missing first N-terminal 21 amino acids (12) or IFITM3-Y20A (13) results in the accumulation of mutant proteins at the cell surface. dIFITM, dIFITM2, dIFITM3, and dIFITM5 are all composed of two exons and contain a CD225 domain, which is characteristic of IFITM genes. duck IFITM1 has a unique insertion in exon 1 not seen in chicken IFITM1. duck IFITM1 has a unique insertion in exon 1 not seen in chicken IFITM1. several residues shown to be important for antiviral function of human IFITM3 are conserved in ducks. significant divergence between avian and human IFITM1 and IFITM2 suggests they are not direct orthologues. avian and human IFITM3 and IFITM5 share critical residues and greater conservation. a maximum-likelihood tree was generated using 100 bootstrap values to show similarity of orthologous IFITMs. transcripts of IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 were increased in duck lung tissue after infection with two different H5N1 strains. dIFITM3 was only modestly upregulated 4-fold at 3 dpi with VN1203. we observed 2-fold upregulation of dIFITM1 and no upregulation of dIFITM3 and dIFITM5 in intestinal tissue at 1 dpi with BC500. expression of dIFITM1 was upregulated in the lung, the site of infection with highly pathogenic VN1203. we challenged DF-1 cells overexpressing dIFITMs with either H6N2 or H11N9 at an MOI of 1 or 5. the overexpression of dIFITM3 reduced the percentage of H6N2-infected cells by 44% at an MOI of 1 and by 38.6% at an MOI of 5. dIFITM1 and dIFITM3 resulted in a restriction of both H6N2 and H11N9. DF-1 cells transiently overexpressing duck IFITMs or empty vector were challenged with H6N2 (A) or H11N9 (B) at an MOI of 1 or 5. the percentage of infected cells is expressed relative to the vector control. duck IFITMs localize to different cellular compartments. DF1 cells overexpressing dIFITM1, dIFITM2, dIFITM3, or dIFITM5 were fixed, stained, and imaged using confocal microscopy. duck IFITM inhibits influenza virus but does not inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus. DF1-dIFITM3 cells showed reduced percentages of H6N2-, H11N9-, and PR8-infected cells compared to levels in vector-only cells. all stable clones expressed IFITM proteins, although the expression of IFITM2 was low. duck IFITM3 restricts low-pathogenicity IAV but not VSV. the maximum percentage of infected cells for H6N2, H11N9, PR8, and rVSV-GFP was 57%, 15%, 12%, and 55% respectively. supernatants of DF1 cells stably expressing empty vector or dIFITM3 were collected 12 h postinfection with H6N2. dIFITMs or the chimeric proteins were challenged with H6N2 or VSV at an MOI of 1. DF-1 cells stably expressing the dIFITM3 chimera containing the N-terminal domain of dIFITM1 (M1M3) retained an ability to restrict IAV. this restriction is comparable to the reduction observed in DF1-dIFITM3 cells. dIFITM3 and dIFITM5 had significant colocalization with LAMP1. exchanging the N-terminal domain of dIFITM1 with that of dIFITM3 increased the association with LAMP1-containing compartments. this association was not as strong as that for wild-type dIFITM3. dIFITM3-Y14F does not colocalize as strongly as wild-type dIFITM3. dIFITM3-Y14F does not colocalize as strongly as wild-type dIFITM3. dIFITM3-Y14F does not colocalize as strongly as wild-type dIFITM3. colocalization of dIFITM3 or mutant proteins with LAMP1 shows only that the Y14F mutant has a slight decrease in colocalization compared to that of wild-type dIFITM3. of the four point mutants generated from dIFITM3, only Y56F showed a decreased capacity to restrict IAV. however, given its endosomal location, we cannot exclude that reduced function is due to lower expression levels than those of the others. dIFITM protein expression of each stably expressed DF-1 cell line was determined by Western blotting. endogenous chicken IFITM influenced the relative localization of duck IFITMs. duck IFITM1 is expressed predominantly at the cell surface in both HeLa and HEK293T cells. the lack of accumulation of dIFITM3-Y14F at the cell surface suggests dIFITM3 has critical residues outside the N-terminal domain that are required for correct cellular localization and antiviral function. dIFITM3 localizes to endosomes and has antiviral function against influenza viruses, including mammalian strains. dIFITM3 is sufficient to partially localize IFITM1 to the endosomal compartment. it then gains antiviral activity against influenza, suggesting the N-terminal domain of dIFITM3 is only partially responsible for endosomal localization. we used gene synteny and the recently characterized chicken IFITM locus in our annotation of the duck IFITM locus. the restriction of influenza viruses by duck IFITM3 is intact despite low amino acid sequence identity. duck IFITM3 shares only 38% sequence identity with human IFITM3. the restriction of influenza viruses by duck IFITM3 is intact. dIFITM1 has the highest upregulation after highly pathogenic IAV infection. the protein possesses antiviral activity if partially localized to the endosome by the N-terminal domain of dIFITM3. this is where low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus replicates (39) chicken IFITM1 reduced the infection of murine leukemia virus-GFP pseudotyped with H5 entry proteins by about 70% (6). overexpression of chIFITM3 in DF-1 cells reduced WSN infection by 55% compared to that for untransfected controls. duck IFITM3 equally restricts all IAV strains tested, including avian strains, suggests the virus has not evolved to escape restriction. the sites of fusion of viral and host membranes for IAV and VSV correspond to late endosomes/lysosomes and early endosomes. dIFITM3 may have a more restricted cellular localization than its mammalian ortholog; therefore, it may be unable to restrict viruses that enter early endocytic compartments. a single report of antiviral function in the rs12252-C allele suggests that neither deletion of the N-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 nor mutation of Y20 resulted in a loss of antiviral function (51). the authors of that report suggested that epitope tags influence cellular localization or antiviral function of IFITM3 (51); however, we observed no effect of the addition of an N-terminal V5 tag on the antiviral activity of duck this chimera also shows increased antiviral function, suggesting the N-terminal domain is involved in the regulation of cellular localization of duck IFITMs. we also investigated the potential contribution of other putative YXX motifs that are present in duck IFITM3 but not conserved in the human or mouse orthologs. 71 and C72 are conserved in duck IFITM3. this tyrosine is also part of a PPxY recognition site used by the NEDD4 (55), which influences degradation by attaching ubiquitin at four sites (K24, K83, K88, and K104)"}
