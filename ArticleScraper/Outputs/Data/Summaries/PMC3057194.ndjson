{"summary": "Tylosema esculentum bean and tuber extracts have been used in traditional africa medicine to treat diarrhoea. only little chemical characterization has been done to date on the plant. some strains of bovine and human RV have high sequence homology and interspecific infectivity. the bovine strain of rotavirus was used to infect human, pig, chicken, and goat intestine epithelial cells. it is known that infection of intestinal epithelial cells with RV causes disruption of tight junctions and loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) a promising alternative strategy to reducing the burden of diarrhoea caused by RV may lie in identifying and developing cost-effective nutritional or phytomedical solutions. the proposed mechanisms of antiviral effects of T. esculentum are summarised in Figure 1. esculentum plant is kept in the Namibian National Herbarium. water extraction Shade-dried bean and tuber materials (20 g each) were ground to fine powder. volume was adjusted to 200 mL by addition of distilled water. mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm (2050 g) for 30 minutes. cotyledon ethanolic extract (mg) per g of T. esculentum bean cotyledon water extract. cotyledon ethanolic extract (mg) and seed coat ethanolic extract (mCE) extracts were labelled MSCE and MCE. cell lines were routinely grown in 25 cm2 culture flasks (Corning, New York, USA) at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until confluent monolayers attained. DMEM, containing 0.5% FBS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and 1 g of trypsin per mL, was added to each flask. supernatants of RV titrating 1 107.5 TCID50/mL (tissue culture infectious dose 50%, TCID50) were subsequently used for antiviral tests with T. esculentum extracts. similar TCID50 values were obtained by Bae et al. [31] (1.27 106 per mL) when they titrated RV on Macacus Rhesus monkey kidney cells. the extracts were added diluted 10-fold to monolayers of cells in 96 well plates, then maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 24 h. cells were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove T. esculentum extracts and other debris. photometric quantification of crystal violet previously retained in living cells was done at 595 nm with a microplate reader. seed coat ethanolic extract (MSCE) and cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) were dissolved using a rotary magnetic stirrer (Yellowline, BigSquid, Kika-Werke GMBH & Co, Germany) in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Grand Island, USA), supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium), L-glutamine (2 mmol studies on effects of coincubation of rotavirus with T. esculentum extracts on monolayer polarity (TER) of human small intestinal epithelial cells (H4) over Time Human small intestinal epithelial cells (H4) were introduced into inserts in 12-well plates (Corning Transwell, Bedford, USA) at concentration of 1 106 cells/mL. added at 0.75 mg/mL modified from Agelis et al. TER values of monolayers exposed to combinations of marama/Combivir treatments, DMEM, and RV controls were plotted. dilutions of incubated virus were added to 96-well plates and then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium), L-glutamine (2 mmol Tylosema esculentum extracts were introduced at and below IC50 or at 1 and 0.1 mg/mL of MCE. results were expressed as percent difference between nitric oxide release of test from control. the T. esculentum tuber sample was obtained in botswana in 2007. seed coat water extract (MSCW), cotyledon water extract (MCW) and tuber water extract (MTW) were evaporated with a Soxhlet apparatus. extracts from T. esculentum beans and tuber were obtained. cotyledon ethanolic extract (mg/g) and seed coat ethanolic extract (MSCE) extracted. cell lines were grown in 25 cm2 culture flasks (Corning, New York, USA) at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere. cells were washed twice in single strength phosphate buffer (1 PBS) to remove foetal bovine serum (FBS) before infection with RV. flasks with cells were incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37\u00b0C. cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed by microscopy. flasks with cells and virus were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L, Sigma), penicillin (100 units/mL, Sigma), and streptomycin (1 mg/mL, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) extracts were added diluted 10-fold to monolayers of cells in 96 well plates, then maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L, Sigma), penicillin (100 units/mL, Sigma) and streptomycin (1 mg/mL, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) dilutions of combivir GlaxoSmithKline\u2014150 mg lamivudine and 300 mg zidovudine (AZT) as antiviral agent the plant extract and virus, Combivir, and virus mixtures were added to monolayers of cells in 96-well plates and then maintained at 37\u00b0C in atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h. it was previously shown that T. esculentum extracts alone were not cytotoxic at the concentration used in these tests. T. esculentum extracts diluted in DMEM, DMEM alone, and Combivir diluted in DMEM were introduced as respective controls. the effect of the extracts on the cell polarity was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) as control, viral only, T. esculentum only and cell culture medium only treatments were plated onto epithelial cells. percent (%) inhibition of RV by T. esculentum extracts as shown by survival of epithelial cells was calculated. correlation coefficients for data obtained on level of protection, nitric oxide release, and transepithelial resistance were calculated using Statsoft Statistica version 7 software. water Extraction Shade-dried bean and tuber materials (20 g each) were ground to fine powder, the volume was adjusted to 200 mL by addition of distilled water, and left for 16 hours at room temperature. crude bean ethanolic extracts were prepared as described by Bolling and Parkin. ethanolic extraction procedure ensured exclusion of ethanol from the extracts. extracts were labelled MSCE (seed coat ethanolic extract) and MCE (cotyledon ethanolic extract) cell lines were routinely grown in 25 cm2 culture flasks (Corning, New York, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. DMEM, containing 0.5% FBS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and 1 g of trypsin per mL, was added to each flask. tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was determined using the method of Reed and Muench [29]. clarified supernatants of RV titrating 1 107.5 TCID50/mL (tissue culture infectious dose 50%, TCID50) were then used for antiviral tests with T. esculentum extracts. the extracts were added diluted 10-fold to monolayers of cells in 96 well plates, then maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere. cells were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove T. esculentum extracts and other debris. photometric quantification of crystal violet previously retained in living cells was done at 595 nm with a microplate reader. seed coat ethanolic extract (MSCE) and cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) were dissolved using a rotary magnetic stirrer (Yellowline, BigSquid, Kika-Werke GMBH & Co, Germany) in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Grand Island, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium), L-glutamine (2 mmol vir added at 0.75 mg/mL modified from Agelis et al. were measured after 24-hour coincubation of cell monolayers (1 106 cells/mL) at 37\u00b0C in atmosphere of 5% CO2. it was previously shown that T. esculentum extracts alone were not cytotoxic at the concentrations used in these tests. TER values of monolayers exposed to combinations of marama/Combivir treatments, DMEM, and RV controls were plotted. dilutions of the incubated virus were added to 96-well plates and then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Rotavirus showed dose-dependent cytopathic effect on human small intestine epithelial cells (H4 cells), pig small intestine epithelial cells (CLAB) and bovine calf small intestine epithelial cells (CIEB) T. esculentum extracts show direct inhibition of rotavirus infectivity on bovine intestinal epithelial cells (CIEB), pig intestinal epithelial cells (CLAB) and human intestinal epithelial cells (H4). shown above are bars of % survival of epithelial cells. m % standard deviation, respective levels of significance in terms of T values (*) tests were done in triplicate wells. *T value between 0 and 5 (low level significance), **T value greater than 5 (middle level significance), and ***T value greater than 10 (high level significance) exposure to MCE was shown to enhance survival of CIEB cells (56%) and H4 cells (275%) more than that to Combivir. on H4, there was higher protection of cells with all extracts (91%\u2013275%) depending on concentration than Combivir alone. exposure of cells to T. esculentum extracts results in Variable Expression of NO from human intestinal epithelial cells (H4) and Pig Intestinal Epithelial Cells (CLAB) NO2 release was significant from human intestinal epithelial cells (H4) exposed to all extracts used seed coat water and ethanolic extracts (MSCW and MSCE, resp.) only MCE and MTW significantly increased NO in CLAB cells. T. esculentum bean cotyledon ethanolic extract (1 mg/mL), MTW: T. esculentum tuber water extract (0.1 mg/mL), and MCW: T. esculentum bean husk water extract (0.1 mg/mL) pre-exposure to T. esculentum extracts can significantly reduce infectivity of RV. this finding broadly points to inhibition of RV cytopathic effect by T. esculentum extracts prior there was species-specific improvement in cell survival by the extracts. there was high positive correlation between CLAB and H4 cells (r = 0.94), moderately positive correlation between CLAB and CIEB cells (r = 0.57) in survival from rotavirus cytopathic effects after coincubation with T. esculentum extracts. esculentum extracts 0.94 (b) Survival of CIEB cells compared to CIEB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation with T. esculentum extracts 0.57 (d) Survival of CIEB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation compared to preincubation with T. esculentum extracts 0.03 (d) Survival of CIEB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation compared to preincubation with T. esc the method of Reed and Muench [29] was adopted with modifications. rotavirus showed dose-dependent cytopathic effect on human small intestine epithelial cells (H4 cells), pig intestinal epithelial cells (CLAB) and human intestinal epithelial cells (H4). T. esculentum extracts show direct inhibition of rotavirus infectivity on bovine intestinal epithelial cells (CIEB), pig intestinal epithelial cells (CLAB) and human intestinal epithelial cells (H4). shown above are bars of % survival of epithelial cells. of % survival of epithelial cells % change in cell viability after pre-exposure of rotavirus to T. esculentum extracts compared to rotavirus only wells at OD 595 nm % standard deviation. tests were done in triplicate wells. esculentum cotyledon water extract led to highly significant protection of cells against RV. exposure to MCE was shown to enhance survival of CIEB cells (56%) and H4 cells (275%) more than that to Combivir. on H4, there was higher protection of cells with all extracts (91%\u2013275%). shown graphs of change in epithelial cell monolayer polarity exposed to extracts or AZT and rotavirus (treatment wells), extracts or AZT alone (control), or rotavirus alone (negative control) over time compared to respective controls. extracts on release of nitric oxide (% release compared to control) in human small intestine epithelial cells (H4) and pig small intestine epithelial cells (CLAB) pre-exposure to T. esculentum extracts can significantly reduce infectivity of RV. there was species-specific improvement in cell survival by the extracts. there was high positive correlation between CLAB and H4 cells (r = 0.94), moderately positive correlation between CLAB and CIEB cells (r = 0.57) in survival from rotavirus cytopathic effects after coincubation. treatment correlation coefficient (r) (a) Survival of H4 cells compared to CLAB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation with T. esculentum extracts 0.94 (b) Survival of CIEB cells compared to CIEB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation with T. esculentum extracts 0.02 (d) Survival of CIEB cells from rotavirus effects with coincubation compared to preincubation with T. esculentum T. esculentum bean cotyledons had low or no cytotoxicity, as shown by high IC50 concentrations. seed coat and tuber extracts, especially seed coat ethanolic extract (MSCE) and tuber water extract (MTW), had elevated cytotoxic effects. diluted cytotoxicity at lower extract concentrations was cell culture dependent. positive correlation between levels of protection of intestinal cells from cytopathic effects of RV (crystal violet assay) with coincubation and preincubation and enhancement of polarity (TER) of H4, CLAB, and CIEB cells. some phenolic acids, which were expected to dominate the ethanolic extracts, have inactivation effect against RV. the inhibitive effects of T. esculentum extracts could also be due to enhanced release of nitric oxide (NO) from intestinal cells. the observed antirotaviral effects can be attributed to the high phenolic acid content (especially gallic acid), in bean cotyledons, among other components. ethanolic extracts had notably higher antiviral activity than aqueous bean and tuber extracts. the antiviral activity of phytosterols is through the blocking effect on immediate-early antigen expression in fibroblast cells and blocking of virus-cell interaction and/or virus multiplication. our results have shown high in vitro inhibition of RV by T. esculentum extracts, especially seed coat ethanolic extracts."}
