{"summary": "the amount of data being produced in the sciences continues to expand at a tremendous rate[1], and also at an increasing rate, is the demand to make this data openly available to other researchers, both pre-publication[2] and post-publication[3]. considerable effort and attention has been given to improving the portability of data by developing data format standards[4], minimal information for experiment reporting[5]\u2013[8], data sharing polices[9], and data management[10]\u2013[13]. bio-mirror (http://www.bio-mirror.net/) was started in 1999 and consists of several servers sharing the same identical datasets in various countries. it is restricted to only very popular genomic datasets and does not include the fast growing datasets such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) the BitTorrent protocol works by splitting the data into small pieces. the large dataset can be distributed in pieces and downloaded from various sources. a checksum is created for each file piece to verify the integrity of the data. bioTorrents is a legal BitTorrent tracker that hosts scientific data and software. a secondary tracker is added automatically to all new torrents uploaded to BioTorrents. bioTorrents has several features supporting the finding, sharing, and commenting of torrents. torrents are indexed by google (http://www.google.com) allowing users searching for datasets to be directed to their availability on BioTorrents. the user downloads and opens the torrent file in the user's previously installed BitTorrent client software. the integrity of each data piece is verified using the original file hash provided in the downloaded torrent. the user creates a torrent file on their personal computer using the same BitTorrent client software that is used for downloading. the only piece of information the user needs to create the torrent is the bioTorrents tracker announce URL which is personalized for each user. only users that have created a free account with BioTorrents can upload new torrents. bioTorrents allows torrents to be optionally grouped into versions. users can be notified via a Really Simple Syndication feed that a new version is available on BioTorrents. a user could copy the RSS feed for a dataset that is being updated often on BioTorrents. bioTorrents RSS feeds can be configured for certain categories, license types, users, and search terms. the RSS feeds can be used with many BitTorrent clients to automatically download all or some of the datasets on BioTorrents without human intervention. a secondary tracker is added to all new torrents uploaded to BioTorrents. the user downloads and opens the torrent file in the user's previously installed BitTorrent client software (Table 1). the user can then control many aspects of their download (stopping, starting, download limits, etc.) the BitTorrent client will automatically connect with other clients sharing the same torrent and begin to download pieces in a non-random order. the user creates a torrent file on their personal computer using the same BitTorrent client software that is used for downloading (Table 1). the only piece of information the user needs to create the torrent is the bioTorrents tracker announce URL which is personalized for each user. only users that have created a free account with BioTorrents are able to upload new torrents. the RSS feed can be used to obtain automated updates for datasets that are often changing, such as genomic and protein databases. a user could copy the RSS feed for a dataset that is being updated often on BioTorrents into their BitTorrent RSS capable client. the speed and effectiveness of the BitTorrent protocol depends on the number of peers. large institutions and data repositories could offer their popular or larger datasets via BioTorrents as an alternative method for download with minimal effort. large institutions and data repositories such as GenBank[18] could offer their popular or larger datasets as an alternative method for download with minimal effort. bioTorrents.net was derived from the TBDev.net (http://tbdev.net) GNU General Public Licensed (GPL) project. the dynamic web pages are coded in PHP with some features being implemented with JavaScript. all information, including information about users, torrents, and discussion forums are stored in a MySQL database."}
