{"summary": "chyloabdomen is a rare condition in human and veterinary medicine. it results from leakage of lipid-rich lymph into the peritoneal cavity. it is secondarily to obstruction or increased permeability of lymphatic vessels. a feline coronavirus research by polymerase chain reaction on effusion was negative. echocardiography was unremarkable. no mass was identified and the pancreas showed no significant ultrasonographic abnormalities. images were obtained with a multi-detector helical CT scan at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes after injection. only two lymph nodes in the sacral region and one hypogastric were marked with iodixanol. the remaining lymphatic system was not correctly visualized. no other abnormalities were seen on thorough examination of abdominal cavity. cat was discharged 2 days after surgery with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 20 mg/kg BW, PO, q12h for 5 days. three days after discharge, the cat was presented to the referring veterinarian for inappetence and depression. despite administration of prednisolone, the cat\u2019s condition worsened with rapid recurrence of effusion. cases in dogs were reported in association with intestinal lymphangiectasia. chylous ascites in cats have been reported in association with neoplastic disease. chylous ascites in cats have been reported in association with neoplastic disease. in this case report, pancreatic carcinoma was identified as the underlying cause of the chyloabdomen. in human medicine, direct malignant cells invasion into lymphatic vessels and obstruction of lymphatic flow by lymph node metastatic infiltration are thought to explain chyloabdomen formation. failure of lymphangiography in this case may be explained by species differences in absorption of subcutaneously injected contrast media, inappropriate dose of iodixanol or differences in the underlying disease responsible for chylous effusion. chyloabdomen is an uncommon tumor in cats with a high metastatic rate and a poor prognosis. rutin is a benzopyrone flavonoid extracted from plants. it may reduce leakage from blood vessels, increase proteolysis and removal of protein from tissues, and enhance macrophage phagocytosis of chyle. chylous ascites is an uncommon condition in dogs. plastic disease is a leading cause of chylous abdominal effusion in cats. the identification of the underlying cause relies on a systematic and often fastidious approach."}
