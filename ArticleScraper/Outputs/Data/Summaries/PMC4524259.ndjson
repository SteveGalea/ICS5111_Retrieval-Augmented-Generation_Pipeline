{"summary": "TEXT Virus eradication is the holy grail of viral epidemiology. if the entire population becomes immune to a given pathogen, the pathogen's basic reproductive ratio (R0) will drop below 1, leaving the infection to die out in the long run. the enthusiasm generated by this great achievement in preventive medicine was tempered during the following decades. capusinszky et al. used the bottleneck that led to the establishment of the Chlorocebus sabaeus monkey population in the Caribbean islands. the bottleneck resulted in the extinction of several pathogens present in the african populations of sabaeus monkeys but absent in the Caribbean monkeys. the study by Kapusinszky et al. provides a compelling proof of concept that human pathogens can be eradicated through host population bottlenecks. the study provides a compelling proof of concept that human pathogens can be eradicated through host population bottlenecks. the study provides a compelling proof that human pathogens can be eradicated through host population bottlenecks. the first colonist crews will depart for the mission one-way in 2026. they should be tested and selected based on lack of deadly pathogens. at the end of the day, this is a unique opportunity to create and live in a world without viruses."}
