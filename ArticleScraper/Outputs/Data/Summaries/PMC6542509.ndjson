{"summary": "the world tourism organization forecasts international tourist arrivals to grow 3.3% annually between 2010 and 2030. such arrivals at emerging and developing countries (up 4.4% annually) will double those at advanced economies (up 2.2% annually) emerging economies are expected to reach 57% by 2030. the annual number of international travelers that required attention at the IVCs grew, reaching 300,000 in 2017[6] despite this high number of travelers, few population-based data exist. a study of global tourism found lower numbers of international trips coincided with two events that had widespread global impact. the IVCMa, in southern Spain, covers a population of approximately one million residents. in the past 3 years, 9,000\u201310,000 travelers a year have visited it, accounting for approximately 3%\u20135% of people accessing the 107 IVCs nationwide. travelers requesting medical care receive mandatory and/or recommended vaccines. study considered a destination health risk assignment when one of the countries visited was classified by WHO as having high or medium risk of hepatitis A virus infection[7]. travelers typically go to IVCs on the recommendation of travel agencies, advertisements or media campaigns related to the preparation for trips to health risk countries, or on the recommendation of friends, travel websites or other information sources. the number of travelers visiting the IVCMa increased almost continuously over the study period, although some stages of deceleration or negative growth were seen. unforeseen impacts from internationally impactful events, such as terrorist attacks, political instability, health pandemics, natural disasters, were considered. 94,683 TAs requested health information on at least 113,529 countries between 2000 and 2017. the WHO Americas Region was the most common destination (29.9%) followed by the WHO African Region (24.2%), WHO South-East Asia Region (23.6%), and WHO Western Pacific Region (14.5%). in 2017 the total demand for information for these two regions was 47.3% (28.8% in 2005) but in the WHO African Region, demand in relation to total annual demand declined from 36.8% (2005) to 20.4% (2017). the months of June and July had the highest number of traveler consultations. Table 2 shows a timeline of some of the most well-known events that could affect international travel between 2000 and 2017. the demand for pre-travel consultation at the IVCMa increased 347% from 2,885 travelers (2000) to around 10,000 in 2017. between 2000 and 2017, the number of trips abroad increased 420% across all of Spain\u2019s population. between 2015 and 2017 the average increase in TAs at the IVCMa was 10%. this increase was higher than the 3.9% recorded worldwide in the number of international tourist arrivals in the same period[1] despite this, the average number of prescribed vaccines per traveler gradually increased from 1.8 to 3.0 over the course of the study. between 2000 and 2011, 33.3% (SD 0.93) of trips by EU residents were taken in the third quarter of the year[11,13] in some years a reduction in trip seasonality is observed. in 2016, an increase of 4% in the number of Spanish residents traveling internationally was observed, and 35% (5,503,892) travelled between July and September, which was down 3.4% from the same period in 2015[8]. tourism is generally affected by local problems of varying etiology. tourism demand is highly sensitive to terrorist attacks and political violence. terrorist attacks on new york city and Washington, D.C. led to a decrease in tourism worldwide. conflict in north africa since mid-2015 has shifted demand to countries in southern Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. demand for pre-travel health information related to Southeast Asian destinations grew tenfold, from a total of 712 queries in 2005 (28.8%) to 7,165 in 2017 (47.3%) in 2017, Thailand was the country for which the largest number of requests health information were received. inbound tourist arrivals increased from 31.1 million in 2010 to 51.9 million in 2015. this growth for Asian destinations reflects travelers\u2019 perceptions of safety and the possibility of making cheaper, non-organized trips. this growth is expected to continue in the coming years[15,34\u201336] study on the demand for pre-travel health information at the IVCMa provides valuable surveillance data on international travelers residing in southern Spain. a sharp increase in the number of travelers, and consequently in the demand for pre-travel health advice, can be expected in accordance with forecasts of international organizations concerned with travel and tourism. based on the results of this research, it is uncertain to predict the impact of crises or other events on the number of travelers requesting pre-travel medical information. additional studies on the evolution of the demand for pre-travel care, and incorporation of new additional questions, should allow us to identify and quantify new travel-related problems and help improve policies and programs for providing care for travelers."}
