{"summary": "despite this, proteomics has been limited in these disciplines due to a number of reasons, including cost, lack of good genomic data from many species of interest and a lack of awareness of the potential of this technology by animal scientists. here we provide examples of successful applications of proteomics in animal production and health. proteomic investigations have been undertaken to assess alteration in fish muscle (Kjaersgard et al., 2006) and in meat maturation, particularly in relation to product safety and verification of the species of origin (Paredi et al., 2012). proteomic investigations have been undertaken to assess alteration in fish muscle (Kjaersgard et al., 2006) and in meat maturation. trophoretic protein labelling with fluorescent dyes (fluorophores) allow direct detection of separated protein spots. proteins of interest are enzymatically digested into peptides. peptides of interest are usually those that vary in intensity in a treatment- or disease-dependent comparison. proteomics in farm animals during production in health and disease Proteomics in ruminants: health and disease Proteomics encompasses new and emerging technologies that will facilitate sustainable animal production, quality and welfare. most proteomic investigations of bovine mastitis using strategies including 2DE followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)/MS and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have been performed on bovine milk because of the relative ease of sample collection. the serum proteome profile in cows with naturally occurring subclinical and clinical mastitis was investigated with three different yet complementary approaches. results demonstrated differential protein expression in the serum of cows with both subclinical and clinical mastitis. new proteomic studies have identified the three highly immunogenic proteins in bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates involved in virulence. 15 proteins exhibited variable expression in a range of S. aureus isolates. the proteome of pathogenic leptospires is modulated to facilitate host evasion by diminution of antigen expression. a significant amount of proteomic studies have been performed on porcine species. the porcine species is an important animal model for the study of disease in humans. proteomics has been already used to study the pathogenesis of herpes viruses. proteomics application in aquaculture is mainly focused on nutrition, welfare and health management. these have proven to be major constraints to an efficient production in aquaculture systems. a recent trend to move away from the traditional use of marine-harvested resources towards a diet-containing vegetable protein and oil sources. proteomics has been assisting with this problem, especially at the level of development of new vaccines and disease diagnostics. recent studies describe the isolation and proteome analysis of the envelope proteins of the pathogen Iridovirus. proteomics focused on the \u2018parasite\u2019, trying to identify the expression pattern of parasites, which is particularly challenging because of their different development stages. a second research direction followed the \u2018host\u2019 aspect, thus focussing on the complex dynamics that underlie the interaction between host immune system and parasite. metaproteomics could offer a phenotypic profile on samples preserving the meta-species environment. alteration in the microbial ecosystem (saliva, digestive tract, mammalian glands) in farm animals would provide functional information for diagnosis but also aid in evaluating stress responses. stress in dairy cows is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases such as mastitis, Johne\u2019s disease, salmonellosis and bovine respiratory complex. stress in dairy cows is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases such as mastitis, Johne\u2019s disease, salmonellosis and bovine respiratory complex. apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), cathelicidin-I, heat shock 70kD protein and the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) were identified in milk fractions from cows with naturally occurring mastitis. a total of 300 milk proteins were identified with links to host response to infection in the mammary gland. pathogen proteomics Proteomic technologies have been used to provide novel approaches and insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of bacterial infection in farm animals diseases. a limited number of proteomic studies have focused on pathogen responses during clinical intramammary infections. proteomic technologies are compatible with novel extraction procedures to enrich for bacterial hydrophobic outer membrane proteins expressed during infection. proteomic technologies are compatible with novel extraction procedures to enrich for bacterial hydrophobic outer membrane proteins expressed during infection. proteomic studies have been performed on porcine species. aquaculture companies are now breeding fish to improve traits such as their growth rate, conversion of feed into muscle, disease resistance, fertility and other features associated with food quality. one of the main challenges faced by this industry is its impact on environmental sustainability where clearly a public intolerance to potential new source of pollution may act as a drawback. fish diseases are responsible for the main economic losses in aquaculture. these diseases are caused by viral, parasitic and bacterial infections. vaccination is the main research area for disease prevention. studies focussed on the analysis of plasma proteins have concentrated on the detection and validation of welfare markers. proteins like microglobulins, macroglobulins, apolipoproteins, 1-antitrypsin, transferrin, plasminogen and complement system proteins among others being identified as possible candidates. the field of parasitology has been quick to exploit emerging proteomics technologies. metaproteomics could provide identification and relative quantification of protein and protein families recovered directly from environmental samples or from a concrete ecosystem. this methodological approach aims to move from a functional understanding of a single species proteome elucidating the proteomic complexity from a larger community. protein composition of egg cuticle represents a milestone and highlights several parameters that can be used to assess egg quality. this is particularly important as partial damage to the cuticle exposes eggs to microbial contamination from food-borne pathogens. milk Several recent reviews have presented the application of proteomics in milk science, from description of a bovine PeptideAtlas to milk production. some reports have also focused their attention on the diagnostic value of milk proteomes in mastitis. the authors showed that milk from these cows has an increased quantity of acute-phase proteins, galactose\u20131\u2013phosphate and unsaturated fatty acid. these observations have provided some insight into the potential mechanisms involving stomatin and galactose-1-phosphate in NEB dairy cow\u2019s milk. proteomics in poultry has focused on two fields of research, meat quality and the study of infectious diseases. proteomics in poultry has focused on basically two fields of research, meat quality and the study of infectious diseases. proteomics has become increasingly used as a tool to describe, understand and improve protein-based foods during the last decade. this explains why proteomics has become increasingly used as a tool to describe, understand and improve protein-based foods during the last decade. the casertana breeds grow slower and have more backfat and intramuscular fat than fast growing and leaner breeds like the Large White. the slower postmortem pH decline in meat from Casertana pigs and differences in metabolic rate were supported by differences in protein abundance and levels of specific metabolites. many metabolic enzymes, cellular defence and stress proteins change in abundance postmortem. the proteome analyses support a shift in energy metabolism postmortem. the abundance of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and 70 is decreased. teomics of processed meat Production of cooked ham involves several processing steps. an initial salting step is also a central part of the processing when producing dry-cured hams. most of these proteins belong to the myofibrillar protein fraction. the literature is mainly focused on \u2018egg\u2019 as a reproductive stage. the literature is focused on \u2018egg\u2019 as a reproductive stage and not for its nutritional features. authors concluded that the proteome of different egg varieties has the same components; however, the relative abundance of individual proteins does vary between the different egg varieties. some reports have focused their attention on the diagnostic value of milk proteomes in mastitis. a proteomic and metabolomic approach was applied to study NEB in milk. these authors showed that milk from these cows has an increased quantity of acute-phase proteins, galactose\u20131\u2013phosphate and unsaturated fatty acid, in comparison with milk from cattle with a good energy balance. wedholm et al. (2008) described protein markers of cheese yield through proteomic analysis. highlighted several proteins related to the production as a specific -CN fragment, an isoform B of lactoglobulin, and other whey proteins as lactoferrin and vitamin D-binding proteins. proteomics has become increasingly used as a tool to describe, understand and improve protein-based foods during the last decade. proteomics has become increasingly used as a tool to describe, understand and improve protein-based foods during the last decade. proteomics has been used as a tool to explain food quality variation. the casertana breeds grow slower and have more backfat and intramuscular fat than fast growing and leaner breeds like the Large White. postmortem changes in the porcine muscle proteome include both metabolic enzymes and myofibrillar proteins. similar studies performed in beef show that many metabolic enzymes, cellular defence and stress proteins change in abundance postmortem. proteomics of processed meat Production of cooked ham involves several processing steps such as injection of brine with different salt content. an initial salting step is also a central part of the processing when producing dry-cured hams. most of these proteins belong to the myofibrillar protein fraction. igues et al. (2012) identified several proteins in rainbow trout muscle that are correlated to the textural attributes. current and future technical advances for animal proteomics The evolution of proteomics this last decade is strongly correlated to both technology and bioinformatics advances. specific methodologies have been or need to be developed. many suitable protocols for a wide variety of species and tissues are available. methods from human proteomic studies are often directly applicable to animal proteomics. enzymatic digestion of proteins into peptides leads to a more homogeneous set of molecules sharing similar properties. gel-free techniques are generally more robust because they are completely automatized and directly applicable to a wide range of studies. the most recent technical advance in the gel-based method is the difference gel electrophoresis or difference in gel electrophoresis. this allows the separation of two to three samples in a same gel and/or the use of an internal standard, thus improving statistical reliability and decreasing the hurdle of reproducibility between gels. label-free methods are generally applied for large studies with a high number of samples to be analysed. at the MS acquisition point of view, two main approaches exist. in one, the data-dependent acquisition implies an isolation in gas phase of each ion to be further fragmented in tandem MS to collect peptide sequence information. selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and the related multiple reaction monitoring are currently favoured methods for biomarker verification and for targeted and absolute quantification approaches. the method is essentially based on tandem MS analyses, where only a few selected peptides (typically 2 to 4 peptides/protein) are measured. pig, cow and horse proteomes are among the best covered species. pig, cow and horse proteomes are among the best covered species. pig, cow and horse proteomes are also relatively well represented in this resource. the bovine PeptideAtlas comprises 1921 proteins and 8559 distinct peptides. the equine PeptideAtlas covers >2600 proteins and 24 000 peptides. the resources currently provide a valuable tool for the selection of proteotypic peptides suitable for quantitative studies. chimeric protein is designed as a concatamer of tryptic standard peptides. 13C-labelled Arg and Lys are used, which adds a mass difference of +6 Da to each peptide mass spiked into biological samples. the method proved successful for efficient and absolute quantification of 17 of the targeted proteins within healthy and inflamed mammary gland tissues. methods from human proteomic studies are often directly applicable to animal proteomics in the majority of circumstances. however, it is not possible here to review all possible protocols variations. we want to highlight the common key steps that need to be applied before proteomic analysis is undertaken. enzymatic digestion of proteins into peptides leads to a more

been used to characterize disease states in production animals and to determine the origin and source of feed products. proteomics has been used to characterize disease states in production animals. proteomics has been used to monitor changes in muscle protein as it matures to meat. it has been adopted to monitor food composition, authenticity and safety. it was established to overcome the principle hurdles to the applications of proteomics in farm animal science. omic analysis of young in comparison to old osteoarthritic equine cartilage. proteomic analysis of a range of pathogens, including zoonotics. examples of funded missions focussing on food production, quality and food safety. overcoming the limited nature of genomes of species such as seabream and Atlantic salmon is one pivotal problem encountered in the interpretation of MS data for animal species. ensuring that the bioinformatic tools are as advanced as possible would be a valuable asset in the development of proteomics for farm animals. a proteomic study of liver samples showed downregulation of enzymes of oxidation in cows with fatty liver. this showed downregulation of enzymes of oxidation in cows with fatty liver, which are significantly more exposed to oxidative stress. proteomics techniques and strategies dealing with complex samples were introduced to clinical pathologists indicating the important problems encountered. new Zealand partner of FA1002 has had a strong tradition in wool fibre proteomics. this is a difficult sample that involves the access to dedicated protein databases and challenged by the correct identification of proteins that are extremely similar. this action made possible one Reciprocal STSM (basically an STSM involving a European researcher who conducted a short stay in one of the reciprocal agreement COST countries: Australia, South Africa, Argentina and, in this particular case, New Zealand) veterinary and animal diagnostics will recognize the need to explore the proteome of blood and tissues from experimental or natural disease investigations. a growing range of applications for proteomics of domestic animals, evidenced over the last few years, will extend the demand for expertise to apply the technology as access and the knowledge base increases. ing on animal health include characterization of circulating in comparison to pulmonary serum amyloid A protein in pigs with respiratory disease. characterization of circulating in comparison to pulmonary serum amyloid A protein in pigs with respiratory disease; proteomic analysis of young in comparison to old osteoarthritic equine cartilage; and proteomic analysis of a range of pathogens. bioinformatics for FAP highlighted two important problems for the discipline. first, the importance of studies on PTM of proteins and second, the need to create specialized spectral libraries that would be the key to designing sensitive MS-based assays. an international meeting of animal clinical pathologists (ISACP and ESVCP, Ljubljana, Slovenia) and General Proteomics (Seprot, Barcelona, Spain) the former groups comprise the laboratory professionals responsible for animal health testing and expressed particular interest in the rapid development of proteomics for biomarker discovery. the huge problem of NEB and fatty liver in cattle is addressed by a proteomic study of liver samples. new Zealand, and particularly AgResearch, has had a strong tradition in wool proteomics. this action made possible one Reciprocal STSM involving a European researcher who conducted a short stay in one of the reciprocal agreement COST countries. this brought together a Portuguese researcher\u2019s interest in seasonal weight loss with AgResearch expertise in wool fibre proteomics. a growing range of applications for proteomics of domestic animals will extend the demand for expertise to apply the technology as access and the knowledge base increases. a common problem in examination of the serum proteome is the overabundance of the proteins with the highest concentration, such as albumin and immunoglobulins. there is a need for the consortium to continue and to expand to include experts from beyond Europe either by formation of an association or by linkage to an established group. the use of proteomics in animal research has gone beyond a few, isolated laboratories."}
