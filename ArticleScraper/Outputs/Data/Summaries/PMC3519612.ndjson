{"summary": "identification of epitopes on the PEDV M protein will be helpful in the elucidation of the antigenic properties of this protein. one hybridoma cell line secreting anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (McAb) was generated and designated 4D4. dehydration, is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine. it is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) it is one of the most important viral causes of diarrhea. the virus was first reported in england in 1971. fusion proteins tM-His6 and GST-tM could react with porcine anti-PEDV serum as shown by WB analysis. tM-His6 and GST-tM could react with porcine anti-PEDV serum as shown by WB analysis. the isotype of the McAb was IgG2b with light chain (data not shown) the 4D4 McAb recognized a 27-kDa band of the PEDV M protein, while showing no reactivity against the TGEV virion. this results demonstrated that the 4D4 McAb recognized specifically the native M protein of PEDV. ELISA showed reactivity with the McAb 4D4. peptides M13 (194GWAFYVR200) and M14 (195WAFYVR200) failed to show reactivity. the results of the ELISA were confirmed further by WB analysis. the epitope peptide 195WAFYVR200, defined by McAb 4D4, could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum from pigs but not TGEV-positive serum. the epitope M14 could differentiate PEDV-positive serum from TGEV-positive serum. the dots represent residues that match the epitope exactly. the homologous regions of different coronaviruses are in the box. abbreviations of each virus and its strain are listed. the isotype of the McAb was IgG2b with light chain. the 4D4 McAb recognized a 27-kDa band of the PEDV M protein. this showed no reactivity against the TGEV virion. ELISA showed reactivity with the McAb 4D4 as primary antibody. peptides M13 (194GWAFYVR200) and M14 (195WAFYVR200) were recognized strongly by the McAb 4D4. the epitope peptide 195WAFYVR200, defined by McAb 4D4, could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum from pigs but not TGEV-positive serum. the epitope M14 could differentiate PEDV-positive serum from TGEV-positive serum. the epitope M14 could differentiate PEDV-positive serum from TGEV-positive serum. Y198 and V199 are relatively conserved among all the coronaviruses selected. the dots represent residues that match the epitope exactly. the homologous regions of different coronaviruses that correspond to the identified epitope are in the box. the fusion protein GST-tM was selected as an immunogen to elicit the formation of antibody. the coating antigen bore a different tag from the immunogen. the epitope was located at M3, which spans from residues 160 to 226 of the amino acid sequence of the tM protein. epitope 195WAFYVR200 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein. it was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and WB analysis. the epitope did not react with TGE-positive serum, but showed reactivity with PEDV-positive serum. this study was 195WAFYVR200, and by comparison the homologous region of the IBV M protein was 199FATFVY204. the linear B-cell epitope identified, 195WAFYVR200, was highly conserved among different PEDV isolates. this epitope could differentiate PEDV-positive serum from TGEV-positive serum. primers used in this study Peptides Primer sequences (5\u20193\u2019) Position Size of amplicon tM-His6 F: ATACATATGAGCATTCGGTTGTGGCG 295\u2013678 384bp F: TAAGGATCGAGGACTAAATGAAGCACTTTCTCTCTCAC 295\u2013480 186bp F: TATCTCGAGGACTACTACTTCTGTGAT M3 R: CTACTCGAGGTAAGTAG gatccTCAGCTGTGAGTAATCCGAGTGCGGTTCTCACAGATtaac 592\u2013627 36bp R: tcgagttaATCTGTGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA at the 5\u2019 and 5\u2019 terminal of each reverse strand there is a sequence \u201cgatcc\u201d and \u201ctaac\u201d (in italics), respectively. when the forward and reverse oligonucleotides annealed they form a cohesive BamHI site or a cohesive XhoI site at the 3\u2019 terminus. lified truncated form of the M gene (tM, 387bp) was cloned into prokaryotic expression vectors pET-30a and pGEX-6p-1. plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and induced by Isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) the hybridoma cells were seeded into 96-well plates and selected in hypoxanthine\u2013aminopterin\u2013thymidine (HAT) medium and hypoxanthine\u2013thymidine (HT) medium in sequence. the positive hybridoma cell clones were subcloned thrice by limiting dilution. a panel of 17 partially overlapping peptides (M1\u2013M17) spanning the tM protein were expressed successively. for each peptide M4\u2013M17, a pair of oligonucleotide strands was synthesized. the resultant double-stranded DNA contained a BamHI and a XhoI cohesive terminus. the color was hed thrice and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the reaction was terminated with 2 M H2SO4. the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. the conservation of the identified epitope among PEDV reference strains, the epitope sequence and flanking sequences of the M protein were compared with those of nine other selected PEDV strains using the DNAMAN software. alignment analysis was also performed between the defined epitope and the corresponding regions of other associated coronavirus strains using the DNAMAN software.
