{"summary": "influenza A viruses can be classified into subtypes H1\u2013H18 and N1\u2013N11. avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8, are most prevalent human subtypes. rapid detection and subtyping are the first steps in the characterization of influenza A viruses. the RVP assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) is a CE-marked kit based on suspension microarray technology that enables the detection of many viruses in a single reaction. the kit and instrument is a major disadvantage of the Luminex RVP assay. the Luminex RVP assay and commercial real-time PCR kits were used to separately detect human and avian influenza viruses for comparison. all experiments involving virus cultures of highly pathogenic viruses were conducted under BSL-3 containment. primers and probes were designed and analyzed using the Oligo 7.0 software. were aligned using BLAST with relative sequences in GenBank to verify the specific amplification. specific forward and reverse primers were used for HA and NA gene amplification.

(2016), 68.8% in a report by Gadsby et al. (2010), and only 14% for H1N1 and 0% for H3N2 in a report by Raymaekers et al. (2011). the sensitivity results were inconsistent because the specimens were collected during different epidemic seasons from different regions worldwide. the sequence variation rate of the influenza A viruses in the primer-probe binding region of the Luminex RVP assay is high, leading to negative results. the detection of the 2011\u20132012 season specimens showed a sensitivity of 100% for FluA. the non-subtyped H3N2 strains using the Luminex RVP assay in this study were further subjected to genetic sequencing, and the occurrence of mutations and reassortment was verified. however, we could not exclude the possibility that a portion of these 15 specimens were positive for both H1N1 and H3N2, and the H1N1 virus could not be detected by both assays. negative specimens detected using multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor were less than 102 copies/mL. the other 23 H7N9-positive specimens with viral copies greater than 102 copies/mL showed positive results using the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor. however, the advantage of the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor is that it can simultaneously detect and subtype influenza A viruses."}
