{"summary": "international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock were published in the early of 2013 (1). the crucial information was still to advocate the achievement of early restoration of tissue perfusion and elimination of likely pathogens through bundlelized strategies including early goal-directed therapy. the conclusion was compromised seriously due to fraud evidences from german researcher whose investigations have been retracted lately. there is no evidence that resuscitation with colloids reduces the risk of death compared to resuscitation with crystalloid fluids. mortality in critically ill patients presenting with hypovolemic shock have been investigated. this multi-center randomized clinical trial enrolled 2,857 patients. the 28-day mortalities were 25.4% and 27.0% for colloids and crystalloids respectively. the combination of vasopressin (20 IU/CPR cycle) and epinephrine (1 mg/CPR circle) plus methylprednisolone (40 mg) (VSE) could result in improved cerebral function classification at discharge, higher probability for return of spontaneous circulation 20 min, improved hemodynamics and ScvO2. french researchers (11) investigated whether fluid management guided by daily BNP plasma concentrations improves weaning outcomes. the results suggested furosemide and acetazolamide were given more often and in higher doses in the BNP-driven group than in the control group. the results suggested a more negative median fluid balance during weaning. bein et al. and bein et al. investigated the effects of a low tidal volume [Vt strategy (Vt 3 mL/kg/predicted body weight (PBW) with extracorporeal CO2 elimination in established ARDS. the mortality rate did not differ between groups. mechanically ventilated patients underwent whole-lung computed tomography (CT) on a fixed thoracic transverse slice at PEEP 5 and 15 cm H2O. results suggest prone positioning further decreased nonaerated tissue and reduced tidal hyperinflation observed at PEEP 15 in supine patients. prone positioning may enhance lung recruitment and decrease alveolar instability and hyperinflation. use of the tracheostomy collar achieved faster weaning (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44-7.70; P=0.005) Mortality was equivalent in pressure-support and tracheostomy groups at 6 and 12 months. 30-day all-cause mortality after randomization was 30.8% in the early and 31.5% in the late group. the score\u2019s AUC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.96), with a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 89%, a negative predictive value of 98%, and a positive predictive value of 36%. this approach could help to discriminate difficult and non-difficult intubation in the ICU. parenteral selenium treatment significantly reduced all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis (RR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.99, P=0.04, I2=0%) no significant differences were observed in infectious complications and hospital length of stay. small bowel feeding was associated with a reduced risk of ICU-acquired pneumonia. duration of ventilation, length of ICU stay and mortality were unaffected by the route of feeding. however, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity in studies included. eritoran is a synthetic lipid A antagonist that blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from binding at the cell surface MD2-TLR4 receptor. no significant difference in the primary end point of 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality between the eritoran group and the placebo group. the overall rate of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections was 4.78 cases per 1,000 patient-days with chlorhexidine bathing versus 6.60 cases per 1,000 patient-days with nonantimicrobial washcloths. the overall rate of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections was 4.78 cases per 1,000 patient-days with chlorhexidine bathing versus 6.60 cases per 1,000 patient-days with nonantimicrobial washcloths (P=0.007) polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were detected in recipients of selective decontamination. it was proposed to include a further study to assess the effects of selective decontamination on the long-term development of resistance rates. probiotics reduced the incidence of CDAD by 66% (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.24-0.49; I2=0%). no inter-group difference was observed in the incidence of C difficile diarrhea (CDD) a targe ICP 20 mmHg was specified for the pressure-monitoring group. the other second outcomes, such as six-month mortality, and median length of stay in the ICU were similar. antipyretic and hypothermia therapies A French Research Group (46) tested hypothesis that induced hypothermia improves outcome in patients with severe bacterial meningitis. hypothermia group received a loading dose of 4 \u00b0C cold saline and were cooled to 32 to 34 \u00b0C for 48 hours. five randomized clinical trials in 399 patients were included. the temperature threshold for treatment in the intervention group was commonly 38.3 to 38.5 \u00b0C, whereas it was typically 40.0 \u00b0C for controls. the effect of simvastatin (60 mg, daily) therapy on prognosis of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was investigated in another multicenter trial (52) performed in 26 ICUs in france. the study was stopped prematurely after enrollment of 300 patients. the probability of survival at six weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% vs. 91%; HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33-0.92; P=0.02) further bleeding rate, adverse events as well as portal-pressure gradient within the first five days were promisingly better than that in the liberal-strategy group. there are few milestone discoveries derived from T1, fecal transplantation and bedside infection control. however, following large clinical trials only achieved negative outcomes. this paradoxical situation has almost become a universal phenomenon for intensivists."}
