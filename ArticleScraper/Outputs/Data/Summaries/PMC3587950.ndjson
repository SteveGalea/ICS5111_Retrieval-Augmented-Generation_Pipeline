{"summary": "the complete genome sequences of several PEDV strains from southern china have been reported. the whole genome of the CH/ZMDZY/11 strain is 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length, excluding the poly(A tail. the typical gene order 5\u2032-ORF1a/1b\u2013S\u2013ORF3\u2013E\u2013M\u2013N -3\u2032 is similar to those of other reported PEDVs. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome contain 292-nt and 334-nt untranslated regions. the whole genome contains seven coding regions. the entire genome contains seven coding regions. there is a continuous 17-amino-acid deletion in the ORF3 gene of attenuated DR13 (82YCPLLYYCGALLDATII98) this deletion does not exist in CH/ZMDZY/11 and other Chinese strains."}
