{"summary": "case-patients were identified from persons hospitalized with an acute respiratory infection considered to have a suspected case of H5N1 infection. clinicians did not use a systematic case definition or screening protocol to identify patients eligible for testing for H5N1 infection. control-respondents were excluded if they reported having suffered an illness with respiratory symptoms and fever. questionnaire was administered to a proxy, usually the child's parent or a close family member living in the same household. case-patients or their proxies were asked about exposures in the 7 days before illness onset. control-respondents were considered to be true control-respondents. injected into canine kidney cells for virus isolation. RT-PCR was used to identify influenza A H5. microneutralization assay conducted as previously described. a final model was achieved by entering the variables retained in the backward selection model. the population attributable risk percent (PAR%) was estimated as follows: PAR% = AR% proportion of case-patients exposed. microneutralization test results were considered positive if anti-H5 titer of >40 was obtained by 2 independent assays. mantel-Haenszel matched-pair analysis (McNemar test) was used to estimate the strength and statistical significance of associations between exposures and influenza A H5 infection. tributable risk percent (PAR%) was estimated as follows: PAR% = AR% proportion of case-patients exposed. all 28 cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A subtype H5. the presence of sick or dying poultry in the household (matched OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.7\u201359) or neighborhood (matched OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.0\u201355.7) was also statistically associated with infection as was the absence of an indoor water source in the household (matched OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.3\u201377.0) 0.001 Live poultry in neighborhood 19 (79) 75 (74)# 1.07 (0.2\u20136.6) 0.810 Sick or dead poultry in neighborhood 12 (43) 29 (27) 3.9 (1.0\u201355.7) 0.05 Farm or family with >150 poultry within 100 m 4 (14) 16 (15) 1.0 (0.2\u20134.2) 0.742 Household members work with commercial poultry 1 (4) 2 (2) 2.0 (0.0\u201338.4) 0.88 Other animal-related exposures Pigs in household 9 (32) 28 (26) eight variables with p0.2 were considered for inclusion in the conditional logistic regression model to estimate independence of effects. the presence of sick or dead poultry in the neighborhood was excluded from the final regression model because missing data for this variable led to the exclusion of 36 participants. the proportion of H5N1 cases attributable to this practice (AR%) is estimated in this study to be 89% ([(8.99 \u2013 1)/8.99] 100) stopping this practice would prevent only an estimated 28% of H5N1 cases (PAR% = 0.89 0.32) despite evidence that limited human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has occurred (3,5,12), we observed no significant differences between case-patients and control-respondents in terms of exposure to persons who might be a source of H5N1 infection. this finding is consistent with that of the case-control study in Thailand (9). study did not ask about consumption of sick or dead poultry because the gastrointestinal route of transmission was not considered plausible at the time the study was designed. an alternative explanation is that people without access to an indoor water source may acquire infection by drinking or washing in outdoor water sources contaminated with feces from infected poultry. the use of self-reported prior exposure to sick poultry is a major source of potential bias in this and other studies of risk factors for human H5N1 infection. this tool introduces a selection bias that favors finding greater exposure to sick poultry among case-patients than other groups. 5 of the 28 cases-patients (18%) did not report exposure to sick poultry, indicating that exposure was not a prerequisite for identification as a case-patient. the substantial delay between onset of illness and interviews (mean 35.7 days) is also a potential source of recall bias. it may be the consequence of a bias introduced by proxy respondents for deceased case-patients reporting higher levels of education than case-patients had actually achieved. no human cases of H5N1 infection have been directly attributed to exposure to contaminated water. environmental investigations are needed to sample water sources in and around households of incident H5N1 case-patients. 5 of the 28 cases-patients (18%) did not report exposure to sick poultry. the study may be underpowered to detect factors posing only a moderate risk for infection. a standardized questionnaire and trained interviewing staff were used to minimize bias. health and research Implications Preparing sick or dead poultry for consumption in an H5N1-affected area is a risky practice. stopping it would prevent only an estimated 28% of cases. studying intrinsic determinants of susceptibility will require pooling of data and samples from affected families across affected countries. inherited biologic factors, such as sialic acid receptor phenotype or immune response, may be determinants of infection and disease."}
