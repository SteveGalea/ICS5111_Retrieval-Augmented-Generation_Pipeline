{"summary": "influenza virus is responsible for annual epidemics that cause severe morbidity or death in approximately 5 million people worldwide. innate immune system relies on pattern recognition receptors to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) innate immune system relies on pattern recognition receptors to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) intranasally inoculated formalin-inactivated influenza virus vaccine induces protective immunity against homologous and heterologous viruses. a split influenza vaccine does not induce antigen-specific immunity when introduced intranasally. synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can restore immunogenicity of the vaccine by mimicking PAMPs. the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by intracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) derived from DNA viruses. dsDNA is essential for regulating caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1 and IL-18 in response to dsDNA and DNA viruses. asome via its non-structural protein, 2B, stimulates Ca2+ flux from intracellular storage sites into the cytosol. 2B proteins expressed by other picornaviruses, poliovirus, and enterovirus 71 also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. the NLRP3 recognizes disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations induced by viroporins from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), human rhinovirus (HRV), or influenza virus. the RNA helicase DHX33 binds to cytosolic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to trigger NL recognition of influenza virus by NLRP3 inflammasome does not limit early viral replication in the lung. NLRP3-inflammasomes activation and downstream IL-1R signaling events are found to be required to mount adaptive immune responses to influenza virus infection. vaccines for influenza virus, since heat- or ultraviolet-inactivated influenza virus does not activate inflammasomes. bystander DCs activated by inflammatory signals capture viral antigens. bystander DCs activated by inflammatory signals capture viral antigens. DNA vaccines have proved successful in pre-clinical and clinical trials. passive immune-prophylaxis using viral vectors or plasmids encoding neutralizing antibodies induces the long-term expression of antibodies at high concentrations. this provides effective protection against influenza virus or HIV infection [55-58] the number of DCs migrating from the lung to the mLNs was lower than that in water-fed mice after influenza virus infection. the administration of a TLR ligand, lipopolysaccharide, restored both the migration of respiratory DCs to mLNs and the virus-specific T cell responses."}
