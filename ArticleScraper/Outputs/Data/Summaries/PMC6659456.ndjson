{"summary": "recent studies indicated that Cxc chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) was associated with tumorigenesis. the present study investigated the role of the CXCL5/Cxc chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) bio-axis in ARDS. ARDS is characterized by progressive dyspnea with refractory hypoxemia. the pathological process of ARDS can be divided into 3 stages. cytokines and chemokines promote the pathological and physiological process of ARDS. CXCL5 is an inflammatory chemokine, which is a member of the same family as CXCL10 [15], which promotes the development of inflammation in ARDS. the role of CXCL5 in ARDS and its associated mechanisms are still unknown, as is whether it participates in the inflammatory process of ARDS by binding to its receptor CXCR2. 10 mice in the best time point of the LPS-induced group were randomly divided into an LPS+anti-CXCL5 group (n=5) and an LPS+IgG group (n=5) the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 g CXCL5 neutralizing antibody or 50 g IgG control. the wet-to-dry ratio of lung tissue was calculated for pulmonary edema score according to the lung injury score. the degree of pulmonary edema was determined by the pulmonary injury score according to the wet/dry ratio. fluoride (PVDF) membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody against CXCL5 (ab9983; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 1000), CXCR2 (ab14935; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 500), MMP2 (ab92536; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 1000), and MMP9 (ab38898; Cell Signal centrifuge tube mixed well with 0.6 ml isoamylol and allowed to stand for 5\u201310 min at room temperature. total RNA precipitate was suspended and dried at room temperature. qPCR was used as endogenous control for expression levels of mRNA. the relative quantification of gene expression was measured by the method of 2Cq. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. the mice in the LPS+anti-CXCL5 group were randomly divided into an LPS+anti-CXCL5 group (n=5) and an LPS+IgG group (n=5) mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 g CXCL5 neutralizing antibody or 50 g IgG control, respectively, at 1 h after LPS induction. the degree of pulmonary edema was determined by the pulmonary injury score according to wet/dry ratio. an ELISA kit was used to measure CXCL5 expression and IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and IL-10 expressions. membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody against CXCL5 (ab9983; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 1000), CXCR2 (ab14935; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 500), MMP2 (ab92536; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dilution, 1: 1000), and MMP9 (ab38898; Cell Signaling Technology, USA; dil total RNA precipitate was isolated from the lung tissue using a total RNA extraction kit (Beijing Tianenze Gene Technology Co., Beijing, China) we produced cDNA using a RT-qPCR kit (Hangzhou Bioer Technology Co., Zhejiang, China) t test was used to analyze difference between 2 groups. results LPS induced physiological response, lung pathological manifestations, and pulmonary edema in mice Mice in the normal saline control group showed no abnormal manifestations. expression of CXCL5 and CXCR2 in lung tissues of acute respiratory distress mice induced by LPS Blood was collected before the mice were killed. expression of CXCL5 in the LPS-induced group was higher than in the normal saline control group and increased with the extension of the induction time (4, 8, and 12 h) therefore, 12 h was selected as the induction time for the following experiments. expressions of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- were decreased in the LPS+CXCL5 group but were higher than in the normal saline control group. the expression of IL-10 was higher than in the normal saline control group, but lower than in the normal saline control group. no obvious difference in lung pathological change was found between the normal saline control group and the LPS+IgG group. the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues was higher in the LPS-12h group, while it was lower in the LPS+CXCL5 group. in the normal saline control group, mice showed significantly increased respiratory rate and heart rate, obvious cyanosis of the lips and limbs, slow reaction, and decreased activity with prolonged administration time. hematoxylin and eosin staining and pulmonary edema score were used to observe pathological changes of the lung tissues. the expression of CXCL5 and CXCR2 in lung tissues increased with the extension of the induction time (4, 8, and 12 h) therefore, 12 h was selected as the induction time for the following experiments. the expression of CXCL5 and CXCR2 and CXCL5 and CXCR2 in lung tissues increased in the LPS-12h group compared with the normal saline control group. the changes of pulmonary edema were observed by calculating the wet-to-dry ratio of lung tissue. pulmonary edema in the LPS+CXCL5 group was alleviated, but it was slightly more serious than in the normal saline control group. the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues were determined by Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses in the normal saline control group, the LPS-12h group, the LPS+CXCL5 group, and the LPS+IgG group. the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues was higher in the LPS-12h group, while it was lower than in the LPS+CXCL5 group. inflammation is an essential factor in the development of ARDS. chemokines appear to be present in almost all processes of tumor progression. a previous study showed that CXCL5 was involved in acute bacterial pneumonia. the role of CXCL5 in ARDS may be mediated by CXCR2. the activation of MMP2 and MMP9 is involved in alveolar macrophages during acute lung injury. this can exacerbate pulmonary inflammation in inflammatory processes."}
