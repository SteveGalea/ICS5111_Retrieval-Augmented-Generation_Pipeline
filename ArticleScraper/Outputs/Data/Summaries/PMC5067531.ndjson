{"summary": "introduction A disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAM) are membrane-anchored cell surface proteins containing both disintegrin and metalloproteinase domains. they belong to the adamalysin protein family in the zinc protease superfamily. by 2010, 40 ADAM homologs had been identified in the mammalian genome. a few cases have shown a rare syndrome in which patients with a homozygous mutation present severe diarrhea, skin rashes and recurrent sepsis. the sheddase is also involved in various pathological processes such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, cardiac failure, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and hypertension. the structure and structure-based modulation of ADAM17 are also described for better understanding of the various ADAM17 regulatory pathways in different cell types or tissues. we also discuss the contribution of ADAM17 as a potential therapeutic target in cardiovascular disorder and the neurogenic component of these cardiovascular diseases. Ser791 has been shown as cytoplasmic desphosphorylation site. the pro-domain of ADAM17 includes a cysteine switch box. removal of the pro-domain is a pre-requisite for ADAM17 activation. ADAM17 translocates to the cell surface to perform proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions. the pro-domain is highly sensitive to proteolysis, once detached from catalytic domain. changes in conformation, mediated by the cysteine-rich domain, result in reducing affinity between pro- and catalytic domains. soluble ADAM17 forms, lacking trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domain, can cleave trans-membrane proteins or synthetic peptide substrates but not very efficiently. switching the transmembrane domain of TGF with that of L-selectin actually restored cleavage activity of the transmembrane switched ADAM17. cholesterol-enriched microdomain is thought to be an important micro-environment. depletion of membrane cholesterol by methyl-cyclodextrin can induce ADAM17-dependent shedding. cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 is thought to be required for regulation of metalloprotease activity via several intracellular signals. phosphorylation of ADAM17 at Thr735 highlights a key step in inducible ADAM17 protein trafficking and maturation. protein kinase C (PKC) used to be considered as an upstream signal of ERK/MAPK pathway, but it may also have direct role in ADAM17 phosphorylation. ionomycin (a calcium ionophore) increased the level of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) shedding in mice. however, it is still unclear whether other ADAM might contribute to this process. iRhom1 and iRhom2 are involved in the maturation of ADAM17. notch receptor is cleaved by ADAM17 at site 2 (S2) and then by -secretase at site 3 (S3) both murine Notch1 and Notch2 require ADAM17 instead of ADAM10 during ligand-independent activation. in adult epidermis, ADAM17 permits tonic Notch activation to regulate epithelial cytokine production and maintain barrier immunity. the up-regulation of EGFR by ADAM17 stems from the critical ability of this metalloprotease to cleave multiple EGFR ligands, such as EGF itself, TGF; epiregulin; heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) neuregulins 1 and 2 are considered critical to cardiac development. neuregulin-1 cleavage mediated by ADAM17 can negatively regulate myelination in the peripheral nervous system. notch receptor and its ligand Delta-l1 are required for neuroepithelial development during embryogenesis. notch1 promotes differentiation of progenitor cells into astroglia. ADAM17 permits notch activation to regulate epithelial cytokine production. notch signaling is initiated by receptor-ligand recognition between adjacent cells. overexpression of ADAM17 can promote angiogenesis by increasing blood vessel sprouting. quadruple knockout mice lacking ADAM 9, 12, 15, and 17 do not have a more severe phenotype than mice lacking only ADAM17. removal of ADAM17 from subcortical white matter led to abnormalities in Schwann myelination causing impaired motor behaviors. increased expression of TNF and ADAM17 had important implications in advanced cardiac dysfunction in myocarditis. in the myocardium, TNF contributes to irreversible ischemia/reperfusion injury, post myocardial infarction remodeling, and heart failure development. the association between ADAM17 and cardiac function is not limited to local effects in the heart. Akatsu et al. (2003) demonstrated an increased expression of TNF and ADAM17 in circulating leukocytes of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with higher plasma TNF levels compared with healthy control patients. ADAM17 activity is correlated to adverse clinical outcomes in acute coronary atherosclerosis. adhesion molecules include ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), L-selectin. ADAM17 showed a restricted pattern of distribution in the telencephalon and diencephalon. within the mesencephalon, ADAM17 mRNA was detected in the hippocampus along with the inferior colliculus. ADAM17 mRNA was also detected in the cerebellar cortex, pontine nuclei, and cerebral cortex. e and cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into soluble APP fragment. this shedding of APP is able to reduce the generation of neurotoxic amyloid (A) peptide. ADAM17 is also a neuro-inflammatory target which responds to ischemia and other stress factors. ADAM17-mediated shedding is a critical trigger for pro-inflammatory signaling of TNF. BB1101, a blocker of ADAM17, was shown to be effective in reducing TNF levels in stressed animal models. excitation or stimulations targeting glutamatergic neurons may cause up-regulation of ADAM17 activity. ADAM17 regulates L1CAM (L1-cell adhesion molecule)-dependent neuronal cell adhesion, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth. ADAM17-mediated shedding is important to neuronal outgrowth in the developmental process. L1CAM has been observed in late embryonic/early postnatal cortical neurons and fibers in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract. knocking-down ADAM17 could affect L1-involed neuronal intermediate progenitor cells multipolar exit and migration. K\u00fcper et al. (2007) were the first to suggest a co-dependency between ADAM17-mediated up-regulation of EGFR and TNF. they observed that within renal collecting duct cells LPS induces EGFR activation via TLR4/ADAM17. this promotes myocardial TNF production and cardiac failure. in the vasculature ADAM17 expression is found throughout endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes. the consequences of shedding events for vascular biology depend on the type of substrate shed. ADAM17 activity is correlated to adverse clinical outcomes in acute coronary atherosclerosis. it has been reported that ADAM17 null leukocytes present increase L-selectin levels. nitric oxide (NO) is a critical factor involved in ADAM17 activation. this might explain increased adhesion of leukocytes in dysfunctional endothelium. astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells may have a role in normal brain function. increased plasma ADAM17 activity was found in patients with mild cognitive impairment. the pro-inflammatory activity of TNF is predominantly mediated by TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1) and to some extent by TNF receptor type 2 (TNFR2). either ADAM17 expression or activity have found to be altered in neuro-inflammatory conditions. conditional deletion of the ADAM17 gene or inhibition of the protein effectively blocks LPS-induced TNF release and systemic inflammation in mice. decreased TNF is mediated by hepatocyte growth factor-like protein-induced decrease in NFB activation. inflammation is also characterized by elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) ADAM17 is the main sheddase for IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) to induce IL-6 trans-signaling. circulating leukocytes migrate into the brain within 4\u20136 h after ischemia. ADAM17-related adhesion procedure is critical during inflammation process. shedding is important to neuronal outgrowth in developmental process. Ang-II can induce VSMC hypertrophy, proliferation and migration. ADAM17-induced EGFR transactivation is considered a major contributor in Ang-II-induced vascular remodeling. underlying mechanism is probably EGFR signaling stimulated by EGFR ligands released by ADAM17 from endothelial cells. selective inhibition of ADAM17 could be beneficial for treatment of diseases implied in pathological neovascularization. fatty acids in LDL particles are also involved in ADAM17 activation in the endothelial layer. this is due to increase in membrane fluidity, creating a link between endothelial dysfunction/atherosclerosis and increase in ADAM17 substrates in patients at risk. in brain injury and tumor, an important role for ADAM17 has gradually become clear. a-bearing nude mice targeting ADAM17 with TAPI-2 (an ADAM17 inhibitor) or siRNA can significantly attenuate tumor growth and invasiveness, compared to their untreated counterparts. TGF plays a key role in the regulation of glioma formation and progression. ADAM17-induced EGFR transactivation is considered a major contributor in Ang-II-induced vascular remodeling. it induces expression of fibronectin and transforming growth factor- (TGF) this occurs via downstream signaling of EGFR transactivation and ER stress. this occurs via a signaling mechanism involving ADAM17-mediated shedding which is independent of hypertension. VEGFR type 2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor which is considered the principal coordinator of adult angiogenesis. this receptor can be shed from cells by ADAM17, resulting in shedding of VEGFR2 and other ADAM17 substrates. this could limit angiogenesis process and reveal potential novel target for treatment of pathological neovascularization associated to atherosclerosis. therosclerosis and increase in ADAM17 substrates in brain injury and tumor Over the years, an important role for ADAM17 has gradually become clear. shedding of TGF, ADAM17 can work as the constitutive sheddase of epiregulin and amphiregulin, both members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family playing important roles in regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. the mechanism of TGF-induced tumor formation and progression is not simply mediated by activation of the downstream EGFR pathway. however, the mechanism of TGF-induced tumor formation and progression is not simply mediated by activation of the downstream EGFR pathway. ACE2 is able to cleave Ang-I to produce Ang-(1\u20137). neuronal overexpression of ACE2 has therapeutic effects on Ang-II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ACE2 ectodomain is cleaved from the cell membrane by ADAM17. this further fuels the involvement of ADAM17 in cardiac hypertrophy. inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-2 does not decrease systolic blood pressure in Ang II-infused mice. this suggests that cardiac ADAM17 actually contributes to the development of neurogenic hypertension. overactivity of the brain RAS is a major contributor to the development and maintenance of neurogenic hypertension. ACE2 ectodomain in a dose- and time-dependent manner. interaction between ACE2 and ACE2 decreased in mice with DOCA-salt hypertension. the structure of CaM can be expanded by its specific Ca2+ binding sites. this could render ACE2 vulnerable to shedding activity of ADAM17. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the RAS hydrolyzes Ang-I into the potent vasoconstrictor Ang-II. ACE2 is able to cleave Ang-I to produce Ang-(1\u20137). ACE2 over-expression protects the heart from Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. the compensatory role of ACE2 is compromised, as it is a subject of ADAM17-mediated shedding. ACE2 ectodomain is cleaved from the cell membrane by ADAM17. Ang-II-induced ADAM17 activation with preservation of ACE2 and attenuated Ang-II-mediated cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. in the brain RAS Lautrette et al. (2005) demonstrated that peripheral inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-2 does not decrease systolic blood pressure in Ang II-infused mice. overactivity of the brain RAS is a major contributor to the development and maintenance of neurogenic hypertension. in ACE2-expressed HEK cells, calmodulin (CaM) interacts with ACE2. inhibiting CaM increased the release of the ACE2 ectodomain in a dose- and time-dependent manner. this association between ACE2 and ACE2 has also been reported in the CNS. can control the transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which in turn mediated angiotensin-II (Ang-II)-induced hypertension in mice independently of cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. the main targets of the shedding induced by ADAM17 described in the text. both ADAM17 and TIMP3 have high abundance in the heart, kidney and brain. mice with TIMP3 deficiency show significant increase in ADAM17 activity. this is believed to be responsible for Ang-II-induced vascular inflammation and remodeling. existing knockout models are amenable for conditional, pre- or post-developmental, deletion of neuronal ADAM17, making them attractive for in vivo studies in adult animals devoid of gross anatomical defects. the global knockout model may be useful for studies focusing on the physiological role of ADAM17.
