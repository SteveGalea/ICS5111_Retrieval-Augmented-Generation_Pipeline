{"summary": "mumps is a highly contagious disease with mild symptoms, such as fever, headache, and uni- or bilateral parotitis. mumps can result in complications like meningitis or orchitis (7, 8). so far, humans are the only known host of muV. muV has been shown to bind to erythrocytes from different mammalian and avian species. but the binding activity of muV HN has not been studied in detail. the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm is mediated by the action of the muV fusion protein (F), which induces the fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. the viral proteins synthesized in transfected cells were analyzed for functional activity. the surface glycoproteins F and HN of batMuV are able to mediate syncytium formation following coexpression. the phenotype of the syncytia is determined by the signal peptides of the respective F proteins. a conservation score of 0 for an amino acid residue (aa) at a certain position was considered a conservation level of 0%, while a conservation score of 10 indicated a conservation level of 100% for the respective aa. chiropteran cells derived from different species and organs were used in this study. ypsignathus monstrosus lung cells (28), and EidNi/41 cells (Eidolon helvum kidney cells, mixed culture) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. all cells were cultivated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the DNA was cloned into the expression vector pCG1 (30) chimeric muV fusion proteins with an exchange of the F1 subunit (batMuVF2; batMuV F, aa 1 to 102; hMuV F, aa 103 to 538; hMuVF2, hMuV F aa 1 to 102; batMuV F, aa 103 to 538) were generated by hybridization PCR (sequences for hybridization primers are available upon request) cells were grown on coverslips and transfected for expression of muV glycoproteins. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20133% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with either of the following primary antibodies. cells were transfected with the empty vector (pCG1) or with expression plasmids for human- or bat-derived MuV F (rows a to d) or HN (row e) the proteins were detected in permeabilized cells using muV-specific primary antibodies: (row a) anti-mumps F 2117, (row b) anti-mumps F 5418, (row c) anti-mumps IA F, (row d) anti-mumps cells were cotransfected with the HA epitope-labeled constructs and the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to evaluate transfection efficiency. the cells next were fixed by incubation with PBS-3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. the cells were washed again to remove residual paraformaldehyde. cells were washed and detached from the bottom of the plates using a cell scraper. first, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 g and 4\u00b0C for 5 min. this washing step was repeated three times before the cells were resuspended in PBSM\u20131% BSA containing anti-HA antibody (rabbit; 1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), again for 1 h on an overhead shaker. at 18 h p.t., the medium was removed and the cells were washed carefully with PBS three times, followed by incubation with 250 l PBS containing 2% chicken erythrocytes. the cells were fixed with PBS\u20133% paraformaldehyde and analyzed via light microscopy. itative neuraminidase activity assay was performed at least five times. cells were grown in 24-well plates and cotransfected for the expression of human- or bat-derived MuV F and HN proteins. at 12 h p.t., the medium was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS. permeabilized cells first were incubated with antibodies directed against the F protein of the Enders strain (F-5418 mouse) and the HN protein of the SBL-1 strain (both Life Technologies) only syncytia with a minimum of five nuclei were considered, and the assay was performed at least five times. AB823535.1, JN012242.1, KF481689.1, AF280799.1, EU370207.1, JN635498.1, JX287385.1, JX287391.1, and JX287387.1 were analyzed using the PRofile ALIgNEment software. a conservation score of 0 for an amino acid residue (aa) at a certain position was considered a conservation level of 0%. clonal cell line produced from mixed culture (HypNi/1) (27), HypLu/2 (Hypsignathus monstrosus lung cells, mixed culture) (28), and EidNi/41 cells (Eidolon helvum kidney cells, mixed culture) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. all cells were cultivated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37\u00b0 hMuV HN for, AAGGCCGTCGACTTAGTACCTGATGAGATC; hMuV HN for, AAGGCCGTCGACTTAGTACCTGATGAGATC; and hMuV HN for, AAGGCCGTCGACTTAGTACCTGATGAGATC. chimeric muV fusion proteins with an exchange of the F1 subunit (batMuVF2; batMuV F, aa 1 to 102 the ICAFectin 441 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. cells were grown on coverslips and transfected for expression of muV glycoproteins. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20133% paraformaldehyde. immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and NIS Elements AR software (Nikon) cells were transfected with the empty vector (pCG1) or with expression plasmids for human- or bat-derived MuV F (rows a to d) or HN (row e) hMuV F, batMuV F, hMuV F SP, and batMuV F SP cells were cotransfected with the HA epitope-labeled constructs and the pEGFP-N1 vector. the cells next were fixed by incubation with PBS-3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. the cells next were fixed by incubation with PBS-3% paraformaldehyde. at 24 h p.t., cells were washed and detached from the bottom of the plates using a cell scraper. the cells next were transferred to reaction tubes, and all future washing steps were performed as follows. the cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 g and 4\u00b0C for 5 min. HypNi/1.1 cells were transfected with either plasmids for expression of HN from hMuV or batMuV, respectively, or with the empty vector pCG1. at 18 h p.t., the medium was removed and the cells were washed carefully with PBS three times, followed by incubation with 250 l PBS containing 2% chicken erythrocytes. neuraminidase activity was measured by a GENios pro chemiluminometer. cells were grown in 24-well plates and cotransfected for the expression of human- or bat-derived MuV F and HN proteins. the cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed by incubation with ice-cold methanol-acetone (1:1, vol/vol) for 30 s. the cells were then washed with aqua bidest, air dried, and analyzed via light microscopy for presence of syncytia. a rabbit antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic tail of MuV F also recognized both F proteins. a similar result was obtained with Vero76 cells. this result indicates that the F proteins of hMuV and batMuV are serologically related. transfected HypNi/1.1 cells were transfected with the empty vector or expression plasmids for either hMuV HN or batMuV HN. at 18 h p.t., the cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C with chicken erythrocytes that either were left untreated (NA) or that had been pretreated with C. perfringens neuraminidase (+NA). expressing either of the MuV proteins showed a decreased binding of erythrocytes when incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. one hour after the temperature shift, no bound erythrocytes were detectable. an influenza virus HA of the subtype H9 was included as a control. nonpermeabilized cells were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against the HN protein of the SBL-1 strain of MuV. by this approach, a stronger surface expression was detected with hMuV HN than with the batMuV HN. by this approach, a stronger surface expression was detected with hMuV HN than with the batMuV HN. chiropteran (HypNi/1.1, HypLu/2, and EidNi/41), human (HeLa), simian (Vero76) and rodent (BHK-21) cells were cotransfected to express the batMuV F and HN proteins. only giant cells with a minimum of five nuclei were considered syncytia. hMuV proteins were detected by subsequent incubation with anti-MuV F-5418 and Alexa Flour 488 goat anti-mouse antibodies. muV HN proteins were detected by incubation with anti-MuV HN(CT) and Alexa Flour 568 goat anti-rabbit antibodies. at 12 h p.t., the cells were fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1) and incubated in may Gr\u00fcnwald and Gie the size of the syncytia induced by the batMuV glycoproteins did not increase significantly at later times p.t. a heterologous fusion assay was performed to find out whether human- and bat-derived MuV glycoproteins are able to interact with each other. a striking difference was observed in the first 20 amino acids of the F2 subunit comprising the putative signal peptide. there, at the amino terminus of F2, the homology between the MuV consensus sequence and batMuV was only 69%. chimeric F proteins with an exchange of the first 20 (putative SP) or 102 (F2 subunit) amino acids were generated. hMuV F designates the fusion protein of the clinical isolate used in this study. b hMuV F designates the fusion protein of the clinical isolate used in this study. at 12 h p.t., cells were fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1) and incubated in may Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa staining solution. the scale bar indicates 50 m. to determine if the hMuV F SP enables more efficient protein processing and transport. the percentage of cells which express hMuV F-HA or hMuV F SP-HA on the surface was higher than that of the cells which express batMuV F-HA or batMuV F SP-HA. for batMuV F-HA and batMuV F SP-HA, most of the cells showed lower fluorescence intensities. histogram plots of hMuV F, hMuV F SP, batMuV F, and batMuV F SP surface expression in pCG1-transfected cells. the gray curve represents the gate setting of pCG1-transfected cells. expression of bat-derived MuV F and HN glycoproteins in mammalian cells. transfected HypNi/1.1 cells expressing either of the HN proteins were incubated with a 2% chicken erythrocyte suspension. no hemadsorption was observed with control cells transfected with an empty vector. cells expressing the HN proteins of either hMuV or batMuV bound erythrocytes that could not be washed away. the neuraminidase of batMuV is known for its neuraminidase activity. transfected cells were subjected to a hemadsorption assay. they were incubated at 37\u00b0C to enable the neuraminidase of the HN proteins to cleave sialic acids. incubation of transfected HypNi/1.1 cells expressing the HN protein of hMuV showed an enzyme activity similar to that observed when the substrate was incubated with 10 U of purified neuraminidase from C. perfringens NA. the enzyme activity of the batMuV HN protein was lower than that of hMuV HN. the emission at a wavelength of 460 nm was measured after excitation at a wavelength of 355 nm. the cells were transfected with the empty vector (pCG1), hMuV HN, or batMuV HN. the insets show nuclei visualized by DAPI staining. HypNi/1.1 cells were transfected for the single expression of hMuV and batMuV F or HN proteins. cotransfected cells were stained with may Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa staining solution to visualize syncytium formation. at 12 h p.t., the cells were fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1) and incubated in may Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa staining solution. the batMuV glycoproteins also were able to mediate fusion in all chiropteran and nonchiropteran cell lines. however, the size of the syncytia induced by the batMuV glycoproteins did not increase significantly at later times p. homologous expression of hMuV F and HN proteins was smaller than those observed after homologous expression. the signal peptide of the muV fusion proteins determines the size of the syncytia. the amino acid sequence of batMuV F was compared to that of a consensus sequence derived from 26 full-length sequences of human muV F. homology of hMuV F and batMuV F was compared to that of an aa sequence of the F proteins of 26 MuV strains. the homology was derived from an alignment of the aa sequence of the F proteins of 26 MuV strains. the black arrowhead indicates the cleavage site. hMuV F chimera and muV HN proteins were coexpressiond. hMuV F SP, signal peptide, ED, ectodomain; TD, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. the fluorescence observed with the cells expressing the batMuV F-HA or batMuV F SP-HA appeared to be reduced both with respect to the fluorescence intensity and to the number of fluorescent cells. the mean number of GFP-positive cells, given as a percentage of the total cell number, was similar between all samples. nonpermeabilized (TX) cells were incubated with anti-HA rabbit antibodies. cells next were permeabilized (+TX) and incubated with anti-HA mouse antibodies. cells next were permeabilized (+TX) and incubated with anti-HA mouse antibodies. an infectious batMuV is not yet available. it remains to be considered that there are batMuV variants which are less serologically related to human strains. the presence of neuraminidase activity of the surface-expressed batMuV HN was lower than that of the hMuV counterpart. this finding can be explained by the lower expression level of the batMuV HN protein, suggesting that the specific enzyme activities of the hMuV and batMuV proteins are similar. syncytium formation induced by the bat virus glycoproteins was substantially smaller than those observed after coexpression of the glycoproteins of hMuV. similar difference has been demonstrated recently when the syncytium formation by a putative African henipavirus was compared to that induced by the Nipah virus glycoproteins. aviruses and bat influenza viruses are restricted at the level of interaction with cellular receptors (35), and the African henipavirus and batMuV are restricted in their fusion activity (33) replication of the respective bat viruses may not be characterized by production of a large number of progeny virions but rather by a persistent type of infection."}
