{"summary": "mucosal membranes comprise the linings of gastrointestinal, urogenital and respiratory tracts. they are actually the portal of entry for more than 80% of infectious disease pathogens. mucosal tissues in a healthy human body comprise as much as 80% of all lymphocytes. this results in the generation of antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cell-dependent IgA responses, and T helper 1 (Th1) cell- and CTL-dependent immune responses. the homing behavior of these cells is mainly attributed to the up-regulated expression of site-specific adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors that guide the cells back to mucosa. oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a live-attenuated strain with spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. OPV elicits neutralizing antibodies to prevent the spread of poliovirus to the nervous system, but also induces excellent sIgA response in the intestinal mucosa. fluMist was approved by the fda in 2003 and became available on the market in the same year. the current version of CAIV-T is a refrigerator-stable formulation of fluMist\u00ae. it contains components of live attenuated influenza viruses of each of the three strains for the 2009\u20132010 season. the intestine appears to be a major target for SIV replication. the gut-associated lymphocytes contain about 40% of the total lymphocytes. similar findings were made in macaques infected with human/simian immunodeficiency virus harboring CCR5-tropic HIV-1 envelope. 80% of heterosexual infections apparently initiated by a single variant when HIV-1 is transmitted into a new recipient [27,28]. the initial founder populations define a small window of maximum vulnerability for the virus. the depletion of memory CD4+ T cells, especially in the gut during the acute phase of infection, provide further evidence that the induction of mucosal immunity should be considered a high priority. mucosal IgA derived from highly exposed seronegative individuals was able to block HIV-1 epithelial transcytosis and neutralized CD4+ cell infection. a recent study indicated that anti-CCR5 IgG and IgA might have contributed to protection against HIV-1 sexual transmission among exposed seronegative people [38]. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes play a crucial role in suppressing SIV replication in vivo during acute and chronic infections [43,44]. based on a mathematical model, it has been suggested that the first T cell response to transmitted/founder viruses in humans is early and contributes to the initial decline of plasma virus in acute infection. cellular immune responses detected are essential for preventing local productive infection and eliminating the initial founder populations of infected cells. studies in macaques found that immunization with a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine can induce specific local CTLs in mucosa and dramatically reduce viremia after mucosal challenge with SIV. other viral vectors are under investigation for stimulating mucosal immunity, such as live attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus. intranasal co-delivery of MVA-HIV plus adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) significantly enhanced the cellular and humoral immune response against HIV-1 antigens at the mucosal surfaces of vaccinated mice. cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-12, IL-18 and GM-CSF have been evaluated as substitute for the induction of systemic and mucosal CTL after nasal immunization. a heterologous DNA/MVA vaccine regimen showed a similar level of protection in monkeys [74]. it remains unknown whether or not a much better protection could be achieved after vaccinia or other vector systems are further optimized for stimulating host mucosal immune responses. MVTT-S induced more than 100-fold higher Nab response than MVA-S. if we compare the levels of Nabs elicited via the i.n. and i.o. immunizations, MVTT-S induced more than 100-fold higher Nab response than MVA-S did in this experiment. the failure of Merck\u2019s rAd5-based HIV-1 vaccine has called for efforts to further study HIV-1 immunology and vaccinology. this is a critical area of investigation because the magnitude and timing of the establishment of an excess of effector cells versus targets were found to be essential to the mucosal transmission of HIV-1. a prime-boost combination of two AIDS vaccine candidates has shown partial efficacy. those administered with the combination vaccine have a 31% increased chance of preventing infection with HIV-1. the AIDS vaccine research and development remain a long march."}
