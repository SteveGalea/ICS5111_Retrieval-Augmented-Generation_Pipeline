{"summary": "coiled-coil stability calculations were performed using the computer program COILS2. dihedral angles were determined using the same program. Mutant HAs were generated using the method of Kunkel et al. (1987) on wild-type (wt)-HA (X:31 strain) cDNA in the plasmid pSM. 293T cells were transfected with pCB6-HA when plates were 50% confluent. a total of 5 g DNA (pCB6-HA plus carrier pCB6) was transfected per 6-cm plate. unless stated, all cells were treated 16 h before analysis. trypsin-treated cells were then incubated for 10 min with RPMI or PBS. higher concentrations of trypsin (10 g/ml) were used where noted to increase the amount of cleaved HA at the cell surface. proteinase K Digestion Cells expressing wt- and mutant HA0s were treated with trypsin to cleave HA0. HA-expressing cells were then incubated in MES-saline at the indicated pH for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the digestion was stopped by adding 0.5 g/ml BSA, 1 mM PMSF, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. samples from metabolically labeled cells were then precipit immunocomplexes were bound to protein A agarose (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis. electrophoresis, Western Blot, and Phosphorimager analysis Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% gels. ein AM\u2013labeled RBCs, at 0.05% vol/vol for COS 7 cells, were added to the HA-expressing cells for 20 min at RT. cell monolayers were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with pH 5 fusion buffer (10 mM MES, 10 mM Hepes, 120 mM NaCl, 10 mM succinate, and 2 mg/ml glucose) in specified experiments, the pH was adjusted as indicated. a baseline was obtained, the samples were brought to pH 5.2. the increase in fluorescence (fluorescence dequenching) was monitored. the percent fluorescence dequenching was calculated relative to the total fluorescence obtained after solubilizing each sample in 0.5% NP-40. HA2 80 is in a coiled-coil in both the pH 7 (in the first turn) as well as the pH 5 structure. the native HA structure are shown in Fig. 1 A. wt score = 1.62 for wild-type X:31 HA2 54\u201381 and mutant in neutral-pH crystal structure. wt score = 1.62 for wt-HA2 residues 54\u201381. a mutation that affects the height of the energy barrier between the two states would be predicted to change the kinetics of fusion. a mutation that affects the height of the energy barrier between the two states would be predicted to change the kinetics of fusion. wt- and mutant HA cDNAs were expressed in COS 7 cells. parallel cultures were treated with dMM, an inhibitor of terminal glycosylation, since recent experiments indicate certain HA mutants acquire excess terminal carbohydrates in HA1. plasmids encoding wt- and mutant HAs were transfected with dMM. gel samples were prepared in sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT. gel was analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-HA antiserum. all of the HA0s were transported to the cell surface in a form that could be cleaved from HA0 to HA1 and HA2. the latter mutants were either less efficiently delivered to the cell surface or less efficiently cleaved from HA0 to HA1 and HA2. the gradients were fractionated, and samples were precipitated with Con A\u2013agarose, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for HA protein as described in the legend to Fig. 2. mutations in HA2 54\u201381 can affect the glycosylation pattern of HA, likely by affecting the packing of the globular head domains. mutations appear to affect susceptibility to trypsin activation. 71 mutants behaved identically to wt-HA. mutants with Gly or Pro at positions 55 or 80 were completely sensitive to proteinase K. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt-, Pro- and Gly. single point mutant HAs were treated with 10 g/ml trypsin before low-pH treatment. this antibody effectively detects low pH\u2013treated wt-HA in cell lysates. HA acquires reactivity to this antibody with a very similar time course and pH dependence to that with which it acquires reactivity. ally labeled, treated with 5 g/ml trypsin, incubated at different pH values for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, reneutralized, and lysed in an NP-40 cell lysis buffer. the results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that all of the Ala mutants, as well as the Ala, Gly, and Pro mutants at position 71, changed conformation at low pH. wt- and pro-substituted HAs were bound to the cells for 25 min at RT. unbound RBCs were removed and the cells were incubated in fusion buffer (pH 5) for (A) 2 or (B) 10 min at 37\u00b0C, reneutralized, and observed with a fluorescence microscope. cells expressing wt-HA induced transfer of R18 at pH 5. S71P and L80P induced efficient transfer of R18 at pH 5. extent of syncytia formation with V55P appeared less than for wt-HA and the other mutants. fusion activity of 293T cells expressing different amounts of wt- and V55P-HA was slow compared with wt-HA. the rate of fusion for V55P was considerably slower than for wt-HA. wt- and V55P-HA cells were transfected with the indicated amount of plasmids encoding wt- or V55P-HA. the relative initial rate of fusion of V55P was found to be 20\u201340% that of wt-HA. tuted mutants showed the same approximate pH dependence of fusion (lipid mixing) as wt-HA. fusion became apparent in all cases at pH 5.2 and 5.0. similar results were obtained for the Ala-substituted mutants. asterisks in the eighth and tenth rows indicate a decrease in fusion that correlated with a reduced level of cleaved HA at the cell surface. in the eighth and tenth rows, indicates decreased fusion activity for V55P after normalization for cell surface expression. d HAs were prepared for fusion, incubated with calcein AM\u2013labeled RBCs. the mutant was not expressed at a detectable level on the cell surface. the mutant was readily cleaved by trypsin from HA0 to HA. it bound RBCs, reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site. none of the 10 HA coiled-coil mutants appeared to be severely altered in pH 7 structure. mutants were excessively terminally glycosylated (in the absence of dMM), presumably because their globular head domains are not packed exactly as in wt-HA. we invoke the phenotype of the double Pro-substituted mutant, V55P/S71P, as our strongest evidence for the importance of the spring-loaded conformational change. no fusion is observed with V55P/S71P for at least 1 h at pH 5 and 37\u00b0C. the mutant proteins were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and analyzed by circular dichroism. the predicted order of helix-forming potential would be: wt > S71P > L80P > V55P > V55P/S71P. the only difference between the predictions is the relative rankings of V55P and L80P. a segment containing HA2 80 in wt-HA likely did not have to convert from a random into a helical structure at low pH. a residue at the COOH-terminal end may not significantly influence the transition to the low-pH form. we recently isolated an influenza virus mutant with the substitution HA1 K27E. the proximity of HA1 27 to HA2 54 suggests the importance of the NH2-terminal end of the spring-loaded coiled-coil region for fusion activation. the second model proposes that the spring-loaded conformational change, the loop to helix transition of HA2 residues 55\u201376 (Carr and Kim, 1993; Bullough et al., 1994) is required for fusion. we now add our findings with V55P and V55P/S71P as support for a role for the spring-loaded conformational change model. most of the experiments in the latter studies were performed in the absence of target membranes. but recent studies with both HA and hernandez et al. have provided clear evidence for differences in the conformational changes of viral fusion proteins at membrane surfaces. we interpret our results with V55P/S71P and V55P in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change, the loop to helix transition of HA2 55\u2013 76, is required for fusion. additional electron microscopic, biophysical, structural, and mutational studies will be necessary to prove this hypothesis. a variety of peptide inhibition and mutagenesis studies have supported the hypothesis that the (predicted) coiled-coil regions of these proteins are important for fusion. there are three trivial possibilities: the first is due to differences in the analyses performed. fusion proteins of retro-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses induce fusion at neutral pH. fusion reactions are or appear to be triggered by interactions with virus receptors instead of low pH. conformational changes of 'neutral-pH' fusion proteins could be thermodynamically controlled. virus and Semliki Forest virus either do not (Rey et al., 1995) or are not predicted to contain regions of high coiled-coil propensity. it will therefore be interesting to learn whether any cellular fusion proteins are activated by spring-loaded conformational changes."}
