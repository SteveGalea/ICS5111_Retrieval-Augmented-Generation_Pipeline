{"summary": "all of the respiratory samples collected in this study were used for nested PCR analysis. of the 993 respiratory specimens, 127 (12.8%) were positive for HAdV. six strains segregated as a novel HAdV-C subtype in a phylogenetic analysis. the genome contains 35,926 bp with a GC content of 55.2%. the plus strand had an overall base composition of 23.16% A, 27.96% C, 27.25% G, and 21.63% T. a novel HAdV-C subtype (CBJ113) circulating in china has been identified. s of the hexon and fiber genes showed the highest sequence similarity between strains CBJ113 and HAdV-2, with identities of 98.8299.71%. on the other hand, the CBJ113 strain shared higher identities with a representative HAdV-1 strain in the penton base (99.77%), pVI (99.87%), and DBP (98.92%) genes. HAdV-5 and HAdV-6 showed the greatest 98.43% 97.9% 97.89% Complete genome 95.52% 99.22% 94.7% 97.35% 96.8% The GenBank accession numbers of the representative strains are AC_000017 for HAdV-C1, AC_000008 for HAdV-C5, HQ413315 for HAdV-C6 and HQ003817 for HAdV-C57. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been used as molecular markers to distinguish different lineages in the typing of some viruses15,16. there are 158 representative SNPs presented in Fig. 5 which were lineage specific and could be used as markers to distinguish different subtypes. phylogenetic analyses of several functional genes of HAdV-C strain CBJ113. genes assessed include fiber, hexon, penton, 100K, DBP, DNA polymerase, E1B, pVI and E4orf1. all of the respiratory samples collected in this study were analyzed. all 47 HAdV-C strains detected in this study and five typical sequences (indicated with solid circles) of HAdV-C were analyzed using 1000 bootstrap replicates implement. a novel subtype (6 strains) was detected in china. a novel HAdV-C subtype (CBJ113) circulating in china has been identified. one novel HAdV-C subtype (indicated in red) and 12 other HAdV representative strains were analyzed using bootstrap. region % nucleotide identity CBJ113 strain HAdV-C1 HAdV-C2 HAdV-C5 HAdV-C6 HAdV-C57 E1B 98.91% 99.8% 98.5% 99.66% 99.12% DNA polymerase 98.76% 99.55% 99.38% 99.86% 98.87% penton base 99.77% 99.24% 98.35% 9 the results showed that CBJ113 is a recombinant harboring the penton base gene of HAdV-1 and the hexon and fiber genes of HAdV-2. partial sequence of DNA polymerase and E4orf1 may have derived from HAdV-6 and HAdV-5, separately. the results coincided with BootScan and phylogenetic analyses. the results indicated that CBJ113 arose from intratypic recombination events. adenoviruses are ubiquitous in the environment and they are a frequent cause of respiratory infection or even life-threatening infection in children. recombination was a hallmark of adenovirus genetics and frequent natural recombination has important implication for viral detection and pathogenicity. s belonged to the novel recombinant HAdV-C, accounting for 4.7% of all HAdV-positive cases. more accurate epidemiological data are needed to investigate the HAdV population. circulating HAdV types in china were consistent with genetic recombinant type. adenovirus identification and isolation For molecular detection, nucleic acid was extracted from specimens using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) partial 3\u2019-terminal sequence of hexon gene was amplified by nested-PCR assay as previously described20,21. the amplified DNA was used as a template for Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing (paired-PCR) complete genome of HAdV was assembled by SOAPdenovo23, SeqMan software. phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the Neighbor-Joining method. bootstrap values greater than 70% were considered statistically significant for grouping. 993 nasopharyngeal aspirates or induced sputum were collected from hospitalized children with SARI in Beijing (n = 259), Shanghai (n = 441) and Zhejiang Province (n = 293) following the world health organization protocol19, all the respiratory samples were collected by medical professionals. written informed consent was obtained on their behalf from parents or guardian. phylogenetic and recombinant analyses were performed using the Neighbor-Joining method. the sequence of CBJ113 strain was used as the query sequence. single nucleotide difference analysis was used to confirm the possible recombinant events. phylogenetic evidence for intratypic recombinant events in a novel human adenovirus C causes severe acute respiratory infection."}
