{"summary": "study takes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical site infections (SSIs) as an example to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs. SSIs associated with CABG surgery were identified using ICD-9 CM codes and a Classification and Regression Trees model. volume-outcome studies have gradually changed from mortality to other complications, such as surgical site infections (SSIs) in the past decade, the outcome measures used in volume-outcome studies have gradually changed from mortality to other complications. in the past, some studies calculated the service/ operation volumes within the study period, while others calculated the service/ operation volumes before the study period. the latter definition might better reflect the provider\u2019s level of experience at the time a patient received healthcare services than former one. data sources We used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2005 and 2008. the database covers the 23 million Taiwanese enrollees (approximately 98% of the population) in the NHI program. ICD-9-CM code: 038.0\u2013038.4, 038.8, 038.9, 682.6, 682.9, 780.6, 790.7, 875.0, 875.1, 891.0, 891.1, 996.03, 996.61, 996.72, 998.3, and 998.5. if a case had an index hospitalization event, then he/she will be identified as SSIs by the ICD-9-CM based model. the classification and regression tree (CART) model is the most popular approach as applied in our work. we adopted seven parameters: type of antibiotic, doses of antibiotic, doses of cefazolin, use of second-line antibiotics, length of stay, and number of vessels obstructed. current study analyzed 7,007 patients from 19 medical centers in Taiwan who underwent CABG surgery between 2006 and 2008. a total of 302 cases were identified as SSIs by ICD-9-CM based model, and 107 cases were identified as SSIs by CART model. this study categorized surgeon and hospital volumes into low, medium, and high volume groups by quartile method and k-means clustering algorithm. in terms of surgeon volumes, the first quartile was 4.38, and the third quartile (>75%) was 6.43. the cut-off values of hospital volumes were 5.21 and 5.69, and for surgeon\u2019s volumes were 2.40 and 4.38 respectively. the results of k-means clustering are demonstrated in Figs 1\u20134. multivariate analysis was conducted by fitting mixed-effects logistic regression models to each patient\u2019s data for estimating the effects of three-level predictors on the probability of post-operational SSI. subgroup analysis for comorbidities was also conducted. the ICD-9-CM SSI codes were the most popular tool to identify SSI cases in claims data. SSI cases were divided into two categories: index hospitalization events and post-discharge events. the primary and secondary diagnosis codes for post-discharge events were the criteria for SSI identification. the classification algorithms, the multivariable regression model, and the data mining model were adopted to develop alternative models based on surrogate indicators. if a case satisfies (or exceeds) a specific number of criteria, then it will be identified as a case of infection. current study analyzed 7,007 patients from 19 medical centers in Taiwan who underwent CABG surgery between 2006 and 2008. a total of 302 cases were identified as SSIs by ICD-9-CM based model. study categorized surgeon and hospital volumes into low, medium, and high volume groups by quartile method and k-means clustering algorithm. first quartile (25%) for hospital volumes was 4.66, and third quartile (>75%) was 5.31. the main idea of this method is to partition observed data points into k non-overlapping clusters by minimizing the within-group sum of squares. each point is assigned to the mean of its cluster using the Euclidian distance. previous studies usually divided surgeons and hospitals into low-, medium-, and high-volume groups. patients with CABG performed by 199 surgeons in 19 hospitals during 2006\u20132008 in Taiwan. the majority of patients were male (77.5%), and the mean age of patients was 65.3 years. most cases received surgery by male surgeons, with a mean age of 45.0 years. surgeon's average operation volumes within the study period was 151.64. average operation volumes before each surgery was 52.18. most patients received surgeries by high-volume surgeons and hospitals. the results of multilevel mixed-effect models show that the surgeon\u2019s volumes were negatively associated with SSIs. the results of Model 1 (continuous) reveal that the surgeon\u2019s volumes were negatively associated with SSIs, while hospital\u2019s volumes were not associated with surgical site infection SSIs. 0.958 0.0086 Cumulative volumes (Reference: high-volume) Low-volume 2.220 1.133 4.350 0.0224 1.709 0.911 3.203 0.0922 Medium-volume 1.881 0.919 3.848 0.0806 1.385 0.936 2.048 0.1003 OR: odds ratio; C.I.: confidence interval; LCL: upper confidence limit. models were adjusted by hospital ownership and geographic location, surgeon\u2019s gender and age, patient\u2019s age, gender, length of ICU stay, number of vessels obstructed and underlying diseases. results also revealed low-volume surgeons had higher risk (OR = 1.642,p =0.040) than high-volume surgeons. models were adjusted by hospital ownership and geographic location, surgeon\u2019s gender and age, patient\u2019s age, gender, length of ICU stay, number of vessels obstructed and underlying diseases. in Model 1, the results showed that the relationship between hospital\u2019s/ surgeon\u2019s volumes and SSIs did not exist.

Wu et al. adopted the cumulative operation volumes within the study period as the definition, and identified SSIs by ICD-9-CM codes. the results varied between different definitions and categorization method of operation volumes. analysis was applied to manage the nested factors, and two definitions of operation volume along with three different operation volume categorization methods were adopted to examine the relationship between volume and SSIs. however, the study suffered from several major limitations. the accuracy of SSIs identification was still an issue."}
