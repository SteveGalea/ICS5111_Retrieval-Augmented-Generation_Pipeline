{"summary": "mink enteritis virus, canine distemper virus, canine distemper virus, mink orthoreovirus, and mink coronavirus. to identify the causative agent, we homogenized fecal, liver, and gut samples from diseased mink in phosphate-buffered saline. this study CV-F4 GCAGTAAGTCTCCCCCTTTACTGCAATATC Designed for this study All samples from mink with diarrhea were positive by PCR for the same circovirus-like Rep sequence. all samples from healthy mink were negative, showing a strong relationship between the identified virus and disease. the complete circular genome of MiCV-DL13 contained 1,753 nt. highest similarity was 64.1% with the genome of BtCV-XOR. the deduced capsid protein is 227 aa; highest similarity is 47.3% with porcine circovirus 2. scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. strain sequenced from the mink in dalian, china, during 2013. novel circovirus, MiCV, was identified in liver and digestive tract samples from mink with diarrhea. no DNA was found in any healthy mink, indicating a strong relationship between the isolated virus and disease."}
