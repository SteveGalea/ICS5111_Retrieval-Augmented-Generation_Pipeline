{"summary": "the clinical symptoms of PDCoV are similar to those of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) but mortality rates are lower in PDCoV-affected nursing pigs. PDCoV was first identified in pigs in 2012, while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in the united states in 2014. PDCoV is a newly emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus. it is unclear whether PDCoV has HA activity. our results will provide important information for the investigation of PDCoV biological characteristics. whole blood samples were collected in a centrifuge tube containing an anticoagulant agent (heparin sodium) then immediately washed five times with PBS (pH 7.2) and centrifugation at 1,000 r/min for 30 min. erythrocytes were then resuspended in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C for use in experiments. trypsin-treated PDCoVs were purified by layering onto a sucrose gradient (wt/wt) and centrifuged for 4 h at 150,000 g. rabbit erythrocytes were incubated separately with trypsin (100 g/mL) or neuraminidase (5 U/mL) for 30 min. cell culture supernatants were taken at 6, 12, 24, and 36 h post-inoculation (hpi) titrated by TCID50 and HA tests. monolayers at 90% to 100% confluence were washed twice with PBS. erythrocyte preparation Erythrocytes were obtained from rabbit, pig, chicken, mouse, guinea pig, and human. whole blood samples were collected in a centrifuge tube containing an anticoagulant agent (heparin sodium), then immediately washed five times with PBS (pH 7.2) the erythrocytes were then resuspended in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C for use in experiments. PDCoV strains were treated separately with different concentrations of trypsin (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 g/mL) or neuraminidase (50 and 100 mU/mL) (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. trypsin was then inactivated with 2 g/mL aprotinin (Sigma) LLC-PK cell monolayers were seeded into 96-well plates. monolayers at 90% to 100% confluence were washed twice with PBS. TCID50 was calculated by applying the Reed and Muench method. PDCoV strains HNZK-04 and CH-01 were pre-treated with trypsin or neuraminidase. neither PDCoV strains showed HA activity against erythrocytes from pig, chicken, mouse, guinea pig, or human. neuraminidase-treated strains agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. erythrocytes were pre-treated separately with trypsin or neuraminidase. the HA test was then used to assess agglutination. the results showed that the PDCoV-positive sera inhibited the hemagglutination activity of PDCoV. titer declined to 7.8 lg TCID50/0.1 mL at 36 hpi. TCID50, tissue culture infectious dose 50; HA, hemagglutination; PDCoV, porcine deltacoronavirus. neuraminidase-treated PDCoV strains exhibited HA activity against erythrocytes from pig, chicken, mouse, guinea pig, or human. similar results were observed for the neuraminidase-treated PDCoV strains. rabbit erythrocytes were not agglutinated, which indicates trypsin or neuraminidase can prevent the agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes. the results showed that the PDCoV-positive sera inhibited the hemagglutination activity of PDCoV, and the HI titers of PDCoV-positive sera were range from 5 log2 to 8 log2. culture supernatant was sampled at 6, 12, 24, and 36 hpi. PDCoV has caused great economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. PDCoV has been detected in many countries. PDCoV showed no HA activity against erythrocytes from pig, chicken, mouse, guinea pig, or different types of human erythrocytes. however, it could agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes when PDCoV was pre-treated with trypsin or neuraminidase. the growth curve of PDCoV was correlated with the observed HA titers. this result indicates that the HA activity of PDCoV is associated with virus production."}
