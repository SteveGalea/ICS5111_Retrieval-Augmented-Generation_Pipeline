{"summary": "infection by the virus is a current global pandemic and liver disease is the main reason for liver transplantations in western countries. replication is believed to occur in specialized compartments within virus-infected cells, termed membranous webs [1,6,9] previous modeling work at an (intra)cellular level using HCV has focused on ordinary differential equation compartment models, cf., [22,23,24,25,26]. to our best knowledge, spatial resolution is an aspect that has only been rarely appreciated in biophysical modeling approaches of virus dynamics to date. we present a quantitative, spatially resolved analysis of the NS5A movement dynamics. for this purpose, we combine and compare experimental fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) [32,33] time series (TMS) data [34] with mathematical simulations of a model probing a diffusion process of the NS5A protein on realistic reconstructed ER surfaces [5]. our approach may be used as first step of computational-based quantitative research in virology using advanced spatio-temporal resolved modeling and simulations techniques. FRAP time series data [34] recorded the intracellular dynamics of NS5A movement [10] at perinuclear zones. these data report the dynamics of NS5A under a variety of biological conditions. FRAP experiments rely on the bleaching and refilling of a region within a cell corresponding to the intracellular location of a fluorescing component of interest, in this case, NS5A. a strong laser beam deletes the fluorescence in a defined region; the cylindrical FRAP region of interest (ROI) F. NS5A/Alone cells allow the investigation of transport processes for less restricted NS5A-GFP. in contrast, NS5A/OtherNSPs cells have NS5A-GFP expressed as part of NS3-5B where NS5A diffusion is more restricted to replication sites. the peripheral NS5A foci are frequently highly motile and capable of rapid long-range traffic. this \u201cjumping\u201d movement characteristics of NS5A clusters does not appear at perinuclear regions. FRAP analyses of intense perinuclear NS5A foci have revealed a relatively static internal architecture. our aim is to model FRAP experiments of the NS5A protein. Diffusive movement of NS5A is restricted to the ER surface. a portion of NS5A clusters to DMV complexes, which likely originate from the ER surface. first order transformation model for mass transfer between both ( ) -species. transport of the ( ) -type is much faster than of the ( + ) -type. characteristic time of reactions is much faster than the characteristic time for (diffusive) transport, i.e., k on 1, k off 1 2 D 2 D +. d t i ns 5 a : = D / 1 + k on k off (7) yields the central sPDE for the dynamics of NS5A fluorescence expressed in terms of the intensity density. this equation includes the intensity reduction caused by the intensity measurement with the soft laser as a \u201cpseudo reaction\u201d by a constant r p. this effect is discussed in greater detail in the forthcoming Section 2.5. 5 a A, D ns 5 a N and measurement induced intensity reduction rates r p A, r p N for both cell types. the additional indices for the cell lines will be suppressed if the forthcoming statements are valid for both cell types. initial conditions for (8) are provided independently for bleached and unbleached zones. the sPDE (8) computations were performed with UG4 [49,50,51] based on Finite Volumes discretisations [52,53,54] and massively parallel multigrid solvers [55,56]. the application of the soft laser induces an intensity decay, which is reflected by the constant r p in (8). the stochastic distributions and averages were computed with standard algorithms [65] using R [66] using R [66]. Figure 1. Intensity changes in unbleached control region C according to Equation (10): Experimental data for time series (TMS) #2 (NS5A/OtherNSPs) and the appropriate fit. 20 NS5A FRAP time series from a former study [34] are the experimental basis of this study. these 20 time series reflect the NS5A dynamics. each time series corresponds with one special cell geometry. each time series corresponds to one cell structure. reconstructed 5 realistic ER surfaces using NeuRA2.3 [67,68] based on (with Huygens [69] deblured z-stacks from another former study [5]. for each ER geometry, we were probing for 2 different exemplary FRAP ROIs with a size of 38 ( m ) 2 as in the FRAP experiments [34]. i ns 5 a ( t, x ) d x F d x (12) is computed as solution of the sPDE (8) for each one of the 200 combinations of time series. combined 10 reconstructed geometric setups with 20 experimental time series, yields a total of 200 combinations. NS5A/Alone and NS5A/OtherNSPs were divided into two groups. NS5A/Alone cells contain a DNA construct that encodes a NS5A-GFP fusion protein, but no other virus proteins are present. NS5A/OtherNSPs cells constitutively replicate HCV RNA but do not produce virus structural proteins (SPs) a proportion of NS5A can subsequently cluster to form vesicles, such as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) this applies equally to the NS5A/Alone data where only NS5A is expressed alone, and also for the NS5A that is expressed together with other NSPs. FRAP experiments of NS5A [34] were performed at perinuclear regions. we did not take into account the highly motile subpopulations of DMVs at peripheral subcellular locations during our modeling. this study focuses on NS5A properties within perinuclear regions of the cell. c ( ) and c ( + ) denote the surface concentrations of NS5A occurring freely () and in clustered form (+) (i.e., not clustering to DMVs or web regions) respectively. this definition tacitly assumes that it is reasonable to average over a certain area, which is large compared to the representative size of a cluster of molecules for either of the two types. we replace (1) by the quasi-steady-state equilibrium k on c ( ) = k off c ( + ), (4) and obtain a reduced version for (2): 1 + k on k off d d t c ( ) D ( T ) c ( ) = 0. this can formally deduce by summing up (1) and (2). this equation includes the intensity reduction caused by the intensity measurement with the soft laser as a pseudo reaction by a constant r p. this effect is discussed in greater detail in the forthcoming section 2.5. the intensity of the FRAP region is much smaller than of the surrounding unbleached region, i 0 F i 0 U. the initial values of the simulations, i 0 F and i 0 U, are determined by experimental values according to i 0 F = I 0 F / I 0 and i 0 U = I 0 C / I 0. After bleaching, the intensities I F ( t 0 ) and I U ( t d d t i c ( t ) = r p i c ( t ) i c ( t ) = i 0 exp ( t t t 0 ) i c ( t ) = i 0 exp ( t t t 0 ). the final averaged values r p, r p N enter the diffusion equation of NS5A on the ER surface for the corresponding TMS of the two cell lines. the data shows that the values for r p are not correlated and can be distinguished. the reduction rate for NS5A/OtherNSPs cells is higher than for NS5A/Alone. in vitro cell can be used either for FRAP experiments, or for staining. staining is the basis for reconstructions. a cell used to perform a FRAP time series cannot be stained. the basic geometry details (like vertex numbers of the unstructured triangular grids\u2014about 10 6 at base level), discretization and solver properties were presented in our former paper [35]. averaging procedures and distribution computations were performed with standard algorithms [65] implemented within the program code R [66] results 3.1. realistic simulation of FRAP Experiments. the curves depict the uprise of the concentration within the (bleached) FRAP ROI F for the in vitro and the in silico case. the case r p A = 0 neglects the measurement process induced signal reduction within (8). the other case incorporates the afore estimated non-zero value of r p A. the single simulations were performed as explained before in Section 3.1. the simulation intensity of the FRAP region (12) of these single in silico processes was then fitted to the experimental time series. the final diffusion constant was calculated as the average of the estimated diffusion constants of all combinations time series\u2014geometric setups. points and error bars correspond for (a,b) to estimated values for D ns 5 a (shown on x axis) for the combination of single TMS with single geometries. each \u201crow\u201d corresponds to one time series combined with all ER geometries. each \u201crow\u201d corresponds to one ER geometry combined with all TMS. results averaged over the geometric setups and the time series for the respective two cell types concerning the refinement level were intensively tested. only the NS5A/Alone cell case allowed for the derivation of reliable results for r p = 0. for the detailed results, we refer to appendix D. simulation of FRAP experiment on simple 2D planar continuum geometry. at the beginning, the bleached region has low concentration, but the 2D diffusion refills it again during the process. from the high concentration unbleached region around, fluorescating NS5A is diffusing inside. the ER structure is neglected. lone cells were approximately 4-fold larger than that of the NS5A/OtherNSPs cells. the estimated value for the NS5A/OtherNSPs is significantly smaller than that of NS5A/Alone cells. the parameter estimations based on simplified 2D planar geometry caused a decrease of the diffusion constant values by a factor of approximately 2. the curves depict the uprise of the concentration within the (bleached) FRAP ROI F. the curves depict the uprise of the concentration within the (bleached) FRAP ROI F. in silico curves are curves which arise for the estimated optimal value of D ns 5 a N for the time series # 5 of the NS5A/OtherNSPs cell case adapted to the reconstructed ER geometry E 1. 3.2. estimation of the NS5A diffusion constant on the ER surface for the experimental time series of both NS5A/Alone and NS5A/OtherNSPs cells. the use of other realistic geometric setups from independent ER staining data seems to be justified.

Thin points and the total averages are identical for (a,b) and are reported in Table 1. 3.4. Refinement Stability The numerical stability of the results averaged over the geometric setups. only the NS5A/Alone cell case allowed for the derivation of reliable results for r p = 0. For the detailed results, we refer to Appendix D. Figure 8 depicts a screenshot of a simulation at the 2D plane geometry. we show the distribution of the estimated diffusion constant corresponding to the single time series and the averaged results of both cell types. the final averaged results are computed by means of the averaging process of the single results.
