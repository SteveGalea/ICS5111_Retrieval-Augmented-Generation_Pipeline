{"summary": "macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of 38.0\u00b0C at 72 hours after macrolide treatment. the cases were divided into four groups: PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX. macrolides have long been the first-line treatment for MP pneumonia in children. incidence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) has recently increased worldwide. some studies have reported the clinical effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids (CST) in the treatment of refractory MP pneumonia. hyper-reaction of the host immune system may contribute to its pathogenesis. however, CST can also cause several side effects, such as growth disorder, glucose intolerance and the suppression of the immune system. patients with a history of MP infection within the past year. 3) patients with a history of MP infection within the past year. 4) patients prescribed oseltamivir because of proven influenza during hospitalization period. a nasopharyngeal swab was included. we compared the TTD after secondary treatment. the length of hospital stay between PMC group vs. each CST, DXC. this algorithm attempted to match the PMC subjects and the secondary treatment subjects on the first 8 digits of the PS. the patients that did not match were then matched to secondary treatment subjects on 7 digits of the PS. patients with a history of MP infection within the past year. patients with a history of MP infection within the past year. patients with a history of MP infection within the past year. we compared the TTD after secondary treatment, combined antibiotics, other required treatments and outcomes among the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. compared the length of hospital stay between PMC group vs. each CST, DXC, and LFX group. X = 2:1 was based on a greedy 8-1 digits matching algorithm. the patients that did not match were then matched to secondary treatment subjects on 7 digits of the PS. the patients with no corresponding match were excluded. the number of boys in each group was 59 (42.8%), 19 (59.4%), 4 (28.6%), and 3 (50.0%). median duration of hospitalization was 9.5 days (range: 5.0\u201322.0), 9.5 days (range: 6.0\u201317.0), 9.0 days (range: 4.0\u201316.0), and 9.5 days (range: 8.0\u201323.0), respectively (P = 0.726) 0.726 Chest radiograph findings Consolidationa 44 (31.9) 15 (46.9) 9 (64.3) 5 (83.3) 0.005 Lobar consolidation 12 (8.7) 2 (6.3) 0 (0.0) 1 (6.7) 0.534 Patchy consolidationb 32 (23.2) 13 (40.6) 9 (64.3) 4 (66.7) 0.001 Reticular opacities 10 (7.2) 1 (3.1) 0 (0.0) 1 (16.7) 0.400 Pneumonic infiltration 85 (61.6 PMC (n = 138) CST (n = 32) DXC (n = 14) LFX (n = 6) P value Febrile days before macrolide treatment Mean SD 4.0 2.1 3.9 2.0 2.9 2.4 3.2 1.8 Median (range) 4.0 (0.0\u201311.0) 4.0 (0.0\u20137.0) 4.0 (0.0\u20135.0) 0.326 Febrile days during macrolide single treatment Mean SD - 5.0 2.6 4.8 1.8 6.7 5.6 the TTD was the shortest in the CST group (8.4 26.8 hours), followed by the LFX (16.8 18.0 hours) and DXC (27.4 33.2 hours) groups. the numbers of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 31 (96.9%), 12 (85.7%), and 5 (83.3%), respectively. there was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the PMC group and each secondary treatment group. there was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the PMC group and each secondary treatment group.
