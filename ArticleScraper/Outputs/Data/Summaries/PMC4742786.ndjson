{"summary": "transient expression of target proteins can be achieved by plant viruses or by agroinfiltration. antigen preparation plays a crucial role in the development of a diagnostic test. plants represent an ideal biofactory system, especially when it is necessary to produce \u2018rapid response\u2019 vaccines. u et al., 2015), MERS (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2015; Keener, 2015) and other viruses where the principles of the so-called \u201cone health initiative\u201d are important. the fact that the epidemiology of these diseases is associated to sudden and sometimes unforeseen contagious burst, results in an on/off attention about, in terms of research, prevention and pharma industry efforts. the large SARS-CoV genome encodes four viral structural components, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and 16 non-structural proteins. the structural N protein is the most abundant protein in the SARS-CoV virion. the M protein is the most abundant protein in the SARS-CoV viral envelope. it is functionally involved in the assembly and budding of virions from the cell. it consists of 221 amino acids (25 kDa) and a short glycosylated N-terminal domain. in this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using plant transient expression systems to produce two SARS-CoV antigens, the N and M proteins, as useful tools to face SARS-CoV infection. we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV N protein produced in Nicotiana benthamiana is recognized by the specific antibodies of convalescent SARS patients. full-length genes of the human SARS-CoV Frankfurt I isolate were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA Cloning vector. the inserted fragments were cut out by digestion with BamHI-NotI and sub-cloned into the pQE-30 (Qiagen) prokaryotic expression vector (pQE-30-N and pQE-30-M) for mammalian cells expression, the PCR product was cut out by digestion viral cDNA of the potato virus X (PVX) is inserted between the constitutive 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35S) and the transcription terminator (Nos-term) of the nopaline synthase gene of A. tumefaciens, necessary for the regulation of the viral genome expression upon infection with plasmid DNA. rabbit anti-N pAb cloned full-length M gene (666-bp long) from pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector. forward primer 5\u2032-GGCCATCGATGAATTCGGATCCATCATGGCAGACAACGG TACTATTAC-3\u2032 (ClaI restriction site: underlined, EcoRI site: underlined, underlined, notI site: italic, stop translation codon: bold) were used to add restriction sites useful for pPVX-N and pPVX-M plasmids were purified with endotoxin-free purification kits. pVAX-N and pVAX-M plasmids were purified with endotoxin-free purification kits. pBI-121 plant binary vector obtained the pBI-M construct. comparison of M protein expression in plant by PVX-mediated infection or by agroinfiltration and solubility. lanes 4, 5: soluble and insoluble fractions, respectively, from leaves infiltrated with A. tumefaciens. culture growth was performed at suboptimal temperature of 30\u00b0C. characterization revealed that it corresponded to a spontaneously mutated M gene. the MRLV and the N proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in denaturing conditions.

N protein expression was confirmed at least until the third cycle of re-infection. the amount of recombinant N protein expressed in leaves was approximately 3\u20134 g/g fresh leaf weight. we performed a small-scale purification by loading plant extracts derived from freeze-dried leaves on a Ni-NTA affinity purification column. in this way, we obtained yields of about 1 g of purified N protein/g of fresh leaf weight. to further characterize the N protein expressed in plant, we analyzed its reactivity with sera from SARS patients. these SARS sera were previously screened by an ELISA assay with an E. coli-expressed N protein (Di Bonito and Chan, data not shown) here, to evaluate SARS-positive sera reactivity with N plant expressed protein, we used a \u2018multi-strip\u2019 western blot assay. each strip contains approximately 250 ng of N protein. Strip 1 was probed with the mouse anti-N pAb (positive control). Strips 6\u20138: probed with pools of sera deriving from patients affected by non-SARS respiratory diseases (negative control). the time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi (data not shown) the time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi. for immunoblotting analysis, the M protein was extracted with an appropriate buffer (GB buffer) ane domain and V160 > I in the cytoplasmic domain (MRLV) as the plant-derived recombinant M protein, the MRLV was also specifically recognized by the mouse anti-M pAb (Figure 6C) the MRLV protein was useful as standard for the plant-produced M protein characterization. benthamiana plants were either mock infected or infected with the wild type pPVX201 vector. the infection spread systemically to apical leaves, where symptoms appeared 7\u201310 dpi. s from plants infected with pPVX-N reveals a single band of about 50 kDa in systemic leaves. pPVX-N-derived extracts stored at \u2013 20 \u00b0C for 2 months and then thawed showed an intact N protein. immunofluorescence revealed a cytoplasmic localization of the N protein. hek-293 cells were transfected with the pVAX-N plasmid (N) or with the pVAX empty vector. nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (100x objective, ZEISS ACHROSTIGMAT 100x/1,25 oil) plant extracts deriving from PVX-N-infected leaves were also used for subsequent inoculations. the best recovery of the N protein from E. coli was obtained in denaturing conditions (3 mg of protein/liter of culture under denaturing conditions versus 0.4 mg protein/liter of culture under native conditions. we performed a small-scale purification by loading plant extracts derived from freeze-dried leaves. ELISA and immunoblot analysis gave a first indication of antigenic features of the plant-derived N protein. in such analysis the N protein was specifically recognized by rabbit and mouse anti-His6-N hyper-immune sera that had previously been shown to recognize the N protein in SARS-CoV infected cells. these SARS sera were previously screened by an ELISA assay with an E. coli-expressed N protein (Di Bonito and Chan, data not shown) coli (500 ng); strips 2, 4: purified N protein produced in plant (250 ng) each strip derives from the blotting of a single-well SDS-PAGE gel. each strip contains approximately 250 ng of N protein. strip 1 was probed with the mouse anti-N pAb (positive control) the time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi (data not shown) the time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi (data not shown) the time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi (data not shown) DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence in the M gene of three spontaneous point mutations: R13 > K in the N-terminal domain, L36 > F in the first transmembrane domain and V160 > I in the cytoplasmic domain (MRLV). as the plant-derived recombinant M protein, the MRLV was specifically recognized by the mouse anti-M pAb that had previously validated by IFA in SARS CoV infected Vero cells. et al., 2010) described a perinuclear and plasma membrane localization of the M protein expressed in various cell lines. however, we did not observe M protein expression by immunoblotting, either in transfected cells or in the culture medium. the importance to develop effective therapeutic and preventive strategies is established by the two novel coronaviruses that have emerged in humans in the twenty-first century. the four major diagnostic methods available for SARS include viral RNA detection by RT-PCR, virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), or by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (N) and inoculation of patient specimens in cell culture. the SARS-CoV protein, expressed at early stage of infection and triggering a strong antibody response by the host, is considered to be the best diagnostic target. an interesting study correlated the phosphorylation state of the N protein with its antigenicity and specificity of antibodies recognition (Shin et al., 2007). the N protein produced in insect cells may be useful for the development of highly sensitive and specific assays to determine SARS infection (Shin et al., 2007). plant transformation and regeneration of stable transformants require considerable time. we used transient expression systems (PVX and agroinfiltration) to evaluate the ability of the plant expression system to cope with the synthesis of the SARS-CoV M and N proteins. derived extracts show the stability of the recombinant N protein when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana. the same stability was observed when the N protein was expressed in mammalian cells, even in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. the purified plant-produced N protein is specifically recognized by Chinese SARS patients of the 2003 outbreak. compared to the mutated MRLV protein produced in E. coli, the M protein produced in plant shows a reduced electrophoretic mobility, suggesting a higher molecular mass. the plant-produced M protein yields were not sufficient to perform the test with human sera. conclusion Our results add further insights to the characterization of the N and M proteins and provide a proof of principle for using plants as a robust, rapid and flexible production system. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
