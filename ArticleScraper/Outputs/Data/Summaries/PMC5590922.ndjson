{"summary": "HKHA has built a world-class public healthcare infrastructure that handles around 90% of secondary and tertiary medical needs in HK. HA policy makers must evaluate the healthcare efficiency of hospitals, locate bottlenecks within public healthcare service system, and establish countermeasures accordingly. a high patient mortality rate reflects a poor medical quality, but also may cause a dispute. the mortality rate of patient, as an undesirable output, is expected to be lower. in [25], a slacks-based measure (SBM) is proposed, in which the unit invariant, monotone, and reference-set dependent properties are analyzed in details. a more generalized slacks-based DEA model with undesirable factors considering preference is proposed. the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art DEA models on different databases of real applications. DEA models evaluate the relative efficiency of DMUs by creating a production frontier using the best practice of observed data. a DMU is to be rated as fully efficient on the basis of available evidence if and only if the performances of other DMUs does not show that some of its inputs or outputs can be improved without worsening some of its other outputs. x j D = ( x 1 j D,..., x m j D ), x j I = ( x 1 j I,..., x q j I ), y j G = ( y 1 j G,..., y s j G ) and y j B = ( y 1 j B,..., y k j B ) be observed input and output vectors. a DMU0 is efficient if there is no vector ( x 0 D, y 0 G, x 0 I, y 0 B ). for a DMU 0 = ( x 0 D, y 0 G, x 0 I, y 0 B ) the inequalities in Eq (1) can be transformed into equalities. R + q, and s B - = (s 1 B -, s 2 B -,..., s k B -) are defined as desirable input (DI) excess, desirable output (DO) shortfall, undesirable input (UI) shortfall, and undesirable output (UO) excess. the GSBUP model is developed by applying the transformation approach mentioned above: [GSBUP] min 0 = i = 1 m i i + h = 1 k h h l = 1 q l l + r = 1 s r s. t. j = 1 n x l j I j = l x l 0 I ( l = 1, 2,..., q ) j = 1 i, r, l, and h (i, r, l, h) denote the preferences of DI, DO, UI, and UO respectively. i = 1 m i + h = 1 k h = 1 and l = 1 q l + r = 1 s r = 1. projection of GSBUP DMU 0 = ( x 0 D, y 0 G, x 0 I, y 0 B) by x 0 D = j j * x j D = * x 0 D x 0 I = j j * x j I = * x 0 I y 0 G = j j * y j G = * y 0 G y 0 B = the calculation of Malmquist index requires two single period and two mixed period evaluations according to GSBUP-DEA Model (4). the frontier at time t + 1, i.e., calculating 0 t + 1 ( x 0 D, t, y 0 G, t, x 0 I, t, y 0 B, t + 1. t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 G, t + 1, y 0 B, t + 1. t + 1, y 0 I, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 B, t + 1. TEC0 > 1, TEC0 = 1 indicates that technical efficiency declines, remains unchanged and improves, respectively. TEC0 = 1 indicates that technical efficiency declines, remains unchanged. GSBUP-DEA GSBUP (Generalized Slacks-Based DEA model with Undesirable factors considering Preference) [26] is a non-oriented DEA model, in which undesirable inputs are regarded as the desirable outputs and vice versa, according to the physical relationship between them. vectors have non-negative values and each DMU has at least one strictly positive input and output. a DMU0 is efficient if there is no vector ( x 0 D, y 0 G, x 0 I, y 0 B ). j j x j D = x 0 D - s D - j x j I = x 0 I + s I + j j y j G = y 0 G + s G + j j y j B = y 0 B - s B - (2) where s D - = ( s 1 D -, s 2 D -,..., s m D j x j I = ( 1 + \u2032 ) x 0 G j j y j G = ( 1 + \u2032 ) y 0 B (3) where \u201c\u201d denotes the element-wise multiplication between vectors, = 1 - \u2032 = ( 1, 2,..., m ) R + m, = 1 + \u2032 = ( 1, 2,..., s ) R + s, = 1 + \u2032 = ( 1, 2,..., q j = 1 n y r j G j = r y r 0 G ( r = 1, 2,..., q ) j = 1 n y r j G j = r y r 0 G ( r = 1, 2,..., q ) j = 1 n y h j B j = h y h 0 B ( h = 1, 2,..., k ) j GSBUP can improve the performance of inefficient DMUs by either increasing the current DO (or UI) levels or decreasing the current DI (or UO) levels. a DMU 0 = ( x 0 D, y 0 G, x 0 I, y 0 B ) is called GSBUP-efficient if and only when the optimal solution (*, *, *, *) = (1, 1, 1, 1) holds. GSBUP-based malmquist productivity index DEA-based malmquist productivity index provides an evaluation of productivity change over time. from time t to t + 1, DMU0\u2019s technical efficiency and empirical production frontier may change. 0 t + 1 ( x 0 D, t + 1, y 0 G, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 B, t + 1 ) to the frontier at time t + 1, i.e., calculating 0 t + 1 ( x 0 D, t, y 0 G, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 B, t + 1 0 t + 1 ( x 0 D, t + 1, y 0 G, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 B, t + 1 ) 0 t + 1 ( x 0 D, t + 1, y 0 G, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, x 0 I, t + 1, y 0 B, TEC0 > 1, TEC0 = 1 indicates regress in the frontier technology. TEC0 = 1 indicates no shift in the frontier technology. HKHA divides public hospitals into seven hospital clusters. Table 1 lists the specific hospitals in each cluster, which are also the DMUs evaluated in this study. two DIs (i.e., the number of full-time equivalent staff and the number of beds), one UI (i.e., in-patient discharge rate), and one UO (i.e., crude mortality rate) are selected for each DMU. there is a continuous increase in investment in both human resources and bed among hospitals. except for the DIs, all other factors (e.g., utilization of bed, total patient attendances, and mortality rate) reach the peak values in 2003, especially the mortality rate, which is due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Ruttonjee Hospital & Tang Shiu Kin Hospital, Caritas Medical Centre and Yan Chai Hospital are designated to provide the Geriatric Day Hospital. the heavy load on outpatient service may compete against the inpatient treatment, leading to a serious outcome of patient mortality. the data in 2013 shows that the median value of each factor is significantly different from the average value. the standard deviation values are large and the maximum can be 200 times larger than the minimum, indicating that resource utilization levels and resource allocation of the clusters are seriously unbalanced. the efficiency scores for all the hospitals during 2000-2013 are listed in Table 7. the efficient DMUs\u2019 0 * are equal to 1. the efficiency scores for all the hospitals during 2000-2013 are listed in Table 7. 97 0.760 IRS Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin 0.847 0.769 0.786 0.807 0.771 IRS St. John 0.963 0.974 0.864 0.920 0.894 IRS Tung Wah Eastern 0.931 0.885 0.893 0.942 0.931 IRS queen Mary 0.816 0.784 0.822 0.787 0.677 DRS Tseung Kwan O 0.843 0.727 1 1 1 1 1 CRS(IRS) United a decreasing return to scale (DRS) occurs when the proportion of output is less than the desired increased input during the production process. if HKHA policy makers can increase the hospital scale for the inefficient hospitals with IRS (i.e., Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and Pok Oi Hospital) these hospitals will achieve a higher service level than they expected. table 9 displays the slacks of each cluster measured by GSBUP. it is observed that the sD of HKEC and HKWC with IRS is almost equal to zero; while their sG+ are not null. this means that the inefficient clusters with IRS are mainly caused by the inefficient resource utilization. the first diagnosed patient with SARS was on 21 February 2003. from 2000 to 2013, all the productivities of hospitals have made significant improvement. the peak of the epidemic started from 24 March 2003. the designation of Princess Margret Hospital officially ended on 11 April 2003. a revised public hospital fees structure was implemented at the beginning of 2003. there is improvement in TEC for almost all the hospitals.

Tseung Kwan O Hospital (2007-2013), Caritas Medical Centre (2000), Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (2000 and 2010) and Tuen Mun Hospital (2013) are the efficient hospitals in resource operation. only 55% hospitals have higher efficiency values than the average, 0.870, which reveals unfair resource allocation, inefficient resource utilization and poor management in HKHA. in DEA, an increasing return to scale occurs when the output increases by a larger proportion than the inputs. Conversely, a decreasing return to scale occurs when the proportion of output is less than the desired increased input during the production process. if HKHA policy makers can properly increase the input of medical resources for the inefficient hospitals with IRS, these hospitals will achieve a higher service level than they expected. the sD of HKEC and HKWC with IRS is almost equal to zero; while their sG+ are not null. the inefficient clusters with IRS are mainly caused by the inefficient resource utilization. the updated clusters\u2019 efficiency scores based on GSBUP-LP model can be calculated. it is observed that all the clusters\u2019 efficiencies are improved significantly, which further demonstrates that it is necessary to change the ideas for the medical investment standard. the TEC and FS improve by 17.87% and 13.76% respectively. the TEC and FS improve by 4.77% and 13.76% respectively.
