{"summary": "novel influenza virus A (H1N1) has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people. the spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic. but data on risk perception and behavioral response is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. human-to-human transmission became widespread in at least one region of the world. the virus appears to have a higher reproduction number and somewhat higher case fatality ratio than recent seasonal influenza viruses [4], [5], and has certainly caused great concern in the population. the feasibility of halting or mitigating the spread of an infectious disease is highest during the very early stages of an outbreak. however, the feasibility of halting or mitigating the spread of an infectious disease is highest during the very early phases of an outbreak. survey was designed to get a rapid assessment of respondents' affective state, sources of information on the emerging pandemic, and behaviors undertaken for protection while minimizing respondent burden. questions probing subjective assessment of risk perception, level of anxiety, and ability to avoid flu infection were asked on a 9 point ordinal scale. a combined day of 28\u201329 April represents survey day 1. subjects were asked to state the number of contacts in the past 24 hours. respondents were provided five ordered categories: less than 5, 5\u201310, 11\u201320, 21\u201350, 51\u2013100. respondents' affective state (subjective anxiety, fatalism about infection) predicts protective measures. we include in the model demographic (age, gender), epidemiological (household size, number of contacts, survey day) and media (source of information on the outbreak) conditioning variables. the sample we fielded in internet-based survey starting on 29 April 2009 using a networked computer. the initial seed for the sample was generated using social networking software. the survey was picked up by a variety of internet media sources including several science general media blogs. anxiety, and ability to avoid flu infection were asked on a 9 point ordinal scale with anchors at the extrema and the center. subjects were asked to state the number of contacts in the past 24 hours. subjects were asked to state the number of contacts in the past 24 hours. the protection index was constructed by summing the answers to the questions. the index ranged from 0\u20139, with larger values indicating more protective measures. the index was a function of covariates. we used likelihood-based model selection [17] to search the model space set up by our conditioning variables. of the nine protective behaviors, increased hand-washing is both the simplest and probably most effective at curbing transmission. of the nine protective behaviors, increased hand-washing is both the simplest and probably most effective at curbing transmission. swine flu had a mean second only to injury, and the highest among the infectious sources of threat. the mean of perceived threat from swine flu fell above the Bonferroni-corrected 95% confidence interval for all other threats but unintentional injury. figure 5 shows the frequency distribution of protective behaviors. nearly 80% of respondents report washing hands more frequently. most common source of information reported was the internet. age increases and male gender decreases the protection index. receiving large amounts of information from the internet, tv, and social networking media has no effect. the number of contacts outside the home does not discernible effect. increased hand-washing showed similar trends to the model for the protection index. male gender decreases while age and survey day increase the odds of increasing hand-washing. perception of risk and subjective anxiety significantly increase the odds of increased hand-washing modestly. 71 0.0254 2.24 0.0249 Info: Internet 0.4089 0.0696 5.87 0.001 Info: Radio 0.5064 0.0962 5.27 0.001 Info: TV 0.2502 0.0905 2.76 0.0057 Info: Health Official 0.4564 0.0897 5.09

while the number of people reporting high values of the protective index declined dramatically. the pattern is significantly different from the expected pattern based on marginal frequencies (2 = 113.1, df = 54, p0.001). to visualize the pattern of departure from the expected values, we calculated an expected tables taken as the cross-product of the marginals of the observed table normalized by the grand sum. we combined rows of these tables to simplify the presentation, plotting the difference between observed and expected tables for a high, medium and low emotional status/protection index respectively. the second PC, which explained 15.6% of the variance, showed strong positive correlations with swine flu (r = 0.516), bird flu (r = 0.530), and terrorism (r = 0.467) all three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty are likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat [22] the first explanation is consistent with work in social epidemiology on the role of social networks in mediating infection risk. many questions about this Novel Swine-Origin influenza A(H1N1) virus remain. it could mutate during the flu season in the southern hemisphere. our results may have implications for CDC strategies for spreading public health information via social media. the advantage of our internet-based sampling strategy is the ability to quickly deploy a survey and thereby track responses in near real-time. the clear disadvantage of this strategy is a sacrifice of population representativeness. our data set is unique and scientifically important for the study of the spread of information and distribution of risk perception and behavioral change."}
