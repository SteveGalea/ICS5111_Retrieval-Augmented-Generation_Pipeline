{"summary": "in 2012, the WHO declared ambitious targets to reduce the burden of these diseases by eliminating them as a public health problem by 2020 [1]. there are active discussions on how to exploit the likely synergies between the goals for NTDs and universal health coverage (SDG; target 3.8). the availability of more extensive data has led to improvements in these efforts. researchers have made contributions in informing treatment strategies. but in comparison with other infectious diseases, we still have limited epidemiological data on NTDs. this means that we need to be cautious about overstating our results. IMPROVED CASE FINDING AND TREATMENT Leprosy, the Gambian form of sleeping sickness (human africa trypanosomiasis), visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent, and Chagas disease are four London Declaration NTDs. they have long, variable periods between infection and symptomatic disease and, generally, late diagnosis. the relative infectiousness and duration of the symptomatic phase will determine the population-level impact of diagnosing and treating cases earlier. vector control or other mass interventions could reduce both symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission by reducing all transmissions. we would need to separate asymptomatics into presymptomatic and nonsymptomatic. the balance between infectivity, duration of infection, and frequency of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection may undermine any attempt to control a disease solely by increased case finding. this can be mitigated by reducing all infectivity through vector control or other transmission-reducing interventions, which reduce the infectivity of all infected invidiuals. how to identify and target high-risk groups to screen Visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent [27] 4 phases of interventions: preparatory phase, 5-year attack phase with ACD and high-coverage IRS. 3-year consolidation phase with limited IRS and intensified ACD, maintenance phase to ensure elimination target sustained. a key question for sleeping sickness is the potential contribution of vector control as a complement to screening and treating. a key question for sleeping sickness is the potential contribution of vector control as a complement to screening and treating. s are falling drastically, reducing the burden of disease, but there is debate around the drivers of this decline, the size and nature of any asymptomatic pool, and the risk of resurgence. modeling acts as a tool to investigate some of the possible scenarios and evaluate different policy interventions in response to them. the recent modeling of the different stages of the control effort suggests there should be some accounting for underlying transmission rates when selecting interventions. infected individuals are uninfected because they have been protected due to the ongoing MDA program, which is a measure of the program\u2019s success. a number of factors could undermine the success of a mass drug administration program. schistosomiasis is caused by intestinal worms that are passed in feces or urine and contaminate the environment. the eggs then go on to infect snails, the parasite is amplified and rereleased into the water, and humans are infected through contact with that water. current guidelines suggest that treatments should be targeted at children. onchocerciasis is transmitted by mosquitoes and a risk factor for elephantiasis, and onchocerciasis, transmitted by black flies. the campaign has been particularly successful, with billions of treatments given and recent scale-back of treatment in areas where the targets have been met. the modeling work discusses the alternative strategies and the potential for MDA combined with vector control to accelerate or achieve elimination. all of the articles on MDA policies highlight the importance of the epidemiological setting, the appropriate group being targeted, and systematic nonadherence. the issue of systematic nonadherence has been highlighted in modeling studies for many years but has recently become a point of focus again. these definitions are part of a shifting landscape that is dependent on a changing epidemiology, demography, and on the availability of new tools. addressing these diseases could shift to a test-and-treat campaign or even case management. despite the large number of biological unknowns or uncertainties for NTDs, the slower dynamics allow us to develop our insights as data become more available. the modeling analyses in this special issue demonstrate that 2020 goals for NTDs are likely to be met in a large number of areas."}
