{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first discovered in a patient suffering from acute pneumonia and renal failure on June 13, 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. there is no zoonotic MERS-CoV disease reported in Africa. dromedary camels are the main source for virus transmission to humans. the current recommended control strategies for MERS-CoV infection in camels are regular active surveillance, control of camel movement in the infected areas, use of personal protective equipment during handling of camels. there is limited data on the prevalence of the virus in different countries. 127 nasal swabs and 198 serum samples of camels were collected from seven areas in the saint-Louis region. in Tunisia, a total of 1170 nasal swabs and 782 serum samples were collected from adult camels at seven markets. dilutions of 200 L heat-inactivated sera (56 \u00b0C for 30 min) were made. the serum dilutions were mixed with equal volumes of 200 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of dromedary MERS-CoV Egypt NRCE-HKU270. after 1h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 35 L of the virus\u2013serum mixture was added to each well. the PCR products were then subjected to a second PCR round with RBD-MERS-F: (CGAAGCAAAACCTTCTGGCT) and RBD-MERS-R: (ATATTCCACGCA ATTGCCTA) primers. final PCR product was gel purified then sequenced with the same primers. the majority of camels were imported from Sudan and sampled within no more than 10 days of importation. two local farms breeding herds in Esna (South of Egypt, 49 camels) and Matrouh (Northwest coastal region, 65 camels) were longitudinally sampled. serum dilutions of 200 L heat-inactivated sera (56 \u00b0C for 30 min) were mixed with equal volumes of 200 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of dromedary MERS-CoV Egypt NRCE-HKU270. after 1h of incubation, 35 L of the virus\u2013serum mixture was added to each well. the spike gene containing the RBD was amplified using pre-RBD-MERS-F and pre-RBD-MERS-R primers in the first round using one step RT-PCR kit. the final PCR product was gel purified then sequenced with the same primers at the Macrogen sequencing facility. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method by applying the neighbor-joining method. the prevalence rate of MERS-CoV RNA in 4331 nasal swabs collected from the seven countries was 4.7%. male camels had a significantly higher detection rate of MERS-CoV than female camels. no significant difference in the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in male and female camels was detected. 187 129 (68.9) 187 3 (1.6) Farm 924 474 (51.2) 944 33 (3.4) Quarantine 164 143 (87.1) 164 2 (1.2) Slaughterhouse 449 401 (89.3) 649 133 (20.4) p-value 0.0001 0.0001 Governorate Aswan 340 300 (88.2) 317 4 (1.2) Beheira 68 39 (57.3) 68 3 (4.4) Cairo 202 178 (8 ug 37 36 (97.2) 21 0 (0) Rao 34 0 34 2 (5.8) p-value 0.0001 ns Age Juvenile 17 5 (29.4) 15 2 (13.3) Adult 181 124 (68.5) 112 5 (4.4) p-value 0.01 ns Sex Male 16 7 (43.7) 15 2 (13.3) Female 182 122 (67) 112 5 (4.4) p-value ns ns ns Total KSA Sampling Site Alkhomra 36 29 (80.5) 36 1 (2.7) alsheaeba 17 10 (58.8) 17 0 (0) Asfan 62 56 (90.3) 62 0 (0) Dahban 26 19 (73.07) 26 3 (11.5) Khlees 10 8 (80) 11 0 (0) Mecca 19 17 (89.4) 19 0 (0) Umm al Jurm 12 10 (83.3) 13 0 (0) Alad ns total 32 14 (43.7) 26 0 (0) Among eight governorates of Egypt, Qalubiya showed the highest seroprevalence rate (93.5%) males tended to have a higher seropositivity rate than females. the virus\u2019 RNA was detected in four villages (Gandon, Ndaye, Gantour, and Rao) there was no significant difference in the detection rate of MERS-CoV in camels of Senegal based on age or sex. no statistical difference between adult and juvenile camels in Tunisia. 224 nasal swabs, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in seven samples (3.1%) there was no statistical difference in the detected MERS-CoV by age or sex. the virus was not detected in a total of 304 nasal swabs collected from camels. two sequences obtained from camels in KSA were distinct from previously detected viruses in Saudi Arabia. the three sequences obtained from Senegal were closely related to cluster B circulating in Asia. ls were seronegative while the three remaining camels had antibody titers ranging from 160 to 320. infection was not previously detected in samples collected in september. the virus was not detected in samples collected in september. camels that were sampled had MERS-CoV antibodies ranging from 6.8 to 8 log2. all the camels that were sampled had MERS-CoV antibodies. 1401 (68.9%) were positive (Figure 1). seroprevalence rates differed significantly by sampling collection site.

Iraq The virus was not detected in a total of 26 nasal swabs collected from camels. the seroprevalence rate of MERS-CoV in camels ranged from 29% to 46%. the overall geometric mean titer of MERS-CoV antibodies within the herd was 5.3 log2. a herd of 49 adult camels imported from Sudan and locally residing in a breeding farm at Esna in Egypt was sampled four times from 20 April 2016 to 30 May 2016. the virus was detected in 13 camels at the third follow up [2 (10), 2 (20), 8 (40), 1 (80)] tested camels in seven countries had MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. virus RNA was detected in Egypt, Senegal, KSA, and Tunisia. none of the infected camels in the four countries showed any clinical signs of infection. the prevalence of MERS-CoV varied significantly by sampling collection site, governorate, sex, age, and origin of animals. imported camels had higher seroprevalence rate and rtRT-PCR positive cases of MERS-CoV than resident camels. the dromedary camels in Senegal have 65.1% seroprevalence rate of antibody to MERS-CoV. the overall seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in Iraq was 43.7%. there was no significant difference in seropositivity to MERS-CoV between the two provinces in Iraq. a longitudinal study on three dromedary camels\u2019 herds showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. all juvenile camels in the Matrouh herd showed low antibody titer. two Egyptian herds had evidence of MERS-CoV infection in state of the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. the very high seroprevalence detected in camels warrants the initiation of an active surveillance study for MERS-CoV in humans. the study is needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease and dynamics of infection."}
