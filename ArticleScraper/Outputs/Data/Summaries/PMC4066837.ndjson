{"summary": "IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. in mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4/IL-13 signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection. RV increased eosinophilic inflammation in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice. CD206 is increased in the asthmatic patients and correlates with the severity of asthma. IL-4 signaling regulates the state of macrophage activation and the pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. we hypothesized that in the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection would preferentially increase type 1 cytokine production from conventionally-activated macrophages. female 8 wk-old mice were injected intraperitoneally on days 0 and 7 with 0.2 ml PBS or a solution of alum and 100 g OVA. mice were challenged intranasally with 50 l of PBS or 100 g OVA. arrow cells were plated onto 12-well culture dishes at 1 106 cells/ml. cells were stimulated for 1.5 h with medium or RV1B (multiplicity of infection, 10) and harvested 8 or 24 h after infection for RNA and protein analysis.

RNA was extracted with Trizol (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed for cytokine and chemokine gene expression.

RV alone had modest effects on airway neutrophilic inflammation and responsiveness. the identity of neutrophils and eosinophils was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for neutrophil elastase and major basic protein. RV infection increases the number of airway neutrophils per lung in wild-type and IL-4R KO mice. the neutrophil response was significantly higher in IL-4R KO mice. airway cholinergic responsiveness was assessed by measuring changes in respiratory system resistance in response to increasing doses of nebulized methacholine. data from wild type (D) and IL-4R KO mice (E) are shown. cytokine expression in lungs of wild-type and IL-4R KO mice was significantly higher. wild-type or IL-4R KO mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA. after 24 h, lungs were collected and gene expression measured by qPCR. -4R KO mice showed reduced expression of the M2a markers CCL17 and CCL24. there was no change in the response of IL-10 and CD86, M2b markers or CXCL13, an M2c marker. IL-4R KO macrophages showed more potent \u201cclassical\u201d M1 cytokine responses to RV infection. M2c marker CXCL13 (D), the classical M1 markers TNF-, IFN-, IL-12p40 and CXCL10, IFN- (E) and IL-17A protein levels were assessed with ELISA. data suggest that IL-4 signaling is required for alternative activation of lung macrophages and production of. eight-week old wild-type or IL-4R KO mice were treated with PBS or OVA by intraperitoneal injection (days 0, 7) and intranasal installation (days 12, 13) mice were intranasally inoculated with sham or RV on day 14. expression of CD11b and IL-13 was analyzed among CD45+ cells. wild-type or IL-4R KO mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA. selected mice were inoculated with sham or RV. Lungs were harvested and digested with collagenase IV. Lung sections stained with anti-IL-17A antibody. immunohistochemistry shows DAB staining of round cells in the airway subepithelium. RV infection induces the release of chemokines from airway epithelial cells. RV colocalizes with eotaxin-producing, CD68+ lung macrophages. this suggests RV causes asthma exacerbations in part by infection of alternatively-activated macrophages. 2-polarized lung macrophages and IL-13+ CD11b+ cells produced. these cells produced neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation. IL-4 signaling is required for lung macrophage M2 polarization. resistance has been attributed to the higher potential of classically- and alternatively-active macrophages to produce nitric oxide. in allergen-sensitized and -challenged mice, either classically- and alternatively-active macrophages may contribute to RV-induced airway inflammation. we speculate that M1 macrophages are not protective against RV because the inflammatory response does not depend on viral load. IL-4 KO mice have previously shown increased neutrophils upon ovalbumin exposure. only 50% of asthma cases are due to eosinophilic inflammation, the rest showing airway neutrophils. effects of RV1B infection on wild-type mice are indistinguishable from those of RV16, a major group virus, on transgenic human ICAM-1 mice [63]. major and minor group viruses induce nearly identical patterns of gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells [64] interests Dr. Hershenson has performed consulting work for Boehringer-ingelheim and Almirall. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
