{"summary": "traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids impair the ability of the body to fight infection. this may prove catastrophic if an appropriate antibiotic is not chosen. in recent years, the early use of steroid therapy has become established in a wide range of infective conditions. systematic reviews published since 1999 formed the mainstay of analysis. trials published more recently, or not considered by the reviews, were also included. studies in a sicker septic population reported either survival benefit or reduction in catecholamine requirements with longer courses ( 5 days) of lower stress doses of corticosteroids. this shift to an 'adrenal replacement' dose arose from the recognition that relative adrenal insufficiency was a common phenomenon in sepsis and a poor prognostic factor. we believe steroids should be used only in tetracosactrin non-responders. steroid therapy consisted of either dexamethasone (0.4 to 0.9 mg/kg), hydrocortisone, prednisolone or a combination. mortality rates with and without steroid therapy were 8.5% and 11.6%. significant benefit was found when treating Streptococcus pneumoniae and \"species other than Haemophilus influenzae\" a large randomised trial of paediatric meningitis in a developing country with late presentation of disease, high levels of resistance to available antimicrobials. the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in avoiding this complication was investigated. a randomised, non-blinded trial of prednisolone versus placebo in 251 HIV positive patients revealed a significant mortality reduction at 31 and 84 days. corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone) was routinely used during the outbreak of the coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the rapid emergence of the syndrome prevented the establishment of randomised controlled trials. systematic review of randomised trials in mechanically ventilated infants found no significant decrease in the duration of ventilation or hospital admission with systemic dexamethasone. other trials have shown benefit with steroids, with a reduction in hospital stay in non-ventilated infants [30,31] and in the need for hospital admission for children presenting with bronchiolitis to the emergency room [32]. steroids have been used as adjunctive treatment since the 1950s. mortality is still around 20% to 30%, with neurological sequelae common in survivors. the effect of prednisolone on mortality, functional status and need for repeat pericardiocentesis was studied. the effect of prednisolone on mortality, functional status and need for repeat pericardiocentesis was studied. a recent randomised trial of 383 patients stratified patients by disease type. pleural tuberculosis showed no significant reduction in mortality, a non-significant increase in recurrence, and a higher rate of Kaposi sarcoma. there can as yet be no recommendation for the use of steroids in this group, and the evidence is still lacking for non-HIV infected individuals. the primary endpoint was treatment failure defined as the need for extra or repeated treatment of the exacerbation, or mortality. steroids reduced this risk (odds ratio 0.48 (CI 0.34 to 0.68), NNT 9) but no difference was seen in mortality. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Chronic hepatitis B A systematic review found 13 adequate trials of steroid therapy prior to interferon- involving 790 patients. no difference in mortality, hepatitis e surface antigen, hepatitis B e antibody, liver histology, or quality of life. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation B. Idiopathic facial nerve (Bell's) palsy A review considered 4 trials, with 179 patients. there was no improvement in recovery of motor function, or presence of synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction. results are at odds with previously published analyses, which have recommended steroids. a partially blinded trial of steroids as adjunct to surgery in typhoid perforation gave a similar mortality reduction, again with trial numbers being small. steroids should be used in severe typhoid, particularly with shock, delirium, or coma, after the exclusion of other bacterial meningitis. use has been supported by an early study of 98 patients. there is no case fatality difference amongst the 97 and 63 children randomised in each study. steroids cannot yet be recommended on this basis for dengue shock syndrome. a recent trial of prophylactic 20 mg prednisolone to prevent reversal reaction resulted in a significant reduction in nerve damage at 4 months, but no statistically significant change at 12 months. a trial of higher dose prednisolone for established impaired nerve function did not show any greater likelihood of improvement compared with placebo. a small trial of 108 patients has suggested that 1 mg/kg prednisolone for 10 days should be used to treat solitary granuloma stage neurocysticercosis. recommendation Prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 10 days should be used to treat solitary granuloma stage neurocysticercosis. a rebound increase in plasma cytokine levels at three days prompted the recommendation subgroup analysis of trials using low dose steroids showed significant reduction in 28 day mortality (relative risk) 0.8 (confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95), hospital mortality (RR 0.83 to 0.97) and shock reversal at both 7 days (RR 1.6 (CI 1.01 to 2.01)) and 28 days (RR 1.21 (CI 1.04 to 1.52)) grade of evidence IV; grade of recommendation E. Recommendation 2 Hydrocortisone can be started pending the laboratory results and discontinued if the rise in cortisol level following 250 g tetracosactrin exceeds 9 g/l. mortality rates with and without steroid therapy were 8.5% and 11.6%, respectively. significant benefit was found when treating Streptococcus pneumoniae and \"species other than Haemophilus influenzae\" a large randomised trial of paediatric meningitis showed no effect on survival or neurological sequelae. Recommendation Dexamethasone 10 mg qds or equivalent should be given for 48 hours, preferably commencing prior to antibiotic therapy. grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A. Pneumocystis pneumonia Patients may suffer deterioration in pulmonary function after initiation of antimicrobials. recommandation Prednisolone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 10 days should be given to adult patients with PaO2 9.3 kPa or alveolar-arterial gradient >4.7 kPa. grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation A. corticosteroid use was associated with a doubling in adverse outcomes. a 20.7-fold increase in risk of either intensive care unit admission or mortality. a systematic review of randomised trials in mechanically ventilated infants. grade of recommendation C. Recommendation 2 Steroids should not be used in children with bronchiolitis who are ventilated. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Croup A cochrane review of 24 studies involving 2,878 patients demonstrated significant benefit from a single dose. steroid group showed an absolute risk reduction of 9.2% over placebo. no significant reduction for death and severe disability combined. a recent randomised trial of 383 patients stratified patients by disease type. the effect of prednisolone on mortality, functional status and need for repeat pericardiocentesis was studied. no significant effect on functional status at 10 years. Recommendation 1 Steroids should not be given for tuberculous pleurisy in non-HIV positive patients. grade of evidence I; grade of recommendation B. Recommendation 2 Steroids cannot yet be recommended for tuberculous pleurisy in non-HIV positive patients. prednisolone therapy on immune activation and CD4(+) T cell counts did not outweigh the risks of adverse events (a transient increase in HIV RNA levels, worsening of underlying hypertension, fluid retention and hyperglycemia) steroids may be considered for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly those with extensive disease, but not in HIV-positive patients. this may be in the form of 30 mg prednisolone daily for 14 days. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Cystic fibrosis A review of 10 trials of inhaled steroids in cystic fibrosis did not find any difference in lung function testing, or the number of days treatment with antibiotics. no effect on all-cause or liver-related mortality, virological response, biochemistry, or liver biopsy findings. one trial reported significant reduction in side-effects of interferon with concurrent steroid use. methylprednisolone tapering from 48 mg daily over 12 weeks. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Malaria Adjunctive steroid has been used to improve mortality and neurological sequelae, both of which are common. review found two adequate trials with a total of 143 patients. a partially blinded trial of steroids as adjunct to surgery in typhoid perforation gave a similar mortality reduction, again with trial numbers being small. the effect of adjuvant dexamethasone compared to antibiotics alone was studied in one randomized controlled trial. the effect of adjuvant dexamethasone compared to antibiotics alone was studied in one randomized controlled trial. 98 patients have been used to treat dengue shock syndrome. steroid use has been supported by an early study of 98 patients. there is no case fatality difference amongst the 97 and 63 children randomised in each study. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Leprosy Steroids are recommended by the WHO for new nerve damage in leprosy. case series have demonstrated improved nerve function in up to 88% of ambulatory patients after 40 mg prednisolone daily for 12 to 20 weeks. Grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Onchocerciasis Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae are usually treated with ivermectin. when diethlycarbamazine is used there is a significantly increased chance of reaction to the lysed microfilariae. this reaction comprises itching, rash, fever, tachycardia and hypotension, and is sometimes fatal. prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 10 days should be used to treat granuloma stage neurocysticercosis. grade of evidence II; grade of recommendation C. Conclusion We present a synthesis of diverse evidence related to steroid use in infections."}
