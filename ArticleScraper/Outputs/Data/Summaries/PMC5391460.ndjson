{"summary": "Hantaviruses contain a tripartite negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. they encode nucleocapsid protein (NP), glycoprotein (GP) and viral RNA-dependent polymerase protein (RdRp) humans become infected by inhaling contaminated aerosols or by coming into contact with rodent excreta. lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is an essential architectural constituent of paraspeckles in the mammalian nucleus. to date, two isoform transcripts of the NEAT1 gene have been identified. lncRNA NEAT1 expression is induced by HTNV in a time- and dose-dependent manner. values are means standard deviation (SD) (n = 5; *, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.0001; compared with the mock group) different cell lines were infected with HTNV and followed by immunostaining at 48 hpi. NP (green) and nuclei stained with DAPI (blue) expression levels of NEAT1 were assessed in HUVECs or HEK293, HeLa, or A549 cells by qRT-PCR at different infection MOIs. at least three independent experiments were performed with similar results. lncRNA NEAT1 was found to be upregulated by viral infection. the difference between the 60Co-inactivated HTNV group and the mock group was not significant (P = 1.75 1014, FDR = 3.10 1013); however, the difference between the 60Co-inactivated HTNV group and the mock group was not significant. NEAT1 expression increased from an MOI of 0.1 to 1, indicating that the elevation occurred in a viral dose-dependent manner. we wondered how NEAT1 could reciprocally influence HTNV replication in HUVECs. HUVECs in six-well plates were transfected with NC sequences, si-NEAT1 or the stealth siRNA NEAT1-2 (st-NEAT1-2) twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 0.1 for 48 h. s are means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.01; Student's t test, compared with the NC group). the propagated HTNV was acquired at 72 hpi, and viral titers were detected by TCID50 with ELISA in Vero E6 cells. the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1 for 48 h. the expression of HTNV NP was measured by Western blotting. the expression of HTNV S segment was measured by qRT-PCR. overexpression of NEAT1 with both pCMV-NEAT1-1 and pCMV-NEAT1-2 could conspicuously repress HTNV NP expression. overexpression of NEAT1-2 instead of NEAT1-1 could efficiently suppress HTNV replication in HUVECs. EAT1-2 transcription appeared at 8 hpi at an MOI of 0.1 or at 20 hpi at an MOI of 1. expression of endogenous IFN- mRNA was much lower in cells transfected with si-NEAT1-2 at both 0.1 and 1. overexpression of NEAT1 in HUVECs increased IFN- expression after HTNV infection. HUVECs were transfected with either 60Co-inactivated HTNV or HTNV at an MOI of 0.1 or 1. values are means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.01; Student's t test, compared with the 60Co-inactivated HTNV group). s were transfected with NC or si-NEAT1-2 and, 24 h later, were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 0.1. Decreasing amounts of polyclonal sheep neutralizing antibodies against IFN- and IFN- (anti-IFN) were added starting at 12 hpi. DDX60 was recently reported as an important activator of RIG-I. but the antiviral effects of DDX60 remain a subject of debate. the upregulated RIG-I and DDX60 were blocked in cells with low NEAT1-2 expression. HTNV at an MOI of 1 was subjected to visualization of RIG-I (red) and DDX60 (green) by immunostaining at 48 hpi. hek293 cells were transfected with NC sequences, si-RIG-I-2, si-DDX60-1, or both si-RIG-I-2 and si-DDX60-1. twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with HTNV at an MO 93 cells were transfected with flag-RIG-I, pUNO-DDX60 or both. the cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 5. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of IFN- (I) in HEK293 cells. I-2 and siRNA-DDX60-1 with the highest knockdown efficiency by qRT-PCR in HUVECs. knockdown of both of them significantly promoted HTNV NP expression. overexpression of either RIG-I or DDX60 inhibited viral replication. relocalization of SFPQ could inhibit HTNV replication (Fig. 5F and G) SFPQ has been suggested to bind to the promoter region of RIG-I and DDX60 (11), thus preventing the expression of RIG-I and DDX60. the results suggest that NEAT1 might relocate SFPQ from the potential promoter region to paraspeckles in the nucleus. t-NEAT1-2, or si-SFPQ and, 24 h later, were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1. the transcription of HTNV S segment (G) (n = 3), RIG-I (H) (n = 3), and DDX60 (I) (n = 3) was detected by qRT-PCR at 2 dpi. values are means SD (*, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; one-way ANOVA) qRT-PCR was performed to assess NEAT1 expression levels. the experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results. the transcription factor IRF7, rather than IRF3 and p65, translocated into the nucleus in HTNV-infected HUVECs at 2 dpi. HTNV caused transcriptional activation of the NEAT1 gene, probably via the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway. NEAT1 transcription levels after HTNV infection were analyzed by qRT-PCR in NC-transfected or IRF7 silenced HUVECs. values are means SD (*, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the NC+HTNV group). cell-based experiments revealed that NEAT1-2 is a crucial regulator of innate antihantaviral responses. knockdown mice were injected intravenously with si-NEAT1-2 (1 g/g) or nontarget control siRNA (1 g/g); 1 day later, they were infected with HTNV (100 LD50) by intramuscular injection. the knockdown efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR in kidney, liver, and spleen samples at 2 dpi. mice were sacrificed at 3 dpi, and livers, spleens, and kidneys were collected for ELISA detection of HTNV NP titers. values are means SD (n = 8; *, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; Student's t test, compared with the NC+HTNV group). four mice in each group were analyzed by flow cytometry at 3 dpi. results obtained for three mice in each group are presented. NEAT1 transcription is activated by HTNV in a time- and dose-dependent manner. all cells could be infected by HTNV and generated hantavirus progeny. NEAT1 elevation at 2 hpi may have been unrelated to the virus. HTNV infection increased NEAT1 and not NEAT1-1 suppresses HTNV replication. depletion of NEAT1-2 alone could mimic antiviral effects of simultaneous silencing. expressions of HTNV mRNA of S segment and HTNV titers increased after NEAT1 silencing. cells expressing FAM were calculated by flow cytometry. in-cell Western analysis for HTNV NP was performed at 48 hpi. in-cell Western analysis for HTNV NP staining was performed at 48 hpi. at 48 hpi, the expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR. values are means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.0001; Student's t test, compared with the vector group). the propagated HTNV was acquired at 72 hpi, and viral titers were detected by ELISA. plasmids, of which pCMV-NEAT1-1 is transcribed into the 2- to 3-kb NEAT1-2 (MEN), were applied to directly investigate the role of NEAT1 in HTNV infection. overexpression of NEAT1 with both pCMV-NEAT1-1 and pCMV-NEAT1-2 could conspicuously IFN- production or pretreatment at an early infection stage plays an important role in limiting HTNV infection. IFN- treatment after 24 hpi exerts little antiviral effect (12, 13) hantaviruses suppressed IFN- expression of host cells at an early stage of infection. overexpression could inhibit or increase the promoter activity of the IFN- gene after HTNV infection. ectopically expressing NEAT1-2 without HTNV infection could not inhibit or enhance IFN- expression in HUVECs. IFN- expression at different time points was assessed by qRT-PCR. Detection for luciferase reporter activities driven by the IFN- promoter was done in siRNA or plasmid-pretransfected HUVECs without HTNV infection. treatment with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of IFN- and IFN- could counteract antiviral effects of NEAT1-2. the compensatory effects were dependent on the magnitude of the NAbs. the results showed that NEAT1-2 enhanced the host antihantaviral innate immune responses by regulating IFN- signaling. HUVECs transfected with HTNV at an MOI of 1 were subjected to visualization of RIG-I (red) and DDX60 (green) by immunostaining at 48 hpi. expression levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, RIG-I, DDX60, and MDA5 were measured. luciferase gene harboring the IFN- promoter was transfected with si-RIG-I-2 and/or si-DDX60-1 in HEK293 cells. after 24 h, the HEK293 cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 5. values are means SD (n = 5; *, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; one-way ANOVA) the experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results. we then found that RIG-I and DDX60 colocalized after HTNV infection. NEAT1 HTNV infection regulates expression of RIG-I and DDX60. the protein level of SFPQ, as well as another paraspeckle-forming constituent, NONO, remained unchanged after HTNV infection. however, SFPQ became centralized rather than diffuse in the nucleus after HTNV infection. the levels of paraspeckle proteins SFPQ and NONO in HUVECs or HeLa cells were assessed by Western blotting at the indicated time points after HTNV infection (B) or posttransfection with plasmids or siRNA (C) the enhanced interplay between SFPQ and NONO after HTNV infection was verified by co-IP. HEK293 cells failed to induce NEAT1 expression, suggesting that NEAT1 transcription was closely related to live viral replication. the upregulation of NEAT1 by HTNV could not be reversed by applying IFN-I neutralizing antibodies. ECs were stimulated with IL-1 (F) or TNF- (G) at various doses for 12 h. then qRT-PCR was performed to assess NEAT1 expression levels. values are means SD (*, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; one-way ANOVA) Huh7, Huh7.5, EVC-304, and EVC304 TLR4 cells were infected with HTNV at an MOI of 1, followed by immunostaining at 48 hpi. NP (green) and nuclei stained with DAPI (blue) are shown. body weight loss in NEAT1-2-depleted mice was observed from 2 dpi to 5 dpi. the IFN production in serum was remarkably decreased in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than those in the NC group at 3 dpi. the virus titers in related organs were higher in the NEAT1-2 silenced group than in the NC group at 3 dpi. the effects of NEAT1 on HTNV virulence in mice were determined by body weight loss from 0 to 10 dpi. the effects of NEAT1 on HTNV infection kinetics at 3 dpi were determined by qRT-PCR in kidney, liver, and spleen samples. livers in the NC group showed inflammatory cell infiltration in certain regions. livers in the si-NEAT1-2 group showed inflammatory cell infiltration. kidneys in the si-NEAT1-2 group showed slight acute viral hepatitis. long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as important regulators of gene expression. TLR2 controls lncRNA-COX2 expression in a MyD88- and NF-B-dependent manner. lncRNA Lethe acts as a negative feedback regulator of NF-B signaling. ies virus has been reported to activate the transcription of different lncRNAs in host cells (11, 24\u201326) multiple lncRNAs have been shown to affect the IFN response in recent years. CMPK2 and NRAV were identified as negative regulators of IFN immune reactions. NEAT1 promotes IFN secretion, most likely by enhancing RIG-I and DDX60 expression. DDX60 activates endogenous RIG-I, thereby promoting the RIG-I signaling-related IFN response. the role of NEAT1 in hantaviral infection remains unclear. HTNV primarily targets vascular endothelial cells in vivo. it contributes to increased vascular permeability and coagulation disorders in HFRS. HTNV is the most common in vitro cell model to study host innate immunity against HTNV infection or viral pathogenesis. analysis was applied to qualify HTNV NP production. NP spotted and exhibited in the ICW results forms obvious stains. intensity represented the quantity of NP production but could not directly indicate the virulence, which was better shown by plaque-forming assays. this is the first study to describe the role of NEAT1 in HTNV infection. HTNV infection induced NEAT1 expression through the RIG-I\u2013IRF7 pathway. NEAT1 displayed positive feedback for RIG-I signaling. this phenomenon would facilitate the expression of DDX60 and RIG-I.
