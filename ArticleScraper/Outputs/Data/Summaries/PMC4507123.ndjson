{"summary": "cytokines are small soluble proteins secreted by immune cells in response to diverse external stimuli. cytokine signaling (signal 3) is critical for functional maturation of this response into appropriate effector lineages with helper, cytotoxic, memory, or antibody-secreting potential. these cytokine families encompass both proinflammatory and suppressive members. cytokine-driven cellular influxes and expansions promote inflammation that ultimately leads to the clearance of infection. cytokine storms typically subside once the infection is eliminated or when the autoimmune response is curtailed by negative feedback circuits provided by suppressive cytokines. IL-10 is minimally expressed by unstimulated cells and often requires commensal- or pathogen-driven upregulation. if activated through innate or adaptive pathways, IL-10 plays a major regulatory role in dampening most inflammatory responses. mice that lack Il10 exhibit profound immune polarization and succumb to colitis. cytokines endowed with suppressive activity belong to the IL-12 family of cytokines. IL-10, IL-27 and IL-35 are minimally expressed in human tissues. IL-12 family belongs to the IL-6 superfamily of type I cytokines. IL-12 (p35/p40), IL-23 (p19/p40), IL-27 (p28/Ebi3), and IL-35 (p35/Ebi3) are predominantly proinflammatory, while IL-27 and IL-35 are suppressive cytokines. existence of monomers and homodimers has been reported, which function as natural antagonists of bioactive cytokine signaling. signal transduction through these receptor chains is mediated through the JAK-STAT pathway. key Janus kinases mediating STAT phosphorylation for the IL-12 family members are JAK2 and either TYK2. IL-12 signals primarily through pSTAT4, IL-23 through pSTAT3 and pSTAT4 and IL-27 through pSTAT1 and pSTAT3. IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 secreted by activated antigen-presenting cells. IL-12 stimulates IFN- production from both NK and T cells. similar to IL-12, IL-23 can also drive Th1 proliferation. IL-27 was demonstrated to inhibit Th17 differentiation by targeting the Th17 transcription factors, RORt, ROR, and RORc. IL-27 also promotes the generation of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells through induction of the transcription factor, cMaf, cytokine IL-21, and costimulatory receptor, ICOS. early beginnings of IL-35 Biology and its Addition to the Treg Arsenal IL-12 was identified and purified from cell culture media of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines. p35/p40 expression was ubiquitous, while p40 seemed restricted and inducible. this dissociation between p35 and p40 gene regulation had hinted at possibility that either or both of these subunits might have additional partners. p35/Ebi3 heterodimer was produced by regulatory T cells. IL-35 subunits are constitutively secreted by mouse Foxp3+ Tregs. expression was further boosted following coculture of Tregs with effector T cells. this heterodimer suppressed CD4+CD25+ Treg cells without induction of additional Foxp3 expression while retaining their suppressive function. the addition of IL-35 to the Treg cell arsenal in 2007 sparked tremendous enthusiasm in the Treg field as there has been continued interest in identifying novel mechanisms of Treg suppression. IL-35 has only been shown to exhibit suppressive activities and mechanisms. this is supported by experiments demonstrating the failure of Ebi3- and IL-12-deficient Tregs to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro and in a wide variety of inflammatory scenarios in vivo. ant IL-35 administration reduces Th17 differentiation and function. IL-35 significantly attenuated allergic airway inflammation by reducing the Th2 effector and humoral responses. mouse iTr35 cells exhibited potent suppressive potential in 5 distinct disease models. inflammatory milieu generated following parasite infection (T. muris) and tumor inoculation (B16 and MC38) induced iTr35 cells. iTr35 cells suppressed primary human T-cell proliferation through IL-35. iTr35 cells displayed increased stability and retained suppressor potential relative to TGF-induced counterparts. inhibition of effector T-cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, modulating T-cell differentiation programs, expansion of regulatory T cells, and induction of iTr35 cells emerge as key mechanisms for IL-35-mediated regulatory functions. IL-10 has accounted for most of the regulatory function ascribed to these regulatory B cell subsets. despite the lack of a unifying signature, IL-10 has accounted for most of the regulatory function ascribed to these regulatory B cell subsets. however, IL-10-producing Breg cells have also been identified in humans. bone marrow chimeric mice were generated with B cells lacking either the p35 or p35 chain of IL-35. these mice developed exacerbated EAE and were protected from S. typhimurium (Salmonella)-induced sepsis relative to controls. recombinant IL-35 treatment induced IL-10-secreting Bregs. IL-35 or IL-35+ Breg cells efficiently controlled initial and established stages of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) this IL-35+ Breg-mediated protection was dependent on increased induction and expansion of endogenous Bregs and Foxp3+ Tregs and inhibition of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 effector cells. this analysis revealed that CD138hi plasma cells were the major source of IL-10 and IL-35 in vivo. loss of IL-10 completely abrogated the suppressive effects of rIL-35. this was compatible with their in vitro studies demonstrating that addition of the neutralizing IL-10 antibody abrogated the suppressive effects of rIL-35. IL-35 treatment of human B cells also induces IL-10 expression while inhibiting B-cell proliferation. a unique STAT1:STAT4 heterodimer was identified as the major downstream mediator of IL-35 signaling. IL-35 signals through a receptor comprising IL-12R2 and IL-27R and activates STAT1 and STAT3 in B cells. gp130 is ubiquitous in its expression, but IL-12R2 is fairly restricted. IL-12R2 is undetectable on most resting T cells, but gets rapidly induced in the presence of cytokines, such as IL-2, IFN-, IL-12, IL-27, and TNF. phenotypes attributed to either IL-12 or IL-27 could be features attributed to IL-35. IL-35 mediates suppressive effects in models of inflammatory bowel disease, EAE, collagen-induced arthritis, myocarditis. IL-35 expression conferred protection in mouse models of allergic airway inflammation, colitis, and diabetes. more recent studies have expanded the protective effects of IL-35 overexpression to murine acute graft-versus-host disease, viral myocarditis, and atherosclerosis. IL-35 production by tolerogenic dendritic cells remains to be explored. high Ebi3 expression in lung cancer cells promoted tumor progression. siRNA-mediated Ebi3 gene silencing inhibited cancer cell proliferation. depletion of MDSCs with anti-Gr1 mAb abrogated tumor progression. IL-35 produced by tumor cells was also shown to play a role in making the tumor cells resistant to CTL-mediated destruction. gp130 signaling has been associated with cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. a human CD8+ regulatory T cell population expressing CTLA-4 and secreting IL-35 has been shown to regulate the antitumor immune response in prostate cancer. increased serum IL-35 levels seem to correlate with the severity of malignancy and the clinical stage of the tumor. colorectal cancer Serum IL-35 levels are positively correlated with Treg numbers in the peripheral blood of colorectal cancer patients and reduction in serum IL-35 following tumor resection Zeng and others (2013) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Increased plasma IL-35 levels associated with lymph node metastasis and late-stage tumor Jin and others (2013) Acute myeloid leukemia Increased plasma IL-35 concentration has also been correlative in plasma IL-35 levels were significantly decreased in patients with stable and unstable angina pectoris (SAP and UAP) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Lin and others (2012). these observations can be reconciled to highlight critical information about this inhibitory cytokine. IL-35+ populations impairs the antitumor immune response (CD8 effector, CD4 effector, and B cells) on the other end of the spectrum lie autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. IL-35 deficiency results in activation of autoreactive cells, leading to the exacerbated inflammation associated with experimental autoimmune encephalitis. iTr35 cells and IL-35+ Bregs through infectious tolerance. this may be particularly relevant in tumor settings that are heavily infiltrated with IL-35-producing Tregs, Bregs, and other suppressive populations. approaches that boost or target IL-35 may result in recruitment or blockade of both the B and T cell arms of the immune response. il-35 receptor utilization is largely unknown. il-35 receptors can mediate suppression and IL-10 induction. il-35 receptors can mediate proinflammatory events when activated. more in-depth studies are warranted using recombinant IL-35 and specialized mouse models proposed above in appropriate cellular lines to fully appreciate the physiological impact of IL-35. understanding the cross talk between the various IL-35+ cell populations in diverse disease settings will greatly aid in effective manipulation of IL-35 for translational benefit."}
