{"summary": "paramyxoviruses: An Expanding Group of Important Viral Pathogens Hendra virus and Nipah virus are the only identified zoonotic members of the paramyxovirus family. both are highly pathogenic in humans, and both are highly pathogenic in humans. HMPV is a long-term human pathogen that was only identified by careful analysis of samples from children with respiratory tract disease for which an etiological agent had not been identified. a number of factors point to an overall conserved mechanism of fusion promotion among the new paramyxoviruses. fusion activity of the Hendra and Nipah F proteins is inversely proportional to the strength of the F attachment protein interactions. fusion activity for the Hendra and Nipah F proteins is inversely proportional to the strength of the F attachment protein interactions, in contrast to other paramyxovirus systems such as Newcastle disease viruses. EphrinB2 and B3 serve as ligands for the Eph tyrosine receptor family. their cellular expression in neurons, arterial endothelial cells, and smooth muscle is consistent with the tissue distribution observed during Hendra and Nipah infection. furin inhibitors or shRNA knock-downs of the cellular endosomal protease cathepsin L were shown to inhibit cleavage of the henipavirus F proteins. in vitro studies confirmed proteolytic cleavage of the henipavirus F proteins at a single specific site by purified cathepsin L. the henipavirus F proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transit through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (PM), and are then endocytosed. the cleaved protein is recycled to the plasma membrane. the identity of the HMPV F receptor remains to be defined. recent studies indicate that low pH can serve as a fusion trigger [17] for at least a portion of the HMPV strains [18] and specific residues that could promote low-pH-induced conformational change through an electrostatic repulsion mechanism have been identified."}
