{"summary": "the novel human CoV caused the first major pandemic of the new millennium in 2002\u20132003. it is thought that a bat CoV adapted to infect civet cats and in civet cats the virus further adapted, enabling it to infect humans. recently, a bat SARS-like CoV has been recovered from R. sinicus that can utilize human ACE2 as a receptor, underlining the ongoing threat of reemergence. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E can cause significant human respiratory disease in the elderly and infants, and mild upper respiratory infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. infection with the four different human CoVs typically takes place during childhood (Zhou et al., 2013). we review the genetic methods that are available to study viral contributions to disease, animal models that have been analysed for use as SARS-CoV infection models, and the viruses that are used in studying SARS-CoV biology and disease pathogenesis. the methods of evaluating viruses have changed and scientists are continually developing methods that allow us to rapidly evaluate viruses. the first targeted recombination system was developed for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) it used a temperature-sensitive trait to select and screen for template switching between the original temperature-sensitive virus and the new recombinant virus that lost the temperature-sensitive phenotype due to recombination. recombinant MHV that expressed the FIPV spike would only grow on feline cells, the non-recombinant MHV would not. complete reverse-genetics systems were developed in order to introduce mutants into genes 5\u2032 to the S gene. a systematic in vitro assembly of multiple cDNAs (most commonly seven) carried in separate plasmids. cDNA clone houses the genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) the BAC system can be designed with a cytomegalovirus promoter and can be transfected into cells to generate recombinant virus without in vitro transcription. the BAC system also can be designed with a cytomegalovirus promoter and can be transfected into cells to generate recombinant virus. the most widely studied strains, MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, primarily infect the brain or liver (MHV-A59) the brain is considered an immune-privileged site, thus cytokine/chemokine signalling and the cellular response will not be the same as in a less-privileged organ, such as the lung. other betacoronaviruses have been used to dissect the function of SARS-CoV genes in vitro and in viv the enzymic activity of the X domain is non-essential in HCoV-229E for replication in cell culture. the ADRP activity has been shown to be important for the development of liver disease during MHV-A59 infection. ns2 is a cyclic phosphodiesterase, similar to those functioning in tRNA metabolism. the MHV-JHM strain does not produce pulmonary disease, but rather has the CNS as the primary target of infection. nsp1 of SARS-CoV is different, by sequence, and is shorter than MHV nsp1. targeted recombination takes advantage of this natural event by introducing in vitro transcribed RNA into infected cells by electroporation and recombinant virus is then generated. it is possible for there to be multiple template-switching events, so it is important to consider the distance from the original template switch site. recombinant MHV that expressed the spike would only grow on feline cells, the non-recombinant MHV would not. resulting recombinant felinized virus expressing the spike was then used as an acceptor using transcripts of donor RNAs containing the original MHV spike. mutants that underwent template switching to the donor RNA would now express the MHV spike and can be selected by their ability grow on mouse cells. complete reverse-genetics ia vectors can be manipulated by well-established systems employing homologous recombination in vaccinia virus. the BAC system also can be designed with a cytomegalovirus promoter. it can be transfected into cells to generate recombinant virus without in vitro transcription. both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 are betacoronaviruses. the most widely studied strains, MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, primarily infect the brain (MHV-JHM and MHV-A59) the brain is considered an immune-privileged site. the X domain is a functional monophosphatase, called ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) ADRPs are important and ubiquitous cellular processing enzymes involved in the tRNA splicing pathway. ADRPs are conserved in coVs and in members of the \u2018alphavirus-like supergroup\u2019 of phylogenetically related positive-strand RNA viruses. ns2 greatly enhanced MHV replication in bone-marrow-derived macrophages. this suggests that it plays a similar role in Kupffer cells in the liver. ns2 is present in other MHV strains, suggesting that it plays a similar role in the liver. transcriptional profiles in human systemic inflammatory diseases were a poor mimic of the responses in human disease. responses were similar between humans and mice at 6\u201312 h. but overall recovery time for genes to return to baseline was drastically different in humans and mice. the ability of the animal model to actually mimic the disease in humans is required, but one must also consider the cost of experimentation and the ease of working with the animals. a more complete review of pathology can be found in van den Brand et al., 2014.

Strain V2163 was adapted to mice from SARS-CoV Urbani after 25 serial passages. this strain caused severe illness in mice aged 5\u20136 weeks. both strains contained a conserved mutation in the spike protein. mice treated with clodronate showed higher pro-inflammatory cytokines pre-infection. weight loss was similar in infected and uninfected treated mice by day 2 post-infection. but it is possible that the priming response may have affected mortality. a rat-adapted rat virus was developed by serially passaging the SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain. it was a mixture of the original virus without an ORF7a deletion and a variant virus that did have the ORF7a deletion. young rats had limited clinical symptoms, and lesions were limited to the bronchi, bronchioles and the alveoli. study evaluating the use of a live-attenuated vaccine used 7-week-old male hamsters vaccinated with a WT recombinant SARS-CoV Urbani or a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene. hamsters had no detectable virus in the nasal turbinates by day 5 post-infection or the lungs at any time post-infection. cyclophosphamide treatment led to weight loss, expanded tissue tropism of SARS-CoV, and increased pathology in lung, heart, kidney and nasal turbinates. cyclophosphamide causes lymphopenia, suppresses B-cell activity and activation, and suppresses regulatory T-cell function. outbred animals are less expensive and easier to handle than primates. ferret model has only studied animals in a single age range. the ferret model has only studied animals in a single age range. pulmonary consolidation in the lungs failed to develop lethal disease. the disease was characterized by multifocal mononuclear cell interstitial pneumonitis without diffuse alveolar damage (the hallmark of human infection with SARS-CoV), and severe hepatic and gastrointestinal inflammation (severe hepatic and gastrointestinal inflammation) cynomolgus macaques produced limited disease where symptoms presented 2 or 3 days post-infection and quickly resolved. study used cynomolgus macaques to evaluate pegylated IFN- treatment of SARS-CoV infection. animals treated with pegylated IFN- showed decreased viral titre in the lungs. the severity of diffuse alveolar damage was reduced by 80 %. disease was shorter in duration than human SARS, but it was lethal. pathological changes in MHV-1-infected A/J mice displayed multiple features observed in. patients, including interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, hyaline membrane formation, multinucleated syncytia, congestion, haemorrhage in the lung. in MHV-1-susceptible mice, IFN- and TNF- coproduction by CD8 T-cells is reduced in the lung compared with levels in B6 mice that do not develop lethal disease, but not in the spleen or lymphoid tissues. the MHV-1 model has several advantages as a model for studying the pathogenesis of coV-induced severe respiratory diseases. a targeted recombination system could be used to introduce some of the specific SARS-CoV genes into MHV-1 and study their effect on pathogenesis in this model. the model uses ACE2 and thus impacts a major signalling cascade that is not affected in the MHV-1 model.

ACE2 mice develop a lethal disease when infected with WT SARS-CoV. the development of severe encephalitis is not a feature of SARS in humans. Knockout mice have been used in evaluating the role of IFN in controlling CoV infection. adapted viruses are useful in dissecting host-function-specific genes. multiple passages in animals select for mutations that allow the virus to thrive in a specific environment. adapted viruses can mimic a SARS-CoV-like disease. both strains elicit expression of IL-12, IL-6, MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES. MA15 and V2163 stimulate low levels of IFN-, whereas IFN- is not induced in mice infected with SARS-CoV Urbani. rat-adapted mouse-adapted SARS-CoV was developed by serially passingaging the SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain. rat-adapted SARS-CoV was developed by serially passingaging the original virus without an ORF7a deletion. young rats had limited clinical symptoms, and lesions were limited to the bronchi, bronchioles and the alveoli, with only mild oedema around the blood vessels. study did not report if the adapted rat virus contained the ORF7a deletion as a majority or minority of the virus population. study evaluating the use of a live-attenuated vaccine used 7-week-old male hamsters vaccinated with a WT recombinant SARS-CoV Urbani or a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene. hamsters had no detectable virus in the nasal turbinates by day 5 post-infection or the lungs at any time post-infection. sphamide causes lymphopenia, suppresses B-cell activity and activation, and suppresses regulatory T-cell function. ferret cats are capable of being infected with SARS-CoV isolates recovered from humans and civets. outbred animals are less expensive and easier to handle than primates. the interstitial pneumonitis was less severe than that observed in human cases of SARS, with lesions similar to those seen in infected macaques. the pulmonary lesions resolved after day 35. rhesus and cynomolgus macaques produced limited disease. symptoms presented 2 or 3 days post-infection and quickly resolved. cynomolgus macaques did produce a disease similar to milder SARS-CoV infections. hyaline membrane formation, multinucleated syncytia, congestion, haemorrhage in the lung, pulmonary oedema and the presence of virus in the liver. a significant limitation of the macaque model is that lethal disease is only seen in older animals. MHV-1 infection induced a more robust and broader CD4 T-cell response in susceptible mice. resistant mice mounted a 'broad and vigorous' CD8 T-cell response. the MHV-1 model has several advantages as a model for studying the pathogenesis of coV-induced severe respiratory diseases. MHV-1 requires no Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) facilities, is a lower risk pathogen than SARS-CoV, naturally infects the lungs of mice and creates a lethal SARS-CoV-like disease in a specific mouse strain (A/J) primate models of disease are considered to accurately mimic human disease. small mammals are safer and less expensive to work with and house. but usually require host-adapted viruses to recapitulate human disease."}
