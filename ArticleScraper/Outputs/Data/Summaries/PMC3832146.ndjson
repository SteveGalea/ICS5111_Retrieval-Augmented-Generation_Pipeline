{"summary": "licorice is one of the oldest and most commonly used Chinese traditional medicines in China (1). licorice is widely used as flavoring additives in soft drinks, candies and other foods. there are about 30 species containing in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. soluble protein and peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity but also its germination had many different characters compared to the control ground group (11-12) soluble protein and peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity but also its germination had many different characters compared to the control ground group (11-12) the biocabin contained a self-regulating oxygen generator that used KO2 and LiOH. average radiation dose in the flight recovery module was 0.102 mGy day-1. the distance from flight apogee to earth was and the gravity was 106g. xylene was purchased from Yingdaxigui Chemical Industry (Tianjin, China) dexamethasone was purchased from Lisheng Medical Limited Company (Tianjin, China) the animals were housed in an environmentally (t = 25\u00b0C) and air humidity (60%) controlled room with a 12-h light-dark cycle. the cell phase was a linear gradient prepared from water (containing 1% acetic acid) (A) and acetonitrile (B) the composition of the gradient was A:B, 90:10 at 0 min, 84:16 at 10 min, 81:19 at 10 min, 81:19 at 10 min, 81:19 at 10 min, 40:60 at 97 min, 40:60 at 107 min and then the system was returned to initial conditions. group 1 animals (control) received the normal saline. group 2 animals were treated with dexamethasone (DEX, 10 mg/kg). group 6 to 8 animals received sample extract ACK (1, 2, 4 g/kg); group 9 to 11 animals received sample extract H (1, 2, 4 g/kg) successive administration were used for 5 days. at the fifth day, 30 min after the i.g. administration, the mice were received an IV injection of 1% Evan\u2019s blue solution (0.1 mL/10 g) to the tail. liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid in licorice root (n = 3) were two times higher than that of the ground control. glycyrrhizic acid in the group of ACK was two times higher than that of the ground control. ACK represents the ground control roots obtained from Ordos licorice seeds in Inner Mongolia. sample A and H represent the spaceflight group of ACK and HCK respectively. each value represents mean standard error of 3 replicates. the extract of licorice roots (0.5, 1, and 2 g/Kg) reduced the carrageenan-induced paw edema durably for 6 h. licorice extractions inhibited the acetic acid-induced extravasation of Evan\u2019s blue dye in mice approximately from 9.62% to 37.19% respectively. group n dose(g/Kg) Oedema index (%) 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h control 10 10 mL 66.23 3.34 57.99 5.34 43.80 5.38 36.96 5.80 30.87 3.32 DEX 10 0.01 44.62 2.10** 28.72 3.19** 24.27 1.75** 20.95 4.84** 10.71 2.99** ACK 10 0.5 67.55 1.88 57. .67 1.30**b A 10 2 58.33 2.12**b 52.78 1.20**b 38.33 1.41**b 26.48 1.68**b 23.08 0.85**a HCK 10 0.5 65.18 1.93 57.48 1.04 42.45 1.34 30.11 0.91* 25.22 1.12** HCK 10 1 64.22 1.09 55.20 1.56* 40.25 1.02* 25.56 0.67** 23.52 0.89** H spaceflight induced a higher percentage of cells with chromosomal aberrations. cytogenetic damage and hereditary mutation in plant seeds have been reported. liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid in licorice roots were higher in the spaceflight group than that of the ground control group. glycyrrhizate and sodium glycyrrhizate are capable of suppressing the formalin-induced edema in both intact and adrenalectomized animals. the effects of the former triterpenoids on the model of carrageenan-induced inflammation were less pronounced as compared to the hydrocortisone action. at this point, the comparison of anti-inflammatory activity between the spaceflight licorice and the ground control one was conducted through three kinds of inflammatory models."}
