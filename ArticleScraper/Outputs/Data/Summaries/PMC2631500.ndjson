{"summary": "human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated as a result of the immune response are likely to be the most effective therapeutic antibodies, particularly in cases of infectious diseases against which the immune response is protective. the available therapeutic armamentarium (e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals) is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains; therefore neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and the growing number of antibodies entering clinical trials are human [2] and are derived from phage-display technology [3] or from transgenic mice that express human immmunoglobulin genes. the best mAbs for clinical applications derive from natural human antibodies generated by the in vivo immune response because they are products of the human and not animal repertoire. we re-evaluated all the steps crucial to cell immortalization. we established an optimized procedure of isolating human mAbs from the repertoire of immune donors. HCMV is a ubiquitous opportunistic virus that infects 50\u201390% of adult human populations. the new process was compared to a method using CpG2006 and IL-2 in the presence of EBV [12] (COMBINED) and a method using EBV alone (BASIC) the results clearly demonstrated that activation of CD22+ B-lymphocytes before EBV exposure leads to improved immortalization. each population was compared for the total cell number (black bars) and for the number of viable cells (white bars) measured microscopically by trypan blue dye exclusion. results are representative of two independent experiments. the negative effects of the COMBINED method on viability are surprising, given that CpG2006 induces robust polyclonal activation and proliferation of B-lymphocytes [24,25] and that these effects are significantly enhanced by IL-2 [26] it is conceivable that the detrimental effects are related to the anti-proliferative activity of anti-viral cytokines induced by CpG2006. the results showed that CD23 expression is higher on cells exposed to the polyclonal activators and EBV separately than on those exposed simultaneously. the B-lymphocytes representing the whole repertoire of a selected donor immortalized with the SEQUENTIAL method show a significantly higher viability than those obtained with the COMBINED method. HCMV is also the leading viral cause of congenital infection associated to significant birth defects and neurological damage. HCMV is also the leading viral cause of congenital infection associated to significant birth defects and neurological damage for which no effective therapies are available before birth. a total of 1,664 clones were tested either by their binding to specific HCMV envelope glycoprotein domains. the effect on HCMV infectivity was determined by an HCMV microneutralization assay based on the ability of clone supernatants to interfere on the infectivity of HCMV AD169 strain. nine of these showed a neutralizing activity of > 40%. b. gB ELISA detects human IgG that bind to the AD-2 region of the HCMV envelope glycoprotein gB. c. Sera were tested in the HCMV microneutralization assay using the AD169 strain and HELF [48]. antibodies were tested using the HCMV microneutralization assay. results are expressed as % of inhibition of virus infectivity. none of the antibodies bound the HELF or HUVEC. the mechanism of virus neutralization is subject of ongoing studies. mAb 26A1 mAb was purified from serum-free supernatants by protein A chromatography. neutralizing activity of HCMV infectivity was then tested. neutralizing activity of mAb 26A1 encouraged us to generate recombinant IgG suitable as prophylactic or therapeutic tools in clinical applications. cells were submitted for 5' RACE PCR amplification, the PCR products of two amplification reactions were cloned using a Eco RI restriction site in a sequencing vector. a single VH and VL sequence was obtained from each cell culture, confirming that each original culture was clonal. screening can be performed using a variety of assays, including functional assays, iv) the mAbs of interest can be easily produced from the original clone as recombinant proteins suitable for clinical applications. the technology described has proven to be more reproducible, efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques. it can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory. CD22+/IgG+ lymphocytes were isolated by depletion of IgM+ cells with a MoFlo\u00ae High-Performance Cell Sorter (Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) then cultured (106/ml) in 24 well plates in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with L-glutamine, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin, the IgG+ lymphocytes were cultured (1.5 106/ml) for 4 days in complete medium containing CpG2006 (1 g/ml) and IL-2 (200 U/ml), then washed and maintained (1.5 106/ml) in complete medium. the number of viable lymphoblasts was measured microscopically by trypan blue dye exclusion. HCMV microneutralization assay was adapted from a previously reported technique [48]. HELF were plated onto flat-bottom wells of a 96-well plate in 100 l of minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. anti-HCMV recombinant gB IgG ELISA was purchased from Biotest, AG (Dreieich, Germany) and used according to manufacturer's instructions. the ELISA makes use of the recombinant autologous interstrain fusion antigen CG3 corresponding to a combination of the gB antigenic domain 2 (AD2) from HCMV strains AD169 (SwissProt Acc. No. P06473) and gB immunodominant region fused to GST that reacts with HCMV-positive sera. gH-GST corresponds to an in-frame fusion between the gH amino terminal region (amino acids 16\u2013144) from the strain VR1814 and GST. cDNA was produced by reverse transcription with an oligo(d)T primer. PCR reactions were set up to amplify VH and VL regions with a mix of IgG- and Igk/ specific primers. consensus sequence was determined from at least ten clones. a complete 26A1 recombinant vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO DG44 cells were adapted to serum-free suspension culture. 300 g of plasmid DNA was mixed with 900 g of linear 25 kDa PEI. IgM+ cells with a MoFlo\u00ae High-Performance Cell Sorter were cultured (106/ml) for 4 days in complete medium containing CpG2006 (1 g/ml) and IL-2 (200 U/ml) for 15 h, in the presence of irradiated, allogeneic PBMCs. the cells were then washed and cultured (1.5 106/ml) for 10 days in complete medium. the number of viable lymphoblasts was measured microscopically by trypan blue dye exclusion. the number of viable lymphoblasts was measured microscopically by trypan blue dye exclusion. cell viability was measured by direct immunofluorescence. a 96-well plate in 100 l of Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the plates were then centrifuged at 2,000 g for 30 min and incubated for 72 h. the effects of purified IgG on HCMV infectivity was measured by staining the IEA-positive nuclei. anti-HCMV recombinant gB IgG ELISA was used according to manufacturer's instructions. anti-HCMV recombinant gH-specific ELISA was performed using the recombinant gH-GST antigen CG3. gH-GST corresponds to an in-frame fusion between the gH amino terminal region (amino acids 16\u2013144) from the HCMV strain VR1814 and GST. the gH gene segment was PCR amplified from VR1814 DNA with the following primers. a consensus sequence was determined from at least ten clones. the resulting DNA sequences were aligned and translated into protein sequences enabling the generation of consensus DNA and protein sequence for VH 26A1 and VL 26A1. the resulting sequences were compared and aligned with sequences present in the genomeQuest, GeneSeq, and EBI databases. g of plasmid DNA was mixed with 900 g of linear 25 kDa PEI. the medium was harvested after 6 days. samples from CMV+ patients, AL Horenstein for help with antibody purification, and G Gerna for providing the HCMV VR1814 strain are acknowledged for helpful discussion and intellectual contributions. this work was funded, in part, by grants from Ribovax Biotechnologies SA."}
