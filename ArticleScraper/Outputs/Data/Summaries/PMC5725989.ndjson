{"summary": "the main antigenic determinants of IAV are the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) the main antigenic determinants of IAV are the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). avian IAVs (AIVs) have recurrently crossed species barriers thereby establishing new lineages. co-infection of pigs with avian, human and/or porcine IAV could lead to the emergence of new IAVs harbouring a novel constellation of the eight genome segments [7\u201310] these so-called reassortant viruses have a high zoonotic potential, as recently exemplified by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. bat IAVs lack the canonical receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities of conventional HA and NA, respectively. the identification of bat IAV expanded the host reservoir of IAV and immediately raised the question of their zoonotic potential. only recently, it became possible to reconstruct infectious bat IAV from synthetic DNA using reverse genetic approaches. bat IAVs exhibit the characteristic genome structure of conventional IAVs. they are composed of eight vRNA segments in anti-sense orientation including terminal NCRs. the highly conserved complementary promoter sequences at the extreme 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of each bat genome segment are almost identical to those found in conventional IAVs. gene reassortment was observed after co-infection with both HL17NL10- and HL18NL11-based bat chimeric viruses. reverse genetics rescue experiments using the eight genome segments resulted in a significant higher number of reassortment events. the failure of bat chimeric viruses to reassort with conventional IAV was partly due to an incompatibility between the internal proteins. bat IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was previously shown to share the dsRNA-binding property and IFN-suppression characteristics of conventional IAV NS1s. the combination of both incompatible packaging sequences and incompatible viral proteins has likely contributed to the failure to exchange genetic information between conventional and conventional IAVs. genome levels of wild-type (WT) H7N7 were set to 1. Column colours correspond to the amino acid substitutions in either the head or body domain. NP of bat IAV fully supported polymerase activity of conventional IAV of various subtypes. recombinant HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 could be successfully propagated in MDCK II but not in MDCK I cells. recombinant HL18NL11 and conventional IAVs are known to enter polarized epithelial cells via the basolateral site of the apical site of polarized epithelial cells. at least two human cell lines, SK-Mel-28 malignant melanoma cells, were found to be susceptible to infection with VSV-HL17 and VSV-HL18. recombinant bat IAVs were unable to infect cell lines from various bat species, including Sturnira lilium and Artibeus planirostris. bat IAVs enter polarized epithelial cells preferentially from the basolateral site via endocytosis upon binding of HL to a yet unknown receptor. the number of identical amino acids in different HA subtypes varies from 40 to 70 %, and within the same subtype from 80 to 100 %. HL proteins are cleaved by serine proteases such as trypsin or human TMPRSS2. only following proteolytic cleavage were HL proteins able to exhibit low pH-triggered membrane fusion activity. this feature is shared by bat and conventional IAVs and suggests that all of these viruses enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. HA proteins from avian IAVs preferentially bind to 2,3-linked sialic acids. HAs of human IAVs preferentially bind to sialic acids in 2,6-linkage. HAs of human IAVs have a preference for sialic acids in 2,6-linkage. recombinant bat IAV showed a similar cell tropism suggesting that HL17 and HL18 bind to the same or a very similar receptor. a previous study showed that treatment of susceptible cells with tunicamycin reduced infection with HL-pseudotyped VSV [57], suggesting that the unknown cellular receptor is a glycosylated protein. NA destroys receptor determinant of conventional IAV. removal of sialic acid residues prevents virus aggregation. a calcium-binding site is highly conserved in both NL10 and NL11. NL proteins may have a unique function distinct from the known sialidase activity of canonical NAs. the identification of two new influenza A-like viruses has expanded the number of potentially zoonotic IAVs. this raises important questions with respect to the origin and evolution of IAV."}
