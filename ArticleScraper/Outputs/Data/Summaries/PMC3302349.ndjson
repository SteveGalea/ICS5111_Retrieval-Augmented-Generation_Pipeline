{"summary": "genus Alphacoronavirus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it causes an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, and watery diarrhea in swine. since December 2010, outbreaks of viral diarrhea have been observed on most swine-breeding farms in most of the provinces of china. complete genome sequence of CH/FJND-3/2011 has 97.34% nucleotide sequence identity with that of CH/S. the S gene has the lowest sequence identity (93.75%) with that of CH/S. the alignment in the S1 region (nt 1 to 2217 of the S gene reveals two domains exhibiting increased divergence compared to the remaining part of the sequence. complete genome sequence of PEDV variant CH/FJND-3/2011 was deposited in GenBank under accession no. JQ282909."}
