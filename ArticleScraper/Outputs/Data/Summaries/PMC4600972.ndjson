{"summary": "RNF166 and its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF138, and RNF166 potentiates RNA virus-induced IFN- production. overexpression of RNF166 but not its homologous RNF114, 125, and 138, potentiated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN- promoter. 293T cells (2 106) were transfected with empty vector or expression plasmid of RNF166 (2 g), 24 h after transfection, the mRNA of ISG15 and MX1 were detected by Q-PCR. HEK293T cell pools with stable knockdown RNF166 were generated by shRNA. knockdown efficiency of RNF166 in HeLa cells was determined by RT-PCR. dsVACV-transfection(4 ug) induced production of IFN- by HeLa-shRNF166-#4 and #5 cells were lower than by HeLa-shGFP cells. knockdown of RNF125 slightly enhanced the SeV-elicited IFN- production. knockdown of RNF138 clearly enhanced the SeV-induced IFN- production. knockdown of RNF138 had no appreciable effect. 293T cells (2 105) were transfected with IFN- reporter (50 ng), pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (50 ng), expression plasmids for VISA or TBK1 together with an empty vector and RNF166 construct (50, 100, and 200 ng) 293T cells (2 105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids. 293T cells were transfected with flag-RNF166 plasmids (5 g each) the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) and analyzed by western blot (IB) with the indicated antibodies. overexpressed RNF166 localized predominantly in the cytosol as dots. double immunofluorescent staining showed that overexpressed TRAF6/3 had a similar distribution pattern. we did not detect co-localization between RNF166 and VISA. both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in seV-induced signaling in HEK293T cells. both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in seV-induced signaling. p-IRF3 was attenuated in TRAF3-knockout (KO) 293T, TRAF6-KO 293T, and VISA-KO 293T cells infected with SeV. lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-p-IRF3 antibody. overexpression of a RING deletion mutant (RNF166 RING) failed to enhance, but rather inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter induced by SeV and the overexpression of VISA. overexpression of RNF166 in HEK293T cells rendered them remarkably resistant to NDV infection and reduced levels of NDV-eGFP-positive cells. 293T cells (5 105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (1 g) at 12 h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV. at 24 h after infection, mRNA of P protein was determined by Q-PCR. overexpression of RNF166 enhanced the ubiquitination of overexpressed TRAF3/6. 293T cells (1 107) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (5 g each) cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibodies. ation of endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6 was notably inhibited when RNF166 expression was suppressed. but we did not find an apparent effect of knockdown of endogenous RNF166 on seV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. endogenous RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins RNF114 and RNF138 specifically enhances the seV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. cGAS and the STING-induced activation of the IFN- promoter suggest that RNF166 specifically enhances RNA but not DNA virus-induced IFN- production. overexpression of RNF166 can also enhance the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG15 and MX1. 293T-shRNF166-#4 and #5 cells were lower than by 293T-shGFP cells. HEK293T cell pools with stable knockdown of RNF114, RNF125, and RNF166 were generated using shRNA. knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR and Q-PCR. knockdown of RNF166 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter, transcription of IFN- mRNA, and secretion of IFN- triggered by SeV infection. we also generated stable RNF114-, RNF125-, and RNF138-knockdown HEK293T cell pools to determine their functions. overexpression of RNF166 potentiates VISA- but not TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter. 293T cells (2 105) were transfected with pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (50 ng), expression plasmids for VISA or TBK1 together with an empty vector and RNF166 construct (50, 100, and 200 ng) overexpressed RNF166 interacts with overexpressed VISA, TRAF3 and TRAF6. 293T cells (1 107) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (5 g each) cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA. se assays were performed as in (A) each graph represents the mean SD of three independent experiments done in triplicate. overexpressed RNF166 markedly associated with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in 293T cells, and also interacted with VISA. overexpressed RNF166 localized predominantly in the cytosol as dots. ISA-induced IFN- activation when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed. this data further supported the idea that RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6 to potentiate RNA virus-induced IFN- production. both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in seV-induced IFN- production in HEK293T cells. IRF3 dimer and p-IRF3 were attenuated in 293T-shTRAF3, 293T-shTRAF6 and 293T-shVISA cells infected with SeV. lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-p-IRF3 and anti-GADPH or by native western blot with anti-p-IRF3. functional domain mapping of RNF166 contains a RING domain, a zinc finger domain, and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UIM) to dissect the functional role of these domains, we generated three deletion mutants and assessed their ability to up-regulate seV-induced IFN- production in HEK293T cells. overexpression of a RING deletion mutant failed to enhance, but rather inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter induced by SeV truncations of RNF166 on SeV-induced (B) and VISA-mediated (C) activation of the IFN- promoter. 293T cells (5 105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (1 g) at 20 h after transfection, cells were infected with NDV-eGFP at an MOI of 0.0001, and at 40 h after infection, viral replication was determined by fluorescence microscopy. RNF166 enhances RNA virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. overexpressed RNF166 enhanced the ubiquitination of overexpressed TRAF3/6. 293T cells (1 107) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (5 g each) lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF3 (TRAF3) or anti-TRAF6 (TRAF6) antibody. the immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by western blot (IB) with the indicated antibody. ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and MDA5, leading to their degradation by the proteasome. but the functions of its homologous proteins RNF166 and RNF138 in innate immune signaling pathways remain elusive. a recent study has shown that TRAF3 is dispensable for the RNA virus-induced activation. TBK1 and IRF313, our data suggest that TRAF3 is critical for the seV-elicited production of IFN- in HEK293T cells. but we agree that TRAF6 is a critical component downstream of VISA13. RNF114 acts as a negative regulator of SeV-induced IFN- signaling. it is possible that RNF114 depends on A20 to play negative regulatory roles. further investigations are needed to confirm the function of RNF114.
