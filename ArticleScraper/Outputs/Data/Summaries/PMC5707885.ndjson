{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus,1 spread primarily through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos. the virus is endemic in parts of africa and Asia and has spread unabated through south America, Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2 years. a consensus sequence of ZIKV prM (precursor membrane and Envelope (Env) genes was generated using prM and Env sequences from various ZIKV isolated between the years of 1952 and 2015. the consensus sequence was cloned into the pVax1 vector after additional modifications and optimisations were made to improve its in vivo expression. lack of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of bnAbs to ZIKV-Env protein. consensus design strategy was adopted for the ZIKV-prME consensus sequence. the 293T cells were transfected with the ZIKV-prME plasmid. the cell lysates and supernatants were analysed for expression of the vaccine construct with pan-flavivirus (c) or Sera from ZIKV-prME immunized mice (d) splenocytes from ZIKV-prME immunised mice produced a cellular immune response after stimulation with multiple ZIKV-E peptide pools. peptide pool 15 showed the highest number of spot-forming units (SFU) this peptide was confirmed to contain a dominant prME epitope, \u2018IRCIGVSNR DFVEGM\u2019 (aa167-181). this peptide was confirmed to contain a H2-Db restricted epitope through analysis using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource tool (http://tools.iedb.org) splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides (5 M) or R10 only. splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides. the results illustrate that the T-cell responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non-consensus plasmid vaccines. both vaccines induced a significant cellular response against the dominant Env-specific CTL epitope. the consensus immunogen consistently induced more robust responses in these T-cell assays at the same dose. a commercial antibody (designated panflavivirus) that reacts to the Env protein of multiple flaviviruses specifically recognised rZIKV-E. western analysis showed that immune sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice specifically recognised rZIKV-E. this recombinant protein was used for further immunogenicity studies. antibody-induced antibodies were performed by screening pooled sera from immunised mice for its ability to detect rZIKV-E by western analysis. the results from both these analyses confirmed specificity of the vaccine-induced humoral responses. the vero cells infected with either ZIKV-MR766 or mock infected were stained with pooled sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (day 35) followed by an anti-mouse-AF488 secondary antibody for detection. the serum samples from the ZIKV-prME immunised mice were tested for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro. the PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing dengue virus, west Nile virus and other flaviviruses. ZIKV-prME vaccination yielded significant neutralisation response with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT50 dilution titres. the serum was collected from immunised mice at days 0, 14, 21, and 35. splenocytes from vaccine-immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response. the splenocytes from vaccine-immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response. ELISpot analysis of pre-immunisation and week 6 PBMCs ex vivo stimulated with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools showed that ZIKV-prME immunisation induced robust anti-ZIKV T cell responses in RM. PBMCs were isolated pre-immunisation and at week 6. PRNT50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50% of the input virus. specific anti-ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA. diluted RM-immune sera was added to monolayers of each cell type. the sera from ZIKA-prME vaccinated RM inhibited the ZIKV infection. two groups of mice (n=10) were immunised (25 g of vaccine) by the i.m. route. the immunisations were performed two times, two weeks apart, and all the animals were challenged on day 21 (1 week post second immunisation) at 3 weeks post challenge, 100% of all vaccinated animals survived. c,d) and clinical scores (e,f) for animals in (a and b) respectively are indicated. the designation for the clinical scores is as follows: 1: no disease, 2: decreased mobility; 3: hunched posture and decreased mobility. 5: paralysis of one hind limb; and 6: paralysis of both hind limbs. single immunisation with the synthetic ZIKA-prME vaccine provides protection against ZIKV challenge in mice lacking the type I interferon, receptor. mice were immunised once and challenged with 2106 plaque-forming units of ZIKV-PR209, two weeks post immunisation. pVax1 and prME vaccinated groups were collected 7\u20138 days after challenge. levels of ZIKV-RNA in the brain tissues were analysed at day 28 post infection. the results are indicated as the genome equivalent per millilitre of plasma. survival of mice lacking the type I interferon, receptor following passive transfer of anti-ZIKV immune sera following viral challenge ranged from 80 to 100%. survival of mice following administration of the NHP immune sera ranged from 80 to 100%. Optimal alignment of ZIKV-Env sequences was performed using homology models. reference models included PDB 5JHM and PDB 5IZ7. aligned residues corresponding to specific regions on the prME antigen were labelled in the models for visualisation purposes. a consensus design strategy was adopted for the ZIKV-prME consensus sequence. the optimised gene construct was inserted into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of a modified pVax1 vector under control of the CMV promoter. immunofluorescence assay (IFA) analysis for ZIKV-prME protein expression in 293T cells. the cells were transfected with 5 g of the ZIKV-prME plasmid. DAPI panels show control staining of cell nuclei. groups of four female C57BL/6 mice were immunised with either the control plasmid backbone (pVax1) or the ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine three times at 2 week intervals through intramuscular injection followed by electroporation at the site of delivery. bulk splenocytes harvested from each animal and evaluated in ELISpot assays for their ability to secrete interferon- (IFN-) after ex vivo exposure to splenocytes harvested 1 week after the third immunisation were incubated in the presence of one of the six peptide pools spanning the entire prM and Env proteins. the data represent the average number of SFU (spot-forming units) per million splenocytes with values representing the mean responses in each group.e.m. single function gates were set based on negative control (unstimulated) samples. the percentage of the total CD8+ T-cell responses are shown. results show that the ZIKV-prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine-specific T cells expressing TNF- (tumour necrosis factor-) and IFN-. the consensus immunogen consistently induced more robust responses in these T-cell assays at the same dose. however, there were no available commercial reagents to evaluate specific anti-ZIKV immune responses. by necessity, a recombinant ZIKV-Env protein (rZIKV-E) was generated to support the assays performed in this study. sera was obtained from each immunized mouse and tested by ELISA for ZIKV-specific IgG responses. a significant increase in anti-ZIKV-specific IgG levels was observed on day 21 with a further boost in the sera IgG levels noted on day 35. the C57BL/6 mice (n=4) were immunised i.m. three times with 25 g of ZIKV-prME plasmid or pVax1 at 2-week intervals. Binding to rZIKV-E was analysed with sera from animals at different time points (days 21, 35 and 60) post immunisation. PRNT50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50% of the input virus. control ZIKV-Cap (DNA vaccine expressing the ZIKV capsid protein) and pVax1 sera were used as negative controls. ution at which 50% of control ZIKV infection was inhibited was 4565. the PRNT50 of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated mice was 336. most strains of mice are resistant to ZIKV infection. most succumbing within 6\u20137 days post challenge. the PRNT50 titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1:60. by comparison, the PRNT50 titre for the day 35 samples was 1:60. the results indicate that IFNAR/ mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine are capable of generating anti-ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses. Rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally with 2 mg of ZIKV-prME plasmid. PBMCs were isolated pre-immunisation and at week 6. values represent mean responses in each group (n=5)s.e.m. specific anti-ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA. at week 6, rZIKV-E-specific binding antibodies were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV-prME. the neutralisation activity of antibodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluated by a PRNT50 assay. 5\u20136-week-old mice were challenged with 1106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the ZIKV-PR209 isolate, administered by either subcutaneous (s.c.); intraperitoneal (i.p.); intracranial (i.c.); or intravenous (i.v.) routes. after the challenge, all the animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection. received 1106 PFU of ZIKV-PR209 by the s.c. route. at 3 weeks post challenge, 100% of all vaccinated animals survived. only 30% of single- or 10% of double-dose challenged controls survived. group of 10 mice were immunised i.m. with either control plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine and challenged 2 weeks later with a total dose of 2106 PFU ZIKV-PR209. three weeks post challenge, 100% of the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals survived, while only 10% of the control animals survived. single immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine provides protection against ZIKV challenge in mice lacking the type I interferon, receptor. mice were immunised once and challenged with 2106 plaque-forming units of ZIKV-PR209, two weeks post immunisation. levels of ZIKV-RNA in the brain tissues were analysed at day 28 post infection. levels of ZIKV-RNA in the brain tissues were indicated as the genome equivalent per gram of tissue. pooled NHP anti-ZIKV immune sera was administered i.p. (150 l/mouse) to mice 1 day after s.c. challenge. as a control, normal monkey sera and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were administered (150 l/mouse) to age-matched mice as controls. prME through electroporation by the intradermal route uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i.m. electroporation. the consensus construct includes a designed change of the potential NXS/T motif, which removes a putative glycosylation site. IFNAR/ mice exhibited greater control of weight loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis. antibody-neutralising antibodies directed against the Env antigen are thought to have a key role in protection against disease and death in this model. five- to six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were housed and treated/vaccinated in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility. the animals were housed in adjoining individual primate cages allowing social interactions, under controlled conditions of humidity, temperature and light (12 h light/12 h dark cycles) s were determined by the alignment of current ZIKV prME protein sequences. the vaccine insert was genetically optimised (i.e., codon and RNA optimisation) for enhanced expression in humans and an IgE leader sequence was added to facilitate expression. five rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally at two sites two times at 4-week intervals with 2 mg ZIKV-prME vaccine. electroporation was delivered at 0.2 Amps immediately using the same device described for mouse immunisations. g or 1 g of ZIKV Env recombinant protein (rZIKV-E); transfected cell lysates or supernatant. the gels were run at 200 V for 50 min in MOPS buffer. membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. slides were washed in PBS for 5 min and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody. the slides were stained for nuclear structures using Harris haematoxylin. the sections were deparaffinised using two changes of xylene. slides were dehydrated with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol. spleens were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (R10) and then processed with a Stomacher 80 paddle blender. spleen samples were filtered through 45 mm nylon filters and centrifuged at 1,500g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. peptides for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2 in the presence of Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (brefeldin A and monensin; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) were used as a positive control and R10 media as the negative control. the cells were then stained for surface and intracellular proteins as described by manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 96-well ELISpot plates were coated with anti-mouse IFN- capture Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. after 24 h, the cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. with distilled water, dried at room temperature and SFU were quantified by an automated ELISpot reader (CTL Limited, Shaker Heights, OH, USA) the raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes. the reaction was stopped after 15 min with the addition of 1 N H2SO4. the optical density at 450 nm was read on a Synergy plate reader. all the mouse and RM serum samples were assayed in duplicate. medians and interquartile ranges at 50% neutralisation were calculated for each neutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group. the geometric mean titres were also calculated. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the primers ZIKV 835 and ZIKV 911c. a standard curve was generated in parallel for each plate and used for quantification of viral genome copy numbers. a Ct value 38 for at least one replicate was considered positive. strains MR766 (a kind gift from Dr Susan Weiss) and PR209 (Bioqual, MD) were amplified in vero cells. stocks were titred by standard plaque assay on vero cells. mice were housed and treated/vaccinated in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility. a consensus strategy was used and the consensus sequences were determined by the alignment of current ZIKV prME protein sequences. the vaccine insert was genetically optimised (i.e., codon and RNA optimisation) for enhanced expression in humans. the final construct is named ZIKV-prME vaccine and the control plasmid backbone is pVax1. rhesus macaques were immunised three times at 2-week intervals and killed 1 week after final immunisation. mice were immunised three times at 2-week intervals and killed 1 week after final immunisation. nuPAGE gels were loaded with 5 g or 1 g of ZIKV Env recombinant protein (rZIKV-E); transfected cell lysates or supernatant. the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot 2 gel transfer device (Life Technologies) the membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. slides were washed in PBS for 5 min and subsequently incubated with sera from immunised mice or RM at a 1:100 dilutions overnight at 4 \u00b0C. after washing, Flouroshield mounting media with DAPI (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was added to stain the nuclei of all cells. after which, coverslips were mounted and the slides were observed under a microscope. the slides were dehydrated with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol. the slides were cleared in xylene and mounted using Permount. spleens from mice were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640. the cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% FBS) before surface staining with flourochrome-conjugated antibodies. the cells were then stained for surface and intracellular proteins as described by manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 96-well ELISpot plates were coated with anti-mouse IFN- capture Ab. plates were washed with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBST+1% BSA. after 24 h, cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature. raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes.
