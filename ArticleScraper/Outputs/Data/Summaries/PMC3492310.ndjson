{"summary": "major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes are essential for the immune defence against pathogens from intracellular (e.g. viruses) and extracellular (e.g. helminths) origins. serosurvey studies in Namibian cheetahs revealed higher exposure to viral pathogens in individuals from north-central than east-central regions. two selection scenarios are currently debated to explain susceptibility or resistance to parasite infections. one scenario relies on the resistance effects of specific MHC alleles selected frequency-dependent in space and time. the other scenario is based on the assumption that two MHC molecules with different binding properties present different subsets and thus a higher variety of antigens. free-ranging cheetahs on Namibian farmland potentially come into close proximity with domestic and feral dogs and cats that are sometimes unvaccinated. serosurveys of common feline and canine viruses such as feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline parvovirus (FPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) confirmed the exposure of free 3.0% (P0.0001), 3.0% (P0.0001), 4.5% (P = 0.0012) and 3.0% (P = 0.059) of the cheetahs were seropositive for these viruses [21]. there is no genetic differentiation at evolutionarily neutral microsatellite markers among cheetahs throughout Namibia [22] indicating that this is a panmictic population. heterozygote or divergent allele advantage hypothesis predicts a higher heterozygosity and higher genetic distance at MHC I loci in cheetahs from north-central than east-central Namibia due to an increased exposure to viruses in north-central Namibia. the higher selection pressure in this region might also lead to a higher allelic diversity. exon 2 encoding the functionally important antigen-binding sites (ABS), i.e. amino acid positions postulated to interact directly with the foreign antigens [27], [28]. we previously determined the locus-specific assignment of MHC alleles in A. jubatus [24]. equilibrium was met at locus C of MHC II DRB but it deviated significantly (P = 0.0004) across loci B and D of MHC I, resulting in a deficit of heterozygotes. locus D remained at H-W equilibrium (P = 0.30) 88 62 21 62 26 67 21 Haplotype frequencies Acju-MHCI*04/Acju-MHCI*05 0,51 0,58 0,35 0,49 0,6 Acju-MHCI*02/Acju-MHCI*05 0,38 0,32 0,52 0,39 0,33 Acju-MHCI*02/Acju-MHCI*07 0,07 0,06 0,1 0,07 0,05 Acju-MHCI*04/Acju-MHCI*07 0,05 0,05 ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns ns n hs from the north-central region were highly differentiated from those of the east-central region based on the haplotype frequencies across MHC I loci (FST = 0.07, p0.01) the differentiation remained significant even after re-assigning north-central individuals trapped close to the region borders to the east-central region (FST = 0.03, p = 0.03) the expected heterozygosity was slightly higher in males (mean HE = 0.360.20) than in females (mean HE = 0.310.25) at the MHC II-DRB locus, the observed heterozygosity was significantly higher in males (Hobs = 0.63) than in females (Hobs = 0.38, 2 = 3.94, p0.05) but no deviation from H-W equilibrium was detected. the substitution is outside the functionally important antigen-binding sites. we identified seven and three genotypes for the six and four expressed alleles at the MHC I and II-DRB loci.

HC I alleles/haplotypes were selected in a frequency-dependent manner according to their functional importance by either negative frequency dependent selection, rare-allele advantage [6], [7] or fluctuating selection [8], [9]. i.e. spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the abundance of pathogens could well cause significant differences in allele and haplotype frequencies across populations. the higher seroprevalences to viral pathogens observed in north-central than in east-central Namibia was attributed to the higher human density there. contrasting distribution of genetic variation between MHC I and MHC II-DRB loci suggests that intracellular-derived pathogens exert a stronger selection pressure than extracellular-derived pathogens in cheetahs across Namibia. a lack of genetic differentiation at the microsatellites indicates that free-ranging Namibian cheetahs represent a large panmictic population. the patterns of genetic differentiation at adaptive MHC I and neutral microsatellites differed markedly in the Namibian cheetah population. conservation plans based solely on neutral genetic variation are not guaranteed to preserve adaptive genetic variation because both sources of genetic variation are not always positively correlated. the Namibian cheetah population represents a large panmictic population as revealed by neutral microsatellite markers. translocations should be carefully planned as wrongly chosen origin of or destination area for translocated animals may adversely affect their ability to cope with different pathogenic selection pressures. further research should focus on MHC composition in relation to pathogen load in cheetahs from different African populations. samples were transported in a dry shipper in full compliance with the Convention on international trade in endangered Species (CITES) to Germany and stored at 80\u00b0C until further processing at the laboratory. 88 samples were genotyped for MHC I and II-DRB loci. nucleotide sequences were edited manually based on their forward and reverse consensus chromatograms using Chromas Pro version 1.33 (Technelysium Pty Ltd) the sequences were aligned and coding regions were translated into deduced amino acid sequences using Clustal W as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [40] the ratio of males and females was similar in the north-central (N males = 18, N females = 8) and the east-central region (N males = 49, N females = 13, 2 = 0.97, df = 1, p = 0.33) the prediction of different allele and haplotype frequencies between regions was tested by using F-statistics. study site and sample collection used blood samples from 88 wild-born cheetahs from east-central and north-central Namibia. these animals included free-ranging individuals inhabiting commercial livestock or game farmland in Namibia (N = 49), wild-caught individuals kept in a large holding facility (N = 28) and dead individuals reported to us or found in the field (N = 11). HC I alleles was amplified using primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_cF (5\u2032-GCTCCCACTCCCTGAGGTAT-3\u2032; [23]) and the newly designed primer Acju_Ex2MhcI_kR (5\u2032-GGAKTCGCTCTGTGTAGT-3\u2032) designed from MHC I transcript sequences available from felid species in GenBank. PCR conditions described in Castro-Prieto et al. (2011). estimated as number of individual occurrences of a certain allele divided by its total count observed in the population. Expected heterozygosity (HE) was estimated as a general indicator of the amount of genetic variation in the population. differences in heterozygosity between north-central and east-central Namibian cheetahs were tested with chi-square test."}
