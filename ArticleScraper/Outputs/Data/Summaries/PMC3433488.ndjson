{"summary": "51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost HALYs, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. most burdensome infectious agents were hepatitis C virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhino the Ontario Burden of Infectious Disease Study (ONBOIDS) was conducted to provide a detailed comparison of a wide range of infectious diseases. the study used routinely collected health information from the province of Ontario and did not require informed consent from participants. incidence data are compiled from various sources to estimate the future burden associated with incident cases of disease over a one-year period. we included 51 infectious agents causing disease associated with one or more of the following characteristics: 1) severe morbidity/mortality; 2) high incidence; 3) historically relevant (i.e., legally reportable to public health authorities in Ontario); and 4) of emerging interest (e.g., new prevention program, extensive media attention). each infectious disease had one or more health states. for example, the health states for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were HIV, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and terminal AIDS. to calculate YERF, we multiplied the age- and sex-specific number of incident cases of each associated health state. the GBD methodology discounts future life years at a rate of 3%. future life years are assigned less value than those lived today. there is no consensus on the appropriate discount rate. data were collected from validated linked population-based databases. data on physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were abstracted from the Canadian Institute of Health Information's Discharge Abstract and Same-Day Surgery databases. ella cases experienced the following health states: gastroenteritis \u2013 mild (did not seek medical care), gastroenteritis \u2013 moderate (saw a physician), gastroenteritis \u2013 severe (hospitalized), and septicaemia. the same denominator (i.e., adjusted number of cases) was used for all health states, but we assumed that individuals who had severe gastroenteritis had a prior episode of moderate gastroenteritis (i.e., saw a physician) i.e., cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anal canal, penis, and oropharynx. we estimated the incidence of anogenital warts from an epidemiologic study. those who died experienced 2.25 years in remission (five years minus the time spent in palliative (five months) and terminal care (one month) divided by two = 4.5 years/2 = 2.25 years) fifth, we assumed the reduction in functioning to be similar when in remission. we did not consider recurrent cancers. the institute of clinical evaluative sciences is named as a prescribed entity under section 45 of the Personal Health Information Protection Act (Ontario Regulation 329/04, Section 18). under this designation, ICES can receive and use health information without consent for purposes of analysis and compiling statistical information about the health care system of Ontario. the HALY is a composite measure of the gap between ideal and actual health that incorporates both mortality and morbidity. the HALY includes both death occurring before a pre-specified maximum life expectancy and years of healthy life lost due to suboptimal states of health associated with disease. each infectious disease had one or more health states. the GBD methodology uses a standard life expectancy table (Coale and Demeny West level 26 model life table) [14] when calculating YLL. with the GBD methodology, disability weights are generated by expert opinion. we derived severity weights for health conditions using the classification and measurement system of functional health methodology. we adjusted for under-diagnosis and under-reporting using estimates from comparable populations. for diseases where reported cases do not reflect incident cases due to delays from time of infection to symptomatic presentation, diagnosis, and reporting, we used mathematical models to generate more accurate estimates of disease incidence and resulting health states. to estimate disease burden, we extracted reported cases of salmonellosis from iPHIS and applied a multiplier of 13 to adjust for under-diagnosis and under-reporting. to estimate disease incidence, we extracted reported cases of salmonellosis from iPHIS and applied a multiplier of 13 to adjust for under-diagnosis and under-reporting. a simplified assumption was that all cases of AIDS would reach the terminal phase of AIDS, although some individuals with AIDS may die from other causes before the terminal phase. we extracted HIV-coded deaths from vital statistics data to determine the number of deaths due to HIV. relative survival estimates and treatment distributions were determined from epidemiologic studies and expert opinion. we simplified treatment options by not distinguishing between curative and palliative radiation therapy and not considering chemotherapy associated with mild, moderate, and severe toxicity. we assumed that only deaths that occurred within five years were attributable to the cancer. sensitivity

denotes the change in rank of an infectious disease/pathogen from its rank using the ONBOIDS methodology. most of the burden was from premature mortality rather than morbidity, observed a number of sex-specific differences. 29 HALYs per 100,000 population is close to one-quarter of the 3017 HALYs per 100,000 population estimated for all cancers combined in a Canadian study using similar methodology. one caveat for this comparison is that the burden of HPV-related cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma were included in both studies. the differences may be due to a combination of biological and behavioural risk factors. the syndrome-based results can guide prioritization of \u2018horizontal\u2019 prevention methods that are independent of the causative pathogen (e.g., smoking cessation and hand hygiene as methods of preventing pneumonia) ONBOIDS is the most comprehensive examination of infectious diseases to our knowledge. but the study was not exhaustive. we excluded certain pathogens (e.g., norovirus), syndromes (e.g., surgical site infections) and health states (e.g., amputations due to serious infection) the WHO GBD project has had significant impacts on global and regional agencies. but a provincial analysis such as ONBOIDS provides information closer to the level of government responsible for healthcare policy-setting and funding. decision-makers must appreciate the \u201cherd-dynamic\u201d aspects of infectious diseases, such that funding for highly successful vaccination programs is not diverted towards the high-impact diseases identified here.
