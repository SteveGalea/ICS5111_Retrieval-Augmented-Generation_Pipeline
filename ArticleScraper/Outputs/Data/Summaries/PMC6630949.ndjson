{"summary": "influenza viruses C (isolated in pigs and humans) and D (isolated from cattle) are less common. influenza viruses A (infecting avian and mammals including human) and B (almost exclusively infecting humans and seals) account for the annual global burden of influenza [3,4] substitution in HA1 created a novel N-glycosylation site that allowed an antigenic variant of an H3N2 to escape neutralization by a monoclonal antibody. altering glycosylation patterns is one of the means used by viruses that results in potential cause of vaccine failure. this mechanism is reliant on the ability of the eight genomic fragments of influenza viruses to reassort with genomes of other influenza viral subtypes or strains. re-assortant viruses that comprise of the LAIV can grow at 32\u201333 \u00b0C, the temperature range of cells lining the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, when administered intranasally. the most spelt-out advantage is the \u201cnon-invasive\u201d capacity of the attenuated viruses and this had made it suitable to use for all categories of vaccines. both the LAIV and IIV are cocktails of circulating seasonal influenza viruses. mainly three viruses, i.e., A (H1N1) pdm09, A (H3N2), and the pre-determined dominant influenza B lineage are the constituents of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) the CDC advocates the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in all persons >6 months prior to the winter. in some parts of the world, mostly Africa and Asia, there are either limited or no established influenza vaccination policies. however, in some parts of the world, mostly Africa and Asia, there are either limited or no established influenza vaccination policies. a typical influenza VLP has the HA, NA, and the matrix protein 1 (M1). a typical influenza VLP has the HA, NA, and the matrix protein 1 (M1). a typical influenza VLP has the HA, NA, and the matrix protein 1. rapid advances and need for a new vaccine platform are generating some promising data for influenza VLPs. to overcome challenges raised by rapid influenza evolution Gao et al. attempted to generate VLPs with HBV backbone containing matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) together with the epitope of highly conserved nucleoprotein (NP) LPs that carry a computationally designed HA have been developed. clade 2 highly pathogenic A (H5) involved in human infections. a similar approach also demonstrated protection of cynomolgus macaques. paved way for the generation of single-cycle replicating influenza viruses as vaccine candidates. paved way for the generation of single-cycle replicating influenza viruses as vaccine candidates. main reasons synthetic influenza vaccines remain promising is due to their ability to alter viral immunomodulatory traits and their amenability to rapid production. gen-presenting cell (APC) inducible Vaccines Recent studies have shown that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induced an expansion of anti-influenza virus cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and T helper 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells. grafting the alpha-Gal epitope onto HA promoted its opsonization thereby enhancing the uptake of the vaccine virus by APCs. a double-layered protein nanoparticle developed using tandem expressed M2e (comprising human, avian, swine, and domestic fowl) showed homosubtypic and heterosubtypic protection in mice that were immunized prior to challenge with specific influenza A viruses. a similar approach by Chahal et al. also demonstrated the induction of both CD8+ and antibody responses in the lungs of pigs. an adenovirus vectored influenza virus vaccine has shown a strong induction of influenza virus-specific humoral and cell-mediated responses leading to the phase II clinical trial. adenovirus vectored influenza virus vaccine has also shown a strong induction of influenza virus HA-stalk cross-reactive antibodies in mice. this provides an avenue for scaling up appropriate doses for later use in seasonal vaccine development efforts. lack of data suggesting antiviral efficacy against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI), i.e., H5N1 remains an important issue in areas with possible spillover events from avian into humans [88]. Nitazoxanide is a licensed anthelminthic drug that has been repurposed to ameliorate influenza due to its broad range of protection efficiency against influenza viruses in a phase II b/III clinical trial. the antiviral, JNJ-63623872 (Pimodivir) is non-nucleoside influenza virus PB2 inhibitor, which binds a conserved domain on the polymerase subunit, PB2 of influenza A viruses. the anti-influenza virus drug T-705 was shown to have a selective index over 2000 for influenza viruses, with no detectable cytotoxicity in vitro. the mechanism of action of the drug has been attributed to the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by the active phosphoribosylated T-705. RNA genomes such as arena-and bunya-viruses or positive-strand RNA such as noro- and flavi-viruses have been exploited. no known resistance has been reported, except for a purposeful mutation that conferred resistance to a laboratory H1N1pdm09 virus strain. the drug has been approved and marketed in the us as Xofluxa. phase III trial of the Arbidol in ongoing in china and the drug is also due phase IV trial in Russia. as of 2017, ingavirin has been approved for the treatment of influenza. mABs that can cross-neutralize multiple viral subtypes could lead to novel passive immunotherapy treatments for human infections. mABs that can cross-neutralize multiple viral subtypes could also have the potential to abrogate spillover infection events from zoonotic species.

Nitazoxanide is a licensed anthelminthic drug that has been repurposed to ameliorate influenza due to its broad range of protection efficiency. a pre-approval trial (of Pimodivir) for the treatment of patients with influenza virus A (H7N9) infection has been allowed. a pre-approval trial (of Pimodivir) for the treatment of patients with influenza virus A (H7N9) infection. the mechanism of action of the drug has been attributed to the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by the active phosphoribosylated T-705. the drug acts a nucleotide analogue and, hence terminating viral replication. this has warranted further experiments on many other RNA viruses possessing either negative-strand segmented RNA genomes. limiting drug had previously been licensed for use in both China and Russia for almost several decades. it was found to potently inhibit influenza virus fusion with susceptible cell membranes, followed by interferon induction. drug is also due phase IV trial (with an unknown status) in Russia. the feasibility of immunotherapy for rapidly evolving influenza was attained upon the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibody C179 isolated from a mouse immunized with H2N2 antigen [127,128]. further characterization showed the binding of C179 to the stem of HA, thus providing a structural basis to its ability to inhibit fusion. mABs that can cross-neutralize multiple viral subtypes could lead to novel passive immunotherapy treatments for human infections. some examples of antibodies with the highest potential for use in management of influenza are listed in Table 3. studies by El Bakkouri et al. used an immune serum of mice to show Fc-dependent immunity against the M2e [139]. intranasal administration of monoclonal anti-NA antibody resulted in total protection (in mice) with significantly lower virus titers and no viral escapes. antibody-based immuno-prophylaxis and -therapeutics have more prospects in effective intermediation of influenza outbreaks and production of specific influenza vaccines. it is worth noting the diverse protective mechanisms by which antibodies exert their functions directly on pathogens or on pathogen-infected cells. virus neutralization, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cell lysis (ADCL) are well- ADCL is another mechanism that could increase the killing of influenza viruses. we emphasize the therapeutic capacity of novel monoclonal antibodies in combating influenza infection. passive immunization will culminate in an accelerated relief through any of the mechanisms previously described."}
