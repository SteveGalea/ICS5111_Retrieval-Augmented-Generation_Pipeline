{"summary": "alveolar epithelium is comprised of two morphologically different cell types. TII cells are cuboidal epithelial cells with diameters of 10 m. TII cells can produce cytokines and chemokines in response to lung injury. TI cells comprise 95% of the alveolar epithelium, making them a major component of the physical barrier to pathogens. new data led us to reconsider the current thoughts surrounding the role of TI cells in alveolar inflammation. TI cells contain toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall protein found on gram negative bacteria. ELISA found that TI cells produce more cytokines per cell after LPS treatment than TII cells. but this effect was magnified by the fact that TI cells produced relatively small amounts of TNF-, IL-6 or IL-1 in response to LPS. this is contrary to previously published reports. all animals were housed and provided ad libitum access to food and water. rats were anesthetized by brief inhalation of 4% isoflurane prior to intratracheal instillation of normal saline (control) or LPS 10 mg/kg. the animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia. cell preparations containing >2% of contaminating cells were discarded. cell purity was determined via immunocytochemical staining of samples using RTI40 to label TI cells and RTII70 to label TII cells. cells were resuspended in DMEM-H16 containing 20% fetal bovine serum. cells were then cultured on glass slides at a density of 500,000 cells/well. cells were then cultured overnight in a 10%CO2/air incubator at 37\u00b0C. cells were cultured for 18 hours prior to collection of supernatant and cells. total RNA were mixed with genomic DNA elimination buffer prior to synthesis of cDNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Valencia, CA) the resulting cDNA reaction was mixed with SYBR green qPCR master mix and transferred into the 96-well RT2 Profiler PCR Array for Rat Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors (SABiosciences) immunohistochemistry was performed on cytocentrifuged preparations of mixed rat lung cells. antibodies used were phospho-IKK/ (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), RTI40 and RTII70. control slides were mounted with a non-specific IgG primary antibody. dawley rats were euthanized by instilling 3 ml of 10 mM PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. the procedure was repeated with another 3 ml three times. the BAL was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes to remove cells and cellular debris. all animals were housed and provided ad libitum access to food and water. rats were anesthetized by brief inhalation of 4% isoflurane. animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia. cell preparations containing >2% of contaminating cells were discarded. non-FACS isolation of alveolar TI and TII cells discarded. cell purity determined by cell-specific staining with appropriate antibodies to TII cells and DAPI. alveolar TI and TII cells were isolated by FACS using methods described by Gonzalez et al [15] after enzymatic digestion with porcine grade IV elastase (Sigma) the lungs were minced to produce a single cell suspension that was then subjected to FACS using alveolar epithelial cell antibodies that are specific, within the lung, to the apical membranes rat TI (RTI40) [16] or rat TI TI cells were resuspended in DMEM-H16 containing 20% fetal bovine serum. cells were then cultured in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. cells were then collected, counted, and resuspended in DMEM-H16. macrophages were added to cultured TI or TII cells. similar numbers of macrophages were cultured alone as a control. RT2 Profiler PCR Array and Quantitative PCR were mixed. significance was assessed by an unpaired Student's t-test, with a p value of 0.05 considered statistically significant. Western blot analysis After instillation of LPS or saline vehicle into the lungs of rats, TI and TII cells were isolated via FACS 18 hours later. antibodies used were CCR5, SPP1 and -actin (Sigma) antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (Invitrogen) all slides were mounted with a non-specific IgG primary antibody. images were captured with a leica DC500 camera on a leica Orthoplan microscope. unpaired Student's t-test was conducted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. a p value of 0.05 was considered significant. TI cells from control uninjured rats showed a statistically significant higher level of expression of multiple genes (43 of 84 genes assayed) only three genes exhibited >2-fold increase that was statistically significant. in TI cells, only five genes \u2013 CCL19, CRP, IL13, IL18 and LTA (lymphotoxin alpha or TNF-) were significantly up-regulated in TI and TII cells compared to controls. IL10ra, interleukin 10 receptor alpha, is considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine [21] for each gene studied, both control and LPS-treated TI cells exhibited greater-fold expression than control or LPS-treated TI cells. the relative expression levels in LPS-treated TI cells were significantly greater than in control TI cells. western blots from TI and TII cells of control and LPS-injured (LPS 10 mg/kg) rats were probed with antibodies against CCR5 and SPP1. -actin staining shows equalization of protein loading. our qPCR data validated the finding of high levels of SPP1 in TI cells. TI cells contain more SPP1 than their TII cell counterparts. injured TI cells had significantly more SPP1 protein than injured TII. cultured TI cells produce more TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 than cultured TII cells. both TI and TII cells were isolated from rats via FACS. at baseline, cultured TI cells produced slightly more TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 than their TII cells. TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 production in TI and TII cells was significantly increased over baseline for TI cells. levels of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated TII cells were significantly greater than in control TI cells. IL-6 secretion via ELISA as the overall level of IL-1 production for both cell types was low. TII cells isolated in the conventional manner showed much higher levels of TNF- and IL-6 (406.384.5 pg/ml) than TII cells isolated by FACS (TNF- 59.019.8 pg/ml; IL-6 56.216.5 pg/ml) the white arrow points to the lone TI cell in the field. the white arrow points to the lone TI cell in the field. the corresponding phase contrast image is 20. co-cultured TII cells with 0%\u201320% macrophages. we treated the cells with LPS prior to measuring supernatant cytokine expression. increased IL-6 production over LPS-stimulated TII cells alone. cytokine expression in TI cells co-cultured with progressively higher concentrations of macrophages significantly increased TNF- and IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with LPS (10 g/ml) results are expressed as mean level of cytokine in pg/ml SEM, *p0.05. addition of macrophages to TI cells resulted in an increase in cytokine production after treatment with LPS. macrophages produce more cytokines per cell than TI cells in response to LPS. conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages increased baseline cytokine expression. but not nearly to levels seen after LPS addition to co-cultured TI cells. media, however, blunted the degree of TI cell IL-6 production (337.031.2 pg/ml) when compared to LPS-treated TI cell IL-6 expression. conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages did not increase TII cell cytokine production over LPS treatment alone. the addition of conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TI cells to cultured macrophages did increase TNF- (4956.7654.1 conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TI cells increased both TNF- and IL-6 expression compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. results are expressed as mean level of cytokine in pg/ml SEM. exogenous surfactant decreases cytokine production in both TI and TI cells. the addition of exogenous rat surfactant (5 or 10 g/ml) to TII cells did not alter cytokine production in response to LPS. surfactant significantly decreased LPS-induced IL-6 production in TI cells by 43% with 5 g/ml surfactant (n = 4). phospho-IKK/ staining was present in cultured TI cells as early as 10 minutes after LPS stimulation. similar staining was seen in TI and TI cells. NF-B expression is elevated in both TI and TI cells after LPS stimulation.

IL10ra, interleukin 10 receptor alpha, is considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine. for each gene studied, both control and LPS-treated TI cells exhibited greater-fold expression than control or LPS-treated TI cells that was statistically significant. IL10ra and CCL21 were the most differentially expressed genes of all assayed. Western blots of cell lysates from TI and TII cells of control and LPS-injured (LPS 10 mg/kg) rats were probed with antibodies against CCR5 and SPP1. both differences are statistically significant. our qPCR data validated the finding of high levels of SPP1 in TI cells.

IL-6 levels from stimulated co-cultures of TII cells and 20% macrophages were significantly reduced over levels for stimulated macrophages alone. cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages and alveolar epitheli was significantly reduced. cytokine expression in TI cells co-cultured with progressively higher concentrations of macrophages significantly increased TNF- and IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with LPS (10 g/ml) results are expressed as mean level of cytokine in pg/ml SEM, *p0.05. addition of macrophages to TI cells resulted in an increase in cytokine production after treatment with LPS. macrophages produce more cytokines per cell than TI cells in response to LPS. conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages increased baseline cytokine expression. but not nearly to the levels seen after LPS addition to co-cultured TI cells. conditioned media from LPS-stimulated macrophages did not increase TI cell cytokine production over TI cells stimulated with LPS. the addition of conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TI cells to cultured macrophages did increase TNF- (4956.7654.1 pg/ml) and IL-6 (446.313.8 pg/ml) levels above those seen with the addition of LPS to macrophages (10% Macs) conditioned media from LPS-stimulated TI cells increased TNF- and IL-6 expression compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. results are expressed as mean level of cytokine in pg/ml SEM. exogenous surfactant increases cytokine production in both TI and TI cells. the addition of exogenous rat surfactant (5 or 10 g/ml) to TII cells did not alter cytokine production in response to LPS. surfactant significantly decreased LPS-induced IL-6 production in TI cells by 43% with 5 g/ml surfactant (n = 4) and 35% with 10 g/ml surfactant (n = 3). phospho-IKK/ staining was present in cultured TI cells as early as 10 minutes after LPS stimulation. similar staining was seen in TI cells. similar staining was seen in TI cells. the alveolar epithelium has a number of very important functions, primary among them gas exchange and existence as a tight barrier to separate organism from environment. TI cells cover approximately 5% of the internal surface area of the lung, while TI cells cover the remaining 95% [8], prompting the question of whether TI cells could participate in the innate immune response. TI cells are capable of producing TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 when exposed to LPS [9], advocating a role for TI cells in the innate immune response in the lung. a large number of inflammatory mediators more highly expressed in TI cells compared to TII cells at baseline. studies have shown that TNF- production from freshly isolated rat alveolar epithelial cells can decrease dramatically, from 1200 pg/ml immediately after isolation to 50 pg/ml 48 hours later. these products of inflammation undoubtedly affect cytokine expression in both TI and TII cells. d TII cells produced significantly lower levels of selected cytokines than previously published reports for TII cells exposed to identical amounts of LPS for the same periods of time. d TII cells were able to produce significantly more cytokines than TII cells both at baseline and upon LPS treatment. d TII cells produced significantly lower levels of selected cytokines than TII cells. the bulk of the measured cytokines seen with LPS treatment of TII cells comes from the contaminating cells within the TII cell preparation. this concern of cell contamination contributing to the overall cytokine response of TII cells has been expressed by other investigators. es and TI cells are a much more potent factor in modulating cytokine release. conditioned media from activated macrophages decreased levels of IL-6 compared to LPS-stimulated TI cells alone. IL-6 conditioned media experiments reinforce the notion that cell-cell interaction between TI cells and macrophages is powerful. surfactant decreased cytokine production in LPS-treated TI cells. the NF-B pathway is important in stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and activating genes that regulate the inflammatory response in multiple different organs, tissue and cells. cytokine expression in alveolar epithelial cells may play an active role in the innate immune response of the lung. despite the differences in study design and methods, the final message culled from both of our reports is largely the same. TI and TII cells respond differently to LPS stimulation. elucidating the role of TI and TII cells in the innate immune response could help develop new therapies and treatment options."}
