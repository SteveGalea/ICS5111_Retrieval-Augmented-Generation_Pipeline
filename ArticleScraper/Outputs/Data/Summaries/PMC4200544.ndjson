{"summary": "PCT and CRP were simultaneously measured and compared in 73 medico-surgical ICU patients according to the American College of Chest Physicians. the diagnostic accuracy of PCT was higher (75%) with greater specificity (72%), sensitivity (76%), positive and negative predictive values (89% and 50%), positive likelihood ratio (2.75) and the smaller negative likelihood ratio (0.33) \"severe sepsis\" or \"septic shock\" have been proposed by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference in 1992. the clinical parameters include Fever (>38\u00b0 C) or hypothermia (36\u00b0 C), increased heart rate (>90 beats/min), tachypnea (>20 breaths/min) and altered white blood cell count (>12,000 cells/mm3 or 4000 cells/mm3) calcitonin is only produced in the C cells of the thyroid gland as a result of hormonal stimulus. a patient should be considered at risk of developing severe sepsis or septic shock. study was carried out at the Apollo Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, receiving patients from affluent to low-middle socioeconomic status emerging from the entire country. 73 cases were finally included in this study. study subjects were grouped according to their clinical, laboratory and bacteriological findings. patients were split into four groups and studied till recovery. patients without SIRS were included into the \u2018no SIRS\u2019 group. serum PCT and CRP concentrations in the clinically diagnosed groups of the study subjects showed highly significant difference. the mean serum PCT and CRP concentrations in cases with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were significantly higher from that of the cases with SIRS and no SIRS (P 0.01). microbiological culture results reveal 53.42% accuracy with higher specificity than CRP. DISCUSSION PCT was first described as a marker of the extent and course of systemic inflammatory response to bacterial and fungal infections in 1993. plasma levels of PCT and CRP in patients with and without infection at different levels of SIRS were assessed. patients with moderate to severe sepsis had higher PCT concentrations than patients with no/local infections (P 0.01). sensitivity of CRP in the diagnosis of sepsis was found to be higher (85.45%) than PCT (76.36%). sensitivity of CRP in the diagnosis of sepsis was found to be higher (85.45%) than PCT (76.36%)."}
