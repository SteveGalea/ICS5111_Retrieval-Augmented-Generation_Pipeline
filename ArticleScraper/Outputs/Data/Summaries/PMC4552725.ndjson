{"summary": "asymptomatic colonization can establish and progress to pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis. it is estimated that S. pneumoniae causes over 1 million infant deaths every year worldwide. serotypes 3, 6B, 9N and others vary markedly in their ability to cause invasive infection. studies in mouse models of primary pneumococcal pneumonia showed that PLY-deficient strains are more rapidly cleared from the lungs and induce less inflammation compared to isogenic toxin-producing bacteria [18\u201320]. Interestingly, PLY exists in at least 16 different protein variants with variable haemolytic activity. NLRP3 inflammasome senses S. pneumoniae expressing haemolytic PLY in human lung tissue. pneumococcal serotypes 1 and 8 expressing non-haemolytic toxins are poor inflammasome activators. human lung tissue Lung tissue samples were obtained from 33 patients primarily suffering from bronchial carcinoma, which underwent lung resection at local thoracic surgeries. written informed consent was approved by all patients and the study was approved by the ethic committee at the Charit\u00e9 clinic. the highest amount of pneumococcal lysate used were generated from 5x106 CFU S. pneumoniae. Western blot Proteins from human lung tissue were extracted using lysis buffer. anti-IL-1beta, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-NLRP3 antibodies were used. samples were tested for a normal distribution with the D\u2019Agostino and Pearson Omnibus Normality Test. samples that were not normally distributed were analysed with Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test. PBMCs were purified from buffy coats by gradient centrifugation. cells were infected with 1 x 106 (MOI = 1) or 1 x 104 (MOI = 0.01) CFU/mL S. pneumoniae or treated with 10 M Z-YVAD (Merck Millipore), allele 1 or allele 5 PLY (0.25, 0.5, 1 g/ml) cellular fraction of human blood was PBS-washed, diluted in PBS (2%) and incubated with pneumococcal lysates for 1 h at room temperature. highest amount of pneumococcal lysate used were generated from 5x106 CFU S. pneumoniae. sequence reads were assembled using SPades [38] and contigs were ordered by r2cat [39] using S. pneumoniae D39 genome as reference genome. draft genome sequence reads will be used for further comparative genomic analysis. IL-1 but not IL-8 secretion was strongly reduced by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD. PBMCs were infected with S. pneumoniae strains (MOI = 1). production of IL-1 (A, D, H) and IL-8 (C, E, J) was quantified by ELISA after 16 h. PBMCs were infected with serotypes 3, 6B, 7F, 9N, 1 and 8 pneumococci. serotypes 3, 6B and 9N induced red blood cell lysis. serotypes 1 and 8 expressing a non-haemolytic PLY exhibited no haemolytic activities. all tested bacteria induced the transcriptional regulation of Il1b mRNA. also stimulated production of the inflammasome-independent chemokine IL-8. cell death induced by S. pneumoniae D39 was dependent on PLY. the production of IL-1 in human lung tissue is dependent on PLY and caspase-1. both strains induced expression of Il1b mRNA and proIL-1 protein. production of IL-1 in human lung tissue is dependent on PLY and caspase-1. haemolytic (serotypes 3, 6B, 9N) and non-haemolytic (serotypes 1, 8) pneumococcal strains infected human lung tissue. haemolytic allele 1 PLY stimulated a much stronger IL-1 production in human lungs compared to non-haemolytic allele 5 toxin. NLRP3 expression is up-regulated in human lung tissue during S. pneumoniae infection. human lung tissue was infected with 1x106 CFU/mL S. pneumoniae serotype 2 D39 or D39ply for 16 h. IL-1 in human lungs is also dependent on PLY and caspase-1. both strains induced expression of Il1b mRNA and proIL-1 protein. production of IL-1 in human lung tissue is dependent on PLY and inflammasomes. haemolytic allele 1 PLY stimulated a much stronger IL-1 production in human lungs compared to non-haemolytic allele 5 toxin. the serotype 1 and 8 bacteria expressing a non-haemolytic PLY appear to evade recognition by inflammasomes, and therefore induce little IL-1 production. NLRP3 inhibitor glybenclamide effectively reduced IL-1 secretion in human lung tissue during pneumoniae infection. human lung tissue was infected with 1x106 CFU/mL S. pneumoniae D39 for 16 h. the MLST306 serotype 1 clone has emerged as responsible for over 80% of serotype 1 diseases in many parts of the world. it has emerged as being responsible for over 80% of serotype 1 diseases in many parts of the world. the expression of a non-haemolytic PLY might make serotype 1 bacteria less damaging and harmful for the host. but not all serotype 1 pneumococci carry the non-haemolytic PLY. serotype 1 pneumococci appear to be weak inducers of Il1b mRNA. other PLY-independent characteristics of this strain influence the interaction with the host s innate immune system."}
