{"summary": "forecasting of epidemic peaks and final sizes could help support real-time decision-making. results The 2015\u20132016 influenza season was mild and late-peaking. results The 2015\u20132016 influenza season was mild and late-peaking. the Alberta (ProvLab Alberta) and Ontario (Public Health Ontario Laboratories [PHOL] perform testing on 25000\u201350000 influenza specimens in a given season. PHOL tests approximately 55% of unique respiratory virus specimens in the province of Ontario. the onset of influenza season was defined as 2 consecutive weeks in which the number of cases was greater than zero and greater than the number of cases reported in the prior week. the end of influenza season was defined as 2 weeks in a row with zero cases. PHOL tests 55% of unique respiratory virus specimens in the province of Ontario. QE2 testing is limited to hospital testing and testing related to outbreaks in long-term care facilities. model describes epidemic processes in terms of exponential growth and simultaneous decay. the end of influenza season was defined as 2 weeks in a row with zero cases. onset of influenza season was defined as 2 weeks in a row with zero cases. model was fit to incident case data to predict epidemic peaks, end dates, and final sizes. 0 estimates were associated with jurisdictions with the largest case counts (Alberta and Ontario, with R0 values of approximately 1.4) higher R0 values were associated with higher d values (Table 1). the best-fit R0 estimates are similar to those often estimated for influenza [16]. parameter estimates, summed provincial case counts were stable by early february (approximately 24 generations) no sudden surges in either estimated R0 or d throughout the duration of the outbreak. -axis are the dates of most recent influenza data used for model fitting. the solid black line represents projected size; dashed black lines represent upper- and lower-bound 95% confidence intervals (CIs) Alberta and Ontario laboratories reported most cases (42.7% and 50.8% of total cases) influenza activity in this season started much later than most previous influenza seasons, especially in Nova Scotia, where the season started in late December 2015. in Analyses Population and Generation Time R0 d Alberta cases only, 3-day generation time 1.372 (1.345\u20131.402) 0.0048 (0.0043\u20130.0052) Nova Scotia cases only, 3-day generation time 1.372 (1.347\u20131.399) 0.0047 (0.0043\u20130.0051) Ottawa cases only, 3-day generation time 1.229 (1.184\u20131.278) 0.0045 (0.0033\u20130.00456) Ottawa cases only, 3-day generation time 1.162 (1.139\u20131.1 the dates on the x-axis represent the date of most recent influenza data used for model fitting. forecasting final size and Epidemic Peak Projections were generated using best-fit parameter estimates. final size projections were fairly stable from mid-February 2016 onwards. peak date estimates appeared to stabilize, projecting a peak in mid-February, around early January 2016. peak estimates for Alberta and Ontario did not stabilize until after peaks had occurred. the post-peak estimate for Ontario was 1 month earlier than the true peak. only 3 of 13 models correctly forecast influenza season onset, 1 of 13 correctly forecasts the season\u2019s peak, and 3 of 13 forecast epidemic size to within 1%. the model generated timely and fairly accurate estimates of influenza season size and duration. the parameters generated by the model seemed reasonable. the small number of cases reported from these areas was associated with low estimates of R0. the smaller the sample size of the jurisdiction under analysis, the less stable, reliable, and timely projections appeared to be. a possible reason for this overestimation relates to our \u201cseeding\u201d our models by assuming a single case at \u201ctime zero\u201d. this project focused on the ability to forecast influenza epidemics in real time. but better understanding of factors influencing model performance will likely also need to include historical data from well characterized influenza seasons."}
