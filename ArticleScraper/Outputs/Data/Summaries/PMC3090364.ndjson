{"summary": "the 'One Health' concept states that there should be a seamless interaction between veterinary and human medicine. such interactions may take place at many levels - from management of zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks in the field to joint research programmes to integrated policy making and funding decisions. the concept of one health is nothing new. one health concept is often attributed to Claude Bourgelat, founder of the first veterinary school in Lyon in 1761. it was perhaps in the 20th century that the medical and veterinary professions became slightly distant, a fact that was recognized by Calvin Schwabe (1927-2006) who promoted a're-unification' from the 1960s. a number of organizations have endorsed the One Health concept. many of the best examples of such infections are viral, where virus mutation or re-assortment permits extension of the target host range. the role of parasitic diseases in one health has also been discussed. in 2006, there were 72 million pet dogs in the USA (in 37% of households) and 81 million pet cats (in 32% of households) estimates for 2010 in the UK are for 8 million pet dogs (in 23% of households) and 8 million pet cats (in 19% of households) zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis caused by leishmania infantum (L. chagasi) is endemic in many countries across southern Europe, the Americas, northern Africa and Asia. the disease is endemic in many countries throughout southern Europe, the Americas, northern Africa and Asia. pet travel has been responsible for establishment of reservoirs of leishmania-infected dogs in these non-endemic areas. the number of pet animals entering or re-entering the UK alone was 717, 965. the focus of attention for international pet travel has been rabies vaccination. global pet travel creates the potential for rapid dissemination of zoonotic infection. the major species infecting man and companion animals are Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (in North America) and B. garinii and B. afzelii (in Europe) [19]. the major canine pathogen of these taxa is the tick-transmitted B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. a range of other bartonella species are also reported from cats and dogs. a number of ehrlichial and rickettsial infections are shared by man and companion animals. the spotted fever group of rickettsiosis are also significant problems for man and dogs. the role of the dog in these human infections is again in transporting infected ticks into the domestic environment. the role of the dog in these human infections is again in transporting infected ticks into the domestic environment and the risk to owners of removing infected ticks from their pets. ined-up' research programmes that investigate the agents, their vectors and epidemiology, geographical distribution, clinical significance and pathogenesis. identifying diseases for which domestic pet animals are true reservoirs of human infection (e.g. leishmaniosis) and formulating public health strategies that effectively control the disease in the reservoir. studies of spontaneously arising disease in relatively outbred and long-lived animals must provide information of benefit to human medicine. the availability of the canine and feline genomes [29,30] and the development of microarray genomic screening tools [31,32] provide us unprecedented ability to explore the basis of canine and feline diseases that so closely mimic those that occur in man."}
