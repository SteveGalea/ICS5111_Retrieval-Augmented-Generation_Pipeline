{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) has spread to 30 states. it was estimated the disease has killed more than 10 percent of pigs. the source of the virus in the united states is not known. in suckling pigs, mortality generally reaches 50 to 80 percent, but declines to 1 to 3 percent in grower pigs. in china, vaccination was widely used in the swine industry. in late 2010 china began experiencing an epidemic that was attributed to newer strains of PEDv that could circumvent immunity developed from current vaccines. swine companies provided data for all of their production sites in a 14-county area in 4 contiguous states, a total of 242 sites. the three participating companies did not account for all swine production sites in the 14-county area. data analysis Data tabulations and an epidemic curve were created using Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae 2010. tabulations for PEDv-positive sites were combined with PEDv-positive placed sites. Weekly PEDv incidence was calculated by dividing the number of new cases in a given week by the number of uninfected sites (population at risk) at the beginning of the week. the linear directional-mean function in ArcGIS and the direction method in clusterSeer were used to describe the direction of disease spread during the outbreak. all PEDv cases (including positive-placed sites) were included in the analysis to determine the direction of disease spread. clusterSeer provides the following results: a significance test for the above hypothesis, the average direction of disease spread, and a measure of the variance in the angles between connected cases. the positive-placed sites were excluded from analysis, and the linear directional mean methodology was repeated to ascertain if the direction of disease spread changed. all data received or linked with the original data are subject to the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002, Public Law 107\u2013347, December 17, 2002. the data providers and the authors have signed a legal agreement so that the data is protected to the extent permitted by federal law and regulation. the resulting weekly ellipses show the distribution and orientation of PEDv cases on a weekly scale. directions of disease spread was analyzed and qualitatively compared with the wind data. two methods were used to describe the direction of disease spread during the outbreak. the null hypothesis is that cases following a given case are located in a random direction. the alternative hypothesis is that subsequent cases are located in a specific direction. 222 sites were included in the analysis. production type Number positive sites Total Percent sites PEDv positive Finisher 48 126 38.1 Nursery 4 45 8.9 Sow 32 40 80.0 Other or unknown type 6 11 54.5 Total 90 222 40.5 Fig 2. Epidemic curve for a Spring 2013 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) outbreak. the circular variance from the linear directional-mean analysis was large (0.81), however, indicating that the daily PEDv vectors used as inputs deviated from the directional mean output. the gray squares show locations of sites that remained negative for PEDv; each square measures 5 by 5 miles. the outbreak at these sites occurred in late spring 2013 and lasted 31 days. one of the companies had a lower site-level PEDv incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two (47.2 and 41.1 percent) of the positive sites, there were 4 positive placed premises. the core cluster measured about 33 miles in the north-south direction and 41 miles in the west-east direction. a slight northwest to southeast orientation appears in the third week due to an outlying positive in the southeastern extent of the outbreak. the blue circles are earlier dates in the outbreak, and the red circles are later dates in the outbreak. squares with a darker gray color have more negative sites in the area. the direction of disease spread correlated qualitatively with wind direction. however, the results should be interpreted cautiously because our analysis has a number of limitations. wind can generate complex air movement patterns due to changes throughout the day and week. this analysis considers the predominant wind direction. it is possible that strong gusts of wind occurred in other directions. this analysis considers the predominant wind direction. research is also needed to evaluate whether PEDv on or in flies can infect pigs and, if so, whether the flies are biological or mechanical vectors."}
