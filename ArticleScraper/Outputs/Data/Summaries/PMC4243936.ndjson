{"summary": "HMPV-infected cells were stained with antibodies that recognised the HMPV fusion protein (F protein), attachment protein (G protein) and matrix protein (M protein), and fluorescent probes that detect GM1 within lipid-raft membranes (CTX-B-AF488) and F-actin (Phalloidin-FITC) lipid-raft membrane domains and F-actin structures are present at the site of the virus morphogenesis. the filamentous virus-like particles that form in cells expressing the G protein formed in cellular structures containing GM1 and F-actin suggest the G protein contains intrinsic targeting signals."}
