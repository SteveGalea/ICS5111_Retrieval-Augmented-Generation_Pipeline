{"summary": "coVs are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from approximately 27 to 32 kb. their genomes contain 7 to 14 open reading frames (ORFs) and ORF1a and ORF1b encode two polyproteins. innate immune responses are activated through host pattern recognition receptors. retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) can be sensed by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) (11\u201313) many viruses have acquired mechanisms to circumvent these host immune responses. reemerging coV PEDV 3CLpro nsp5 disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving a critical signaling protein, NEMO. reemerging coV PEDV 3CLpro nsp5 disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving a critical signaling protein, NEMO. a new mechanism acquired by PEDV to disarm host innate immune responses. the luciferase reporter plasmids IFN--Luc, IRF3-Luc, and NF-B-Luc contained four copies of the IRF- or NF-B-binding motif of the porcine IFN- promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. cDNA expression constructs encoding human MAVS, MDA5, RIG-I, NEMO, a constitutively activated form of NEMO ( the abundance of individual mRNA transcript in each sample was assayed three times and normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. the abundance of individual mRNA transcript in each sample was assayed three times and normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and P values of 0.01 were considered highly statistically significant. hek-293T cells or PK-15 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with various plasmids. PEDV strain AJ1102 was isolated from a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea in 2011. luciferase reporter plasmids IFN--Luc, IRF3-Luc, and NF-B-Luc have been described previously (17, 24) cDNA expression constructs encoding human MAVS, MDA5, RIG-I, NEMO, a constitutively activated form of NEMO (NEMO-K277A), and porc RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase. abundance of individual mRNA transcript in each sample was assayed three times and normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA) the data represent relative firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and are representative of three independently conducted experiments. PEDV nsp5 inhibited SEV-induced IFN- synthesis in transfected HEK-293T cells. we constructed an expression vector encoding the nsp5 of PEDV. we determined the impact of its ectopic expression on SEV-induced IFN-synthesis. HEK-293T cells or PK-15 cells cultured in 48-well plates were transfected with IFN--Luc plasmid (0.1 g) and pRL-TK plasmid (0.01 g, for normalization of transfection efficiency) twenty-four hours after the initial transfection, the cells were further infected or mock infected with SEV. mutation at either residue eliminated the capacity of PEDV nsp5 to catalyze a precursor of PEDV nsp5, nsp4-5. nsp5-H41A and nsp5-C144A were incapable of suppressing a SEV-induced IFN- promoter. nsp5 depends on its protease activity to antagonize IFN- production. human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV OC43), MHV, NP_068668.2; SARS-CoV, NP_828850.1. red arrows indicate conserved enzymatic proteolysis residues. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged PEDV nsp5 and Flag-tagged PEDV nsp5 precursors (nsp4-5) PEDV nsp5 inhibits IG-I/MDA5 signaling upstream of TBK1. TBK-1-induced IFN- promoter activation was not affected by PEDV nsp5. PEDV nsp5 disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. nsp5 may target signaling component(s) of the IFN-inducing pathway(s) for cleavage. we therefore investigated if RIG-I, MAVS, NEMO, and MDA5 serve as substrates for PEDV nsp5. however, no cleavage products were observed for MAVS, RIG-I, or MDA5. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a flag-tagged human NEMO expression plasmid (4 g) and an empty vector or plasmid encoding PEDV nsp5 (2 g) cells were prepared 30 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage was not affected by Q218A, Q236A/Q239A, or Q259A mutations. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage was not affected by Q218A, Q236A, or Q259A mutations. or Q231A substitution (Leu-Ala-Gln229-Leu-Gln231-Val-Ala-Tyr) blocked the appearance of the cleavage product as well as the reduction in abundance of full-length NEMO. a mutation of the FMDV capsid precursor may also affect 3Cpro-mediated capsid precursor cleavage. PEDV nsp5-induced NEMO cleavage fragments lose the ability to induce type I IFN-. we used a constitutively active NEMO mutant, NEMO-K277A, to examine the effect of PEDV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage on IFN- induction. PEDV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage is involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a constitutively activated form of NEMO (NEMO-K277A) or its mutants as indicated (4 g), along with PEDV nsp5 (2 g) HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid. plasmid encoding putative PEDV nsp5-induced cleavage fragments of NEMO-K277A. nsp5 cleaves NEMO by means of its protease activity. nsp5 mutants cleave ectopically coexpressed Flag-NEMO-K277A. NEMO is a proteolytic substrate for PEDV nsp5. this result is consistent with the inability of these nsp5 mutants to cleave NEMO. PEDV nsp5 inhibits IFN- promoter activation in HEK-293T cells. nsp5 is a new CoV-encoded IFN antagonist. nsp5 inhibits IFN- promoter activation in PK-15 cells. HEK-293T cells or PK-15 cells cultured in 48-well plates were transfected with IFN--Luc plasmid (0.1 g) and pRL-TK plasmid (0.01 g, for normalization of transfection efficiency) twenty-four hours after the initial transfection, the cells were further infected or mock infected with SEV. a mutation at either residue (Ala for His41 [H41A] or Ala for Cys144 [C144A]) eliminated the capacity of PEDV nsp5 to catalyze a precursor of PEDV nsp5, nsp4-5. however, PEDV nsp5-H41A and nsp5-C144A were incapable of suppressing a SEV-induced IFN- promoter. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged PEDV nsp5 and Flag-tagged PEDV nsp5 precursors (nsp4-5) the cells were further infected with the indicated HA-tagged PEDV nsp5 and PEDV nsp5 expression plasmid. PEDV nsp5 disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling and cleaves NEMO. overexpression of RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS significantly activated the IFN- promoter. however, TBK-1-induced IFN- promoter activation was not affected by PEDV nsp5. the protease activity was critical for PEDV nsp5-mediated inhibition of the IFN response. we therefore investigated if RIG-I, MAVS, NEMO, and MDA5 serve as substrates for PEDV nsp5. nsp5 inhibits signaling upstream of TBK1. HEK-293T cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with a flag-tagged human NEMO expression plasmid (4 g) cell lysates were prepared 30 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. PK-15 cells were transfected with a flag-tagged human NEMO or porcine NEMO expression plasmid (6 g) along with an empty vector or plasmid encoding PEDV nsp5 NEMO is reduced in PEDV-infected cells. compared with uninfected cells, NEMO protein abundance was substantially reduced. nsp5 cleaves NEMO at glutamine 231. NEMO cleavage was not affected by Q218A, Q236A/Q239A or Q259A mutations. either Q229A or Q231A substitution (Leu-Ala-Gln229-Leu-Gln231-Val-Ala-Tyr) blocked the appearance of the cleavage product as well as the reduction in abundance of full-length NEMO. HEK-293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged WT NEMO or NEMO mutants as indicated, along with PEDV nsp5. PEDV nsp5-induced NEMO cleavage fragments lose ability to induce type I IFN. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a constitutively activated form of NEMO (NEMO-K277A) or its mutants as indicated (4 g), along with PEDV nsp5 (2 g) HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids, pRL-TK plasmid, and Flag-tagged NEMO-K277A expression plasmid. HEK-293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid. plasmid encoding flag-fused NEMO-K277A cleavage fragments of NEMO-K277A. plasmid encoding NEMO-WT, NEMO-Q231A, NEMO-K277A/K277A expression vector. nsp5 mutants cleave ectopically coexpressed Flag-NEMO-K277A. NEMO is a proteolytic substrate for PEDV nsp5. NEMO is a proteolytic substrate for PEDV nsp5. at least eight proteins encoded by SARS-CoV have been identified as IFN antagonists. nsp1, papain-like protease (PLP), nsp7, nsp15, N, M, ORF3b, and ORF6 have been identified as IFN antagonists. PEDV nsp5 adopts a new mechanism from other known CoV-encoded IFN antagonists. NEMO is also a substrate shared by PEDV nsp5, a 3CLpro. the residues KLAQLQ231VA (P6 to P2\u2032; numbering is based on NEMO) occupy, and define, the subsites S6 to S2\u2032 of PEDV. the orientation of the long side chain P3 residues (Arg, Lys, or Asp) is in accordance with that of Glu165. the interaction suggests that a mutation of the P3 position with a relatively short side chain, such as Ala, is potentially harmful for nsp5-substrate binding. this idea is strongly supported by the observation that the ability of PEDV nsp5 to cleave the NEMO mutant Q229A is significantly impaired. NEMO-Q229, NEMO-Q229A, NEMO-Q229K, or NEMO-Q229R) and Glu165 in PEDV nsp5 are indicated above the sequence. nsp5-mediated proteolytic cleavage of NEMO directly involved in inhibition of IFN- transcription."}
