{"summary": "influenza is one of the few diseases that is truly global in scale. it is responsible for approximately three to five million cases of severe acute respiratory illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year. vaccination remains one of the most powerful ways of combating influenza, but choosing a representative strain for vaccine composition poses a challenging problem. northern and southern temperate climates have alternating seasonal influenza epidemics. each year, northern and southern temperate climates have alternating seasonal influenza epidemics. a possible mechanism of viral spread could involve transmission from the seasonal peak of one temperate zone into the season ebb of the other. seasonal H1N1 may show cross-immunity from H3N2's [18], [19]. the antigenically different pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009 has largely overtaken previously circulating H1N1 and H2N2 [22]. a second shortcoming stems from biases in the number of sequences from different regions and different seasons. the 2003\u20132004 flu season was marked by failure to predict the dominant, tropically-derived Fujian/411/2002-like H3N2 strain. we identified a strong seeding pattern from the tropics to all three climate zones. to accomplish this goal, we defined each virus's most likely ancestor to have the highest sequence similarity among all older viruses. the number of seeding events from the north was less than expected, and from the tropics and the south more than expected. the most significant was transmission from the tropics into the northern temperate zone. clustering H3N2 NA also revealed a similar pattern of circulation beginning in the tropics. clustering the complete H3N2 and H1N1 coding sequences for HA and NA allowed the determination of multiple statistically significant seeding seasons between 1988 and 2009. results for H3N2 showed that the overwhelming majority of statistically significant seeding seasons came from the tropics, confirming previous findings. global network of statistically significant seeding seasons for H3N2 after clustering by (A) continent and (B) country. global network of statistically significant seeding seasons for H3N2 after clustering by (A) continent and (B) country. HA dataset for H1N1 contained no sequences from Hong Kong and only 1 (0.091%) China sequence. NA contained 9 (0.69%) Hong Kong and 3 (0.23%) China sequences. clustering H1N1 NA by climate zone supported theory of global viral spread from the tropics. the global seeding network of H3N2 by country facilitated differentiation of isolates by Hamming distance. a necessary consequence of expanding geographic coverage was an increase in non-unique solutions (Text S1) the tropics and the northern temperate zone (Figure S4A) transmit and receive the most seeding events to and from the rest of the world. the tropics and the northern temperate zone (Figure S4A), specifically Asia and North America (Figure 6A), transmit and receive the most seeding events to and from the rest of the world. betweenness measures the number of shortest paths in a network passing through a given node. in this analysis, we differentiated between internal (self-seeding) and external (seeding between nodes) transmission events in temperate countries since their flu seasons are discrete. countries were also ranked by calculating the proportion of nodes in a 1,000 randomized networks with a greater, or lesser, degree flow (Text S1). countries were also ranked by calculating the proportion of nodes in a 1,000 randomized networks with a greater, or lesser, degree flow (Text S1). as for continental clustering, Asia was the only terminal source. the tropics consistently scored highest by seeding outdegree, positive degree flow, and PageRank source. the tropics consistently scored highest by seeding outdegree, positive degree flow, and PageRank source. however, the tropics possessed a large amount of internal seeding events. results for H3N2 showed that the overwhelming majority of statistically significant seeding seasons came from the tropics. for HA, Asia was the primary seeder of Asia, North America, and Oceania. prominent transmission from North America to Europe and South America was also observed. clustering by country showed tropic-centric movement patterns. arrowheads signify the direction of the seeding event. each edge is color-coded according to weight: the number of events represented. H1N1 analysis by continent and country was inconclusive due to low (typically fewer than 3 seeding events), homogeneous counts. the fact that a tropical signal could be detected at all from such few tropical countries, including Hong Kong and China, suggests that H1N1 adopts a similar seeding pattern out of the tropics. HA1 data produced a highly detailed global network of influenza variants. USA, Hong Kong, Australia, and china were identified as the four most prominent seeding countries in that order. both China and Hong Kong serve as a launching pad for dispersal of new seasonal variants to the rest of the world. the tropics and the northern temperate zone (Figure S4A) transmit and receive the most seeding events to and from the rest of the world. the tropics and the northern temperate zone (Figure S4A), specifically Asia and North America (Figure S5A), transmit and receive the most seeding events. the more numerous internal events in the tropics and Asia indicate a high level of circulation between tropical countries and between Asian countries. the small proportion of internal events for countries supports the notion that local persistence often plays only a minor role in influenza transmission. the northern temperate zone was the most important waypoint source and sink. the tropics consistently scored highest by seeding outdegree, positive degree flow, and PageRank source. the tropics consistently scored highest by seeding outdegree, positive degree flow, and PageRank source. clustering by country revealed USA, Japan, and Australia as sites in the influenza network vulnerable to disruption. HA1 analysis produced more detailed picture: each year, a wave of seasonal flu originates in China to feed a subnetwork. the persistence of such bias highlights the continuing need to sequence viruses in underrepresented areas, especially the tropics. the current influenza vaccine is formulated separately for the northern and southern Hemisphere; one can surmise that two viral strains may not be enough. the advent of 2009 pandemic S-OIV has largely depleted the number of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 infections. however, the fact that H1N1 shares a tropic-centric movement pattern with H3N2 despite cross-reactivity suggests that these patterns may still persist even in the presence of the cross-reactive S-OIV. isolate were obtained using geolocation information from Google Maps. sequences were aligned and those that were poorly aligned compared to the rest of the dataset were removed until all sequences aligned with a Hamming distance no greater than 0.15 of the sequence length. the best predictor of a seeding region for each season had the greatest ratio of observed to expected seeding events. the best predictor of a seeding region for each season had the greatest ratio of observed to expected seeding events with a p-value smaller than 0.05. we calculated the sequence similarity of each virus to all earlier isolates. a chain of related viruses in the same region and season would be collapsed into a single umbrella node representing all of them. the closest ancestor of a given cluster of sequences is from a different region or season.
