{"summary": "the importance of interactions between human, wildlife and domestic animal populations, the potential for rapid global spread of emerging pathogens and appreciation of the need to carry out surveillance. there are concerns about the impacts of neglected, endemic zoonotic pathogens, particularly in marginalized and impoverished communities, and the critical role of surveillance in generating data to demonstrate the true burden of these diseases. human health have been designed to promote capacity building at the national level. early detection and reporting of disease cases is critical for initiating preventive measures before localized outbreaks develop into large-scale epidemics. surveillance of animal populations offers the opportunity to detect pathogens earlier in the transmission or emergence pathway, before introduction to and potential spread in, human populations. despite increased interest and investment in global surveillance, the scale of the task is considerable and many challenges remain. cutting-edge research to identify predictors of disease emergence and technological innovations for pathogen screening and discovery are promising advances. but these approaches are currently associated with uncertainties that limit their effective translation (discussed in 2a) zoonoses and disease reporting zoonoses are often underreported. many factors contribute to underreporting, arising from both an inability and unwillingness to report. analysis of data obtained through the HealthMap system found bias towards increased reporting from countries with more media outlets, more developed public health resources and greater electronic communications infrastructure. reliance of high-tech surveillance systems upon existing communications infrastructures such as the internet has the potential to compound the degree to which developing countries are underrepresented. many of the more developed mobile-phone-based participatory systems for public health are described by Freifeld et al. [26] an inventory of mobile phone data collection applications is maintained online (http://www.unglobalpulse.org/resources/mobile-phone-data-collection-inventory). most of these applications focus on human populations, and their potential application for animal disease surveillance has yet to be fully explored or exploited [35]. zoonoses often fall in the gap between the animal and human health sectors. there are no dedicated systems to govern official reporting of zoonoses. in the animal sector, the closest equivalent to the IHR is the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the OIE [38]. the lack of tangible benefits at grassroots level is disempowering and de-motivating at the grassroots level for healthcare and veterinary workers alike. the absence of direct benefits, combined with the costs of making a report, make it understandable that individuals often choose not to report outbreaks. the oIE and WHO publish guidelines that describe which diseases are considered notifiable. poor communication between institutions at national level Surveillance is ultimately a matter of communication between stakeholders. poor communication between institutions at national level Surveillance is ultimately a matter of communication between stakeholders. in many african countries, the policy framework enables private animal health service providers to deliver private clinical services. a report on the response to the west Nile virus outbreaks in the USA indicates that better communication between stakeholders would be helpful in tackling future outbreaks. the revised IHR now includes new powers for the WHO to initiate a response to a PHEIC without official notification from the nation state in which it is detected. reliance on rumour-based reporting also has potential negative consequences. internet-based systems provide powerful tools for real-time reporting and communication of surveillance data. many of these systems rely on sophisticated software to search and extract information from web-based sources and are motivated by a need to make better use of currently existing data. zoonoses that are not yet known to be human or animal pathogens are not yet known to be human or animal pathogens. many uncertainties remain as to the appropriate response to the detection of numerous novel micro-organisms in human or animal populations. mobile phones have enormous potential for improving health systems, including surveillance. the current proliferation of mobile-phone-based systems has the potential to overwhelm rather than assist the existing surveillance networks. mobile-phone-based systems are likely to suffer from many of the same challenges as paper-based systems. at the international level, there are no dedicated systems to govern official reporting of zoonoses. zoonoses outbreaks have been estimated at $400 million for Nipah virus in Malaysia. costs of recent zoonoses outbreaks have been estimated at $11 000 million for BSE in the UK and $50\u2013120 000 million for severe acute respiratory syndrome. people reporting in the field need to be genuinely integrated as key partners within international surveillance systems and empowered within effective local networks. the oIE and WHO publish guidelines that describe which diseases are considered notifiable [13,38] a report on the response to the west Nile virus outbreaks in the USA indicates that better communication between stakeholders would be helpful in tackling future outbreaks. the revised IHR now includes new powers for the WHO to initiate a response to a PHEIC without official notification from the nation state in which it is detected [2,36]. reliance on rumour-based reporting also has potential negative consequences. lack of tangible benefits at grassroots level is disempowering and de-motivating. lack of tangible benefits at grassroots level is disempowering and de-motivating. the OIE and WHO publish guidelines that describe which diseases are notifiable. they list pathogens that should be reported, and also define more flexible requirements for reporting of unusual/emerging disease events. in many developing countries, the data and infrastructures required to detect non-reporting are simply not available. the policy framework enables private animal health service providers (PAHSPs) to deliver private clinical services, while district veterinary officers (DVOs) are responsible for regulatory and quality control functions. there can be significant barriers to this information flow, particularly when relationships between DVOs and PAHSPs are strained by service provision disputes. this problem is not unique to developing country settings. there is a risk of perpetuating a lack of transparency and trust within the global reporting system. focusing on endemic zoonoses surveillance Expanding the scope of international surveillance efforts to include both endemic and emerging zoonoses has the potential to address some major existing constraints. endemic zoonoses have been described as \u2018low hanging fruit\u2019 for disease control investments [45], with control tools available and cost-effective strategies evaluated. endemic zoonoses impose considerable human and animal health burdens [5], and successes in tackling these would be of benefit in their own right. the developing world has been identified as a weak spot in current surveillance capacity. countries are more likely to invest in surveillance for diseases they can control. the implementation of an effective response to reporting of endemic disease is likely to foster a culture of reporting at grassroots levels. incentives for reporting may include eligibility for quality certification schemes or compensation schemes in the event of an outbreak in which livestock are compulsorily slaughtered. compensation schemes may prove challenging in more resource-limited settings, because a pre-existing record of animal ownership is required. initiatives designed to build surveillance activities into continuing professional development schemes can provide non-financial incentives. there are significant challenges and risks associated with this strategy. it is not yet clear how best to build surveillance systems for unknown pathogens. there are risks that the creation of \u2018new\u2019 systems will distort funding priorities and divert much needed resources away from current infectious disease challenges. investment in the surveillance of endemic zoonoses provides a mechanism for building exactly the core capacities that are likely to enable the detection of emerging infections. endemic zoonoses impose considerable human and animal health burdens [5], and successes in tackling these would be of benefit in their own right. schemes to distribute ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis have strengthened primary healthcare. investments in tackling endemic zoonoses will undoubtedly contribute to building effective communications between institutions. building on small successes can pave the way for more ambitious global goals of preventing emerging pandemics. incentives to reporting often focus on tangible financial benefits, but the greatest incentive may be the provision of simple responses, including acknowledgement of a report, feedback of diagnostic test results and advice on management of the disease problem. mobile-phone-based systems provide a direct means of communication between sectors, across hierarchies and to at-risk populations. more investments need to make the best possible use of existing surveillance capacities. there is a need to create a 'culture of surveillance' in the developing world."}
