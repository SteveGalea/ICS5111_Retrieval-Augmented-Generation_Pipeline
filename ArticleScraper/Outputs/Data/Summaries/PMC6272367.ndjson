{"summary": "lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immunoglobulin nature. they are capable of recognition and reversible binding to complicated glycoconjugates moieties without altering covalent structure of any recognized glycosyl ligands. they are involved in many biological processes like recognition and binding of carbohydrates, host-pathogen interactions, cell targeting, cell-cell communication and induction of apoptosis. apoptosis of uninfected cells, direct viral killing of infected cells and killing of infected CD4+ cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes occur. the envelope protein complex determines viral tropism and facilitates the membrane fusion process that allows invasion of the viral genome. gp120 and gp41 GP160 are extensively glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved. gp41 is non-covalently bound to gp120 because it is buried within the viral envelope. when gp120 binds to CD4, it will change its conformation and gp41 will become exposed. this makes them particularly attractive targets for the development as novel antiviral drugs. lectins that exhibit antiviral activity and bind high-mannose carbohydrates are jacalin [25], concanavalin A [26], Urtica diocia agglutinin [27], Myrianthus holstii lectin, and Narcissus pseudonarcissus lectin [29]. the natural antiviral products that exhibit the highest activity among the lectins are cyanovirin-N, scytovirin, microcystis vir concanavalin A is a carbohydrate-binding protein isolated from canavalia ensiformis or jack bean. it is a homotetramer with a molecular mass of 26.5 kDa. it has 235 amino acid residues and binds specifically to certain structures. lectin-mediated neutralization has not been completely elucidated. there is a minimum of two mechanisms, a direct one and an indirect mechanism to account the efficacy of removal of only a few glycans to render HIV resistant. mutated N-glycosylation sites harbor the \u201ckey target glycans\u201d for lectin-mediated neutralization. carbohydrate-binding agents force the virus to delete a part of its glycan shield. this can be the initiation of an immune response against previously hidden immunogenic envelope epitopes. the immune system will be triggered to act against previously hidden immunogenic envelope epitopes. lectins from Galanthus, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, Epipactis helleborine, and Listera ovata would be targeted at the virus-cell fusion process [56]. 6.4. Musa Acuminata (Banana) Lectin Banana lectin binds to the glycosylated viral envelope and inhibits cellular entry. Narcissus pseudonarcissus is also known as wild daffodil or Lent lily. it produces seeds and is native to western Europe. it contains a dimeric protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. it contains specificity toward -linked mannose. tica diocia agglutinin is a special plant lectin that differs from other plant lectins. the cytopathic effect of HIV has a rate of EC50 = 105 nM [28] and has a molecular mass of 8.5 kDa. this is a T cell mitogen distinguishable from classical T cell mitogens. concanavalin A is a carbohydrate-binding protein isolated from canavalia ensiformis. it is a member of the legume lectin family and is used for human nutrition or animal fodder. the plant contains large quantities of the enzyme urease. lectin-mediated neutralization has not been completely elucidated. but there is a minimum of two mechanisms, a direct one and an indirect mechanism. the removal of only a few glycans to render HIV resistant has been reported. the carbohydrate-binding agents force the virus to delete a part of its glycan shield so it can escape drug pressure. the immune system will be triggered to act against previously hidden immunogenic epitopes of the viral envelope. myrianthus holstii lectin binds to the glycosylated viral envelope. it inhibits cellular entry and thus suppresses HIV-1 infection. its anti-HIV activity is comparable to snowdrop lectin and Griffithsin. donarcissus Lectin Narcissus pseudonarcissus is also known as wild daffodil or Lent lily. it contains a dimeric protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. it is composed of two 13-kDa subunits. cytopathic effect of HIV has a rate of EC50 = 105 nM [28] and has a small molecular mass of 8.5 kDa. lectin suppressed entry of HIV-1 into host cells with a half-maximal effective concentration at 8.2 nM. the binding of griffithsin to gp120 was not inhibited by fucose, xylose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine or sialic acid containing glycoproteins. Griffithsin binds the terminal mannose residues of surface N-linked glycans on HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis C virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Griffithsin synergizes with antiviral drugs enfuvirtide, maraviroc and tenofovir against HIV-1 clade B and clade C isolates in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. a discrepancy exists between HIV-1 gp120 binding activity and HIV inhibitory activity of the griffithsin variants D30A, D112A, and D70A. a discrepancy exists between HIV-1 gp120 binding activity and HIV inhibitory activity of the griffithsin variants D30A, D70A, and D112A. Griffithsin synergizes with other carbohydrate-binding agents in inhibitory action against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against HIV-1 strains demonstrating resistance to some carbohydrate-binding agents. syncytium formation between HIV-1-infected and uninfected T cells, DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 capture and transmission to CD4+ target T cells. both are competitive inhibitors of the binding of the Man(1\u20132)Man-specific 2G12 monoclonal antibody. the lectin is a 13-kDa protein with 121 amino acids isolated from the red alga Griffithsia. it blocks CD4-dependent GP120 binding to the receptor expressing cells. it inhibits binding of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2G12, which recognizes a carbohydrate-dependent motif. the interaction between griffithsin and gp120 relies on the trimeric \u201csugar tower\u201d including N295 and N448. Griffithsin suppresses HIV gp120 binding to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGN-mediated transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Griffithsin mutants D30A, D112A, and D70A showed only a 2\u20133 fold decrement in binding to immobilized gp120 but 26- or more fold decline in HIV inhibiting ability in single-round HIV infection assays, HIV cytopathicity assays and co-cultivation assays. gp120 binding does not necessarily ensue in an antiviral effect. Griffithsin synergizes with other carbohydrate-binding agents in inhibitory action against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against HIV-1 strains. the carbohydrate-binding agents tested have different binding patterns on the gp120 envelope and hence no steric hindrance. s showed synergistic activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against certain glycan binding sites on gp120. there might be no steric hindrance between two different CBAs in their competition for glycan binding (except for the HHA/GNA combination) cyanovirin-N inhibited in vitro cytopathicity of laboratory strains and several clinical isolates of HIV type 1, 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. it also effectively prevented cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV from infected cells to uninfected cells. cyanovirin-N and the mono-PEGylated derivative potentiate the anti-HIV activity of AZT, griffithsin, and cyanovirin [77]. CVN specifically recognizes with nanomolar affinity Man(9)GlcNAc(2) and the D1D3 isomer of Man(8)GlcNAc(2). ystis viridis lectin binds oligomannosides with sub-micromolar affinities. the residues make numerous intermolecular contacts with their carbohydrate ligands. this lectin inhibits HIV type 1 envelope-mediated cell fusion with an IC50. nostoc ellipsosporum shows virucidal activity against several viruses. it was discovered during a screening program in the search for naturally occurring virucidal agents that may be developed into anti-HIV microbicides. it consists of a single 101 amino acid chain that exhibits significant internal sequence duplication. linker- cyanovirin-N is an antiviral protein isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium. it contains two homologous domains, one comprising amino acids 1\u201348 and the second amino acids 49\u201395.
