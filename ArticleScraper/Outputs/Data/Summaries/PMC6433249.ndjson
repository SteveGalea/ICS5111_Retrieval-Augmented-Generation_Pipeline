{"summary": "dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which includes four major serotypes. some serotypes cause more severe diseases than the other; severe dengue is associated with secondary infections by a different serotype. timely serotyping can provide early warning of dengue epidemics to improve management of patients and outbreaks. the introduction dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. deNV infection causes a wide range of clinical signs in humans, from asymptomatic to acute febrile illness (dengue fever, DF) to severe hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndromes (DHF/DSS) DENV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus) a positive association was established between DENV infection in humans and mosquitoes at very fine spatiotemporal scales in the natural setting. several multiplex qRT-PCR methods capable of serotyping have been reported [18\u201320] but performance of qRT-PCR tests requires skilled technicians and relatively expensive equipment. a rapid, easy, mobile, NAT method of high sensitivity and specificity is needed to bring early serotyping of DENV to points of need. a pan-DENV-specific RT-iiPCR assay was validated recently on the POCKIT system. four singleplex DENV serotyping reagents have become available for the identification of DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4 serotypes separately on the POCKIT system. reagents allow DENV serotyping near patients and soon after the mosquitoes are trapped even at low-resource settings. adult female mosquitoes, aged 7\u20138 days, were cold anesthetized and inoculated using a microcapillary needle. the 4 serotype of dengue virus stocks were standardized to 2x106 PFU/ml. 0.2 l was injected into each mosquito (approximately 400 PFU/mosquito) four DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents were performed as described in their user manuals. the default program, including an RT step at 50\u00b0C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95\u00b0C for about 30 min, was completed in less than 1 h. the default program, including an RT step at 50\u00b0C for 10 min, was completed in less than 1 h. the reaction was performed with a superscript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit. each reaction included 5 l of the sample nucleic acid. signals from the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 probes were collected using the 6-carboxyfluorescein, hexachlorofluorescein, Texas red, and Cy5 channels. Zika virus strains were from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. adult female mosquitoes aged 7\u20138 days were cold anesthetized and inoculated using a microcapillary needle. each mosquito sample was homogenized in 250 l PBS with a disposable grinder. 200 l of the upper aqueous sample were transferred into the first well of the preloaded extraction plate before starting the extraction program. dev-1\u20134 real-time reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction. reference qRT-PCR assay includes 4 sets of oligonucleotide primers and 4 dually labeled 5\u2019 fluorescent TaqMan probes to differentiate the four serotypes. each reaction included 5 l of the sample nucleic acid. the 100% detection endpoints were found at 10 and 1 PFU/ml DENV-1 with the reference qRT-PCR and DENV-1 RT-iiPCR, respectively. all data indicated that the four DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RT-iiPCR had analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR. all four singleplex DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents did not react with the other three non-targeted dengue virus serotypes. the reagents did not react with the other three non-targeted dengue virus serotypes, Zika virus and chikungunya virus. x 105 negative negative negative negative negative negative ZIKV PRVABC59 2.5 x 104 negative negative negative negative negative negative CHIKV MR766 1.2 x 105 negative negative negative DENV, dengue virus; ZIKV, Zika virus; CHIKV, chikungunya virus; PFU, plaque forming unit; RT-iiPCR, reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction. 20 and 19 samples were determined to be DENV-3 positive and negative. one sample was DENV-3 negative by the index assay but positive by the reference assay. compared to the reference qRT-PCR, the DENV-1 RT-iiPCR and DENV-4 RT-iiPCR had 100% overall agreement. 97.5% (89.8 100%) Positive 20 0 20 Negative 1 19 20 Total 21 19 40 DENV-3 RT-iiPCR DENV-3 95% (80.6 100%) 100% (88.1 100%) 97.5% (89.8 100%) Positive 20 0 20 Negative 0 20 20 Total 20 20 40 DENV, dengue virus; RT-iiPCR, reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction; qRT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-poly dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were detected by dengue virus serotype 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-specific RT-iiPCR reagents on POCKIT nucleic acid analyzer. the detection endpoints of the DENV-1, -2, -3, -4 serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents were evaluated by side-by-side comparison. all data indicated that the four DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RT-iiPCR had analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR in detecting their target DENV serotypes. all data indicated that the four RT-iiPCR had analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR in detecting their target DENV serotypes. all four singleplex DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents did not react with the other three non-targeted dengue virus serotypes. yping RT-iiPCR to assess the clinical performance of each DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagent. 20 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 20 DENV-3, and 20 DENV-negative samples previously identified by a real-time PCR [34] were tested for each respective reagent. matched results were found for DENV-1 detection (20 positive and 20 negative) between the DENV-1 RT-iiPCR and the reference multiplex qRT-PCR. the DENV-2 RT-iiPCR had 97% overall agreement (CI95%, 89.8\u201397.5%) and the DENV-3 RT-iiPCR had 97% overall agreement (CI95%, 89.8\u201397.5%) clinical performance characteristics of dengue virus serotypes 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-specific RT-iiPCR reagents on the POCKIT nucleic acid analyzer for the detection of dengue virus in human serum. serotype-specific detection of dengue virus serotypes 1\u20134 in mosquitoes. hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus and the compact taco mini are available in a suitcase for pathogen surveillance. qRT-iiPCR, reverse transcription-insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction; qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR can help improve the recognition of severe dengue warning signs. timely reporting on detection and serotyping of DENV in mosquito can serve as an alert to people who fall ill to consider the possibility of dengue infection. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/POCKIT system validated previously for the detection of all four DENV serotypes in human plasma and serum [32, 33] is useful in aiding the identification of acute DENV infection, especially for remote regions with high burdens of DENV infection. however, this system could not differentiate between different DENV serotypes. current commercially available NS1 immunological test products are rapid and do not require trained personnel to operate. the four POCKIT singleplex serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents have potential to serve as a relatively inexpensive, rapid and simple PON tool."}
