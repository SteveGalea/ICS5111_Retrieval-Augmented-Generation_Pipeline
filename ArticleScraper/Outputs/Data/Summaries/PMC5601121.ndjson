{"summary": "biflavonoids have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-virus, anti-microbial, vasorelaxant and anticlotting properties. amentoflavone derived from Selaginella tamariscina or Torreya nucifera has been shown to have potent anti-candidal or anti-SARS-coV activities. ginkgetin is a strong NF-B inhibitor (IC50 = 7.5 DMGF inhibited the migration of B16F10 melanoma cells. migration was quantitated by counting the cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter after fixation and staining. tumor metastasis is a complex process and consists of a series of sequential steps. DMGF down-regulated the expressions of genes associated with the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to lower the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of the CREB transcriptional factor. DMGF down-regulated the expressions of the genes associated with the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to lower the formation of lamellipodia. DMGF suppressed the metastasis of tumor cells by suppressing migration and matrix degradation. a transwell assay indicated that low dosages of DMGF also significantly inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. however, the treatments of DMGF had no effect on the tube formation of SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. tumor-bearing mice were treated with or without i.v. injections of DMGF to determine its effects on angiogenesis. the size of angiogenetic vessels in the dorsal skin were correlated with DMGF dosages. tumor-bearing mice were examined to determine whether the tumor cells could spontaneously metastasize from subcutaneous sites to the organs. all organs but the spleen were examined and the melanoma cells were undetectable. DMGF treatments lowered the number of spontaneously metastatic cells in the spleen 5-fold relative to the untreated group. the numbers of metastatic nodules in the lungs of some mice were too large to count. the results indicated that the DMGF treatments reduced the colonization more than 3-fold. DMGF suppressed metastasis to the lymph node in a dose-dependent manner. 10 mg/Kg DMGF lowered lymphoid metastasis from 80% to 16%. DMGF treatment effectively inhibited the B16F10 cells' metastatic ability in vivo. DMGF dramatically suppressed the expression of LIMK, and also decreased the expression of PAK1. DMGF could enhance actin depolymerization and suppress formation of lamellipodia by lowering expression of relative genes. DMGF may interfere with phosphorylation on ser133 of CREB. results showed that DMGF did not notably decrease CREB protein expression. DMGF could decrease the activity of CREB to lower expression of genes that correspond to formation of lamellipodia. treatment with DMGF for 12 or 24 h significantly inhibited the MMP-2 expression of B16F10 cells but not MMP-9 compared to untreated B16F10 cells. DMGF may suppress the metastasis of tumor cells by suppressing migration and matrix degradation. DMGF could inhibit the cell proliferation of endothelial cells. the relative percent of migrated cells were counted by an inverted light microscope at 100 magnification. the relative percent of migrated cells was counted and summarized in the bottom panel. ten random fields were chosen for each count. tumor-bearing mice were examined to determine whether the tumor cells could spontaneously metastasize from subcutaneous sites to the organs. DMGF treatments lowered the number of spontaneously metastatic cells in the spleen 5-fold relative to the untreated group. the DMGF group contains mice that were i.v. injected with 50 mg/kg DMGF. &E staining, the melanoma cells were estimated by counting and averaging 10 fields of every slide under a light microscope at 400 magnification. significant differences after treatment were found for the DMGF related group compared with the PBS group. DMGF treatments slowed down the migration of tumor cells into the lymph node. however, DMGF suppressed metastasis to the lymph node in a dose-dependent manner. the effects of DMGF on lymph nodule metastasis of melanoma were shown. intracellular actin fiber staining showed that DMGF treatments caused the fragmentation of F-actin. it is well known that the Cdc42 and Rac pathway can regulate actin polymerization. DMGF dramatically suppressed the expression of LIMK, and also decreased the expression of PAK1. the results showed that only one transcriptional factor binding site is displayed on all 5 promoter sequences of these genes\u2013CREB. DMGF could interfere with phosphorylation on the Ser133 of CREB which involves in the transcriptional activity. the DMGF was shown to dramatically suppress the spontaneous metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells from subcutaneous sites to the spleen. DMGF could suppress the processes of metastasis, including colonization from blood circulation or invasion/intravasation into the lymph system. the decrease in the metastasis of melanoma cells may result from low migratory ability. DMGF may have a higher potency than other flavonoids on the inhibition of migration. highly metastatic cancer cells often produce high levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the extracellular matrix surrounding them and to invade other tissues. DMGF has a stronger ability to suppress only MMP2 gene expression, but only a slight effect on MMP9 expression for melanoma cells. some flavonoids could suppress such cell activity. for example, apigenin (50 M) could influence F-actin cytoskeleton formation. 60 M wogonin could suppress cell migration and actin remodeling. DMGF treatments reduced the phosphorylation at Ser133 of CREB. but it did not influence the expression of CREB protein. this is in accord with the bioinformatics result which DMGF interacted with the amino acids near Ser133 of CREB. two biflavonoids, amentoflavone (AF) and morelloflavone (MF) have anti-angiogenic activities. the anti-angiogenic activity of AF is due to its ability to bind VEGF-A and VEGF-B, preventing the interaction with VEGF receptors for anti-angiogenesis. however, our data indicated that DMGF did not impact VEGF-induced capillary-like tube formation. SVEC4-10 is a highly proliferative endothelial cell line derived by SV40 transformation of endothelial cells. however, DMGF has different antiproliferative effects between cancer cell lines and primary cells, including human PBMCs and mouse splenocytes. DMGF was assumed to be a novel chemoprevention drug with limited toxicity in normal tissues. SVEC4-10 mouse vascular endothelial cells and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells were purchased from BCRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) the cells (1 104 cells/well) were seeded overnight in a 96-well plate. SVEC 4\u201310 cells (3 104) were treated with or without 1 g/ml DMGF in growth medium containing 16 ng/ml of VEGF. the total number of network formations was counted. real-time PCR B16F10 cells (1 106 cells/well) were treated with or without DMGF. the reaction mixture contained 1 l cDNA, 0.25 l forward primer, 0.25 l reverse primer, 11 l DDW, and 12.5 l 2X real Q PCR master mix.

DMGF preparation DMGF (98% purity by high performance liquid chromatography) isolated from the dried needles of Taxus media var. Hicksii (10 kg) were extracted with methanol (MeOH) at a preferred ratio of 1:1 (w/v) at room temperature to yield a methanol extract. SVEC4-10 cells were pre-cultured with 1 g/ml DMGF for 6 h. then plated (3 104 cells/well) in the upper well of a transwell plate. cells on the top of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. real-time PCR B16F10 cells (1 106 cells/well) were treated with or without DMGF (1 g/ml) for 12 or 24 h. total B16F10 cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System.
