{"summary": "migration is commonly assumed to enhance the geographical spread of pathogens. migration can lower infection risk for many animals, in part, by removing infected individuals during strenuous journeys. humans can intentionally or unintentionally provide food for wildlife, in the context of urbanization, agriculture, recreation, or wildlife management. seasonal migration lowers transmission of some pathogens. resident populations could support greater parasite burdens due to persistently high host densities, longer breeding seasons and absence of mechanisms that reduce parasitism during migration. a crucial need exists to investigate how resident animals affect the population dynamics of migratory populations. to illustrate changes in migratory behaviours, we highlight case studies on migratory fish, birds and mammals and their parasites. we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a debilitating protozoan parasite as a case study for which recent increases in resident behaviour have facilitated high infection prevalence. reports of populations increasing their tendency to become resident in response to human-provided resources are accumulating in the literature. these shifts in migratory behaviours can happen over relatively short timescales [19,54,55] and are taxonomically and geographically widespread. implications of resource-driven changes in movement for population biology and ecology of migratory species were recently identified as a key emerging issue in wildlife conservation. blackbirds used to be migratory between central Europe and the Mediterranean. now 50% of birds stay near breeding grounds all year, possibly driven by foods and climate Berthold. some migratory species are fed by wildlife managers to support populations or limit human\u2013wildlife conflicts. supplemental feeding of elk can delay migration, shorten migratory journeys. supplemental feeding of both white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) has been found to delay spring migration, thus prolonging duration of stay on the winter range. the effects of feeding on long-distance migration of bull sharks have been hypothesized but remain untested. non-migratory sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens) and Southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) demonstrated higher site fidelity associated with provisioning. other migratory populations can use foods that are unintentionally provided. evolutionary losses of traits important for migration might occur in newly formed resident populations. we need to understand whether and how animals that curtail or abandon migrations interact with remaining long-distance migrants. migration can have profound consequences for species interactions, including for the ecology of infectious disease. support for migratory escape has been observed for migratory ungulates, including caribou (Rangifer tarandus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and elk. long-distance migration can lower parasite prevalence by removing infected animals from the population (i.e. migratory culling) migration reduces transmission by separating more susceptible (S) and more infected (I) individuals during migration, thus limiting contact rates. migratory populations travel to spawning grounds, where adults die or depart after depositing offspring. evidence for migratory allopatry in lowering infection risk comes from long-term studies of sea lice in Pacific salmon [38,97] more work is needed to understand interactions between supplemental feeding, disease risk and animal migrations. supplemental resources from unintentional sources can cause changes in migratory behaviour, with consequences that raise or reduce infection risk. supplemental resources from unintentional sources can cause changes in migratory behaviour. migratory escape and consequences for its loss would probably be most pronounced for specialist parasites that do not use alternative hosts during the absence of migrants [5], causing parasites to die in the environment by the time their obligate hosts return. the loss of migratory escape could alter the relative importance of different modes of pathogen transmission. researchers could measure abundance and viability of parasite infectious stages in the environment at sites where parasites might accumulate. if hosts stop migrating or travel shorter distances, survival of infected animals could increase in absence of physiological and energetic demands of migration. migratory culling (or its loss) might be less important for species like silver Y moths (Autographa gamma) that take advantage of directional winds and use minimal self-propulsion. the most direct tests of migratory culling in the field would compare survival during migration (or migratory distances travelled) of healthy versus infected individuals and scale these against survival estimates for resident animals that do not migrate. migratory recovery occurs when infected hosts recover from infections during migration due to changes in environmental conditions that are unsuitable to the parasite. high densities of farmed salmon can support heavy loads of parasitic sea lice. the farms have been linked to high lice-induced mortality of wild chum and pink salmon. increased host density could be due to longer breeding seasons, greater recruitment of susceptible animals and aggregation around supplemental resources. residents could encounter a less diverse community of pathogens, compared to migrants, by remaining in the same environment year-round [79,115] resident bird species harbouring lower parasite richness of nematodes and helminths in general [117], compared with migratory species. higher residency and lower migration rates among water birds may limit dispersal of pathogens or pathogen subtypes. however, higher residency may provide more opportunities for pathogens to accumulate in environmental reservoirs and potentially for higher virulence to evolve. additional work using transmission models to explore consequences of increased residency for avian influenza dynamics is needed. residents can act as reservoirs of pathogens and expose migrants to infection. avian influenza subtypes are maintained in year-round mallard populations. residents can act as reservoirs of pathogens, as with blood parasites in resident birds. the loss of migratory escape could alter the relative importance of different modes of pathogen transmission. pathogens such as baculovirus in african armyworms and neogregarines in monarchs use two modes of transmission. the loss of migratory escape could alter the relative importance of different modes of transmission. ident populations in both models experienced high infection prevalence owing to the loss of migratory escape. future empirical work could examine the loss of migratory escape in wild populations undergoing rapid behavioural change. investigators could measure abundance and viability of parasite infectious stages in the environment at sites where parasites might accumulate. the most direct tests of migratory culling would compare survival during migration (or migratory distances travelled) of healthy versus infected individuals and scale these against survival estimates for resident animals that do not migrate. migratory recovery occurs when infected hosts recover from infections during migration due to changes in environmental conditions that are unsuitable to the parasite. the introduction of fish farms in outdoor semi-enclosed sea pens has altered this relationship. high densities of farmed salmon (acting as year-round resident salmon) can support heavy loads of parasitic sea lice. the farms have been linked to high lice-induced mortality of wild chum and pink salmon. resident populations supported by human-provided resources may experience crowding, stress and greater susceptibility to infection. residents could encounter a less diverse community of pathogens, compared to migrants, by remaining in the same environment year-round [79,115] higher residency may limit dispersal of pathogens or pathogen subtypes. higher residency may also provide more opportunities for pathogens to accumulate in environmental reservoirs and potentially for higher virulence to evolve. residents can act as reservoirs of pathogens and expose migrants to infection. avian influenza subtypes are maintained in year-round mallard populations. residents can act as reservoirs of pathogens and expose migrants to infection. a case study illustrating how shifts from migratory to resident behaviour alter host\u2013parasite interactions. the interaction between monarch butterflies and a debilitating protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE) serves as a model host\u2013parasite system to investigate how resource subsidy-driven changes in migratory behaviour influence the spread and impacts of infectious disease. study involving citizen scientists showed resident monarchs at (d) winter-breeding sites (blue points) compared to migratory sites (orange points for summer breeding; green points for overwintering) showed (e) five times higher infection prevalence on average. migratory culling and migratory escape contribute to pattern. monarchs have experienced population declines coincident with the loss of breeding and overwintering habitats in both eastern and western North America [148\u2013153]. Efforts to replace monarch breeding habitat have included planting milkweed in gardens and yards. in the southern USA, newly formed resident monarch populations have become common. high infection prevalence has been attributed to the loss of both migratory escape and culling. heavily parasitized monarchs and OE-contaminated tropical milkweed plants could act as a source of infection for migratory monarchs. this is most likely to happen during autumn and spring, as migrants pass through sites occupied by resident monarchs. new empirical work could inform mathematical models that explore the loss of mechanisms during shifts from migratory to resident behaviours. new empirical work could inform mathematical models that explore the loss of mechanisms during shifts from migratory to resident behaviours. more work is needed to understand how migratory and newly resident populations interact. supplemental feeding and changes in animal migration will alter parasite evolution. loss of migration may release constraints on parasite virulence and allow more highly virulent parasites to thrive once hosts no longer undergo strenuous journeys. future work is needed to evaluate the role of these populations in interacting with migratory animals. residents could provide a rescue effect to shrinking migratory populations but also act as a source of parasites for these animals."}
