{"summary": "EBOV-Z and EBOV-S are responsible for the majority of outbreaks of highly pathogenic haemorrhagic fevers causing high fatality rates. a strain of EBOV-Z is responsible for the majority of outbreaks of highly pathogenic haemorrhagic fevers causing high fatality rates. this epidemic has triggered a significant global health response. several vaccines have been fast-tracked into phase I clinical trials 6\u20138. patients suffering a haemorrhagic fever have relied on the clinical management of symptoms. a handful of patients receiving experimental therapies such as ZMapp, TKM-Ebola, brincidofovir and favipiravir have relied on the clinical management of symptoms. to this end we re-examine the anti-viral properties of CQ. we also show that licensed and widely used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for treatment of gastric acid reflux, omeprazole (OM) and esomeprazole (ESOM), inhibited PV EBOV entry. OM and ESOM were prepared in sterile DMSO (Sigma) Plasmid constructs The Bundibugyo ebolavirus (EBOV-B) envelope glycoprotein (GP) coding sequence was synthesised. the HA glycoprotein of avian influenza A/turkey/England/50-92/91(H5N1) (FLU-H5) was amplified from the HA plasmid of the H5N1 reverse genetic neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens was added 24 h after transfection. EBOV PVs were harvested at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. the remaining PVs were stored at -80\u00b0C. cell culture human embryonic kidney (293T/17) (ATCC) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (ATTC) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biosera) and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin (PS) were resuspended as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. glycoprotein (GP) (FJ217161) coding sequence was synthesised. both were sub-cloned into pCAGGS expression vector. gene was sub-cloned into pCAGGS expressing vector from a minigenome reporter described previously 26. EBOV PVs were aliquoted and stored at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. the remaining PVs were stored at -80\u00b0C. PV transduction RLUs were normalised to the Renilla value in the corresponding wells. percent infection of each drug dilution was calculated compared to untreated cells. IC 50 values were calculated using non-linear regression analysis. luciferase expression plasmid was added to each well after 48 hours incubation. the supernatant was removed and firefly and Renilla luciferase RLUs were recorded using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) only BafA1 appeared to reduce expression of Renilla at the highest concentrations. b 1.11 3.33 10 EBOV-Z 1.213 0.195 ns * **** EBOV-B 3.297 0.233 ns ns *** FLU-H5 3.510 0.282 ns ns *** GALV ns ns ns ns ns Chloroquine Pseudotype virus IC 50 (M) a Std.

OM and ESOM appeared to decrease fluorescence, and therefore increase endosomal pH, only at a concentration of 200M, higher than that required to inhibit PV entry. the effects of OM and ESOM on endosomal acidification have also been previously reported 32, 33. inhibition of pseudotype virus entry by existing FDA-approved drugs 293T cells were transfected 24hours earlier then mixed with set dilutions of drug. after 48hours incubation firefly and Renilla values were normalised to the corresponding Renilla value. percent infection at each dilution was calculated using the average values of the untreated control. 293T cells transfected with a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid were diluted in triplicate in white bottomed 96-well plates. the supernatant was removed and firefly and Renilla luciferase RLUs were recorded using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) only BafA1 appeared to reduce expression of Renilla at the highest concentrations. b 1.11 3.33 10 EBOV-Z 1.213 0.195 ns * **** EBOV-B 3.297 0.233 ns ns *** FLU-H5 3.510 0.282 ns ns *** GALV ns ns ns ns Chloroquine Pseudotype virus IC 50 (M) a Std.

EBOV-B, MARV and FLU-H5 PVs by ESOM were significant at 50M. GALV PV was not significantly inhibited at this dose. effects of OM and ESOM on endosomal acidification have also been previously reported 32, 33. 33 and 1.11nM ( I\u2013L) and OM and ESOM were diluted to 100, 50 and 25M ( M\u2013P) and ( Q\u2013T) respectively. level of fluorescence was imaged by confocal microscopy (x50 magnification) inhibition of pseudotype virus entry by existing FDA-approved drugs 293T cells were transfected 24hours previous then mixed with set dilutions of drug and infected with PVs. a \u2018fusion inhibitor\u2019 could target the host cell machinery preventing acidification of the endosome. a \u2018fusion inhibitor\u2019 could target the host cell machinery preventing acidification of the endosome, working to inhibit virus entry of several different viruses. this correlates with their ability to prevent the acidification of intracellular organelles. Ekins et al. suggested the anti-EBOV mechanism of CQ may be by binding the VP35 protein of EBOV 49. if this drug had activity on several steps of the replication cycle it may not only be more effective in vivo but even less likely that the virus could mutate. EBOV, MARV and MARV were inhibited by lower doses of OM or ESOM than GALV entry. this was due to a toxic effect that was not measured by the Renilla control we employed here. standard adult dosing (25mg/kg) achieves plasma concentration of 2M. protection in the mouse model was previously shown with a 90mg/kg dosage 18, 66. re-purposed drugs must surely be approached with caution."}
