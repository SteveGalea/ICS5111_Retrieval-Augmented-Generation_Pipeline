{"summary": "a diagnostic study was performed to compare conventional viral tests with the recently developed real-time PCR technique. PCR was used to test for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1\u20134, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and adenoviruses. the majority of LRTIs in this young age group is believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. conventional methods are commonly used: viral culture and direct immunofluorescence assays. a third method based on molecular techniques has now become available, namely (real-time) PCR. rapid and sensitive testing for a broad range of respiratory viruses is vital in the PICU. it can be used to guide cohorting strategies that may protect other critically ill children. evaluation of viral tests may be of future importance, when antiviral therapy becomes more widely available. the material was used for immediate viral culture of RSV, influenzaviruses, parainfluenzaviruses (PIVs) 1\u20133, picornaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses on LLC-MK2, RD, R-HELA and HEP-2C cells. the remaining material was used for real-time PCR testing. RT was carried out for 30 minutes at 48\u00b0C, followed by RT inactivation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C. real-time PCR procedures were performed as described previously. samples were assayed in duplicate in a 25 l reaction mixture. 'no bacterial infection', 'possible bacterial infection' and 'proven bacterial infection' were defined as the presence of fewer than two, two to three, and more than three of the above criteria. an unpaired t test was used to compare means. fluenzaviruses (PIVs) 1\u20133, picornaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses on LLC-MK2, RD, R-HELA and HEP-2C cells. in positive cultures, virus was identified by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to RSV types A and B, influenzaviruses A and B, PIV 1\u20133 and adenoviruses. Detection of viral and atypical pathogens was performed in parallel. real-time PCR procedures were performed as described previously. samples were assayed in duplicate in a 25 l reaction mixture. 'no bacterial infection', 'possible bacterial infection' and 'proven bacterial infection' were defined as the presence of fewer than two, two to three, and more than three of the above criteria. twenty-six PICU patients met the inclusion criteria. one patient was admitted with a positive RSV test result from an outside hospital, and no further testing was performed. at PICU 20 (87%) Deaths due to LRTI 1 A total of 23 patients were included in the study. LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; PICU, paediatric intensive care unit. viral culture identified a respiratory virus in six PICU patients. atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae could not be detected in any of the LRTI patients. in eight (35%) children more than one virus was detected. six children had a dual infection, one had a triple and one had a quadruple respiratory virus infection. the use of real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield from 48% to 96%. real-time PCR revealed multiple virus infections in 35% of patients. PCR increased the diagnostic yield by up to 25% as compared with conventional techniques. rhinovirus [23] and coronavirus [14] are well recognized as causes of the common cold. on the other hand, there is increasing evidence that they are also important causes of severe lower respiratory disease. real-time PCR will provide insight into the role played by such viruses in the aetiology of LRTI. in the PICU patients studied, we found a high prevalence of multiple viral infections (35%), including triple and even quadruple infections. in previous studies the detection of multiple infections varied considerably, ranging from 0.6% to 27%. in the latter study most coronaviruses were identified as part of multiple virus infections. real-time PCR for a broad range of respiratory viruses was found to be highly sensitive in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection in the PICU. real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield of positive samples by twofold compared with conventional methods (viral culture and DIF) real-time PCR allows detection of multiple viral infections (found in 35%) rapidity and sensitivity of real-time PCR test results can help clinician to initiate appropriate cohorting strategies to prevent other critically ill children from acquiring nosocomial viral infections. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
