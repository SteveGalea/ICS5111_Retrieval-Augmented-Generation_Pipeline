{"summary": "Methods Setting NTUH is a 2000-bed, university-affiliated medical center located in northern Taiwan. the center provides both tertiary and primary care for patients. the center was also the primary hospital caring for SARS patients during the outbreak in Taiwan. intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered if severe leukopenia (2 x 109/L), thrombocytopenia (100 x 109/L), or both occurred. the dosage of IVIG was 1 g/kg/day for 2 days. respiratory care followed the principles suggested for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome (8). the health of healthcare workers who had contact with SARS patients was monitored daily for 14 days after the last exposure. once fever developed in a worker, he or she was immediately hospitalized and placed in isolation in a specially designated ward. a standard case report form modified from one designed by the centers for disease control and prevention for SARS was used to collect demographic and clinical data. oral ribavirin was prescribed soon after the diagnosis of SARS was made. the loading dose was 2,000 mg followed by 1,200 mg per day if the body weight was >75 kg. this treatment lasted 10 days unless adverse effects developed. etiologic workup included the sputum Gram stain and acid-fast stain, sputum culture for bacteria, sputum culture for bacteria, sputum culture for bacteria, and urine legionella antigen. other routine laboratory tests, such as the hemogram, serum AST, ALT, CK, CK, and LDH, were examined every other day during hospitalization. 76 patients were enrolled during the study period. their demographic and clinical data are detailed in Table 1. 76 patients were enrolled. three of the 24 patients who had diarrhea had previously received various antimicrobial agents. the duration from symptom onset to a patient\u2019s visiting NTUH was 1\u201312 days (median 3 days) abnormalities on chest radiography suggesting pneumonia were found in 56 of the 76 patients. aSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, AST, aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, alanine aminotransferase, CK, lactate dehydrogenase, CK, creatine kinase, CRP, C-reactive protein. eOnly 68 patients had been tested. 69 patients had respiratory distress and needed oxygen supplements. the duration from disease onset to severe diarrhea was 8.9 4.7 (SD) days. leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were found in 40, 72, and 61 patients. 7.8 4.2 days Elevated CRP (71, 93.4) 7.1 4.0 (mg/dL) 8.5 3.0 days aSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SD, standard deviation. new lesions limited to one lung lobe in 21 patients. the first patient did not receive any treatment specific for SARS. seven patients did not receive steroids because their cases were rapidly fatal after diagnosis. eight patients received pulse steroid therapy for progressive clinical conditions, with the usual dosage of steroids. complications developed in 18 patients during hospitalizations. rhabdomyolysis, peripheral neuropathy, acute renal failure, and fungal or bacterial superinfection. some patients experience more than one bacterial superinfection. the overall death rate was 19.7% (15/76) among the 14 patients whose underlying diseases were classified as ultimately fatal or rapidly fatal, the rate of death was 78.6% (11/14) the time from disease onset to death in these 15 patients was 4\u201342 days (median 12 days) the time from disease onset to death in these 15 patients was 4\u201342 days (median 12 days). seven of the 12 patients became afebrile again and had no fever 1\u20132 days after the transient rebound of fever without specific intervention. the other five patients received further pulse steroid therapy to control the fever and exacerbate clinical symptoms. cFactors that remained statistically significant after multivariate analysis for death. 76 patients with probable SARS with pneumonia demonstrated a high case-fatality rate (19.7%), especially in patients with major underlying diseases. more patients in our case series initially had diarrhea (31.6% vs. 1%\u201319.6%) therefore, according to our observations, diarrhea may be considered as an early symptom and clue for SARS. 18 patients had initial symptoms of diarrhea when fever occurred. the overall death rate in our study was similar to that reported from Hong Kong (7%\u201320.9%) (3,5). the best timing of starting steroid usage and the total duration of steroid usage in SARS patients remain unclear. the discovery of CRP was reported in 1930 by Tillet and Francis (17) CRP parallels the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a useful marker for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery. all our patients with severe underlying disease were older (age >65 years) lysis was found in three patients. acute myocardial infarction occurred in a patient who had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease."}
