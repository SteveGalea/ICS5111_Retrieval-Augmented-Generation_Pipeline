{"summary": "antigen targeting to DCs induces humoral immunity. mice were immunized with either DEC-205/OVA adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) and CpG (DEC-205/OVA), BPPcysOVAMPEG or soluble OVA (OVA + BPPcysMPEG) OVA-specific serum IgG titres on day 27 and day 42. results are compiled from three independent experiments. OVA-specific IL-4- and IFN-secreting T cells were evaluated by ex vivo stimulation of splenocytes from immunized mice with the dominant OVA MHC-I and -II peptides. the highest number of cytokine producing T cells was observed in this group. IL-4 (A) or IFN (B), (C) spot forming units/106 splenocytes following stimulation with the indicated OVA-peptides on day 42. bars represent the mean SEM (n = 5, triplicates from pooled animals) of three independent experiments. antigen targeting to DCs induces IFN-producing memory CD8+ T cells in the liver. a hepatotropic adenovirus challenge model was used. mice were infected with a recombinant adenovirus. liver lymphocytes were analysed by flow cytometry 4 days after infection. bars represent proportions of CD44highCD8+ and CD44highCD8+ cells. release of IFN by CTLs has been shown to mediate non-cytolytic clearance of infected hepatocytes. infection of all OVA-immunized groups led to drastic histological lesions in the liver, hepatocellular cell death and marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the tissue. automated multidimensional fluorescent microscopy on liver sections revealed no significant differences in the hepatic composition of leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, B cells and T cell subsets among the groups. mice were immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 either with DEC-205/OVA/OVA/CpG or BPPcysOVAMPEG and challenged with Ad-GFP-luc or adenovirus control. on day 4 after adenovirus infection, livers were harvested for MELC analysis. n = 3 with 2\u20134 fields of view were measured per animal. n = 3 with 2\u20134 fields of view were measured per animal. infection with the Ad-GFP-luc control virus did not affect serum ALT levels. significantly lower ALT concentrations (330 U/l) were measured in immunized mice. antigen delivery to DCs induces CTLs that clear virus infected hepatocytes. strong luciferase activity was detectable in the liver of all mice infected with the control Ad-GFP-luc virus. luciferase activity in the livers of immunized and AdOVA-GFP-luc infected mice was significantly reduced in dec-205/OVA vaccinated mice. direct contact (9 m) to AdOVA-GFP-luc infected hepatocytes in DEC-205/OVA immunized mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized group. despite lower abundance of CD8+ T cells being in intimate contact with virus infected cells, substantially more of them were found to be closely associated with active caspase-3 and thus apoptotic cells in the liver. antigen targeting to DCs induces IgG responses of distinct kinetics and subtype distribution. Mice (n = 5) were immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 with DEC-205/OVA. we then compared OVA-specific serum IgG1 and IgG2c titres. either dec-205/OVA, OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG or BPPcysOVAMPEG induced a rather balanced IgG1/IgG2c ratio. neither the injection of the adjuvant BPPcysMPEG alone, nor the vaccination with the immunodominant CD4+ and CD8+ OVA peptides without adjuvant did induce humoral immunity. peptide targeting to DCs did not induce IFN-producing T cells. mice were immunized days 0, 14 and 28 with peptides adjuvanted with BPPcysMPEG. IL-4 (A) or IFN (B), (C) spot forming units/106 splenocytes. we evaluated OVA-specific CTL activity in vaccinated mice. no lysis of target cells was detectable in this group. antigen delivery to DCs induced a weak and balanced Th1 (IFN) and Th2 (IL-4) cell response. cells express EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and luciferase. infection of deC-205 mock-immunized mice with AdOVA-GFP-luc did not lead to an accumulation of CD44highCD8+ T cells in the liver. an accumulation of intrahepatic CD44highCD8+ T cells was detected in all other experimental groups following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection. hardly any IFN production was detected in the hepatic CD44-CD8+ T cells. dec-205/OVA vaccination resulted in an exceptionally strong accumulation of IFN-producing CD44highCD8+ effector memory T cells in the liver following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection. sections revealed no significant differences in the hepatic composition of leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, B cells and T cell subsets among the groups. the observed type of immunopathology in DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice was indicative for acute hepatitis as a consequence of the immune-mediated clearance of virus infected hepatocytes. dec-205/OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG or BPPcysOVAMPEG challenged with AdOVA-GFP-luc or adenovirus control. n = 3 with 2\u20134 fields of view were measured per animal. serum concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) were determined in vaccinated and adenovirus-challenged animals. infection with the control virus did not affect serum ALT levels in any of the experimental groups. data represent mean values before and after adenovirus challenge. two-way RM Anova (*p 0.05; ***p 0.001) or paired, two-tailed t-test comparing values from day 0 and 4 within the respective group. dec-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice showed differences in the distance of CD8+ T cells to virus infected hepatocytes. despite lower abundance of CD8+ T cells being in intimate contact with virus infected cells, substantially more of them were found to be closely associated with active caspase-3 and thus apoptotic cells in the liver of dec-205/OVA immunized mice. in vivo antigen delivery to CD8+ cross-presenting DCs is highly effective in inducing antiviral immunity in the liver. this approach tended to promote a more robust viral clearance as well as slightly less pronounced hepatocellular cell death and pro-inflammatory effect. despite lack of viral eradication in the vaccinated group, these mice showed marked immunopathology and elevated ALT levels following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection. antigen-specific recognition of the virus by IFN+CD44+CD8+ T cells results in cytokine release followed by innate immune activation. immunization with hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particles co-administered with BPPcysMPEG resulted in a Th2 dominated cytokine profile. however, the adjuvant dose, the route of administration and the intrinsic features of the antigen may account for the observed differences in the T helper cell phenotype. targeting DEC-205+ DCs resulted in high frequency of local IFN+CD44+CD8+ memory T cells. one critical point in fighting viral infections is to keep balance between protective immunity and immunopathology. only in the DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG group could immunopathology be correlated with antigen-specific viral clearance in the liver. new studies are needed to clarify whether DEC-205/OVA vaccination using polyICLC/CpG will be as efficient as (or even more efficient than) DEC-205/OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG vaccination in inducing antiviral immunity in the liver. non-canonical CTL effector function where CTLs are stimulated by cross-presenting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. TNF induces cell death specifically in infected hepatocytes involving caspase-3 activation following TNFR stimulation. ko mice behave exactly the same as wildtype mice with regards to antiviral immune response against adenovirus infected hepatocytes. this does not exclude that high levels of IFN may enhance secondary antiviral effects. a hallmark of e.g. HCV persistence is the appearance of functionally impaired and exhausted T cells. antibodies, antigens and cell lines EndoGrade OVA were obtained from Hyglos (Germany) peptides CD4323\u2013339 (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR) and CD8257\u2013264 (SIINFEKL) were synthesized at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (Germany) molar mass was determined as 1:7 (DEC-205/OVA:BPPcysOVAMPEG), 1:12.5 (OVA + BPPcysMPEG:BPPcysOVAMPEG) and 1:1.7 (OVA + BPPcysMPEG:DEC-205/OVA) TLR ligands Poly(I:C) and CpG were purchased from Invivogen (Germany) 75 l peripheral blood were mixed with 25 l 1% heparin (Ratiopharm, Germany), centrifuged (10,600 g, 10 minutes, room temperature) and 32 l of the supernatant were used for ALT quantification using the scil Reflovet\u00ae Plus reflection-photometer. analysis of liver lymphocytes Livers were perfused with ice-cold PBS and minced on ice followed by enzymatic digestion in IMDM antibody binding was detected using biotin-conjugated goat -mouse IgG, goat -mouse IgG1 and goat -mouse IgG2c antibodies (1 hour, 37 \u00b0C) antibody binding was detected using biotin-conjugated goat -mouse IgG1 and goat -mouse IgG2c antibodies. ABTS in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.35) was added to each well and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded after 30 minutes of incubation. endpoint titres were expressed as the reciprocal value of the last serum dilution which yielded an absorbance two times above negative controls. control animals received PBS and were either mock-infected (PBS) or infected with AdOVA-GFP-luc28. lysates were mixed with Luciferase assay Reagent II.
