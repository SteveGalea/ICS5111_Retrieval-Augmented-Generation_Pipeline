{"summary": "pteropid bats constitute approximately one fifth of the world's mammalian species. they are known colloquially as fruit bats or flying foxes. their capacity for long-distance dispersal through flight has undoubtedly contributed to their widespread distribution across tropical and sub-tropical Asia and Australia. the increasing incidence of HeV, combined with its high fatality rate, means HeV has the potential to cause further significant disease outbreaks in Australia and abroad. unlike HeV, Cedar virus caused no clinical disease in experimentally infected ferrets and guinea pigs [10] despite the risk of zoonotic diseases originating in bats, little is known regarding the bat immune system. rabies-like viruses are capable of causing clinical disease in bats and humans [17], polymerisation of the IgA (and IgM) is facilitated by the joining (J) chain. polymeric IgA is secreted into the mucosa through its interaction with the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) in serum it interacts with the IgA Fc receptor (FcR) to control the inflammatory response. gG, IgM and IgA of P. alecto reveal a diverse repertoire of variable heavy chain transcripts. transcripts resembling IgE have also been indentified in different bat species, while IgD appears specific to only insectivorous bats. early studies have demonstrated pronounced differences in both the magnitude and duration of antibody responses in bats compared to other mammals. diversse isoforms of IgG and IgM suggestive of multiple subclasses were identified. reagents developed within this study will aid future studies of this unique immunoglobulin repertoire. oglobulin genes are designated IGHG, IGHA, IGHM, IGJ and PIGR for IgGH, IgAH, IgMH,the joining chain and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor respectively. the purification strategy employed in this study exploited the molecular characteristics of isotypes of mammalian immunoglobulins. Isolation of IgG from human, rabbit and P. alecto sera was performed using immobilised Protein A, G or L. serum samples were diluted 5-fold in binding buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and loaded on to columns equilibrated with the binding buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. the reactions were stopped by addition of 30 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the optimal digestion conditions obtained for bat IgG were used for digestion of 20 mg of IgG in scaled-up experiments. Rabbit anti-Fab antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography. the purified antibodies, designated anti-Fab-specific antibodies (4 mg), were coupled to a HiTrap activated HP column. purification of P. alecto IgM and IgA IgG-depleted P. alecto serum and plasma samples were obtained by repeated (2\u20133 times) affinity chromatography. protein bands corresponding to heavy chain subunits of immunoglobulins were electroeluted from the gel using a bio-Rad mini Whole Gel Eluter. eluted fractions were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE, pooled and used for production of specific antiserum in rabbits. serum samples (15 g) were analysed by 2-DE as described previously. membranes were either visualized by silver nitrate or western transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes in 10 mM CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol for immunoblot analysis. stramonium agglutinin (DSA; 13,000 dilution), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA; 13,000), Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA; 130,000), peanut agglutinin (PNA; 11,000) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I; 11,000) were washed three times in TBS-T for 10 min peptides were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) system connected directly to the nano-spray ion source of an LCQ Classic quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo) as previously described. results were filtered by a single threshold where matches to peptides were reported only if the sequest animals were bled for serum and plasma and then euthanized for dissection of tissues. Tissues were stored at 80\u00b0C in RNAlater (Ambion) for RNA analysis or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for downstream mass spectrometry (MS) whole immunoglobulin proteins are designated as either IgG, IgA and IgM. contant regions for IgGH, IgAH and IgMH are designated C, C and C. reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation of respective heavy chains was determined by comparing tandem mass spectrometric data. light blue boxes represent those components which polyclonal antiserum was raised against. the papain digest was concentrated 5-fold to 200 l using ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices with a 5 kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane. the concentrate was diluted with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 50 mM cysteine and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Fab and rabbit anti-Fab antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography. they were coupled to a 1 ml HiTrap NHS-activated HP column. the purified antibodies, designated anti-Fab-specific antibodies (4 mg), were coupled to an immobilised Protein G affinity column. affinity chromatography media reported to specifically interact with mammalian IgA, including Jacalin [39], Peptide M [40] and staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 7 [41] were also used in attempts to purify P. alecto IgA from serum, plasma and tissue lavages. SDS-PAGE, 2-D electrophoresis (2-DE) and immunodetection Protein fractions were analysed using reducing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in precast gels. protein bands were visualized after staining with either Coomassie Brilliant blue (CBB) or silver nitrate. samples were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and western transferred onto low fluorescence PVDF transfer membranes. they were then blocked overnight in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.25% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS-T) after washing 3 times with TBS-T, membranes were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated lectins. the cell phase consisted of 50 mM Na2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. elastic fractions were manually collected and subjected to analysis by reducing SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. peptides were analysed by mass spectrometry of bands excised from CBB-stained bands from reducing SDS-PAGE gels. total RNA was extracted from lymph node, spleen, liver, lung, heart, kidney, small intestine, brain and salivary gland as previously described. qPCR reactions were preformed in triplicate as described previously. washing removed significantly more IgG from the immobilised Protein A column. IgGH was approximately 50\u201352 kDa. a light chain immunoglobulin of approximately 25 kDa was also visible in Protein G purified fractions. two major bands were detected by reducing SDS-PAGE in the eluate. a 66\u201370 kDa band representative of IgMH and a 25 kDa band representative of immunoglobulin light chain were excised. panel A; purification of IgM from whole serum. panel B; purified IgM fractions from serum (lane 1) and plasma (lane 3). the distribution of IgG, IgM and IgA in healthy P. alecto was examined using LC-MS/MS analysis of gel-separated proteins from various tissue extracts and secretions. no proteins of high molecular weight were detected in faeces.

IgGH antiserum reacted with a variety of IgGH isoforms. antiserum generated against P. alecto IgMH reacted with P. conspicillatus. reactivity was also detected with horse IgGH (lane 6) LC-MS/MS successfully captured whole IgG from P. alecto serum and plasma. it appeared that P. alecto IgG had greater binding affinity to Protein G than to Protein A. washing removed significantly more IgG from the immobilised Protein A column compared to Protein L. Flow through (FT) fraction contained the Fab fragment (a doublet of approximately 25 kDa) two major bands were detected by reducing SDS-PAGE in the eluate from both serum and plasma samples. gel eluted IgMH was used as antigen for production of specific polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. one fraction from serum was also shown to correspond to C. 5.6 MP5 54 IgMH (C) 8 11.8 MP6 48 IgMH (C) 2 5.4 MP7 30 Light chain 5 18.7 MP8 28 Light chain 2 15.3 J chain 4 26.6 Serum bands 1\u20138 from Figure 3B are denoted MS1 to MS8, plasma bands 1\u20138 from Figure 3B are denoted MP1 to MP8. purification of IgG and production of antiserum Commercially available immobilised Proteins G and A successfully captured whole fragments were used as antigens for production of specific polyclonal antibodies. panel A; Protein G purification. panel B; Protein A purification. Lane 1 (all panels); Mark 12 standard. four fractions from each serum and plasma were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. each fraction corresponded to C, immunoglobulin light chain and/or J chain. one fraction from serum corresponded to C. the distribution of IgG, IgM and IgA in healthy P. alecto immunoglobulins was examined using LC-MS/MS analysis of gel-separated proteins from various tissue extracts and secretions. IGHG, IGHA, IGHM, IGJ and PIGR mRNA expression levels in ten tissues collected from three individual wild-caught P. alecto fruit bats by qPCR. PIGR expressed in small intestine, lung and salivary gland. brain, heart, kidney and liver expressed very low levels of all three mRNAs. IGHG was most abundant in the lymph node, spleen and PBMC. lation status of whole P. alecto IgG and IgM was assessed by treatment with glycosidases and lectin binding. electrophoretic analysis of immunoglobulin subunits revealed greater glycan content associated with IgM molecules than IgG. this observation was confirmed by staining of IgG and IgM with a glycan specific stain. reactivity with MAA II and SNA indicated presence of sialic acid residues. treatment with PNA and UEA I indicated presence of galactose and fucose residues. these tests were less conclusive, possibly due to incomplete deglycosylation or nonspecific binding of lectins. panel C and D, 2-DE separation of P. alecto serum sample probed with rabbit antiserum against P. alecto IgMH (panel C) and IgGH (panel D). reactivity of IgGH and IgMH antiserum Serum proteins for a number of species were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE. no proteins of high molecular weight were detected in faeces. IgMH was detected in all samples with the exception of tears. in contrast, IgMH was only detected in lung lavage while IgAH was identified in small and large intestine lavages, milk and tears. large intestine extract - - 3 8.6 - - Salivary gland extract - - 7 20.0 - - Milk - - 8 24.4 4 20.0 Tears - - - - 11 34.7 Samples were run on separate gels and bands were excised from the region predicted to comprise the immunoglobulin heavy chains (50\u201380 kDa) electrophoretic characterisation of P. alecto and human IgG and IgM before/after deglycosylation. bands with asterisks indicate neuraminidase and hashes indicate PNGaseF. anti-Fab antiserum reacted only with immunoglobulin light chains. IgGH antiserum reacted with a variety of IgGH isoforms ranging in pI from 5\u20139. antiserum generated against P. alecto IgMH reacted very weakly with ferret IgMH. cross-species reactivity of rabbit anti-P. alecto IgGH and IgMH. the immobilised anti-Fab antibody used in this study clearly enriched IgM from IgG depleted P. alecto serum. however, no visible enrichment of IgA was observed. LC-MS/MS analysis detected IgA in the small and large intestine lavages, milk and tears. absence of IgA in the lung lavage and salivary gland may be the result of differential regulation of either IgA itself or the J-chain or pIgR. in humans the majority of IgG is transferred to the fetus via the placenta. other species, such as cows, sheep and horses do not transfer IgG across the placenta. a smaller proportion of IgA is provided to the newborn through the colostrum and milk. a doublet of slightly different molecular weights for the IgGH chain was also observed after 1-DE immunoblotting. most mammalian species contain multiple IgG subclasses. however, a much smaller number of reactive IgMH isoforms were detected in serum following 2-DE western blotting. P. alecto IgGH antiserum cross reacted strongly against two other bats and horse IgGH. a close evolutionary relationship between chiroptera bats and horse has been reported on several occasions. deglycosylation of IgMH and 2-DE immunoblotting of IgGH revealed the possible existence of multiple IgMH and IgG subclasses in P. alecto. this study suggests healthy P. alecto bats have considerably less serum IgA than expected. further research is required to investigate the functional relevance of this unique antibody repertoire.
