{"summary": "cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications. all patients underwent disease assessment with bone marrow evaluations immediately before CTI. the study included 3 stages designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of CAR T cells. antimicrobial prophylaxis commenced with chemotherapy. CRS was defined using the MSKCC grading criteria (Table 1). CRS grade 0\u20132 was considered mild, whereas grade 3 was considered severe. neurotoxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. predictors with a univariate P value.25 were analyzed in a multivariate model. a timeline of documented infections occurring between the day of CTI (day 0) and day 180 was constructed for each patient. data collected from electronic medical record included demographics, prior treatment history, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, conditioning chemotherapy before CTI, antimicrobial prophylaxis, subtype and duration of leukopenia. occurrence and grade of CRS and/or neurotoxicity, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and cytokine levels, disease response, allogeneic HSCT after CTI, and survival. clinical variables analyzed included age, sex, prior lines of chemotherapy, prior allogeneic HSCT, conditioning chemotherapy, morphologic disease status (5% blasts or extramedullary involvement), CAR T-cell dose, quantitative IgG nadir, and maximum CRS grade. sex 39 (74) Race Asian 2 (4) Black 1 (2) Native American 1 (2) White 43 (81) Refused/unknown 6 (11) Disease status Prior lines of therapy, median (IQR) 3 (2\u20137) Relapse after HSCT 19 (36) Hematologic parameters before CTI ALC 300 cells/L 30 (57) Lymphopenia duration, median (IQR), d 3 (1\u201342) ANC 500 cells/L 18 (34) Neutropenia duration, median (IQR), d the total median durations of lymphopenia and neutropenia among 53 patients were 11 (IQR, 11\u2013124) and 12 (IQR, 10\u2013117) days. the total median durations of lymphopenia and neutropenia among the 53 patients were 11 (IQR, 11\u2013124) and 12 (IQR, 10\u2013117) days. all but 4 infections occurred while the patient was neutropenic. four IFIs occurred in patients receiving micafungin prophylaxis. there were 2 viral reactivations (1 herpes simplex and 1 varicella zoster virus) eEarly bloodstream infections included 3 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 2 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli infections. single late bloodstream infection was VRE. onavirus, 2 influenza A, 4 rhinovirus/enterovirus, and 1 unknown infection. jEarly infections with nonrespiratory viruses included 1 herpes simplex virus (orolabial) and 1 varicella zoster virus (shingles) infection. 20 (83%) had low IgG levels, with a median of 415 mg/dL (IQR, 338\u2013635) and 1 patient received intravenous immunoglobulin. 10 of 32 patients (31%) had 15 infections between day 31 and day 180. of these 10 patients, 6 were hypogammaglobulinemic. BSI (adjusted HR, 19.97; P.001) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Cumulative incidence curves of time to infection and BSI within 180 days after CTI stratified by CRS grades are shown in Figure 2. all the analysis time was CRS grade 3\u20134. To examine whether serum cytokine profiles were compared to serum cytokine profiles. we first identified serum cytokines correlated with grades of CRS. we then compared the serum cytokine panels in patients with CRS who had infections with those in patients who did not but found no difference in these serum levels. the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 30\u201374 years); 39 (74%) were men, and the majority (43; 81%) were white. unknown 6 (11) Disease status Prior lines of therapy, median (IQR) 3 (2\u20137) Relapse after HSCT 19 (36) Hematologic parameters before CTI ALC 300 cells/L 30 (57) Lymphopenia duration, median (IQR), d 3 (1\u201342) ANC 500 cells/L 18 (34) Neutropenia duration, median (IQR), d 12 (3\u201383) Hematologic parameters on day of CTI ALC 300 cells/L. the total median durations of lymphopenia and neutropenia among the 53 patients were 11 (IQR, 11\u2013124) and 12 (IQR, 10\u2013117) days. the total median durations of lymphopenia among the 53 patients were 11 (IQR, 11\u2013124) and 12 (IQR, 10\u2013117) days. all but 4 infections occurred while the patient was neutropenic. four IFIs occurred in patients receiving micafungin prophylaxis. 1 case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia. eEarly bloodstream infections included 3 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and 2 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli infections. single yeast infection was Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia. arly infections with nonrespiratory viruses included 1 herpes simplex virus (orolabial) and 1 varicella zoster virus (shingles) infection. the single late infection was BK virus (hematuria) 20 (83%) had low IgG levels, with a median of 415 mg/dL. 1 patient received intravenous immunoglobulin. ten of 32 patients (31%) had 15 infections between day 31 and day 180. of these 10 patients, 6 were hypogammaglobulinemic. Cumulative incidence curves of time to infection and BSI within 180 days after CTI stratified by CRS grades are shown in Figure 2. a significant association between high-grade CRS and the risk of infection. all the analysis time was CRS grade 3\u20134. we first identified serum cytokines correlated with grades of CRS. interferon, IL-6, interleukin 10 and 15, and tumor necrosis factor. we then compared serum cytokine panels in patients with CRS who had infections with those in patients who did not but found no difference in these serum levels. bacterial infections occurred a median of 18 days (IQR, 9\u201329) after CTI, followed by fungal infections (median 23 days; IQR, 20\u201329 days) and viral infections (median 48 days; IQR, treat high-grade CRS increases the risk of infection independent of CRS. but we were not able to find a significant association in univariate analysis. a similar finding of an association between CRS and infection was recently reported in another trial of CD19-targeted CAR T cells. however, a potential mechanism underlying the association between high-grade CRS and infection is unclear. no cases of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis and rare herpetic viral reactivations. bacterial infections occurred a median of 18 days after CTI. fungal infections occurred at a median of 23 days. the majority of patients received micafungin prophylaxis (100 mg intravenously daily) this finding is comparable to 8.6% rate of proven or probable IFI in the micafungin prophylactic arm. it remains to be seen whether patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy can be better stratified. the epidemiology of infections along with susceptibility patterns may differ from that in other centers. infections are common in adults with relapsed B-ALL after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and can co-occur during times of CRS."}
