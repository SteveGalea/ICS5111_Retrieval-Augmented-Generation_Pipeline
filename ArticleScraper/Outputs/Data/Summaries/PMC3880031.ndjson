{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted to analyze quality of care on childhood pneumonia in eight eastern cities in china. a predesigned case report form was used to extract data from the hospital medical records. a total of 1298 cases were collected and analyzed. intravenous use of herbal injection was higher in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals. most of the cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms without sufficient confirmation of aetiology. in china, there are an annual 21.1 million new cases of pneumonia in children under 5 years of age. the two types of hospitals have advantages and disadvantages. commonly, WM hospitals prefer to acute severe disease. TCM hospitals prefer to chronic mild disease. clinical cure was defined as temperature 37.2\u00b0C, disappearance of all symptoms except occasional cough, and disappearance of rales. failure was defined as no improvement in presenting symptoms. the hospitals are either affiliated with universities or are provincial/municipal children\u2019s hospitals. children between 1 and 14 years of age presenting to the pediatric ward with clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia were eligible for the study. clinical improvement was defined as 37.2\u00b0C, all symptoms and rales reduced. failure was defined as no improvement in presenting symptoms. aRecurrent pneumonia is defined as at least two pneumonia episodes in a 1-year period or at least three episodes over a lifetime, with normal chest radiography between each episode. cRURTI is defined as in patients age 0\u20132 years, seven or more episodes of URTI in 1 year; age 3\u20135 years, six or more episodes in 1 year; 6\u201314 years, five or more episodes of URTI in 1 year. cough (98.6%), fever (84%), rales (75.0%), and fever (74.9%) the frequencies of rales, phlegm, and fever were significantly higher in WM hospitals than in TCM hospitals (p 0.01). average duration of illness from onset of symptoms and signs to admission was markedly higher in WM hospitals than in TCM hospitals (p 0.01). aetiology diagnosis Specific pathogens (one pathogen or more) were identified in 624 (48.1%) cases. eighty-five (6.5%) cases were not tested for pathogens. bIdentified through serum antibody or antigen test. cIdentified through nasopharyngeal secretion antibody test or serum antibody test. gMissing 65 cases of etiological tests results. 320 (53.5%) underwent external application of herbs. a7 cases of gentamicin and 1case of erythrocin were identified as clinical. ly cured when discharged, a cure rate of 63.0% (Tables 5 and 6). relief rates of fever were significantly higher in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals. but the time from onset of fever to complete resolution was similar in two types of hospitals (p = 0.013) d hospitals WM hospitals ORb 95% CIc Pd AORe 95% CIf APg Fever Cured 433 524 Failed 15 64 3.5 2.0 6.3 0.01 3.7 2.0 6.8 0.01 Cough Cured 325 220 Failed 269 470 2.6 2.6 3.2 0.01 2.5 2.0 3.1 0.01 Phlegm Cured 291 247 Failed 209 104 0.6 0.4 0.8 0.01 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.01 Tachyp clinical characteristics A total of 1298 cases were collected from six TCM hospitals and seven WM hospitals. previous medical history included recurrent pneumonia, recurrent bronchitis, and recurrent upper respiratory tract infection (RURTI) in 349/1298 (26.9%) children;
