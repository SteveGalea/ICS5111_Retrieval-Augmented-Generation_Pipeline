{"summary": "in brazil, over 7% of A(H1N1)pdm09-related deaths occurred in immunocompromised individuals [2]. polymorphisms in the viral genome could enhance viral virulence [13]\u2013[18]. in south America, viruses from clades 5, 6 and 7 co-circulated [21] more than 40% of individuals who died due to the strain were infected by a variant carrying the Q293H mutation. however, the ESH strain has been found in some mild cases [14], [15], [20], reinforcing the fact that host-specific factors could also account for influenza-related clinical outcomes [22]. nasopharyngeal swabs (NPAs) from 11 patients were collected. 9 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. 73 sequenced samples with completed clinical information. RNA was eluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mM EDTA (TE buffer) and stored at 70\u00b0C. RNA was used for one-step real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza subtyping according to the world health organisation (WHO) recommendations. virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and enterovirus performed according to manufacturer's instructions. virus isolation was performed in either 9-day-old embryonated eggs or in MDCK cells. RNA from patient's NPAs was extracted and subjected to one-step RT-PCR. the products were analysed in an ABI Prism 3130XL genetic analyser (Life technologies) the dataset generated was assembled in Sequencher 5.0 software (GeneCodes Corporation, Michigan, USA) with a HA reference sequence, A/California/4/2009. of note, H1 numbering was used for HA throughout this study. patients and data collections Samples and clinical data from the 2009 pandemic were sent to our laboratory as part of the influenza surveillance (Brazilian National Influenza Center/WHO) from June to August 2009, nasopharyngeal swabs (NPAs) from 11 patients were collected. of these patients, 9 had a confirmed diagnosis of A(H1N1)pdm09 (Table 1).

RNA was used for one-step real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza subtyping according to the world health organisation (WHO) recommendations. za HA sequencing The influenza HA gene was sequenced by Sanger protocol. RNA from patient's NPAs was extracted (viral RNA mini kit; Qiagen, CA) and subjected to one-step RT-PCR using superscript III and Platinum Taq with previously described primers. the amplified RT-PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life technologies, CA) Statistical analysis Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population. non-imunocompromised individuals with mild outcome or otherwise healthy adults with severe/fatal outcomes were performed using OpenEpi software. a strain with wild-type (WT) residues K-15 and Q293, and mutant P83S, was found in 7 patients. in another patient, a strain with wild-type residues K-15 and Q293, and mutant P83S, was detected (KSQ strain; patient 2 in Table 1). despite that, these patients displayed mild symptoms of infection, and hospitalization was not required. compared exposure to the virus carrying the three polymorphisms, ESH strain, as a risk factor to lead to different outcomes in post-BMT patients. a viral strain without the three polymorphisms would be a viral strain without the three polymorphisms. despite that, there is a greater tendency of ESH-infected post-BMT patients progress to mild clinical infection than non-immunocompromised individuals. despite that, there is a greater tendency of ESH-infected post-BMT patients progress to mild clinical infection than non-immunocompromised individuals. post-BMT patients had a median age of 22 years (ranging from 9 to 40 years) males accounted for 67% of the individuals. patients who underwent BMT before or within 6 months of A(H1N1)pdm09 diagnosis were stratified because this time frame is critical for immunosuppression after BMT [27] m09 HA sequences from post-BMT patients with those from Lee et al [15] and other control groups are shown (Figure 1). phylogenetic tree of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses sequenced from patients who underwent BMT. the scale bar indicates the number of amino acid changes per site. comparisons between ESH and KSQ strains correlation with disease severity could still be feasible. 21 cases were from healthy individuals, with registered information about absence of any comorbidity. among healthy individuals, 3 had mild infection (no ESH virus detected), 13 had severe infection (5 ESH viruses) and 5 deceased (1 ESH virus) post-BMT with mild outcome healthy individuals with severe or fatal outcomes * P values ESH 8 6 0.0088 KSQ 1 12 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains (residues -15, 83 and 293) Post-BMT with mild outcome non-immunocompromised with mild otcome *P values were determined by Fischer's exact test, values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Glinsky et al. and Potdar et al. [13] found an exceedingly high prevalence of Q293H mutation in individuals that deceased. clade-6 viruses possess mutations in genes other than HA, which could naturally influence its virulence. investigators working on the molecular epidemiology/surveillance of influenza could debate critical mutations in the strain."}
