{"summary": "PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Rodartevirus, the family Arteriviridae, and the order Nidovirales (3). the PRRSV genome is 15.4 kb in length and contains at least 11 open reading frames (ORFs) PRRSV interferes with the induction and function of IFN by using an N protein or nsps (10, 11) PRRSV blocks nuclear translocation of STAT 1 and STAT2, leading to the inhibition of IFN-activated JAK-STAT signaling (12). however, the mechanisms of immune evasion by PRRSV have not been fully characterized. SOCS1 and SOCS3 strongly suppressed TLR7-mediated type I IFN production. previous studies indicated that SOCS protein expression is classically induced by cytokines, especially type I IFNs. CS1 affected PRRSV replication as well as the underlying mechanism of SOCS production. PRRSV-induced SOCS1 production was not due to classical IFN signaling but required p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways. m.nih.gov/nuccore/KX766378.1) and the NADC30-like strain HNhx (GenBank ID: KX766379, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KX766379) were previously isolated by our laboratory in 2007 and 2016, respectively, in china (45\u201347) the low-pathogenic PRRSV strain BJ-4 (GenBank ID: AF33 FN- and IFN- were purchased from PBL Assay Science and PeproTech.

AP-1 binding site in porcine SOCS1 promoter is indispensable for SOCS1 transcription. AP-1 binding site in porcine SOCS1 promoter was important for PRRSV-induced SOCS1 promote. porcine AMs were pretreated with a specific c-Jun inhibitor (SR11302) for 1 h prior to HN07-1 infection. twenty-four hours later, SOCS1 mRNA expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR. no concentrations of the inhibitor caused detectable cell death in porcine AMs. the level of phosphorylation of c-Fos in Marc-145 cells was difficult to detect. both PRRSV and the N protein activate the AP-1 pathways. the AP-1 signaling pathway is involved in SOCS1 upregulation. Porcine AMs were infected with HN07-1 (MOI = 1) and harvested at the indicated time points for analysis of SOCS1, p\u2013c-Jun/c-Jun, and p\u2013c-Fos/c-Fos levels. p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways are involved in PRRSV-induced SOCS1 expression. protein levels were assessed using qRT-PCR and ELISA. the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly inhibited SOCS1 expression in porcine AMs. the ERK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on PRRSV-induced SOCS1 expression. p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and p38 inhibitor (SP600125) dose-dependently inhibited PRRSV-induced c-Fos and c-Fos phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. c-Jun activation by PRRSV is mediated through the JNK pathway and c-Fos activation is mediated through the p38 pathway. the cells were harvested for analysis of SOCS1 and p\u2013c-Jun/c-Jun expression. the cells were then transfected with plasmid that encodes the PRRSV N protein at a dose of 2.0 g per well (six-well plates) for 48 h. p38 and JNK were involved in N protein\u2013induced SOCS1 expression. PRRSV upregulation by PRRSV was not fully dependent on type I IFNs. it was involved in p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways. it was further proven that NLS-2 of N protein played a critical role in SOCS1 promoter activation. i on porcine AMs or 6 and 12 hpi on Marc-145 cells exhibited slightly decreased effects (Fig. 1A, 1E) SOCS1 upregulation is a beneficial host response to PRRSV infection. the multifunctional PRRSV N protein is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells. the N protein suppressed IFN- expression through inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. the results show that PRRSV N protein also plays an important role in SOCS1 expression.
