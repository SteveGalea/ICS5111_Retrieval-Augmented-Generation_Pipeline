{"summary": "chemokine CXCL14 has been reported to play an important role in the progression of many malignancies. but the role of CXCL14 in colorectal carcinoma remains to be established. the effect of CXCL14 on colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation was measured by immunostaining. colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. over 1 million new cases of colorectal carcinoma are diagnosed each year. despite improved radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic regimens, almost half of the colorectal carcinoma patients relapse within 5 years of treatment. chemokines and chemokine receptors could also serve as prognostic factors for cancer outcomes. chemokines and chemokine receptors could also serve as prognostic factors. cell culture HCT116, SW620, RKO and LoVo colorectal cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD. cDNA was reversely transcribed from 1 g of total RNA in a final volume of 20 l using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers. eukaryotic expression vector was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. human colorectal cell line SW620 was transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. transfected cells were split and treated with G418 (invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) '-GCC ATA CGC GAC ATA ACC TCT GTG AAG CCA CAG ATG GGT TAT GGC-3\u2032 cells were transfected with those vectors by using a Lipofectamine. cells treated with Lipofectamine alone were used as a mock control. in vitro proliferation assays 5-Bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, was performed as previously described [24] cell proliferation assays were performed in 24-well transwell chambers. cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates at a density of 5 105, grown to preconfluence (60%) matrigel (1:3, BD) was added to the transwell membrane chambers, incubated for 4 h, and seeded with cells. Surgical specimens 265 primary colorectal tumors and 129 corresponding adjacent normal colorectal mucosa of the same subjects were collected from the patients who underwent surgical resections during 2006. immunohistochemical staining Tissues were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. all sections were evaluated by two senior pathologists (Y.X. and D.D.) the immunohistochemical staining was evaluated based on the intensity (weak = 1, intense = 2) of CXCL14 immunostaining and the density (0% = inverse, 1-50% = 1, 51-75% = 2, >76% = 3) of positive tumor cells. ified Eagle\u2019s Medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin (107 U/L) and streptomycin (10 mg/L) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber containing 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. cDNA was reversely transcribed from 1 g of total RNA in a final volume of 20 l using reverse transcriptase and random hex eukaryotic expression vector was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. human colorectal cell line SW620 was transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000. transfected cells were split and treated with G418. cells treated with Lipofectamine alone were used as a mock control. for proliferation and motility assays, cells were harvested at 48 h post transfection. cell proliferation was determined by counting number of BrdU-positive cells in eight alternative areas. cells (3000 cells/well) were resuspended in DMEM 10% FBS with 0.35% agarose and layered on top of 0.5% agarose in DMEM. each experiment was done in triplicate. Surgical specimens 265 primary colorectal tumors and 129 adjacent normal colorectal mucosa of the same subjects were collected from the patients who underwent surgical resections during 2006. the primary tumors were staged according to tumor-node-metastasis classification system of the International Union against Cancer [27]. the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min in the dark at room temperature to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. the sections were preincubated with normal fetal calf or goat serum diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight with the primary antibodies. the final scores of each sample were multiplied intensity and density. the tumors were finally determined as inverse: score = 0; low expression: score 3; high expression: score>3. if the evaluations did not agree the specimens were reevaluated. CXCL14-positive staining was observed in 54.3% (70/129) of normal colorectal mucosa samples. 85.3% (226/265) of primary CRC samples. sporadic positive staining was also observed in colorectal tumor tissues. bar, 50 m. B, CXCL14 expression was plotted using the immunohistochemical scores in each carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. C, CXCL14 expression scores were shown as box plots, with the horizontal lines representing the median; the bottom and top of the boxes representing the 25th and 75th percentiles. the level of CXCL14 expression was significantly correlated with tumor progression. bar, 50 m. B, poorly differentiated colorectal tumors showed stronger immunoreactivity of CXCL14 than moderately and well differentiated colorectal tumors. 6.2%) 12 (13.2%) 34 (25.2%) 30 (22.2%) Age 0.878 0.878 Mean SD 62.4 13.5 63.7 14.1 58.7 14.7 59.5 14.0 Median 65 64 61 62 Range 25\u201388 35\u201382 25\u201384 29\u201388 TNM stage 0.674 0.165 p I 7 (7.7%) 1 (1.1%) p II 62 (68.1%) 21 (23.1%) p III 66 (48.9%) 61 (45.2%) p IV 0.191 Colon 27 (29.7%) 13 (14.3%) 34 (25.2%) 41 (30.4%) Rectum 42 (46.2%) 9 (9.9%) 34 (25.2%) 26 (19.3%) analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method revealed a significant decrease in disease-free survival of high CXCL14-expressing patients compared with low CXCL14-expressing patients. comparison was made of groups with high CXCL14 and low CXCL14 expression. comparison was made of groups with high CXCL14 and low CXCL14 expression. CXCL14 expression was inversely correlated with survival time of the patients after surgery. patients with strong CXCL14 expression showed significantly decreased overall survival. the overall survival curves were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method. factors that were significant in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. patients with stage III CRC were divided into low-CXCL14-expressing tumor group (n = 66) and high-CXCL14-expressing tumor group (n = 61) protein levels were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting in several colorectal cancer cell lines. D, CXCL14 was stably over-expressed in the SW620 subclones (clone 1 and clone 2). we performed a colony formation assay in 6-well plates. results showed that the two subclones yielded increased colonies compared with control cells. treatment with rhCXCL14 protein could promote SW620 cell proliferation. treatment with rhCXCL14 protein also accelerated SW620 cell migration and invasion. shRNA-mediated inhibition of CXCL14 expression in HCT116 cells caused a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion. strong CXCL14 staining was observed in 54.3% (70/129) of normal colorectal mucosa samples, while partially in the normal mucosa. high CXCL14 immunoreactivity was also found in colorectal cancer tissues. the same patients showed little detectable CXCL14 immunoreactivity in the normal colorectal mucosa. the colorectal tumor showed intense CXCL14 immunostaining in the cytoplasm of the tumor. 57 were well-differentiated, 140 moderately and 29 poorly differentiated. correlated with tumor size (P = 0.001, P = 0.003 for early-stage (I/II) colorectal carcinoma and late-stage (III/IV) colorectal carcinoma. no apparent correlation between CXCL14 expression and other clinical factors was observed.

C, endogenous CXCL14 mRNA and protein levels were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting in several colorectal cancer cell lines. E-G, proliferation of SW620 cells stably expressing CXCL14 or mock vector was compared by BrdU incorporation assay (E), MTT assay (F), and colony formation assay (G), respectively. PCR and Western blotting confirmed that CXCL14 was stably over-expressed compared with mock control. the results showed that the two subclones yielded increased colonies compared with control cells. treatment with rhCXCL14 protein could promote SW620 cell proliferation. the number of migrated (C) and invaded (D) cells from five random fields were counted and presented with cell numbers. the number of migrated (C) and invaded (D) cells from five random fields were presented with cell numbers. ELR chemokine with yet uncharacterised receptor has been reported to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis. this is the first study that analyzes the expression of CXCL14 protein in colorectal carcinoma by immunohistochemistry using surgically resected neoplastic tissues. in early stage I colorectal cancer, CXCL14 expression was up-regulated compared with adjacent normal mucosa. colorectal carcinoma was an independent risk factor for developing recurrence. the level of CXCL14 expression in patients with stage III/IV colorectal carcinomas was inversely correlated with duration of survival. tumors with high CXCL14 expression had a worse prognosis, even within the same clinicopathologic stage. levels and Ki67 in human colorectal cancer suggest that CXCL14 enhanced malignant colorectal cell proliferation in vitro. rhCXCL14 was shown to enhance the proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. findings consistent with previous studies that implicated altered chemokine expression levels as an indicator of progression to tumorigenesis and metastasis capacity. but few studies have reported the potential of CXCL14 in colorectal carcinoma initiation and progression. a series of topics worthy of further studies are suggested by the present findings. results provide the first definitive immunohistochemical evidence that CXCL14 expression is up-regulated in colorectal cancer. on the one hand, CXCL14 could be used as a prognostic factor for poor disease outcome. on the other hand, our studies suggest that CXCL14 expression may be beneficial for individualizing treatment options for CRC patients. the antibody (ProteinTech) to CXCL14 was pre-incubated with recombinant human CXCL14 (PeproTech) for 1 h prior to applying to tissues. some samples were randomly selected and immunostaining experiments were done using both Proteintech\u2019s and Abcam\u2019s anti-CXCL14 antibodies. statement of translational relevance This paper provides the first definitive immunohistochemical evidence that CXCL14 expression is up-regulated in colorectal cancer. on the one hand, CXCL14 could be used as a prognostic factor for poor disease outcome."}
