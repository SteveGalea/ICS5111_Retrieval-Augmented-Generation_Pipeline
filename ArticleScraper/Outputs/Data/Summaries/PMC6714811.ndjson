{"summary": "outbreaks caused by emergent and reemergent pathogens are seemingly more frequent, have global impact, and cause intense public concern. zoonosis plays a major role in the genesis of some of these novel pathogens, as revealed using rapid, high-resolution, and cost-effective genomics technologies. zoonotic transmission of simian adenoviruses (SAdV) and subsequent genome recombination with HAdV have led to the emergence and establishment of novel HAdV types. HAdV-E4 was one of the first human adenoviruses cultured and characterized (9) with what is essentially a chimpanzee SAdV genome, HAdV-E4 remains a major human respiratory pathogen the genome of HAdV-B76 has nearly complete identity to two recently sequenced SAdV genomes that were isolated from stools of apparently healthy hosts. the HAdV-B76 nucleotide sequence is 99.5% and 99.6% identical to counterparts from SAdV-B35.1 and SAdV-B35.2. species B1) and HAdV-B14 (subspecies B2) noted for reference. penton base is 100% identical among the three counterparts. hexon protein, site of the epsilon epitope responsible for serum neutralization (SN), shows highest sequence similarity with HAdV-B21 (98.1%) 2.6 100 SAdV-B27.1 Chimpanzee 97.2 86.1 57.5 57.8 56.8 HAdV-B16 Human 99.3 98.1 54.3 55.7 51.7 HAdV-B7 Human 85.5 86 53.6 53.6 53.8 HAdV-B14 Human 91.8 89.6 51.8 51.3 52.9 a comparison of representative HAdV-B76 proteins to their homologs in select adenoviruses a detailed query for lateral genomics transfer in the HAdV-B76 genome sequence was completed using Simplot. bootscan plots are presented for the hexon gene (Fig. 1C) and the fiber gene (Fig. 1D) for higher-resolution views. penton base contains sequences from unknown (yet to be reported and/or sequenced) adenovirus(es) as SAdV-B21 appeared to contribute sequences throughout the SAdV-B35 genome, it is likely the ancestral genome to which the other viruses contributed. hexon bootscan profile shows HAdV-B21 providing the variable regions, loops 1 and 2, comprising the SN epitope. a whole-genome phylogeny analysis of HAdV and SAdV genomes is shown in Fig. 2. this group of genomes was chosen to place into context the relationships between HAdV-B76, SAdV-B35.1, and SAdV-B35.2 (red lettering) and other SAdV and HAdV genomes. phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome data using neighbor-joining. maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony algorithms all reveal similar well-resolved phylogenetic relationships. a neighbor-joining bootstrap-confirmed phylogenetic tree was generated following multiple sequence alignment using the MAFFT software. the next nearest genome is a subclade of SAdV-B21 (bootstrap value, 100), and these four are separated from the next nearest genome, SAdV-B27 (bootstrap value, 100) HAdVs comprising the respiratory pathogens of species B1, including HAdV-B21, are clustered in a separate subclade from these SAdVs and HAdV-B76 (bootstrap value, 100) phylogenetic analysis of penton base genes showed HAdV-B76 as indistinguishable from both SAdV-B35.1 and -B35.2, but HAdV-B27 forms a branch with a higher bootstrap value (97), as does SAdV-B21. HAdV-B76 is in a subclade with both SAdV-B35.1 and -B35.2. however, HAdV-B16 is also contained within the subclade. the fiber appears to be recombinant via pairwise genome alignments. HAdV-B76 is historically intriguing for two reasons. it was a human pathogen that emerged in association with a fatal infection. it was serotyped, unusually, as two distinct HAdVs. its nonstandard name (\u201c21 + 16H16\u201d) reflected the latter feature. HAdV-B76, SAdV-B35.1, and HAdV-B35.2 contain identical amino acid sequences in these regions, except at one amino acid (SAdV-B35.1; motif 2, E to K) divergent sequences contained in HAdV-B16 do not explain why HAdV-B76 is desribed in the literature to serotype as HAdV-B16. the sequences support prior hemagglutination inhibition observations that the gamma epitope of HAdV-B76 is the same as for HAdV-B16. each amino acid is color-coded to provide contrast, with dashes for alignment spacing. V-B35.1 genomes contain an NF-I motif (TGGAATGGTGCCAA) that is identical to those from HAdVs, particularly the respiratory pathogens within species B. a deletion of nucleotide (nt) 8 of the SAdV NF-I sequences may represent an adaptation to the human host. tide sequence is 99.5% and 99.6% identical to counterparts from SAdV-B35.1 and SAdV-B35.2, respectively. the genome near identity of HAdV-B76 to SAdV-B35.1 and SAdV-B35.2 is remarkable, as the human virus was isolated in 1965 (27). HAdV-B16 is also reported to cross-react strongly by SN (27, 29) but shows a lower sequence similarity (84.7%) all viruses listed in Table 1 should also neutralize HAdV-B76. this has implications in the use of SAdVs in place of HAdVs as vectors for vaccines and gene therapy. the shaft was analyzed separately from the gamma epitope and cell tropism determinant knob. the fiber protein was analyzed in two parts, corresponding to the shaft and the knob, which contains the gamma epitope (28). the next closest is SAdV-B21, with 72.6% and 100% sequence similarity. HAdV-B16 (fiber; human host), HAdV-B21 (penton base and hexon; human host), SAdV-B21 (3\u2032-proximal genomics region and 5\u2032-distal genomics region; chimpanzee host) in the genome of HAdV-B76. a region of low sequence similarity in the whole-genome profile indicates that a 5\u2032 genomic region between the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) and HAdV-B76 was analyzed using software (http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/simplot/simplot/) the results are consistent with lateral transfers of genomics regions from SAdV-B27, HAdV-B21, and HAdV-B16 into the genome chassis of SAdV-B21. a whole-genome phylogeny analysis of HAdV and SAdV genomes is shown in Fig. 2. for reference, genome-specific or gene-specific landmarks are noted above each graph. this group was chosen to place into context the relationships between HAdV-B76, SAdV-B35.1, and SAdV-B35.2 (red lettering) and other SAdVs and HAdVs. the seven human adenovirus species are contrasted by color. the HAdV-B76 and nearly identical genomes of HAdV-B35.1 and SAdV-B35.2 in red lettering. the next nearest genome is a subclade of SAdV-B21 (bootstrap value, 100) phylogenetic trees of whole-genome (A), penton base (B), hexon (C) and fiber (D) sequences are presented. the fiber gene (D) appeared recombinant, so domains were extracted using the HAdV-B76 gene sequence. base genes showed HAdV-B76 as indistinguishable from both SAdV-B35.1 and -B35.2 and HAdV-B21. hexon also showed HAdV-B76 as indistinguishable from both SAdV-B35.1 and -B35.2, but HAdV-B21 forms a branch with a higher bootstrap value (97), as does SAdV-B21. phylogenetic distribution of the shaft sequences showed HAdV-B76 forming a subclade with both SAdV-B35.1 and -B35.2. the knob sequences presented a profile in which SAdV-B21 is also contained within the HAdV-B76 subclade, essentially indistinguishable, with a bootstrap value of 28. HAdV-B76 shares identical amino acid sequences with SAdV-B35.2. HAdV-B21 shares identity or near identity across all five, consistent with its SN. however, the HAdV-B16 motifs are divergent and do not reconcile with HAdV-B76. -B76, SAdV-B35.1 and HAdV-B16 share a large insertion and two small deletions. the third and fourth rows show that SAdV-B21 sequences are identical with those of HAdV-B76 and SAdV-B35.1. HAdV-B21 sequences show divergence, consistent with the HI observations that this virus is a recombinant with a HAdV-B16 the HAdV-B76 and SAdV-B35.1 genomes contain an NF-I motif (TGGAATGGTGCCAA) that is identical to those from HAdVs, particularly the respiratory pathogens within species B. HAdV-E4 has apparently expanded beyond limited outbreaks in military venues to include larger civilian outbreaks (16, 39) three adenovirus DNA replication sequence motifs are labeled and boxed. core origin, NF-I, and NF-III are labeled and boxed. the HAdV-B76 sequence was identical to the SAdV-B35.1 counterpart and to HAdV-E4FS1. genome analyses of archived, historically intriguing pathogens provide insights into current infectious disease agents, especially zoonotic ones. retrospective genome analyses of archived samples provided the perspective that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was not uniquely or newly emergent in the 1980s but had a pedigree. HAdV-B76 genome is nearly identical to two recently isolated and sequenced genomes from a chimpanzee (SAdV-B35.1) and a bonobo (SAdV-B35.2). recombination events are multiple and include numerous adenoviruses, analogous to the genome of HAdV-D53 (44). recent examples of SAdVs that appear to have infected humans include the novel Titi monkey adenovirus. a baboon adenovirus caused an outbreak of pneumonia in captive infant baboons. a recombinant SIV genome was characterized in chimpanzees. hexon and fiber proteins are principal sites of antigenic epitopes of HAdV-B76, SAdV-B35.1 and SAdV-B35.2. hexon and fiber proteins are derived from HAdV-B21 and HAdV-B16. hexon and fiber proteins cross-react with antisera for these viruses. HAdV-B76 is predicted to be a human pathogen of concern, given isolation of nearly identical viruses in a zoo and a primate colony. a question arises as to the prevalence of HAdV-B76 in the current population. a third study of HAdV-B21 examined genomes of 20 currently circulating strains along with gene sequences of 173 archived HAdV-B21 isolates. sporadic reports include intervening periods of absence of 10 years (58) these sporadically reported HAdV respiratory pathogens are still of concern even if they appear to be presently absent from the infectious disease public health landscape. ad 21+ 16H16 was isolated in 1965 from a 6-year-old boy who died of pneumonia. this virus was among a collection of HAdVs gifted to A. Heim. genome reads for both sets were then assembled de novo using clc_novo_assemble command-line assembly software. genomes showed variation compared to selected reference sequences. manual reference extension and editing were performed based on sequencing reads. custom primers were designed using automated primer design software. coding sequences were performed using the software tool Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU) (69) with SAdV-B35.1 as a reference. genome viewer tool artemis (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/) was used to record and visualize the annotation (70). bootscan was used to complete sequence recombination assessment of the MAFFT-aligned genes (74) for genes, default parameter settings were used for window size (200 nucleotides [nt]), step size (20 nt), replicates used (n = 100), gap stripping (on), distance model (Kimura) and tree model (neighbor joining) whole genomes were analyzed in the same manner. the following settings and parameters were used for each method. (i) neighbor joining with bootstrap of 1,000 and the maximum likelihood model (MEGA), (ii) maximum parsimony with bootstrap of 1,000 and the MP search method with close-neighbor interchange (CNI) on random trees. genome sequence and annotation data were deposited into GenBank as part of bioproject number PRJNA70469. genome sequence and annotation data were deposited into geneBank as part of bioproject number PRJNA70469. genome reads for both sets were then assembled de novo using clc_novo_assemble command-line assembly software. GS-FLX and Illumina sequence data sets agreed on a variation. the reference sequence was updated to reflect the variation. manual reference extension and editing were performed based on sequencing reads. genome viewer tool artemis was used to record and visualize annotation. zPicture (http://zpicture.dcode.org) provided pairwise alignments, comparisons, and visualization of genomes. a bootscan was used to complete the sequence recombination assessment of the MAFFT-aligned genes (74) for genes, default parameters were used for the window size (200 nucleotides [nt]), step size (20 nt), replicates used (n = 100), gap stripping (on), distance model (Kimura) and tree model (neighbor joining) whole genomes were analyzed in the same manner. HAdV-A12 (AC_000005), HAdV-B7 (AY603294), HAdV-B16 (AY601636), HAdV-C5 (AC_000008), HAdV-D9 (AC_000008), HAdV-E4 prototype (AY594253), HAdV-E4FS1 (AY530876), SAdV-E25 (AC_000011), SAdV-B27.1 genome sequence and annotation data were deposited into GenBank as part of Bioproject number PRJNA70469."}
