{"summary": "a previously unrecognized novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has emerged in china. it is the first time that the novel avian-origin influenza virus has infected human beings. compared with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, it seems easier for the novel virus to transmit from animals to human. the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method allows amplification of DNA with high specificity and sensitivity at a constant temperature of 60\u201365\u00b0C. it can be carried out with a simple water bath so that a thermal cycler is not required. RT-LAMP methods have been developed to detect various RNA viruses [9]\u2013[12]. s was obtained from all patients involved in this study. a total of 80 respiratory clinical specimens were collected from suspected H7N9 patients in the acute phase of illness. synthetic RNA transcripts were then purified, quantified, mixed in equal-molar amounts. the synthetic RNA transcripts were then purified, quantified, mixed in equal-molar amounts, and ten-fold diluted ranging from 107 to101 RNA copies/l. region from nucleotide 309\u2013504 with reference to the HA gene sequence of the H7N9 virus strain A/Nanjing/1/2013 (H7N9). table 2. Details of primers used for RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP reaction and product detection RT-LAMP was carried out with a RNA Amplification Kit (RT-LAMP) in a final volume of 25 l containing 0.2 M each of the outer primers F3 and B3, 2.0 M each of the primers FIP and BIP. the reaction mixture containing distilled water was used as negative controls. dilutions of RNA were used as templates for RT-LAMP reactions. the RT-LAMP products were simultaneously detected by LFD. the specificities of the RT-LAMP-LFD assays were determined by analyzing the RNA extracts from various control viruses mentioned above. a total of 80 respiratory clinical specimens (65 pharyngeal swabs, 7 sputa, and 8 tracheal aspirates) were collected from suspected H7N9 patients in the acute phase of illness. the genomic viral RNA was extracted from 200 l of samples by using a high pure viral RNA kit. the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were amplified from the H7N9 virus strain A/Nanjing/1/2013 (H7N9) with primers containing T7 promoter sequence in the reverse sides. synthetic RNA transcripts were then purified, quantified, mixed in equal-molar amounts, and ten-fold diluted. assay spans region from nucleotide 309\u2013504 with reference to the HA gene sequence of the H7N9 virus strain A/Nanjing/1/2013 (H7N9). table 2. Details of primers used for RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP reaction and product detection RT-LAMP was carried out with a RNA Amplification Kit (RT-LAMP) in a final volume of 25 l containing 0.2 M each of the outer primers F3 and B3, 2.0 M each of the primers FIP and BIP. the reaction mixture containing distilled water was used as negative controls. RNA was extracted from culture supernatants of H7N9-infected MDCK cells. dilutions of RNA were used as templates for RT-LAMP reactions. sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP-LFD assays were determined by analyzing RNA extracts from various control viruses mentioned above. a sample was determined to be positive when either viral culture or real-time RT-PCR was positive. Totally 65 pharyngeal swabs, 7 sputa, and 8 tracheal aspirates with suspicious H7N9 infection were extracted. results showed that the 63\u00b0C temperature was the optimal reaction temperature for both the HA and NA primer sets. HA (A and C) and NA (B and D) RT-LAMP on 10-fold serial dilutions of H7N9 virus RNA. (C and D) detection using the real-time turbidimetry device. a total of 80 clinical specimens collected from suspected H7N9 patients were subjected to RT-LAMP-LFD assay with the parallel analysis by the reference methods. the results showed that, of 80 specimens, 22 were positive for both HA and NA genes as detected by RT-LAMP-LFD. the HA-positive but NA-negative specimen detected by real-time RT-PCR was further analyzed by viral culture and sequencing.
