{"summary": "the 5,000-m2 structure was built with prefabricated boards according to infectious disease unit standards. the main building is an E-shaped structure with one observation ward and two confirmed wards, containing 100 beds. the ward is divided into three areas, two zones, and two lines. the rooms are air-conditioned and include a separate bathroom with disinfectant and clean water. the facility also includes a central video camera monitoring system, a multiparameter bed-side monitoring system, and in-room ultraviolet disinfection lamps. between November 2014 and may 2015, 180 cases were admitted. of the 10 confirmed EVD cases, four died and six survived. it is important that none of the clinical staff was infected. the central monitoring system monitored the entire process from admission to discharge, but also the activities of all HCWs in the contaminated zone. during the critical steps of removing PPE, we guided the process through the monitoring system by providing instructions and reminders whenever necessary. the central monitoring system also had the ability to capture important events by videotaping. the central monitoring system provided continuous real-time monitoring of patients. our experience offers insight into optimal EVD care."}
