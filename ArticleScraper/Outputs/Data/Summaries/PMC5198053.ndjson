{"summary": "many diseases are caused by viruses such as the influenza, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or emerging viral diseases. if left untreated, some present no symptoms at all. there are many antiviral drugs that block the infection process at different stages. a potential diagnostic and therapeutic alternative novel anti-viral agents have emerged from the field of in vitro selection of nucleic acid aptamers [5,6] aptamers are single-stranded folded nucleic acids (RNA or ssDNA) able to specifically recognize a target molecule with high affinity. aptamers are single-stranded folded nucleic acids able to recognize a target molecule with high affinity. oligonucleotide library consisting of a central region with random sequence flanked by constant 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends that serve as primers. each member of the library is a linear oligonucleotide with a unique sequence that acquire three-dimensional structure depending on the experimental conditions (pH, ionic strength, etc.) these highly structured aptamers are capable of binding to the target with high affinity and specificity. iterative rounds are performed until the population is enriched with sequences that display high affinity and specificity for the target. the selected aptamers are produced by chemical synthesis and purified to a very high degree. the main advantages of aptamers over antibodies are summarized in Table 1. RNA aptamers seem to have greater flexibility when it comes to folding and acquiring tertiary structures. individual aptamers can be further modified in order to improve approachability. aptamers can be further truncated to eliminate the oligonucleotide sequences which are not important for interaction with the target. HIV infects essential cells in the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. when CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost. the body becomes more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Tombelli et al. introduced aptamers capable of detecting the HIV-1 Tat protein using biotin-streptavidin interaction. other systems target Tat protein using biosensor based on the diamond field-effect transistor (FET) technique. the outer envelope has gp120 and gp40 proteins involved in interaction with cellular receptors. integrase protein binds to dsDNA viral genome by integrase protein activity (provirus); proteases process the big pre-protein and get a mature viral particle. aptamers to HIV Genome Long terminal repeats are sequences necessary for proper expression of viral genes. RNA aptamer to HIV Proteins Aptamers to Protease (PR) inhibited more than 75% of HIV-1 production in a human cell line. the shortest RNA molecule so far described that effectively interferes with HIV-1 replication. aptamers to reverse transcriptase (RT) cooperate to convert the RNA into a double-stranded linear DNA. the aptamer was able to inhibit integrase activity with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. la et al. identified two DNA aptamers capable of forming G4 structures. these aptamers inhibited the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT in vitro with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar range. no effect was observed on cellular RNase H. the hexadeosyribonucleotide d(TGGGAG), known as Hotoda\u2019s sequence, binds specifically to the surface glycoprotein (gp 120) of HIV-1 that potently neutralized HIV-1 infectivity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. aptamers to Gag Protein Other typical therapeutic target is Gag polyprotein, because of its low variability, as compared to other sequences of HIV-1 genome. aptamer was different to the HIV-1 RNA packaging element (psi), it bound to NC region interfered with binding of psi. this aptamer displayed 20-fold inhibition in the extracellular capsid levels and reduced cellular levels of mRNA for Gag. RNA aptamers may provide novel method for inhibiting HIV replication. aptamer to nucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional cellular protein that is overexpressed in cancer cell membranes. NCL is involved in the very initial step of HIV-1 virion-cell recognition. aptamer AS1411 is a stable G-quadruplex structure. aptamer and siRNA portions are chemically appended to the 3\u2032 end of the aptamer and one of the siRNA strands. aptamer and siRNA portions are chemically synthesized and annealed via'sticky bridge'. aptamer and siRNA portions are chemically synthesized and annealed. the authors chemically synthesized a modified gp120 aptamer that was complexed with three different siRNAs (HIV-1 tat/rev and two HIV-1 host cell proteins, CD4 and TNPO3). this resulted in an effective delivery of siRNAs in vivo, knockdown of target mRNAs and potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in a humanized mouse model. pt16 RNA 5\u2032-untranslated region of HIV-1 genome [29] PR10.1, PR10.9, PR10.13, PR10.18 RNA Protease viral protein [32] T30177, T30695 DNA Integrase viral protein [35,37,38,39] 37NT DNA Reverse Transcriptase viral protein [42] aptamers 8\u20136, 8\u201310, 8\u201313 RNA Nucleocapsid viral protein [47] Hotod aptamers against HBV Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a partially double-stranded DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family classified into eight genotypes from A to H. the main element of the viral particle of HBV and also the most characterized component is the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) feng et al. have isolated individual RNA aptamers with high affinity for the recombinant truncated HBV P protein that compete with the RNA interaction. aptamer Apt.No.28 prevents nucleocapsid assembly and viral replication in the hepatic cellular line. Aptamers against HCV viral genome is a positive-strand RNA. it contains approximately 9.6 kilobases and codified for a polyprotein of around 3000 amino acids. the HCV polyprotein maturation process mediated by proteases gives rise to 10 viral proteins, four structural (C, E1, E2 and p7) and six non-structural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) aptamer against HCV core labelled with biotin, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated with HRP is applied over the surface. the platform was applied to the detection of the protein in sera from HCV-infected patients and showed a proportional relationship between amplified RNA copies and HCV core protein concentration. the new direct-acting antivirals (DAA), TVR and BOC generate a high rate of side effects, are too expensive and are also susceptible to new resistant viruses. different advances have been made based on aptamers against HCV and host cell proteins as therapy. in 2003, toulm\u00e9 et al. decided to use subdomain IIId of IRES element as an antiviral target. they selected RNA aptamer and verified that isolated aptamers inhibit HCV translation in vitro and in cell culture. aptamers recognized two different subdomains of IRES element and are at least 10 times more efficient than the parental aptamers in the inhibition of mRNA IRES-mediated translation. in vitro and in vivo IRES-mediated translation was inhibited by the chimera HH363-24 that prevented both translation and replication in a hepatic cell line. a RNA aptamer, named AP30, was able to recognize this minus-IRES region and reduce positive-strand genomic RNA synthesis [96,97]. a RNA aptamer, named AP30, was able to repress replication of HCV replic the protease activity of the protein is found in the N-terminal domain. the helicase activity is present in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. the group of Nishikawa has been working with different sets of RNA aptamers against the full-length or truncated NS3 protein to inhibit its dual-activity. amer (5\u2032-14U-NEO-III or NEO-III-14U) was added. new set of RNA aptamers were selected against the helicase domain. aptamer with greatest capability to deplete helicase activity in vivo was named aptamer #5. aptamers were selected against NS5B-55 without the C-terminal region. one of the selected aptamers, B.2, blocked RNA transcription. one of the selected aptamers, 27v, competed with positive and negative sense HCV viral RNA to bind RdRp polymerase. aptamers RNA IRES element [90,91,92] P6-n, HH363-n RNA IRES element [93,94,95] NS2-1, 2, & 3 DNA NS2 [100] 10G-1, G6-16, G6-19 RNA NS3 [101,102] G9-I, G9-II, G9-III RNA NS3 [103,104] HDV-G9-II RNA NS3 aptamers were modified with 2\u2032 hydroxyl (R\u2013OH) or fluoropyrimidines (R\u2013F) oligonucleotides were truncated and conjugated with cholesterol- or galactose-PEG molecules. the aptamers blocked RNA synthesis of HCV genome without emergence of virus escape mutant or cellular toxicity. aptamers against human papillomavirus (HPV) are an essential protein for HCV viral assembly. they repressed viral production as a result of defective assembly of virus particle without stimulation of innate immune response. new approach to inhibiting HCV viral infection has been designed. belyaeva et al. reported two RNA aptamers to E6, named F2 and F4, which induced apoptosis in cells derived from an HPV16-transformed cervical carcinoma. this aptamer was able to inhibit the interaction between E6 and PDZ1 from Magi1, while none of them inhibited E6\u2013p53 interaction or p53 degradation. Nicol et al. selected an RNA aptamer, termed A2, with high affinity to HPV-16 E7 [125]. aptamers internalized into HPV-16-transformed cells resulted in induction of apoptosis and consequent inhibition of cell proliferation. authors demonstrated that A2 disrupted the interaction between E7 and pRb in vitro. aptamer-1 and aptamer-5 mini-1 aptamer (44-mer) bind to gD protein of HSV-1 with high affinity but not the gD protein of HSV-2. aptamer-1 effectively blocked the interaction between the gD protein and the HSV-1 target cell receptor (HVEM) aptamer binds the gD protein of HSV-2 and neutralizes infection through the Nectin1 and HVEM entry receptors with IC50 of 20 nM. aptamers that prevent HSV-2 infection may also reduce the morbidity associated with HIV-1. each segment contains one or two genes that code for the 15 viral proteins. hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are used to classify influenza subtypes. the combination of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase mainly determines the host organism and the viral infectiousness. misono and Kumar selected an RNA aptamer against to HA of A/Panama/ 2007/1999 (H3N2) using SPR-based SELEX. these RNA aptamers are able to discriminate among both A and B influenza viruses [140,141] the recent advances in the development of rapid, automatic, point of care devices for the diagnosis and subtyping of influenza virus are sustained in two facts: (i) the rapid spread of influenza-associated H1N1 a single fluorescent-labelled aptamer is able to identify three different influenza viruses (influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) at the same time, by modifying operating conditions, in 20 min. the alternative approach is biosensors technology, several biosensors have been developed to detect AIV among them. the impedance-based aptasensor described by Fu et al. has the lowest detection limit, however, it requires signal amplification with labels and a prolonged detection limit [150]. the impedance aptasensor with microfluidics chips has a lower detection limit than the SPR-based aptasensor [148] and the same sensitivity as the QCM-based aptasensor [149]. the aptamer-induced inhibition of viral infection was determined by prevention of weight loss, decrease of viral load in the lungs and restriction of inflammation and cellular infiltration. the administration of the aptamer one day prior to infection (preventive treatment) was less effective, probably because the DNA is partially degraded. the binding of aptamers to the virus (20 times higher than A22) may not necessarily be sequence-specific. the aptamer length, 2D-loops and repeating sequences of C nucleotides have also been studied. NS1 has anti-interferon (IFN) properties leading to the inhibition of the host\u2019s innate immunity. NS1 is an attractive therapeutic target in the development of anti-influenza agents. one of the four effective aptamers exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses. a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) around 10 nM. a limited number of aptamers targeting host cell factors have been described. the use of a specific aptamer that activates RIG-I effectively blocks the replication of the Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. aptamers inhibit influenza virus replication of H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes at high and low multiplicity of infection and the viral polymerase\u2013eIF4GI interaction. aptamer ApPABP11 inhibits the interactions between NS1 and eIF4GI or PABP1. aptamers targeting the host factors that interact with viral proteins may potentially have a broad therapeutic spectrum. the emergence of RVFV in the Middle East, northern Egypt and the Comoros Archipelago has highlighted that the geographical range of RVFV may be increasing. the nucleocapsid protein (N) of RVFV is an RNA binding protein required for the production of viable virus because of its involvement in several stages of viral replication. binding experiments were conducted with four different aptamers. the apparent Ki values were all in the 200 nM range. these aptamers could be used to construct a sensitive fluorescence based sensor of N binding. aptamer was found to form a parallel quadruplex structure. the sequence on 5\u2032-end were necessary for the binding activity to a highly conserved loop between A and B strands of ED3. aptamer can neutralize the infections by all four serotypes of DENVs. RNA UTR fused to the S1 RNA aptamer was expressed in living mammalian cells. this allowed endogenous viral ribonucleoprotein assembly and isolation of RNPs from whole cell extract. this allowed endogenous viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly and isolation of RNPs from whole cell extract, through binding the S1 aptamer to streptavidin magnetic beads. aptamers can inhibit the function of the EBOV polymerase complex reconstituted by expression of select viral proteins. the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host factor that specifically inhibits the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), Sindbis virus (SIN) and Ebola virus [187], by targeting the viral mRNAs for degradation. nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins. both DNA and RNA aptamers against N protein have been developed with Kd of 4.93 and 1.65 nM. human immunodeficiency virus is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time AIDS [21]. gp120 viral surface protein (SU) with CD4 host cell produces a conformational change in viral protein gp41. integration can lead to either latent or transcriptionally active forms of infection. transcriptional active forms are transcript and translated forming new viral particles that dead the host cell. great efforts are being made to get sensitive, fast and simple diagnostic methods and effective therapies. aptamers have been considered an alternative or adjuvant to the chemical antiviral agents in cART to overcome these limitations. to date, highly specific, nucleic acid-based aptamers that target various parts of HIV-1 genomes have been isolated and shown to effectively suppress viral replication to apply in HIV therapy. aptamers to HIV Genome Long terminal repeats are sequences necessary for proper expression of viral genes. interference with the function of these RNA domains may seriously compromise HIV-1 viability. aptamers inhibited more than 75% of HIV-1 production in a human cell line. the virally encoded aspartyl protease (PR) is thought to occur either during or immediately after budding. in its active form, this protein is a 22 kDa homodimer consisting of two 99-amino acid long subunits each of which contributes a catalytic aspartate residue to the active site. aptamer 37NT inhibited RT from diverse primate lentiviruses with low nM IC50 values. aptamers derived from 93del and 112del were able to inhibit also HIV-1 integrase in the nanomolar range. RNA aptamers bind to the mature form of the NC protein with high affinity and compete for the packaging element (psi) RNA binding to the NC protein. authors suggested that stabilized RNA aptamer is expected to act as an inhibitor for the viral packaging. the aptamer binds to the CCR5-binding site on gp120 in a relatively CD4-independent manner. aptamers to Gag Protein Other typical therapeutic target is Gag polyprotein, because of its low variability. human CCR5 is an important co-receptor for macrophage-tropic virus expressed by T-cells and macrophages. differences in CCR5 are associated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1. AS1411 is a G-rich aptamer that forms a stable G-quadruplex structure. the major molecular target of AS1411 is NCL. the aptamer effectively inhibited HIV-1 cellular entry. the authors also demonstrated that one of these anti-gp120 aptamer-siRNA chimera is specifically taken up by cells expressing HIV-1 gp120. the attached siRNA is processed by Dicer, resulting in specific inhibition of HIV-1 replication and infectivity in cultured CEM T-cells and primary blood mononuclear cells. a DNA aptamer obtained from the conversion of a previously reported RNA aptamer could be used to deliver siRNA into CD4+ T cells specifically. this DNA aptamer was covalently conjugated to the sense strand of the siRNA targeting HIV-1 protease (HIV-PR) and the resulting DNA aptamer-siRNA chimera specifically entered into CD4+ T cells and efficiently knockdown the expression of exogenous HIV-PR gene. aptamer-siRNA chimeras (CD4-AsiCs) block gene expression in CD4+ T cells and macrophages in vitro, in polarized cervicovaginal tissue explants, and in the female genital tract of humanized mice. aptamers for development of novel anti-HIV-1 therapies. aptamers to HIV as antiviral agents (cART) can slow the progress of the disease and reduce the risk of death and disease complication. aptamers have been considered an alternative or adjuvant to the chemical antiviral agents in cART. integrase protein binds to dsDNA viral genome by LTR ends sequences and other cellular proteins forming the pre-integration complex. the integrase protein activity (PIC) is integrated in the cellular genome by the integrase protein activity (provirus); the viral RNAs are transcripted from proviral DNA and exported to cytoplasm. the shortest RNA molecule so far described that effectively interferes with HIV-1 replication. RNA aptamer is to go into the cell as DNA plasmid and get intracellular expression of RNA aptamer to block the target. the viral enzyme integrase (IN) is essential for retroviral replication. aptamers to reverse transcriptase (RT) cleaves RNA only if the RNA is part of an RNA/DNA duplex. the aptamer competed with the natural template for the binding site in the enzyme, subsequently producing inhibition of the viral replication. shorter DNA aptamers derived from ODNs 93 and 112, named 93del and 112del were able to inhibit also HIV-1 integrase in the nanomolar range. the nucleocapsid protein of HIV-1 plays an important role in the encapsidation of viral RNA. the progress of some viral infections can be prevented by inhibition of nucleocapsid synthesis. cleotide d(TGGGAG), known as Hotoda\u2019s sequence, [49,50] authors have used the sequence as a lead sequence to make a series of modifications at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the molecule. aptamers bind specifically to the surface glycoprotein (gp 120) of HIV-1 that potently neutralized HIV-1 infectivity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. aptamer showed 20-fold inhibition in extracellular capsid levels. this aptamer reduced cellular levels of mRNA for Gag. RNA aptamers may provide a novel method for inhibiting HIV replication. olin (NCL) is a multifunctional cellular protein that is overexpressed in cancer cell membranes. NCL is in cellular fractions containing the HIV genome, viral matrix and reverse transcriptase. this supports the potential role of this protein in viral entry. aptamer and siRNA portions are chemically synthesized and annealed via \u201csticky bridge\u201d [66]. the same authors chemically synthesized a modified gp120 aptamer-siRNA chimera. aptamer and siRNA portions have potent anti-HIV activities. aptamer was complexed with three different siRNAs (HIV-1 tat/rev and two HIV-1 host cell proteins, CD4 and TNPO3), resulting in effective delivery of siRNAs in vivo, knockdown of target mRNAs and potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication. a DNA aptamer obtained from the conversion of a previously reported RNA aptamer could be used to deliver siRNA into CD4+ T cells specifically. aptamers 8\u20136, 8\u201310, 8\u201313 RNA Nucleocapsid viral protein [47] Hotoda\u2019s sequence and modifications DNA gp120 viral protein [48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] B4, B40, B40t77 RNA gp120 viral protein [55,56,57,58,59] ML8.20t14-75. Srisawat and Engelke selected RNA aptamers that can bind to the LTRs of HIV-1 DNA [28]. they showed that conserved segments present in several of the aptamers could form duplexes via Watson-Crick base-pairing with preferred sequences in one strand of the DNA. those aptamers inhibited more than 75% of HIV-1 production in a human cell line. the viral enzyme integrase (IN) is essential for retroviral replication. it catalyzes the integration of the newly synthesized viral DNA genome into the host genomic. aptamers to reverse transcriptase (RT) have two enzymatic activities. aptamers inhibited RT from diverse primate lentiviruses with low nM IC50 values. they inhibited the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT in vitro with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar range. the aptamer competed with the natural template for the binding site in the enzyme. authors suggested that stabilized RNA aptamer is expected to act as an inhibitor for the viral packaging. phosphorothioate 8-mer d(TTGGGGTT), named ISIS 5320, forms a tetrameric G-quadruplex structure that binds the V3 loop of gp120 inhibiting virus entry. the aptamer binds to the CCR5-binding site on gp120 in a relatively CD4-independent manner, providing a mechanistic explanation for its neutralizing potency [58,60]. Aptamers to Gag Protein Other typical therapeutic target is Gag polyprotein, because of its low variability. the viral enzyme integrase (IN) is essential for retroviral replication. the viral enzyme catalyzes the integration of the newly synthesized viral DNA genome into the host genomic. aptamers to integrase (IN) inhibited HIV replication in vitro. aptamers inhibited RT from diverse primate lentiviruses with low nM IC50 values. they inhibited the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT in vitro with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar range. authors suggested that stabilized RNA aptamer is expected to act as an inhibitor for the viral packaging. phosphorothioate 8-mer d(TTGGGGTT) forms a tetrameric G-quadruplex structure that binds the V3 loop of gp120 inhibiting virus entry. amer binds to the CCR5-binding site on gp120 in a relatively CD4-independent manner. amer binds to the CCR5-binding site on gp120 in a relatively CD4-independent manner, providing a mechanistic explanation for its neutralizing potency. Zhou et al. have reported the selection of RNA aptamers against CCR5 using high throughput sequencing (HTS) the individual sequences were classified into six major groups. group 2, 4 and 5 shared a conserved sequence, which is comprised of 10 nucleotides UUCGUCUG(U/G)G. aptamer AS1411 effectively inhibited HIV-1 attachment/entry into the host cell in the absence of cytotoxicity at the tested doses. human CCR5 is an important co-receptor for macrophage-tropic virus expressed by T-cells and macrophages. AS1411 is a G-rich aptamer that forms a stable G-quadruplex structure. it displays antineoplastic properties both in vitro and in vivo. the major molecular target of AS1411 is NCL. Zhou et al. isolated RNA aptamers against the HIV-1(BaL) gp120 protein. the authors also demonstrated that one of these anti-gp120 aptamer-siRNA chimera is specifically taken up by cells expressing HIV-1 gp120. both the aptamer and the siRNA portions in the aptamer-siRNA chimera have potent anti-HIV activities. a DNA aptamer obtained from the conversion of a previously reported RNA aptamer could be used to deliver siRNA into CD4+ T cells specifically. this DNA aptamer was covalently conjugated to the sense strand of the siRNA targeting HIV-1 protease (HIV-PR) and the resulting DNA aptamer-siRNA chimera effectively knockdown the expression of exogenous HIV-PR gene. aptamers 8\u20136, 8\u201310, 8\u201313 RNA Nucleocapsid viral protein [47] Hotoda\u2019s sequence and modifications DNA gp120 viral protein [48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] B4, B40, B40t77 RNA gp120 viral protein [55,56,57,58,59] ML6.8t33-82. the assay was built with an aptamer selected against the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) the described aptasensor was approximately 40-fold more sensitive than the conventional method. in 2015, a new set of three different DNA aptamers was selected against HBsAg and applied to develop a chemiluminescence platform. aptamer Apt.No.28 prevents nucleocapsid assembly and viral replication in the hepatic cellular line HepG2.2.15 [77] Orabi et al. have isolated DNA aptamers to recognize specifically the matrix binding domain (MBD) but not the domain mutated in the residue 126 (I126A) new aptasensor was designed with aptamers-conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles reaching a detection limit five-fold better than the current enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits used in hospitals. aptamers to HBV as antiviral agents have been described using aptamers selected against diverse viral target proteins. orabi et al. have isolated DNA aptamers to recognize specifically the matrix binding domain (MBD) but not the domain mutated in the residue 126 (I126A) AO-01 has been proposed as a therapy molecule by inhibition of the virion production interfering the interaction between the matrix domain and the MBD [78]. first, Lee et al. developed a biosensor prototype that specifically recognizes the HCV core protein from sera of an infected patient using selected RNA aptamers against core antigen. the aptamers were retained by the 2\u2032-F aptamers immobilized in a 96-well plate and detected by sequential steps with anti-core and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies. two labs have developed label-free aptasensor to eliminate labelling step. aptamers to HCV as antiviral agents Eradication of HCV disease is one of the main objectives of global public health. aptamers to 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions have highly conserved sequences and structured regions closely related with transcription and replication of the HCV virus. in 2003, toulm\u00e9 et al. decided to use subdomain IIId of IRES element as an antiviral target. in 2003, toulm\u00e9 et al. decided to use subdomain IIId of IRES element as an antiviral target. the fused aptamers recognized two different subdomains of IRES element. they are at least 10 times more efficient than the parental aptamers in the inhibition of mRNA IRES-dependent translation in vitro. chimeric aptamer-ribozymes were able to recognize the IRES element and cleavage the 5\u2032 end at nucleotide position 363. amers, P58 and P78, interact with subdomain 5BSL3.2 of the CRE element and produce a structural reorganization of the 3\u2032 end HCV genome. aptamer NS2-2 inhibited viral particle production as a result of N-terminal protein domain interaction, preventing NS5A/NS2 complex. aptamer NS2-2 is an essential protein for virus survival and is considered a good target for the development of new antiviral-drugs. Nishikawa et al. conjugated G9-II aptamer to the stem IV region of the Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme. to allow nuclear export of the aptamer, the chimeric molecule HDV-G9-II (HA) was fused to a constitutive transport element (CTE) generating HAC molecule. in order to inhibit the dual activity of NS3, a poly U tail in the 5 the designed molecule G925-s50 showed a significant inhibition of NS3 helicase-protease activity in vivo. it is proposed by Nishikawa group as the best candidate for anti-HCV therapy. recently, Yu et al. isolated and characterized DNA aptamers against HCV NS5A protein. 27v aptamer partially competes to dissociate RdRp-RNA complex formation. interference of viral production and transcription inhibition of HCV virus was confirmed in vivo. 5m, 5mS, 5mL1, 5mL2, ss5m-3\u2032X, 3\u2032(+) UTR, UC-3\u2032X, 3\u2032(+) RNA NS3 [108] NEO-35-sX, G925-sX RNA NS3 [109] NS5A-1,2,3,4 &5 DNA NS5A [110] A,1, A.2, B.1, B,2, B,3, C.1 & C aptamers are putative targets in therapy due to its role in HCV viral recognition to enter into hepatic cells. the selected aptamers have higher affinity to genotype 1a, 1b and 2a than others, and strongly prevented HCV viral infection in Huh7 5.1 cells. different groups have developed diverse aptasensors to improve diagnostic assay of HCV infection. first, Lee et al. developed a biosensor prototype that specifically recognizes HCV viral proteins using selected RNA aptamers against core antigen. HCV ELISA assay and core aptamer lateral flow strips showed positive coincidence rates when compared with HCV RNA amplification assay. park et al. have designed an ELISA-like assay replacing the capture and detection antibodies for DNA aptamers selected against HCV E2. different advances have been made based on aptamers against HCV and host cell proteins as therapy. cellular entry factors and lipid related factors have been identified as important targets for aptamer selection. proteins and factors implicated in viral release are crucial for viral propagation. aptamers fused to a hammerhead ribozyme were able to recognize the IRES element and cleavage the 5\u2032 end at nucleotide position 363 [93] Romero-L\u00f3pez et al. described an innovative in vitro selection method to isolate aptamers fused to a hammerhead ribozyme with capacity to inhibit RNA translation mediated by IRES. a RNA aptamer, named AP30, was able to recognize this minus-IRES region and reduce positive-strand genomic RNA synthesis [96,97]. a RNA aptamer, named AP30, was able to recognize this minus-IRES region and reduce positive-strand genomic RNA synthesis [96,97]. aptamers to HCV Proteins Aptamers to Nonstructural Protein 2 (NS2) NS2 protein is a remarkable H aptamers inhibited protease activity (10-G1) or the dual activity, protease/helicase, of the enzyme NS3 (G6-16 and G6-19). aptamers were able to inhibit protease activity in vitro. a poly U tail in the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of G9-I aptamer (5\u2032-14U-NEO-III) was added. aptamer #5 was designed using a truncated version of aptamer #5 plus G9-II aptamer linked by 50 mer poly(U spacer) it showed a significant inhibition of NS3 helicase-protease activity in vivo. recently, Yu et al. have isolated and characterized DNA aptamers against NS5A protein. the selected aptamers, B.2, blocked RNA transcription but not competed with the complex RdRp-RNA. one of the chosen aptamers, 27v, competed with positive and negative sense HCV viral RNA to bind RdRp polymerase. 127v aptamer partially competes to dissociate RdRp-RNA complex formation and only inhibited initiation steps of HCV transcription. aptamer 5, 5 (1-30), 5ss, 5D, 5m, 5mS, 5mL1, 5mL2, ss5m-3\u2032X, 3\u2032X RNA NS3 [108] NS5A-1,2,3,4 &5 DNA NS5A [110] A,1, A.2, B.1, B,2, B,3, C.1 & C.2 RNA NS5B [111] Class A, B, C & D ( aptamers were truncated and conjugated with cholesterol- or galactose-PEG molecules. aptamers were non-genotype-specific; however, Jones et al. described for the first time aptamers against NS5 protein that exclusively recognized and inhibited RNA-polymerase activity of HCV subtype 3a. Lee et al. have created a chimeric molecule composed by a hammerhead ribozyme conjugated with an aptamer against NS5B protein. after aptamer recognition of HCV infection, ribozyme domain released a sequence complementary to miR-122 producing the inhibition of HCV replication in Huh-7 cells. none has been tested in clinical trials because it is necessary to overcome a number of limitations such as degradation, biodistribution, aptamers fused to a hammerhead ribozyme with capacity to inhibit RNA translation mediated by IRES. the fused aptamers recognized two different subdomains of IRES element and are at least 10 times more efficient than the parental aptamers in the inhibition of mRNA IRES-mediated translation in vitro. aptamers to nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) NS2 protein is a remarkable HCV target for the development of direct-acting antivirals due to the fact that NS2 protein is implicated in HCV replication. aptamer NS2-2 inhibited viral particle production as a result of N-terminal protein domain interaction, preventing NS5A/NS2 complex. a new set of RNA aptamers were selected against the helicase domain of NS3 protein, named G9-I, II and III. the truncated NS3 form inhibited protease activity in vitro. a new set of aptamers were selected against the helicase domain of NS3. aptamer #5 was designed using a truncated version of aptamer #5 plus G9-II aptamer linked by 50 mer poly(U) spacer. designed molecule showed significant inhibition of NS3 helicase-protease activity in vivo. proposed by Nishikawa group as the best candidate for anti-HCV therapy. Bellecave et al. selected aptamers against the NS5B viral protein. one of the chosen aptamers, 27v, competed with positive and negative sense HCV viral RNA to bind RdRp polymerase. but 127v aptamer partially competes to dissociate RdRp-RNA complex formation and only inhibited initiation steps of RNA transcription. aptamer 5, 5 (1-30), 5ss, 5D, 5m, 5mS, 5mL1, 5mL2, ss5m-3\u2032X, 3\u2032(+) UTR, UC-3\u2032X, 3\u2032X RNA NS3 [108] NS5A-1,2,3,4 &5 DNA NS5A [110] A,1, A.2, B.1, B,2, B,3, C.1 & C.2 RNA NS5 aptamers were truncated and conjugated with cholesterol- or galactose-PEG molecules. the aptamers were non-genotype-specific; however, Jones et al. described for the first time aptamers against NS5 protein that exclusively recognized and inhibited RNA-polymerase activity of HCV subtype 3a. aptamer NS2-2 inhibited viral particle production as a result of N-terminal protein domain interaction, preventing NS5A/NS2 complex. aptamer NS2-2 inhibited viral particle production as a result of N-terminal protein domain interaction, preventing NS5A/NS2 complex. new RNA aptamers against the helicase domain of NS3 protein were able to inhibit protease activity in vitro. the authors described the interaction between G9-I aptamer and Arg161/Arg130 residues in the truncated NS3 form as a putative target for protease activity inhibition. aptamer #5 was selected against the helicase domain using the truncated NS3 protein (NS3h) and the aptamer with greatest capability to deplete helicase activity in vitro was identified and named aptamer #5. the designed molecule G925-s50 showed a significant inhibition of NS3 helicase-protease activity in vivo. Bellecave et al. selected aptamers against the NS5B viral protein. one of the chosen aptamers, 27v, competed with positive and negative sense HCV viral RNA to bind RdRp polymerase. but 127v aptamer partially competes to dissociate RdRp-RNA complex formation and only inhibits initiation steps of RNA transcription. aptamer 5, 5 (1-30), 5ss, 5D, 5m, 5mS, 5mL1, 5mL2, ss5m-3\u2032X, 3\u2032(+) UTR, UC-3\u2032X, 3\u2032X RNA NS3 [108] NS5A-1,2,3,4 &5 DNA NS5A [110] A,1, A.2, B.1, B,2, B,3, C.1 & C.2 RNA NS5 aptamers were truncated and conjugated with cholesterol- or galactose-PEG molecules. aptamers were non-genotype-specific; however, Jones et al. described for the first time aptamers against NS5 protein that exclusively recognized and inhibited RNA-polymerase activity of HCV virus subtype 3a. the selected aptamers have higher affinity to genotype 1a, 1b and 2a than others. aptamers against human papillomavirus (HPV) have been shown to be good tools for inhibiting viral protein activity. none has been tested in clinical trials because it is necessary to overcome a number of limitations such as degradation, biodistribution, immune response or cellular internalization. toscano-Garibay et al. isolated an aptamer (G53N.4) that exhibited specificity for E7 with a Kd comparable to aptamers directed to other small targets. the same group characterized an RNA aptamer, named Sc5-c3, that recognized baculovirus-produced HPV-16 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) with high specificity and affinity. this aptamer produced specific and stable binding to HP authors demonstrated that A2 enhanced E7 localization in the ER. aptamers internalized into HPV-16 E6/E7-human tonsillar epithelial cells. one of them internalized into E6/E7-HTECs with similar efficiency. the same group characterized an RNA aptamer, named Sc5-c3, that recognized baculovirus-produced HPV-16 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) with high specificity and affinity. this aptamer produced specific and stable binding to HPV-16 L1 VLPs even in biofluid protein mixes. this aptamer may provide a potential diagnostic tool for active HPV infection. RNA aptamers entered with significant internalization capacity (5-fold) into HPV-16 E6/E7-human tonsillar epithelial cells (HTECs) one of them exhibited three-fold better internalization into E6/E7-HTECs. authors claim aptamers that internalize into cells may be useful for delivering therapeutic agents to HPV-16 associated malignancies. aptamer-1 and aptamer-5) were isolated against the ectodomain of the gD protein of HSV-1. aptamer-1 effectively blocked the interaction between the gD protein and the HSV-1 target cell receptor (HVEM) in a dose-dependent manner with a EC50. 1918 Spanish influenza virus was estimated to have killed 20\u201350 million people worldwide. in 2009, a new influenza A virus of the H1N1 subtype emerged (pH1N1) that possessed high transmissibility but relatively low virulence. in 2009, a new influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype emerged (pH1N1) that possessed high transmissibility but relatively low virulence. the antibodies are the most common probe used to detect either the viral particles or host antibodies developed during the infection. however, only a few antibodies that differentiate subtypes of Influenza A or B have been reported. alternative probes for subtyping are the aptamers. pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry and fatal infections in human cases for over a decade. aptamers have been generated and found to be specific against these recent pandemic influenza viruses A/H1N1pdm [142] and H5N1 [143] Lee et al. developed an integrated microfluidic system that was used to screen a specific aptamer for the influenza A/H1N1 virus. the entire detection process was shortened to 30 min the alternative approach is biosensors technology. several biosensors have been developed to detect H5N1 AIV. the impedance-based aptasensor described by Fu et al. has the lowest detection limit. Nguyen et al. developed a sandwich-type SPR-based biosensor. the sensitivity of the dual aptamer-based system increased by more than 50-fold than for single-aptamers. aptamers against influenza virus have been developed for therapeutics purposes. aptamer-induced inhibition of viral infection was determined by prevention of weight loss, decrease of viral load in the lungs and restriction of inflammation and cellular infiltration. the administration of A22 one day prior to infection (preventive treatment) was less effective, probably because the DNA is partially degraded. eIF4GI and eIF4GI may be involved in preferential translation of viral mRNAs during influenza infection. NS1 is a nonstructural protein of small size, between amino acids 230 and 238. NS1 has anti-interferon properties leading to the inhibition of the host\u2019s innate immunity. this heterotrimer is composed of three subunits named PA, PB1 and PB2. PA plays the role of an endonuclease, cleaving host mRNAs downstream of their mRNA cap structures. the N-terminal of the PA subunit (PAN) is highly conserved among different subtypes of influenza virus. DNA virus [144,145,146] Influenza H5N1 n.d. DNA HA [148] Influenza H5Nx IF10, IF15, IF20, IF22, IF23 DNA Virus [153] Influenza H3N2 A21, A22 DNA HA-(91\u2013261) peptide [154] Influenza H5N1 A05, A10 DNA HA from H5N1 [155] Influenza H1N1 CP a limited number of aptamers targeting host cell factors have been described. the use of a specific RIG-I aptamer that activates RIG-I effectively blocks the replication of the Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus in infected cells. aptamer ApPABP11 inhibits the interactions between NS1 and eIF4GI or PABP1. aptamers targeting the host factors that interact with viral proteins may potentially have a broad therapeutic spectrum. detection rapid of influenza virus as well as the categorization of these viruses is particularly important due to the high risk of infection. these RNA aptamers are able to discriminate among both A and B influenza viruses. these aptamers have been generated and found to be specific against these recent pandemic influenza viruses A/H1N1pdm [142] and H5N1 [143]. the entire detection process was shortened to 30 min using this chip-based system. a single fluorescent-labelled aptamer is able to identify three different influenza viruses (influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) at the same time, by modifying operating conditions, in 20 min. this chip-based aptamer-binding assay has several important advantages. current methods for H5N1 AIV detection are virus isolation and RT-PCR that requires several days. fluidics chips has a lower detection limit than the SPR-based aptasensor [148] and the same sensitivity as the QCM-based aptasensor [149] but the aptasensors are not practical for in-field use due to the QCM\u2019s predisposition to environmental noise. the major advantage of the impedance aptasensor with gold nanoparticles for signal amplification described by Karash et al. is that it requires a small sample volume aptamers can mediate a reduction in viral pathogenicity in mice. only a few studies have described aptamers capable of mediating a reduction in viral pathogenicity in mice. viral particles present high amounts of hemagglutinin (HA) required for binding and fusion with the host cell. enveloped negative-strand viral RNA produces a full length (+) which in turn is copied to a full-length () strand RNA then used to assembled new virions. the importance of NS1 in viral infection makes it an attractive therapeutic target. aptamer induced IFN- production by inhibiting NS1 function. another antiviral strategy is the inhibition of enzymes involved in the viral replication, transcription and translation. amers described against influenza virus discussed herein. aptamers selected against influenza virus discussed herein. a limited number of aptamers targeting host cell factors have been described. the use of a specific RIG-I aptamer that activates RIG-I effectively blocks the replication of the Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. both aptamers inhibit influenza virus replication of H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes at high and low multiplicity of infection. aptamer ApPABP11 inhibits the interactions between NS1 and eIF4GI or PABP1. aptamers targeting the host factors that interact with viral proteins may potentially have a broad therapeutic spectrum. the emergence of RVFV in the Middle East, northern Egypt and the Comoros Archipelago has highlighted that the geographical range of RVFV may be increasing. the nucleocapsid protein (N) of RVFV is an RNA binding protein required for the production of viable virus because of its involvement in several stages of viral replication. this protein protects the viral genome from degradation and prevents the formation of double stranded RNA intermediates during replication. tamers to Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV) Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. this virus produces tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), an emerging infectious disease that targets the central nervous system (CNS) aptamer can neutralize the infections by all four serotypes of DENVs. the deNV capsid (C) protein functions as a structural component of the infectious virion. this interaction can be disrupted by the addition of a NCL binding aptamer (AS1411). four of five known viruses in this genus cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) four of five known viruses in this genus cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals. aptamer technology identifies RNA sequences that could be a target of ZAP. overexpression of the aptamers significantly reduced ZAP\u2019s antiviral activity. overexpression of the aptamers significantly reduced ZAP\u2019s antiviral activity. two studies have selected DNA and RNA aptamers against the non-structural nsp13 protein. this protein inhibited helicase activity with subnanomolar IC50. the ATPase activity was not affected, suggesting the aptamers may bind to the nucleic acid binding site of the helicase. emergence of RVFV in the Middle East, northern Egypt and the Comoros Archipelago has highlighted that the geographical range of RVFV may be increasing. the nucleocapsid protein (N) of RVFV is an RNA binding protein required for the production of viable virus because of its involvement in several stages of viral replication. aptamers were labeled with fluorescein using a fluorescence polarization (FP) system. aptamers could be used to construct a sensitive fluorescence based sensor of N binding. TBEV belongs to the family Flaviviridae genus Flavivirus. aptamer (S15) can bind to DENV-2 envelop protein domain III (ED3) with a high binding affinity. the aptamer can neutralize the infections by all four serotypes of DENVs. the deNV capsid protein functions as a structural component of the infectious virion. aptamer S1 was inserted into the 3\u2032 end of dengue virus (DENV) 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 UTR RNA. the deNV RNA UTR fused to the S1 RNA aptamer was expressed in living mammalian cells. this allowed endogenous viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly and isolation of RNPs from whole cell extract. this strategy led to identify several novel host DENV RBPs. select aptamers can inhibit the function of the EBOV polymerase complex reconstituted by expression of select viral proteins. the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host factor that specifically inhibits the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), Sindbis virus (SIN) and Ebola virus. RNA encodes two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and four structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. both DNA and RNA aptamers against N protein have been developed with Kd of 4.93 and 1.65 nM, respectively. the number of aptamers used in clinical practice is limited, probably due to the ignorance that still exists towards this technology. aptamers can recognize and/or inhibit target activity through specific and strong interactions superior to other biologics. aptamers selected as specific anti-viral molecules are effective in infected cells. the success of treatment in viral diseases depends on early detection of the infective agent. the most probable use of aptamers in virus diagnostics involves the development of more simple, fast and cheap diagnostics devices. novel target proteins should be chosen in HIV reservoir organs for isolation of aptamers. aptamers could be applied to drug delivery or targeting of nanoparticles loaded with drugs to obtain HIV transcriptional activation. nanoparticles have been considered for a wide range of applications, both in soluble and insoluble forms. nanoparticles' application to delivery of antiviral drugs improves bioavailability. use of aptamers is promising alternative for the treatment of viral diseases."}
