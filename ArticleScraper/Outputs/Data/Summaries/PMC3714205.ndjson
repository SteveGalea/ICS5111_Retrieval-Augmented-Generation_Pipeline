{"summary": "cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are secreted by cells in response to normal developmental cues or environmental stimuli to relay information to specific target cells expressing the appropriate receptor on their surface. a range of intracellular signaling cascades lead to appropriate cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and functional activation. all SOCS proteins consist of three conserved domains, the N-terminal, SH2 and SOCS box domains. the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) in SOCS1 and SOCS3 and the N-terminal conserved region (NTCR) in SOCS4 and SOCS5 is the least conserved and has a variety of roles. the SH2 domains of the SOCS proteins interact in a context-specific manner with phosphotyrosine residues present on their target proteins. these are longer than typical SH2 domains due to a so-called extended SH2 sequence (ESS) also found in STAT1 and STAT3, which contributes to their function [12] proteins are able to regulate receptor signaling through recruitment of proteasomal degradation components to their target proteins. this is achieved by binding to these targets through their SH2 domains and recruitment of Elongin B/C heterodimers, Cullin5 and other components of a E3 ubiquitination complex via their SOCS box [18,20]. SOCS members can also regulate signaling via alternate methods. receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) act as transcription factors to induce expression of target genes. targets include SOCS genes capable of regulating receptor signaling, creating a negative feedback loop. RTKs possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and may by-pass STAT activation. SOCS proteins are able to regulate signaling downstream of a range of receptors. current evidence indicates that CISH and SOCS1-3 are most often associated with regulation of cytokine receptor signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. however, SOCS4-7 predominantly regulate growth factor receptor signaling. the SH2 domain is longened by the addition of an extended SH2 sequence (ESS) the SOCS box consists of BC box and Cul box sub-domains that recruit Elongin B and C, Cullin5, RBX1 and other E3 ligase components to mediate ubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent proteasomal degradation. the SOCS box is comprised of two functional sub-domains. a BC box that recruits Elongin B and C, and a Cul box that mediates Cullin5 binding. the resulting complex is able to bind RBX2 leading in turn to recruitment of the remaining components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. SOCS1 and SOCS3 bind Cullin5 at a much lower affinity than other SOCS proteins. they are able to directly inhibit JAK kinases, binding via their KIR domain to the JAK activation loop to inhibit kinase activity. CISH, SOCS2 and SOCS3 can also inhibit signaling via their ability to bind to phosphotyrosine residues. the role of SOCS proteins has been investigated by a range of approaches. the function of individual SOCS proteins has been investigated by a range of approaches. KO and transgenic (Tg) models reveal important roles in development.

Association of SOCS proteins with disease SOCS protein Disease association Mechanism Reference CISH Infectious disease susceptibility SNP at position -29 (blunted induction by IL-2) [56] Osteoarthritis Decreased expression [60] SOCS1 CISH CISH was identified as an immediate-early gene induced in hematopoietic cells in response to stimulation by a variety of cytokines. erythropoietin (EPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). in mice, strong expression of Cish was observed in the kidney, lung and liver [30,36], with lower expression in heart, stomach, testis, spleen, and thymus [30,36], underpinning the key role of STAT5 in CISH gene regulation. CISH is also induced by IL-6 [36], IL-10 [42], interferon [43], IFN [36], tumor necrosis factor [36], thymic stromal lymphop CISH binds via its SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of activated cytokine receptors. binds to the same receptor phosphotyrosine sites as STAT5, thereby blocking further STAT5 docking. a recent study has indicated a role for CISH during GM-CSF. mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were induced by GM-CSF treatment. CISH knockdown caused a decline in MHC class I, pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecule expression. this was associated with enhanced STAT5 activation. cish.a is a direct downstream target of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in vivo. levels of CISH mRNA were also found to be higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patients in acute phase compared to either normal individuals or patients with inactive phase of disease. this suggests CISH plays a clinically-relevant role that might provide new strategies for controlling infectious agents and inflammatory diseases. transfection with miR-155 inhibited wild-type SOCS1 [74] in mouse osteoblastic cells. SOCS1 has also been found to regulate signaling by a raft of receptors in vitro. it can also interact with Elongin B/C and Cullin5 via its SOCS box. socs1 KO mice developed a fatal neonatal disease that resulted in death by three weeks of age. these animals showed severe lymphopenia and T cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory disease. phenotypes were significantly reduced in Ifn/Socs1 double KO mice and in Socs1 KO mice treated with anti-IFN antibodies. mice lacking Socs1 expression in all but their T and B cells developed spontaneous dermatitis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. they showed an accumulation of DCs in their thymi and spleens, which were hyper-responsive to both IFN and IL-4. this resulted in the development of systemic autoimmune-like diseases with hypergammaglobulinemia at an early age [52] zebrafish SOCS1 was shown to interact with the zebrafish JAK2/STAT5 pathway in vitro and in vivo. this demonstrated SOCS1 exerts a T cell-independent function in embryonic myelopoiesis likely mediated via regulation of receptors that utilise the JAK2-STAT5 pathway. the SOCS1 gene has been found to be frequently mutated in both classical Hodgkin lymphoma [113,114] and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma [115], leading to augmented signaling by STAT5 [113,115] and STAT6 [114] chronic myeloid leukemia patients also demonstrated hypermethylation of SOCS1 that reverted to an unmethylated state during remission. hypermethylation of the SOCS gene has also been observed in breast and ovarian cancer. SOCS1 has also been shown to suppress oncogenic forms of VAV [87], c-MET [130], ABL and c-KIT [131] and TEL-JAK2 and BCR-ABL fusions. SOCS2 is most closely related to CISH, and like CISH is induced by cytokines that activate STAT5, including GH [32,143], EPO [36,144], PRL [34] IL-2 [145], IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF [36], but also by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) [149] and insulin-like growth factor (INS) [72]. SOCS2 exerts its effects by stimulating ubiquitination of target proteins, including receptors, such as GHR [151], and signaling proteins, such as SOCS3 [148]. a naturally-occurring mouse mutant, high growth (hg) has been mapped to the Socs2 region, indicating that hg is most likely an allele of Socs2 \u2013 although whether it is hypomorphic or hypermorphic remains to be determined. transgenic mice overexpressing SOCS2 specifically in pancreatic -cells showed unaltered insulin and glucose tolerance when compared to WT mice. adenovirus-mediated expression of the SOCS2 gene in pancreatic islets significantly suppressed glucose stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a requirement for SOCS2 in TLR-induced DC activation. cytokines IL-1 [164], IL-2 [165], IL-3 [166], IL-4 [63], IL-6 [167], IL-9 [35], IL-13 [36], IL-22 [169], IFN-[67], EPO [170], also implicated in oncogenesis. cytokines IL-1 [164], IL-2 [165], IL-3 [166], IL-3 [63], IL-4 [63], IL-6 [35], SOCS3 has been shown to play a regulatory role in signaling downstream of a wide range of cytokine receptors. it is also induced by several growth factors, including EGF [176,177], platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [176], thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin [72], and basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) [178]. SOCS3 can also regulate signaling by targeting proteins for degradation. but this is not its primary mechanism of action, as it can still regulate signaling without its SOCS box [21]. it has been demonstrated that an IL-6 transcriptional response can be converted to one mimicking that of interferons when SOCS3 is absent. differentiation of SOCS3-deficient progenitors was skewed toward a macrophage state in response to G-CSF and IL-6 stimulation. SOCS3 was also shown to be a positive regulator of TLR4 responses in macrophages via inhibition of IL-6R-mediated STAT3 activation [194] and endogenous TGF-mediated/SMAD3 [195]. hematopoietic and endothelial cell-specific Socs3 KO mice exhibited impaired lactation resulting from reduced proliferation. SOCS3 has also been shown to play a role in fine-tuning photoreceptor cell differentiation. SOCS3 has been found to be upregulated in the peripheral T cells from patients with Th2 type diseases, such as atopic asthma and dermatitis. overcoming SOCS3 regulation seems to be a common theme in proliferative syndromes. SOCS3 was protective against hepatitis-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. loss of SOCS3 leading to resistance to apoptosis and increased proliferation. similar epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 has been seen in cholangiocarcinoma cells. brafish socs4a homologue expressed in the embryonic nervous system. it is widely expressed, with higher expression in the olfactory bulb. miR-98 and let-7 are thought to post-transcriptionally regulate SOCS4. SOCS4 expression was significantly lower in cancerous tissue compared to non-cancerous tissue in a patient with gastric cancer. mouse studies also suggest a tumor suppressor in epithelial cells via RUNX1-mediated repression of the SOCS4 promoter. expression was particularly high in lymphoid organs including the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow. the SOCS5 protein has been found to associate with EGFR independent of ligand stimulation, binding via its N-terminal domain [225]. Interestingly, the SOCS5 protein has been found to associate with EGFR independent of ligand stimulation, binding via its N-terminal domain, binding via its N-terminal domain. eosinophil production is stimulated by IL-4-mediated eosinophil infiltration. in mice constitutively expressing SOCS5 under control of the lck proximal promoter and E enhancer, decreased conjunctival eosinophil infiltration was observed. this suggests a regulatory role for SOCS5 on the IL-4/STAT6 pathway. SOCS6 interacts with an alternate E3 ligase component, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1), which induces the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of SOCS6-associated proteins. the SOCS6 N-terminal domain has been shown to drive localisation to the nucleus, where it appears to negatively regulate STAT3. rite outgrowth was also enhanced by IGF-1, which increased SOCS6 levels, but reduced in the presence of a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor. a large body of in vitro data supporting a role for SOCS6 in glucose homeostasis has been shown to inhibit pathways downstream of the INS and IGF-1 receptors. despite its expression in the bone marrow, no hematological phenotypes could be identified in these mice. redundancy between SOCS family members may play a role in the absence of a phenotype in these mice. expression in the 129S6 strain was highest in isolated pancreatic islets. lower levels detected in the liver, perigonadal fat, skin, whole pancreas, testis and spleen. expression in the 129S6 strain was similar overall, but with a 5-fold decrease in whole brain expression, a 6-fold increase in spleen expression. one Socs7 KO mouse line exhibited a 7-10% reduction in body size compared to wild type littermates. the hydrocephalus was obviated, which revealed increased insulin sensitivity. this was consistent with the findings that SOCS7 can interact with the INS receptor and their adaptor proteins. erythropoietin (EPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in mice, strong expression of Cish was observed in the kidney, lung and liver [30,36], with lower expression in heart, stomach, testis, spleen, and thymus [30,36]. recent studies suggest that CISH is regulated post-transcriptionally by microRNAs (miRs), with miR-98 or let-7 shown to target the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of the CISH mRNA, causing translational repression. the mRNA contains ATAA destabilisation motifs, while the CISH protein possesses PEST sequences, which lead to rapid turnover of the mRNA and protein. transgenic mice expressing CISH under control of the -actin promoter exhibited growth retardation caused by reduced GHR signaling, defective mammary gland development due to disrupted PRL receptor signaling. altered T and Natural killer (NK) responses as a result of blunted IL-2R signaling in T cells. no Cish KO mouse has been described, suggesting a specific in vivo role in the regulation of STAT5. an association has been found between CISH single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to infectious diseases, including bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis. a SNP at position -292 of the CISH promoter was the most highly associated, increasing the overall risk of infectious disease by at least 18% among persons carrying the variant allele. SOCS1 has been shown to be induced by numerous cytokines in vitro and ex vivo, including IL-2 [62], IL-4 [22,63], IL-6 [22], IL-13 [64], IFN/ [65,66], IFN- [36,67], EPO [23,36], G-CSF [22], LIF [22], PRL [34], GH [32], CNTF [46], CNTF [46] and TNF [ SOCS1 is known to regulate signaling via two mechanisms. first, it can bind directly to cytokine receptor-associated JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 to inhibit their tyrosine kinase activity via its ESS/KIR domains. SOCS1 can also interact with Elongin B/C and Cullin5 via its SOCS box. phenotypes, including polycystic kidneys, chronic infections, and inflammatory lesions, resulted in survival to only 6 months of age. reduced T cells numbers [94], disrupted Th2 responses [95], a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio [94], as well as abnormal development of Th17 cells [96], resulting from hypersensitivity to cytokines acting via the c receptor. these mice also showed a 10-fold increase in FOXP3(+) CD some studies have suggested that SOCS1 favors Th1 differentiation. others suggest that IL-6 induced SOCS1 blocks Th1 development via the inhibition of IFNR, leading to accelerated Th2 differentiation [100] SOCS1 expression has been shown to correlate inversely with severity of disease in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. adenovirally-delivered SOCS1 decreases fibrosis, inflammation and mortality in a murine model of pulmonary inflammation. adenovirally-delivered SOCS1 promoter SNP that increases SOCS1 expression was associated with adult-onset asthma [110] SOCS1 expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [121] also correlated with a poor response to interferon, treatment, likely due to a direct effect on receptor signaling. hypermethylation of SOCS1 has been commonly reported in solid tumors, including 61% of cervical cancer samples [123] and 45% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples [124]. toxoplasma gondii induces SOCS1 expression leading to inhibition of cytokine signaling and suppression of immune responses. hepatitis C core protein down-regulates SOCS1 resulting in enhanced STAT5 signaling in B cells. kines GH [26], PRL [147], LIF [145], IL-2, IL-3 [148] and IL-6 [21], but also by growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) [149] and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 [139]. SOCS2 appears to play a dualistic regulatory role. socs2 KO mice exhibited prolonged STAT5B activation in response to GH. crossing with Stat5b KO mice partially relieved the growth enhancement. SOCS2 exerts a dualistic role in the regulation of EGF signaling. adenovirus-mediated expression of the SOCS2 gene in pancreatic islets significantly suppressed glucose stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a likely mechanism by which SOCS2 may influence susceptibility to T2D. adenovirus-mediated expression of the SOCS2 gene in pancreatic islets significantly suppressed glucose stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting a mechanism by which SOCS2 may influence susceptibility to T2D. in mice, SOCS3 was found to be expressed in the spleen, thymus, and lung [36], while in humans, SOCS3 was expressed in the colon, spleen, bladder, peripheral blood leukocytes, trachea and placenta [61]. SOCS3 has been demonstrated to be induced by the cytokines IL-1 [164], IL-2 [165], IL-3 [166], IL-4 [63], IL-6 [167], SOCS3 can directly inhibit receptor-bound JAKs. it achieves this via a high-affinity interaction between its SH2 domain and a phosphotyrosine residue on the receptor. SOCS3 also regulates signaling via binding site competition. double KO mice died by 190 days of age due to neutrophilia. hematopoietic-specific Socs3 KO mice developed inflammatory conditions. this suggests SOCS3 is an important in vivo regulator of G-CSFR signaling. mice expressing a dominant-negative SOCS3 showed reduced Th2 development. those expressing a dominant-negative SOCS3 showed enhanced Th2 polarity. it has been suggested that the ability of SOCS3 to skew T cell differentiation may be due to an ability to compete for the STAT4-binding site. hematopoietic and endothelial cell-specific mice exhibited severe phenotypes in experimental arthritis models. adenoviral delivered SOCS3 could eliminate joint inflammation in mice with experimental autoimmune arthritis, mediate via inhibition of IL-6 signaling. SOCS3-mediated control of STAT5 activation is complex. hypermethylation of SOCS3 occurs frequently in both Barrett\u2019s adenocarcinoma [125] and hepatocellular carcinoma [211], in the latter case leading to increased JAK2/STAT3 activation [209]. hypermethylation mediated reduction in SOCS3 expression has also been observed in malignant human melanoma [212] severe inflammation mediated by SARS virus infection was found to correlate with lower expression of SOCS3 in infected cells. pathogenic strains of Salmonella sp. could increase SOCS3 expression in macrophages to mediate suppression of immune responses. a recent report has suggested a role for SOCS4 in regulation of primordial follicle activation. this occurred concurrently with SOCS4 induction, with SOCS4 shown to interact with several proteins involved in ovarian follicular development. id organs including the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow have specific expression in primary B and T cells. SOCS5 appears able to regulate both RTK and cytokine receptor signaling. this seems to be a conserved function since overexpression of the SOCS5 homologue, SOCS36E. cs5 KO mice showed no abnormalities in Th1/Th2 differentiation. atopic dermatitis [234], asthma [235] and uveitis [236] also showed redundancy in its lymphoid role. studies also provide further support for role for SOCS5 in regulating balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. SOCS5 transgenic mice also showed increased peritoneal IL-2 and IFN-, cytokines involved in the promotion of Th1 differentiation. a reduction in SOCS5 expression was observed in cancer of the thyroid gland [239] suggesting a possible tumor-suppressor function. SOCS6 binds to the juxtamembrane region of c-KIT. it also negatively regulates signaling of several important hematopoietic receptor kinases. a potential role for SOCS6 in neural stem cell differentiation has also been suggested. KO mice showed greatly reduced levels SOCS6 expression in their pancreatic islets. overexpression of SOCS6 inhibited glucose-induced ERK1/2 activation. this suggests a role for SOCS6 and PIM3 in the negative regulation of ERK1/2 in response to glucose stimulation. low SOCS6 expression has been associated with recurrent primary lung squamous cell carcinoma [248] and cancers of the liver and thyroid gland [239]. Loss of SOCS6 was also observed in over 50% of patients with gastric or colorectal cancer. this did not correlate with disease-free survival or overall survival. SOCS7 was able to inhibit PRL and leptin mediated activation of STAT5 and STAT3 respectively [29], achieved by direct interaction of SOCS7 with phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5. in these instances, SOCS7 likely regulates signaling activity through recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and subsequent proteasomal targeting of associated proteins [8]. 50% of hydrocephaly-resistant Socs7 KO mice developed a severe cutaneous disease by 16 months of age. the dermis appeared hyperplastic with an infiltration of leukocytes. this resulted in increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-13, IL-6 and TNF, with levels of TSLP and a component of its receptor upregulated."}
