{"summary": "amoeba histolytica is the protozoan parasite that causes amoebiasis in humans. it is widely prevalent in population of developing countries with poor living conditions. the real number of cases is unknown due to the inclusion in this estimation of cases with the morphologically identical E. dispar and E. moshkovskii species. the gal-lectin is considered one of the most immunogenic molecules. it is the target for serum of 95% of patients with amoebic liver abscess [9] as well as IgG and IgA anti-Gal-lectin antibodies recovered from serum and feces of patients with intestinal amoebiasis. baculoviruses are insect viruses capable of infecting mammalian cells. the most promising is Autographa californica, an envelope and double-stranded DNA nucleopolyhedrovirus. this virus can transduce a wide range of mammalian cells without causing cytotoxic effects. baculovirus displaying target antigens on surface and/or driving expression of them under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter has been highly efficient in inducing immune responses that confer protection against viral and parasitic infections in experimental models [24\u201335]. podoptera frugiperda (invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were cultivated as a suspension in Grace's medium (invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL), and 0.1% pluronic F-68 (invitrogen, USA) hamsters were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg; Anestesal, Pfizer), a laparatomy practiced in aseptic conditions. 106 trophozoites in 100 L PBS were directly injected in the portal vein. intestine carefully returned to the abdominal cavity. liver extracts were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. each well was added with 5 g of extract in 100 L of diluent solution. the soluble fraction, once determining protein concentration, was stored at 20\u00b0C until use. all the treatments were carried out by triplicate for each animal. samples were analyzed on a BD on a minimum of 20,000 events using the DIVA software. fetal bovine serum (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (invitrogen, CA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL) and 0.1% pluronic F-68 (invitrogen, USA). recombinant AcNPV-LC3 baculovirus was amplified by infecting sf9 insect cells at a multiplicity of infection ( 106 trophozoites in 100 L PBS were directly injected in the portal vein. the site of injection was immediately obtruded by applying a gel foam pad. intestine carefully returned to the abdominal cavity and the abdominal layers sutured with surgical staples. extracts were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. each well was added with 5 g of extract in 100 L of diluent solution. each well was added with 5 g of extract in 100 L of diluent solution. samples were analyzed on a BD on a minimum of 20,000 events using the DIVA software. the computational analysis was carried out in FACSDiva software version 6. development of ALA extended throughout the liver was observed in 8 out of 10 (80%) nonimmunized but challenged hamsters. 11 out of 20 hamsters immunized with the recombinant baculovirus AcNPV-LC3 and 5 out of 20 immunized with the wild-type baculovirus showed no gross (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) or microscopic evidence (not shown) of ALA development. intramus ALT levels in hamsters immunized with AcNPV-LC3 and challenged with E. histolytica were mainly observed in hamsters nonimmunized but infected. the results showed high levels of ALT, about three times above the reference value, in the serum of nonimmunized and infected animals. ant baculovirus and 30% of hamsters immunized with wild baculovirus showed any evidence of protection against the development of ALA. infection rate in hamsters intramuscularly immunized with AcNPV-LC3 and intraportally infected with virulent E. histolytica trophozoites. IgG antibodies in sera against total extract of E. histolytica trophozoites were measured by ELISA at day 0 and day 35. bars represent mean optical densities ( P 0.001). response was evaluated in splenocytes after immunization and challenge (day 49) response was evaluated by staining of harvested cells with CFSE and stimulation with E. histolytica total extract. cell population selected according to their size and granularity (P1 region) and its corresponding dot plot and histogram are shown (a) IL-4 was on average 8-fold higher in the livers of animals fully protected compared with immunized and infected animals. IL-4 was on average 8-fold higher in the livers of animals fully protected than the infected animals. recombinant baculoviruses were obtained and evaluated for driving the expression of the amoebic Gal-lectin LC3 fragment of protecting against ALA. hamsters were intramuscularly immunized with the viral particles and intraportally challenged with virulent E. histolytica trophozoites. a comparative macroscopic description of livers showed variable grades of ALA development. hamsters were IM immunized with baculovirus or PBS and then challenged with virulent E. histolytica trophozoites by intraportal route. livers were exscinded showing different grades of ALA. ALT levels are often low in blood but increased in case of liver diseases. the reference value, in the serum of nonimmunized and infected animals, correlates with an increase of more than twice the weight of the liver as a result of abscesses. 75% of hamsters immunized with the recombinant baculovirus (P 0.002 versus WT group by Fisher's test) and 30% of hamsters immunized with the wild baculovirus (P 0.02 versus AcNPV-LC oeba antigen showed high levels of specific IgG antibodies after intramuscular immunization with the recombinant baculovirus AcNPV-LC3. antibodies from hyperimmune sera of immunized hamsters were assumed to be directed against the LC3 fragment Gal-lectin. proliferation in the AcNPV-LC3 immunized but not protected hamsters was twice of the animals from control groups, but not statistically different. animals not protected and even those totally or partially protected by immunization with the wild baculovirus did not show any degree of splenocyte's proliferation against whole amoeba antigen. 3 and completely protected had on average 9-fold more IFN than infected animals. there was no statistical difference between the levels from liver of the partially protected and the nonprotected animals. this trend was observed in AcNPV-WT group, where totally protected animals have 6 times average of IFN more than infected animals. the partially protected hamsters showed a tendency to have higher concentrations of IL-4 than the infected animals. the difference was not statistically significant. the difference was not statistically significant. oral route triggers local and systemic immune responses. this is notable as extraintestinal amoebiasis, and in particular, ALA is considered the main cause of human death by E. histolytica. a new model of intestinal infection with E. histolytica in baboons was reported. s using LC3 as immunogen [15] strongly support that Gal-lectin is the target of protective antibodies and cellular immune responses resolving intra- and extraintestinal amoebiasis. the immune elements responsible for protection against ALA are not entirely known. in this regard, the wild-type baculovirus confers up to 25% protection by itself. baculovirus recognition by TL9 leads to the production of various cytokines that trigger innate immunity, including IFN [23], which in turn has the potential to confer high levels of protection in several experimental models. a previous study by our group using lactoferrin as an oral therapy for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis in C3H/HeJ mice showed production of IL-4 in tissue of ceca from animal cured [46] antibodies are important in protection against amoeba, particularly secretory IgA against intestinal amebiasis, and serum IgG and IgA against hepatic amoebiasis. the high levels of IFN observed in protected hamsters have also contributed to the increased production of IgG antibodies mentioned. the results suggest that both responses, cellular and humoral anti-LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin, are important for the development of resistance in hamsters use of such viruses as delivery system lays the foundation for safe and extended use of recombinant baculovirus systems in other areas such as vaccines. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
