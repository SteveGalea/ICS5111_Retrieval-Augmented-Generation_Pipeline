{"summary": "tumours contain effector cells, such as regulatory T cells and suppressive cell populations. tumours contain cytokines such as interferon (IFN) and interleukin10 (IL10) and transforming growth factor, which can oppose one another in regulating an immune response. systemic IL2 treatment has led to remarkable and durable remissions in a fraction of patients with melanoma. IL2 is a potent growth factor for T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. IL2 secretes much lower levels of IL2 when compared with the second clone, B16/IL2.4 (9000 pg/ml/48 hr), when assayed as described below. supernatants were harvested after 48 hr. intratumoral levels of IFN were examined by homogenizing tumour pieces in 500 l lysis buffer as described. samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0 for 8 min and supernatant was tested for total protein. NK cells in nude mice were depleted by intraperitoneal antibody injection twice a week of 100 g/mouse and 300 g/mouse once weekly of rat antimouse NK1.1 (clone PK136) cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained using antiIFN (Clone XMG1.2; BD Pharmingen), antifoxp3 (clone PC61; BD Pharmingen) all samples were analysed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo Software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR) samples were processed into homogenates and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy fibrous tissue mini kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. all mice were treated in accordance with guidelines approved by the University Committee on animal resources. the B16F0 (B16) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA; CRL 6322) whole mount analysis Mice were injected with either 2 105 or 1 106 (indicated in figure legend) tumour cells intramuscularly into the left thigh. mean thigh diameter was measured as previously described. tumour pieces were removed and stained using fluorescently conjugated antibodies. Flow cytometry Tumour samples were dissociated and single cell suspensions were stained as previously described. cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained using antiIFN. iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit was used for quantitative RTPCR analysis. cycle thresholds were normalized to GAPDH RNA within each sample. each value was expressed as fold increase over a single control sample. tumours formed from the B16/IL2.19 cells expressing IL2 were significantly smaller than tumours from parental B16 cells. this was not a result of different intrinsic growth rates, as their in vitro growth rate was very similar. IL2expressing tumours tended to contain more CD4 T cells. expression of CD25 was lower on Treg cells in the B16 tumour (light coloured line) compared with the same population of cells in the B16/IL2.19 tumour. open circles indicate B16/IL2.19 and each symbol represents the results from an individual tumour. the IL2expressing tumours grown in vivo expressed higher levels of IL2 message compared with B16 tumours. both Tbet and Eomesodermin were elevated in the B16/IL2.19 tumours. IL12p35, IL5 and IL17 were not substantially increased in B16/IL2.19 tumours. however, neither T helper type 17 nor classic T helper type 2 responses were induced. increased Foxp3 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen4 mRNA were increased 5fold and 11fold respectively. data are expressed as fold increases relative to the mRNA levels in one selected sample within the B16 tumour group. closed circles indicate B16 tumour homogenates, open circles represent B16/IL2.19 tumour homogenates. bars indicate the average of three tumours. local expression of interleukin2 (IL2) results in induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on vessel endothelial cells. increased infiltration of CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in an IFNdependent manner. a higher local level of IL2 might have more dramatic effects on tumour growth and the host immune response. the parental B16 and the B16/IL2.4 cell lines grew similarly in vitro. in Figure 5, we compared the growth of B16/IL2.4 with parental B16 controls in vivo. in mice, the B16/IL2.4 tumour growth was delayed, although tumours eventually grew out sporadically. these data suggest that T cells play an important role in controlling tumour progression in wildtype mice. mice were treated with antiTM1 to deplete natural killer (NK) cells. lines indicate the growth of tumours in individual mice. the end indicates that the mice were killed or had died during the course of the experiment. mice with no palpable or clearly measurable tumour were still clearly present by gross examination at day 14. at this timepoint, mice inoculated with the same number of parental B16 tumour cells would often need to be killed because of progressive tumour growth. the B16/IL2.4 tumours were also analysed by whole mount histology on day 28. mice were injected with 1 106 B16 or B16/IL2.4 cells. the tumours were processed into single cell suspensions. the frequency of T cells or NK cells was determined and normalized to the weight of the tumour to correct for differences in tumour size. at day 21 these mice were challenged with parental B16 tumours in the opposite leg. the original dormant tumours as well as tumours arising from the challenge were measured over time. naive mice challenged with B16 cells rapidly grew tumours. tumours depicted in a, were inoculated with 2 105 parental B16 cells in the opposite leg at day 21. naive animals were also challenged with the same dose of parental B16 cells. tumours from parental B16 cells showed increased infiltration of CD45positive immune cells compared with parental B16 tumours. a second independent experiment showed the same pattern of tumour growth. the presence of IL2 significantly increased the density of effector CD8 T cells and NK cells. IL2expressing tumours tended to contain more CD4 T cells. expression of CD25 was lower on Treg cells in the B16 tumour (light coloured line) compared with the same population in the B16/IL2.19 tumour (darker line) the IL2expressing B16/IL2.19 tumours grown in vivo expressed higher levels of IL2 message compared with B16/IL2.19 tumours. both Tbet, a critical transcription factor for cell mediated responses, and Eomesodermin, a Tbox transcription factor important for CD8 Tcell function, were elevated in the B16/IL2.19 tumours. IL12p35, IL5 and IL17 were not substantially increased in B16/IL2.19 tumours. however, neither T helper type 17 nor classic T helper type 2 responses were induced. cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen4 mRNA transcripts most often associated with counterregulation of immune responses were increased 5fold and 11fold respectively. data are expressed as fold increases relative to the mRNA levels in one selected sample within the B16 tumour group. closed circles indicate B16/IL2.19 tumour homogenates. bars indicate the average of three tumours. local expression of interleukin2 (IL2) results in induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on vessel endothelial cells and increased infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells in an IFNdependent manner. levels of IFN is expressed per mg of total protein in tumour homogenates. the parental B16 and the B16/IL2.4 cell lines grew similarly in vitro. in Figure 5, we compared the growth of B16/IL2.4 with parental controls in vivo. in contrast, expression of IL2 abrogated the growth of B16/IL2.4 tumours. we examined tumour growth in nude mice treated with antiIL2R antibody to remove NK cells and any residual T cells that developed extrathymically. as expected, the B16/IL2.4 tumours also grew progressively in a fashion very similar to parental B16 tumours. mice were injected with 2 105 B16 or B16/IL2.4 cells. lines indicate the growth of tumours in individual mice. the end indicates that the mice were killed or had died during the course of the experiment. mice with no palpable or clearly measurable tumour were still clearly present by gross examination at day 14. at this timepoint, mice inoculated with the same number of parental B16 tumour cells would often need to be killed because of progressive tumour growth. the B16/IL2.4 tumours were also analysed by whole mount histology on day 28. mice were injected with 1 106 B16 or B16/IL2.4 cells. the tumours were processed into single cell suspensions. the frequency of T cells or NK cells was normalized to the weight of the tumour to correct for differences in tumour size. at day 21 these mice were challenged with parental B16 tumours. the original dormant tumours remained dormant for the duration of the experiment. the one dormant tumour that grew out had lost expression of interleukin2 (IL2). dotted lines indicate growth of challenge tumours in naive mice. solid lines indicate growth of tumours in mice harbouring dormant tumours. naive mice were also challenged with the same dose of parental B16 cells. IL2 can enhance proliferation and differentiation of NK and T cells22,23. in naive mice even in the absence of antigen it can expand CD8 memory phentoype T cells in vivo that can provide protection against Listeria or vaccinia virus. despite the presence of IL2 in the B16/IL2.19 tumours, the presence of IL2 does not result in dominance of the Tregcell activity. despite the presence of Treg cells, the B16/IL2.19 tumours exhibit slower growth compared with parental B16 tumours. IL10 was upregulated in the B16/IL2.19 tumours. recent work has suggested that IL10 could also have beneficial antiviral and antitumour effects. the levels of IL2 may be sufficient to overcome the suppressive effects of the Treg cells. tumour cells were still detectable after 100 days after tumour inoculation. data from immunedeficient mice suggested tumour control could be mediated either by T cells or to a lesser extent by NK cells. how this tumour dormancy is established remains to be determined. local expression of IL2 in B16/IL2.4 tumours alters the tumour microenvironment and enhances tumour effectors. local expression of IL2 in B16 tumours alters the tumour microenvironment and enhances tumour effectors Paracrine delivery of cytokines has been extensively studied. IL2 has striking effects on number and types of immune cells in the tumour. the presence of extremely low levels of IL2 in the context of viable B16 tumours results in increased numbers of T cells and NK cells in the tumour. early reports indicated that IL2 can have beneficial antitumour effects in the B16 model. lower levels of IL2 resulted in slower tumour growth. higher levels resulted in longterm tumour control. despite the presence of Treg cells, the B16/IL2.19 tumours exhibit slower growth compared with parental B16 tumours. this may reflect a limiting amount of IL2 in the B16/IL2.19 tumours. the presence of IL2 in the B16/IL2.19 tumours does not result in dominance of the Tregcell activity. antiviral and antitumour effects.50,51 Interestingly, it has been suggested that at different times during an immune response, effectors might be differentially susceptible to the influence of Treg cells. IL2 may be sufficient to overcome the suppressive effects of the Treg cells. dormancy could be maintained by lymphocytes themselves through eliminating tumour cells. this could be controlled by factors such as the IFN that the immune cells produce. a systemic antitumour immune response in challenge experiments in mice with \u2018dormant\u2019 tumours is not fully protective. in vivo, local IL2 expression affected the immune effectors within the tumour microenvironment of viable tumours. however, the presence of IL2 in the tumour microenvironment affected tumour growth and the antitumour immune response. in vivo, expression of IL2 may drive differentiation toward T effector cells rather than toward the development of memory T cells24. it should also be possible to combine immunotherapy with new molecularly targeted therapies as well as conventional therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapy, in clinically significant ways."}
