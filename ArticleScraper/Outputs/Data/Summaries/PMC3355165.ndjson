{"summary": "no new adjuvants have been approved in the united states since the 1930s. only recently has the European Heads of Medicines Agencies licensed the MF59, AS03 and AS04 adjuvants for use with the fluad\u00ae, FendrixTM and CervarixTM defined vaccines. helminth-derived molecules have potent regulatory or stimulatory effects on the immune system of their mammalian hosts. some of these molecules contain pathogen associated molecular pattern that bind to endocytic-pattern recognition receptors on antigen presenting cells. three helminth products have also been reported to act as adjuvants in experimental vaccine models. a 19 aa synthetic peptide (GK-1) from Taenia crassiceps cysticerci has induced increased levels of anti-influenza antibodies in both young and aged mice. a recombinant Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated protein-1, rOv-ASP-1, has been shown to be a novel protein adjuvant that can increase specific immune responses in mice. rOv-ASP-1 fused to 3 copies of the highly conserved extracellular domain of the H5N1 influenza M2 protein sequence was able to induce high levels of M2e-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a. rOv-ASP-1 enhances humoral and cellular responses after immunization with rRBD of SARS-CoV in mice. the IgG and IgG2a responses in mice vaccinated with rRBD were significantly higher only after the second boost. the anti-rRBD IgG response was significantly higher in the presence of CpG only after the second boost. comparison of the rOv-ASP-1 and the Alum induced rRBD antibody responses after the second boost revealed similar levels of IgG1. a mixed Th1/Th2 response with CpG (IgG2a/IgG1 = 0.94) and rOv-ASP-1 (IgG2a/IgG1 = 2) with a predominance of Th1-associated antibodies. rOv-ASP-1 can induce a more balanced antibody response with some bias towards a skewed Th1-associated antibody response. neutralizing antibodies found in sera from mice immunized with rRBD plus the Alum adjuvant (NT50 = 164,666) were not significantly different than in neutralizing antibodies found in vaccinated mice. infection of 293T/ACE2 cells by SARS pseudovirus was determined. rRBD and its CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes in vaccinated mice were very low [31], [32], and therefore we are confident the results obtained using the pooled spleens are a good representation of what would have been the outcome if we had used individual mice. cytokine levels in the culture supernatants of the murine splenocytes were similar to those produced by stimulation with the full length rRBD in mice vaccinated with rRBD+rOv-ASP-1. the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant enhances immune responses in a sequential influenza vaccine. ASP-1 had endpoint total anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibody titers of 1256,000\u20131512,000 at the time of the priming with the second vaccine. similar IgG1 and IgG2a humoral immune responses against the influenza viruses were induced in the mice vaccinated previously with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant. 7,500 486,000 162,000 (RBD+rOv-ASP-1)+(flu+rOv-ASP-1) 1,458,000 243,000 243,000 PBS+flu 729,000 486,000 54,000 PBS+(flu+rOv-ASP-1) 1,458,000 729,000 243,000 Figure 3. anti- HAs antibody responses in vaccinated mice were compared to those generated in mice after primary immunization with the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant. anti-RBD IgG titer rRBD + 50 g 50 g 100 g 500 g rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 rOv-ASP-1 the anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibody response titers to the adjuvant itself were lower in the NHPs than we might have expected based on the data in mice. the range in all the 4 immunized macaques was 1100\u20131800 after first boost, 1800\u201311,600 after second boost and 1200\u20131;1600 after the third boost. using 293T/ACE cells were determined in the presence of antisera from each of the RBD-immunized NHPs. only a significant TNF- response was obtained in NHPs immunized with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 or CpG ex vivo. we previously reported that rOv-ASP-1 could effectively induce a mixed, but Th1-skewed immune response against rS and rRBD in immunized mice. the responses in mice vaccinated with rRBD in the presence of Alum were significantly higher only after the second boost. only the IgG1 response was significantly higher in the presence of CpG after the second boost. rOv-ASP-1 and the CpG induced rRBD antibody responses. rBd model performed differently depending on adjuvant, e.g., a skewed Th2 response with Alum (IgG1/IgG2a = 3.3) and rOv-ASP-1 (IgG2a/IgG1 = 2). we tested the antisera from the 10-day post-second boost immunization. we found that mice immunized with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 contained a very high titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection by SARS-CoV pseudovirus. there was no significant recall induction of the Th2 IL-4 or IL-5 cytokines by rRBD. notably, the responses to rRBD when formulated with CpG are more IFN- and IL-17A dominant with diminished IL-2, TNF-, IL-10 and IL-6 responses. iFN- 30 42825 55017 290176 TNF- 141 1024 12013 4049 IL-17A 41 2922 191 57 Responses to N60 (CD4+ epitope) iFN- 31 726139 5058 17028 TNF- 140 11114 1382 2726 IL-17A 71 286 4333 2019. mice that were previously immunized with rRBD in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 had endpoint total anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibody titers of 1256,000\u20131512,000 at the time of the priming with the second vaccine. similar IgG1 and IgG2a humoral immune responses against the influenza viruses were induced in the mice vaccinated previously with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant. the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant enhances humoral and cellular responses in NHPs vaccinated with rOv-ASP-1. the rOv-ASP-1 as an adjuvant enhances humoral and cellular responses in NHPs vaccinated with rRBD of SARS-CoV. all of the NHPs vaccinated with rRBD protein plus 50 g (n = 2), 100 g rOv-ASP-1 (n = 2) or 500 g CpG (n = 1) were evaluated in a rhesus macaque immunization model using rRBD as the target antigen of the SARS-CoV vaccine. immunization with 50 or 100 g of the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant exhibited dose-dependent efficacy in the induction of RBD-specific antibodies in the two macaques per group. the anti-RBD endpoint tiers were much higher in the NHP that was immunized with CpG, but the differences in the NT50 titers were less prominent. the macaques that were immunized with CpG had a higher NT50 titer at 16,392. Neutralizing antibody titers induced in vaccinated NHPs. 1,056 rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 (50 g) 1,292 rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 (100 g) 1,350 rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 (100 g) 1,129 Discussion Vaccines remain the most effective means of preventing or eradicating infectious diseases. there are ongoing efforts to apply active immunization approaches to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases and cancer [35], [36] alum is the only adjuvant licensed in the u.s. for general use in humans. but it is not effective in stimulating Th1 and/or cytotoxic T cell responses to pathogens. some adjuvants are being developed in clinical testing. rOv-ASP-1 could effectively induce mixed RBD- or HA-specific Th1/Th2 antibody associated responses, when used as an adjuvant with a recombinant subunit vaccine or as an addition to a commercial flu vaccine (FLUVIRIN; using 20% of the dose recommended for human use). the preexisting anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies induced by a previously administrated rOv-ASP-1-based vaccine do not have a significant effect on the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 when formulated in a subsequent vaccine. the pilot immunogenicity studies in the NHPs have provided us with extremely valuable \u201cProof of Principal\u201d information in an outbred primate model. the rOv-ASP-1 protein adjuvant can be further developed for human use. the yeast expressed adjuvant will support future development of a scalable process for downstream manufacture of rOv-ASP-1. this includes the development of critical biochemical and biophysical assays. animal housing and environmental conditions met all applicable standards. blood was collected retro-orbitally for mice and from the femoral vein using the Sarstedt S-Monovette system for NHPs. the recombinant plasmid was linearized with SacI digestion. the highest expression clone was selected by scale up culturing. the expression of rOv-ASP-1 with 6 His and c-myc tag at C-terminus was induced with 0.5% methanol. mice were boosted twice 3 weeks apart with 10 g/mouse of rRBD protein in PBS, rOv-ASP-1, Imject Alum or CpG. all mice were bled retro-orbitally under anaesthesia prior to immunizations and 10 days post injections. rhesus macaques were bled before immunization and 7 days post-immunization. all mice were bled before immunization and 7 days post-immunization. the plates were blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS-Tween (0.05%) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. serial diluted sera in binding buffer (1% non-fat milk in PBS-T) were added into each well in duplicate and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the antisera-virus mixtures were added to 293T cells expressing the SARS receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (293T/ACE2) in 96-well plates. the infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h, followed by lysing the infected cells using cell lysis buffer included in the luciferase kit (Promega) cells were stimulated with or without PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 g/ml) the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. the secreted cytokines were quantified using the mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 BD Cytometric Bead Array Kit (BD Biosciences) the data were analyzed using GraphPad version 5.01 for Windows. unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or Mann-Whitney test was used. one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was considered appropriate for multiple comparisons. purified rOv-ASP-1 was tested negative in a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. purified rOv-ASP-1 contained 0.25 endotoxin units per milligram of the protein. yeast codon optimized Ov-asp-1 cDNA sequence without region encoding the N-terminal signal peptide. 100 g yeast-expressed rOv-ASP-1 per mouse was as effective as 25 g per mouse of the E. coli expressed rOv-ASP-1. both eliciting after two immunizations end point anti-OVA IgG titers of 125,600. so, the E. coli or the yeast expressed rOv-ASP-1 at their optimal quantities can be used intermittently with assurance. mice were immunized with rRBD protein in PBS, rOv-ASP-1, Imject Alum or CpG. mice were bled retro-orbitally before immunizations and 10 days post injections. sera were stored at 80\u00b0C. the macaques were bled before immunization and 7 days post-immunization. the macaques were bled before immunization and 7 days post-immunization. PBMCs were purified for in vitro assays. sorbance at 450 nm was measured using SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) end point titers were defined as the highest dilutions giving an A 450 measurement of 0.1. this cutoff value represents the value of mean optical density (OD) plus 2 standard deviations (SD) of 10 normal mouse serum samples tested at 1100 dilutions. the neutralization of SARS pseudovirus is presented as 50% neutralizing antibody titer (NT50) splenocytes were harvested from the immunized mice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were plated at 4105 cells into 96-well U-bottom culture plates for in vitro stimulation with 5.0 g of rRBD. PBMCs were isolated following a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Sigma) single-cell suspensions were then stimulated at 4105 cells with 5 g of rRBD, N50 or N60 peptides, or PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 g/ml) for positive control."}
