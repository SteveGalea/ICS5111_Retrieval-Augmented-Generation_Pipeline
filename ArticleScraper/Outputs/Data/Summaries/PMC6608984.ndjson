{"summary": "infection of mammalian cells by vesicular stomatitis virus results in a profound shut-off of host cell gene expression. the host cell shut-off occurs at the level of mRNA transcription through inhibition of RNA polymerase II by the viral-encoded matrix protein (M) [1\u20133]. the M protein also forms a complex with ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1) and nucleoporin 98 (N viral transcriptase copies the N-RNA template into 5 monocistronic mRNAs that are structurally indistinct to those of the host-cell with respect to their 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 polyadenylate tail [14\u201320]. the enzymes necessary for mRNA synthesis, namely an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a set of capping enzymes, reside within the viral large protein (L) infection results in the movement of actin mRNA from polysomes containing 12 or more ribosomes to those containing 5. this movement reflects the competition between viral and cellular mRNA for ribosomes and the limited pool of eIF4E. kinetics of host shut-off and viral mRNA accumulation correlate well for many strains of VSV. transcription of the mRNAs from the viral genome appears to contribute to their efficient translation. in this study, we interrogate global mRNA translation in VSV infected cells using RNAseq analysis of the cytoplasmic mRNA transcriptome. mRNA comprises 60% of the cytoplasmic mRNA at 6 hours post-infection. mRNA comprises 60% of the cytoplasmic mRNA at 6 hours post-infection. cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at 2 and 6 hpi for mRNA isolation and polysome profiling. messenger RNA was isolated from fractions corresponding to 80S monosomes. the viral sequence reads map to all 5 genes, with clear dips in coverage at gene-junctions. the relative reads that map to each viral gene generally diminish with distance from the single 3\u2032 promoter. the abundance of the 5 viral mRNAs at 6 hpi supports the model that viral mRNAs outcompete cellular mRNAs for ribosomes. reads that map to any given cellular gene alter within a relatively narrow range. the relative reads obtained from the polysome fraction mirrored the reads in the total cytoplasmic fraction. the relative abundance of individual cellular mRNAs decreases between 2 and 6 hpi. for the majority of the population of cellular mRNAs, reads were most reduced in the polysome fraction compared to the total cytoplasmic fraction. some cellular mRNAs even showed an increase in reads compared to the total cytoplasmic fraction. this may reflect differences in the movement of cellular mRNAs from large polysomes to monosomes. a global reduction in polysome-associated reads is less than 2\u20133 fold. we also observe an increase in monosome-associated reads with more than half the mRNAs within the population exhibiting a >2-fold increase. for this purpose, we selected the subset of cellular mRNAs that exhibit the largest changes in relative polysome-associated reads at 6 hpi. gene ontology analysis for mRNAs with decreased polysome association was performed using GOseq in R. gene ontology analysis identifies functions in RNA binding, helicase and NTPase activities. at 6 hpi the cytoplasmic abundance of cellular mRNAs correlate with their polysome association at 6 hpi. mRNAs with increased polysome-associated reads tended to have shorter half-lives, higher GC content, and were typically smaller. the correlation between higher AU content and increased polysome-associated reads was most evident for the coding region and 3\u2032 UTR. mRNAs with increased polysome association (blue) or decreased polysome association (green) at 6 hpi. analysis was performed as in A for cytoplasmic abundance in infected cells. metabolic labeling of viral RNA substantiates defect in gene expression. Fig 5. Effect of suppressing specific host gene function on viral gene expression. a quantitative analysis of the HSP70 and YBX1 bands is shown in the bottom two panels. error bars denote the standard deviation from the mean of 3 independent replicates. eIF3a depletion also reduced cellular translation in uninfected cells. 138 cellular mRNAs exhibit reduced polysome association following VSV infection. DNA-damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) encodes regulated in development and DNA-damage response 1 (Redd1). DDIT4/Redd1 restricts replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. the extent of polysome association observed by our RNAseq analysis is reflected in synthesis of the corresponding host proteins. cellular mRNAs exhibit differential polysome distributions following infection. we pooled fractions that contained 3 or more ribosomes prior to sequencing. dissociation of polysomes with EDTA shifted the mRNA distribution toward the fractions corresponding to free ribosomal subunits. this shift might also explain our finding that HSP70 protein synthesis is relatively unaffected by viral infection. mRNAs with unchanged polysome association following infection. abundance of viral mRNA and suppression of translation initiation will both contribute to the movement of mRNAs toward smaller polysomes. defects in viral mRNA cap methylation do not significantly alter the rate of viral protein synthesis, consistent with a reduced dependence on eIF4E [25]. transcripts from viral mutants defective in cap methylation are translated efficiently in infected cells. eIF4E levels approximately 10-fold using a peptide-conjugated morpholino. depletion of eIF4E decreased the rate of viral protein synthesis in VSV-L1670A infected cells, but not LWT infected cells. this was not due to sequestration of eIF4E by differential activation of eIF4E-BP1 between VSV-L1670A and VSV-LG1607A infected cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at 2 and 6 hpi for mRNA isolation and polysome profiling. messenger RNA was isolated from fractions corresponding to 80S monosomes, or polysomes containing 3 or more ribosomes. relative reads that map to each viral gene generally diminish with distance from the single 3\u2032 promoter. analysis of the sequencing reads that map to cellular genes supports that like the viral mRNAs, the level of reads in the polysome fraction mirrors that in the total cytoplasmic fraction at 2 and 6 hpi. the abundance of individual cellular mRNAs in the cytoplasm and on polysomes decreases between 2 and 6 hpi. relative reads obtained from polysome fraction mirrored reads in total cytoplasmic fraction. relative abundance of individual cellular mRNAs decreases between 2 and 6 hpi. for the majority of the population of cellular mRNAs, reads were most reduced in the polysome fraction compared to the total cytoplasmic fraction. a smaller reduction in reads was observed in the monosome fraction. some cellular mRNAs even showed an increase in reads compared to the total cytoplasmic fraction. cellular mRNAs exhibit the largest changes in relative polysome-associated reads at 6 hpi. for this purpose, we selected those mRNAs that change >2 standard deviations of the mean and thus exceed the 95% confidence interval. we identified 364 cellular mRNAs as candidates for translational upregulation. gene ontology analysis for mRNAs with decreased polysome association was performed using GOseq in R. the pie charts show the distribution of mRNA among the 20 most significant GO Terms. mRNAs that exhibit evidence of positive translational regulation are AU-rich. cellular mRNAs with increased polysome-associated reads tended to have a longer half-life, were typically larger, and were more AU-rich. correspondingly, those with decreased polysome-associated reads tended to have shorter half-lives, higher GC content, and were typically smaller. mRNA characteristics for mRNAs with increased polysome association (blue) or decreased polysome association (green) at 6 hpi. analysis was performed as in A for cytoplasmic abundance in infected cells. a representative histogram of eGFP intensity is shown to the right. a representative histogram of eGFP expression is shown along with the MFI of cells normalized to a non-targeting siRNA control. a quantitative analysis of the HSP70 and YBX1 bands is shown. error bars denote the standard deviation from two independent replicates. we also found that polysome association of the mRNA encoding eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit A increases after infection. DDIT4/Redd1 restricts replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. depletion of DDIT4/Redd1 increased viral gene expression. depletion of DDIT4/Redd1 also increases cellular protein synthesis. YBX1 synthesis decreases more than two-fold (Fig 5D) cellular mRNAs exhibit differential polysome distributions following infection. we pooled fractions that contained 3 or more ribosomes prior to sequencing of the polysome-associated mRNA. dissociation of polysomes with EDTA shifted the mRNA distribution toward the fractions corresponding to free ribosomal subunits. these qPCR data highlight the shift towards smaller polysome fractions for some cellular mRNAs. this shift might explain our finding that HSP70 protein synthesis is relatively unaffected by viral infection. the abundance of viral mRNA and suppression of translation initiation through reducing the pool of eIF4E will contribute to the movement of mRNAs toward smaller polysomes. we previously reported a panel of recombinant VSVs containing amino acid substitutions within the L-encoded mRNA cap methylase domain that are defective in viral mRNA cap methylation. transcripts from viral mutants defective in cap methylation are translated efficiently in infected cells. results of qPCR for each individual polysome fraction are presented as a fraction of the total recovered. depletion of eIF4E decreased the rate of viral protein synthesis in VSV-L1670A infected cells, but not LWT infected cells. this was not due to sequestration of eIF4E by differential activation of eIF4E-BP1 between VSV-L1670A and VSV-LG1607A infected cells. up to 20% of the mRNA cap-structures are guanine-N7 methylated a viral mutant defective in mRNA cap methylation and suppression of eIF4E levels provides evidence consistent with a transition from an eIF4E dependent phase of viral translation to one less-dependent on eIF4E. evidence in support of this model is based on massively parallel sequencing of mRNAs associated with polysomes. viral endonuclease PA-X degrades cellular mRNA which further contributes to the dominance of viral mRNA. degradation of host mRNA through the viral encoded decapping enzymes D9 and D10 also helps the viral mRNAs overwhelm those of the host cell [49, 68, 69]. Earlier work conclude that viral mRNA abundance is not the determinant of host cell shut-off in virus-infected cells. eIF4E levels are suppressed by the suppression of cellular pools of eIF4E. we suspect that this significantly underestimates the eIF4E dependent phase of viral replication. viral mRNAs initially compete with cellular mRNAs and translate in an eIF4E dependent manner. host mRNAs with decreased polysome association included genes with published roles in restricting VSV replication. it is difficult to determine whether this reflects evolution of the virus to contend with the environment in which it finds itself or a bona-fide pro and antiviral effect of a given host protein. the cellular mRNAs that exhibit reduced translation efficiency were shorter, have shorter half-lives and higher GC content. a viral mutant (VSV-MM51R) fails to interact with the nuclear pore complex and exhibits a delayed kinetics of host shut-off. a viral mutant that makes less mRNA than the wild type still exhibits host cell shut-off suggests that shut-off can be achieved with less than the 60% of total cytoplasmic mRNA observed here. additional work will be required to define whether a specific tipping point exists and how this is influenced by other viral strategies such as eIF4E suppression. in the nucleus, >50% of the total mRNA in the cytoplasm is viral. in this case, the viral endonuclease PA-X degrades cellular mRNA. degradation of host mRNA through the viral encoded decapping enzymes D9 and D10 also helps the viral mRNAs overwhelm those of the host cell. eIF4E levels are suppressed 10-fold by the use of a viral mutant partially defective in guanine-N7 methylation. we suspect that this significantly underestimates the eIF4E dependent phase of viral replication since transformed cell lines have higher constitutive levels of eIF4E. host mRNAs with decreased polysome association included genes with published roles in restricting VSV replication. it is difficult to determine whether this reflects evolution of the virus to contend with the environment in which it finds itself or a bona-fide pro and antiviral effect. the cellular mRNAs that exhibit reduced translation efficiency were shorter, have shorter half-lives and higher AU content. the cellular mRNAs that exhibit reduced translation efficiency were shorter, have shorter half-lives and higher GC content. the cellular mRNAs that exhibit reduced translation efficiency were shorter, have shorter half-lives and higher GC content. a viral mutant that makes less mRNA than the wild type still exhibits host cell shut-off suggests that shut-off can be achieved with less than the 60% of total cytoplasmic mRNA observed here. additional work will be required to define whether a specific tipping point exists and how this is influenced by other viral strategies such as eIF4E suppression or blocking host gene transcription. cells were scraped into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in 1X PBS with 100 g ml-1 cycloheximide. cells were pelleted at 300 g for 10 minutes.
