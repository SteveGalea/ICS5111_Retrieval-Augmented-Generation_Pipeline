{"summary": "nucleocapsid protein of RNA viruses is essential for virus assembly. in positive strand RNA viruses, the capsid or nucleocapsid protein is the major, often the only structural protein. the nucleocapsid protein localizes to the nucleolus of infected cells. nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV, Arteriviridae) appears to be essential for optimal virus replication and inhibition of cellular antiviral processes. the successful production of infectious progeny of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, Paramyxoviridae) requires nuclear localization of the matrix (M) protein. the nucleocapsid gene of Coronavirus and Arterivirus is in the last position (3\u2032 end) of these genomes. the nucleocapsid gene of Coronavirus and Arterivirus is in the last position (3\u2032 end) of these genomes. the nucleocapsid gene of Coronavirus and Arterivirus is in the last position (3\u2032 end) of these genomes. nucleocapsid protein of RNA viruses is a structural protein found in a complex with the genomic RNA. the role of genome encapsidation varies across PSVs and NSVs. the protein protects genomic viral RNA against ribonuclease degradation. the nucleocapsid protein of VSV, in association with the P protein, is required for genome encapsidation and transcription. mutations in the nucleocapsid protein bind tightly to the genomic RNA, drives RNA packaging and sometimes serves as a nucleic acid chaperone. is C virus (HCV, Flaviviridae) core protein and the N protein of coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are potent RNA chaperones that can resolve RNA misfolding and promote annealing of complementary sequences. most of the evidence for chaperone activity is from in vitro investigations. the nucleocapsid protein of VSV, in association with the P protein, is required for genome encapsidation and transcription. mutations in its C-terminus resulting in reduction of viral particle production in cell culture. patitis C virus (HCV, Flaviviridae) core protein and the N protein of coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are potent RNA chaperones that can resolve RNA misfolding and promote annealing of complementary sequences. the importance of this function in infection is not clear. the nucleocapsid protein of several NSVs and PSVs localizes in the nucleus or nucleolus of infected cells during infection. this nuclear localization usually takes place early in the infectious cycle as soon as the nucleocapsid protein is translated. the only avenue for transport into and out of the nucleus is via the NE-embedded nuclear pore complexes. the most well characterized NES is the leucine-rich motif recognized by the exportin CRM-1 (e.g., the NES in HIV Rev protein) Importins function by binding NLSs and docking transiently at various \u201cFG\u201d (Phenylalanine\u2013Glycine repeat containing) Nups to effect translocation through it. the best studied nuclear import pathway is mediated by the importin-/1 heterodimer. lus is less well defined, but most likely regulated by cargoes interacting with nucleolar residents. noLSs are short stretches of basic proteins, but there is a high level of variability in the noLSs described to date. CRM-1 has been shown to play an important role in nucleolar localization of small nucleolar RNA molecules. PRRSV nucleocapsid protein possesses NLS, nucleolar retention/localization signal (NoRS/-LS) and NES motifs. the NES motif is located in amino acid residues 10\u201313 (NLS1) and 41\u201347 (NLS2) and works with CRM-1 to facilitate nuclear export. cleolus localization/retention signals are indicated by black open boxes. the sequence of the transport signals is shown in single letter format. sequences in italics are predicted but not yet confirmed. the nucleolus is a multifunctional nuclear substructure that is central to the normal operations of a cell. the nucleolar proteome consists of more than 500 proteins identified so far. some are long term residents, others shuttle between the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cell membrane depending on the metabolic state of the cell. nucleocapsid proteins of some viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family have been shown to undergo transient nuclear localization. the NES is CRM-1-independent, despite being a Leucine-rich motif. the capsid (C) protein of several members of the Flaviviridae family localize to the nucleus of infected cells using NLSs. the flavivirus C protein is small enough to diffuse across the NE. studies have shown that it uses active nuclear transport pathways to localize to the nucleus. 42GP43substitution into A42-43 eliminates nuclear localization ability in mosquito and mammalian cell lines. GP motif is conserved in dengue, Kunjin, and Hepatitis C virus C proteins. hepatitis C virus C protein has been found in the nucleus in the C-terminally truncated form. most transport through the NPC is mediated by members of the importin superfamily. most transport through the NPC is mediated by members of the importin superfamily. the best studied nuclear import pathway is mediated by the importin-/1 heterodimer. anosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form, to importin-1, or homologs, to effect dissociation of the import complex. nucleocapsid proteins of viruses belonging to genus Arterivirus localize to the nucleolus. nuclear import of the LDV nucleocapsid protein is facilitated by a monopartite NLS motif, 38KKKK41 (Figure 2A) the NES motif is located in amino acid residues 10\u201313 (NLS1) and 41\u201347 (NLS2) and works with CRM-1 to facilitate nuclear export (Pei et al., 2008). nucleocapsid proteins of arteriviridae and Coronaviridae are shown schematically. numbers under the schematics indicate position of amino acid residues, nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are indicated by solid black filled boxes, nuclear export signals (NESs) are indicated by hatched boxes. sequence of the transport signals is shown in single letter format, with essential residues in bold. the nucleocapsid protein of IBV has been shown to associate with fibrillarin and nucleolin in the nucleolus. the nucleolus is a multifunctional nuclear substructure that is central to the normal operations of a cell. the nucleolar proteome consists of more than 500 proteins identified so far. the nucleocapsid protein is predominantly cytoplasmic in infected cells. the protein sequence contains three putative NLSs and a putative NES. a bipartite NLS and putative NES appear to be functional. the nucleocapsid protein is contained within 70TGILISILSLF80. the NES is contained within residues 425SENELPRLGGKEDRRV440. a dashed-line box indicates flanking sequences that have a role in nuclear import and retention. the C protein does not localize to the nucleus of mosquito cells. the nuclear localization is required for successful replication in mammalian cell lines. the GP motif is conserved in dengue, Kunjin, and Hepatitis C virus C proteins. nucleocapsid proteins may have non-structural roles in modulation of nuclear processes. nucleocapsid proteins may localize coincidentally to the nucleus/nucleolus. the resultant cell cycle arrest/delay would be conducive to higher virus replication. the importance of the nuclear functions of the core protein in flavivirus infection is demonstrated by the inability of some flaviviruses to replicate in enucleated cells. both the Dengue and HCV C protein interact with heterogeneous nuclear RNP K, possibly to regulate host cell transcription, thereby freeing cellular machinery for viral RNA synthesis. the innate antiviral response is one of the earliest responses of the host to viral infection. MV nucleocapsid protein inhibits the nuclear translocation of STATs. MHV nucleocapsid protein interferes with the IFN induced 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase RNase L pathway. it can replace the IFN antagonist activity of E3L protein in a vaccinia virus. nucleocapsid protein generally has Lysine (K) or Arginine (R) rich RNA binding domains. these motifs may serve the dual purpose of mediating nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein coincidental to their main function. other possibilities include association with ribosomal proteins, and passive diffusion. sid redistributes fibrillarin and delays cytokinesis to divert biosynthetic resources from the dividing nucleus to the cytoplasm. the resultant cell cycle arrest/delay would be conducive to higher virus replication through both redirection of biosynthetic machinery for viral replication. a similar cell cycle arrest has also been observed in other coronaviruses. molecular patterns (e.g., viral RNA or dsRNA) are recognized by cellular helicases retinoic-acid-inducible protein I and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5. IFN- mRNA is exported out of the nucleus to induce a secondary cellular response in an autocrine and paracrine manner. this leads to activation of a second cascade of events involving several effectors and transcription factors nucleocapsid protein inhibits IFN production via direct interaction with TRAF-associated NF-kB activator binding kinase (TBK1), thus interfering with the TBK1 mediated phosphorylation of IRF3. nucleocapsid protein generally has Lysine (K) or Arginine (R) rich RNA binding domains (to associate with viral genome), which resemble nuclear transport signals. other possibilities include association with rib ribosomal proteins associate with rRNA to form ribosomal subunits. nucleocapsid protein:ribonucleotides stoichiometry may serve a specific viral purpose by maintaining the nucleocapsid protein:ribonucleotides stoichiometry in the cytoplasm. ctin and Mifepristone are compounds shown to reduce infectious virus titers of several viruses that exploit host nuclear transport machinery. mutations that disable the nuclear/nucleolar localization function should result in viruses that replicate. mutating the NLS of RSV M protein leads to reduced replication fitness, supporting the viability of such an approach. nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of enveloped RNA viruses has potential as a target for the development of live-attenuated vaccines or antiviral drugs. inhibition of its localization could negatively impact on the production of infectious viral particles and cell-to-cell spread."}
