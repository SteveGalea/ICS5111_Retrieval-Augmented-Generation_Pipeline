{"summary": "a novel coronavirus has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory illness. this new virus belongs to group C -coronaviruses. the genome contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) the major difference between NCoV and these bat coronaviruses is in the region between the spike and the envelop genes. the nearest human coronavirus related to NCoV is SARS-CoV [3-5]. this virus was responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. a total of 12 laboratory confirmed cases of NCoV have been reported to WHO. the first 9 of these cases have been from the Middle East. the most recent 3 cases (1 fatal) were in individuals living in UK. the report of the isolation of a new coronavirus from the case led the medical team to test for the new virus. the test came positive and the case was reported to the WHO on 22nd September [18] 4th November no new case was reported during October. the patient was in hospital for approximately a month, but recovered from his respiratory and renal illness. he was discharged in the week of 18th November. all 3 cases were from a single family and were related to case 4 [22]. the HPA confirmed the diagnosis of two further cases, one on 13th February [28] and one on 15th February [29]. both cases were family members of case 10 and neither had any recent travel history. the patient had pre-existing medical conditions, which may have made him more susceptible to respiratory infections [27]. the index case is thought to be a 70-year-old grandfather admitted to a hospital in Riyadh with severe respiratory illness. his two sons took in turns to stay by him during his illness. in spite of all supportive care, the patient died of renal failure. two of the cases subsequently died of multi-organ failure. clinical features associated with the novel coronavirus All of the cases had one thing in common: they suffered from severe respiratory illness which was not due to the known viral or bacterial causes. the most common initial symptoms were reported to be fever, cough and shortness of breath. none of the cases in the Jordanian cluster had renal failure. the novel coronavirus is the 6th member of the human coronaviruses. it can lead to serious lower respiratory tract infection and renal failure. a number of pertinent questions remain unanswered: does NCoV represent an interspecies jump of a bat coronavirus? the author declares that he had no competing interests. the patient was hospitalized on 31st January and died on 10th February."}
