{"summary": "EBOV particles are internalized by macropinocytosis and traffic through endosomes. the 19-kDa GP is cleaved by cysteine proteases to generate a key 19-kDa form. EBOV begins to enter the cytoplasm only after a 30-min lag. a key rate-defining step is arrival in an NPC1+ late endosome-lysosome (LE/Lys), a hybrid organelle also referred to as an endolysosome. we also found that endosomal entry of severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus also displays a late entry profile, commencing only after colocalization with NPC1. plasmid encoding SARS S19 (SARS S containing a truncation of 19 C-terminal amino acids) was a gift of Shutoku Matsuyama and Fumihiro Taguchi (NIID, Tokyo, Japan) green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab5 and GFP-Rab7 were gifts of Marino Zerial (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Dresden, Germany) a total of 25 g washed VLPs bearing EBOV GP-V5 (in 2 mM CaCl2, 10% sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was treated with 0.25 mg/ml thermolysin (VitaCyte) containing 0.5 mM CaCl2 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the resultant 19-kDa EBOV VLP internalization and EBOV VLP, HIV pseudovirion, and influenza entry assays were conducted as described previously (16). for EBOV VLP entry assays, 40 to 50,000 target cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. after 18 to 24 h, when the cells were 90 to 100% confluent, VLPs (5 to 10 l) were diluted in chilled Opti-MEM I (OMEM; Gib the average final percentages of entry for VLPs with EBOV GP, VSV G, and LCMV GP were 43%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. for experiments involving pseudovirions bearing no glycoprotein showed no cytoplasmic entry. for experiments involving pseudovirions bearing SARS S, the target cells were BSC-1 cells continually passaged with a nonenzymatic cell disassociation reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) anti-HA MAb (diluted 1:500 in 3% BSA-PBS++) for 45 min on ice. cells were washed twice with 1 ml chilled PBS++, pelleted, and stained with Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFAM; Boston Bioproducts) for 15 min at RT. 88-tagged anti-rabbit antibody IgG (Molecular Probes) in saponin solution (1:1,500 dilution) was added and the coverslips were incubated for 30 min and washed as described above. a total of 20 to 30 images of cell fields with internalized VLPs were then acquired (per sample) and analyzed using the ImageJ software. cells were washed, primary antibodies were detected with (1:1,500) anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 and (1:1,500) anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) for 45 min at RT. all antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA-PBS. after being washed with PBS and distilled and deionized H2O, coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) cells were washed twice with PBS++, lifted with trypsin-EDTA, and quenched with BSC-1 medium. 200,000 to 300,000 of the transfected cells were seeded into 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes. ct solution mixed up and down twice and immediately added to the cells. Pearson's correlation coefficients between each ROI and cat L probe fluorescence (red) were calculated using the same software. a total of 1,332 GFP-Rab5 endosomes, 1,238 GFP-Rab7 endosomes, and 1,314 NPC1-GFP endosomes were analyzed. the plasmid encoding Zaire EBOV GP tagged (C-terminal end) with a V5 epitope was a gift of Paul Bates. the plasmid encoding SARS S19 (SARS S containing a truncation of 19 C-terminal amino acids) was a gift of Shutoku Matsuyama and Fumihiro Taguchi (NIID, Tokyo, Japan) a total of 25 g washed EBOV GP-V5 VLPs were then resuspended in 10% sucrose-HM (1:100 starting volume of medium) the reaction was quenched with 500 M phosphoramidon (Sigma-Aldrich) the resultant 19-kDa EBOV GP VLPs were kept on ice until use. Pseudovirions bearing SARS S were produced in HEK293T cells. the cells were continuously passaged with a nonenzymatic cell disassociation reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent S protein cleavage during pseudovirus production. the average final percentages of entry for VLPs with EBOV GP, VSV G, and LCMV GP were 43%, 56%, and 52%, respectively. for experiments involving pseudovirions bearing no glycoprotein, the target cells were BSC-1 cells continually passaged with a nonenzymatic cell disassociation reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS++) for 15 min on ice, incubated with site A (HC3) anti-HA MAb. cells were washed twice with 1 ml chilled PBS++, pelleted, and stained with Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFAM; Boston Bioproducts) for 30 min on ice. coverslips were incubated for 30 min and washed as described above. a total of 20 to 30 images of cell fields with internalized VLPs were acquired. a total of 20 to 30 images of cell fields with internalized VLPs were then acquired. primary antibodies were detected with (1:1,500) anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 and (1:1,500) anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) for 45 min at RT. all antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA-PBS. images were then collected with a confocal microscope with a 100 objective. cells were washed twice with PBS++, lifted with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. cells were then seeded into 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes. 200,000 to 300,000 of the transfected cells were seeded into 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes. image analysis was performed on images that were taken 2 to 3 min after addition of the probe. individual endosomes were selected as regions of interest (ROI) using NIS-Elements. Pearson's correlation coefficients between each ROI and the cat L probe fluorescence (red) were calculated using the same software. filamentous VP40-based VLPs expressing VSV G and LCMV GP were shown to be similarly shaped filaments as those bearing EBOV GP. spherical and relatively small X:31 influenza virus particles (100-nm diameter), known to enter the cytoplasm through LEs (14), also commenced cytoplasmic entry sooner (15-min lag) than VLPs bearing EBOV GP. LCMV GP, and EBOV GP were 22.5 (3.5), 40.0 (7.1), 55.0 (8.7), and 73.3 (12.9) min, respectively. EBOV GP VLPs begin to enter the cytoplasm slowly, even slower than influenza and LCMV, late-penetrating viruses that enter the cytoplasm through LE (15, 27) OV GP (open triangles, dashed line) were bound to BSC-1 cells. similar results were observed in experiments comparing LCMV GP and EBOV GP-mediated entry into BSC-1 cells. X:31 influenza virus particles (diamonds, solid line) or EBOV GP VLPs (triangles, dashed line) were bound to BSC-1 cells at 4\u00b0C. EBOV GP preprimed to 19-kDa GP (form that binds to NPC1) entered the cytoplasm with the same kinetics as those bearing either full-length GP or GP. EBOV GP does not require exposure to unusually low pH to induce entry. each data point is the average from four samples (from two experiments performed in duplicate) errors bars indicate SD. none of the data points are statistically different at P values of 0.05. each data point in panels A and B is the average from six samples. asterisks in panels A and B indicate a higher value for EBOV GP than for the 19-kDa GP. a higher value indicates, if anything, lower sensitivity to the lysosomotropic agent. 1+ LE/Lys is a rate-defining step for EBOV GP-mediated entry. the data further suggest that once within NPC1+ LE/Lys, the conditions are suitable for relatively rapid fusion triggering. EBOV GP remains sensitive to E64d over the same time course as it remains sensitive to the fusion-inhibiting agent bafilomycin. this suggests that the final E64d-sensitive factor acts at, or temporally just upstream of, virus-endosome fusion, perhaps by cleaving 19-kDa GP to a final fusion-ready state (30, 31) EBOV GP VLPs were bound to BSC-1 cells at 4\u00b0C and then warmed to 37\u00b0C. at the indicated times, cells were treated with bafilomycin (200 nM) or E64d (2 M) cells were then processed for EBOV GP VLP cytoplasmic entry. in cells that do not express trypsin-like proteases on their surface, SARS CoV enters the cytoplasm through endosomes. fusion is triggered by cat L cleavage of the SARS S (fusion) protein. however, the class of endosomes that serve as portals for SARS entry has not been determined. the rate of SARS entry appeared somewhat slower than the rate of EBOV GP-mediated entry. the results in Fig. 9 and 10 uncover unexpected similarities in the timing and location of entry of SARS, a coV, and a filovirus. representative images from the 15-min, 60-min, and 120-min time points are shown. yellow arrows indicate areas of overlap. evidence that NPC1+ LE/Lys have higher cathepsin activity than earlier endosomes. cat L activity was detected in endosomes marked with NPC1-GFP. the latter population may represent lysosomes. the latter population may represent lysosomes. averaged percent colocalization was calculated after analyzing 33 cells. we propose that Ebola and SARS enter the cytoplasm later than other \"late-penetrating viruses\" we further propose that they do so to access high levels of endosomal cathepsins. EBOV GP VLPs enter the cytoplasm later than particles bearing VSV G, LCMV GP, or influenza HA. mCherry-VP40 and -lactamase-VP40 are used to monitor VLP internalization from the cell surface and trafficking within the cell. mCherry-VP40 is used to monitor VLP internalization from the cell surface. filamentous LCMV GP VLPs expressing VSV G and LCMV GP initiated cytoplasmic entry after a significantly shorter lag (15 min) than those bearing either full-length EBOV GP or EBOV GP. average half-times for entry mediated by VSV G, influenza HA, LCMV GP, and EBOV GP were 22.5 (3.5), 40.0 (7.1), 55.0 (8.7), and 73.3 (12.9) min, respectively EBOV GP VLPs are internalized quickly but begin to enter the cytoplasm only after a 30-min lag. VLPs bearing either VSV G (A) or EBOV GP (B) were bound to the surface of BSC-1 cells at 4\u00b0C. after being washed, the cells were warmed to 37\u00b0C and assayed. 31 influenza virus particles (diamonds, solid line) or EBOV GP VLPs (triangles, dashed line) were bound to BSC-1 cells at 4\u00b0C. cells were then warmed and processed and analyzed for cytoplasmic entry of EBOV GP VLPs. both the lag before the onset of and the half-life for entry of EBOV GP VLPs are independent of the final extent of entry observed in individual experiments. EBOV GP entered the cytoplasm with the same kinetics as ones bearing either full-length GP or GP. a 30-min lag before initiation of EBOV GP-mediated entry is not rate-limited by internalization kinetics, particle size or shape (Fig. 3), or a need for unusually low endosomal pH. VLPs bearing the indicated form of EBOV GP were bound to the surface of BSC (A), 293AD (B), or SNB19 (C) cells at 4\u00b0C, warmed, and assayed for cytoplasmic entry. data points in each panel are the averages from duplicate samples, and error bars indicate SD. a higher value indicates, if anything, lower sensitivity to the lysosomotropic agent. evidence that EBOV enters the cytoplasm soon after arrival in NPC1+ endolysosomes (LE/Lys) in the cells studied, NPC1+ LE/Lys contain relatively high levels of CD63, Lamp1 and Lamp2. cells were analyzed for cytoplasmic entry (open triangles, dashed line) as described for Fig. 1 and for colocalization with NPC1 (solid line), as described in Materials and Methods. data are the averages from six experiments. the data are from two separate experiments shown on the left (A, B) and right (C, D) in another experiment, high colocalization was also seen between Lamp2 and NPC1. processing of EBOV GP to 19 kDa fosters binding to NPC1 (10) and potentiates GP for in vitro conformational changes (29). we previously showed that entry mediated by the 19-kDa EBOV GP remains sensitive to the cysteine protease each data point is the average from eight samples. only one point showed a statistical difference: *, P 0.05. the same result was obtained in 293AD cells. EBOV GP VLPs are found within the lumen of NPC1+ endosomes. we predicted that entry mediated by EBOV GP would occur with a time course similar to that seen for LCMV and influenza virus (Fig. 2; i.e., with an 15-min lag) to test our prediction, we used HIV-lam pseudovirions expressing either EBOV GP or SARS S. HIV pseudovirions bearing either SARS S (solid diamonds, solid line) or EBOV GP (open triangles, dashed line) were processed and analyzed for cytoplasmic entry. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between EBOV GP and SARS S at the indicated time point. cat L activity was detected using a fluorescent cat L probe in conjunction with live-cell microscopy. we first analyzed cat L activity in endosomes marked with GFP-Rab5 (Fig. 11A), which comprise both early endosomes (Rab5+/Rab7) and transitional endosomes (38\u201341) bSC-1 cells were transfected to express GFP-Rab5, GFP-Rab7, or NPC1-GFP, incubated with a cat L activity probe. shown are images from the respective movies at 2 to 3 min after the addition of substrate for cat L activity (red) and endosomes (green) marked by GFP-Rab5 (A), GFP-Rab7 (B), or NPC1-GFP (C) text in green boxes indicates markers of the respective organelles (pink circles). a high proportion of cat L activity recorded in Rab7+ endosomes likely stems from le/Lys (Rab7+/NPC1+), due to the high degree of colocalization of Rab7 and NPC1. EBOV enters the cytoplasm later than LCMV and influenza virus, viruses that enter the cytoplasm through LE. a key rate-defining step for EBOV entry appears to be arrival in NPC1+ LE/Lys. we also found that NPC1+ LE/Lys have higher levels of cat L activity than LE. two other shared features have recently been revealed for SARS and EBOV. entry of both viruses is restricted by (i) similar interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (43) as well as by (ii) some of the same FDA-approved drugs (16, 23, 44) the only post-ACE2 binding requirement for SARS endosomal entry is cat L activity. we propose that SARS travels deep and late into the endocytic pathway to or through NPC1+ LE/Lys to access sufficiently high levels of cat L to trigger fusion. EBOV. NPC1 serves as a high-affinity intracellular receptor for a proteolytically primed form of EBOV GP (4\u20137) a post-receptor (NPC1) binding event in 19-kDa GP may trigger EBOV fusion. a major difference would be that whereas SARS S engages its receptor, ACE2, at the cell surface, primed (19/20-kDa) EBOV GP first binds its receptor (NPC1) in LE/Lys. both EBOV and EBOV enter the cytoplasm after a noticeably longer lag, and with considerably slower overall kinetics, than either influenza virus or particles bearing the GP of LCMV. thepsins also appear to enhance rotavirus entry (59) the current model for SARS entry posits that binding to its cell surface receptor, ACE2, induces conformational changes that potentiate the S glycoprotein for a fusion-inducing proteolytic cleavage event (33, 34, 36). in many cells, it is thought that cell surface trypsin-like proteases enact this cleavage (35, 46) but in cells that lack such proteases, the fusion-activating cleavage EBOV GP can be produced by in vitro treatment of EBOV GP with cat L (29, 30, 50) or chymotrypsin (31), can also bind to NPC1 (51). the 20-kDa EBOV GP can also be produced by in vitro treatment. NPC1+ LE/Lys may possess a lipid composition and/or other factors required for optimal EBOV fusion (16) there appear to be unexpected similarities in the location, timing, requirements for, and restrictions of entry of SARS and EBOV."}
