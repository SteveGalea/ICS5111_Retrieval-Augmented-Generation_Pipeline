{"summary": "black tea extract (BTE) consisting primarily of flavanol compounds called theaflavins could inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 infection in cultured A549 and vero cells. results were determined by viral DNA extraction followed by plaque assays, adsorption assays, and electrophoresis of PCR products. theaflavins are a dimer of different catechins in green tea extract. green tea extract contains a relatively high amount of catechins compared to black tea. green tea extract contains a relatively high amount of catechins as compared to black tea. concentrated theaflavin extracts made from black tea can be just as effective as catechins. it is believed that the high number of hydroxyl groups of theaflavins is responsible for its antioxidative properties. it has been found that theaflavins are capable of inhibiting certain types of cancer [10], as well as inhibiting viruses, including bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus [11], HIV-1 [12,13], and three different subtypes of as, VA, USA] were cultured until confluent in 1X Ham's F-12K nutrient media, Kaighn's modification with 2 mM L-glutamine, supplemented to contain 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 g/mL gentamicin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cell viability assays A549 and Vero cells were plated in 6-well plates. after 1 h the BTE was removed by aspiration and the cells were washed with PBS. cells were then stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemocytometer. plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. media from each well was harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. cells were treated with 100 L of one of the 10 concentrations of BTE solution. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour and rocked every 15 minutes. media from each well was harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. plates were then overlaid with a nutrient medium-containing agar. adsorption assay equal volumes (100 L) of BTE solution and a virus suspension, containing virus to yield 20\u201330 plaques per well, were placed in microcentrifuge tubes. samples were placed on monolayers of A549 and Vero cells in 6-well plates and the virus was allowed to adsorb in the presence of the extract. unabsorbed solutions were aspirated, and nutrient medium-containing agar was then added to each well. plates were incuba 100 L of GHSV-UL46 was mixed with 100 L of BTE solution in a microcentrifuge tube. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. a nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer was used following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. primers were designed to prime different regions of the HSV-1 genome. sequence, melting temperature (Tm) and size of amplicons of forward and reverse primers are listed in Table 1. human epithelial (A549) cells were cultured until confluent in 1X Ham's F-12K nutrient media, Kaighn's modification with 2 mM L-glutamine. recombinant strain of HSV-1, GHSV-UL46 contains the sequence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the tegument protein pUL46. A549 and Vero cells were plated in 6-well plates, grown for 24 h. different concentrations of BTE (14 mM to 0.014 nM) were added to the wells. after 1 h the BTE was removed by aspiration and the cells were washed with PBS. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour. 200 L of each mixture was added to a separate well on a 6-well plate. plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour and rocked every 15 minutes. media from each well was harvested and used to infect fresh monolayers of vero cells (70 - 80% confluent) plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour and rocked every 15 minutes. media from each well was harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. plates were then overlaid with a nutrient medium-containing agar. Virus adsorption assay equal volumes (100 L) of BTE solution and a virus suspension, containing virus to yield 20\u201330 plaques per well, were placed in microcentrifuge tubes. mixtures were placed on monolayers of A549 and Vero cells in 6-well plates and the virus was allowed to adsorb in the presence of the extract. unabsorbed solutions were aspirated, and nutrient medium-containing agar was then added to each well. plates 100 L of GHSV-UL46 was mixed with 100 L of BTE solution in a microcentrifuge tube. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. a nanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer was used following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the primers were designed to prime different regions of the HSV-1 genome. sequence, melting temperature (Tm) and size of amplicons of forward and reverse primers are listed in Table 1. black tea extract concentrations up to 14 mM have no significant effect on cell morphology A549 and vero cells were exposed to ten-fold dilutions of BTE. however, slight changes in morphology were observed for Vero cells at the highest concentration (data not shown). values represent SD. cell proliferation and viability assay indicates that BTE is not toxic to A549 and Vero cells. in this assay, only live cells can reduce WST-1, which is light red, to formazan, which is dark red. thus, the higher absorbance level is indicated by a darker color, which correlates to the number of living cells. treatment of virions with various concentrations of BTE for one hour resulted in significantly reduced viral titers, as compared to untreated virus. for vero cells infected with untreated HSV-1, there was a fluorescence from cells infected with untreated HSV-1. panel A: A549 cells inoculated with HSV-1 treated with 1.4 mM BTE, taken 12 hours post-infection. panel C: A549 cells infected with HSV-1 treated with 1.4 mM BTE, taken 24 hours post-infection. PCR amplification of BTE-treated HSV-1 infected A549 and Vero cells indicates that the replication of viral genes for glycoprotein D, GFP, and VP11/12 is reduced following the intensity of viral DNA products obtained after infection with untreated HSV-1 (column 2) was greater than that of HSV-1 treated with 0.14 M, 1.4 M, or 0.14 mM BTE (columns 3 \u2013 5). the intensity of viral DNA products obtained after infection with untreated HSV-1 (column 2) was greater than that of HSV-1 treated with 0.14 M, 1.4 M, or 0.14 mM BTE. infected Vero cells either untreated (column 2) or treated with 0.14 M, 1.4 M, or 1.4 mM BTE (columns 3 \u2013 5, respectively) four assays were performed to determine if treatment with BTE interfered with viral adsorption in A549 and Vero cells, either in part or in whole. A549 cells were exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. black tea extract concentrations up to 14 mM have no significant effect on cell morphology A549 and Vero cells were exposed to ten-fold dilutions of BTE. trypan blue assay results for BTE cytotoxicity in A549 cells. results indicate the percentage of live or viable cells as compared to the total number of cells for each sample. values represent SD. cell proliferation and viability assay indicates that BTE is not toxic to A549 and Vero cells. plaque assays were conducted to test the effect of BTE on HSV-1. virions with various concentrations of BTE for one hour resulted in significantly reduced viral titers, as compared to untreated groups. at 24 hours post-infection, there was still a significant amount of fluorescence from cells infected with untreated HSV-1. for Vero cells infected with untreated HSV-1, there was a significant amount of fluorescence 36 hours post-infection. for vero cells infected with increasingly higher concentrations of BTE showed decreasing levels of fluorescence. PCR was used to compare the relative levels of total DNA produced by infection with untreated and untreated HSV-1. there was approximately a 75% reduction in the concentration of DNA in cells following treatment with 1.4 mM BTE. gel electrophoresis of the PCR products from DNA resulted in visible bands on the gel corresponding to viral genes for glycoprotein D (gD), GFP and pUL46. column 1 contains the DNA ladder, with visible bands identified to the left in base pairs (bp). column 2 and 5, 3 and 6, 4 and 7 contain DNA amplified with primers for the HSV-1 gD and pUL46 genes. 549 cells exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. A549 cells were treated with BTE before being exposed to HSV-1. black tea extracts have previously been found to block the production of free radicals and inhibit the growth of cancerous cells. a green tea catechin, EGCG, has already been shown to inhibit HSV-1. theaflavins are more stable at pH 7 than EC and EGCG. fluorescent microscopy and plaque assays demonstrated that BTE significantly inhibited the infectious cycle of HSV-1 in cultured cells. treatment with BTE for one hour significantly reduced viral titers but did not inactivate the virions. BTE concentrations up to 1.4 mM can be used to treat cells infected by HSV-1. lower cost of BTE, as compared to pure theaflavins, make it attractive for consideration as a safe and effective antiviral agent. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
