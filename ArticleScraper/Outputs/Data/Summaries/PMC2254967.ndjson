{"summary": "Purpose Human endonucleases are integral to apoptosis in which unwanted or potentially harmful cells are eliminated. the rapid turnover of ocular surface epithelium and microbial colonization of the eyelids are continual sources of DNA in tears. extracellular endonucleases have unique characteristics that differ from other known human endonucleases. TL is the principal endonuclease in human tear fluid. tear film acts in concert with corneal and conjunctival epithelium. lipocalins are known to have endonuclease activity in vitro. the enzymatic activity of lipocalins is conferred by a conserved LEDFXR domain of the Serratia marcescens Mg2+-dependent nucleases. the specific activity of TL is three orders of magnitude less than DNase I. the amount of DNA in tears was determined by extrapolation from a standard curve of a serially diluted 18-mer M13 primer solution (100 g/ml) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. tears were diluted 2.125 fold in the assay mixture. nuclease activity observed with chemical inhibitors is presented as a percentage of the activity observed in the absence of inhibitors. plasmid DNA was isolated and extracted with phenol:chloroform (1:1) followed by chloroform. oligo (dT) \u2013cellulose column was equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol. a nuclease active fraction eluted at 75\u2013150 mM NaCl and was concentrated centrifugally, Centricon-10 (Amicon, Bedford, MA) the phosphoryl groups at the ends of DNA chains were removed by pretreatment of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. the phosphoryl groups at the ends of DNA chains were removed by pretreatment of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. dsDNA digestion products were run on the denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. ssDNA digestion products were analyzed in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. tears were collected from the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac. pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 1mM CaCl2, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 g sc pUC19 plasmid DNA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a volume of 20 l. reaction products were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. the fractions containing the major peak of activity were analyzed by SDS tricine gel electrophoresis and further purified as previously described for TL [15] the fractions containing the major peak of activity coincided with protein peaks containing lactoferrin and lysozyme. the flow-through fractions containing nuclease activity were isolated. the gels were stained with ethidium-bromide. nuclease activity appeared as clear areas against a brightly stained background of DNA. the gels were washed in 5% SDS for 1 h. oligodeoxynucleotide, 32-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, was eluted from a 25% polyacrylamide gel and labeled at the 5\u2032 end through treatment with [-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. both single- and double-stranded DNA templates were subjected to nuclease digestion by TL and the minor tear endonuclease oligogreen dye assay provides a measurement of the amount of DNA in freshly collected tears. oligogreen dye assay provides a measurement of the amount of DNA in freshly collected tears. lactoferrin in tears is important since lactoferrin has DNase activity in human milk [20,21]. this result suggests a paucity of either the isoforms\u2019 conferring activity or histidyl bound copper ions required for activity [20]. silver stained gel reveals other proteins without nuclease activity in this sample. lactoferrin, apparent molecular weight of about 82 kDa, was removed from the minor endonuclease fractions by chromatography with ConA-Sepharose (Figure 3B, lane 2). tear endonucleases in tears show maximum activity in hydrolyzing plasmid DNA in 50 mM NaCl. activity of the minor endonuclease was reduced from maximum activity by about 45\u201355% compared to about a reduction of 25\u201340% for TL. both TL and the minor endonuclease are Mg2+ dependent nucleases. there is scarce activity in the presence of Ca2+ alone. neither enzyme was affected by Co2+ concentration. the minor tear endonuclease is active with Mg2+ alone. this is different from two human intracellular DNase and DNAS1L2. TL and the minor endonuclease are synergistically activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. DNAS1L2 is considered an acid endonuclease and may have a role in inflammation. but little is known about this enzyme [29]. both human tear endonucleases have greatest activity at physiologic pH. the tear endonucleases are both sensitive to aurintricarboxylic acid and ZnCl2 but a different concentrations. the activity of TL was not abrogated by NiCl2. the minor endonuclease was only inhibited at a concentration greater than 1 mM. d to 3\u2019 (lanes 1, 3) or 5\u2019 (lanes 2, 4) end-labeling with (lanes 1, 2) or without (lanes 3, 4) pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase. plasmid DNA was separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. oligonucleotide digested by tear lipocalin and EndoA. lane designated M shows oligonucleotide sizing markers. size of single strand digestion products differ for the enzymes. a mechanism for extracellular DNA catalysis could counter viral propagation by destroying the viral DNA outside of the intracellular caspase mechanism. as the major endonuclease of tears, TL may have a role in the prevention of viral propagation by transformation. the oligogreen dye assay provides a measurement of the amount of DNA in freshly collected tears. the fluorescence enhancement of the dye bound to DNA is measured, ex=480 nm and em=520 nm. the results are plotted on a standard curve of oligonucleotides () of known concentration. pUC19 human tears (diluted 1:5) were removed from the reaction mixture at successive 15-min. intervals (Lanes 1\u20136); Lane 7 shows sc pUC19 incubated only. the forms of the plasmid are indicated as relaxed (r) and supercoiled (sc) 66 kDa protein remained in the sample with the minor endonuclease. oligo-dT chromatography was used for further enrichment of the minor endonuclease fraction. disulfide reduction did not affect the position or activity of the minor endonuclease in the zymogram. both endonucleases in tears show maximum activity in hydrolyzing plasmid DNA in 50 mM NaCl. the activity of the minor endonuclease was reduced from maximum activity by about 45\u201355% compared to about a reduction of 25\u201340% for TL. the activity of the minor endonuclease (A) and TL (B) in the presence of MgCl2 (), CaCl2 (), or CoCl2 () as well as MgCl2 () is shown in these graphs. the standard deviations of all points varied between 10%\u201315%. TL and the minor endonuclease are synergistically activated by aurintricarboxylic acid, Zn2+, and Co2+. the characteristics of the tear endonucleases appear unique compared to other known human endonucleases. both human tear endonucleases have greatest activity at physiologic pH. activity decreases rapidly outside the physiologic range. effects of known DNase inhibitors on TL and the minor endonuclease are shown in Figure 7. TL and the minor endonuclease catalyze DNA hydrolysis to produce 3\u2032-OH/5\u2032-P ends. the 5-ends were labeled regardless of alkaline phosphatase pretreatment. the 5-ends could be labeled only after the removal of phosphoryl groups. dideoxy sequencing gel electrophoresis was performed on the digestion products. the majority of the digestion products were less than 8 bp and 26 bp with TL and the minor endonuclease. the electrophoretic cleavage patterns in the double strand hydrolysis indicate sequence preferences for the three enzymes. a 211 bp PCR product was digested by TL (lanes 1, 2, 3), DNase I (lanes 1\u2019, 2\u2019, 3\u2019), or the minor endonuclease (lanes 1\u201d, 2\u201d, 3\u201d) in 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively. varying intensity of the bands at the sequences shown reflect different rates of cleavage related to relative sequence preferences for each of the three enzymes. the absence of the major human extracellular nucleases in tears, DNase I and DNase X, serves to heighten the importance of TL in degrading foreign DNA."}
