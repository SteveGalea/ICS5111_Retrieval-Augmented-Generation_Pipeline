PP2C is typical of proteins for which we were unable to detect any consistent change in distribution in adenovirus-infected cells. however, for PIK3-p87 and ribosomal protein S15a, we did see some enrichment in the nucleolar compartment that could account for the apparent increase in detection in the nucleolus analyzed. candidate proteins RBM4 and eIF6 were both nucleolar antigens in uninfected cells. on the other hand, eIF6 became more diffuse with reduced nucleolar location but without specific exclusion from the DBP-rich centers. nop132 maintained its apparent nucleolar location with no detectable depletion from the nucleolus to other compartments. the top row of images is representative of the location of FLAG-tagged Nop132 fusion protein in >80% of cells examined. adenovirus infection causes depletion of ribosomal proteins of the 40 S subunit and, to a lesser extent, the 60 S subunit. this pattern was not observed in viral infection. adenovirus has been shown to eventually affect ribosomal RNA export (2). adenovirus induces a specific removal of UBF from the nucleolus. SILAC data point to depletion of UBF and B23.1 during viral infection. exportin 5 is known to export adenovirus VA RNA, competing with cellular microRNA export. novel proteins examined by microscopy show a clear nucleolar localization in uninfected cells. hPOP1 is normally involved in rRNA processing (42, 55) and mislocalization may reflect data showing that adenovirus eventually inhibits rRNA processing during infection. hnRNPU, and SFPQ are all known to be involved in adenovirus mRNA metabolism. hnRNPA2/B1 weakens the case hnRNPA2/B1 plays a role in viral mRNA metabolism. adenovirus does directly modulate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. a further set of proteins apparently enriched in the nucleolus were not detected by microscopy. a protein may be enriched in the nucleolus but still be below the level of detection by microscopic methods. adenovirus specifically targets aspects of the nucleolar antigens. this may well reflect the observation that adenovirus protease cleaves cytokeratin 18 during infection, leading to altered cytoskeletal structure. confocal microscopy provides the first detailed analysis of changes in the human nucleolar proteome after infection with a human pathogen. confocal microscopy provides a powerful new tool for understanding viral host cell interactions in a broad context and is a positive step toward a systematic understanding of virus host cell interactions. adenovirus infection induces a change in the nucleolar proteome. it induces a much more limited and targeted effect on the nucleolar proteome. adenovirus infection does not induce dramatic changes in the nucleolar proteome at this 18-h postinfection time point. in virally infected cells, nucleolar levels of the RNA polymerase subunits and transcription factor UBF were affected differently. this is consistent with previous observations during adenovirus infection where UBF was depleted from the nucleolus.
