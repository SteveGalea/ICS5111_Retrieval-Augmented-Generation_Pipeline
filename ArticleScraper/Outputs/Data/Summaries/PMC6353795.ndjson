{"summary": "LRTIs represent a leading cause of human mortality and morbidity, causing annually over 3 million deaths worldwide. about 80% of LRTI cases are caused by viruses (2). adenovirus infections account for 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and for nearly 290,000\u2013650,000 deaths worldwide each year. effective vaccines against LRTIs include inactivated/fragmented seasonal vaccines against influenza type A and type B viruses such as Influvac\u00ae (16), Vaxigrip\u00ae (17), and Flumist\u00ae(18) live-attenuated vaccines against influenza virus suffer from safety concerns due to their nature. killed pathogen vaccines and virus-derived subunit vaccines induce weaker immune responses and often require the use of an adjuvant. nano-sized materials can be obtained from biological sources and/or synthetic. nanoparticles can be administered via sub-cutaneous and intramuscular injections. nanoparticles can penetrate capillaries as well as mucosal surfaces. IgA dimers are secreted via polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) at the mucosal surface. nanoparticles incorporating antigens can exert a local depot effect. nanoparticles can exert a local depot effect, ensuring prolonged antigen presentation to immune cells. nanoparticles and the Respiratory Tract Immune System are promising antigen carriers and immune cell activators for vaccination. the respiratory mucosa represents the primary site for invasion and infection by a virus whose replication occurs in the ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract (URT) nanoparticles have been designed to mimic respiratory viruses in terms of size, shape and surface property. nanoparticles should be preferably positively charged. nanoparticles are used to protect antigens/epitopes and deliver them to NALT. e-functionalized self-assembling unit forms nanoparticles decorated with antigen. a promising formulation strategy is the intranasal spray, which delivers conveniently and safely the nanovaccines directly to the respiratory mucosa. a promising formulation strategy is the intranasal spray, which delivers conveniently and safely the nanovaccines directly to the respiratory mucosa. nanoparticle formulations have recently revealed promising results against respiratory virus infections. nanoparticle formulations have recently revealed promising results against respiratory virus infections. ideTM Gel 01 (95) Ferritin 12.5 Influenza (H1N1) M2e \u2013 (96) Q11 \u2013 Influenza (H1N1) Acid polymerase \u2013 (97) OTHERS VLP 80\u2013120 Influenza (H1N1) Hemagglutinin \u2013 (98) 80\u2013120 Influenza (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) M2e \u2013 (99) 80\u2013120 RSV F protein et G glycoprotein PLGA can be engineered to form nanoparticles capable of encapsulating different types of biomolecules and release them sustainably over time. these nanoparticles can encapsulate antigens and prevent degradation over 4 weeks under physiological conditions. PLGA-NPs promote antigen internalization by APCs and facilitate antigen processing. self-assembling protein nanoparticles and VLPs are structures obtained from the oligomerization of monomeric proteins. the protein building blocks are mostly obtained through recombinant technologies and are considered safe for biomedical applications. these M2e-functionalized nanorings induced local production of mucosal antibodies and led to mice protection (95). these N-nanorings are interesting for intranasal delivery of antigen due to their similarities with respiratory viruses in term of size and structure (sub-nucleocapsid-like superstructures) inorganic nanoparticles can be described as complex hybrids materials with an inorganic core and an organic outer shell (148, 149) the most commonly used for vaccination are gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) peptide consensus M2e of influenza A viruses with non-native cysteine residue at the C-terminal end could be attached on the AuNPs via thiolate\u2013Au chemistry. resulting M2e-AuNPs was administered to mice with CpG (cytosine-guanine rich oligonucleotide) adjuvant, triggering a fully protective immune response against the influenza virus PR8 strain (161). intranasal vaccination of nanoparticles generates specific IgA antibody in the URT. there are still limited studies on non-human primates, thus making nanoparticle's fate difficult to predict in a human URT."}
