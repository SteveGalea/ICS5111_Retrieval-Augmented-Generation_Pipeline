{"summary": "a cross-sectional survey was conducted in three countries: china, Pakistan and Vietnam. the infection control guidelines were developed to be in line with the recommendations from the world health organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. in the Vietnamese guidelines the recommendations correspond with the WHO suggestions only. the efficacy of both surgical masks and respirators is still being debated in the literature. previous observational and experimental studies have reported that masks and respirators may protect HCWs from respiratory infections. data collection was undertaken between March and September 2013. participants a range of stakeholders from the three countries were identified. participants were only included in the study when full written consent had been received. both closed and open ended questions included in the survey. the questionnaire was pilot tested in one country, and then further refined. the risk of these diseases is assumed to be higher among HCWs. two researchers (AAC and HS) reviewed all data and prepared a list of themes and subthemes separately. a final list of themes and subthemes was then collectively reviewed and applied to whole dataset. data were double checked for errors. participants were only included in the study when full written consent had been received. a structured questionnaire was developed based on previous studies. TB was selected as an example of a chronic but highly infectious disease. TB has a long incubation and infectious period. extended use was defined as decontaminating masks or respirators. the majority of the documents are targeted at healthcare providers. only the Chinese policy includes information about the regulation and certification processes for respirators. the use of masks/respirators is only briefly discussed in the policy. participants from all three countries confirmed that they were using masks according to a risk classification. the description of low- and high-risk situations varies in the guidelines. paper, cloth and surgical masks are all recommended for low-risk activities. the'reuse' of masks and respirators is not recommended in any guidelines. despite the development of guidance documents, participants felt that the guidelines are rarely followed. in low-risk situations, various products are being recommended by all three countries. however in high-risk situations, surgical masks and respirators are commonly recommended in all three countries. droplet and contact is considered primary mode of transmission for influenza. paper and cloth masks are not recommended by the WHO and the CDC. they were listed in the policies from all three countries. cloth masks may be the only option available to HCWs in some situations. the respirators are required to be marked with \u2018Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en\u2019 (CE) in Australia, the AS/ NZS 1716 standard regulates the respirator use. in low/middle income countries, barriers such as lack of resources, government motivation and technical expertise may impact on the introduction of similar regulations. the CDC recommends that extended use and reuse should be balanced against the risk of infections. the number of virus particles isolated, the length of virus survival, effect on mask material and HCWs\u2019 compliance are important factors to consider."}
