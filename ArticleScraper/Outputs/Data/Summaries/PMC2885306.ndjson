{"summary": "we recently used haplotype-specific sequencing to identify 23 MBL2 haplotypes associated with enhanced susceptibility to several diseases. we applied the same method in 288 and 470 chromosomes from. Gabonese and European adults. the MBL2 genetic polymorphism is responsible for the very common and widespread variation of circulating levels of MBL oligomers. this variation is caused by three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first exon of the gene: MBL2*D (Arg52Cys), *B (Gly54Asp) and *C (Gly57Glu) these mutations have a profound effect on the assembly and stability of the protein. we recently defined 14 additional allelic haplotypes, most of them similar to LYQA or LYPA [2]. Genotypes carrying two copies of either HYPD, LYPB, LYQC or LYPD are particularly associated with the susceptibility and severity of many diseases, as well as with protection against intracellular infections such as tuberculosis, leprosy and leishmaniasis. Clade *1 is represented by LYQA and other haplotypes with Q variants. other clades are represented by intermediate rare haplotypes previously found by our group in Gabon (2 and 3) [2] LYPA (*1A1) or LYPB (*1F1) recombination between HYPD and LYPB would have generated HYPB. we chose to call this haplotype *1A1.1B2 (equivalent to LYPA HYPD), which has not been found. *1B2-l (HYPD).

HYPA (*1B1-h) and LYPB (*1F1-l) are among the *1 haplotypes that reach high frequencies in the European, Asian and Native American, but not in the African population. st values were calculated using the data of Table 2 and of [19]. *1B-derived haplotypes seem to be restricted to Euroasiatic populations. *1J1-h and *3A1-h are intermediate between P and Q containing haplotypes. the LYQC-similar haplotype carries a coding mutation and was found only once in the Gabonese. *4E1-h has a SNP within a glucocorticoid responsive element. -h haplotype in the Gabonese (also called LYPF due to a non-synonymous SNP in the exon 1 region) highest nucleotide diversity was registered in the same windows with Tajima's D peaks (Figure 4C) region S 16 10 13 7 8 10 8 9 6 52.1 51.8 43.4 43.1 32.8 46.9 28.7 1.62 1.42 W 35.6 36.8 31.5 24.3 20.3 37.1 29.4 30.2 17.4 DT 1.044 1.177 0.858 1.963 1.268 0.762 -0.063 -1.146 -0.383 DF 0.129 0.791 -0.783 1.227 1.166 -0.406 1.302 -0.1 1.083 F there are at least 28 segregating sites in the MBL2 promoter and exon 1 sequence [23], and 26 allelic haplotypes were physically defined in this study. a phylogenetic approach that easily accommodates new haplotypes following a logical order. EM and ELB algorithms allowed for 1-2% errors in populations with high nucleotide diversity. the pseudo-Bayesian method performed worse in groups with very high nucleotide diversity. we did not find six of the haplotypes reconstructed by others using the Bayesian method. clade *1 haplotypes are globally distributed, whereas clade *4 haplotypes are more restricted to the african continent. four of the five most ancient haplotypes also belong to clade *1: *1A1-h, *1B1-h, *1C1-l and *1H1-h. the clades *1 and *4 are separated by six mutational steps (P, Q variants), which probably occurred before the human out-of-Africa migration. the most ancient is the g.487G >A variant and the most recent, the g.396A >C variant [2]. the emergence of several recent mutations erased the selective signature at the long haplotype scale, leading to non-significant, although positive, Tajima's D values. the patterns of MBL2 variation at the large temporal scale would thus have been shaped by stochastic evolutionary factors. the PCR products with the primers Hf or Lf with MBLrev and Xf or Yf with MBLrev were 837 and 508 nucleotides. the PCR products with the primers Hf or Lf with MBLrev were 837 and 508 nucleotides. all fragments were sequenced with the amplification primers or with an internal exon 1 sequencing primer, MBLint (5'-GAGGCCAGGGATGGGTCATC-3') new variants (singletons) were verified by reamplification and resequencing. Fisher's exact tests were performed using the DnaSP software package. we calculated the following summary statistics of genetic diversity. the number of polymorphic sites (S), the nucleotide diversity over loci and Watterson's. the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of MBL2 was estimated using a relaxed molecular clock approach. a coalescent prior (Bayesian skyline) was assigned to the tree. a normal prior with mean 1 10-7 and standard deviation of 1 10-7 was used for the rate of evolution. a fragment of 1059 nucleotides was amplified using the forward primers MBLfor (5'-ATGGGGCTAGGCTGCTGAG-3') and the reverse primer MBLrev (5'-CCAACACGTACCTGGTTCCC-3'. the PCR products with the primers Hf or Lf with MBLrev were 837 and 508 nucleotides in length. new variants (singletons) were verified by reamplification and resequencing. Statistical analyses Genotype and haplotype frequencies were obtained by direct counting. deletions were excluded from all analyses. we also tested the 5' upstream regulatory region and the exon 1 coding region separately. a normal prior with mean 1 10-7 and standard deviation of 1 10-7 was used for the rate of evolution. the Markov chain was sampled 50,000 times and 10% of the states were discarded as burn-in. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
