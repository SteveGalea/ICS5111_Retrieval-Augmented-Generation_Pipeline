{"summary": "the mean age was 42.11 years, with a range between 2 years and 70. 14 patients were females (33%) and 28 males (67%). the average transport distance was 121.69 km. the general Intensive Care of San Gerardo University Hospital-Monza has been working as an Italian ECMO referring centre since 1989. up to 2004, patients from different hospitals eligible for ECMO treatment were transported with conventional ventilation techniques by the same hospital\u2019s clinical team. the aim of this paper is to present our 8-year experience on inter-hospital transport of patients with severe acute respiratory failure managed by our mobile transport team. ECMO treatment was based on phone call to our unit for the first evaluation and commence for possible transport activation. criteria for ECMO team activation were: intracranial bleeding/haemorrhage, unable to undergoing to heparinization, negative prognosis, body weight 130 Kg (logistic and equipment restrictions) the white cross of carugate provided us, through a special agreement, all the ambulances used during this study period. the vehicles are based on Renault mechanics (Master model\u00ae) and all the tech features are reported in Table 1. heparinized tubing set (BIOLINE coated\u00ae) by MAQUET Holding GmbH & Co. KG-Germany (mod. PLS-BE or HLS-BE) was used. drainage percutaneous cannula-multistage type was usually positioned in the left femoral vein. percutaneous no multistage-cannula type was used for reinfused blood. a transport with \"conventional\" ventilation was not judged safe, an ECMO support was started on site and the patients were transferred on ECMO. the minute ventilation is gradually reduced through respiratory rate decrease, according to end-tidal CO2 values and later a blood gas sample is performed. the patient was transported from main to cylinders delivery. 14 patients were female (33%) and 28 males (67%). the average transport distance was 121.69 km (SD183.08) with a range between 9 km and 1044 km. the longest distance of 1044 km was performed by transportation of the ambulance and team on the \u2018Hercules C 130\u2019 aircraft provided by the Italian Air Force. in 28 cases (97%) a veno-venous, approach was positioned while in one patient (3%) a Veno-Arterial cannulation was performed for cardiovascular support, due to simultaneous presence of ARDS and cardiogenic shock. in one patient only femoral/jugular (3%) and in 3 paediatric patients (10%) a double lumen jugular cannula 15 FR was placed. the average length of stay in ICU was 26.07 days (27.96 - range 2/116) 33 patients (79%) were discharged alive from SGH. 9 died in the ICU (21%). the ECMO support let to perform respiratory tidal volume less than 6 mL/kg and low respiratory rate. many patients referred for treatment cannot take benefits from this advanced support due to high risks of death related to an ordinary transfer based on standard respiratory setting. the first transport required two days of preparation to assemble the equipment and suitable staff. all equipment\u2019s packs for transport are dedicated to ECMO transports only [24] it makes easier to perform the quality checks and battery packs levels. this is the most responsible in the case of adverse events such as battery failure [25, 26]. the number of adverse events observed in our patients during transport was comparable to those reported by other centers or networks that have implemented similar programs aimed at the centralization of ECMO candidates [7, 8, 12, 30]. Limitations The main limitation of this study is related to retrospective analysis."}
