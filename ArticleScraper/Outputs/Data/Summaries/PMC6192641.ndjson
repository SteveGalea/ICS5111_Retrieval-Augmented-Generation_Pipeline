{"summary": "children with persistent or recurrent fever 36 hours after end of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are considered to be resistant to treatment. concomitant infection does not affect coronary outcome, but it is unknown how it influences the response to IVIG treatment. bacterial co-infection alluded to a trend towards a higher rate of resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), without reaching statistical significance. the accepted definition of IVIG resistance is based on the persistence or recrudescence of fever 36 hours after the end of IVIG infusion. concomitant infection was defined as gastrointestinal symptoms with positive stool cultures for virus or pathogenic bacteria. children with clinical signs of exudative pharyngitis in the presence of a positive group A streptococcus culture were diagnosed with concurrent infection. early CA dilatation was defined as CA dilatation at onset up to one week following KD diagnosis. late CA dilatation when persisting at 3 months\u2019 follow-up was defined as CA dilatation at onset up to one week following diagnosis. delay in IVIG administration was defined as > 10 days between onset of fever and IVIG administration; and IVIG resistance as persistent or recrudescent fever (> 38.5\u00b0C) 36 hours after the end of IVIG infusion. testing for concomitant infection was based on clinical symptoms. s were calculated for the right coronary artery, left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery.
