{"summary": "silver is widely used in industrial applications because of its metallic properties, such as conductivity, and in the medical field due to its antimicrobial effect. silver ions are released from a silver-containing substance and interact with the thiol groups of enzymes and proteins that support bacterial life. metal nanoparticles are commonly synthesized via the reduction of metal salts in a solution [12] or the formation of metal atom aggregates by the heating or vaporization of a metal. the surface of Ag NPs in an aqueous environment is oxidized in the presence of oxygen and protons, and silver ions are released as the surface dissolves. the effective silver ion concentration is maintained in the solution, and the antimicrobial effect will last for a long time [ green processes reduce the generation of harmful byproducts that damage the environment. they also allow for an efficient resource-saving synthesis. some biological materials using green synthesis methods are shown in Table 1. eria 28\u2013122 E. coli [23] 10\u201315 Rhodococcus spp. [24] 44\u2013143 Bacillus thuringiensis [25] 38\u201385 Ochrobactrum anhtropi [26] 8.1\u201391 Pantoea ananatis [27] 41\u201368 Bacillus brevis [28] 105 Bacillus mojavensis [29] Fungi 1\u201320 Aspergillus terreus [30] 8 the bactericidal activity is stronger when the particle size is smaller. an adequate synthesis method is required to generate small-size particles (10 nm) with small dispersions. no harmful material was generated by the synthesis method. borohydride is the most widely used because of its rapid reducing action [12,64,65,66,67]. borohydride is the most widely used because of its extremely strong and rapid reducing action [12,64,65,66,67]. Ag NPs of average size 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 63, 85, and 100 nm were synthesized with good yield and monodispersity. a protective agent is often added to stabilize the produced nanoparticles in a dispersed state. silver nitrate can supply silver ions to synthesis systems and is frequently used as the silver source. irradiation-assisted method contributive to shortening of synthesis time. nanosilver/gelatin/chitosan hydrogels were prepared by radiation crosslinking. ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of ultrasonically-atomized dilute solutions of metal solutes represents a potentially viable means of generating relatively monodisperse particles. ionic silver nanoparticles are synthesised by arc discharge with no added surfactants. ionic silver nanoparticles are synthesised at a rate of 100 mg/min. antibacterial calcium phosphate sub-microspheres were produced with one-pot fabrication. reducetase can produce Ag NPs by enzymatic reduction. but the enzymatic reduction rate is often slow [22]. some biological materials using green synthesis methods are shown in Table 1. the diameter of the Ag NPs is known to influence the microbicidal effect. the diameter of the Ag NPs is known to influence the microbicidal effect. the bactericidal activity is stronger when the particle size is smaller. chemical reduction 50 Hydrogen peroxide was used as reducing agent [12]. 7, 29, 89 Gallic acid was used as reducing agent [50]. 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 63, 85, 100 Sodium citrate was used as reducing agent [52] borohydride is the most widely used because of its rapid reducing action. borohydride is the most widely used because of its extremely strong and rapid reducing action. borohydride is the most widely used because of its extremely strong and rapid reducing action [12,64,65,66,67]. nanosilver/gelatin/chitosan hydrogels were prepared by radiation crosslinking and reduction simultaneously, resulting in a stable and homogeneous distribution of Ag NPs. ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of ultrasonically-atomized dilute solutions of metal solutes represents a potentially viable means of generating relatively monodisperse particles. nanoparticles are synthesized using a physical method that physically pulverizes a metal [22,69,70] compared to chemical methods, thin films and uniformity of nanoparticles distribution can be prepared with the absence of solvent contamination. a stable high energy over a long time should be supplied in physical methods to produce a high yield of Ag NPs of uniform size. small Ag NPs release silver ions from its surface that indicate much higher antibacterial activity than from direct bacterial contact with that surface. silver ions are known to specifically react with the thiol group of cysteine. this may be explained either by the formation of new bonds between the silver ions and cysteine residues in the peptide. ions show a strong microbicidal activity against prokaryotic cells. this is explained by the thick cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. silver ions are presumably trapped in the cell wall and do not reach inside the cell membrane. Ag NPs are effective against cells already infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Ag NPs adhere to the envelope of the HIV virus to prevent cell infection. the proposed mechanism by which Ag NPs lead to cytotoxicity has been considered to at least partially be through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). overproduction of ROS causes impairments in DNA, lipids, and protein, eventually leading to cell death and progressive aging of an organism. at least 600 of the 17,000 cases of EVD in west africa were among HCWs. a large proportion of patients are HCWs, and a large proportion are HCWs. to prevent contact infection, HCWs usually wear protective clothing. chitin/chitosan-based materials have great potential to be used in clothes, plastics, and papers, with various applications such as in doctor/nurse uniforms, security/protection coats, masks, gloves, and counter cloths. the materials have great potential to be used in clothes, plastics, and paper, with various applications such as in doctor/nurse uniforms. various concentrations of Ag NPs on CNFS against E. coli (a) and H1N1 Influenza A (b) should also be considered. the application of the Ag NP/CNFS complex to protect HCWs should be considered. nanocrystalline silver is used as a dressing to manage wounds by providing broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against over 150 pathogens. the special silver additive reduces the possibility of microbial colonization of the product surface. the development of wound dressings with Ag NPs is a representative example. a central venous catheter (CVC) is used intravenously from the body surface. more than 80% of infectious cases have been caused by MRSA. silver is used in dental prostheses and implants, such as artificial dental roots implanted in the jawbone [142]. silver is also used in dental prostheses and implants, such as artificial dental roots implanted in the jawbone [142] materials based on Ag NP technology are expected to contribute to research into protecting HCWs from contact infection during medical treatments on patients."}
