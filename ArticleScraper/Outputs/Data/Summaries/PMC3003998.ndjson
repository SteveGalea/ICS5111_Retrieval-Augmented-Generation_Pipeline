{"summary": "about 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with hepatitis B virus. over 360 million people are persistently infected with HBV. 1 million die each year from HBV-associated liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. the new approaches in treating chronic hepatitis B are urgently needed. the new approaches in treating chronic hepatitis B are urgently needed. viremia negatively influences the virus-specific immune responses. the interaction between programmed death 1 receptor and its ligand PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1) plays an important role to prevent an overreaction of the immune system. this mechanism can contribute to the development of the chronic infection by impairment of the effective antiviral response. regulatory T cells may downregulate HCV- and HIV-specific CD8+. the role of regulatory T cells in HBV infection is still not clear. the liver itself is an organ with tolerogenic properties that might contribute to the immunological tolerance during chronic HBV infection. lipopeptide-based vaccine containing a single cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope derived from HBV nucleocapsid was able to induce a vigorous primary HBV-specific T cell response in nave subjects. however, in HBV chronic carriers, the vaccine initiated only poor CTL activity and had no effect on viremia or HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion. the IC-based vaccine is the only one that entered phase III of clinical trials in chronic hepatitis B patients. it was demonstrated that this vaccine led to decrease of HBV DNA in serum, HBeAg seroconversion, and development of anti-HBs in part of the subjects [78]. woodchucks are a useful preclinical model for designing new therapeutic vaccines in chronic hepatitis B. WHV causes acute self-limiting and chronic infection similar to HBV infection in the pathogenesis and profiles of the virus-specific immune response. aviridae Genus: Orthohepadnavirus [91] Host human woodchuck (Marmota monax) Structure 40\u201342 nm spherical; enveloped nucleocapsid; partially double-stranded DNA genome [22] 42\u201345 nm spherical; enveloped nucleocapsid; partially double-stranded DNA genome [91, 104] Proteins Surface glycoproteins (large-L, medium nearly 100% of chronic infected animals have HCC after 3 years. 5%\u201310% of animals will develop chronic hepatitis. the lack of appropriate methods to evaluate antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses was the serious limitation of this model. the failure of this approach is consistent with the fact that woodchuck lymphocytes do not express the thymidine kinase gene. enables detection of WHV-specific CTLs basing on their granule-dependent effector function. in the woodchuck system, CD107a molecule can be stained by cross-reactive antimouse CD107a antibody. approaches in the woodchuck model were recently described. the natural occurrence of chronic WHV infection in woodchucks allows to evaluate the potentially new therapeutic strategies directly in chronic WHV carriers. several studies of diverse therapeutic vaccinations have been carried out in woodchucks. WHsAg/anti-WHs immunogenic complex and DNA vaccines in combination with lamivudine intramuscular Transient reduction of serum viral loads Lu et al., 2008 [112] Plasmid DNA encoding WHsAg and WHcAg in combination with protein WHsAg/WHcAg vaccine. a large cohort of thirty 1-2-year-old chronically WHV-infected woodchucks was enrolled in the study. at week 10, three animals were vaccinated with 3 doses of serum-purified WHsAg combined with T-helper FIS peptide derived from sperm whale myoglobin. the vaccination induced T-helper responses against WHV antigens, shifting the cytokine profile from Th2 to Th0/Th1 udine and vaccine together led to more sustained and robust lymphoproliferative responses to WHsAg and additionally to WHcAg, WHeAg, and WHxAg. combination therapy delayed the onset of the liver disease and prevented HCC development in up to 38% of treated chronic WHV carriers. two chronic WHV carriers served as lamivudine monotherapy control. lamivudine treatment resulted in only a slight decrease of WHV DNA levels. the triple combination of antiviral treatment, plasmid DNA encoding WHcAg, WHsAg, and wIFN and IC vaccines decreased WHV viral load. one group of animals received 6 immunizations with two-plasmid DNA vaccine. the second group received combination of DNA vaccine together with purified WHV core and surface antigens. the third group remained untreated. vaccines based on recombinant viruses have gained a great interest because of their ability to stimulate robust humoral and cellular immune responses. the utility of those recombinant vaccines in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was not yet evaluated. several clinical trials suggest that gene therapy with traditional retroviral vectors can lead to oncogenesis. the use of another recombinant virus as a carrier of the proteins could be beneficial. adenoviral vectors have several advantages that can be beneficial for potent therapeutic vaccines. the benefits of adenoviral vectors as a vaccine carrier are limited to stable delivery of proteins of interest. adenoviral vectors can directly transduce DCs causing their maturation and upregulation of MHC and costimulatory molecules on their surface. adenoviruses are the most common in the human population. recombinant adenoviruses of nonhuman origin have been recently tested. the utility of the rare human serotypes (e.g., serotype 35) or recombinant adenoviruses of nonhuman origin has been recently tested. recombinant adenoviruses could be a new, more potent approach in treatment of chronic hepatitis B. we will apply DNA prime-AdV boost approach in WHV chronically infected woodchucks in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs and evaluate its therapeutic potential. no effect Fiedler et al., 2004 [163] Helper-dependent AdV expressing woodchuck IFN Intravenous (portal vein) no effect Fiedler et al., 2004 [163] AdV expressing woodchuck IFN in combination with clevudine (L-FMAU) and emtricitabine (FTC) intravenous T-cell infiltration and inflammation in the liver Jacquard et al., 2004 [ a single injection of 1 1012 vp of this vector into the liver's portal vein could inhibit WHV replication by 1 log up to 11 weeks after the treatment. the same approach with helper-dependent AdV encoding woodchuck IFN (wIFN) did not show any antiviral effect. poor therapeutic effect was observed for gene therapy based on both wIFN and wTNF. adenovirus infection alone is sufficient to transiently suppress the WHV replication in chronically infected woodchucks. mIL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced naturally by antigen presenting cells. IL-12 stimulates production of IFN and TNF by T and natural killer (NK) cells. mIL-12 stimulates production of IFN and TNF by T and natural killer (NK) cells. adenoviral delivery of genes for cytokines and other immunomodulators is widely used in cancer therapy. interleukin-12 inhibits the angiogenesis and induces a potent antitumoral immune response by stimulation of IFN secretion. IL-12 is a promising candidate for cancer gene therapy. filtration into the tumor tissue and increased local IFN levels. one of the treated woodchucks received the intratumoral injection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. the tumor size decreased from 8,6 cm3 to 0,5 cm3. the antitumoral effect was associated with the induction of the immune response towards the tumor antigens. the therapy resulted in transient induction of lymphoproliferative responses against WHcAg and WHsAg. this strategy is proven to be more effective than an approach based on using the soluble cytokines. the future design of therapeutic vaccines needs to be considered in nonnave hosts. it is yet not possible to predict how pre-existing infections and immunological backgrounds will influence the effect of therapeutic vaccines."}
