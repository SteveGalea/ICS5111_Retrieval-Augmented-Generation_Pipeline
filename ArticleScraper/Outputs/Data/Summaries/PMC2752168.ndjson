{"summary": "the identification of pili in pathogenic streptococci is a good example of how genomics can lead to the discovery of protein functions and increased understanding of host\u2013pathogen interactions. the pili of gram-negative bacteria are well-described virulence factors. a combination of recombinant pilus proteins was shown to confer protection in mice against mucosal challenge with virulent S. pyogenes isolates. falugi and colleagues have since found that a vaccine comprising a combination of 12 backbone variants could provide protection against over 90% of circulating S. pyogenes strains. fHBP is expressed by all N. meningitidis strains studied. it induces high levels of bactericidal antibodies in mice. fH alone is able to down-regulate complement activation leading to increased bacterial survival. three protective antigens identified by pan-genomic reverse vaccinology [20] were found to contain LPXTG motifs typical of cell wall-anchored proteins. a combination of only three pilin subunits could lead to broad protective immunity in mice [74]. the presence of pili that contain protective antigens in all three principal streptococcal pathogens indicates that these structures play an important role in virulence. fHBP is a component of the Novartis multivalent menB vaccine that entered Phase III clinical testing in 2008 [16],[17]. the administration of human fH to infant rats challenged with MenB led to a greater than 10-fold increase in survival of bacteria. the idea behind reverse vaccinology is to screen an entire pathogen genome to find genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets, such as, for example, bacterial surface associated proteins. pan-genomics aims to identify the full complement of genes in a species, based on the superset of genes in several strains of the same species. analysis of the genome sequences of eight Streptococcus agalactiae strains revealed substantial genetic heterogeneity and the extended gene repertoire of the species. new sequencing technologies will also open up opportunities for monitoring pathogen vaccine escape by screening for evidence of immune selection in the genomes of pathogen populations before and after vaccine selection. similar sequencing strategies could be applied to populations of bacteria taken before or after a vaccine trial in a particular geographical region. immune-competent (BALB/c) and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice revealed a set of 67 genes activated exclusively in response to the host immune system. functional genomics has been applied to many pathogens to identify genes essential to survival or virulence that may be valid vaccine candidates. in vitro identification and screening of the immunome are based on the idea that antibodies present in serum from a host represent a molecular \u201cimprint\u201d of the pathogen's immunogenic proteins. several techniques have been developed to allow the high-throughput display of pathogen proteins, and the subsequent screening for proteins that interact with antibodies in sera. the ultimate aim of researchers in this field of study would be to engineer a single peptide that represents defined epitope combinations from a protein or organism. the study of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins produced by a species is increasingly being applied to vaccine and drug development as a result of the explosion of genome and proteome data. gp160 enables the host to respond to previously subdominant epitopes. high-throughput modification of proteins and their screening for immunogenicity and interaction with antimicrobials is predicted to become more common as techniques evolve. vaccines could generate \u201cself\u201d immune reactions against host epitopes. treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis is associated in certain patients with immune reactivity to the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and an OspA epitope (OspA165\u2013173) has homology to the human lymphocyte function-associated antigen (hLFA)-1L. a recombinant OspA lacking the potentially autoreactive T cell epitope has been proposed the international HapMap Project has identified over 3.1 million SNPs in 270 individuals. the 1000 Genomes Project aims to identify even more genetic variants. the field of vaccinomics investigates heterogeneity in host genetic markers that results in variations in vaccine-induced immune responses. gene-based development of effective vaccines and therapeutics is still dependent on the availability of valid models to measure efficacy and protection against disease. the continued development of animal models with knockout and allele-specific mutations in key components of the immune response will greatly increase understanding of the type of immune response needed to control disease."}
