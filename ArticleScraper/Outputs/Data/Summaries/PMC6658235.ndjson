{"summary": "children with clinical community-acquired pneumonia will be included at a pediatric emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. a new algorithm for the classification of CAP etiology will be used as the reference standard. the majority of respiratory infections in children are caused by viruses. there is a need for new biomarkers that better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia. there is increasing evidence that PCT is superior to CRP as a screening test for serious bacterial infection given the favorable kinetics, including a more rapid response to inflammation. there is a commercially available rapid diagnostic test, FebriDx, that qualitatively detects MxA and CRP at cutoffs of 40 ng/ml and 20 mg/ml respectively. the test has been reported to have 85% (29/34) sensitivity and 93.4% (183/196) specificity to rule out a bacterial infection in patients with febrile respiratory infection. there are several new antigen-based point-of-care tests for respiratory infections on the market. one is the multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC) respi, which uses a 2-photon excitation assay technique to detect 10 bacterial infections. the test gives a preliminary result of strongly positive samples already after 20 min and a final result within 2 hours. the sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses has been reported to be as high as 90% as compared with PCR. the newly included coronavirus and bocavirus has been insufficiently investigated. new studies on clinical CAP etiology in children; (4) evaluating novel RPA-based point-of-care test mariPOC; and (V) assessing long-term complications from CAP. the overarching aim of the Trial of Respiratory infections in children for ENhanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP. there is increasing evidence that PCT is superior to CRP as a screening test for serious bacterial infection given the favorable kinetics, including a more rapid response to inflammation. a WBC count of 15,000/l has been suggested as a cutoff to differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. but critically ill patients will not have an increased WBC count. etiology of childhood CAP has largely relied on early lung-aspirate studies from the 1970s to 1980s. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B has been introduced in most parts of the world during the last two decades. this has also contributed to a shift in the etiology of CAP [21,22] studies have reported an increasing incidence of B pertussis. there have been several deaths in previously healthy infants associated with whooping cough in the last 10 years. there is a need for new studies on CAP etiology in various settings. sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses, such as hMPV and PIV, has been insufficiently investigated. an RPA-based point-of-care test using a paper-based vertical flow microarray technique is currently being developed by our partners at the science for life laboratory. hanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children with clinical CAP. the specific objectives of the study are as follows: the diagnostic accuracy of MxA for viral CAP in children etiology of children with CAP sensitivity and specificity for the mariPOC respi test for the detection of respiratory viruses sensitivity. the exclusion criteria are symptoms of respiratory disease 7 days before enrollment, previous inclusion as a control in the study, or hospitalized during the previous 14 days. the guardians of the controls will be contacted by email/telephone 1 to 2 weeks after enrollment. analyses will be collected in a standardized manner, but mixed with 1.3 ml of saline to mirror the protocol for the mariPOC respi. samples that are not analyzed at the point of care will be stored at 80\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice to minimize degradation of the analytes of interest. if multiple CRP tests are performed, the highest value less than 48 hours from arrival at the emergency unit will be recorded. a small amount of blood will be stored to allow future analysis of, for example, PCT. information about symptoms and danger signs that are rare in a Swedish context will be retrospectively collected from the medical records if deemed necessary. some clinical parameters are routinely recorded multiple times at the emergency unit enrollment. information regarding admission, length of hospital stay, routine clinical examination, radiological, microbiological, and biochemical analyses will be retrospectively collected. a total of 300 cases and 120 controls are estimated to be included in the TREND study. a standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral CAP and bacterial CAP/controls. the prevalence of viral and bacterial CAP was estimated at 45% and 14%, respectively. in our previous study, 35.4% of asymptomatic children tested positive for 1 or more viruses. to include a sufficient number of virus-positive controls, we aim at including 300 cases and 120 controls in the TREND study. study is a prospective observational study of children with clinical CAP and asymptomatic controls. the study will take place at Sachs\u2019 Children and Youth Hospital, Stockholm, which has one of the largest pediatric emergency departments in Sweden. age 1 to 59 months, reported or observed breathing troubles/coughing, observed age-adjusted tachypnea (50 breaths/min in children aged 1-12 months, 40/min in children aged >1 year) exclusion criteria are symptoms of respiratory disease 7 days before enrollment, previous inclusion as a control in the study or hospitalized during the previous 14 days. the inclusion criteria are as follows: age 1 to 59 months, reported or observed breathing troubles/coughing, observed age-adjusted tachypnea (50 breaths/min in children aged 1-12 months, 40/min in children aged >1 year) or chest indrawing, and written informed consent. previously included as a case in the study or hospitalized during previous 14 days. the guardians of the controls will be contacted by email/telephone 1 to 2 weeks after enrollment. cases and controls will be included in the emergency unit. nasopharyngeal aspirates and swabs will be collected from all study subjects. mariPOC respi will be performed on the nasopharyngeal swabs directly at the emergency room at Sachs\u2019 Children and Youth Hospital at the time of enrollment. the test detects the following respiratory agents: influenza A/B, RSV, adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, hMPV, PIV 1-3, rhinovirus, enterovirus, S pneumoniae, H influenzae, B pertussis, and mycoplasma pneumonia allergies, smoking in the family, recent contact with unwell individuals, breastfeeding, preschool, origin of parents, and socioeconomic status will be collected through a standardized questionnaire based on previous studies. information about symptoms and danger signs that are rare in a Swedish context (eg, jaundice, bulging fontanelle, rash, gallop rhythm, weak peripheral pulses, and tender liver mass) will be retrospectively collected from the medical records. classifying etiology in the TREND study is based on the current literature. it will classify children into viral, bacterial, atypical bacterial, mixed viral-bacterial, and undetermined infections. a second, stricter algorithm only considering microbiologically confirmed diagnoses will be used in a complementary subanalysis. for the sample size calculation, we focused on the assessment of MxA levels in cases with viral CAP as compared with cases with bacterial CAP/controls. a standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral CAP and bacterial CAP/controls respectively. the difference in asthma prevalence and the difference in the number of hospital-requiring respiratory infections between cases and controls will be assessed after 3, 7 and (if deemed necessary) 10 years. data will be presented with 95% CI and a P value of.05 will be considered significant. the study was approved by the regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm in June 2017 (ref 2017/958-31). Results The pilot study was performed from June to August 2017 to evaluate the study protocol from a logistical and methodological perspective. 6 out of 9 invited cases and 1 out of 3 invited controls were included. the gold standard for assigning bacterial etiology has traditionally been the detection of bacteria in cultures from normally sterile sites (lung, blood, and pleura) but as sampling from the lung/pleura is infeasible in most cases and blood cultures have limited sensitivity, this approach is of little use in clinical studies of CAP [5]. adenovirus detections will not be considered in the strict algorithm. adenovirus detections will not be considered in the strict algorithm. there is no optimal reference standard for classification of CAP etiology, neither clinically nor in research. a significant proportion of children will not have true CAP, including children with bronchiolitis and asthma. a rapid-acting bronchodilator will be administered to children with wheezing and chest indrawing, according to the PERCH study team. the TREND study aims to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiology in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP presenting at an emergency unit in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Sweden. previous studies on MxA have shown promising results on the role of MxA as a biomarker for viral etiology. the gold standard for assigning bacterial etiology has traditionally been the detection of bacteria in cultures from normally sterile sites. but as sampling from the lung/pleura is infeasible in most cases, this approach is of little use in clinical studies of CAP [5]. PCR positivity will not be considered enough for establishing etiology. detection of viruses other than influenza, RSV, hMPV, and PIV will be considered as viral infections only if the CRP value is less than 20. this rule will not be applicable for adenovirus. a significant proportion of children with bronchiolitis and asthma will not have true CAP. a rapid-acting bronchodilator will be administered to children with wheezing and chest indrawing, as suggested by the PERCH study team. commercial combination point-of-care tests of inflammatory biomarkers are already being developed and some, such as FebriDx and MeMed BV, have shown promise. improved near-patient differential diagnosis is a prerequisite for rational antibiotic use."}
