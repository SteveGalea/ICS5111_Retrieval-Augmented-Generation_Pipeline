{"summary": "he has been associated with the Sabin Vaccine Institute for 12 years. he recently began a new position with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. in 2011, we relocated the laboratories of the Sabin Vaccine Institute to Texas Children's Hospital. this year's annual meeting in Philadelphia has been extraordinary for a number of reasons. this afternoon, I learned from Karen Goraleski that we have broken all meeting attendance records to date. the coming year will be an exciting one with Dr. James Kazura as your new president. the tropical diseases are the most common infections of the world's poorest persons, a group sometimes known as the \u201cbottom billion\u201d. the list of the world's major tropical infections ranked according to estimates of their prevalence in the biomedical literature is shown in. most of the diseases on this list, with exception of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, are also known as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) most of the diseases on this list are also known as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) the NTDs are the most prevalent adverse health conditions among the world's poor living in low- and middle-income countries. malaria heads the list with more than 600,000 people dying annually, mostly children from P. falciparum infection, followed by more than 100,000 deaths annually. malaria and the NTDs have a pivotal role in the world's food crisis. many of the adverse health effects of the NTDs operate through their ability to impair human nutrition. tropical infections can arise from the breakdown in public health infrastructure that result from war. a concept that I believe to be equally important is the effects of tropical infections on promoting war and conflict. tropical diseases are the most common infections of the world's poorest persons, a group sometimes known as the \u201cbottom billion\u201d. a new list of the world's major tropical infections ranked according to estimates of their prevalence in the biomedical literature is shown in. there are approximately 3\u20134 billion cases of tropical infections worldwide. the bottom billion is polyparasitized and therefore infected simultaneously with several tropical diseases. some tropical infections such as hookworm with malaria, schistosomiasis, or strongyloidiasis appear to increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) many of the NTDs are non-emerging infections and have afflicted humankind for centuries. a new list of the world's tropical infections ranked according to the number of persons they kill annually is shown in. malaria heads the list with more than 600,000 people dying annually. tens of thousands of deaths from kinetoplastid infections, amebiasis, dengue, and soil-transmitted helminthiases. together the tropical infections kill more persons than the number of children who die annually from lower respiratory tract infections. together the tropical infections cause almost as many deaths as the number of people who died from HIV/AIDS in 2010. trachoma and onchocerciasis disable agricultural workers. hookworm, schistosomiasis, and malaria produce a \u201cperfect storm of anemia\u201d that reduces productive capacity. a concept that I believe to be equally important is the effects of tropical infections on promoting war and conflict. new cases of sleeping sickness reported for africa during 1927\u20131997. new cases of sleeping sickness reported for africa during 1927\u20131997. a call to eliminate the tropical diseases has been made in the past two decades. lymphatic filariasis has now been eliminated as a public health problem in more than 20 LMICs. ivermectin has resulted in the elimination of onchocerciasis from Mali and Senegal. donated azithromycin (Zithromax\u00ae), together with simple surgeries, facial cleansing, and environmental control, have led to trachoma elimination. the global network for NTDs is supported by the Gates Foundation. the ultimate goal for integrating MDA is to advance the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, and onchocerciasis. the ultimate goal for integrating MDA is to advance the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, and onchocerciasis. the current rate of international giving and NTD control and elimination activities is far from eliminating lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, and onchocerciasis through MDA. an important step would be to persuade the U.S. and British Governments to expand their current donations and possibly persuade other countries in Europe to begin donating. e.g., in areas of high transmission of hookworm infection and schistosomiasis, there are rapid rates of post-treatment re-infection. in many instances, such as single-dose mebendazole treatment of hookworm, MDA is simply not effective even in reducing prevalence. a key point here is that we must expand MDA and international R&D efforts simultaneously. t of the audacious goal is to scale-up the use of existing anti-malaria interventions such as long-lasting insecticide treated nets, intermittent preventive therapy, and treatment with artemisinin-combination therapies. in parallel, we call on the scientific community and the industrial sector to expand R&D efforts to accelerate the development of new malaria drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, insecticides. the Sabin Vaccine Institute is also working to develop new vaccines for intestinal schistosomiasis. a therapeutic Chagas disease vaccine based on discoveries made in the laboratory of Dr. Eric Dumonteil at the Autonomous University of Yucatan is at an earlier stage of development. a leishmaniasis vaccine is under development in collaboration with the national Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health laboratory of Drs. Jesus Valenzuela and Shaden Kamhawi. we have embarked on new collaborations for vaccines to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome with Drs. Sara Lustigman and Shibo Jiang (New York Blood Center) and Kent Chien-Te (University of Texas Medical Branch) and now a new bio the elimination of the 17 major NTDs will require expanded MDA together with the development, manufacture, testing, delivery, and judicious use of the new antipoverty drugs and vaccines. the elimination of the 17 major NTDs will require expanded MDA together with the development, manufacture, testing, delivery, and judicious use. the DCVMN represents a potent force for ensuring manufacture of new antipoverty vaccines for the bottom billion. they will be essential for realizing the vision of this \u201cDecade of Vaccines\u201d that was announced in 2010 by the Gates Foundation. the united states also has extensive poverty with some estimates suggesting that up to 50 million americans now live below the poverty line. our studies have shown that surprising rates of some NTDs travel with poverty in these regions."}
