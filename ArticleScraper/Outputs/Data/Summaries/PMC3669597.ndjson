{"summary": "the protozoan toxoplasma gondii infects almost all warm-blooded animals. bats are reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses, including henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), lyssaviruses, and filoviruses. little is known of T. gondii infection in bats. blood samples were collected from the interfemoral vein, and serum samples were separated and stored at 20\u00b0C prior to use. 68 samples were from GD, 29 from Guangxi Zhuang Nationality Autonomous Region. agglutination test titers 25 were classified as positive. the intervals in the bracket were the seroprevalence confidence limits rounded to the nearest whole number. the 95% confidence limits were calculated using the formula Mean1.96 * Standard Error and Mean+1.96 * Standard Error for the left and right-hand side confidence limits. MAT was performed with a suspension of toxoplasma tachyzoites fixed with formalin as antigen. bat sera were added to the 96-well microtiter plates and diluted 2-fold in phosphate-buffered saline. positive and negative control sera were included in each test. blood samples from the interfemoral vein were collected from the interfemoral vein. serum samples were separated and stored at 20\u00b0C prior to use. seropositive (prevalence %)b 18 (26.5) (17\u201339)c 12 (13.6) (7\u201323)c 3 (13.6) (3\u201335)c 4 (20\u201344)c 3 (15.8) (3\u201340)c Positive males 4 1 1 2 1 Positive females 14 11 2 2 2 MAT titersb 1:25 modified agglutination test titers 25 were classified as positive. the 95% confidence limits were calculated using the formula Mean1.96 * Standard Error and Mean+1.96 * Standard Error for the left- and right-hand side confidence limits. MAT was performed with a suspension of Toxoplasma tachyzoites fixed with formalin as antigen. the plates were shaken for 2 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight without shaking. positive and negative control sera were included in each test. the prevalence in female bats (25.0%, 31/124) was significantly higher than that in male bats (9.7%, 9/93) (p0.05). the higher seroprevalence in Megaderma (26.5%) than in other bat genera may be related to diet. virulence assessment in mice and genotyping of T. gondii isolates from bats will also be carried out in the next experiments. the findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors."}
