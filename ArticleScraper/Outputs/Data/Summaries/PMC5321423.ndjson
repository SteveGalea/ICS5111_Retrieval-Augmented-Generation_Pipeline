{"summary": "adenoviruses (HAdVs) are pathogenic viruses that can cause acute respiratory disease (ARD), acute follicular conjunctivitis, haemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and even death. HAdVs have been classified into seven species (HAdV-A to G), which include more than 64 serotypes. a better understanding of viral genetic changes will improve two HAdV-7 strains identified in separate ARD outbreaks contained a 12-bp deletion in the VA RNA II gene. there is no clear evidence whether the VA RNA II gene mutations contributed to past HAdV-7 outbreaks. there is no clear evidence whether the VA RNA II gene mutations contributed to past HAdV-7 outbreaks. Pure Link Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kits were used to extract nucleic acids. adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected with Seeplex\u00aeRV12 ACE and Seeplex\u00ae Pneumabacter reference genes VA RNA II and E1 were detected using primers VA-F: 5\u2019-GAGCCAGTGCTGCGCGCGCG-3\u2019, VA-R: 5\u2019- TTAGAAACGTCGCGCGCGCGCG-3\u2019.
