{"summary": "MERS-CoV is one of four -coronaviruses found to infect humans. it has emerged as a highly fatal cause of severe acute respiratory infection since April 2012. as of 10 November 2017, there have been 2,103 confirmed cases of infection, including 733 related deaths from 27 countries. three RBD-specific MAbs, D12 and 4C2 (from immunized mice) and MERS-27 (from a naive human phage display library) have highly similar binding patterns in complex with the RBD. m336 and MCA1 interacted more broadly with RBD contact residues largely overlapping the DPP4-binding site (15, 20, 22\u201324) a combination of RBD- and S1-specific MAbs targeting distinct epitopes could prevent emergence of escape mutations in the RBD. a combination of RBD- and S1-specific MAbs targeting distinct epitopes could prevent emergence of escape mutations in the RBD. a higher level of anti-S2 antibody detected in human serum. this suggests that natural infection of MERS-CoV or vaccination with full-length S induces antibodies targeting multiple structural domains of S. we isolated neutralizing MAbs from immunized macaques. JC57-11 and CDC2-C2 have relatively long VH complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) sequences, 23 and 20 amino acids, respectively. JC57-13 and FIB-H1 from macaques and human CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 bound to S1 but not the RBD. CDC2-C2 was the most potent RBD-specific MAb against MERS-CoV EMC. all S1 non-RBD-specific MAbs failed to neutralize 100% of the input virus, reaching no more than 90% neutralization. this phenomenon has also been reported for influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies. MAbs isolated from immunized NHPs and a MERS survivor were assayed by ELISA for binding to soluble receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 protein. RBD-specific MAbs (in red) bound to both RBD and S1 proteins, while S1-specific MAbs (in blue) bound only to S1. JC57-11, JC57-14, and CDC2-C5 neutralized pseudoparticles bearing S from each of eight tested MERS-CoV strains. these MAbs can also neutralize S-pseudotyped particles corresponding to most recent strains from Korea and china. CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 showed no neutralization activity against Hasa14b. murine MAb G2 is the broadest and most potent S1-specific MAb. IC50 neutralization activity was measured against 8 to 11 strains of MERS-CoV S-pseudotyped viruses. CDC2-C2, CDC2-C5, CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 were isolated from a human donor. es that have undergone somatic mutation within the heavy chain do not contact the RBD. those in the light chain make significant contacts with the RBD, including residues Asn 30 and Tyr 50. the CDC-C2 CDR H3 is two residues longer than the m336 CDR. m336 and MCA1 antibodies clash with a neighboring protomer. CDC2-C5 matches well with the JC57-14 mode of binding. m336 and MCA1 antibodies clash with a neighboring protomer. mouse RBD-specific MAbs F11 and D12 make contact with two distinct regions of the RBD at and around residue 509 for F11 and at residues 535 and 536 for D12. this suggests the potential for additive neutralization effects and prevention of escape mutations. the mutation completely or almost completely ablated neutralizing activity by all MAbs except for F11, which was unique in its neutralization specificity. in aggregate, six RBD-specific MAbs have four different patterns of binding to mediate neutralization. the experiment was repeated once to ensure reproducible results. binding competition assays by ELISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) were performed. percent inhibition of analyte MAb binding by competing untagged MAbs is indicated. CDC2-C2 but not CDC2-C5 could block F11 binding. the five non-RBD S1-specific MAbs showed three binding patterns. G2, JC57-13, and FIB-H1 competed with each other. CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 did not compete with each other. hDPP4 mice were challenged intranasally with 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012) at 3 days postinfection, four animals were sacrificed and lungs were collected for analyses. escape mutants were selected by RBD-specific MAbs (CDC2-C2, CDC2-C5, JC57-11, and JC57-14) at passage 10 (P10), escape mutants contained one or more amino acid substitutions within the RBD. the CDC2-C2-, CDC2-C5-, and JC57-11-selected escape mutants contained arginine-to-threonine, glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid, and argin achieving viral resistance to two-MAb combinations was more difficult than selection of escape mutant viruses using a single-MAb-specific MAb. at P10, MAb concentrations under dual-MAb selection were 1.8- to 6-fold lower than their respective concentrations under single-MAb conditions. percentages of viral isolates or cultures containing the indicated mutation are shown in red. serum from immunized rhesus macaques and a convalescent human volunteer was analyzed. anti-RBD and -S1 antibody titers in the human donor were lower than those in macaques immunized with 2DNA/protein or 2protein. a panel of MAbs was generated and selected for further characterization. three MAbs from the macaque JC57 (JC57-11, JC57-13, and JC57-14) were from the same VH germ line (IGHV4-2), but were paired with different VL genes (IGKV3-9, IGKV1-20, and IGKV2S17). two of four MAbs from the human donor (CDC2-C2 and CDC2-A10) used IGHV1-69. all four human MAbs used different VL genes. JC57-11 and CDC2-C2 have relatively long VH complementarity-determining region 3 sequences. CDC2-C2 was the most potent RBD-specific MAb against MERS-CoV EMC. all S1 non-RBD-specific MAbs failed to neutralize 100% of the input virus, reaching no more than 90% neutralization. this phenomenon has also been reported for influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies. the most potent RBD-specific MAb, CDC2-C2, neutralized pseudoparticles representing 10 MERS-CoV strains with high potency. the other three RBD-specific MAbs neutralized pseudoparticles bearing S from each of eight tested MERS-CoV lentiviruses. all three S1-specific MAbs isolated from macaques and the human donor were unable to neutralize the Jordan N3 strain. CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 showed no neutralization activity against Hasa14b (GenBank accession number KF600643.1) these MAbs showed lower neutralization potency than G2. CDC2-C2, CDC2-C5, CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 were isolated from a human donor, JC57-11, JC57-14, JC57-13, and FIB-H1 from an immunized mouse. IC50, IC80, and IC90 neutralization titers for panels A and B. JC57-14 and CDC-C2 are modeled using the MERS spike trimer structure (PDB code 5W9H) bound to a single RBD in the open conformation. CDC-C2 binds to the MERS RBD at an angle 90\u00b0 rotated from JC57-14. the second mode of binding targets the DPP4 receptor-binding site contacting residues 500 to 515 as well as W535 and adjacent residues. the second mode of binding targets the DPP4 receptor-binding site contacting residues 500 to 515 as well as W535 and adjacent residues, predominantly using a gene-encoded heavy chain to bind the MERS RBD. BD at and around residue 509 for F11 and at residues 535 and 536 for D12. BD at and around residues 535 and 536 for D12 can bind to the RBD simultaneously. this suggests potential for additive neutralization effects and prevention of escape mutations. six RBD-specific MAbs neutralize MERS-CoV by interacting with the different residues in the receptor-binding domain. the experiment was repeated once to ensure reproducible results. results from one of the two experiments are shown. CDC2-C2 was blocked by all RBD-specific MAbs, and CDC2-C5 exhibited a similar pattern, except for reduced competition by F11. CDC2-C2 but not CDC2-C5 could block F11 binding (77.96% inhibition by CDC2-C2) CDC2-A2 and CDC2-A10 did not compete with each other despite similar neutralization patterns. results of competition analysis by ELISA and BLI were in full agreement. some discrepancies between the two assays were observed for RBD-specific MAbs. hDPP4 mice were challenged intranasally with 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. at 3 days postinfection, four animals were sacrificed and lungs were collected. hDPP4 mice were euthanized due to severity of disease signs or at 28 dpi. the CDC2-C2-, CDC2-C5-, and JC57-11-selected escape mutants contained arginine-to-threonine, glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid, and arginine-to-glycine substitutions. escape mutations were not detected when CDC2-C2 (RBD specific) and CDC2-A10 (S1 specific), JC57-11 (RBD specific) and JC57-13 (S1 specific) at P10, MAb concentrations under dual-MAb selection were 1.8- to 6-fold lower than their respective concentrations under single-MAb conditions. in some cases, the final (P20) MAb concentration was substantially lower in the two-MAb passage than in the single-MAb experiment (e.g., JC57-13 alone versus JC57-11 plus JC57-13 [Fig. S8]). several anti-RBD MAbs have been reported to neutralize MERS-CoV in vitro. there is a potential risk for virus to escape under selection pressure if only a single site is targeted. mutations in the RBD have been seen in the Bisha1 and Korea002 strains. six RBD-specific MAbs and five non-RBD S1-specific MAbs recognize, in seven ways, the RBD and non-RBD S1 regions of MERS-CoV S. combinations of RBD-specific MAb plus S1-specific MAb or two RBD-specific MAbs targeting different epitopes on S prevented the emergence of escape mutations in the RBD in vitro. CDC2-C2 is our most potent RBD-specific MAb comparable to the most potent published MAbs, m336 and REGN3051 (13, 18). CDC2-C2 can cross-neutralize 10 of 11 MERS-CoV strains isolated in 2012 to 2015 with high potency and partially neutralize the Bisha1 strain. JC57-11 with JC57-13 (one RBD-specific MAb with one S1-specific MAb) and JC57-11 with JC57-14 (two RBD-specific MAbs) also prevented escape mutations. more structural data are needed to determine precise atomic details of epitopes. a panel of murine, NHP, and human MAbs targeting diverse regions of the MERS-CoV S RBD, non-RBD S1 and S2 are valuable reagents for development of passive immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic strategies against MERS. atomic-level structures of S in its trimeric prefusion conformation have recently been solved for several human CoVs, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and human CoV HKU1. all MERS-CoV S genes used for pseudovirus production were cloned into the mammalian expression vector VRC8400. truncations, the RBD, S1, and S2 were synthesized by PCR using a full-length S template. Huh7.5 cells were plated into 96-well white/black Isoplates (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at 10,000 per well the day before infection. serial dilutions of serum or MAbs were mixed with different strains of titrated pseudovirus, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and added to Huh7.5 cells. cDNA sequences were cloned into expression vectors containing constant regions of human or rhesus macaque immunoglobulin heavy () and light ( or) chains. antibody heavy- and light-chain sequences were compared to human or rhesus monkey immunoglobulin germ line sequences using IMGT/V-QUEST. the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) was determined with SpectraMax Plus. unlabeled competitor MAbs were serially diluted and added to the S1-coated plate. OD readings were recorded using biotinylated MAb alone as a binding control. X-ray crystallography for JC57-14 and CDC2-C2 were performed with Octet software, version 9.0. the JC57-14 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) was prepared using the Pierce Fab fragment preparation kit. a gene encoding the CDC2-C2 heavy chain with an HRV3C cleavage site was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pH. after 6 days, the supernatant was passed over a protein A agarose column, and the Fab was eluted by incubating the resin with HRV3C (1% [wt/wt]). Purified RBD was mixed with a 1.2-fold molar excess of CDC2-C2 Fab. the complex was separated from excess Fab fragment on a superdex 200 column. crystals were produced at room temperature using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. the CDC-2\u2013RBD complex was solved using PDB code 4XAK as a search model. a cross-validation test set was used to assess the model refinement process. all structures were built manually in Coot (63) and refined using PHENIX (64) plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) titers were interpolated from the dose-response curves as MAb concentrations resulting in 50% or 80% plaque reduction. PRNT assays were performed in duplicate for each MAb, and PRNT titers from the experiments were averaged to generate the final value used in subsequent calculations. Viral plaques were expanded in vero 81 cells (25-cm2 flasks) without MAb supplementation to generate P0 cultures. TRIzol-extracted viral RNA from cell monolayers, culture lysates (200 l) or P0 supernatants of plaque expansions (200 to 400 l) served as template to generate overlapping cDNA amplicons spanning the entire S gene open reading frame (ORF) work with infectious MERS-CoV strains under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) six- to eight-week-old mice (68, 69) were injected intraperitoneally, while anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane, with a total of 20 mg/kg of MAbs or sterile saline as a control 1 day prior to infection. log rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to calculate P value for survival curves using the Prism software. Statistical variation within each data set is represented as the standard error in each of the figures. all MERS-CoV S genes used for pseudovirus production were cloned into the mammalian expression vector VRC8400 (49, 50) truncations, the RBD, S1, and S2 were synthesized by PCR using a full-length S template. the sequence confirmed for protein production as described previously (20) dilutions of serum or MAbs were mixed with different strains of titrated pseudovirus. incubated wells were replenished with 100 l of fresh medium. cells were lysed 72 h later, and luciferase activity was measured. cDNA sequences were cloned into expression vectors containing constant regions of human or rhesus macaque immunoglobulin heavy () and light ( or) chains. antibody heavy- and light-chain sequences were compared to human or rhesus monkey immunoglobulin germ line sequences using IMGT/V-QUEST. 450 nm (OD450) was determined with SpectraMax Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) the concentration of biotinylated MAb in the linear range of the titration curve was chosen for competition ELISA. unlabeled competitor MAbs were serially diluted and added to the S1-coated plate. X-ray crystallography for JC57-14 and CDC2-C2 was performed with Octet software, version 9.0. the JC57-14 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) was prepared using the Pierce Fab fragment preparation kit. a gene encoding the CDC2-C2 heavy chain with an HRV3C cleavage site was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pH. after 6 days, the supernatant was passed over a protein A agarose column. after 12 h, the column was washed with PBS and the RBD was eluted. CDC2-C2 Fab fragment bound to the RBD was concentrated to 10.5 mg/ml in TBS (2 mM Tris [pH 8.0] and 200 mM NaCl) crystals were produced at room temperature using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 0.1 l of protein with 0.1 l of reservoir solution. the JC57-14 Fab structure gave a final R factor value of 17.9% and Rfree value of 21.3%. the CDC-C2\u2013RBD England1 complex gave a structure model with a final R factor value of 17.9% and Rfree value of 27.0%. PRISM tools, plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) titers were interpolated from the dose-response curves as MAb concentrations resulting in 50% or 80% plaque reduction. a P0 stock of recombinant MERS-CoV EMC/2012 recovered from an infectious clone (65) was serially passaged in vero 81 cell (25-cm2 flasks) cultures supplemented with increasing concentrations of individual MAb TRIzol-extracted viral RNA from cell monolayers, culture lysates (200 l) or P0 supernatants of plaque expansions (200 to 400 l) served as template to generate overlapping cDNA amplicons spanning the entire S gene open reading frame (ORF) PCR products were subject to dideoxy sequencing, and reads were aligned to the native EMC/2012 S gene sequence. inactivation and removal of samples from high containment were performed according to IBC-approved standards. six- to eight-week-old mice (68, 69) were injected intraperitoneally, while anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane, followed by intranasal inoculation with 1 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV diluted in a total volume of 50 l. log rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to calculate P value for survival curves. Statistical variation within each data set is represented as the standard error in each of the figures."}
