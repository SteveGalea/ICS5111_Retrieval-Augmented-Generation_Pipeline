{"summary": "in 2016, there were an estimated 336 million cases of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) globally. LRTIs are the leading infectious cause of death and the sixth-leading cause of death overall worldwide. LRTIs caused an estimated 2.38 million deaths in 2016 alone. etiologies are now identified in 25% of patients, with many having bacterial coinfections with viral respiratory pathogens resulting in decreased mucociliary clearance of bacteria. some respiratory pathogens are frequently detected in healthy patients with colonization, resulting in a questionable causative role in LRTIs. etiology of CAP in children was detected in 86% of 254 children. 62% of children were viral, 53% bacterial, and 30% coinfection. incidence of hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) is approximately 0.5\u20132.0% of hospitalized patients in the united states. up to 10% of acute bronchitis is due to bacteria, including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. up to 90% of cases are due to viral infections such as adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and rhinovirus. antibiotics treat LRTIs with a bacterial etiology. CRP levels between 21 and 99 mg/L are more challenging to interpret and must include further clinical assessment (Table 1). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels and need for antibiotic therapy 20 Withhold in most patients 21\u201399 Further assessment needed to determine 100 Strongly encouraged. PCT is used to assist in the diagnosis of sepsis and has since been used for LRTIs and post-operative infections. it is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid and by the neuroendocrine cells of the lung and the intestine in small quantities. it is a precursor to calcitonin which regulates calcium and phosphate in the blood, but bacterial endokines and cytotoxins stimulate its production early in the disease process. TRAP-LRTI is evaluating outpatient adults with suspected LRTIs. low blood levels of PCT (0.25 ng/mL) using bioM\u00e9rieux\u2019s BRAHMS PCTTM test is being used as an inclusion criterion. patients will be randomized to either azithromycin for 5 days or placebo. 65 predict bacterial infections including mixed viral/bacterial co-infections. this assay has a sensitivity of 93% with a 91\u201394% specificity. the use of this assay was superior to using the biomarkers individually. the gold standard for identification of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens remains culture. testing for antimicrobial susceptibility should also be conducted to ensure adequate therapy is being administered. however, culture and susceptibilities often take multiple days to obtain results. polymerase chain reaction Unyvero A50 System [37] >30 Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria and 10 antibiotic resistance markers or toxins Curetis AG Yes Induced or expectorated sputum, nasal aspirates or washes, NP swabs or aspirates, throat washes or swabs, bronchoscopic specimens 5 h BIOFIRE FilmArray System Pneumonia Panel plus [38] 11 Gram-negative, 4 Gram-positive Approximately one isolated colony from a culture plate is analyzed by the MALDI-TOF MS automated workflow. two MALDI-TOF MS systems have been approved by fda. both systems correctly identified over 85% of the strains tested. this included microorganisms associated with LRTIs. the drawback of the MALDI-TOF MS technology is the potential for overdiagnosis. the yvero LRT cartridge panel has a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 99.5% across all lower respiratory tract panel pathogens. it is the first automated molecular diagnostic test approved by FDA for Legionella pneumoniae. future approval is being sought for expanding the samples to include bronchoalveolar lavage aspirates. some NAATs can provide both viral and bacterial rapid assessments. this ability to determine both viral and bacterial etiologies is advantageous. however, NAATs do have limitations, including the constant need to keep its internal references updated for bacteria and viruses. antibiotic stewardship is based on this premise. over 262 million courses of outpatient antibiotic therapy were prescribed in 2011. most inappropriate use is for acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis. testing."}
