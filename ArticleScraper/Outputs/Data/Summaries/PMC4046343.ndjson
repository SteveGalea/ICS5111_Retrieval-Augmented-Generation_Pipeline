{"summary": "double-stranded RNA signals through 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate Synthetase to RNase L in the Interferon Antiviral Response Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a common pathogen-associated molecular pattern of both RNA and DNA viruses that triggers innate immune responses in the infected host cell. dsRNA:OAS1 (PDB ID code 4IG8) (Donovan and others 2013); porcine RNase L in a complex with natural 2-5A and AMP-PNP ligands. rat AKAP7 central domain (PDB ID code 2VFY) as example of a 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE in the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily. in mice, there are 8 Oas1 genes, mouse (m)Oas1a to mOas1h on mouse chromosome 5 (Mashimo and others 2003; Perelygin and others 2006; Kristiansen and others 2011). only mOAS1a and mOAS1g are believed to be enzymatically active based on results of functional assays. mOas1d and other enzymatically inactive isoforms of mOAS1 may partially protect oocytes from detrimental effects of RNase L during oogenesis and early embryonic development. mOASL1 inhibits the translation of IRF7 mRNA and is a negative regulator of type I IFN synthesis. mOas1a, mOas2 and mOas3 mRNAs are constitutively expressed 2-5A (trimeric and longer species) specifically binds with high affinity to the inactive form of RNase L causing it to dimerize into its enzymatically active state. ATP binding to the kinase domain causes a closed conformation of the kinase domain that is essential for RNA cleavage. ns2 ns2 is a 30 kDa cytoplasmic accessory protein encoded in the genomes of group 2a betacoronaviruses (Bredenbeek and others 1990; Zoltick and others 2003). ns2 was predicated to be a member of a LigT-like family (family II) ns2 was initially predicted to have cyclophosphodiesterase activity. but attempts to demonstrate this activity using 2\u2032,3\u2032 cAMP, 3\u2032,5\u2032 cAMP, and ADP-ribose 1,\u2032\u20322\u2032\u2032 cyclic phosphate as substrates were unsuccessful. MHV primarily infects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the liver inducing acute encephalitis and hepatitis followed by chronic demyelin both sets of ns2 mutants were unable to replicate in the central nervous system. ns2 was an organ-specific virulence factor. previous studies showed MHV induced type I IFN only in macrophages. myeloid cells expressed significantly higher basal levels of IFN-stimulated genes. ns2 did not inhibit induction of IFN or the JAK-STAT pathway of IFN signaling. therefore, it seemed likely that ns2 would inhibit one or more IFN-induced antiviral activities. ns2 mutant completely regained WT ability to replicate in BMM. the most ancient members of the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily are archaeo-bacterial tRNA-ligating LigT proteins with 2\u2032-5\u2032 RNA ligase activity for tRNA precursors. the similarities between ns2 and bacterial LigT suggested to us that perhaps ns2 favors the reverse reaction and degrades 2-5A. rRNA remained intact in ns2 mutant virus-infected BMM. cellular levels of 2-5A oligonucleotides were greatly elevated in ns2 mutant virus-infected BMM. rotavirus minor core protein VP3 has methyltransferease and guanylyltransferase activities involved in mRNA capping. rotavirus VP3 CTD and ns2 were also predicted to be similar to an X-ray crystal structure of the rat A-kinase (AKAP7) complexed with 5\u2032-AMP. mutant VP3-CTD (VP3H718A;H797R) in which the catalytic histidines were mutated was enzymatically inactive. mutant VP3-CTD was also able to prevent accumulation of 2-5A in cells treated with the synthetic dsRNA, poly(rI):poly(rC), an activator of OAS enzymatic activity. chimeric MHV encoding mutant ns2 and VP3-CTD may be a second host IFN antagonist encoded by rotaviruses. ns2 genes predicted to encode a functional 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE. coronaviruses with ns2 genes predicted to encode a functional 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE include human coronaviruses OC43 and HEC4408, which cause respiratory and enteric infections. porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) lack an ns2 homolog. TGEV also lack an ns2 homolog and inhibits RNase L. it is tempting to speculate that these pathogenic human coronaviruses may have alternatives for evading RNase L. a wide range of viruses have evolved mechanisms for blocking this pathway. these viral evasion strategies include, but are not limited to, viral proteins with 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity. the alphacoronavirus encodes the gene 7 protein that suppresses RNase L activity. ral proteins containing dsRNA-binding domains sequester dsRNA from OAS thus preventing 2-5A synthesis and subsequent RNase L activation. some DNA viruses induce the synthesis of alternative 2-5A-like molecules that either inhibit or fail to activate RNase L. three PDEs are candidates for the regulation of 2-5A turnover in cells. only AKAP7 is a member of the 2H phosphoesterase family with conserved sequences and predicted structural homology. AKAPs are a family of 43 proteins that bind the R subunits of PKA. only AKAP7 has a central domain with predicted structural and sequence homology, including the 2 conserved histidine motifs. there are 4 splice variants of AKAP7, 2 short forms of 15 and 18 kDa ( and ), which lack the central domain but contain a membrane targeting region and the PKA-binding motif. AKAP7 resides in the nucleus (Brown and others 2003) and would presumably have access to 2-5A synthesized either there or in the cytoplasm where it could diffuse into the nucleus through the nuclear pores. 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity in the nucleus may be insufficient to reduce 2-5A levels in the cytoplasm where many RNA viruses replicate. future studies will be directed at investigating activation/antagonism of RNase L in other organs systems including the lung and the gastrointestinal tract. specific inhibitors of the viral 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE could function as antiviral agents by restoring the virus-induced accumulation of 2-5A specifically in virus-infected cells with little effect on uninfected cells."}
