{"summary": "Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important health problem in the Roma population in Serbia. recent studies have highlighted the importance of increasing awareness of TB and reducing the associated stigmas to reduce the incidence of TB. study investigated knowledge and beliefs about transmission, symptoms and treatment of TB. research conducted in some marginalized ethnic groups suggests being a member of a minority ethnic group can be an independent risk factor for TB. being poor increases the risk of TB, but being poor increases the risk even further. poor health among the Roma population is closely associated with the fact that they comprise a disproportionate percentage of the poor population. a total of 24 Roma people aged 19-55 years participated in three focus-group discussions. we planned three focus groups with 6-8 participants in each group for ease of facilitation, to give each participant an opportunity to contribute. groups were selected according to living conditions in their communities. participants knew that TB is a pulmonary disease that can be contagious. participants cited laboratory blood analysis as the most appropriate method to establish if someone is contagious. participants knew that patients with cavity were contagious. participants thought that TB could be transmitted in the blood and among family members with the same blood type. some of them even thought that TB could be hereditary. some participants thought that shaking hands was a possible mode of transmission. TB is acquired from bad food, nervousness and worries, participants said. chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, weakness and sweating are symptoms of TB. if untreated, TB could develop into lung cancer. some participants thought that TB is a very serious, lethal disease. others thought that it is an unpleasant and long-lasting disease. some believe that although it is possible to treat TB, it is not totally curable. participants emphasized that they find it hard to protect themselves from TB. they emphasized the importance of appropriate diet and quality food. participants can recall campaigns about tobacco control and AIDS but do not recall seeing anything about TB in the general media. participants would visit a close relative with TB even if they knew the patient was contagious. \"we are all Gypsies, we protect each other. We wouldn't leave without helping any of us,\" participants said. TB could be transmitted in the blood and among family members with same blood type. some participants thought that hand shaking was a possible mode of transmission. others thought that shaking hands was a possible mode of transmission. some participants mentioned rats as possible vectors for TB transmission. if untreated, TB could develop into lung cancer. participants highlight that it is hard to distinguish TB from other pulmonary diseases such as viral pneumonia and asthma. they emphasize haemopthysis as indicative of TB. TB is dangerous but curable owing to medical advances. \"strong\" food such as bacon, pork, sausages, fats and cream cheese is good for preventing TB. some participants thought that patients must pay for prescribed medicines themselves. others thought that medicines prescribed for TB are free of charge. \"we don't have enough time to watch television or to read newspapers,\" participants say. \"we mostly know from the experiences of our neighbors,\" participants say. \"we are all Gypsies, we protect each other. we wouldn't leave without helping any of us,\" participants say. participants identify cough as an important symptom of TB; however, they do not associate cough with transmission of TB. TB is seen as a 'hereditary' disease, so TB is seen as a 'hereditary' disease. smoking is often not recognized as significant risk factor for TB. it is of great importance as smoking is much more prevalent in Roma communities than in general population. smoking should be specially addressed in all health education campaigns. authors declare that they have no competing interests. DV participated in conceptualiseng the paper, data analysis, drafting and revising it critically. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript."}
