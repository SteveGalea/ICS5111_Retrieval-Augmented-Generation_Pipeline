{"summary": "the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outside Middle East Asia in 2015 has necessitated the rapid expansion of laboratories that conduct MERS-CoV molecular testing in Korea. the first phase consisted of in vitro transcribed upstream region of the envelope gene (upE) and the open reading frame (ORF)1a RNAs. 185 Koreans were infected during a four-week period through contact in hospital or in the household environment. this was the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV infections outside Middle East Asia. an urgent external quality assessment was proposed in order to assess the quality of the assays used. upE and ORF1a RNAs were used at a concentration of 1,000 copies/L. all materials were assayed by using a rRT-PCR test for MERS-CoV RNA. a 25-L reaction was prepared with 5 L of RNA, 1 L of each primer, 0.5 L of probe, 1 L of enzyme mix. 1a RNAs were used at a concentration of 1,000 copies/L. the test panel consisted of RNA extracts from three samples (Sample A, B, and C), two from MERS-CoV-positive patients. a 25-L reaction was prepared with 5 L of RNA, 1 L of each primer, 0.5 L of probe, 1 L of enzyme mix, and 12.5 L of 2 RT-PCR buffer. ERS Virus Detection kit (SolGent, Seoul, Korea) and AccuPower MERS-CoV Real-Time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea) only two participants in the first phase and one participant in the second phase of EQA used in-house rRT-PCR methods.

CT values from the ABI 7500 system showed a tendency to be lower than those from BioRad CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Carlsbad, CA, USA) across concentrations, but were not statistically significant. panel results for 47 participants were 100% correct for all three samples tested. difference in mean CT values was similar to that for the first EQA phase. powerChek kit showed the lowest CT values for upE and ORF1a. between powerChek and non-PowerChek kits was significant for upE at concentrations ranging from 1,000 to 10 copies/L. but in the case of ORF1a, it was significant only at 1,000 and 100 copies/L but not at 10 copies/L. the CT values of RNAs had a linear relationship with the logarithmic concentrations for both upE and ORF1a.
