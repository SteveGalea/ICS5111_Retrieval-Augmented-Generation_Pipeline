{"summary": "the incidence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection steadily decreased in the united states (U.S.) and other developed countries following the introduction of the HAV vaccine. the incidence of HAV decreased from six cases per 100,000 in 1999 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 in 2011. there has been a resurgence in the incidence of HAV in the U.S. ED providers in affected areas may encounter and treat a large number of patients. if the disease arises in other regions, it is likely that ED providers would be the first point of contact for many symptomatic patients. if the disease arises in other regions, it is of great importance that cases of the infection be accurately recognized, isolated and treated. public health officials are reporting outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) the cause of a highly contagious illness that can lead to serious morbidity and occasional mortality. a novel tool is created for real-time application in managing patients presenting to the emergency department. as of September 27, 2017, 2,873 cases of HAV infection have been identified. of cases among male patients, 738 (76%) occurred among men having sex with men. 17 cases of HAV in Tel Aviv have been linked to men having sex with men. in the u.s., only 3% of cases of liver failure in adults have been attributed to HAV infection. in countries with a higher disease incidence, some studies report that HAV infection accounts for up to 60% of pediatric liver failure cases. the incubation period for the virus is about 28 days on average, but can range from 15\u201350 days. patients are considered contagious for both two weeks prior to, and up to 1\u20132 weeks after symptom onset. the virus may remain viable on surfaces for months and is resistant to many chemical agents. the primary method of prevention of HAV infection is through vaccination. in the united states, the vaccination is a two-dose series licensed for use in all individuals above the age of 12 months. the safety of the vaccine in pregnancy is indeterminate at this time. a single vaccination is effective and has an efficacy of 94\u2013100% in adults and 97\u2013100% in children. a single vaccination is effective and has an efficacy of 94\u2013100% in adults and 97\u2013100% in children. some ED and prehospital providers who are caring for high-risk populations have been offered vaccination. most immunocompetent patients without major comorbidities can be managed as outpatients with instructions to maintain good hand hygiene. standard admission criteria should be used to assess symptomatic patients and determine whether hospitalization is required. healthcare providers should observe strict standard precautions and hand hygiene with soap and warm water in all cases. affected patients should also be instructed to avoid food preparation for others. patients presenting within two weeks of exposure should be offered PEP. the overall incidence of the disease has been decreasing in developed countries since the development of the HAV vaccine. there have been a number of large outbreaks in several states."}
