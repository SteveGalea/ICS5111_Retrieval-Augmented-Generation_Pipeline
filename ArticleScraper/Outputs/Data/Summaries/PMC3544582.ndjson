{"summary": "we compared several school-based influenza monitoring systems with clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance. we collected data on nation-wide laboratory confirmed cases and daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM) and teacher-led febrile respiratory illness reporting in 6 sentinel schools. Sch-FRI rates were similar across the 6 schools (23 to 34 episodes per 100 children) but there was widespread variation by classrooms. omitting age and school effects was inconsequential but neglecting classroom level effects led to highly significant reductions. in this study, we describe our observations from various school-based systems, and compare these against observations from clinic-based influenza-like illness surveillance. we compare the epidemic curves, and estimate the incidence of febrile illness and infections detected by the different systems and in cross-sectional serological surveys. ILI is defined here as a consult for acute respiratory illness with a temperature of 38\u00b0C and above 25 Jun 2009 to 10 Oct 2009 (weeks 25 to 40)1 NA NA 440 279 Lab-ILI: Proportion of ILIs at GP clinics testing positive for pdmH1N1 Based on testing of ILI samples from a separate sentinel GP network by the National Public Health Laboratory. hemagglutination inhibition titers 40 to pdmH1N1 in post-epidemic samples (Post-SS) minus that in pre-epidemic samples (Pre-SS), adjusted for the sensitivity of detecting confirmed infections using cross-sectional hemagglutination inhibition titers 40 to pdmH1N1 Pre-SS. cross-sectional serological surveys were used to estimate the amount of pdmH1N1 infection in school-aged children. a sentinel network of 23 GPs was set up to monitor pdmH1N1 influenza epidemic activity. GPs submitted individual level data on the age, residency status and body temperature. incidence of notified cases per 100 children was computed based on enrolment data from all 177 primary and 160 secondary schools in Singapore. the Sch-DTM comprised daily counts of students per school identified with fever from a system of twice daily temperature monitoring. this was conducted nation-wide by teaching staff as part of efforts to detect and intervene in outbreaks. we measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to influenza A/California/7/2009 in two sets of residual pediatric sera collected before and after the pandemic. the laboratory methods and associated analysis are identical to those from previous work [17-19] and are described further in the Additional file 1: Appendix. we developed a hierarchical model in which the logit of the per capita probability of having a FRI was governed by school, age and classroom effects. each in turn was assumed to be drawn from a mean zero normal distribution with non-informative prior distributions for the standard deviation. we then fitted more parsimonious models excluding one of these effects. ILI is defined here as a consult for acute respiratory illness with a temperature of 38\u00b0C and above 21 Jun 2009 to 10 Oct 2009 (weeks 25 to 40)1 NA NA 440 279 Lab-ILI: Proportion of ILIs at GP clinics testing positive for pdmH1N1 Based on testing of ILI samples from a separate sentinel GP network by the National Public Health Laboratory. data was collated by the class teacher-in-charge once every 2 weeks 29 Jun 2009 to 3 Oct 2009 (weeks 26 to 39)5 4,320 4,821 964 1,178 Pre-SS and Post-SS: Pre-epidemic and post-epidemic serological surveys based on the proportion with hemagglutination inhibition titers 40 to pdmH1N1 in post-epidemic samples. I was used separately and in combination with Lab-ILI to provide an indication the epidemic\u2019s progress against which the following school-based indicators could be compared. cross-sectional serological surveys were used to estimate the amount of pdmH1N1 infection in school-aged children. pdmH1N1 was made legally notifiable to the Ministry of Health on 27 April 2009. the Sch-LCC dataset included anonymized individual level data on notified laboratory confirmed cases in school children. incidence of notified cases per 100 children was computed based on enrolment data from all 177 primary and 160 secondary schools in Singapore. pre-epidemic and post-epidemic serological survey (Pre-SS and Post-SS) we measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to influenza A/California/7/2009. the laboratory methods and associated analysis are identical to those from previous work [17-19]. confidence intervals (CIs) were generated using binomial and Poisson distributions for proportions and cumulative incidence rates respectively. to assess the variation in FRI incidence from the 6 schools, we quantified the relative importance of three sources of variability \u2013 school, age group, and classroom \u2013 on classroom FRI rates. GP-ILI consultations increased from low levels (1 per GP per day) in week 25 and peaked in epidemiological week 30 (26 July to 1 August 2009), the peak being more pronounced in primary than secondary school-aged children. the composite GP*Lab-ILI indicator accentuates the epidemic curves. 79% of Sch-LCC notifications in primary and secondary school-age children had occurred. about half the total cumulative incidence in GP-ILI (50% and 52%), GP*Lab-ILI (49% and 52%) and Sch-FRI (48% and 53%) all data has been rounded off to 2 significant figures. Sch-FRI is self-reported febrile respiratory illness in the 6 sentinel schools. there were only 0.24 and 0.25 laboratory confirmed cases (Sch-LCC) for every 100 primary and secondary school-age children respectively. the ratio of FRI to estimated infections was 0.60 and 0.57 respectively. the amount of febrile illness detected by Sch-DTM was hence from less than a tenth to about one fifth of that detected by the Sch-FRI system. the variation in rates of school level FRI episodes was small with overlapping confidence intervals. however, there was substantial variation in classroom level FRI rates. primary care ILI and laboratory testing of ILI figures 1A and B presents the epidemic curves for school-aged children. proportion of samples positive for pdmH1N1 (Lab-ILI) increased more rapidly than GP-ILI consultation rates. composite GP*Lab-ILI indicator accentuates the epidemic curves. school-based monitoring results Figure 2 compares the epidemic curves with the GP-ILI data from Figure 1A. Sch-LCC notifications increased and also declined earlier, particularly in the secondary school age group. the daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM, Figures 2C and D) and FRI reporting (Sch-FRI, Figures 2E and F) tracked the GP-ILI data more closely. incidence data for GP-ILI is expressed as the number of ILI consults per GP per week, while that for GP*Lab-ILI is the number of ILI consults per GP per week attributable to pdmH1N1. Sch-LCC is based on notifications of laboratory confirmed cases of pdmH1N1 by all schools, Sch-FRI is self-reported febrile respiratory illness in the 6 sentinel schools. 3.6 and 6.6 FRIs reported per 100 primary and secondary school-age children in that week. the Sch-DTM system detected only 0.63 and 0.52 fevers per 100 children. the rate ratio for Sch-DTM to Sch-FRI was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.150 to 0.209) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.070 to 0.090) respectively. distribution of Sch-FRI episodes by schools and classrooms from weeks 26 to 34. error bars denote 95% confidence intervals from a Poisson distribution. dashed line gives expected distribution based on combined average of 9.2 FRI episodes. dmH1N1 cases (Sch-LCC) detected more of the earlier infections in the epidemic. this is expected since pdmH1N1 notifications were based on the prevailing national testing and reporting regime. this requirement was abolished when the national response transitioned to mitigation phase in early July 2009. a new teacher led febrile respiratory illness reporting system (Sch-FRI) covering six schools across the country obtained incidence rates consistent with those observed in some school-based outbreaks. some studies show symptoms occur in two thirds to three quarters, and febrile illness in about half of serologically detected infections. a wide difference in FRI rates by classrooms, with more than 10-fold difference in rates between the 5th and 95th percentile (5 vs 58 episodes per 100 children) in spite of this, FRI rates aggregated at the level of schools were relatively similar. this apparent disconnect could be explained if we consider influenza incidence at school as an aggregate of semi-independent self-sustaining clusters of transmission at the class-room level. if effective, execution of closures and interventions at classroom level would be far less disruptive than equivalent measures at the level of entire schools or even all schools within geographic areas. if effective, febrile respiratory illness may have to be monitored in real-time and followed-up by confirmatory testing of students identified. this may be logistically challenging since some students would be absent from school at the time of their illness. one study from the us suggests a substantially higher baseline incidence of self-reported febrile respiratory illness in children. some routine collection of baseline FRI incidence may hence be necessary to aid interpretation of data from FRI monitoring systems during epidemics and pandemics.
