{"summary": "translational hopping, stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) can cause deviations from this rule. most viral 1 PRF signals are regulating the production of replication-associated proteins. the heptamer allows post-slippage base-pairing between the non-wobble bases of the tRNAs and the new 1 frame codons of the mRNA. downstream RNA secondary structures force the ribosomes to pause, and place the ribosomal A- and P-sites correctly over the slippery sequence (12). however, the duration of the halt does not necessarily correlate with the level of the 1 PRF observed (12). a stimulating effect is achieved through the formation of a tertiary structure. complementary nucleotides from the 3\u2032 UTR base pair with a single-stranded bulge in the cis-acting stem\u2013loop. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) required a more complex secondary structure instead of a simple stem\u2013loop for optimal 1 PRF in vivo (21,22). three regions from the CfMV polyprotein ORFs were cloned into the NheI and BclI sites in pAC74 (26) the inserted sequences 1602\u20131720 (A region), 1386\u20132137 (B region) and 1551\u20131900 (C region) were amplified by PCR using pAB-21 as a template (18) Plasmids encoded leucine (LEU2) and -lactamase (ampicillin resistance) as selective markers. plasmid pAC1789 and inframe control pAC1790 were used as a positive control. 1 PRF constructs based on the CfMV frameshift signal. CfMV polyprotein encoded by two overlapping ORFs, 2A and 2B via 1 PRF. plasmids named pYES-P27 and pYES-Rep. yeast transformations were done using the LiAc method (27) and transformants were selected on a synthetic minimal defined medium (SC) lacking the corresponding auxotrophic marker(s). Bacteria (E.coli DH5) were grown in LB-medium containing ampicillin. transformants were grown overnight in SC-Leu-Ura media in non-inducing conditions. cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase. expression of the CfMV proteins was confirmed by western blotting using polyclonal antisera against the CfMV ORF 2a and 2b proteins. bacteria were lysed by sonication (3 15 s) and yeasts by vortexing with glass beads (0.5 vol) in +4\u00b0C for 30 min. total protein concentrations were measured by using a Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) plasmids pAC-A, pAC-B and pAC-C were cloned as a final cloning step. plasmids pAC-AB/ABm, pAC-ABm, pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm were also generated. -galactosidase (LacZ) and firefly luciferase (Luc) genes into a dual reporter vector pAC74 (26) translation of the test constructs in the incoming 0-frame yields a -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusion. 1 PRF produces a -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferas two CfMV encoded proteins, P27 (C-terminal end of ORF2A) and replicase (ORF2B), were cloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen) the resulting plasmids were named pYES-P27 and pYES-Rep. the resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing. leu2 trp1-289/trp1-289 ura3-52/ura3-52) (Invitrogen) overnight. protein fusions were purified in denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) pACRF plasmids were used as templates for PCR in order to add T7 promoter upstream of the Rluc gene. transcripts were treated with RQ1-DNase (Promega), purified with Qiagen RNeasy columns. integrity of the transcripts was checked in agarose gels. -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusions are produced without 1 PRF due to the added nucleotide in front of the slippery heptamer. similar vectors have been shown to detect even small changes in the recoding efficiencies resulting from changes in the cis- or trans-acting factors. the longest region was the B-insert. at 752 bp, it started from the 5\u2032-terminus of the 12 kDa viral genome-linked protein (VPg) gene and continued to the end of ORF2A. this region encodes CfMV protein P27 with an unknown function (28). equimolar amounts of fusions produced from the corresponding test and control constructs had equal absolute -galactosidase activities. the -galactosidase activity from pAC-Am inframe control was also comparable to activity obtained from an empty pAC74, where this enzyme has no fusion. this further supported the view that the few observed variations in the -galactosidase activities more likely result from the changes in translatability or stability CfMV frameshift signals generated significant 1 PRF in yeast. 1 PRF level measured from pAC-A was 3-fold higher than from HIV RNA (Figure 2A and B) deletion analysis was carried out to identify the sequence(s) responsible for the enhancement of 1 PRF in vivo. the 5\u2032- or the 3\u2032-sequences flanking the A-region were deleted from pAC-B/Bm or pAC-C/Cm. 1 PRF frequencies were determined in yeast. the longer transframe -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusion proteins were present in both the test and the inframe constructs. antisera recognized the products terminating at the CfMV-encoding regions better than the transframe products. proteins were 183 kDa (A/Am), 206 kDa (B/Bm) and 191 kDa (C/Cm) -Galactosidase\u2013CfMV 0-frame products had calculated sizes of 122 kDa (A), 145 kDa (B) and 130 kDa (Cm) Renilla luciferase has been shown to retain its specific activity irrespective of the C-terminal fusions. we used Rluc\u2013CfMV\u2013luc transcripts to determine the 1 PRF efficiencies in the cell-free system. in vitro translations were programmed with 400 ng of RNA mixture. the mixture contained known proportions of RNAs encoding Renilla luciferase without a fusion and Renilla luciferase fused to Am inframe control sequence and firefly luciferase gene (Rluc-Am-Luc) a faint band having nearly the same mobility as the replicase was detected in cells grown under repressing conditions. however, due to the small size difference, this protein was not regarded as replicase. normalized firefly luciferase levels reached only 54% of expression measured from the empty vector control. the effect was stronger in the presence of inframe control as normalized firefly luciferase levels reached only 54%. those measured from cells expressing replicase were slightly lower than the ratios calculated from cells harbouring pYES-RepAUG plasmids. the effect of P27 expression was more evident with pAC-Am inframe control as P27 expression reduced LUC/LacZ ratio to half. -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusions are produced without 1 PRF due to the added nucleotide in front of the slippery heptamer. similar vectors have been shown to detect even small changes in the recoding efficiencies resulting from altered cis- or trans-acting factors. 1 PRF efficiencies were calculated with enzymatic activities measured from (A) yeast and (B) bacteria. dual reporters containing HIV-1 frameshift region (26) were used as a positive control. deletion plasmids were analysed only in yeast. the error bars indicate the SD calculated from the mean values. inframe controls pAC-Am and pAC-ACm showed 25% lower -galactosidase activities when compared to the equivalent test constructs. -galactosidase seemed to fit well to be used as the first reporter and thus normalization factor in the in vivo experiments. in yeast, the level of upregulation was 2-fold for pAC-B, the 1 PRF frequency being 26.3%, and almost 5-fold for pAC-C. the extent of 1 PRF directed by region A in bacteria was 2.4 0.7%. as in yeast, the longest B region stimulated 1 PRF 2-fold in bacteria. nucleotides 1386\u20131720, or downstream nucleotides 1602\u20132137, was sufficient to increase 1 PRF to the level directed by the region B. protein analysis The expression pattern of the test and control constructs was analysed to understand the basis for the observed upregulation in yeast. western blot analysis of fusion proteins produced via 1 PRF recognized proteins terminating at the CfMV-encoding region. -galactosidase\u2013CfMV\u2013firefly luciferase fusion proteins were purified from yeast cells expressing 1 PRF test and control constructs. m and pAC-Cm were 0.80 and 0.28. the -galactosidase measurements suggested that the overall translatability of the pAC-Cm mRNA was also reduced. but it explained the decrease in firefly luciferase expression only partially. 1 PRF in vitro 1 PRF was assayed in vitro in WGE. similar results were obtained with Rluc-Cm-luc mRNA. in all cases, slightly higher 1 PRF frequencies were obtained than in vivo. in nice correlation with the in vivo results, enhanced 1 PRF was observed. MV regions A/Am, B/Bm and C/Cm as the intergenic regions. results represent an average 1 PRF efficiency calculated from three experiments. error bars show the SD values calculated from the averages. 1, pMAL-VPg 53 kDa; and C2, baculovirus expressed CfMV replicase. measurements showed comparable levels of -galactosidase in all the samples. the effect of P27 or replicase expression was monitored by comparing the reporter activity ratios to those measured from cells harbouring the empty expression plasmids. cells were grown under inducing conditions. results show an average SD from a number of experiments indicated. Western blot analysis with antisera against ORF2A or 2B did not detect any proteins produced from these vectors. the calculated 1 PRF efficiency increased from 14.7 to 22.4%. frameshifting in retroviruses determines the ratio of structural (Gag) to enzymatic (Gag-Pol) proteins. we conclude that the most reliable estimates for 1 PRF can be obtained only by using the full-length viral sequences. the overall competence of CfMV signals to direct 1 PRF was high, when compared to related plant viruses, such as potato leaf roll virus and BYDV. XXXAAAC heptamers dictate 1 PRF to occur via the slippage of two adjacent tRNAs over the heptamer, irrespective of whether the host is an eukaryote or a prokaryote (42). Paused ribosomes can pass the 1 PRF site by 1 frameshifting, resumption of 0-frame translation, or termination (43). this mechanism allows modulation of frameshifting frequency according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. one could speculate that such a regulation mechanism could also be useful to adjust the amounts of replication-associated proteins to match the requirements of different phases in viral replication cycle."}
