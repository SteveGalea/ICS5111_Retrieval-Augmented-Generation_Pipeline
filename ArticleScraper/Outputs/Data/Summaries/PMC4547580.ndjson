{"summary": "public health authorities recognized lessons learned from previous global outbreaks could prove highly useful. multipronged strategies included adequate and timely production of vaccines and antivirals; equitable access to antivirals and vaccines; community mitigation strategies; case-management strategies, including case ascertainment and strong diagnostics; health resource management; health-care system readiness. CDC EARLY RESPONSE TO A NOVEL DISEASE A new disease emerges. Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands sequenced a previously unknown human coronavirus from a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) this first case of MERS-CoV was reported in september 2012; at that time, no cause of the illnesses was identified. a total of 261 confirmed cases, with 93 deaths worldwide, had been reported. at that time, an additional 190 cases, including 41 deaths, were pending WHO's confirmation. most of the confirmed cases resided in KSA (183 cases, 70.1%) and were male. at least 353 CDC staff members had been involved in some aspect of this response. CDC's national center for immunoization and respiratory diseases (NCIRD), division of Viral Diseases, was the primary point of contact for all MERS-CoV-related activities. CDC activated the agency's EOC on June 3, 2013, at a level III. the response activities are conducted Monday\u2013Friday during regular working hours. a level III activation implies that only the Incident Manager and other members of the command staff and/or experts will work extended hours and on -weekends. staff members developed a daily routine that was meant to assist team coordination and communication across all areas of the response. tasks and reporting became organized and systematized under the IAP and the daily staff rhythm. an abbreviated version of the organizational chart was developed and updated as needed. staff members from other national centers were recruited for temporary duty. activating the EOC strengthened the early response to MERS-CoV. activities focused on building laboratory capacity domestically and globally to detect MERS-CoV. CDC deactivated the EOC for the MERS-CoV response on august 13, 2013. the triggers in the IAP for reducing the level of response had been met. despite uncertainty of information known about the trajectory and epidemiology of the disease, new triggers were developed. the task force kept a daily timeline, which notated the response activities for each day. examples of activities and impacts of the centers for disease control and prevention's early response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus outbreak. the first u.s. case of MERS-CoV was reported on may 2, 2014. by that time, a total of 261 WHO-confirmed cases had been reported. at that time, an additional 190 cases, including 41 deaths, were pending WHO's confirmation. CDC began its response to the emergence of MERS-CoV in september 2012. each phase was characterized by its own organizational structure, access to staff support, and scaling of operations up or down. at least 353 CDC staff members had been involved in some aspect of this response. the agency focused on a variety of activities simultaneously. to maintain situational awareness, the agency held daily briefings with staff members from NCIRD's Division of Viral Diseases. other activities included creating essential documents (e.g., internal daily and monthly reports), fashioning key points of communication. CDC implemented a response framework based on the principles of IMS. the framework was divided into three main components: Incident Command, Scientific Response Section, and Emergency Operations. the same person held the position of Incident Manager throughout the early response, allowing for continuity of operations. iology and Surveillance, Laboratory, International Response, Global Migration and Quarantine, Medical Countermeasures, Health-care Systems Response, Health-care and Worker Safety, Modeling, and State Coordination. activities focused on building laboratory capacity domestically and globally to detect MERS-CoV; testing specimens as they arrived from states or global partners. 94 laboratory-confirmed cases and 47 deaths had been reported globally. but the course of the epidemic indicated that spread of the virus did not appear to have pandemic potential. by early august 2013, the scope and scale of the response was reduced. the task force kept a daily timeline, which notated the response activities for each day. CDC staff members gathered additional data through professional contacts, media reports, and international health authorities. the agency focused on a variety of activities simultaneously. CDC activated the agency's EOC on June 3, 2013, at a level III. the response activities are conducted Monday\u2013Friday during regular working hours, with the expectation that only the Incident Manager and other members of the command staff will work extended hours and on -weekends.

CDC deactivated the EOC for the MERS-CoV response on august 13, 2013. the triggers in the IAP for reducing the level of response had been met. the response activities moved back to NCIRD and were scaled back considerably. MERC-CoV response affirmed the importance of advanced preparation for successfully managing the response to a novel pathogen. each new outbreak response should build on the knowledge gained from previous outbreaks, particularly if dealing with a similar pathogen, to save time. CDC shared timely updates with external partners, and partners provided information that helped shape the content of the guidance, published reports, and alerts. the creation of policies such as data-sharing agreements, and the sharing of specimens and reagents among global partners took an extended period of time, sometimes much longer than anticipated. the CDC response was centered primarily in one national center (NCIRD) but the response called on experts from across the agency. this continuity of operations was ensured by maintaining the same Incident Manager throughout all phases of the MERS-CoV early response. CDC is the only federal public health agency mandated to address emerging infectious disease for the whole United States. CDC used its scientific, programmatic, and logistical expertise and resources to address the threat posed by MERS-CoV. a large number of staff members had little actual experience using the IMS. CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention EOC = Emergency Operations Center Rapid surveillance efforts assessed the spread of MERS-CoV globally. the response team had laid the groundwork for the response and established the needed relationships with partners. a substantial amount of communications materials for travelers leaving and entering the united states had been developed. a total of 1,060 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV had been reported worldwide, including at least 394 deaths confirmed by WHO. a total of 1,060 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV had been reported worldwide, including at least 394 deaths confirmed by WHO."}
