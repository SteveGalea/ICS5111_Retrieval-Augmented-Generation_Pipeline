{"summary": "the immune system must respond quickly and dynamically, says daniel sturridge. sturridge: in the face of a foreign invader, the immune system must respond quickly and dynamically. he says infected cells must cope until an effective adaptive immune response can be mobilized. cytosolic RNA-helicases detect viral dsRNA via endosomally localized TLR3. endosomal TLR7/8 responds to ssRNA, TLR9 senses CpG oligodinucleotides. early during viral infection, engagement of PRRs leads to the transcription of type I IFN genes that are regulated by the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) al transcriptional program plays a critical role in controlling infection. it is not completely clear how the host differentiates between ssRNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA of host and pathogen origin. VSV and HCV targets the IFNAR receptor for degradation. DENV blocks Tyk2 phosphorylation, impairs STAT1 phosphorylation, and targets STAT2 for proteosomal degradation. the case for UPR as viral-triggered immune stress signal will be reviewed below. physiologic stresses (increased protein secretion, misfolding proteins) may derail ER function. physiologic stresses (increased protein secretion, misfolding proteins) may derail ER function. IRE1 cleaves 26bp from the XBP1 mRNA, thus removing a premature stop codon. site-specific proteases (S1, S2) cleave it to an active transcription factor. PERK phosphorylates eIF2 resulting in global translational attenuation apart from select open reading frames. IRE1 has a non-specific nuclease activity that degrades ER membrane associated mRNAs in a process known as regulated IRE1 dependent decay. PERK dimerizes, and auto-transphosphorylates to activate its kinase activity. PERK in turn phosphorylates eIF2, resulting in global translational attenuation apart from select open reading frames. XBP1-induced p58ipk binds PERK and inhibits its kinase activity. these pathways induce a gene transcriptional program that enables cells to cope with stress by enhancing protein folding and decreasing protein load in the ER. if ER stress remains unresolved, the UPR initiates apoptosis. viruses induce the UPR in various ways, including greatly increasing protein synthesis. elaboration of misfolded proteins (e.g., hemagglutinin) and direct interaction with BiP. extent of UPR induction varies between viruses and reports describing individual viruses. PERK is evolutionarily related to the interferon induced PKR. PKR responds directly to dsRNA by phosphorylating eIF2 (analogously to PERK) anti-viral molecule RNAse-L generates small RNA species with 5\u2032OH and cyclic 2\u20323\u2032 phosphodiester 3\u2032 ends that can be recognized by RIG-I. physiologic stresses (increased protein secretion, misfolding proteins) and environmental perturbations may derail ER function. PERK phosphorylates eIF2, resulting in global translational attenuation apart from select open reading frames. IRE1 is both a kinase that phosphorylates targets such as JNK and an endonuclease that splices 26bp from the XBP1 mRNA. the only known specific mRNA target for the endonuclease function is the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) IRE1 cleaves 26bp from the XBP1 mRNA, thus removing a premature stop codon. IRE1 endonuclease activity also regulates multiple microRNAs, including miR-17. PERK dimerizes, auto-transphosphorylates to activate its kinase activity. transcription factor ATF4 regulates amino acid transport, protection against oxidative stress, and apoptosis via CHOP. XBP1-induced p58ipk binds PERK and inhibits its kinase activity. the UPR apparently plays a critical role in immune cell homeostasis. it is required for plasma cell development from B-lymphocytes. viruses must utilize host ER to produce greatly increased quantities of viral protein. HCMV US11 induces XBP1 splicing (without downstream EDEM induction) but does not lead to ATF6 cleavage. west Nile virus selectively activates ATF6, but not PERK or IRE1. PERK inhibition appears to be common thread between different viruses. PERK is evolutionarily related to the interferon induced PKR. PKR responds directly to dsRNA by phosphorylating eIF2 (analogously to PERK) in an effort to halt viral protein synthesis. in unstimulated cells, NF-B family members (p50, p52, p62, c-Rel, and c-Rel) are sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with an inhibitory molecule inhibitor of B. dissociation from IB allows NF-B to transit to the nucleus where it can induce cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6. hapsigargin (SERCA pump inhibitor) also stimulate low-level inflammatory cytokine production. ER stress (or ER \u201coverload\u201d) activates NF-B through the generation of reactive oxygen species. inflammatory cytokines can trigger further ER stress through induction of more ROS (oxidative stress) and increasing release of calcium from the ER, interfering with chaperone function. another potential feed-forward loop has been described in the liver. spondyloarthritis, the MHC allele HLA-B27 misfolded, bound BiP excessively, and induced a UPR. macrophages from diseased HLA-B27 transgenic rats showed transcriptomic evidence of both UPR (increased CHOP, BiP, Erp70, etc.) and IFN gene signature (Best5, MX1, Oas1, STAT2, Gbp2, IRF7, CXCL10, etc synergistic IFN- or CXCL10 production was observed on pre-treatment with pharmacologic agents. macrophages from HLA-B27 transgenic rats responded to TLR agonists such as LPS with greatly augmented IFN- production. inflammatory-mediator specificity may depend on cell type. synergy between environmental stimuli and ER stress made teleological sense for spondyloarthritis. spondyloarthritis patients often develop overt or subclinical inflammatory bowel disease, another manifestation linking UPR, microbial triggers, and inflammation. XBP1 knockout mice confirmed a critical role for IRE1-dependent XBP1 transcription factor in synergistic cytokine production. XBP1 apparently plays a role in basal TLR-dependent cytokine production. a nucleosome slides downstream, away from the TATA box. binding of IFN- to the IFNAR receptor then results in new transcription of IRF7. IRF3 is absolutely required for initial LPS-induced IFN- expression. there are no XBP1 binding consensus sequences in the well-characterized ifnb1 promoter/enhancer. direct binding of XBP1 to promoter was not detected by ChIP. a search of the neighboring chromosomal DNA for XBP1 consensus sites revealed a sequence 6 kb downstream of ifnb1 that does bind XBP1, IRF3 and CBP during concomitant ER stress and LPS signaling. ER stress involves calcium dysregulation (thapsigargin treatment, calcium ionophore A23187, oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation) appears to depend upon STING and TBK1. alcohol induced both XBP1 splicing and IRF3 phosphorylation in a STING-dependent manner. the restriction in IRF3-regulated genes may relate to lack of binding sites for UPR-transcription factors. a requirement for both PRR stimulus and UPR-factor binding site might preserve specificity for situations involving both infection and stress. it has become apparent that PRR engagement actually suppresses canonical UPR activity. TLR mediated IRE1 activation and XBP1 splicing appears to proceed through the NADPH oxidase NOX2 pathway. cytosolic stimulation of PKR by dsRNA results in eIF2 phosphorylation, selective ATF4 translation, and GADD34 induction. however, certain transcripts, including those for IL-6, IFN-, and PKR itself continue to be translated in a GADD34 dependent manner. IRE1 endonuclease activity was also required for full induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by Shiga toxin and SV40 virus. the infected cell may utilize stress-signaling pathways without engaging unwanted consequences of the UPR such as apoptosis. DIRECT INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING BY THE UPR Over the past decade, it has become apparent that the UPR directly triggers inflammatory signal transduction pathways. in unstimulated cells, NF-B family members are sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with an inhibitory molecule inhibitor of B (e.g., IB) cologic agents that induce the UPR also stimulate low-level inflammatory cytokine production. cologic agents that induce the UPR also stimulate low-level inflammatory cytokine production. ER stress (or ER \u201coverload\u201d) activates NF-B through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ER calcium release. inflammatory cytokines can trigger further ER stress through induction of more ROS (oxidative stress) and increasing release of calcium from the ER. the molecule most strongly linked to spondyloarthritis misfolded, bound BiP excessively, and induced a UPR. macrophages from diseased HLA-B27 transgenic rats showed transcriptomic evidence of both UPR and IFN gene signature. the association between IFN signature and UPR has been observed in other rheumatologic diseases. it is not clear what portion of synergistic IFN- or CXCL10 production reflected IFNAR signaling by primarily increased IFN-. macrophages from HLA-B27 transgenic rats responded to TLR agonists such as LPS with greatly augmented IFN- production. synergy between environmental stimuli and ER stress made teleological sense for spondyloarthritis. spondyloarthritis patients often develop overt or subclinical inflammatory bowel disease, another manifestation linking UPR, microbial triggers, and inflammation. XBP1 gene knockdown, XBP1 deficient MEFs, and macrophages from conditional XBP1 knockout mice confirmed a critical role for the IRE1-dependent XBP1 transcription factor in synergistic cytokine production. XBP1 apparently plays a role in basal TLR-dependent cytokine production, even in the absence of UPR induction. IRF3 associates with a histone acetyltransferase, CREB binding protein (p300), thus bringing this transcriptional co-activator to the enhancer. a nucleosome slides downstream, away from the TATA box, thus enabling transcription of IFN-. there are no XBP1 binding consensus sequences in the well-characterized ifnb1 promoter/enhancer and direct binding of XBP1 to promoter was not detected by ChIP. a search of the neighboring chromosomal DNA for XBP1 consensus sites revealed a sequence 6 kb downstream of ifnb1 that does bind XBP1, IRF3 and CBP during concomitant ER stress and LPS signaling. ER stress involves calcium dysregulation (thapsigargin treatment, calcium ionophore A23187, oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation) appears to depend upon STING and TBK1. alcohol induced both XBP1 splicing and IRF3 phosphorylation in a STING-dependent manner. the restriction in IRF3-regulated genes may relate to lack of binding sites for UPR-transcription factors. a requirement for both PRR stimulus and UPR-factor binding site might preserve specificity for situations involving both infection and stress. TLR mediated IRE1 activation and XBP1 splicing appears to proceed through the NADPH oxidase NOX2 pathway. cytosolic stimulation of PKR by dsRNA results in eIF2 phosphorylation, selective ATF4 translation, and GADD34 induction. however, certain transcripts, including those for IL-6, IFN-, and PKR itself continue to be translated in a GADD34 dependent manner. CTA does not activate the ATF6 or PERK pathways. IRE1 endonuclease activity was also required for full induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by Shiga toxin and SV40 virus. however, such a response would not necessarily be exclusive of a role for the UPR. HCV antagonizes IFN- production via CHOP and subsequent autophagy activation. the invoked UPR in turn has the potential to augment anti-viral responses. multiple mechanisms intertwining the UPR and inflammatory/IFN responses have been described. the effect of infection-triggered UPR on non-infected cells adds another interesting dimension for future potential investigations. XBP1 has been reported to be critical for control of VSV by dendritic cells."}
