{"summary": "surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a pulmonary collectin involved in regulation of inflammation. it is expressed by Clara cells and alveolar type II cells in the lung. levels of SP-D have been examined for their potential use as a biomarker in various diseases including dermatitis [2], [3], acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]\u2013[13], periodontitis [14], interstitial pulmonary fibrosis [10], [12], [15]\u2013[23], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [15], [24]\u2013[36], [38], [39], coronary disease [ SP-D is thought to be a marker of pulmonary leak into the vasculature. but protein levels in lung do not always correlate with protein levels in blood. there is a very substantial discrepancy between the reported values of the healthy control populations between studies. all experiments had 6 samples per group except for the experiments depicted in Figures 2 and 4. Figure 2. Use of various diluents for the recombinant SP-D standard. a 1 g/mL recombinant SP-D stock was diluted 199 in various matrices. mouse antihuman SP-D capture antibody, biotinylated mouse antihuman SP-D detection antibody, streptavidin conjugated to horse radish peroxidase, and recombinant human SP-D standard were purchased as a kit from R&D Systems. a concentrated stock was made in PBS with 1% BSA from separately purchased recombinant human SP-D expressed in NSO cells. samples were either directly aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C or given an additional round of centrifugation at 3000xg for 10 minutes to separate platelets from serum or plasma. all experiments had 6 samples per group except for the experiments depicted in figures 2 and 4. a concentrated stock was made in PBS with 1% BSA from separately purchased recombinant human SP-D expressed in NSO cells. a monoclonal mouse antigoat conjugated to horse radish peroxidase was used instead with a monoclonal mouse antigoat conjugated to horse radish peroxidase. a substantial range of means/medians was observed in the healthy control population. the spectrum of values in all populations ranged from 55.9 pg/mL [22] to 3.9653 g/mL [89], representing a more than 70,000 fold difference. the range of healthy control [SP-D] greatly varied from study to study. values shown are either median and interquartile range (IQR), median and 95% confidence interval (95%), or mean and standard deviation (SD). the calculated fold increase from the average healthy [SP-D] and average [SP-D] during IPF [12], [16]\u2013[19], [21], CF [15], [38], [39], cigarette smoking [28], [31], [72]\u2013[75], or a decrease in the amount of rhSP-D detected was observed. at higher concentrations of protein (i.e. 5% BSA, 50% FBS, and 100% FBS), the amount measured in samples containing 10 ng/mL rhSP-D was the most variable of any samples measured in this assay. rhSP-D was assayed in serially diluted CaCl2 or EDTA. the detection of rhSP-D was only slightly effected by the changes in calcium concentration in the sample. the addition of EDTA to the serum samples had a dramatic effect. the addition of 5 mM calcium to the dilution and wash buffer resulted in a small but significant increase in SP-D concentration relative to detection in the absence of calcium. it is important to note that with the kit reagents, since the relative increase in detection of recombinant SP-D in plasma in the presence of calcium is very similar. D standard were detected using either kit reagents or non-kit reagents. all values were significantly different (p0.05) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. influence of sample dilution on extrapolated SP-D level. we assayed serum and heparin plasma without platelets immediately after processing or after storage at 4\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, or 80\u00b0C. there were no significant differences between conditions. a sample stored at 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C for two weeks was not different from the same samples at one week. the study with the smallest range for any population reported a 95% confidence interval of 95.7\u2013109.0 [54]. the study containing the population with the largest range reported a standard deviation of 327% of the mean value [42]. the range of healthy control [SP-D] greatly varied from study to study. the largest difference in the measured levels of SP-D is due to the ELISA configuration employed. however, there are still significant differences between the averages of healthy individuals from studies using the same configurations. we examined the fold change from healthy populations for the four diseases/conditions for which a substantial number of publications were available. serum and heparin plasma gave similar measurements of SP-D. citrate plasma gave the most inconsistent results. rhSP-D concentrations were measured in samples collected into four different vacutainers during a single blood draw. rhSP-D was only slightly effected by changes in calcium concentration in the sample. addition of EDTA to serum samples had a dramatic effect that was inconsistent amongst the patient samples. ELISAs were performed with antibodies diluted in buffer with or without calcium. the inclusion of calcium increased the recognition of native SP-D by the polyclonal antibody. but it had no effect on the detection of recombinant SP-D by this antibody. future work will explore whether this effect is due to an increase in antibody recognition of antigen. ten fold diluted EDTA plasma, however, produced a significantly higher extrapolated SP-D value when compared to the same sample undiluted. the extrapolated value in the tenfold diluted sample was multiplied by 10 in order to compare to the original, undiluted sample. a study provides experimental evidence that variations in the anticoagulant used and ELISA configuration can have dramatic effects on the measured SP-D level. differences in ethnic background and geographical location from which subjects were recruited may contribute to the variations seen when the same ELISA configuration was employed. however, we would expect the range of samples between healthy populations of different studies to be similar. a single, captured monomer of SP-D would be able to bind a single anti-neck antibody. a single, captured dodecamer would be able to bind 12 anti-neck antibodies. the degree of multimerization has been shown to vary in the lungs during different disease states. the antibody from the kit recognizes an epitope that is not post-translationally modified or altered in human serum/plasma SP-D. this would result in the observed relative decrease in binding of the native SP-D from the blood compared to the recombinant SP-D."}
