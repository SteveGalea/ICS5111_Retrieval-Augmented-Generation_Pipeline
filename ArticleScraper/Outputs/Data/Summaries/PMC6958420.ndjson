{"summary": "Johne\u2019s disease (paratuberculosis), a chronic enteritis caused by MAP, can result in profuse diarrhea, malabsorption of nutrients, and severe weight loss in end-stage disease. efforts to mitigate disease transmission have focused on preventing infection in the neonate with clean maternity pens and feeding pasteurized colostrum and waste milk. the period of time during which passively transferred immunity wanes, but endogenous immunity remains immature, is a critical window for pathogen opportunism. the period of time during which passively transferred immunity wanes, but endogenous immunity remains immature, is a critical window for pathogen opportunism. colostrum replacer contained 150 g bovine globulin protein from colostral whey. colostrum replacer contained 150 g bovine globulin protein concentrated from colostral whey. all calves received a first feeding of colostrum replacer within 4 h of birth. CR-ADE calves were orally administered 25,000, 5000, and 500 IU of the respective compounds daily in their dietary milk. the CR-ADE calves received an injection or oral solution containing vitamins A, D3 and E. cfu per dose of mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), strain 167 (clinical isolate, NADC, Ames, IA, USA) in PWM. the study was designed to evaluate effects of colostrum and vitamins on early MAP infection so there were no uninfected calves. DNA from fecal samples was extracted by using the Ambion\u00ae Mag MaxTM total nucleic acid isolation kit. a sterile glass slide was used to scrape the mucosal surface. cross-sections of tissues were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut at 4\u20136 m. granulomas/AF bacteria were not detected; 1, rare granulomas/AF bacteria were present in a section; 2, a granuloma with AF bacteria was typically present in each field. DNA was extracted from tissues by using modified procedures of the UltraClean\u00ae tissue & cells DNA isolation kit. samples were homogenized by using a gentleMacsTM Octo Dissociator with M tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 2.0 mL buffer (Qiagen) DNA was extracted by using the PowerMagTM Microbiome RNA/DNA Isolation Kit\u00ae (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.) the moira contig constructor was set to report the best qscore. filtering by moira was parameterized to treat ambiguous bases as sequencing errors. amplicon contigs were analyzed using the Schloss MiSeq SOP [20] except where differences were noted. OTUs were assigned to consensus taxonomy and were indexed according to sample. microbial community data analysis was performed using R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) plots with standard error ellipses were created using the package \u2018ggplot2\u2032. p-Values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. phyloseq microbiota data were converted to DESeq2 datasets. all calves received a first feeding of colostrum replacer or pasteurized whole milk (PWM) within 4 h of birth. calves in the remaining five treatment groups received 375 g of fractionated colostrum replacer reconstituted in 1.9 L water. colostrum replacer contained 150 g bovine globulin protein concentrated from colostral whey. experimental design (a), with five calves per treatment group. animals were cared for according to guidelines of the federal animal welfare act of 1966. animals were housed indoors in individual pens elevated from concrete floor. decontaminated samples were dispensed onto Herrold\u2019s Egg Yolk medium (HEYM) and incubated at 39 \u00b0C for 12 weeks. samples were incubated overnight and then inoculated onto four slants of HEYM. colony counts of viable MAP were recorded and averaged. tissue culture, DNA Extraction, and histopathology Calves were euthanized after a 12 h fast on day 14 1. ileum, ileo-cecal valve, regions of jejunum, duodenum, cecum, spiral colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and lymph nodes of each region, as well as liver and spleen. a sterile glass slide was used to scrape the mucosal surface. 100 mg of tissue was placed into a 2 mL screw cap vial. samples were vortexed for 10 min, incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. PCR was performed for the detection of the IS900 target gene in feces. DNA was extracted by using the PowerMagTM Microbiome RNA/DNA Isolation Kit\u00ae. extracted samples were quantified using a nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer. DNA concentration in each sample was brought to 500 ng/L in water. the amplicon contigs were analyzed using the Schloss MiSeq SOP [20] except where differences were noted. the amplicons were screened to remove all sequences containing ambiguous bases and to contain sequences 364\u2013500 bp long. all microbial community data analysis was performed using R version 3.6.1. the package \u2018phyloseq\u2019, (version 1.28.0) [25] was used to import and analyze the OTU and taxonomy data. alpha and beta diversity, relative and differential abundance of microbial populations was assessed within each tissue and sample. Phyla that contributed more than 2% of the relative abundance of each sample was included in the analysis using the \u2018tax_glom\u2019 function. phyloseq microbiota data were converted to DESeq2 datasets. MAP was recovered from 42 of the 660 tissues collected at necropsy for the 30 calves. nineteen of the 30 calves had positive tissues and these calves were distributed amongst all treatment groups. the degree of colonization by location did not differ in these three main culture-positive tissues, averaging 2.27 0.89, 2.56 0.87, and 2.41 0.82 cfu/g. the low level of colonization corresponded with a lack of detectable lesions within the selected tissues, regardless of treatment group. the number of PCR-positive tissues was once again higher for CR-E and CR-ADE calves. regional effects in communities demonstrated significant differences (p 0.001) between ileum, and the cecum, ileum, and spiral colon. the stratification between lumen contents and mucosa was more pronounced for the ileum. differences were observed only for CD calves in cecum and spiral colon tissues. no differences were noted due to vitamin supplementation. ellipses were created using \u2018ggplot2\u2032. different superscripts are statistically different. different superscripts are statistically different,. CD-Lumen versus CD-Mucosa. phyla that contributed more than 2% of the relative abundance of each sample were included in the analysis. phyloseq and 'tax_glom' functions plotted against sample, for each tissue. phylum proteobacteria, p 0.0001 and Phylum Bacteroidetes, p 0.02. greater relative abundance was ascribed to populations of Escherichia/Shigella, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae. colostrum deprivation resulted in higher levels of colonization with bacteria that dominate within the ileum. phyloseq microbiota data were converted to DESeq2 datasets. the raw OTU counts were agglomerated at the genus level. color of dots represents the main phyla analyzed. fecal shedding of MAP at day 7 was detected in 18 of 28 calves by culture. fecal shedding of MAP at day 7 was detected in 18 of 28 calves. MAP was recovered from 42 of the 660 tissues collected at necropsy. nineteen of the 30 calves had positive tissues and these calves were distributed amongst all treatment groups. the average number of tissues positive for viable MAP was higher for calves in the CR-A, CR-E, and CR-ADE groups. treatment DJ IL ICV CD 0 0 0 CR 1 1 2 CR-A 2 1 2 CF-D 1 1 0 CR-E 1 2 2 CR-ADE 2 3 1 1 Treatments included CD: Colostrum-deprived; CR: Colostrum-replete; CR-A: Supplemented with vitamin A; CR-ADE: Supplemented with vitamin E; n = 5 per treatment group per tissue. DNA was extracted from the lumen and mucosa of three intestinal tissues. all microbial community data analysis was performed on the Illumina MiSeq Sequencer. different superscripts are statistically different, *,** p 0.02. Ileum, CR-Lumen versus CR-Mucosa, *,** p 0.03. differences were more apparent for CR calves (p 0.0002) than CD calves (p 0.04) overall. results for spiral colon shown as an example. TU based on consensus taxonomy generated in mothur and phylum relative abundance was compared among lumen and mucosal samples. phyla analyses into either lumen or mucosal locations resulted in overall differences (p 0.0001). a across all three tissues were apparent for Phylum Proteobacteria, p 0.0001 and Phylum Bacteroidetes, p 0.02. Feeding colostrum resulted in differences in phyla in the mucosa and lumen of all three tissues. overall, CD calves had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria, depending upon tissue. a 5% relative abundance of Fusobacterium in the cecum and 14% relative abundance of Campylobacter in the ileum were ed from CR calves. microbial colonization levels were low, resulting in a large number of rare OTUs. differential abundance was analyzed between the ileal mucosa for CR and CD calves. color of dots represents the main phyla analyzed and position of dots represents increase or decrease in representation of specific genera due to colostrum feeding. additional OTUs present within the ileum, regardless of colostrum feeding, included genera such as Campylobacter, Phyllobacteriaceae, and Burkholderia. a study of 18 dairy farms tested positive for MAP in environmental fecal samples showed that animal age was a factor in fecal transmission. despite the appearance of MAP in the feces of exposed calves, the level of shedding herein can be explained by a high level of pass-through shedding. colonization of target tissues was successful, but the number of viable MAP recovered per tissue was quite low. supplementation with vitamins A, D3 and E did not overtly affect MAP colonization in the gut of calves. however, there was a trend towards higher numbers of infected tissues in calves supplemented with vitamin E (CR-E and CR-ADE) this is an interesting observation as we were expecting that vitamins would improve tissue integrity. colostrum contains cytokines that can function as immunomodulators, thus providing enhanced protection against infection. colostrum also contains TGF-, which is noted for Th1 suppression in the neonatal calf. this may be compounded by the dominant Th2 immune status of the dam. a pattern of increased colonization was observed in CR calves compared to CD calves in the spiral colon. this aligns with increased Bifidobacterium noted for CR calves compared to CD calves in the spiral colon. derakhshani et al. [49] were the first to characterize changes in the microbiome of the ileal mucosa and feces of MAP-infected calves. they observed a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria, including Sphingomonoadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, and Firmicutes, including Lactobacillus and Epulopiscium. the ileal mucosa shared commonality with the mucosa of the large intestine. this suggests that the mucosal bacteria of the ileum inoculate the large intestine downstream. this suggests that the mucosal bacteria of the ileum inoculate the large intestine downstream. lum Actinobacteria houses both Mycobacteria and the beneficial Bifidobacteria. low abundance of the parent phylum suggests these bacteria are less involved in community structure in pre-weaned calves. presence of Firmicutes is stable in the intestine and evidence of direct vertical transmission through generations suggests host-specific adaptation of organisms belonging to this phylum. colostrum deprivation could have a significant impact on the ability of calves to establish a balance within the total microbial population. this would lead to dysbiosis and increased morbidity, a finding relevant to all species of animals."}
