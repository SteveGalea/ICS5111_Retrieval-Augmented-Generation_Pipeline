{"summary": "PCR has shown excellent clinical utility over the more traditional laboratory methods of virus culture and direct antigen tests for the sensitive detection of respiratory viruses. a total of 215 archived respiratory specimens from pediatric patients were used, including 196 (91.2%) nasopharyngeal aspirates. the samples were originally submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2006 and may 2011. multiple single-use aliquots of each specimen were immediately stored frozen at 70\u00b0C following processing for clinical testing. patients from whom specimens had been collected ranged in age from 19 days to 22.2 years with a median age of 2.24 years. the different serotypes were grown in lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549; ATCC CCL-185), diluted to achieve targeted real-time PCR CT values between 25.00 and 27.99 and between 35.00 and 37.99. this work was deemed not to be human subject research and was declared to be exempt by the institutional review board. 1.0 106 cells/ml of an uninfected human lung carcinoma cell line. positive controls were prepared as a mixture of clinical material from previously positive patients. no-template controls were included in each reaction plate. nucleotide sequences of primers and probes used for real-time TaqMan PCRa assay forward primer (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) TaqMan probe (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) Gene target Adv GCC ACG GTG GGG TTT CTA AAC TT GCC CCA GTG GTC TTA CAT GCA CAT C (FAM)-TGC ACC AGA CCC GGG CTC AGG TAC TCC GA-(TAMRA) Matr G AGA CC-(BHQ-1) HA IV A 2009 H1N1 TAG AGC CGG GAG ACA AAA CGT GGA CTG GTG TAT CTG AA (FAM)-TCT AGT GGT ACC GAG ATA TGC ATT CGC-(TAMRA) HA IV B TCC TCA ACT CAC TCT TCG AGC G CGG TGC TCT TCT TGA CCA AAT TGG (VIC) GA ATG YGG C-(TAMRA) 5\u2032 NCR Bocavirus TGC AGA CAA CGC YTA GTT T CTG TCC CCA AGA TAC A (FAM)-CCA GGA TTG GGT GGA ACC TGC AAA-(TAMRA) NS-1 AGA GGC TCA TCA TCA RCC ACC TAT CGT CT-(TAMRA) NP-1 B. pertussis CCC ATA A a self-contained, disposable, plastic pouch is used to perform the respiratory panel. the pouch houses all of the chemicals and enzymes needed to isolate, amplify, and detect nucleic acids from a specimen. the filmArray software uses endpoint DNA melting-curve analysis to automatically generate a result for each target. each sample run contains internal process controls for RNA extraction, DNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), PCR 1, dilution of first-stage multiplex PCR, and PCR 2. coronavirus types HKU1, NL63, and OC43 and parainfluenza virus type 4 were not considered discordant between the two methods. kappa statistic and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the VassarStats website for statistical computation. a total of 215 archived respiratory specimens from pediatric patients were used. the individual threshold cycle (CT) values for positive analytes spanned the reportable range of the real-time PCR assays. 20 characterized adenovirus serotypes representing groups A (type 12), B (types 3, 7, 11, 14, 21, and 35), C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6), D (types 10, 19, 20, 29, 32, and 37), E (type 4), and F (type 40 and 41) were obtained from either the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC universal master mixes for either RNA (Ambion AgPath-ID one-Step RT-PCR master mix; Applied Biosystems) or DNA (TaqMan universal master mix; Applied Biosystems); universal amplification conditions consisting of 1 cycle for 10 min at 45\u00b0C and 1 cycle for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. negative controls consisted of 1.0 106 cells/ml of an uninfected human lung carcinoma cell line. Specimens that reached the threshold before 38 cycles were considered positive without further testing. those that reached the threshold at or after 38 cycles were considered positive without further testing. those that reached the threshold before 45 cycles were considered positive only if, upon duplicate repeat testing of separate aliquots of stored original specimen, at least one of the two repeat tests also reached the threshold before 45 cycles.
