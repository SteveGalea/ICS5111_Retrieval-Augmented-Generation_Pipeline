{"summary": "'hygienic behaviour' first described for honey bees is now a classical example of a social defence, whereby workers identify and remove infected larvae from the healthy brood. other defences enabled by sociality include the construction of nests from antimicrobial materials. honey bees have diverse mechanisms to combat infection by pathogens. many insects are protected by a layer of antimicrobial secretions on their exterior, and by a gut environment that is hostile to pathogens. if pathogens defeat the morphological defences of insects, they are often met by efficient cellular and humoral immune defences. many immune-gene families in honey bees appear to be reduced in number, when compared to Drosophila and Anopheles. these reductions hold for each stage of immunity, from recognition and signalling to immune effectors. we couple gene-family data with data on specific orthologues. the presence of the JAK/STAT cytokine receptor domeless suggests that JAK/STAT remains functional in honey bees. names are given for the Drosophila pathway components, along with vertebrate orthologues (in parentheses) two plausible Spaetzle orthologues are evident in the honey bee genome. functional tests will be needed to determine which of the two paralogues is the key transcription factor for this pathway. bee effectors are responsive to pathogens and/or mechanical wounding of bees. some of the effectors are responsive to pathogens and/or mechanical wounding of bees. the imd signalling pathway is highly conserved in the honey bee. it is highly conserved in the honey bee, with plausible orthologues for all components. this strongly suggests that Imd signalling is similar in flies and bees. the tyrosine phosphatase Ptp61F (XP392429) and the WD40- and bromo-domain-containing protein BRWD3 (XP395263) are also present in the honey bee. the key ligand (Upd) for the JAK/STAT pathway was not found in the honey bee genome. bees have the lowest gene counts for 12 of the 17 families. Drosophila and Anopheles show the highest paralogue counts for this triad seven and eight times, respectively, versus once in bees. there are only four PGRPs in the honey bee genome, compared to 13 and 7 in Drosophila and anopheles respectively. the single membrane-bound PGRP in bees (PGRP-LC, GB17188) is similar to fly and mosquito PGRP-LC. PGRP-LC and PGRP-S2 are both up-regulated in honey bees after disease challenge. peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family members for honey bees (underlined), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) and Anopheles gambiae (Ag) circles indicate apparent three-way orthologues for these three species. relationship between members of the Class B scavenger receptors. many genes with EGF motifs are present in the bee genome. many genes with EGF motifs are present in the bee genome. none of these cellular immunity components appear to be more diverse in bees than in fly species. domain SPs identified to date (n = 14) from expression data in Manduca sexta. serine protease inhibitors from the serpin superfamily regulate protease cascades in mammals and in arthropods. serpins inhibit activated proteases to maintain homeostasis and prevent unregulated activation of immune responses. ancestral Toll appears to have diverged into two different groups in flies. toll-7/2 is represented only by a single honey bee homologue. a protein named Apis mellifera toll7 seems more likely to be an orthologue of Toll-10. the total of six honey bee antimicrobial peptides contrast with the 20 and nine found in Drosophila and Anopheles respectively. two of these (abaecin, and apidaecin) are in the class of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides. plotypes encode a range of 4\u201311 secreted peptides each. the 35 peptides expressed by these five haplotypes reflect 23 different amino acid variants. there is no evidence for close paralogues for any of the honey bee antimicrobial peptides. fewer thiolester-containing proteins (TEPs) in the bee genome (four) than expected based on flies. fewer thiolester-containing proteins (TEPs) in the bee genome (four) than expected based on flies. cytokine receptor domeless and all other members of this pathway suggest that JAK/STAT remains functional in honey bees. names are given for the Drosophila pathway components, along with vertebrate orthologues (in parentheses) functional tests will be needed to determine which of the two dorsal paralogues is the key transcription factor for this pathway. the intracellular components Tollip, Pellino, Cactin and TNF receptor associated factor-2 are believed to aid the main players of this pathway. transcript abundances in 2nd-instar larvae challenged orally with infective dose of P. larvae or unchallenged controls. cluster A = genes strongly up-regulated by adult injection or wounding. cluster B = genes up-regulated in infected larvae, Cluster C = genes down-regulated or minimally changed in challenged bees. the imd signalling pathway is highly conserved in the honey bee. orthologues for each component of the JNK signalling pathway were also identified in the honey bee genome. the key ligand (Upd) for the JAK/STAT pathway was not found in the honey bee genome. the presence of the gp130 cytokine receptor homologue Domeless indicates that this mechanism may be common across insects and is intact in honey bees. Drosophila and Anopheles were lowest for only one family each (defensins and dorsal, respectively) in contrast, Drosophila and Anopheles show the highest paralogue counts for this triad seven and eight times, respectively, versus once in bees (for the Toll-pathway candidate cactus, with three copies) there are only four PGRPs in the honey bee genome, compared to 13 and seven in flies and mosquitoes. the single membrane-bound PGRP in bees is similar to fly and mosquito PGRP-LC. PGRP-LC and PGRP-S2 are both up-regulated in honey bees after disease challenge. PGRP family members for honey bees (underlined), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), and Anopheles gambiae (Ag) circles indicate apparent apparent three-way orthologues for these three species. relationships between members of the Class B scavenger receptors, including the above insect members and mouse and human CD36 proteins. many genes with EGF motifs are present in the bee genome (e.g. GB14654, Supplementary Material Table S1), as in flies. none of these cellular immunity components appear to be more diverse in bees than in fly species. serpins inhibit activated proteases to maintain homeostasis and prevent unregulated activation of immune responses. number of serpin genes in the honey bee is much lower than in the honey bee. ancestral Toll 7/2 is represented only by a single honey bee homologue. a protein named Apis mellifera toll7 seems more likely to be an orthologue of Toll-10. orthologues of Toll-6, -7 and -8 are also present in the genomes of other insects. the total of six honey bee antimicrobial peptides contrast with the 20 and nine found in Drosophila and anopheles respectively. two of these (abaecin, and apidaecin) are in the class of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides, two are conventional defensins and two (apisimin and hymenoptaecin) are distinct from all other recognized antimicrobial peptides. the 35 peptides expressed by these five haplotypes reflect 23 different amino acid variants. all of the honey bee antimicrobial peptides were first characterized by protein sequencing. there is no evidence for close paralogues for any of the honey bee antimicrobial peptides. the bee genome encodes 15 TEPs, most of them originating from species-specific expansion. they are induced after septic injury and promote phagocytosis in mosquitoes. they also play a central role in vertebrate innate immunity as the complement factors. our analyses indicate that the basic set of molecules defining the insect host-defence system is present in honey bees. single orthologues can be assigned for many pathway members, while others show several potential bee genes for which further work is needed to confirm roles. however, we have not found examples of such gene expansions in honey bees. bees face a less diverse set of successful parasites and pathogens. societal defences by bees lessen pathogen pressures. societal defences by bees lessen pathogen pressures. bees also raise their young in individual cells using substances with antimicrobial properties. 'Social' barriers might also reduce exposure to minor, opportunistic, pathogens or saprophytes. we present the first plausible models for immune pathways in a social insect, the honey bee. we show nearly complete conservation of candidate genes for these pathways yet show that bees have consistently undercut numbers of genes that embellish these pathways in other insects. honey bee contigs were too short to be included in the assembly. searches were repeated in the hope of identifying paralogues missed by interspecific comparisons. all protein matches were ported to Apis mellifera assembly 3.0 using the alignment program BLAT. the PGRP tree is based on the conserved domain region only. other alignments were edited manually to reduce or remove ambiguous regions. scavenger receptor AmelSCRB8 was not included because its relatively short predicted length precluded an unambiguous alignment. bees using a standard TRIzol procedure while RNA was extracted from individual larvae using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) RNAs were pooled by sample duration for the eight larvae challenged with the bacterial pathogen P. larvae. the eight controls prior to cDNA synthesis gave six RNA pools. the honey bee genome was searched by BlastP queries against the consensus protein list (GLEAN3) using BlastP and algorithms appropriate to gene size and structure. honey bee orthologues were also identified by searching honey bee genome assemblies 2.0 and 3.0 directly using TBLASTN. all protein matches were ported to Apis mellifera assembly 3.0 using the alignment program BLAT (Jim Kent, University California, Santa Cruz) all protein matches were aligned and checked for gene-prediction errors (in the case of genes from the official protein list) the PGRP tree is based on the conserved domain region only. other alignments were edited manually to reduce or remove ambiguous regions. honey bee scavenger receptor AmelSCRB8 was not included. RNAs were pooled by sample duration for the eight larvae challenged with the bacterial pathogen P. larvae. the eight controls prior to cDNA synthesis gave six RNA pools. DNA was removed from all extracts, then first-strand cDNA was synthesized. immuno-gene transcripts were normalized relative to expression levels for the gene encoding ribosomal protein S5. for display purposes, transcript abundance values (CTcontrol\u2013CTtarget) for each gene were median-normalized across each panel of genes and clustered by average linkage clustering."}
