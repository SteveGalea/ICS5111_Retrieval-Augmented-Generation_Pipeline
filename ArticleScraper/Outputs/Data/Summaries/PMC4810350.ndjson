{"summary": "a MERS-CoV outbreak was reported in 2015, with high mortality. there were 37 [19.9%] deaths in total 186 MERS-CoV patients. a 68-year-old man was transferred to our center presenting with 5 days of coughing, shortness of breath, and general weakness. the patient complained of myalgia, dry cough, dyspnea, and nausea-vomiting. he was transferred to a tertiary hospital after 4 days of ineffective treatment. he was treated with 180 g of pegylated interferon-alpha. the patient underwent a tracheostomy on HOD 23 and was weaned from the mechanical ventilator on HOD 39. blood and urine cultures were negative, and the sputum cultures identified multiple drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR AB), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes. g Cr and 1,075.6 mg/g Cr performed the kidney biopsy on HOD 55. Fig. 1 shows progression of renal function, albumin, and urinary protein excretion. IDMS traceable serum creatinine and IDMS-MDRD. inflammatory cells in tubules and the interstitium (A, B, C: magnification 200, D: magnification 40). inflammatory cells in tubules and the interstitium (A, B, C: magnification 200, D: magnification 40). inflammatory cells in tubules with vacuolar degenerative alterations (magnification 400). the sections were washed and incubated for an additional 5 minutes with 4 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for counterstaining. no evidence of MERS-CoV co-stained with DPP 4 was observed. the IDMS traceable SCr level was 0.9 mg/dL on HOD 125. a urine dipstick test was negative for albumin and 2+ blood at that time. a urine dipstick test was negative for albumin and 2+ blood at that time. in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy performed by RNAscope kit. FFPE sections were cut into 4-m thick sections. Xylene and ethanol were used for deparaffinization. d anti-goat, Alex Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse and human IgG (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. sections were washed and incubated for an additional 5 minutes with 4 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) for counterstaining. no evidence of MERS-CoV co-stained with DPP 4 was observed with confocal microscopy. a urine dipstick test was negative for albumin and 2+ blood at that time. a urine dipstick test was negative for albumin and 2+ blood at that time. a urine dipstick test was negative for albumin and 2+ blood at that time. we performed a kidney biopsy to evaluate for persistent proteinuria 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. however, we failed to reveal viral particles in compatible ultrastructures. there are several reports about the AKI in H1N1 infected patients. the polymerase chain reaction of coronavirus fragments was detected in urine between the second and third weeks of viral infection. 26.7% of patients in our MERS-CoV cohort showed AKI. median time of AKI occurrence was 16 days from the onset of symptoms. kidney biopsy should be performed with thorough precautions. it could be helpful to monitor virus status in blood and urine samples from 2 weeks after onset of illness."}
