{"summary": "HCoV-NL63 is the fourth member of the coronaviridae family that infects humans. the genome of HCoV-NL63 has a gene order: 1a-1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N. the GC content of the HCoV-NL63 genome is extremely low. HCoV-NL63 is a member of the coronaviridae family that clusters together with arteri-, toro- and roniviruses in the order of the nidovirales. HCoV-NL63 is a variant that belongs to group 1 together with HCoV-229E and PEDV. the polyprotein undergoes autocatalytic cleavage by the viral papain-like proteinase and a chymotrypsin-like proteinase. some of the group 2 viruses encode a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) some of the group 2 viruses encode a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) in this study, we analyzed the genome structure of HCoV-NL63. we focus on the unusual nucleotide composition of the RNA genome. we describe in detail the bias in the nucleotide composition and its influence on the codon usage of this virus. we plotted the nucleotide count for individual genes and 5' and 3' non-coding regions. the highest U-count is found in the ORF3 and E genes. the lowest C-count is found in the 1a/1b and the 3' UTR. a biphasic pattern was described that separates the 1a/1b polyprotein genes and the structural genes. in the 1a/1b genes, the G:C ratio reaches high levels. for all coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, the 3' end of the genome displays a flattening of the curve. HCoV-NL63 prefers U (83%) over A (7%), C (8%) and G (2%) codon usage is shaped directly by the unusual nucleotide composition of the viral genome. the coronaviral addiction to the U nucleotide is most prominent in the \"free\" third position. 1.28 0.00 0.00 CUU 1.30 2.97 2.84 2.87 4.42 3.85 5.73 2.91 UUA 0.74 2.68 2.75 2.51 2.65 3.85 4.41 0.79 UUG 1.28 2.95 2.97 3.02 3.54 2.56 2.20 2.38 Ser UCA 1.20 1.49 1.38 1.92 1.33 0.00 0.44 2.91 UCC 1.76 0.33 0.30 0.59 0.00 1.28 0.00 0.26 UCU 1.49 3.06 2.76 3.98 2.21 0.00 3.

RNA of HCoV-NL63 (NL63 lane) was compared with RNA of MHV strain A59 (MHV lane) non-infected LLC-MK2 cells are included as a negative control (control lane) MHV RNA bands represent the complete genome (1) and sg mRNAs for S (2), ORF3 (3), E (4), M (5) and N (6). HCoV-NL63 has the most extreme nucleotide bias among the coronaviridae. the genomes with the lowest C-count (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and BCoV) have the highest U-count and vice versa (Figure 1). the change in the C- and G-count at two-third of the genome is statistically significant for all tested coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) this region encodes the structural proteins. HCoV-NL63 codon usage differs markedly from that of human mRNAs. the codon usage of HCoV-NL63 differs markedly from that of human mRNAs.

HCoV-NL63 has the most pronounced nucleotide bias among the coronaviridae. there is a significant fluctuation in the nucleotide count among the HCoV-NL63 genes. inspection of other coronaviral genomes confirms that C goes up (with highest significance in group 1 coronaviruses) and G goes down (with highest significance in group 2 coronaviruses) at two-third of the viral genome. he suggested that the 3'-terminal one-third of the viral genomic (-) strand is more likely to be single stranded because (-) sg mRNA synthesis on the (+) strand template frequently disrupts the protective this scenario explains the switch in nucleotide count at two-thirds of the viral genome. we show that U-counts reach the highest values and C-counts the lowest values at the third position of the HCoV-NL63 codons. the peculiar genome composition has a direct effect on the codon usage of HCoV-NL63. the core of the L TRS of group 1 coronaviruses is presented in the single stranded loop of a mini-hairpin. similar motifs were found in HCoV-NL63 (results not shown) the core sequence AACUAAA is conserved in the L TRS and all body TRSs, except for the E gene that has a single mismatch AACUA. nucleotide distribution was determined using a datasheet (300 nucleotide (nt) window and 10-nt step) codon usage was assessed using DNA 2.0 software. the level of significance of the nucleotide bias was established for 300-nt non-overlapping windows. the cDNA product was made into double-stranded DNA in a standard PCR reaction with 1.25 U of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) per reaction with appropriate primers. RNA was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) for generation of the HCoV-NL63 probe, the RT-PCR product was further amplified. the size of sg mRNA fragments of HCoV-NL63 were estimated from their migration on the Northern blot using the sg mRNA of MHV as size marker. sg mRNA sequences are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers: NC_005831.
