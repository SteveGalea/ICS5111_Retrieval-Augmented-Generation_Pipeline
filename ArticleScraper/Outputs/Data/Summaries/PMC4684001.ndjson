{"summary": "microcirculation comprises of arteries and veins to circulate blood to and from the organs. the venules collect blood from the capillaries and gradually coalesce into larger veins. the microvasculature constitutes an important interface for the delivery of nutrients, removal of toxic wastes, and fluid economy. vasoregression of the ocular vessels may also be induced in systemic vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. the same risk factors are important for retinal artery/vein occlusion, retinopathy, and macular degeneration. atherosclerosis can have several effects including ischemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease. the growth of atherosclerotic plaques occurs over many years and may remain silent for long periods. disease is often associated with hypertension and hyperglycemia. changes in the microvasculature may also cause end-organ damage in the retina, kidney, heart, and brain, highly perfused organs with low vascular resistance such as retina, kidney, heart, and brain. symptoms of DR can go unnoticed for a long time. recurrent bleeding can cause permanent vision loss. macular edema can cause blurring of vision. diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease leading to kidney failure and death. diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease leading to kidney failure and death. the vessel wall consists of two interacting cell types, EC and mural cells. ECs form the inner lining of the vessel wall, while MCs coat the outer surface. in larger vessels, the MCs are represented by vascular smooth muscle cells. the integrity, tightness, and mechanical strength of the endothelium is maintained by junctional structures that also provide a barrier to molecular transport. junctional structures in endothelial junctions can form multiprotein complexes with growth factors, and help to regulate vessel stabilization through control of EC responses. however, vessel regression may be caused by: a) insufficient stimulus during vessel formation leading to failure of stabilization of the vascular structure. in the eye, retinal capillaries have the highest density of pericytes. loss of pericytes either by migration or apoptosis marks the initiation of the process of vasoregression. lack of pericyte protection makes endothelium more susceptible and prone to damage. vasoregression is characterized morphologically by the formation of acellular capillaries in skeletal muscles of the neck, calf or foot in diabetic subjects. the formation of acellular capillaries in skeletal muscles of the neck, calf or foot in diabetic subjects has been observed in diabetic subjects. the occurrence of these characteristic features in skeletal muscle may be due to the underlying peripheral neuropathy in diabetes. VSMC migration forms an indispensable part of the pathological condition. it is regulated by growth promoters and inhibitors such as matrix metalloproteinases and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) once the plaque has been formed, VSMCs stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque by synthesis of ECM molecules. pericytes also manifest crosstalk between systemic inflammation and several vascular disorders. contradictory reports show abundance of pericytes in the retinal capillaries does not guarantee vascular stability in the retinal microvasculature. this loss of pericytes is attributed to endothelial hyperplasia, increased capillary diameter, abnormal shape/structure of EC. migration and alterations in the resting, quiescient phase is a shared feature of atherosclerosis and DR. endothelial damage Endothelial cells (EC) line the inner surface of blood vessels. systemic endothelial damage results in a cluster of diseases such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart diseases. te dropout is conceived as the primary step in endothelium reactivation and reducing endothelial protection. the endothelium, along with the junctional proteins occludins, claudins, and zona occludens proteins, comprise the functional part of BRB. this breakdown occurs secondary to the alterations in tight junctions, pericyte loss, EC loss, increased vesicular transport, and membrane permeability proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of VSMCs are vital for plaque rupture. VSMCs migrate from the media to the intima and proliferate in the intima. apoptosis over proliferation is instrumental in causing plaque rupture. perivascular pericytes have contractile fibers that wrap around the ECs of capillaries and venules throughout the body. the function of pericytes is not fully understood, but they have been found to regulate the microvascular diameter and blood flow. pericytes are also involved in maintenance, clearance, and phagocytosis of cellular debris. loss of pericytes is attributed to endothelial hyperplasia, increased capillary diameter, abnormal shape/structure of EC, modified/irregular shaped proteins, and alterations in junctional protein distribution leading to activation of pro-apoptotic pathways. recent studies show that the number of pericytes lost largely exceeds the number of pericytes lost by apoptosis. endothelial damage induces a state accompanied by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, pro-vasoconstriction, pro-oxidative stress, and proinflammation, resulting in atherosclerotic plaque formation and its sequelae. early clinical identification of the damaged endothelium may become an important tool in the prognosis of atherosclerosis. a blood vessel may lose its mural cell coverage either due to migration or apoptosis. in sustained inflammatory microenvironment, MC loss serves as a precedent for disruption of EC\u2013MC interaction. in sustained inflammatory microenvironment, MC loss serves as a precedent for disruption of EC\u2013MC interaction. inflammation leads to immature and unstable vessels with no pericyte recruitment. inflammation disrupted pericyte\u2013EC crosstalk. link between inflammation and retinal vasoregression is crucial and multifaceted. reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, EC activation and dysfunction, macrophage foam cell formation, SMCs migration and proliferation. Vasoregression in the diabetic retina may also result from hyperglycemia-induced modifications of levels and/or the chemical makeup of lipids and fatty acid-based hormones. hyperlipidemia-induced premature vessel atherosclerosis can also lead to hyperlipidemic vascular lesions and lipid infiltration into the retina. leukostasis is the attraction and adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular wall. this acute condition causes occluded circulation leading to the complications of headache, chronic ischemia, cerebrovascular incidents, and even death. leukostasis can be prevented by blocking or genetic elimination of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or CD-18. high dose anti-inflammatory agents reduced leukostasis, EC death, and suppressed BRB breakdown in diabetic rats. othelium plays a role in protection against inflammation, thrombosis, and CVD. depletion of EPCs may lead to endothelial dysfunction, which is marked as an initial event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. increased production of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) compounds are formed by a non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and proteins/lipids/nucleic acids. AGE compounds diffuse out of the cell and cause modification of ECM molecules, leading to cellular dysfunction. AGE also modify intracellular proteins, change their structure, cross-linking, enzymatic activity, receptor recognition, and impair their clearance. eicosanoids can increase angiopoietin Ang-2 expression directly or through VEGF expression, further leading to vasoregression. increased vascular permeability is altered during the inflammatory state. chronic vascular hyperpermeability is associated with pathological angiogenesis. prolonged stimuli of permeability-inducing agents such as VEGF can affect the barrier integrity, making the vessels fragile. increase in leukostasis, cytokines, growth factors, and acute inflammation leads to increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure and may finally result in the breakdown of the BRB. LRP1 also controls vascular remodeling by its effects on the TGF- signaling pathway. there exists a tight functional association between glial cells and retinal vasculature. there exists a tight functional association between glial cells and retinal vasculature. inflammation has been known to participate in endothelial desquamation. inflammatory mediators activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the subendothelial BM. inflammation also plays a vital role in plaque disruption and rupture. oxLDL is pro-atherogenic and marks the initiation of development of atherosclerotic plaque. this is followed by leukocyte attraction into the intima, ingestion of lipids by leukocytes, differentiation into foam cells, and proliferation of leukocytes, and EC. studies on bovine retinal capillary EC have very well established the impact of modified or oxLDL on retinal pericytes contributing to early DR. increased proinflammatory eicosanoids derived from eicoanoids combined with a decrease in anti-inflammatory 3 unsaturated fatty acids in the diabetic retina has been implicated in the development of vasoregression and neovascularization. an atherogenic diet triggers the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules that lead to the attachment of circulating monocyes and other leukocytes. leukostasis in retinal capillaries is also a cause of nonperfusion and death of retinal EC. loss of ECs exposes the BM and causes formation of a platelet/fibrin thrombus. loss of ECs exposes the BM and causes formation of a platelet/fibrin thrombus. loss of pericytes and formation of acellular capillaries. in DR, there is an altered number and functioning of EPCs. specific EPC subtypes may be important for disease prognosis, stratification, and therapeutic treatment of diabetic ME and proliferative DR. impaired function of EPCs may be restored by improving their mobilization, for example, by statins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), estrogen. hyperlipidemic stress was also found to cause upregulation of the receptor for AGE. increased levels of AGE have been reported in retinal vessels in DR. AGE induce apoptosis in retinal pericytes by activation of transcription factors like FOXO1 mediated by p38 and JNK MAP kinases. increased vascular permeability is altered during the inflammatory state. chronic vascular hyperpermeability is associated with pathological angiogenesis. vascular hyperpermeability is associated with pathological angiogenesis. glial Schwann cells provide myelination to the large axons and clear the cellular debris around the neurons. non-myelinating Schwann cells associated with small axons are critical for neuronal survival. glial cell activation occurs as an early event in vasoregression. glial cells, including astrocytes and M\u00fcller cells, become activated. pericytes and EC fail to maintain vascular integrity. the exact mechanism of microglial activation leading to vasoregression is still unclear. inflammatory VSMCs are first induced in the absence of PDGF pathway. PDGF-B and PDGFR receptor induce proliferation and migration of VSMCs. PDGF-B and PDGFR receptor induce proliferation and migration. mice possess very few pericytes, resulting in hyperdilated blood vessels. interrupting EC\u2013MC interactions by targeting the PDGF-B pathway also cause vascular destabilization and abnormal blood vessel remodeling. neurotrophins are a family of closely-related proteins that act as survival signals for neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system. neurotrophin pathway has been implicated in the development of cardiac ischemia and atherosclerosis. deregulated growth factor expression of neurotrophin signaling pathway like CNTF, FGF, NGF leads to early pericyte loss. upregulated expression of FGF2 and CNTF prior to vasoregression may have an association to microvascular degeneration. angiopoietin (Ang)-2/Tie-2 pathway is expressed on EC that binds to its vasoprotective, angiogenic ligand, Ang-1. Ang-2 antagonizes Ang-1 activity on Tie-2 and disrupts blood vessel formation. in the absence of VEGF, Ang-2 destabilizes the vessels by inducing ECs apoptosis. the Ang-2 system plays a critical role in detachment and migration of pericytes from microvasculature leading to pericyte loss. Ang-2 modulates intra- and preretinal vessel formation in eye. PPAR- has beneficial effects in vasculature by protecting against hypertension, inflammation, and oxidative stress. PPAR- has also been reported to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various ocular diseases such as macular degeneration (AMD), DR, keratitis, and optic neuropathy. PPAR- may emerge as a potential drug target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, as well as ocular diseases. PKC- participates in SMC apoptosis and deletion of this isoform leds to arteriosclerosis. however, additional isoforms may be involved in other steps of atherosclerosis. Activation of PKC isoforms may also trigger the impairment of vascular integrity. the participation of hexosamine pathway in vessel regression is still in its nascent stages. hyperglycemia enhances expression of certain growth factors like TGF. high glucose levels also increase ROS production, leading to formation of AGE compounds. NF-B activation NF-B is a widely expressed endothelial transcription factor regulating the key genes participating in inflammation, immune response, apoptosis, and proliferation. there is significant participation of transcriptional factors like NF-B in vessel remodeling (Grosjean et al., 2006). NF-B inhibitors reduce expression of inflammatory mediators. NF-B is also a key mediator for retinal cell apoptosis. VEGF protects the EC from apoptotic cell death. VEGF-A is a potent angiogenic agent and its prolonged signaling disrupts endothelial junctions. blockage of VEGF signaling disrupts the pericyte coverage of EC and causes EC apoptosis. VEGF promotes restoration of damaged endothelium under physiological conditions. anti-VEGF therapy is now being used for treatment of microvascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and DR. the complement pathway has a central but dual role in atherosclerosis. the classical complement pathway may be atheroprotective by removing cell debris and apoptotic cells from the atherosclerotic plaque. all PDGF family members can exist as disulfide-linked homodimers. the A and B isoforms can also form heterodimers. MCs are first induced in the absence of PDGF pathway but fail to proliferate in the growing blood vessels. neurotrophins have been implicated in both neovascularization and impaired angiogenesis. the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also critical in EC survival and vessel stabilization in the myocardium. neurotrophin pathway has been implicated in the development of cardiac ischemia and atherosclerosis. proNGF induces a potent angiogenic response in retinal EC. proNGF also induces a potent angiogenic response in retinal EC. the mechanism of this mutual regulation in modulating retinal vasculature is yet to be deciphered. angiopoietins are likely to have both pro-atherogenic and athero-protective effects in atherosclerosis. Ang-2 plays a critical role in detachment and migration of pericytes from microvasculature leading to pericyte loss in early retinopathy. studies on hypertensive and diabetic models have illustrated that PPAR- regulation of PI3K and MAPK contribute to vascular remodeling. PPAR- and activation has been found to reduce atherosclerosis progression by inhibiting the formation of macrophage foam cells. PPAR- increases plaque stability in atherosclerosis and prevents thrombogenicity. perturbations in vascular cell homeostasis caused by different PKC isoforms (PKC-, -1/2, and -) are associated with both large vessel (atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy) and small vessel (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) complications (Geraldes and King, 2010) lycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction has yielded positive results in clinical trials. inhibition of PKC in earlier stages of retinopathy may increase pericyte apoptosis in retinal capillaries. hexosamine biosynthetic pathway helps in the synthesis of amino sugars. all three MAPK pathways get activated by LDL and perform the function of apoptosis in the occurrence of vascular regression. an activated MAPK pathway regulates various transcription factors or kinases by phosphorylation leading to pericyte apoptosis. this also results in several ocular complications such as DR and uveitis. in atherosclerosis, high glucose levels trigger cytokine mediated proinflammatory state that causes increased NF-B activation. NF-B is activated early in diabetes and remains activated for up to 14 months. NF-B is also a key mediator for retinal cell death. VEGF protects the EC from apoptotic cell death. blockage of VEGF signaling disrupts pericyte coverage of EC. VEGF promotes restoration of damaged endothelium under physiological conditions. VEGF-A is a potent angiogenic agent and its prolonged signaling disrupts endothelial junctions, thus compromising the vascular integrity. the use of anti-VEGF agents in treatment of DR is still under investigation. similarities and unique features of microvascular disease in different tissues have been highlighted. ation-related changes may be the early and perhaps primary cause for target end organ damage. persistent hyperglycemia leads to overactivation of multiple pathways, oxidative stress, and decreased vasodilation. increased ECM production, BM thickening and enhanced vascular permeability damage the cellular structure and function. microvascular damage to the vasa vasorum takes place due to increased oxidative stress and inflammatory vasculopathy. clinical correlations have also been shown between chronic kidney disease, CVD, and neurological disorders. progressive retinopathy is likely to lead to complete loss of vision if unchecked. autonomic neuropathy may cause symptoms in various organ systems. both generalized and organ-specific exams are available for better diagnostics. electromyography may be used to determine subclinical forms of neuropathy. a range of techniques have been developed for evaluation of microcirculatory function in vascular disease. transcutaneous oxygen tension, skin pulp blood flow, iontophoresis, and capillaroscopy have been used for evaluation of microcirculatory function in health and disease. corneal confocal microscopy is a noninvasive technique that correlates with the severity of somatic neuropathy. noninvasive laser doppler-based methods have also been used to study microcirculation in the skin in the presence of peripheral or autonomic diabetic neuropathy. serum creatinine and microalbuminuria remain accepted end points for diagnosis of nephropathy. inflammatory cascade protein myeloperoxidase is released with neutrophil activation and implicated in endothelial dysfunction. inflammatory cascade protein myeloperoxidase is released with neutrophil activation and implicated in endothelial dysfunction. inflammatory C-reactive protein (CRP) produced primarily by liver is an established strong predictive biomarker for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, incident diabetes, incident hypertension, and the concentration of CRP rises exponentially during early hours of acute inflammatory conditions. higher concentrations have been strongly correlated with increased numbers of thin cap fibroatheromas. a single nucleotide polymorphism of CRP is associated with diabetes. the use of IL-18 has been suggested as a marker for future CV events only in men and requires future investigations. a significantly high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 has also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and ocular diseases such as DR. increased levels of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 have also been consistently associated with atherosclerosis and DR. increased serum levels of growth factors such as FGF-21 have been well demonstrated to be associated with atherosclerosis and DR. the phenomenon of vasoregression has been studied extensively in the eye. it is the initiating step in the development of vascular oculopathies. in the retina, vasoregression may lead to BRB breakdown. pathways denoted in red (Box 1) have been found to cause the effects enlisted in the red box. pathways in green (Box 3) prevent vasculopathies by inserting vasoprotective effects enlisted in the green box (Box 5). the commonalities between atherosclerosis and vasoregression shift the current view of DR as a local condition of the retina to a systemic, inflammation-induced vasculopathy."}
