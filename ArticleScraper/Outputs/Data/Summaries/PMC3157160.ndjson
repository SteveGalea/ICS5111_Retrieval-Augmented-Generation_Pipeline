{"summary": "R 0 is the most widely used epidemiological measurement of the transmission potential in a given population. it is a measure of initial disease spread, such that if R 0 > 1, then the disease can invade an otherwise susceptible population and hence persist. if R 0 > 1, the disease cannot successfully invade and will die out. in this paper, we outline the problems with R 0 and examine a number of alternatives that have been proposed. we include a worked example of malaria to demonstrate the many different results that the various methods give for the same model. the number of articles that use R 0 likely numbers in the tens of thousands. survival function is a generalised method of calculating the basic reproductive ratio that is not restricted to ODEs. a single human infects R H = 2 mosquitoes, each of whom infects R M = 3 humans. the next-generation method instead estimates R 0, N = 6 infected individuals in the subsequent generation, regardless of whether that generation is human or mosquito. the Jacobian matrix is used to linearise a nonlinear system of differential equations. around the disease-free equilibrium, the linear system will have the same stability properties as the nonlinear system if it is hyperbolic. however, for a system of n differential equations, this requires solving an nth order polynomial, which may be impossible. a j 0 under the constraint a 0 = 0 corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. this method is significantly easier to use than finding the largest eigenvalue at a 0 = 0 is 0. rearranging a 0 = 0 to produce R 0,C = 1 is not a unique process. the term +5I might represent, for example, new infections arising from vertical transmission, whereas the term 5I might represent a disease-specific death rate. this has the same threshold property as R 0,N = S/, but is clearly not the average number of secondary infections. van den Driessche and Watmough claim that only one choice of F is epidemiologically correct. next-generation method would calculate R 0, N = 6, which is a weighted average ( 2 6 3 ) of the number of infectives each individual produces in the next infection event. a single human directly infects two ticks (so R H = 2), each tick infects four animals (so R T = 4) and each animal infects three humans. rule 1 \u2014 For a trivial node i on a path j i k, the two arcs are replaced by j k with weight equal to the product of weights on arc j i and i k. the graph-theoretic method avoids calculation of V 1, which may be complicated for large systems. the graph-reduction method of de Camino-Beck et al. [14] applied to a vector-host model may not produce a unique R 0. R 0 = 1 2 [ 9 ( s + 9 ) c ( b + ) + 81 ( s + 9 ) 2 c 2 ( b + 4 m) the graph-theoretic method inherits existing problems from the next-generation method. existence of the Endemic Equilibrium R 0 can also be calculated from the endemic equilibrium. in the case of a backward bifurcation, the endemic equilibrium still exists for R 0 1. survival function is given by R 0, S = 0 ( the average number of susceptible individuals that an infected individual newly infects per unit time when infected for total time a) survival function produces the average number of secondary individuals infected by a single infected individual, in the same class. this is the number of humans infected by a single infected human via mosquitoes. calculating the first probability involves determining the probability that a human infected at time 0 exists at time t, the probability that a human infected for total time t infects a mosquito and the probability that an infected mosquito lives to be age a t. this is especially true for models with sufficient complexity, which are often encountered most frequently. the characteristic polynomial is n + a n 1 n 1 + + a 1 + a 0 = 0, (2) then a 0 = 0 is a threshold if a j 0 for all j. the nonconstant coefficients all being positive is a sufficient condition. the next-generation method suffers. the next-generation method is a mathematical generalisation of dividing negative values so that the eigenvalue threshold at zero is transformed into an R 0-like threshold at one. however, as we have seen, this does not produce a unique result. the next-generation method does not produce. the next-generation method would calculate R 0, N = 6, which is a weighted average ( 2 6 3 ) of the number of infectives each individual produces in the next infection event. a single human directly infects two ticks (so R H = 2), each tick infects four animals (so R T = 4) and each animal infects three humans (so R A = 3) the Graph-theoretic method in de Camino-Beck et al. derived a series of rules for reducing the digraph associated with F 1 V to a digraph with zero weight, from which = R 0. The rules are as follows. host birth and death rate, is the host recovery rate, c is the vector birth and death rate, and s and m are disease transmission coefficients. they found matrices F = ( 0 s m 0 ), V = ( b + 0 0 c ). this method still contains the same issues as the next-generation method. the graph-theoretical method of de Camino-Beck et al. [14] applied to a vector-host model may not produce a unique R 0. R 0 = 1 2. existence of the Endemic Equilibrium R 0 can also be calculated from the endemic equilibrium, in the case where there is a bifurcation at R 0 = 1. two different rearrangements give ( 1 q ) K > 1 or K + q > 1, (13) and note that either would suffice as an R 0 value. the only method which does is the survival function, but this method is too cumbersome to be used except for the simplest of models. the transmission rate from mosquitoes to humans is MH, while the transmission rate from humans to mosquitoes is HM. humans can be susceptible or infected, with birth rate H, background death rate H and disease-specific death rate. all eigenvalues will be negative if the constant term of the characteristic polynomial is positive. there will be an eigenvalue with positive real part if the constant term is negative. this is not the only rearrangement possible, so it is possible to rearrange by adding and subtracting arbitrary constants. it follows that there will be a biologically meaningful endemic equilibrium if H I > 0, or R 0, E = M H H M H S M S ( H + ) M > 1, (23) since M S = M / M and H S = H / H. this is not the only rearrangement possible. the curve labelled \u201cJacobian\u201d illustrates R 0,J, as given by (18) the curve labelled \u201cAdding and subtracting 9\u201d illustrates the value R 0,9 as given by (20). the curve labelled \u201cNext generation\u201d illustrates R 0,N, as given by (25). a backward bifurcation at R 0 = 1 may result in persistence of the disease when R 0 1. a point R a 1 such that the endemic equilibrium exists for R a R 0 1 and a third, unstable, equilibrium also exists. an endemic disease is only eradicated if 0 R 0 R a. the disease persists for all R 0 > 1 and is eradicated when R 0 = 1. there is a region R m R 0 R n, where three equilibria coexist. in this region, the outcome depends on the initial conditions. the authors presented a method for determining the minimum effort required to eradicate the infection from the endemic steady state. the model was extended to include an imperfect vaccine for dengue. this makes R 0 1 no longer sufficient for effectively controlling dengue in a community. the expected number of secondary infections at infection age u is given implicitly by R ( m, u ) = m ( 1 e u / k ), (26) where is the transmissibility and k is the mean number of connections per node. this model applies when the rate of infectious contact is independent of k. in a contact network framework, R 0 = T ( k 2 k k k ), (29) where T is the mean probability of transmission between individuals and k and k 2 are the mean degree and mean square degree of the network. a single pathogen may, therefore, have very different transmission dynamics depending on the population. the same value of R 0 can be associated to networks with distinct values of clustering coefficients and average shortest path length. this is because the correspondences between R 0 and the topological properties of the contact network are not one-to-one. if one region sustains the disease on its own, while the other does not, then sufficient travel of susceptibles (not infectives) could sustain the disease in both regions. if one region sustains the disease on its own, while the other does not, then sufficient travel of susceptibles could sustain the disease in both regions. the expected number of secondary infections in an infectious period of length u is given implicitly by R ( m, u ) = 0 u ( m R ) C I S ( t ) ( t ) d t, (27) where C IS(t) denotes the contact per susceptible neighbour and (t) denotes the infectiousness at time t after infection. a single pathogen may have very different transmission dynamics. if two networks have the same mean degree, k, then the one with the larger variance in degree, k 2k2 will be more vulnerable to the spread of disease. in populations with social or spatial structure, a chronic disease is more likely to invade than an acute disease with the same R 0, because it persists longer within each group. if both R 0,1 (0) 1 and R 0,2 (0) 1, there are conditions on the travel of susceptibles such that R 0,1 > 1 and R 0,2 1. if one region sustains the disease on its own, the other does not, then sufficient travel of susceptibles (not infectives) could sustain the disease in both regions. the duration of immunity ranges from transient to lifelong or where the demographic processes occur on comparable (or faster) timescales to disease processes. they found that the frequency of SSEs may decrease with the reduced movement and the group sizes due to the limited number of susceptibles available. this is illustrated by the classification tree analysis of the model results. extinction occurs with probability 1, but if R 0 > 1 then extinction occurs with some probability. problems include mismatch between an individual-based parameter and a population-level compartment model, and failure of R 0 to accurately measure an outbreak of a new disease. the flow of newly infected individuals is I(t) the average length of the infectious period equals the time expectation of the infectious period, which is 1/. in this case, R 0 does not signal epidemic growth as anticipated from other methods. obtaining R 0 from empirical contact-tracing data could produce misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, severity of an outbreak, and strength of the medical and/or behavioural interventions necessary for control. only an epidemic threshold parameter can be used to design control strategies. the effective reproduction number R(t) measures the number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case once an epidemic is underway. the effective reproduction number satisfies R(t) R 0, with equality only when the entire population is susceptible [40, 41]. lim t R 0 ( t ), Q 0 lim t Q 0 ( t ), (34) when the limits exist. however, R 0(t) is the average number of outgoing links of a removed compartment at time t. a single infective is introduced into a wholly susceptible population at a random time of the year. the condition R 0 1 is not sufficient to prevent an outbreak, since chains of transmission can be established during high-infectious seasons if D(t) > 1. the author offered a number of alternatives to determine whether an outbreak will occur. the spectral radius of M is an alternative approximation for R 0, which can be calculated via a weighted version of (28). the evaluation of extremely large, reasonably dense matrices (some highly active nodes may have hundreds of potentially infectious links) is difficult and time consuming, especially when this evaluation process must be repeated multiple times. all four reproduction numbers are strictly increasing functions of z and satisfy R 0 I R 0 I I R 0 I I I R 0 I V. these numbers allow a disease to be classified as mild (R 0 I R 0 R 0 II) or severe (R 0 III R 0 R 0 IV) despite all its flaws, R 0 is deeply flawed. it is not a measure of the number of secondary infections, it is never calculated consistently, and it fails to satisfy the threshold property. the next-generation method is probably the most popular, yet it suffers from uniqueness problems. it relies on after-the-fact calculations to determine the strength of disease spread. this limits its usefulness even further. an endemic equilibrium only persists if R 0 > 1 and that R 0 provides a direct measure of the control effort required for eradication. a simple, but accurate measure of disease spread must be accompanied by a declaration of which method was used, which assumptions are underlying the model. without such caveats, the concept of R 0 will continue to fail. two next-generation matrices derived R 0 and R 0V, the basic reproductive ratios for the unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. the two formulas are equivalent in the absence of the vaccine. they estimate R 0V = 1.4 in the absence of vaccine protection. the model has the property that the disease will be eradicated if T 0 1 but will persist if T 0 > 1. the model from which it derives does not quantify the transient dynamics, the timecourse of the infection or the prevalence of the disease. the simpler version of the model has the same eradication threshold (T 0) as more realistic, nonlinear models. the authors found that the shape of the generation-interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, they obtained an upper bound on the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. the pattern of secondary transmission follows a discrete probability distribution p k with k secondary transmissions. this approach accounts for demographic stochasticity, which can be crucial during the initial phase of an epidemic when the number of infected individuals is small. extinction was observed before growing to a major epidemic. west Nile Virus Wonham et al. examined the conflicting outbreak predictions for west Nile virus. they concluded that some transmission terms apply biologically only at certain population densities. they showed that six common North American bird species would be effective outbreak hosts. cholera values ranged from 3.1 in Indonesia (1993\u20131999) to 15.3 in Pakistan (1990\u20131995), with an average of 8.7. they then used the next-generation method to develop a theoretical estimate for R 0 that incorporates hyperinfectivity. this raises R 0 from approximately 3.2 when there is no hyperinfectivity to 18.2 when the contact with hyperinfected water is similar to contact with nonhyperinfected water. bluetongue virus, an insect-borne infectious disease of ruminants in Europe, was transmitted both horizontally (from host species to host species via mosquitoes) and vertically (via parent-to-offspring transmission in mosquitoes) they expressed the basic reproductive ratio as R 0 = R 0, V + R 0, H, (A.8) the first term represents the number of spores that successfully germinate in location 1. the second term represents the number of spores that successfully germinate in location 2. the second term represents the number of spores that successfully germinate in location 2. HIV Bacar et al. [49] developed a mathematical model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Kunming, china. they considered needle sharing between injecting drug users and commercial sex between female sex workers and clients. the basic reproductive ratio is expressed as R 0 max R 0 IDU, R 0 sex. X(t) is the incidence rate at time t, Y(t) is the prevalence at time t, and Y(t) is the average length of the infectious period. they illustrated their results for a staged HIV/AIDS progression model for homosexual men in the UK. they showed that R a was 13.81 and 17.01 in 1982 and 1983, respectively, but was much closer to 1 by the mid 1990s. the four methods involved (1) an early exponential growth rate, (2) an SEIR model, (3) a more complicated SEIR model with asymptomatic and hospitalised cases. these yielded average R 0 values of (1) 2.98, (2) 2.38, (3) 2.2, and (4) 2.1 during the first 17 days of the epidemic. in particular, uncertainty during the early part of the epidemic leads to a wide range of estimates for R 0. Chowell and Nishiura reviewed quantitative methods to estimate the basic reproductive ratio of pandemic influenza. they used the intrinsic growth rate to estimate R 0 in the range from 1.36 to 2.07. they defined the effective reproduction rate R ( t ) = 0 A ( t, ) d, (A.4) where A(t, ) is the reproductive power at time t. the entomological inoculation rate is the average number of infectious bites received by a person in a year. they made 121 estimates of R 0 for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in africa populations. they then revised the formula of R 0 to adopt potential sources of bias when biting is heterogeneous and when there is some transmission-blocking immunity. the square root sign represents the number of secondary reservoir infections caused by one infected vector. the second term under the square root sign represents the number of secondary vector infections caused by one infected reservoir. the square root gives the geometric mean of the two terms. the author illustrated three different methods to estimate R 0: (i) the final size equation, (ii) the intrinsic growth rate, and (iii) age distribution. the author pointed out that the estimates of R 0 most likely depend on the ecological characteristics of the vector population. the most significant changes in the estimation of R 0 were due to the mosquito biting rate, the extrinsic vector incubation period, the vector mortality rate, the probability of transmission from host to vector, and the ratio of vectors to cattle and sheep. plant pathogens van den Bosch et al. described a systematic method to calculate the basic reproduction ratio from knowledge of a pathogen's life cycle. authors used the next-generation method to calculate R 0 = R 0 p + R 0 s, (A.10) partitioned into primary and secondary infection. endemic level of infection is highly sensitive to changes in R 0 when R 0 > 1."}
