{"summary": "the etiology of diarrhea in neonatal foals is complex and involves infectious agents, management, and facilities, as well as nutritional, environmental, and physiological conditions. some studies of diarrhea in neonatal foals have focused on only one pathogen [2, 8\u201311] although it is usually caused by diverse combinations of enteric infections. a cross-sectional study was carried out at 15 horse farms (50\u2013150 horses per farm) all foals with diarrhea identified at each farm were included in the study. an average of 7.5 foals per farm was used. the 116 foals were divided into diarrheic and nondiarrheic groups. they were then subdivided into three groups according to age. GI (0\u201330 days of age); GII (31\u201360 days); and GIII (61\u201390 days). aliquots of fecal samples were kept frozen (80\u00b0C) in the laboratory. for the culturing of Escherichia coli, fecal material was plated on defibrinated sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar and evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours. each broth culture was plated in xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar and in bismuth sulfite agar. Suspected Salmonella sp. colonies were inoculated in triple sugar iron and lysine iron agar. a commercial agglutination test using polyvalent anti-Salmonella serum and serotype identification were also carried out. d with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, EcoT22I, and HindIII. plasmid samples were separated by electrophoresis and examined under UV light. PCR amplification performed as previously described. denalis DNA Detection DNA was extracted from fecal samples using a Qiagen DNA Stool Mini kit. amplification was performed using the set of primers previously described for detection of Cryptosporidium spp. [36, 37], G. duodenalis [38, 39], and L. intracellularis DNA [8, 40], with some modifications. study design Fecal samples were collected from 56 diarrheic and 60 nondiarrheic foals of different breeds up to 90 days of age. monoinfections and coinfections with different enteric pathogens were investigated, as well as selected virulence factors and toxin production. clinical abnormalities and hematological and blood gas parameters were also assessed in the diarrheic foals. total foals per farm; sampled foals with (56) and without diarrhea (60) per farms, range of age, and number of dead foals. all foals with and without diarrhea were nursed and considered to have ingested colostrum within the first 24 hours of life. 116 foals were divided into diarrheic and nondiarrheic groups. they were then subdivided into three groups according to age. aliquots of fecal samples were kept frozen (80\u00b0C) a multiplex PCR for a housekeeping gene (tpi), toxins A (tcdA) and B (tcdB) was performed on all suspected colonies. samples were inoculated into specifics Rappaport-Vassiliadis and Tetrathionate broth. each broth culture was plated in xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar. cnf-1, cnf-2, hly, vt1, vt2, sta, stb, ipaH, and eae, eaf, and bfp. target DNA for PCR amplification was based on reported vapA and vapB gene sequences. samples were tested for the presence of coronavirus using a RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene. the BCoV Kakegawa strain and PBS were used as positive and negative controls. chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequencies of different enteric pathogens between the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. clinical signs of dehydration and diarrhea were observed exclusively in the diarrheic foals. blood gas examination revealed 16% (9/56) of the foals had low pH (range 7.3 0.1) and blood bicarbonate levels. electrolyte imbalances were evident in the diarrheic foals, with 5.3% (3/56) exhibiting hypocalcemia, 66% (37/56) displaying hyponatremia and 39% (22/56) exhibiting hypokalemia. s 106/L (40) 9.3 (1.6) 7.9\u201312.0 Hemoglobin g/dL (45) 10.0 (4.8) 10.9\u201315.3 Hematocrit % (46) 35.2 (5.9) 33.0\u201348.0 PT (plasma) g/dL 6.8 (0.9) 4.3\u20137.0 Fibrinogen (mg/dL) 492.1 (237.5) 200\u2013500 Leucocyte 103/L 10.1 (4,97 no associations were observed between the hematological or blood gas parameters and the enteric agents assessed or the mortality rate among the foals. a tendency toward abnormal values of the hematological and blood gas parameters was observed in the foals with severe dehydration and signs of diarrhea. ichia coli fimH 4 (13.79) 4 (13.79) 8 (26.66) 2 (6.66) 5 (8.77) 9 (15.78) 32 (27.58) 0.097 Escherichia coli papC 1 (3.44) 0 (0.0) 1 (3.33) 0 (0.0) 2 (3.50) 2 (3.50) 6 (5.17) 1.000 Salmonella Saintpaul 1 (3.44) 0 (0.0) 1 (3.33) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.7 perfringens type A 7 (24.13) 2 (6.89) 4 (13.33) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.75) 4 (7.01) 18 (15.51) 0.033 C. perfringens type A cpb2+ 1 (3.44) 0 (00.00) 0 (0.0) 2 (6.66) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.75) 4 (3.44) 0.500 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 1 (3.44) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 2 (1.72) Cryptosporidium parvum 1 (3.44) 1 (3.44) 1 (3.33) 1 (3.33) 1 (1.75) 0 (0.0) 5 (4.31) 1.000 strongylus 2 (6.89) 2 (6.89) 1 (3.33) 1 (3.33) 3 (5.26) 8 (14.03) 17 (1 C. perfringens type A was isolated from 21% and 10% of the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. four of these strains were positive for the beta-2 toxin-encoding gene (cpb2), including three strains from apparently healthy animals and one from a diarrheic foal. salmonella serotypes were identified in single and combined infections. only four nondiarrheic foals tested positive for Salmonella. seventeen and 15 strains of Escherichia coli were isolated from the feces. salmonella typhimurium, E. coli ag43 and fimH;

Salmonella Typhimurium appears to be the most commonly reported pathogenic serotype in equines of different ages. in the current study, Salmonella Infantis, Typhimurium, and Saintpaul were the most prevalent serotypes recovered from the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. this result is not surprising because this organism is part of the normal enteric microflora of livestock. fimbriae and LT, STa, and STb enterotoxins among the E. coli strains isolated from diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals indicates that this organism has little influence on enteric infections in foals. papC gene was detected in four diarrheic and in two nondiarrheic foals up to 90 days of age. ag43 expression has been implicated in chronic urinary tract infections in humans. this study is the first to report identification of the ag43 gene among E. coli strains isolated from diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. none of 32 E. coli strains expressed verocytotoxins (vt1 and vt2) or eae. the vapA 85-kb type I and 87-kb type I plasmids are most frequently present in virulent R. equi strains in foals from Brazil. this is the first report of detection of VapA 85-kb type I and 87-kb type I strains in diarrheic foals in south America. lawsonia intracellularis was not detected by nested PCR in any of the fecal samples from foals. it was probably not detected because only foals up to 90 days of age were analyzed. coronaviruses are infectious viruses that affect a wide range of domestic animals, wildlife species, and humans. C. parvum has been identified at a high frequency (25%) in diarrheic foals in Trinidad. a significantly higher frequency has been detected in nondiarrheic animals. a low prevalence of S. westeri has been described in the united kingdom. the higher frequencies of S. westeri and Strongylus across the studied farms reflect the inadequacy of deworming control programs. a large number of enteric pathogens of bacterial, viral, and parasitic origins have been identified in diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. a high mortality rate was observed among the Salmonella-positive diarrheic foals, regardless of the serotype or other pathogens present. a large number of enteric pathogens of bacterial, viral, and parasitic origins have been identified in diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. a high mortality rate was observed among the Salmonella-positive diarrheic foals, regardless of the serotype. Salmonella spp. was the most prevalent pathogen associated with mortality among the diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals sampled. a wide variety of enteric pathogens in foals were identified in this study. the detection of different serotypes of Salmonella, toxigenic Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile strains highlights a public health concern. practitioners should be careful when handling fecal material from foals because these organisms are recognized as human pathogens through fecal contamination of food and water."}
