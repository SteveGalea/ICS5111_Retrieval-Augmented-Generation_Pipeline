{"summary": "bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. the main complication of viral respiratory infections is bacterial co-infection and respiratory failure. bacterial co-infection rates reported in children with respiratory illness are low. but the prevalence, clinical phenotype and course of bacteremia with pathogenic bacteria in the setting of acute RSV infection are questions that have not been investigated in sufficient detail. chromosomal abnormalities or any ongoing chronic disease were excluded from the study. a complete clinical record, a blood sample and a nasopharyngeal sample were collected in all participants. the severity of each respiratory episode was ranked as follows. PCR results were not shared with clinicians due to all PCR were performed simultaneously off-patient. 250ul of blood was mixed with 25ul lysozyme (100 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) and 10ul lysostaphin (1mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA), vortexed briefly and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. us pneumoniae ply 209 Haemophilus influenzae P6OMP 353 Group A Streptococcus mf 419 Group B Streptococcus cfb 154 Klebsiella pneumoniae mdh 193 Pseudomonas aeruginosa oprL 163 Escherichia coli phoA 196 Staphylococcus aureus femA 95 The first round reactions were performed in DNA extraction and PCR amplification of bacterial targets was performed by a commercial referral laboratory, Micropathology Ltd (MCP) all molecular PCR assays are validated to CPA standards. sensitivity of PCRs for all ten targets is 5 gene copies/reaction. analyses using R Software, version 3.0.2 (http://www.r-project.org) general data are presented as percentages or means with 95% confidence intervals. different statistical tests were used to assess the association between variables: Fisher\u2019s exact test for discrete variables and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. a nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for the study during hospitalization. a panel of 19 viruses including RSV was sought by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were previously described in Cebey-L\u00f3pez et al. [11] 200ul lysis buffer AL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added and samples were centrifuged at 5,500 rpm for 2 minutes to pellet the lysis beads. 200ul of the lysed blood sample was then transferred onto a Biorobot MDx (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and total nucleic acid extracted using silica membrane chemistry. nested PCR was then performed to detect the presence of ten different organisms. 1ul of first round template was transferred into 24ul of second round mastermix (MyTaqHS mastermix, Bioline Reagents, London, UK) containing second round primers at a final reaction concentration of 0.2uM for each primer and 1ul of Evagreen (Biotium, Hayward, California, USA) per reaction. second round reactions were performed on a lightcycler 480 (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the following cycling conditions. PCR was done after children discharge so results were not shared with clinicians. all PCR were performed simultaneously off-patient. the severity of each respiratory episode was ranked by physician criteria. patients with confirmed bacteremia had a more severe respiratory affection than those with no bacteria identified in blood. both the Wood-Downes score and the GENVIP scale indicated a worse value in the blood PCR positive patients (mean = 8.7 points and 17.0 points, respectively) conditions1 30.3% (20/66) 28.8% (17/59) 42.9% (3/7) 0.425 Medical history Premature1 4.8% (3/63) 3.6% (2/56) 14.3% (1/7) 0.302 Pneumococcal vaccine 48.5 (32/66) 52.5% (31/59) 14.3% (1/7) 0.106 Clinical data Oxygen needed1 80.3% (53/66) 78.0% (46/59) 100.0% (7/7) 0.329 Any kind of respiratory support1 27 the pathogen found were H. influenzae (n = 4), S. pneumoniae (n = 1) and both simltaneously (n = 2). the cycle thresholds were 20 except for S. pneumoniae in the co-infection cases. a total of 87.5% of the patients presented fever: > 38\u00b0C in 50% of the included children (24 out of 48), and low-grade fever in 18 of them (37.5%). a bacterial superinfection was confirmed by conventional blood cultures. the prevalence of bacteremia in children with RSV infection reported in the literature is low, ranging between 0.6 and 1.1%. in our series, only 14.3% of the PCR positive patients had been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, as compared to PCR negative ones. PCR was performed in all recruited patients but the clinical relevance of its positive result is not clear. the quantitative PCR and the cycle threshold value are inversely correlated with the bacteria load. in our cohort the cycle threshold was 20, but as we only have seven positive samples we could not establish maximum cutoff levels. infected children had a more severe course according to PICU admission rates, respiratory support necessity, clinical scales and length of hospitalization. PCR was only performed in blood, meaning that antibiotic prescription might be superfluous in up to 50% of the cases. bacteremia may actually occur and it should be suspected in the more severe cases.
