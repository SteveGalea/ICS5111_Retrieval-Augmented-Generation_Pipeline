{"summary": "humanized Mice in Virus Research Mice have played a central role in biomedical researches including those on infectious diseases. abundant knowledge of their genetics promoted their use as a model system. many human viruses do not infect mice. scid-hu thy/liv mice were used as an In vivo model of HIV-1 infection. scid-hu thy/liv mice were used for modeling of human herpesvirus 6 [11], human cytomegalovirus [12], sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infections [13], measles virus [14], and varicella-zoster virus [15]. scid-hu thy/liv mice were used for new-generation humanized mice were prepared by transplanting human hematopoietic stem cells to mice of various severely immunodeficient strains. humanized mice harboring both human hepatocytes and human immune system components were prepared that could reproduce HCV-specific immune responses and pathogenesis. in this review, we focus on humanized mouse models of human virus infections. we describe how they have been used for the reproduction of key features of human EBV infection, including pathogenesis, immune responses, and latent infection. fetal liver, thymus and HSC (NSG-BLT) T, B, NK cells, monocytes/ macrophages, dendritic cells HIV-1, Dengue, EBV [60,61,62,63] Rag2/IL-2rg/ Fah/ transplanted with human hepatocytes hepatocytes HBV, HCV [46] uPa/scid mice transplanted with human hepatocytes hepatocyte chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) and EBV-HLH-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) some of these EBV-associated diseases show uneven geographical distribution: EBV-positive burkitt lymphoma is endemic in equatorial Africa and New guinea. nasopharyngeal carcinoma is highly prevalent in southern china. a, oral hairy leukoplakia T/NK-cell LPD1 Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) Malignancies2 Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Pyothorax-associated lymphoma, large granular cell leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the elderly. latency II, characterized by the expression of EBNA1, LMP1, LMP2A, EBERs, and BARTs, is found in CAEBV, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. latency III, characterized by the expression of all nine EBV proteins and two sets of EBV RNAs expressed in LCLs, is seen in PTLD and AIDS-associated lymphoma. scid-hu scid mice transplanted intraperitoneally with PBMC of EBV-seropositive donors developed acute B-cell lymphomas [19]. engraftment of EBV-transformed LCLs also induced similar B-cell LPD in scid-hu scid mice. ected B cells in scid-hu PBL mice were found dependent on co-presence of uninfected CD4+ T cells, suggesting their essential role in in vivo proliferation and survival of EBV-transformed cells. analysis on IFN- gene polymorphism indicated that the A/A genotype for the base +874 was more prevalent in PBLs inducing aggressive lymphoproliferation in scid-hu PBL mice. expression of EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1 and LMP2A was demonstrated in this B-cell LPD. expression of latency III type of EBV gene expression and immunohistochemistry showed the expression of CD23 and other B-cell activation markers. gene expression of latency III type of EBV gene expression was observed in humanized mice. rradiation, CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood, intrahepatic B cells, myeloid cells Akata and EGFP-tagged B95-8, intrasplenic B-cell LPD in latency II [28] balb/c Rag2/IL-2rg/ (BRG), newborn, 4 Gy irradiation CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood, intrahepatic B, cells, T cells, dendritic cells B95-8, intraperitoneal B- cytokinemia, hemophagocytosis, systemic infiltration of CD8+ T cells, signs of HLH [53] NOD/LtSz- scid IL-2rg/ (NSG), 2-5 days, 100 cGy irradiation CD34+ cells isolated from fetal liver, intrahepatic B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells Unspecified intraperitoneal E specific CTL [83], IL-2-activated NK cells [84], anti-CTLA-4 antibody [85], rituximab and IL-2 in combination [86], GM-CSF and IL-2 in combination [87], low-dose IL-2 in combination [88], and the combination of CD13/CD19-bispecific antibody, CD28 specific antibody, and autologous T cells [89] were evaluated using scid-hu PBL mice with EBV- EBV-HLH is the most common and severest type of virus-associated HLH. it is characterized by monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected T (most often CD8 + T) or NK cells. hu-NOG mice reported on exaggerated CD8+ T-cell responses. xenogeneic transplantation of PBMC obtained from patients with EBV-HLH to NOG mice also reproduced cardinal features of EBV-HLH. clinical features of HLH, mostly caused by overproduction of cytokines by CD8+ T cells and macrophages, include fever. FN- cytokinemia in hu-NOG mice compared to earlier findings from hu-NOG mice. hu-NOG mice exhibited normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. results suggest EBV infection in B cells may also cause similar HLH. rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by synovial proliferation and destruction of bone and cartilage tissues, is a common autoimmune disease associated with progressive disability and systemic complications. since the late 1970s, evidence has accumulated suggesting possible involvement of EBV in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. rheumatoid factor and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptides were not detected in hu-NOG mice presenting arthritis. rheumatoid factor and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptides, two representative markers for RA, were not detected in mice presenting arthritis. scid-hu scid mice transplanted intraperitoneally with PBMC of EBV-seropositive donors developed acute B-cell lymphomas [19], indicating that lymphoma cells were EBV-positive and expressed EBNA2 and LMP1. studies with scid-hu PBL mice provided valuable insights into the mechanism of EBV-induced lymphoproliferation In vivo. new-generation humanized mice were prepared by transplanting human HSC to immunodeficient mice of various strains. adenosine at +874 was associated with inefficient CTL restimulation. adenosine at +874 was associated with inefficient CTL restimulation. earliest works on EBV infection of new-generation humanized mice used NOD/scid mice transplanted with human HSC where reconstitution of B cells and myeloid cells, but no T cells were demonstrated [28]. EBV-positive LPD generated in these mice is therefore considered to have developed without the influence of T-cell immunosurveillance. no irradiation CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood, intravenous B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells Akata, itravenous, intraperitoneal B-cell LPD, latent infection, erosive arthritis resembling RA. no irradiation CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood, intravenous B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macr cid IL-2rg/ (NSG) with HLA-A2 transgene, 2-5 days, 100-150 cGy irradiation CD34+ cells isolated from fetal liver, intrahepatic B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells Unspecified intraperitoneal EBV-specific T-cell responses restricted by HLA-A2 [31,93] NOD/LtSz- EBNA2-driven expression of a thymidine kinase in transplanted LCL cells enabled complete regression of transplanted cells by the administration of ganciclovir. fusion protein of EBNA1 carboxy terminus and the heavy chain of anti-DEC-205 antibody primed EBNA1-specific IFN-secreting T cells and induced anti-EBNA1 antibodies. clinical features of HLH, mostly caused by overproduction of cytokines by hu-NOG mice exhibited normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. results suggest that EBV infection in B cells may also cause similar HLH. xenogenees may also have an influence on the outcome of EBV infection. PBMC obtained from patients with EBV-HLH to NOG mice also reproduced cardinal features of HLH. clinical features of HLH, mostly caused by overproduction of cytokines by CD8+ T cells and macrophages, include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia. fected hu-NOG mice may be useful as an experimental model for EBV-HLH. results suggest that EBV infection in B cells may also cause similar HLH. hu-NOG mice used same hu-NOG mice to observe predominantly B-cell LPD. a large number of activated CD8+ T cells specific to EBV-encoded proteins are present in affected joints. infection with EBV and expression of EBERs and LMP1 were demonstrated in synovial cells of RA lesions. a number of infected cells were demonstrated in the bone marrow adjacent to affected joints. rheumatoid factor and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptides were not detected in mice presenting arthritis. rheumatoid factor and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptides, two representative markers for RA, were not detected in mice presenting arthritis. antibody specific to human class-I MHC inhibits production of IFN- by CD8+ T cells following stimulation with autologous LCL. human MHC class I tetramers presenting EBV epitopes identified EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in hu-NOG mice [53]. the development of human T cells was retained in humanized NOG I-A/ mice. this suggests that murine MHC is involved in the positive selection of human T cells. human HSC-derived cells, possibly B cells or dendritic cells, are also involved in the positive selection of human T cells. the lack of human follicular dendritic cells in humanized mice may also be involved in the inefficiency of class switching. persistent infection reminiscent of EBV latency in humans was reproduced in hu-NOG mice inoculated with low doses of the virus. RT-PCR analysis of RNA obtained from the spleen or liver of these persistently infected mice showed the expression of EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1 and LMP2A, consistent with the presence of latency III cells. however, persistent EBV infection in hu-NOG mice did not appear to recapitulate all aspects of EBV latency in humans. EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C and LMP1 have been shown to play essential roles in the process of transformation. knocking-out of the EBNA3B gene by homologous recombination did not affect the in vitro transforming ability of the virus. a critical role for EBNA3B in the life cycle of EBV had been supposed. the results indicated that BZLF1 enhances lymphoma genesis by inducing abortive lytic infection. there are a number of EBV genes such as BHRF1 (encoding an Bcl-2-like anti-apoptotic protein) [107], BXLF1 (encoding EBV thymidine kinase) [108], BCRF1 (encoding viral IL-10) [109], loss-of-function mutants of which exhibited no the nature of these diseases strongly suggests that in a specific condition EBV can infect T and NK cells and induce their proliferation. many features were common to CAEBV and EBV-HLH model mice. but the findings of hemorrhagic lesions and hypercytokinemia were unique to the latter model. resembling RA in humanized mice rationalizes a search for lesions and symptoms of other autoimmune diseases in humanized mice. humanized mice may be a powerful tool for testing the effects of such cofactor candidates in vivo. humanized mice may be a powerful tool for testing the effects of such cofactor candidates in vivo. oral transmission is a critical initial step in primary EBV infection. symptoms of IM appear only after long incubation period of 3\u20137 weeks. humanized mouse may be an ideal tool and critical early innate responses to EBV might be revealed in humanized mice. humanized mice may be a powerful tool for testing the effects of such cofactor candidates in vivo. humanized mice may be a powerful tool for testing the effects of such cofactor candidates in vivo. humanized mice may be a powerful tool for testing the effects of such cofactor candidates. preliminary trials of oral inoculation of EBV to humanized mice have not been successful. this result suggests that replication in epithelial cells is an essential step in primary EBV infection. it is highly desirable that this natural route of transmission is reproduced in humanized mice. supplementation of human cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-4, M-CSF, IL-7, IL-15, and EPO has been reported to improve the development and/or maintenance of human immune system components. improved protocols, as well as introduction of human MHC transgenes described above, will eventually realize humanized mice with the capacity of immune responses comparable to those in humans."}
