{"summary": "animal housing, experimental design, and diets were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Iowa State University in Ames, IA. pigs were housed in two rooms at the Livestock Infectious Disease Isolation Facility (biosecurity level 2) at the Livestock Infectious Disease Isolation Facility. thionine 0.16 l-Threonine 0.13 l-Valine 0.07 Salt 0.40 Vitamin\u2013mineral premix1 Calculated composition ME, kcal/kg 3,408 SID Lys, % 1.35 STTD P, % 0.40 SID, standardized total tract digestibility. dpi 0, PEDV pigs were inoculated via intragastric gavage. the pig selected for blood collection was the pig that was euthanized at dpi 20. the pig was euthanized by sodium pentobarbital overdose immediately followed by exsanguinated. whole jejunum sections were collected 2 m prior to the ileal\u2013cecal junction. they were flushed of luminal contents with Krebs\u2013Henseleit buffer. jejunum sections were placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 24 h. the procedure was performed using a commercially available system (Leica Bond-III, Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia) diluted probe was applied and allowed to hybridize at 45 \u00b0C for 12 h. then rinsed prior to incubation with an antifluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. anti-Ki67 antibody was used to detect proliferating stem cells in the jejunal crypts. primary antibody was added at 1:500 (v/v) and mouse-on-Farma horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-Polymer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) was used as secondary. LD Proteolysis Markers Protein from snap-frozen LD was collected after homogenization in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X 100, and 0.1% SDS) gels were run under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the proportions of the -calpain catalytic subunit present as the intact 80 kDa band and the autolyzed 78 and 76 kilodalton bands were calculated. myofibrillar protein and easily releasable myofilaments (ERMs) were extracted from LD as previously described. the activity of PEPCK was calculated by subtracting endogenous ATP concentration in homogenates from ATP produced in the presence of oxaloacetate. assay mixture after the formation of ATP was diluted 10-fold and 100-fold for liver and jejunum mucosal scrapings. pig was the experimental unit for growth performance, while pig was the experimental unit all other parameters, with fixed effects of dpi (5 or 20), treatment (Control or PEDV), and their interaction. the effect of dpi on Ct in PEDV pigs and the effect of treatment on growth performance parameters were analyzed. barrows and gilts 4 wks of age, approximately 1 wk post-wean (BW = 8.46 0.50 kg) were obtained from a PEDV negative herd, weighed, and allotted based on sex and BW to one of two treatments. each treatment was represented by eight pens with two pigs each. 1,653 IU vitamin D3, 33.1 IU vitamin E, 4.4 mg vitamin K, 6.6 mg riboflavin, 38.9 mg niacin, 22.1 mg pantothenic acid, 0.04 mg vitamin B12, 1.1 mg I as potassium iodide, 0.30 mg Se as sodium selenite, 60.6 mg Zn as zinc oxide, 36.4 mg Fe as ferrous sulfate, 12.1 mg Mn as manganous oxide, and PEDV detection in feces of pig inoculation with PEDV at dpi 2, 5, 10, 15, and 201 Parameter Dpi SEM P-value 2 5 10 15 20 Ct2 29.15a 21.01b 31.52a 32.69a 33.50a 1.826 0.001 Positive/Total PCR3 5/8 8/8 6/8 2/8 1/8 \u2013 \u2013 ISH4 \u2013 7/8 \u2013 \u2013 0/8 \u2013 \u2013 jejunum sections were placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 24 h and then into 70% ethanol for short-term storage until further processing. jejunum sections were cut longitudinally to expose the mucosa. diluted probe was applied and allowed to hybridize at 45 \u00b0C for 12 h. then rinsed prior to incubation with an antifluorescein isothiocyanate. a score for PEDV presence was assigned by a trained, blinded individual to each jejunum section. primary antibody was added at 1:500 (v/v) and mouse-on-Farma horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-Polymer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) was used as secondary. glucagon concentration was measured in duplicate using commercially available ELISA kit. Membranes were washed with TBST with 5% NFDM. secondary antibody was added at 1:1,000 or 1:2,500, respectively, in TBST with 2.5% NFDM. -calpain catalytic subunit present as the intact 80 kDa band and the autolyzed 78 and 76 kilodalton bands were calculated. western blot of intact -calpain illustrated by the 80-kilodalton band and the autolyzed 78- and 76-kilodalton bands. assay mixture after formation of ATP was diluted 10-fold and 100-fold. glucose-6 phosphatase (G6P) activity was measured in duplicate using protocol EC 3.1.3.11 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with modifications. the effect of dpi on Ct in PEDV pigs and the effect of treatment on growth performance parameters were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) the model included treatment and dpi and the interaction of treatment and dpi as fixed effects. all sampled PEDV challenged pigs were PCR-positive for PEDV. only one out of eight pigs sampled had PEDV detectable in feces by RT-PCR. a 25% overall (dpi 0 to 20) reduction (P = 0.004) in feed efficiency in PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. this resulted in a 25% overall (dpi 0 to 20) reduction (P = 0.004) in feed efficiency.

Rotavirus infects enterocytes and causes similar clinical signs of diarrhea and dehydration. the rebuilding intestinal epithelial layer requires energy and nutrients for recovery. Sepsis increased m-calpain protein abundance and release of myofilaments from the myofibrillar fraction of the rat extensor digitorum longus muscle compared with nave controls. infusing rats with TNF- or IL-1, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulted in increased total muscle protein breakdown and increased myofibrillar protein breakdown. there were no differences in unautolyzed -calpain (80 kilodalton) and autolysis products (78 and 76 kilodalton) or calpastatin abundance in LD of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. there was an increase in 20S proteasome activity at dpi 5 in LD of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. digitorum longus muscle compared with healthy counterparts. pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 inhibits the anabolic effect of insulin in muscle. gluconeogenesis is important for maintenance of blood glucose. we speculate that the increased feed intake observed in PEDV pigs was sufficient in supplying energy and nutrients to the intestinal epithelium for restitution. however, the energy and nutrients needed to recover the epithelium may be originating from available luminal nutrients instead of muscle proteolysis."}
