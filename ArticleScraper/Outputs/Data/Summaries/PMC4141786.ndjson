{"summary": "a total of 948 subjects (381 KD and 567 controls) were recruited. there were no significant association in KD with regards to CAL formation and IVIG treatment responses. the most common sequel of KD is coronary artery lesions (CAL) formation. the most common sequel of KD is a coronary artery lesions (CAL) formation. 2,6-linked sialylated IgG was reported to interact with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209). this triggers an anti-inflammatory cascade that promotes the up regulation of inhibitory FcRs on macrophages. CAL was defined as the internal diameter of the coronary artery greater than 3 mm (4 mm, if the subject was more than 5 year-old) a total of 567 control subjects were recruited from patients of outpatient department who volunteered to participate in our study while receiving an allergen test and with a negative allergen test result. genetyping was performed by using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was accomplished by using ABI StepOnePlus Thermal Cycler. genotypes and allele frequencies associated with the susceptibility of KD and disease outcomes were analysis by 2 test. genetyping was performed using the Han Chinese in Beijing as a reference population sample. there are 4 SNPs (rs4804800, rs11465421, rs1544766, rs1544766, rs4804801) located on 3\u2032 UTR. LD was assessed using the default setting of the Haploview software 4.1. 126 (33.1%) patients had coronary artery lesion (CAL) and 49 (12.9%) patients suffered from persistent fever after they treated with IVIG. rs8112310 AA 51 (13.7) 66 (12.2) 0.361 0.359 0.5292 1.13 (0.77\u20131.68) AT 168 (44.9) 256 (47.4) TT 155 (41.4) 218 (40.4) rs4804800 GG 46 (12.8) 45 (8.4) 0.336 0.309 0.0336 * 1.60 (1.04\u20132.46) AG 149 (41.5) 240 (45.0) AA 164 (45.7) 249 (4 AA 231 (70.9) 213 (64.4) rs735240 AA 14 (3.9) 37 (7.3) 0.215 0.265 0.0337* 0.51 (0.27\u20130.95) AG 128 (35.2) 195 (38.4) GG 221 (60.9) 276 (54.3) rs4804804 AA 77 (22.9) 87 (20.7) 0.476 0.429 0.4550 0.80 (0.56\u20131.14) AG 166 (49.4) GG 15 (12.6) 31 (13.1) 0.315 0.346 0.8997 0.96 (0.50\u20131.85) AG 45 (37.8) 102 (43.0) AA 59 (49.6) 104 (43.9) rs11465421 TT 4 (3.4) 15 (6.6) 0.252 0.247 0.2142 0.50 (0.16\u20131.50) GT 52 (43.7) 83 (36.2) GG 63 (52.9) 131 (57.2) rs a P values are calculated using the Pearson's x2 test for the recessive model. b ORs are for the recessive model (minor allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes and major allele homozygotes) rs735239 GG 2 (4.7) 7 (2.5) 0.131 0.163 0.4016 1.08 (0.23\u20134.96) AG 7 (16.7) 78 (27.6) AA 33 (78.6) 197 (69.9) rs735240 AA 2 (4.2) 12 (3.9) 0.177 0.218 0.9251 1.08 (0.23\u20134.96) AG 13 (27.1) 111 (35.9) GG 33 (68.7) 186 (60.2) r CD209 gene linkage disequilibrium and haplotype block structure in KD. the number on the cell is the LOD score of D\u2032. the number on the cell is the LOD score of D\u2032. the basal characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease and normal controls are shown in Table 1. the GG genotype of rs4804800 had 1.60-fold increased risk compared with AG and AA genotypes of KD (P = 0.0336, OR (95% CI) = 1.60 (1.04\u20132.46) (%) 247 (66.8%) 314 (56.2%) Mean (SD) age (years) 1.71.6 5.74.9 Age range (years) 0\u201311 0\u201351 CAL formation 126 (33.1%) IVIG resistance 49 (12.9%) CAL: coronary artery lesions; IVIG: intravenous immunoglobulin; SD: standard deviation. b ORs are for the recessive model (minor allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes and major allele homozygotes) CD209 polymorphisms had no association with CAL and IVIG treatment responsiveness.

CD209 can recognize many pathogens, such as viruses (HIV-1, dengue, and measles virus) [26], [27], [28], bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) [29], and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus) [30] contributing to the generation of pathogen-tailored immune responses and immunosuppressive responses by the MAPK pathway our results provided evidence to support the potential role of CD209 in the susceptibility of KD in a Taiwanese population. the roles of genetic polymorphisms of CD209 in inflammatory signaling as well as KD development are still unclear."}
