{"summary": "METHODS Cell Culture and Reagents A549, Vero cells (ATCC) and human hepatoma 7 (Huh7) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes; Life technologies), 1% L-glutamine (2 mM; Life technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( in case of flaviviruses, formalin-fixed cells were stained with crystal violet (Sigma) for each dilution, immunofluorescent foci or plaques were counted and averaged before calculating focus-forming units (FFU) or plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. standard operating protocols were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. cell culture and reagents A549, vero cells (ATCC) and human hepatoma 7 (Huh7) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes; Life technologies), 1% L-glutamine (2 mM; Life technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ modified Eagle's medium contains 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. four days after infection, cells were washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 10% formalin for 48 hours. cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay (Promega) as per manufacturer's protocol. DMSO or alisporivir (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 10 M) in DMSO. alisporivir treatment A549 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 12 or 24 wells plates. no significant changes in cytotoxicity were observed when cells were incubated with alisporivir at 5 M for 2 days. cell growth occurred in this time frame in this time frame in presence of 10 M alisporivir. luminescence values are shown with the percentage viability indicated above each bar. viability indicated above each bar as compared to treatment with vehicle. alisporivir was replenished in the medium every 48 hours for up to 9 days of infection. TBEV, KFDV, and POWV all showed considerable susceptibility to alisporivir. Huh7 cells were infected with EBOV-Makona and TBEV at a MOI of 0.01. alisporivir elicited a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of TBEV replication beginning at 2.5 M. replication of EBOV is only inhibited in the presence of relatively high concentrations of alisporivir. alisporivir significantly reduced the replication of EBOV-Makona at the highest concentration tested. alisporivir was the most clinically advanced inhibitor of CypA, alisporivir. alisporivir treatment resulted in a significant reduction in replication of multiple tick-borne flaviviruses, with TBEV (strain Sofjin) exhibiting the highest susceptibility. TBEV remained susceptible if alisporivir was added to cultures at 24 hours after infection, well after virus replication is established. this work demonstrates that cyclophilins are likely important host factors for TBEV replication, whereas our data do not support a dominant role for"}
