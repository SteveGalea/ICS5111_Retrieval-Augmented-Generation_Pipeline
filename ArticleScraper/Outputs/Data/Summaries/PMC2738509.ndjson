{"summary": "patients were under the routine care of one or more of the authors, each an experienced senior academic infectious diseases pediatrician. AFRIMS has provided such dengue diagnostic services to Bangkok Children\u2019s Hospital. a deNV IgM-to-IgG ratio >1.8 defined a primary infection. with serial specimens, twofold increase in IgG to DENV with an absolute value of >100 U indicated a secondary infection in the absence of IgM to DENV of >40 U. routine diagnostic tests were provided for infants and children admitted to children\u2019s hospital, Yangon, by the Virology Department. fiscal constraints limited the number of serologic tests performed. individual data were disassociated from any identifiers. in 1964, 17/1,000 seven-month-old infants, more than 1% of the population that age, were hospitalized for DHF/DSS (17) this modal rate was two times higher than the 1964 modal hospitalization rate for children (age 4 years, data not shown) in Bangkok during the same year (17). in our present study, infant DHF/DSS constituted 4.9%, 4.6%, 5.0%, and 4.9% of 4,872; 14,053; 8,938; and 2,057 Thai children hospitalized with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome show the classical bimodal curve: relatively few cases in children 12\u201324 months of age and a modal age later in life, in this case at 8 years of age. nearly all infants in the large Thai and most in the smaller Myanmar groups had primary DENV antibody responses. the characteristic and unique age-specific hospitalization curves are consistent with published observations that describe infant DHF/DSS occurrence during primary DENV infections. 13 infants were admitted to hospital at different ages in the first year of life. every mother in the study had had two or more previous DENV infections (8). all infants acquired DHF/DSS during the short window of time. most cats naturally exposed as adults to FIPV develop antibody titers without showing clinical signs. lesions in sick cats are believed to result from immunologically mediated responses (9,10,21) the feline coronaviruses can be divided into two serotypes, I and II, on the basis of cross-reactivity to canine coronavirus in virus neutralization assays (26). type I viruses grow poorly in tissue cultures and show virtually no neutralization with anti\u2013canine coronavirus sera (27) type II viruses grow readily in vitro (28) antibody-dependent enhancement is believed to be the cause of vaccine failure after immunization with live (35,36) or recombinant (37) vaccines. inoculation with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the S protein FIPV 79-1146 sensitized cats."}
