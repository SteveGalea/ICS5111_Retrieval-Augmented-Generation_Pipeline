{"summary": "well-appearing febrile infants (FI) with viral respiratory infections have reduced risk of bacterial infections (BI; urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, meningitis) but few data exist on the risk of concomitant BI in HRV-positive FI. risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19\u20130.88)] but with wide CI approaching 1 suggesting this may not be clinically meaningful. infants with HRV were at higher risk of BI than infants with non-HRV infection."}
