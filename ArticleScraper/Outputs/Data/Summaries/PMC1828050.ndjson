{"summary": "complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human mammalian and avian species. consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions. the family of astroviridae is divided in two genera. the pathogen is a non-enveloped virion with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 6.8 kb in size. the virus genome contains three open reading frames designated ORF1a (2.8 kb), ORF1b (1.6 kb) and ORF2 (2.4 kb) phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood offers a set of sophisticated models to assess the extent of (non-) synonymous substitutions in genes. the current status of the PAML programs displays a profound documentation for the inference of sites and branches prone to molecular adaptation. dN/dS values do not exceed 0.16, except for ORF2 in the cat and human4 isolates. unrooted dN and dS trees are part of PAML's output. unrooted dN and dS trees are part of PAML's output. human8 AF260508 0.0075 0.1508 0.0497 0.0033 0.1802 0.0183 0.0536 0.4412 0.1215 Sheep Y15937 0.3386 28.9094 0.1369 8.2335 0.0166 0.2367 46.6085 0.0051 Mink AY179509 0.2348 24.9745 0.0094 0.1357 32.7666 0.1904 Pig AB037272 0.2204 28.9632 0.0076 Turkey1 the scale bars indicate the relative extent of mutational rates as (non-) synonymous substitutions per (non-) synonymous site corrected for multiple hits at the same site. the dN trees of the three ORFs (Fig 1A) are in close agreement with the widely accepted astrovirus phylogeny [10,16-21] dN trees of VP34 and VP27 are nicely deep-rooted and nearly identical to the dN tree of the complete ORF2. dS values of sheep virus capsids increase from 36.5 in VP34 to 64.4 in VP27, while these values decrease from 53.3 to 12.3 in mink. the difference is even more dramatic, 60.6 in VP34 and only 4.8 in VP27. values for (non-)synonymous mutational rates and dN/dS ratios in astrovirus capsid protein genes Species VP34 and VP27 of ORF2 display mutually independent patterns of molecular evolution. s tolerate considerable differences with respect to the extent of synonymous mutational rates as estimated by means of PAML. the viral species available are mentioned in the first column and specified by their accession numbers. it cannot be excluded that even PAML encounters saturation-related problems at high rates of mutation in a properly aligned set of sequences. a dN/dS value of 1 marks the transition from neutral evolution to weakly positive selection. all sites are plotted as a string of local dN/dS values. this is more easily observed when all sites are plotted as a string of local dN/dS values superimposed on a map of virus functions embedded in the ORF. sites prone to positive selection in astrovirus genes Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) Analysis BEB positively selected sites in ORF1a Position in Alignment Amino acid residue Position in H1Z25771 Posterior mean value for dN/dS SE for dN/dS Posterior probability (dN/dS > 1) 3 Y 3 0.988 0.576 0.522 109 K 86 1.474 0.225 0.9 0.551 537 L 476 1.282 0.396 0.717 604 S 513 0.264 0.901 686 T 583 1.094 0.478 0.537 716 K 612 1.078 0.468 0.507 745 S 633 1.182 0.430 0.603 755 S 643 1.183 0.430 0.606 764 H 652 1.172 0.438 0.599 768 S 656 1.350 0.357 0.797 774 N 658 1.2 the BEB-derived value of dN/dS is plotted against the position of the residue in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF (X-axis) Arrows and scale bars indicate sites proposed for proteolytic digestion and predicted for phosphorylation (T, Y and S in ORF1b) the dN/dS distribution in ORF1b illustrates the power of purifying selection even more dramatically. almost all sites in the conserved polymerase domain have dN/dS values far below 0.25 to 0.3 being the transition region from purifying selection to neutral evolution. dN/dS values tend to increase towards neutral evolution. the limited data set prevents a statistical discrimination between sites with dN/dS values = 1 due to either weak but bona fide positive selection or merely site-specific heterogeneity. RNS, KGD and RHD oligopeptides are absent in the collection of ORFs2. but the integrin-binding motifs RGD, LDV and NGR are present in astrovirus ORF2 except for Turkey1. most of these putative integrin-binding sequences are located in VP34 rather than in the spike protein VP25. dN/dS values do not exceed 0.16, except for ORF2 in the cat and human4 isolates. the individual values of dN and dS may be more easily interpreted in a tree format than as raw data in a table. 0.0085 0.2177 0.0390 0.0143 0.3686 0.0388 0.0415 0.5710 0.0727 Human4 DQ070852 0.0068 0.2338 0.0291 0.0033 0.1517 0.0218 0.1564 0.5992 0.2610 Human5 DQ028633 0.0122 0.1390 0.0878 0.0061 0.1872 0.0326 0.0959 0.7401 0.1296 Human6 Z46658 0.0876 0.7478 0.1171 Human7 values for dN/dS exceeding 0.15 are in italics. dS trees of non-synonymous (A) and synonymous (B) substitutions in ORF1a and ORF1b. dN trees of VP34 and VP27 are nicely deep-rooted and nearly identical to the dN tree of the complete ORF2. dS values of sheep virus capsids increase from 36.5 in VP34 to 64.4 in VP27, while these values decrease from 53.3 to 12.3 in mink. the difference is even more dramatic, 60.6 in VP34 and only 4.8 in VP27. VP34, tree compression is due to high values of dS in pig, sheep, mink and turkey, similar to the results for ORF2. the sheep virus and to a lesser extent both turkey viruses are responsible for tree compression. the viral species available are mentioned in the first column and specified by their accession numbers. it cannot be excluded that even PAML encounters saturation-related problems at high rates of mutation in a proper alignment of sequences. all three ORFs display sites that tend to escape from purifying selection. posterior mean values of dN/dS for BEB-selected sites are between 1 and 1.5 in all ORFs with high standard errors and low posterior probability. sites with dN/dS values less than 0.1 constitute a large majority in ORF1a. sites with dN/dS values less than 0.1 constitute a large majority in ORF1a. in ORF2 Position in Alignment Amino acid residue Position in H1Z25771 Posterior mean value for dN/dS SE for dN/dS Posterior probability (dN/dS > 1) 489 A 440 1.231 0.418 0.660 507 D 458 1.182 0.439 0.611 533 V 472 1.123 0.457 0.551 537 L 476 1.282 0.396 0.717 604 S amino acid in the alignment has been converted into the location in the H1Z25771 polyprotein. for each site, the BEB-derived value of dN/dS (Y-axis) is plotted against the position of the residue in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF (X-axis) dN/dS distribution in ORF1b illustrates power of purifying selection even more dramatically. dN/dS distribution in the conserved polymerase domain has dN/dS values far below 0.25 to 0.3. VP25/27 encoded by the C-terminal part of ORF2 constitutes the virus' spike protein and carries the region of serotypic antibody recognition (580\u2013606) dN/dS values tend to increase towards neutral evolution. dN/dS value of 1.441 0.264 and a posterior probability of 0.901. integrin binding can also be fulfilled by similar motifs, for example KGD, RHD, NGR and LDV. most of these putative integrin-binding sequences are located in VP34 rather than in the spike protein VP25. the presence of the RDG consensus sequence in human astrovirus serotype 1 was revealed by means of PROSITE. other putative sequence motifs were traced by text-editing. experimental support is absent. substitution models subjected to maximum likelihood approximation tolerate significantly higher levels of mutational saturation than \"classic\" substitution models relying on the Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits at the same site. the tree based on synonymous substitutions is very much standard-like, whereas the tree based on synonymous substitutions clearly suffers from compression. RNAs of avian nephritis virus have been prepared from cell-culture supernatants after three consecutive rounds of plaque purification. adaptation of human astroviruses to grow in continuous cell lines induces a 45-nucleotide deletion near the 3'-end of ORF1a. astrovirus protease, polymerase and VP34 are exemplary for this process of negative selection. borders of VP25 may mark adaptive responses to maintain the structure of the virus spike protein. the range of neutral evolution (0.3 dN/dS 1) is not very popular in astrovirus ORFs. astrovirus has reached equilibrium between purifying selection and molecular adaptation. a novel strategy was developed to obtain properly aligned astrovirus sequences. we included one specimen per human serotype except for human serotype 1. the human virus species Z25771 differs from L23513 (and from the other astrovirus species as well) the PAL2NAL program was used for the conversion of a sequence alignment of proteins into the corresponding codon-based nucleotide alignment [38] that in turn was used for input into the CODEML module of PAML3.14 [11]. the parameter-richness of the substitution model was effectively reduced by choosing F3x4 for CodonFreq and by attaching foreground labels to tip branches of the input tree. phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML) Sequences of astroviruses were obtained from GenBank. recently obtained sequences of mink and human serotypes 4 and 5 [34] were also included in the present study. the number of complete ORF2 sequences surpasses those of ORF1a or ORF1b. the PAL2NAL program was used for the conversion of a sequence alignment of proteins into the corresponding codon-based nucleotide alignment [38]. PAL2NAL takes only a few seconds to convert a collection of nucleotide sequences into a multiple sequence alignment of codons corresponding to the parent amino acid alignment. a single charge of 200 PAML iterations takes 4 to 24 hours of calculation on a P4/2.8 GHz."}
