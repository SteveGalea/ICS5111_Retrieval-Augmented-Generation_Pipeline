{"summary": "allergen-provoked mast cells trigger release of allergic inflammatory mediators including histamine via degranulation. natural herbs, with improved safety profiles and immune-regulatory effects, have been suggested as alternative therapeutics. herb-derived extracts of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum), beefsteak plant (Perilla frutescens), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and skullcap (Scutellariae baicalensis) suppress inflammation by regulating immune function in antigen-activated macrophages. these 9 extracts were mixed to produce an effective treatment for allergic disorders after verifying their efficacy. the mixture was named nona natural product mixture (NPM-9) and has been patented in Korea. samples of each product (100 g) were reflux extracted twice in 1 L 70% ethanol using a Soxwave100 apparatus. concentrations were lyophilized, yielding a dried powder. a solvent control group was exposed to acetone and isopropyl myristate. each treatment was performed on days 9\u201315. body weight and water intake were measured daily. Sensitization with OVA and Preparation of Splenocyte Cultures Mice were sensitized with 20 g OVA (Grade VI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) adsorbed in 2 mg/mL Imject Alum i.p. injection on days 7 and 21. blood samples were obtained from the brachial plexus. splenocytes were prepared from each mouse. splenocytes were prepared from each mouse. pooled sera from nonssensitized and sensitized mice were included as negative and positive controls. the levels were determined using biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgE. the 4-week-old mice were housed in an air-conditioned room (23 2\u00b0C) with a 12 h light/dark cycle. they were allowed free access to food and tap water. mice were sensitized with 50 L of 5% TMA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in solvent on day 5. challenges with 10 L of 5% TMA in solvent on the dorsum of both ears were performed. each treatment was performed on days 9\u201315. mice were divided into nave, sham (TMA), NPM-9 (250 mg/kg BW) and prednisolone groups (30 mg/kg BW). ear thickness measured by histological analysis (H&E staining) mice were sensitized with 20 g OVA adsorbed in 2 mg/mL Imject Alum i.p. injection. the solvent control group was administered saline and 2.5% ethanol. in the treatment groups, 250 mg/kg NPM-9 was administered orally. IgE capture antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA) or OVA (10 g/mL dissolved in 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), pH 8.2) were pipetted into 96-microwell plates. plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and carefully washed 3 times with washing buffer. samples were incubated for another 30 min in the dark. the reaction was terminated by addition of stop solution. the IC50 value of IL-4 was calculated from the reduction of IL-4 by different concentrations of test substance using linear regression analysis. body weight of NPM-9 group did not differ from that of sham or prednisolone group. orally administered NPM-9 (250 mg/kg) daily for 14 days. serum IgE levels in TMA-treated CHS mice were higher than in nontreated mice. PM-9 administration suppresses early-phase Th2 skewing, prohibiting development of chronic inflammation. oral administration of NPM-9 reduced the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-1 in inflamed ear tissue but not IL-4. splenocytes cultured with NPM-9 produced IL-4 levels 1.6- to 16-fold lower than each extract alone. each extract produced an antiallergic effect by inhibiting IL-4 production. the effect of NPM-9 on IFN- production in both Th1 and Th2-dependent chronic skin inflammation requires further study. IC50 of IFN- and IL-4 were quantified by ELISA after cells were cultured for 72 h with splenocytes from OVA-induced allergic mice. IL-4 is the major inducer of class switching of Ig to B lymphocyte IgE biosynthesis associated with allergic responses. IL-4 was suppressed in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated versus the untreated group. but IL-10 secretion was not enhanced by NPM-9 treatment. the effect of NPM-9 on IL-12 and IL-10 is interesting in macrophages. oral administration of NPM-9 (250 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks had no adverse effects in mice. safety and immunomodulatory effects of NPM-9 may result from the interaction of active ingredient in each extract. 5% TMA challenge on days 0 and 5 and subsequent low-dose challenges with 2% TMA for 10 days induced a significant increase in ear thickness. we also observed the body weight of each mouse in days 520 on Th2-mediated skin allergic inflammation to examine toxicity or side effect of NPM-9. as a result, body weight of each mouse did not differ from that of sham or prednisolone group. values are presented as mean SD (n = 4 per group) data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Student's t test. it is possible that NPM-9 had not yet induced Th2 migration to the inflamed regions. the effect of NPM-9 on IFN- production in both Th1-s and Th2-dependent chronic skin inflammation requires further study. the effect of NPM-9 on IFN- production in both Th1-s and Th2-dependent chronic skin inflammation requires further study. IC50 of IL-4 and IL-4 were quantified by ELISA after cells were cultured for 72 h with splenocytes from OVA-induced allergic mice. IL-4 is the major inducer of class switching of Ig to B lymphocyte IgE biosynthesis associated with allergic responses. splenocyte levels of IL-4 and IL-12 were greater in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated OVA-stimulated mice than in untreated mice. IL-4 was suppressed in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated versus the untreated group. alkylamides and piperine in black pepper have immunomodulatory activities. flavonoids such as curcumin and catechin have immunomodulatory activities. glycyrrhizin enhances LPS-induced IL-12 production."}
