{"summary": "PCVs are members of the Circovirus genus of the Circoviridae family. there are three species in the genus, PCV type 1 (PCV1), PCV type 2 (PCV2), and PCV type 3 (PCV3). PCV1 is apathogenic in pigs (2). in 2007, a new disease called hemorrhagic diathesis broke out in calves in Germany. PCV2b (1,767 bp) was suggested as a potential causal pathogen. in the united states and china, PCV2 was frequently detected using metagenomic sequencing method and special PCR method in beef from supermarkets, beef stalls, and goat samples. ruminants, especially cattle, are noteworthy reservoirs of PCVs. ruminants, particularly cattle, are noteworthy reservoirs of PCVs. ruminants are more of a carrying reservoir and an animal model of PCVs. PCV2 was also reported in minks, foxes, and raccoon dogs with diarrhea or reproductive failure in china. infection of PCV2 in fur animals may be caused by consumption of food containing porcine-origin products and possibly by cross-species transmission. positive samples were localized to Limfjord in the northern part of Jutland and a bay area in the south-western part of Jutland, Denmark. this suggested that these bay areas were contaminated by porcine waste. PCV2 may be a specific indicator of porcine waste in shellfish. 74 out of 213 clinically healthy bovine samples were positive for PCV3. the bovine-origin PCV3 genome sequences had a close relationship with porcine-origin PCV3 genome sequences. ruminants, especially cattle, are noteworthy reservoirs of PCVs. rodent-origin PCV2 genome sequences had remarkable similarity with gene sequences of PCV2 isolated from pigs (37, 39) one recent study identified PCV3 in commercially sourced laboratory mice including BALB/c and ICR mice (40) this is in contrast with from the Hungarian study, which claims that rodents need certain contact with pigs. PCV3 was first identified in ticks (Ixodes ricinus) collected from wild roe deers that were negative for PCV3, making the source of PCV3 ambiguous. PCVs in Mussels Bivalve shellfishes intake nutrition by filtering up to 4.8 L/h of surrounding water. antibody of PCV1 or antigen of PCV2 was detected in human sera, digestive tract samples and respiratory tract samples (60\u201365). despite serological and molecular proof of PCV presence in humans, the detection rate is very low. the clinical significance of PCVs in human beings remains largely unknown. PCV2 was detected in nasal washes of workers (4/78) from pig farms. this revealed that PCV2 was a potential airborne virus. intriguingly, PCV2 can be detected in various types of water samples from Brazil. ruminants hardly ingest porcine products or have rare or no contact with pigs. there is a high risk of infection in ruminants via PCV-contaminated water. PCVs could exist in almost all tissues of pigs and wild boars."}
