{"summary": "pneumonia infected recruit trainees most frequently. only 12% of HAdV pneumonia patients showed leukocytosis. most patients were cured without complication, but some progressed. adenovirus-related CAP was recently ranked in the top 10 etiologies of CAP by larger studies. HAdV pneumonia in immunocompetent individuals and risk factors of disease progression to severe pneumonia have not been well studied. pneumonia was defined by acute respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain) and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans. patients diagnosed with other pulmonary diseases were excluded. we performed multiplex PCR for the respiratory bacterial pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis. the genotype of each isolate was determined according to the serotype of the highest scoring strain in Genbank. in south Korea, military service is mandatory for all healthy men 18 years old. trainees spend 6 weeks on basic military training, then proceed to advanced training centers or active duty. all military trainees or active duty members, but not officers, were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 years old. multiplex real-time PCR We performed multiplex PCR for human respiratory viruses using the AdvanSureTM RV real-time PCR Kit. this assay targets 12 types of pathogenic RNA viruses: rhinoviruses A/B/C, influenza viruses A/B, coronaviruses 229E/NL63/OC43, respiratory syncytial viruses A/B, parainfluenza viruses 1/2/3, and metapneumovirus. all analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows ver. 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) Results Baseline characteristics Of 210 eligible patients, 199 were enrolled. two patients refused enrollment, nine others had tuberculosis (n = 4), acute eosinophilic pneumonia (n = 4), or toxocariasis (n = 1). Eight cases were excluded because of missing sputum samples.

HAdV-7 is in the same species group as HAdV-55 (HAdV-7/11/14/55 are in species group B) patients with HAdV pneumonia had higher and longer fevers than previous studies. patients with HAdV pneumonia also had more upper respiratory tract symptoms than those in the negative group. most typical laboratory findings were febrile leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. the most common pattern in our study was GGO with or without septal thickness and central consolidation, a finding specific to HAdV pneumonia that was not observed with HAdV-negative pneumonia. the most common pattern in our study was GGO with or without septal thickness and central consolidation, a finding specific to HAdV-negative pneumonia that was not observed with HAdV-negative pneumonia. similar results were observed in pandemic H1N1 influenza pneumonia studies. we were uncertain of which pathogen(s) caused the outbreak and did not plan to conduct HAdV genotyping at the study outset. a respiratory virus surveillance system and epidemiological expertise are urgently needed. comparison of laboratory findings and outcomes associated with severe adenovirus pneumonia and mild to moderate adenovirus pneumonia."}
