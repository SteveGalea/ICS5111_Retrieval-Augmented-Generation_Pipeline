{"summary": "inflammasomes are critical innate immune sensors involved in maintaining the cellular health in response to cytosolic pathogens or stress signals. inflammasome complexes are assembled to process the cleavage of caspase-1, which activates proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), and a cytosolic protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) (5). the emerging importance of inflammasomes in response to viral infection points to another area for the involvement of inflammasomes (11) paradoxically, inflammasomes are essential for liver defense against pathogens and danger signals. however, excessive activation of inflammasomes promotes the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. NLRP12 Attenuate inflammation responses during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury Suppress phosphorylation of IB and ERK and increase susceptibility to Salmonella (31) (32) AIM2 Activate caspase-1 to protect hepatocytes from redox stress-induced injury. RC4 inflammasome processes the production of IL-18. exogenous administration of IL-18 is protective against the infection of C. violaceum and another liver-tropic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. inflammasomes are also implicated in the activation of caspase-11. inflammasomes have a prominent role in defense against hepatitis virus infections. mice deficient in caspase-1/11 are more susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus infection. inflammasome-dependent cytokine, IL-18, is required for host defense against MHV. inflammasome-mediated hepatocellular protection against oxidative stress Oxidative stress induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) has emerged as a hallmark of liver injury (53). nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are released into the cytosol which act as DAMPs to activate innate immunity (54) inflammasomes are critical regulators in suppressing hepatic lipid deposition. mice deficient in NLRP1 spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. NLRP1MUT mice are devoid of lipid vacuoles in the liver. NLRP6/ mice can be transferred to co-housed wide type (WT) mice. exposure to HFD or MCDD alters the gut microbiota composition and function. NLRP6 inflammasome is recognized as a potent modulator for maintaining gut homeostasis (63) innate immunity circulation between NLRP3 inflammasome in kupffer cell- and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NLRP3 inflammasome also induces caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis to control the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. NLRP3 inflammasome is shown to defense against bacterial and parasitic infections. IL-18 therapy does not fully reduce bacterial burdens to the normal level. inflammasomes are also identified to control parasitic infections. lack of IL-1 in caspase-1/11-deficient mice is accompanied by downregulated hepatic interleukin-17+CD8+. inflammasome-dependent cytokine, IL-18, is required for host defense against MHV. IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) deficiency reduces production of IFN- by activated T cells. monocytes can detect HCV-infected hepatocytes and respond by secreting IL-18 in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner, which subsequently stimulates NK cell-derived IFN- causing suppression on HCV. dative stress induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) has emerged as a hallmark of liver injury (53). nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are released into the cytosol which act as DAMPs to activate innate immunity (54) inflammasomes have a broader role in protecting hepatocytes from oxidative stress-induced injury. inflammasomes are critical regulators in suppressing hepatic lipid deposition. mice deficient in NLRP1 spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. NLRP1MUT mice are devoid of lipid vacuoles in the liver. NLRP6 inflammasome is recognized as a potent modulator for maintaining gut homeostasis. one group of microbial-derived metabolites triggers the activation of NLRP6-caspase-1 axis. IL-18 upregulates interleukin-22 signaling to promote wound healing. NLRP3 inflammasome also induces caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis to control proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. downregulated expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in HCC tissues correlate with the aggravation of carcinoma. reconstitution of NLRP3 inflammasome dramatically reverses the malignant phenotype of HCC. one type of miRNA, miR-148a, has recently been demonstrated to suppress pyroptosis in ALD (70) the hepatocyte specific expression of miR-148a directly inhibits the interaction between thioredoxin-interacting protein and NLRP3 leading to attenuated pyroptosis and decreased incidence of ALD (70). the trigger that initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome remains to be determined. autophagy causes dysfunctional mitochondria and increased production of ROS. induction of autophagy by ezetimibe dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activity. in the liver, expression of NLRP3 inflammasome is upregulated and responsible for pathogenesis of NASH, but downregulated in the gut. a strong correlation is demonstrated between levels of IL-1 and severity of liver inflammation in HBV patients. NLRP3 inflammasome is also identified in HCV infection by the observation of an upregulated expression of NLRP3 signaling pathway in monocytes and macrophages with HCV. kupffer cell has been identified as the primary cell source of IL-1 in chronic HCV patients. REO activates NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the occurrence of pyroptosis and secretion of IL-1 in kupffer cells. a small peptide RE-1 inhibits NLRP3 activation via reducing ROS generation and calcium influx. these studies implicate the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in nanoparticle-induced liver injury. IL-1 promotes differentiation of Th17 cells to secret interleukin-17 (IL-17) a critical proinflammatory cytokine in amplifying inflammation responses and perpetuating liver fibrosis. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway appears to be central to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. the hepatocyte specific expression of miR-148a by lentivirus delivery directly inhibits the interaction between thioredoxin-interacting protein and NLRP3 leading to attenuated pyroptosis. the trigger that initiates the activation of NLRP3 remains to be determined. the hepatocellular damage is associated with toxic effects induced by accumulated lipids. induction of autophagy dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activity and ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation on MCD (82) all these findings imply the beneficial role of autophagy in NASH via the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 deficiency leads to increased bacteremia and aggravated NASH (15) NLRP3 inflammasome is also identified in HCV infection by the observation of an upregulated expression of NLRP3 signaling pathway. kupffer cell has been identified as the primary cell source of IL-1 in chronic HCV patients. NLRP3 inflammasome stimulates lipid droplet formation in hepatocytes, which promotes the morphogenesis and replication of HCV. coating REO with a small peptide RE-1 inhibits NLRP3 activation via reducing ROS generation and calcium influx. the sustained activation of NLRP3 in response to REO is mediated by lysosomal damage and massive release of cathepsin B (24) these studies implicate the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in nanoparticle-induced liver injury. IL-1 promotes differentiation of Th17 cells to secret interleukin-17. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway appears to be central to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. uncovered link may open avenues for novel therapeutics for liver fibrosis. the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in response to HCV infection requires the recognition by toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. NLRP3 inflammasome cooperates with TNF- and IL-17 contributing to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis."}
