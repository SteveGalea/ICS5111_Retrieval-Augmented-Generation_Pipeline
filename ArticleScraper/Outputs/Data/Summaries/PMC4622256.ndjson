{"summary": "patients tested positive for MERS-CoV by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples at the jeddah regional laboratory during March\u2013May 2014. matched to a line list of patients tested that included cycle threshold (Ct) values for the upstream of the envelope E (upE) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a targets Specimens were stored at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C and transported to the jeddah Regional Laboratory within 48 hours after collection. total nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens was performed by using the MagNA Pure LC 96 or the MagNA Pure Compact (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) both instruments were programmed for the DNA_Blood_100_400_V3_2 protocol (Roche) with a 200-L sample volume and 100-L el Ct values were used as a relative indicator of virus load. lower Ct values were considered to reflect higher virus load than higher Ct values. nasopharyngeal specimens can be lower (i.e., higher virus load) than upper respiratory tract samples. values were grouped into high virus load (Ct26), medium virus load (Ct 27\u201333) and low virus load (Ct34) values for categorical analysis. groups were compared using the 2 test (Brett Whittaker, pers. comm. on grouping of Ct values) nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples were matched to a line list of patients with the most complete clinical and outcome data. a composite of patients tested included cycle threshold (Ct) values for the upstream of the envelope E (upE) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a targets. imens were stored at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C and transported to the jeddah Regional Laboratory within 48 hours after collection. both instruments were programmed for the DNA_Blood_100_400_V3_2 protocol (Roche) both instruments were programmed for the DNA_Blood_100_400_V3_2 protocol (Roche) with a 200-L sample volume and 100-L elution volume. Ct values were used as a relative indicator of virus load. lower Ct values were considered to reflect higher virus load than higher Ct values. nasopharyngeal samples with the earliest date of collection were used. medium virus load (Ct 27\u201333), and low virus load (Ct34) values for categorical analysis. groups were compared by using the 2 test. a variable was considered to be a significant confounder of the Ct association. Specimens for MERS-CoV were collected in 18 facilities. 59% of specimens were collected from 4 facilities. 15 (13%) specimens were collected at home for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic contacts. median Ct for upE target from 106 nasopharyngeal swab samples was 32.0. 102 patients with nasopharyngeal swab samples and known outcome status were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, p0.0001. of these 102 patients, 41 (40%) died. the Ct values for the upE target for 41 patients who died were significantly lower than those for 61 patients who survived. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.0087. patients who survived, symptomatic (n = 30) versus mildly symptomatic/asymptomatic (n = 31) n = 36 8 (22) 21 (58) 7 (19) 0.018 General ward, n = 31 2 (6) 16 (52) 13 (42) Symptom status Symptomatic, n = 30 2 (7) 18 (60) 10 (33) 0.064 Asymptomatic, n = 30 0 14 (47) 16 (53) *Ct, cycle threshold; ICU, intensive care unit; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. in univariate logistic regression, increased probability of death was predicted by older age, presence of underlying illness, and lower Ct. lower Ct values remained predictive of death when adjusted for age and presence of underlying illness. 1 point decrease in Ct 1.18 (1.06\u20131.33) 1.17 (1.01\u20131.35) 1.20 (1.06\u20131.35) 1.16 (1.00\u20131.34) Age, y, grouped in quartiles 8\u201328, n = 23 Referent Referent Referent 29\u201347, n = 21 2.67 (0.57\u201312.4) 2.79 (0.49\u201315.8) 4.10 (0.92\u201318.4) 5.21 (0.88\u201330.9) 48\u201360, n = n = 36 0.27 (0.07\u20131.07) NA 0.32 (0.08\u20131.26) NA May 6\u201316, n = 9 0.57 (0.10\u20133.3) NA *ORs for Ct for upE target are the odds of having outcome for each 1 point decrease in Ct. Ct, cycle threshold; ICU, intensive care unit; MERS-CoV; NA, not included in multivariate model; OR, odds ratio. higher virus loads of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were associated with greater severity of illness among Chinese children (16) higher virus loads of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were associated with greater severity of illness among Chinese children (16) implication of measuring virus load in upper respiratory tract specimens for MERS-CoV is not clear because the virus load probably reflects virus replication in the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. we assumed that virus load in the upper respiratory tract correlated with that in the lung, although this assumption is not known definitively. specimens were collected from multiple hospitals and the home setting for asymptomatic contacts. this could have led to variability in quality of the specimens, and/or handling and shipping practices in getting specimens to the Jeddah Regional Laboratory. if systematic differences were present by site, this variability should have been nondifferential and biased the findings toward the null."}
