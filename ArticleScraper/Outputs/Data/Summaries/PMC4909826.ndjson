{"summary": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypic autoimmune complex disease. it is characterized by excessive production of autoantibodies against a broad range of self-antigens. lupus nephritis remains a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) TNF- 308 G > A (rs1800629) is located on chromosome 6p21.3, within the class III region of MHC. the TNF- 308 A allele has been reported to be a stronger transcriptional activator in vitro than the common G allele. the aim of this study is to investigate the association between TNF- 308 G > A and IFN- + 874 A > T gene polymorphisms with the SLE susceptibility and severity among Egyptian subjects. subjects were recruited from the Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. PCR amplification was carried out using veriti\u00ae thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) in a 20 l total volume containing about 100 ng of genomic DNA template. primer sequences for INF- were as follows: reverse primer: 5\u2032-TCA ACA AAG CTG ATA CTC CA-3\u2032, INF- A forward primer: 5\u2032-TTC TTA CAA AAA ATC AAA TCA-3\u2032, INF- A. PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, 10 cycles of incubation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 62 \u00b0C for 50 s and 72 \u00b0C for 40 s. the amplified PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining followed by ultraviolet visualization. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the statistical package of social science (SPSS, version 17.0) software program. the frequencies of studied genotypic and allelic polymorphisms among cases were compared to those of controls using Fisher's exact test and odds ratio (OR) PCR conditions were carried out in a thermocycler at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min. primer sequences for INF- were as follows: reverse primer: 5\u2032-TCA ACA AAG CTG ATA CTC CA-3\u2032, INF- T forward primer: 5\u2032-TTC TTA CAA CAC AAA ATC AAA TCA-3\u2032. the genotypes of IFN- + 874 A > T; lane M indicate DNA Ladder 100 bp, lanes (1 and 2) represent genotype GA, lanes (3 and 4) represent genotype GA, lanes (7 and 8) represent genotype GA, lanes (9 and 10) represent genotype GA, TNF- 308. cases showed a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFNG- + 874 (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls. TNF 308 G > A SLE % (n = 125) Controls % (n = 112) Genotypes GG 92 (73.6) 98 (87.5) GA 28 (22.4) 13 (11.6) AA 5 (4.0) 1 (0.9) HWE 2 = 2.15, p > 0.05 2 = 0.66.
