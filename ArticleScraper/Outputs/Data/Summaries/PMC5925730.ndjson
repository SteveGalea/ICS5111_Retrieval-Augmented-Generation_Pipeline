{"summary": "the vesivirus genus is the now eradicated vesicular exanthema of swine virus that emerged in the u.s. in the 1930s. the ability of the marine-origin vesiviruses to cross species boundaries is a hallmark of the genus (2). two additional strains, Geel and Allston, were subsequently discovered in production facilities in Belgium and the united states (15) the CHO cell isolates are all closely related and often collectively referred to as vesivirus strain 2117. this virus is a continuing concern for the biopharmaceutical industry. canine circovirus (CCV) testing was performed by a commercial diagnostic service. minerals analysis, toxicology, and immunofluorescence assays were performed for CCV, canine adenovirus (CAdV) and canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) the body of dog 4 was submitted to WRAHL for complete necropsy and diagnostic evaluation. FFPE tissue sections of the brain, heart, trachea, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder, tongue, stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, lymph nodes, eyelids, thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and bone marrow were examined. homogenates were overlaid on semiconfluent monolayers of an immortalized canine kidney cell line, CK-DE2 (AHDC, Cornell University) the homogenate was allowed to remain on the monolayer for 1 to 3 h and then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. cells were subcultured using trypsin at 5- to 7-day intervals, and new monolayers were established at a 1:6 split ratio. three primer sets were used: 3461F/3553R and 3443F/3553R targeting open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and 5750F/5823R beginning in the 3\u2032 end of ORF1 and spanning the ORF1/ORF2 junction. nucleic acids from unfixed specimens were extracted using a Qiagen viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) first-strand cDNA was synthesized using superScript IV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) overlapping primer sets for amplification and sequencing were designed using alignments of previously published 2117 virus sequences and newly generated CU-296 sequence. sequences were generated with a Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity 2 master mix (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) gene termini of CU-296 were determined using a RACE system kit (Life Technologies) BLAST analysis was conducted at GenBank, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide. sequences were aligned with ClustalW (20), phylogeny was analyzed. phylogeny was analyzed using the neighbor-joining method (21) plasma cells and B lymphocytes were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-human CD20 (PA5-16701; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and a mouse monoclonal IgG1, Pax-5 (1EW) directed at a transcription factor for B-lymphocyte development. T lymphocytes were labeled with the mouse monoclonal IgG2a, clone LN10 (PA0553 a novel 20 Z pair probe (ACD, catalog no. 472281) was designed to prevent nonspecific hybridization to canine genomic sequences. a potential to hybridize to FCV and related vesiviruses is recognized since there are regions of 67 to 74% similarity over approximately 40% of the sequence submitted for probe design. the capsid gene sequences of strains 143, CU-47, CU-103, and LSU 96-6931 are entered in GenBank under accession number MG213713 to MG213716. the accession numbers of related vesiviruses used in the analysis were as follows: allston/08 and allston/09 (GQ475301, GQ475302), bari/212/07/ITA (JN204722), Geel FFPE tissue samples from dogs 1 to 3 were obtained at necropsy. the body of dog 4 was submitted to WRAHL for complete necropsy and diagnostic evaluation. a board-certified veterinary pathologist (G.E.D.) used routine histopathology, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and a novel and highly sensitive CaVV-specific ISH assay. a total of 10 samples of the brain, lung, liver, small intestine, and colon obtained from dog 4 were performed at the AHDC. one 75-cm2 flask of infected CK-DE2 cells was frozen at 80\u00b0C. the culture was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Virus was resuspended in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for negative staining transmission electron microscopy. ous control reactions were run after the addition of a MS2 phage standard to the extraction buffer used with all specimens. single-tube reactions used a PATH ID multiplex one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) stepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems) with cycling conditions of 48\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. genome termini of CU-296 were determined using a RACE system kit (Life Technologies) full-length ORF2 capsid genes were amplified and sequenced from archival strain 143. two field strains amplified from fecal samples (CU-47 and CU-103) and isolate LSU 96-6931 (Louisiana State University) from dog 2, lung from dog 3 and all tissues from dog 4 were sectioned at a 5-m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) the presence of immune and inflammatory cells in sections of the brain was assessed by IHC analysis. sections of tissue were processed for heat epitope retrieval and incubated with the respective primary antibodies for 10 to 30 min at room temperature. s, circulating and emigrated neutrophils, monocytes, and a subset of reactive tissue macrophages were labeled with the mouse monoclonal IgG1, clone MAC387 (M0747; DakoCytomation), anti-human myeloid/histiocyte antigen. activated macrophages and dendritic cells were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a conserved human cross-reactivity to other vesiviruses would need to be determined empirically, although nonspecific signal would likely be weak. ISH probes included a bacterial gene Dap-B and ubiquitin C. 11 dogs at a kennel in the washington, DC, metropolitan area presented with acute signs of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. seven dogs were sufficiently stable to be released following routine outpatient medical management or less than 48 h of hospitalization. four dogs rapidly decompensated over the course of 24 to 72 h and died (n = 1) or were euthanized due to poor prognosis. diagnostic specimens from five of the eleven affected dogs were submitted for a GI PCR panel with results of three negative (two deceased, one survivor), one Giardia positive (survivor), one CCoV positive (survivor), and three dogs positive (one deceased, two survivors) by fecal culture for coliforms, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. no two dogs with the same clinical signs tested positive for the same disease or the clinical signs of the more severely affected dogs did not match the diagnosis of the lesser affected dogs. only tissue from the survivors were available for further testing. multifocal acute hemorrhage also was present in the heart, the cortex of the adrenal gland, and mucosa of the urinary bladder. the lung of dog 4 had a locally extensive aspiration pneumonia and a section of lymph node had acute sinus hemorrhage similar to that seen in dog 2. small intestine, dog 1: fibrinoid necrosis of arterial blood vessel walls (arrowheads) at the junction of acute superficial mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage (H&E stain; scale bar, 170 m). small intestine, dog 2: CaVV nucleic acid signal in endothelial cells of arterial blood vessels (arrowheads) at the junction between the lamina propria and submucosa. CK-DE2 cells inoculated with tissue homogenate from dog 4 showed complete disruption of the cell monolayer within 3 days postinoculation. the virus was also cultured on an immortalized canine skin cell line. two new strains identified and designated CU-47 and CU-103. both were from dogs of undetermined health status. attempts to propagate lyophilized strain 143 and fecal strains CU-47 and CU-103 were unsuccessful. v at aa 99 is the only amino acid in the ORF1 polyprotein that is unique to CU-296 compared to the group of 2117-like viruses. high variation in the VP1 capsid is a hallmark of vesiviruses with highest diversity in the carboxy-terminal third corresponding to the vesiviruses. the highest identities to CU-296 are indicated in boldface. the highest identities to CU-296 are indicated in boldface. the highest identities to CU-296 are indicated in boldface. b Vesivirus strains were aligned to FCV CFI/68 (AAC13993.1) regions with amino acid boundaries as defined by Neill (29). most FFPE tissues tested from dogs 1, 2, and 3 were positive with all three assays. kidney tissues from dog 1 and pancreas tissues from dog 2 were negative. lung tissues from dog 2 and kidney tissues from dog 3 were positive. all sections of the small intestines from dogs 1, 2, and 4 and of the brain from dog 4 showed prominent CaVV nucleic acids in the endothelial cells of arterioles, small and large arteries, and capillary vessels. scattered mononuclear cells within the subcapsular sinuses and the cortex of lymph nodes taken from dogs 2 and 4 showed the least amount of CaVV nucleic acids. ISH of a small intestinal section from dog 1 with control probes Dap-B and CI-UBC showed negative and positive reactivity. in the kidney, large arteries, and interstitial capillaries, primarily at the junction between the cortex and medulla, showed strong hybridization signal. y diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, severe profuse hematochezia, depression, obtunded, nystagmus and seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest; euthanized 8/5/2015. diagnostic specimens from five of the eleven affected dogs were submitted for a GI PCR panel. all chemistry panels (eight of eleven) were relatively within normal limits. three of the four dogs that died had partial thromboplastin and prothrombin time testing on presentation. one survivor with an elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase level (25 U/liter) areas of mucosal necrosis with frequent fibrinoid necrosis were noted. section of lymph node from dog 2 also showed acute sinus hemorrhage with erythrophagocytosis and edema. only tissue from dog 3 that was available for further examination was a section of lung. immunoreactivity admixed with macrophages with membrane and cytoplasmic Iba-1 and CD204 immunoreactivity. sections of brain from dog 4 also showed extensive capillary endothelial swelling with prominent fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles, mild perivascular hemorrhage. on the basis of these findings, a viral etiology was suspected, and this prompted further diagnostic investigation. CK-DE2 cells inoculated with tissue homogenate showed complete disruption of cell monolayer within 3 days postinoculation. virus cultured on immortalized canine skin cell line. TEM identified a calicivirus in pelleted cell lysates. a BLAST search of the sequences identified a 2117-like vesivirus. the same primer sets generated amplicons from strain 143 and LSU 96-6931. aa, and a minor structural protein (VP2) of 134 aa are conserved in CU-296 (14) the translation products of CU-296 and bari/212/07/ITA showed a high degree of conservation for ORFs 1 and 3. the ORF1 polyprotein sequence was compared to the only other full-length canine-origin 2117-like sequence, Bari/212/07/ITA. none of the pairwise identities are higher than between CU-296 and LSU 96-6931. phylogenetic relationships between capsid proteins of canine origin CaVV and related 2117 strains are depicted.

ISH of a small intestinal section from dog 1 with control probes Dap-B and CI-UBC confirmed the specificity of the CaVV probe. a focal outbreak of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred over a period of several weeks in a well-managed, high-volume, pet boarding facility in a major metropolitan area. the suspicion of a viral cause and no known etiology that could result in mortality within 24 h of onset of clinical signs led to an expanded search for an unknown pathogen. rare neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum, occasional mononuclear cells in the lamina propria of the intestine, red pulp of the spleen, sinus and cortex of the lymph node, and bone marrow. vsFCV epizootics support the suggestion of a hypervirulent variant CaVV as the cause of this disease outbreak. systemic infection is common to both vsFCV and CU-296. but there are clear distinctions in the clinical profiles. vsFCV and CU-296 target endothelial cells. alic acid (41), reveals significant differences in the P2 binding domains. it is also possible that the capsid sequence is not the most important genetic determinant of the hypervirulent systemic phenotype. most recently, antibodies to 2117-like strains have been confirmed in 21.5% of domestic dogs. strain 143 was isolated from the brain tissue of a dog with meningoencephalitis in 1996. it was identified as a calicivirus-like virus by TEM at the time. a conclusive determination will require reproduction of the disease syndrome in pathogen-free dogs."}
