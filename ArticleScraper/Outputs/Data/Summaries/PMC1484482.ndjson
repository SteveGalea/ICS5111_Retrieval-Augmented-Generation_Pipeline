{"summary": "real-time quantitative PCR can be a very powerful and accurate technique to examine gene transcription patterns in different biological conditions. real-time normalisation occurs against only one reference gene, usually GAPDH or ACTB, without validation of its expression stability. the goal of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for studies concerning normal equine skin and equine sarcoids. housekeeping genes are most widely used as reference genes, based on the assumption that they are constitutively expressed in most tissues and under certain circumstances. however, it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of these genes may vary considerably in different tissues, different cell types and different disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease. affected horses show genetic predisposition for the development of equine sarcoids. bovine papillomavirus plays an important role in the aetiology of equine sarcoids. a well suited internal control should first of all be established. the sequencing of UBB revealed 1 gap and 3 SNPs compared to the original sequence (98% identity) the gap is probably due to sequencing errors; the SNPs did not result in an amino acid variation. ACTB, B2M, GAPDH and TBP were found to be best endogenous control genes for real-time qPCR of lamella in the hoof of horses. ACTB and B2M were found to be the best endogenous control genes for real-time qPCR of lamella. in all 3 cases, the inclusion of a 4th gene had no significant contribution (low V3/4 value) to the NF. the described set of reference genes can be used in gene expression studies in normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both. real-time PCR products were visualised by gelelectrophoresis. for every assay, a single amplicon with the expected size was generated without primer dimer formation. formation of primer dimers and unspecific amplification is a major point of attention. geNorm analysis The gene expression stability over the different samples was analysed using the geNorm software. the ranking of the 6 candidate reference genes according to their M value was not equivalent between the normal skin samples, the equine sarcoid samples and the combination of both types of samples. ACTB, TUBA1 and UBB proved to be the most stable genes. reference genes chosen to calculate normalisation factor are printed in bold. the more genes included, the more accurate the NF is. however, including too many genes may increase the risk of using unsuitable genes. if cut off is made too stringent, stably expressed reference genes may be excluded. a method for genomic DNA-free RNA extraction from normal skin and equine sarcoids was optimised. a reference gene assay for reliable normalisation of real-time qPCR data was designed. a method for genomic DNA-free RNA extraction from normal skin and equine sarcoids was designed. the samples were collected from the ventral abdomen, one from the throat region and one from the shoulder. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was isolated from the samples using TRIR (ABgene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. a PCR was performed with primers for GAPDH to check for the presence of cDNA. the reaction conditions used in this PCR were identical to the minus RT control. the primers were designed by the Primer 3 software. technical information about the primers and amplicons are listed in Table 3. Information on the primers used in this study Gene Genbank accession number Primer sequence Ta (\u00b0C) Product size (bp) Primer concentration ACTB AF035774 CCAGCACGATGAAGATCAAG GTGGACAATGAGAAT 59 88 0.5 l 10 M B2M X69083 GTTCCATCCGCCTGGAGTG 60 182 0.25 l 10 M HPRT1 the initial denaturation was performed at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes. a melt curve was generated to confirm a single gene-specific peak. the pooled cDNA was obtained from normal equine skin and equine sarcoids. three sarcoids were located on the medial part of the thigh, two in the axilla and two on the ventral side of the abdomen. normal skin samples were obtained from healthy horses undergoing elective surgery or euthanasia. first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on approximately 2.6 g of the total RNA solution. a PCR was performed with random primers (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 l. the reaction conditions used in this PCR were identical to the minus RT control. the specificity of the primers was tested using a BLAST analysis against the genomic NCBI database. the complete nucleotide sequences of the genes of interest were characterised using Mfold [27] to take into account possible secondary structures at the primer binding sites which might influence the PCR efficiency. PCR reactions were performed in a 15 l reaction volume on the iCycler iQ real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using the Platinum\u00ae SYBR\u00ae Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.02 M fluorescein and 20 ng of cDNA. the initial denaturation was performed at 95\u00b0C for 20 seconds and a combined primer annealing/extension at the the geNorm Visual Basic application for Microsoft Excel was used as described by Vandesompele et al [9]. this approach relies on the principle that the expression ratio of two perfect reference genes should be identical in all samples."}
