{"summary": "human rhinoviruses were first discovered in the 1950s in an effort to identify the etiology of the common cold. nearly 60 years later, the search for a \u201ccure\u201d for the common cold virus is still ongoing. HRVs are the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infection (URI) the viral genome consists of a single gene whose translated protein is cleaved by virally encoded proteases to produce 11 proteins. four proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, make up the viral capsid that encases the RNA genome. the remaining nonstructural proteins are involved in viral genome replication and assembly. virus uptake occurs via clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis or via macropinocytosis. the virions undergo conformational changes that yield hydrophobic subviral particles. this process is initiated by ICAM-1 and/or the low-pH environment in endosomes. the development of highly sensitive molecular techniques for the identification of HRV in clinical specimens led to the identification and designation of a novel species, HRV-C. at least 50 different types of HRV-C have been identified by using a threshold of a 13% nucleotide difference in VP1 or at least 10% nucleotide difference in the VP4/VP2 region. a study of 24 married couples with one experimentally infected partner. the transmission occurred in 9 couples during contact periods ranging from 63 to 149 h (16) under experimental conditions, HRV will survive in an indoor environment for hours to days at an ambient temperature and on undisturbed skin for 2 h (17). HRV is a 7.2-kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a single open reading frame joined to a 5\u2032 untranslated region and a short viral priming protein. the P1 protein is processed to form the HRV capsid, and P2 and P3 are processed to produce VPg, protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) (6). clinical specimens in the 1960s and 1970s yielded approximately 100 different HRV strains. a limited number of complete genomes led to a division of the original 99 strains into two species: HRV-A (containing 74 serotypes) and HRV-B (containing 25 serotypes) HRV infection is efficiently initiated by intranasal and conjunctival inoculation but not by the oral route. in studies of natural and experimental HRV infection, the virus is regularly deposited onto the hands and introduced into the environment. the majority of HRV-A and -B serotypes enter airway epithelial cells via ICAM-1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. the majority of HRV-A and -B serotypes enter airway epithelial cells via ICAM-1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. HRV does disrupt epithelial cell barrier function by the dissociation of zona occludens 1 from the tight junction complex. thereby facilitating the transmigration of bacteria and exposing basolateral epithelial cell receptors such as toll-like receptors (29). et al. experimentally infected eight adult allergic volunteers with HRV-16. all subjects developed cold symptoms and had HRV-16 cultured from nasal specimens. in all subjects, HRV-16 was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the type I interferon response is mediated by melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) the engagement of these receptors maximizes HRV-induced IFN- and IFN- and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. levels of IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid specimens peaked at 48 to 72 h after virus inoculation. an interaction with TLR7/8 triggers IFN- and IFN- production and activates the NF- pathway. HRV also interacts with TLR2 on the cell surface to initiate a proinflammatory cytokine response. cytokine polymorphisms may not correlate with in vivo cytokine production in the more complex nasal mucosa and blood during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. kinins also play a role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic HRV infections. the persistence of high-titer serotype-specific antibody is associated with protection from infection as well as reduced symptom severity. there is little cross-neutralization among serotypes, which presents a challenge to vaccine development. s were classified and quantified by using monoclonal antibodies at baseline and at day 3 and day 7 following HRV inoculation. the duration of virus shedding was also inversely related to changes in lymphocyte counts. the total leukocyte count increased, likely due to an increased number of neutrophils. mice were inoculated with 5 106 50% tissue culture infective doses of minor-group HRV (HRV-1B) or major-group HRV (HRV-16) mice were inoculated with 5 106 50% tissue culture infective doses of minor-group HRV (HRV-1B) or major-group HRV (HRV-16) es played a key role in eosinophilic infiltration and airway responsiveness in HRV-infected OVA-treated versus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice. the deletion of the poly(C) tract in the distal portion (5\u2032UTR) of mengovirus causes an infection in wild-type mice that more closely resembles HRV infection of humans. obstructed smoker controls excluded from further analysis because HRV was not detected after experimental infection. three patients (2 with COPD and 1 control) were excluded from further analysis because HRV was not detected. recent studies suggest an impairment in innate immunity. CF cells produced significantly less IFN- and IFN- than normal cells. deficient IFN production was associated with reduced expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes. in cultured epithelial cells from the lower airways, HRV has not been shown to cause direct cytopathology. cytopathology has been observed by using low-confluence monolayers and high viral inocula (31), perhaps suggesting a dose-response relationship to HRV-associated lower respiratory tract infection. patients with immune dysregulation and immunosuppressive conditions are particularly predisposed. in adenoid and nasopharyngeal tissues of healthy children and adults, ICAM-1 is detected in small numbers of single nonciliated lymphoepithelial cells. however, ICAM-1 is not normally expressed on squamous epithelial cells and on the luminal surface of the ciliated epithelium. in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, HRV upregulates membrane-bound ICAM-1 expression via a NF studies showed an association between HRV infection and asthma exacerbations prompted researchers to reexamine the temperature sensitivity of HRVs. the same group demonstrated effective HRV replication in vitro using primary HBECs and in vivo in bronchial biopsy specimens of experimentally infected healthy volunteers. bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (34), interstitial pneumonitis (35; bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (34); acute and chronic inflammation with fibrinopurulent alveolar debris (36); hyperplasia and desquamation of alveolar cells. innate and adaptive host responses also have a role in the pathogenesis of HRV infection. IL-8 is mediated in part by an NF-dependent transcriptional activation pathway (42) levels of IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid specimens peaked at 48 to 72 h after virus inoculation. an interaction with TLR3 triggers the upregulation of the pattern recognition receptors in the intracellular compartment. IL-6 levels are consistently increased in nasal lavage fluid specimens in controlled studies of experimental and natural HRV infections. a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the IL-6 promoter at position 174 correlated with illness severity. cytokine polymorphisms that were not measured in in vivo studies may interact with IL-6 genotypes to influence cytokine production. symptomatic subjects show significantly increased levels of kinins in nasal lavage fluid compared to levels in sham-infected and/or healthy controls. patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia experienced more frequent and severe HRV infections than their healthy spouses despite the administration of replacement immunoglobulin therapy (54). T cells contribute to antiviral immunity through the recognition of viral antigens, which trigger both cytotoxic and antibody-mediated immune responses. human T cell clones of HRV-specific T cells are activated by serotype-specific but also shared viral epitopes. cross-reactivity among T cells may lead to more potent T cell responses and subsequent cytokine release upon reinfection with different HRV serotypes. a major focus of animal models has been to elucidate the immunology of HRV-induced asthma exacerbations. a major focus of animal models has been to elucidate the immunology of HRV-induced asthma exacerbations. experimental HRV-16 infections in patients with mild atopic asthma led to significant reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in home recordings and potentiated airway inflammation after bronchoprovocation. potential mechanisms for lower airway dysfunction following HRV infection include the direct infection of the lower airway or the stimulation of inflammatory, immunological, or neurogenic mechanisms. pulmonary alveolar macrophages from BAL fluid showed deficient IFN- and IFN- responses in COPD patients compared to controls. at baseline, 136 COPD patients had higher serum IP-10 levels than 70 age-matched controls without COPD. a recent study found no difference in levels of cytokine transcription or production in CF and control nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. however, the relative roles of the virus and the host immune response in HRV pathogenicity and symptomatic illness are still under debate. experimental HRV-16 infections in patients with mild atopic asthma and allergic subjects led to a significant reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in home recordings and potentiated airway inflammation after bronchoprovocation. potential mechanisms for lower airway dysfunction include the direct infection of the lower airway or the stimulation of inflammatory, immunological, or neurogenic mechanisms. 136 COPD patients had higher serum IP-10 levels than 70 age-matched controls without COPD. serum IP-10 levels increased significantly during HRV-positive exacerbations. sputum HRV viral loads were significantly higher during exacerbations. mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa preinfection impairs HRV clearance by suppressing the antiviral IFN response in primary HBECs. deficient IFN responses occurred via the inhibition of HRV-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and decreased levels of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation. an exaggerated inflammatory response to viral infection was also postulated to be a mechanism for virus-induced CF longitudinal studies of the epidemiology and clinical features of HRV infection in temperate climates reported a peak in incidence in the early fall, with a smaller peak in the spring (75). in general, HRVs are the most common cause of respiratory viral illness during the spring, summer, and fall months, while influenza virus and RSV predominate in the winter. 33% tested positive for HRV by real-time PCR of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. this difference in observed rates of asymptomatic HRV infection may be attributed to the higher prevalence of HRV in the youngest age groups. subjects reported nasal irritation and sore or scratchy throat at 2 and 10 h. common symptoms include rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, headache, subjective fevers, and malaise. economic impact of non-influenza virus respiratory tract infections estimated to be $40 billion annually. recurrent symptoms within 7 to 30 days after initial clinical improvement were not significantly different between those with HRV detected in MEF specimens (18%), those with RSV or coronavirus detected in MEF specimens (21%), and those with no detectable viral RNA in MEF specimens (27%). bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 66% of patients, with picornavirus accounting for two-thirds of cases. s in 50% of patients with acute community-acquired sinusitis (112) using in situ hybridization, HRV RNA was found in the maxillary sinus epithelium in 7 out of 14 adults with acute sinusitis (112). influenza A virus and RSV were more common in winter (December to February) and PIVs were found most often in winter and spring (December to April). ii) Bronchiolitis is the most common clinical manifestation of HRV infection in hospitalized children. HRV is the second most common cause of bronchiolitis in hospitalized children. litis in infancy is an independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing at 1 year of age. the risk of childhood asthma was four times higher for children with a history of HRV-associated wheezing than for children with wheezing of a different viral etiology. the severity of HRV infection in immunocompromised patients was similar to that of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. nearly 40% of patients with HRV-associated respiratory symptoms were admitted to the hospital, and 11% required ICU admission. posttransplant BOS occurred in 18% of patients with a history of respiratory viral infection and in 11.6% of patients with no such history (137). in pediatric patients, respiratory viral infection is independently associated with decreased 1-year survival rates (136). the mortality rate at 1 year following the first posttransplantation HRV infection was 55% in patients with BAL-confirmed HRV pneumonia. the mortality rate at 1 year following the first posttransplantation HRV infection was 41% in the total cohort of 63 patients. HRV is also associated with exacerbations of asthma. subjects with asthma do not have more cold illnesses than nonasthmatic individuals. however, they do experience more frequent and severe lower respiratory tract symptoms. swab, or induced sputum specimens, occurring in 36 to 50% of cases (149, 150) in the outpatient setting, approximately two-thirds of AECOPD cases are associated with common cold symptoms (increased nasal congestion and/or increased rhinorrhea) in the 18 days preceding the onset of the exacerbation. in one study, 7 out of 11 infected infants acquired HRV infection. most common symptoms were respiratory distress, apnea, rhinorrhea, and hypothermia. HRV outbreaks have been described in long-term-care facilities. in all of the above-described outbreaks, different strains of HRV were identified. 203 HCWs presenting with acute respiratory illness of a possible viral etiology were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses. overall, HRV was the most frequently detected virus (38%) a viral load higher than 107 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and patient age less than 5 years independently associated with lower respiratory tract infection. a viral load higher than 107 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and patient age less than 5 years was independently associated with lower respiratory tract infection. HRVs stimulate Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion to human tracheal epithelial cells via increases in levels of platelet-activating factor receptors (PAFRs) and to nasal epithelial cells via increased gene and protein expression levels. HRVs also promote Staphylococcus aureus internalization into non-fully permissive cultured pneumocytes. a large ecological study in Finland identified a temporal association between HRV infection in the community and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children. the mean IPD rate was only moderately increased during periods of high-versus low-level RSV activity (2.1 versus 1.7 cases per week; P = 0.008) 131 (11%) contained two or more viruses. HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detection of human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, RSV, PIV, influenza A virus, and the KI and WU polyomaviruses. HRVs are the most common cause of respiratory viral illness during the spring, summer, and fall months. influenza virus and RSV predominate in the winter. all HRV species have been identified in all months. Iwane et al. (90) detected HRV in asymptomatic children less than 5 years old recruited at well-child primary care visits in three different regions of the united states. this difference in observed rates of asymptomatic HRV infection may be attributed to higher prevalence in the youngest age groups or to environmental factors in the Alaska Native community. in a survey of 4,051 households, the economic impact of non-influenza virus respiratory tract infections was estimated to be $40 billion annually. in both experimental and natural settings, HRV is linked to otitis media (OM), which complicates approximately one-third of cold-like illnesses. bacterial-viral coinfection occurs in 66% of patients, with picornaviruses accounting for two-thirds of cases. 121 otitis-prone children tested nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR for respiratory viruses and by culture for bacterial pathogens. nose blowing, but not coughing or sneezing, generated sufficient pressure to propel nasal fluid into the paranasal sinuses. croup has occasionally been reported in children with HRV infection. HRV is the second most common clinical manifestation of bronchiolitis in hospitalized children. compared to children with RSV infection alone, a hospital length of stay of 3 or more days was less likely for children with HRV infection alone or for those with HRV-HRV coinfection. infants for wheezing found that the risk of childhood asthma was four times higher for children with a history of HRV-associated wheezing than for children with a different viral etiology (121). viral respiratory infections have been shown to induce cell damage as well as alter immune responses. as lung development begins at 4 weeks of gestation, HRV infection may have severe direct and indirect effects on lung tissues. study in the Yukon Kushkowkim Delta characterizes the etiology of lower respiratory tract-associated hospitalizations in children less than 3 years old. 33% tested positive for HRV by real-time PCR of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. this rate was not significantly different from that observed for children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract illness. compared to patients with coronavirus-associated colds, there is no difference in respiratory symptom severity or duration (96) in a survey of 4,051 U.S. households, the economic impact of non-influenza virus respiratory tract infections was estimated to be $40 billion annually. 92 children aged 3 months to 7 years with acute OM, rates of treatment failure or recurrence were not significantly different between those with HRV detected in MEF specimens (18%), those with RSV or coronavirus detected in MEF specimens (21%), and those with no detectable viral RNA in MEF specimens (27%). bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 66% of patients, with picornaviruses accounting for two-thirds of cases. HRV RNA was detected by RT-PCR of maxillary aspirate specimens and nasal swab specimens in 50% of patients with acute community-acquired sinusitis (112). using in situ hybridization, HRV RNA was found in the maxillary sinus epithelium in 7 out of 14 adults with acute sinusitis (112). in a survey of 4,051 households, the economic impact of non-influenza virus respiratory tract infections was estimated to be $40 billion annually. in both experimental and natural settings, HRV is linked to otitis media (OM), which complicates approximately one-third of cold-like illnesses in early childhood. bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 66% of patients, with picornaviruses accounting for two-thirds of cases. 121 otitis-prone children tested nasopharyngeal swabs for respiratory viruses. Gwaltney et al. measured intranasal pressure in adults during nose blowing, coughing, and sneezing. CT scans were performed after instillation of radiopaque contrast medium into the nasopharynx followed by nose blowing, coughing, and sneezing. croup has occasionally been reported in children with HRV infection. HRV is the second most common cause of bronchiolitis in hospitalized children. compared to children with RSV infection alone, a hospital length of stay of 3 or more days was less likely for those with RSV-HRV coinfection. eezing found that the risk of childhood asthma was four times higher for children with a history of HRV-associated wheezing than for children with a different viral etiology (121). viral respiratory infections have been shown to induce cell damage as well as alter immune responses. as lung development begins at 4 weeks of gestation, HRV infection may have severe direct and indirect effects on lung tissues. symptoms of croup detected HRV in 12% of cases, although rates were similar among control children with wheezing illnesses (114). croup was detected more often in samples obtained during the fall (September to November), whereas influenza A virus and RSV were more common in winter (December to February), and PIVs were found most often in winter and spring (December to April). following RSV, HRV is the second most common cause of bronchiolitis in hospitalized children. HRV-associated bronchiolitis in infancy is an independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing at 1 year of age. the risk of childhood asthma was four times higher for children with a history of HRV-associated wheezing than for children with wheezing of a different viral etiology. the severity of HRV infection in immunocompromised patients was similar to that of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. nearly 40% of patients with HRV-associated respiratory symptoms were admitted to the hospital, and 11% required ICU admission. posttransplant BOS occurred in 18% of patients with a history of respiratory viral infection and in 11.6% of patients with no such history (137). in pediatric patients, respiratory viral infection is independently associated with decreased 1-year survival rates (136). 25 HSCT recipients with pneumonia and HRV detected in BAL fluid. 10 (40%) patients had no other respiratory pathogen identified via culture or molecular methods. mortality rate at 1 year following the first posttransplantation HRV infection was 55% in patients with BAL-confirmed HRV pneumonia. in a study of 36 adult lung transplant recipients in Italy, HRV was detected in 13% of all BAL fluid specimens obtained from 15 (42%) patients. all patients were symptomatic at the time of HRV detection, including those with low viral loads of 103 to 104 RNA copies/ml. all patients had coinfection with bacterial and/or viral pathogens (134). a positive HRV sample within the last week was significantly associated with rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, postnasal drip, sputum production, and cough (139). one-third of HSCT recipients will have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of sinusitis (35). children with outpatient HRV-associated wheezing illnesses from birth to 3 years of age were 10 times more likely to have developed asthma at 6 years of age. 90% of children who wheezed with HRV in year 3 had asthma by 6 years of age. a study of 62 patients with COPD monitored for a mean of 26 months. 58% of office visits and 6% of emergency room visits were associated with respiratory viral infections. HRV was the most common respiratory viral infection, isolated in 24% of stable COPD patients and zero nonobstructed smokers. studies have examined the effects of respiratory viruses on respiratory exacerbations in CF patients. a study of 103 Brazilian children tested for respiratory viruses during routine visits or respiratory exacerbations over a 1-year period. approximately two-thirds of respiratory virus-associated asthma exacerbations are due to HRV. in a cross-sectional study of children hospitalized with asthma exacerbations and controls hospitalized with acute respiratory illnesses, HRV-C was associated with asthma exacerbations. the presence of common cold symptoms appears to be associated with prolonged recovery in patients with a moderate to severe obstruction (152). Compared to nonviral causes of AECOPD, fever is more frequent in those with documented viral infection (148, 149). 7 out of 11 infected infants acquired HRV infection during hospital stay. most common symptoms were respiratory distress, apnea, rhinorrhea, and hypothermia. HRV outbreaks have been described in long-term-care facilities. 203 HCWs presenting to the Health Care Worker Medical Assistance Service with acute respiratory illness of a possible viral etiology were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses. HRV was the most frequently detected virus (38%). sixteen of the HRV-infected HCWs, representing 77% of HRV cases, worked with high-risk patients. a viral load higher than 107 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and patient age less than 5 years independently associated with lower respiratory tract infection. a viral load higher than 107 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and patient age less than 5 years were independently associated with lower respiratory tract infection. 12% of serum specimens from hospitalized children with HRV-associated severe respiratory illness were positive for HRV viremia. a viral load higher than 107 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens was independently associated with lower respiratory tract infection. HRVs stimulate Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion to human tracheal epithelial cells via increased levels of platelet-activating factor receptors (PAFR) and to nasal epithelial cells via increased gene and protein expression levels of fibronectin, PAFR, and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (174). HRVs also promote Staphylococcus aureus internalization into non-fully permissive cultured pneum a large ecological study in Finland identified a temporal association between HRV infection in the community and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children. the mean IPD rate was only moderately increased during periods of high-versus low-level RSV activity (2.1 versus 1.7 cases per week; P = 0.008) HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detection of human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, RSV, PIV, influenza A virus, and the KI and WU polyomaviruses. a negative association was found only between HRV and influenza A virus, which has been observed in other settings. HRVs promote Staphylococcus aureus internalization into non-fully permissive cultured pneumocytes. compared to non-HRV-activated macrophages, HRV-activated macrophages demonstrate reduced levels of secretion of TNF- and IL-8 when exposed to bacterial TLRs. a large ecological study in Finland identified a temporal association between HRV infection in the community and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children. the mean IPD rate was only moderately increased during periods of high-versus low-level RSV activity (2.1 versus 1.7 cases per week; P = 0.008). authors suggest that the HRV mediation of IFN-stimulating genes may induce a protective antiviral state. a negative association was found only between HRV and influenza A virus, which has been observed in other settings. the clinical significance of virus codetection is also unknown. samples should be placed into viral transport medium. for lower respiratory tract infections, samples may include tracheal or bronchial aspirate, BAL fluid, or, less frequently, lung biopsy specimens. cultured isolates are important for studies of virus characteristics and disease pathogenesis. human fetal embryonic lung fibroblast cell lines, certain HeLa cell clones, and human embryonic kidney cell lines are most commonly used for HRV culture. EVs are relatively resistant to low pHs compared to HRV. a 2- to 3-log reduction in titers after exposure to pH 3.0 will indicate that the virus is HRV (181). rapid culture methods for the detection of infectious HRV have been described. culture method was previously validated for a very large number of HRV genotypes as well as many other respiratory viruses. over three winter seasons, 4,032 nasal aspirate specimens tested negative for HRV and other respiratory viruses by a direct fluorescence assay. multiple RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR techniques have been developed for the detection of HRV since the late 1980s. most of these assays target the 5\u2032UTR, a region highly conserved among all HRVs and EVs. RT-PCR tests can differentiate HRV from EV by amplicon size (207, 208), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (206), hybridization with HRV-specific probes (205), and real-time the most commonly used of the alternative chemistries is nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) in clinical laboratories, the most commonly used of the alternative chemistries is nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) a clinical evaluation showed a performance comparable to that of RT-PCR and a sensitivity superior to that of culture. HRVs were originally characterized by their growth patterns in human embryonic and monkey kidney cells (222, 223). however, this system demonstrated limited use, since growth characteristics changed with time in vitro (224) the importance of full-length genomic sequencing has become increasingly evident with recent studies that demonstrated HRV recombination (229, 230) the tree was calculated with neighbor-joining methods from aligned, full-genome RNA sequences and rooted with data for human enterovirus species. HRV titers are highest in the respiratory tract during the first 2 days of presentation. the virus may be isolated from 1 day before to 6 days after the onset of symptoms. nasopharyngeal swabs are preferred, with flocked swabs yielding higher virus recovery rates. antigen detection assays are not used for routine detection. antibodies are measured in both serum and nasal secretions. antibodies are not detectable for 1 to 3 weeks postinfection. authors suggested a combination of different cell lines as the best approach for the optimal recovery of HRV. early studies showed enhanced growth with incubation at 33\u00b0C rather than at 36\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C (190, 191) however, a later study demonstrated that for the majority of several serotypes, replication was enhanced only slightly by incubation at the lower temperature. rapid culture methods for the detection of infectious HRV have been described. these methods include multichamber slides with HRV-susceptible HeLa cells combined with virus antigen detection using immunofluorescence at 48 h postinfection. however, the absence of a common antigen makes the development of reliable and specific immunofluorescence reagents difficult. human fetal embryonic lung fibroblast cell lines, certain HeLa cell clones, and human embryonic kidney cell lines are most commonly used for HRV culture. inoculated cultures are maintained at a neutral pH, since HRVs are acid sensitive (183) cultures should be incubated for up to 14 days, and presumptive identification is usually made on the basis of CPE in appropriate cell lines. EVs are relatively resistant to low pHs compared to HRV, and a 2- to 3-log reduction in titers after exposure to pH 3.0 will indicate that the virus is HRV (181). rapid culture methods for the detection of infectious HRV have been described. a prospective study reported the use of a centrifugation-enhanced culture method with HuH7 cells in 48-well microplates followed by RT-PCR for HRV. this method had been previously validated for a very large number of HRV genotypes as well as many other respiratory viruses. over three winter seasons, 4,032 nasal aspirate specimens that had tested negative for respiratory viruses by a direct fluorescence assay were tested for HRV. multiple RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR techniques have been developed for the detection of HRV since the late 1980s. RT-PCR tests can differentiate HRV from EV by amplicon size (207, 208), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), hybridization with HRV-specific probes (205), RT-PCR followed by sequencing (209) and real-time RT-PCR (210) have also been reported. in clinical laboratories, the most commonly used of the alternative chemistries is nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) the most commonly used of the alternative chemistries is nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) HRVs were originally characterized by their growth patterns in human embryonic and monkey kidney cells (222, 223). this system demonstrated limited use, since growth characteristics changed with time in vitro. a subsequent classification system divided 100 HRV types into 2 groups. full-genome genomic sequences of all known human HRV serotypes, including the group C viruses, were published in 2009 (8). the importance of full-length genomic sequencing has become increasingly evident with recent studies that demonstrated HRV recombination (229, 230) the increased volume of WGS data will help identify additional genomic regions for analysis. it could help us understand what makes strains of HRV more virulent, prone to causing chronic infections, exhibit tropism for certain tissues. hybridization with HRV-specific probes (205), RT-PCR followed by sequencing (209) and real-time RT-PCR (210) have also been reported. there are currently no commercially available quantitative molecular HRV tests. however, due to the intertypic variability of HRV, there is no standard for quantification of all types. a quantitative real-time NASBA assay using molecular beacon probes was reported (216), which provides a simplified format and the additional benefit of viral load assessment. reports on its clinical evaluation have not yet been published. multiple investigators have employed PCR to amplify different genes and nontranslated regions, to further characterize HRV. three groups of HRVs are now genetically distinguished: group A, group B, and the more recently discovered group C (9). this characterization is best demonstrated by the amplification and sequence analysis of either the VP1 (91) or VP4 (208) gene. the tree was calculated with neighbor-joining methods from aligned, full-genome RNA sequences and rooted with data for human enterovirus species A, B, and C. the outer ring (\u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d) indicates anticapsid drug group types, if known. Vapendavir Capsid binder Oral Prevention of asthma exacerbations and reduction in URI symptom severity and duration Phase 2b completed Results not yet disclosed ClinicalTrials.gov Pleconaril Capsid binder Oral Treatment of natural HRV colds Phase 3 completed 1-day reduction in illness duration compared to placebo U.S. FDA licensing withheld due to safety concerns 235, 236 Pirodavir Capsid binder Intranasal spray Prevention of expt zinc unknownc Oral Prevention and treatment of natural colds in adults and children Phase 3 completed For prevention, no reduction in HRV colds; for treatment, modest reduction in symptom severity and duration. side effects include bad taste and nausea 261 Antihistamines H1 receptor inverse agonist Oral Treatment of exptl and natural HRV colds Phase 3 completed Reduced sneezing and rhinorrhea with no change in total symptom severity scores Use limited by side effects of dry eyes, the viral capsid was one of the first viral proteins targeted for the development of inhibitors of viral replication. these compounds bind to the hydrophobic pocket of the viral capsid, inducing a conformational change that increases the stability of the virion and interferes with its ability to interact with the cellular receptor. Pleconaril has 70% bioavailability, a long half-life, and good central nervous system penetration. pleconaril-treated subjects experienced a 1-day reduction in the duration of illness (7.3 days versus 6.3 days; P 0.001) compared to the placebo group (235). pleconaril-treated subjects infected with more highly susceptible viruses experienced a greater reduction in the duration of symptoms than subjects with reduced viral susceptibility (236). vapendavir is an intranasal capsid-binding agent that reached phase 3 clinical trials for HRV prevention and treatment in the 1990s. the development of pirodavir has been discontinued (241) a placebo-controlled trial using two different doses of recombinant nasal spray was performed with subjects with naturally occurring colds. subjects receiving the higher dose of interferon nasal spray experienced a longer duration of symptoms and more severe sore throat and nasal congestion, likely a toxicity of the treatment (246). a study of children and college students using a dried extract of E. purpurea and a dried mixture of E. angustifolia root failed to show a reduction in URI symptom severity or duration (250, 251) that study found a nonstatistically significant trend toward reduced symptom severity and duration in subjects assigned to the Echinacea treatment group. the fda has not evaluated Echinacea for safety and efficacy. Zinc Zinc inhibits viral replication in vitro (257), block HRV binding to ICAM-1 molecules (258), and decrease histamine release (260) a cochrane review of 32 trials confirmed a mild effect of first-generation antihistamines on rhinorrhea and sneezing. however, this benefit was not replicated with nonsedating antihistamines. in clinical practice, their use is limited by side effects such as dry eyes, nose, and mouth. other agents are evaluated for HRV prevention and treatment that failed to show a benefit in clinical trials. the most rigorous studies of pleconaril were conducted with patients with respiratory illnesses. pleconaril-treated subjects experienced a 1-day reduction in the duration of illness compared to the placebo group (235). pleconaril-treated subjects experienced a greater reduction in the duration of symptoms than subjects with reduced viral susceptibility (236). vapendavir exhibits antiviral activity against known HRV-A and HRV-B serotypes. activity against HRV-C has not yet been established. vapendavir was well tolerated and reduced the incidence of HRV and the peak viral load (238) two phase 3 multicenter studies in the united states and canada randomized 2,096 healthy subjects with self-diagnosed colds into groups receiving pleconaril twice daily or matching placebo for 5 days. pleconaril-treated subjects experienced a 1-day reduction in the duration of illness (7.3 days versus 6.3 days; P 0.001) compared to the placebo group (235). pleconaril-treated subjects infected with more highly susceptible viruses experienced a greater reduction in the duration of symptoms than subjects with reduced vapendavir was well tolerated and reduced the incidence of HRV and the peak viral load (238) a phase 2b treatment study with asthmatic adults to assess the effect of vapendavir on URI symptom severity and asthma exacerbations was recently completed. rupintrivir was well tolerated and reduced viral loads and respiratory symptoms (242) but in trials of natural infection, rupintrivir did not significantly affect viral loads and symptom severity (243). intranasal IFN-2 has shown some benefit for the prevention of HRV colds. purea, Echinacea angustifolia, and Echinacea pallida are manufactured by using a range of extraction methods. chemical constituents that may be important in Echinacea health effects include alkylamides, polysaccharides, and caffeic acid derivatives. human clinical trials of Echinacea therapy for experimental and natural clinical colds yielded conflicting results (247) a recent Cochrane review included 966 subjects from 13 randomized controlled trials in which all subjects began zinc therapy within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. the authors found that zinc supplementation within 24 h of the onset of a cold was associated with significantly reduced symptom severity and duration. zinc supplementation for at least 5 months was associated with reduced cold incidences, school absenteeism, and antibiotic prescriptions in children. antihistamines First-generation (i.e., nonselective) antihistamines, including clemastine fumarate and brompheniramine maleate, were evaluated in the 1990s for the treatment of experimental HRV colds. social distancing and respiratory mask application have been evaluated. Efforts to develop prophylactic medications and vaccinations have been unsuccessful. social distancing includes school closures and the avoidance of public gatherings. ethanol hand sanitizer was more effective than soap and water in removing detectable virus from the hand. the addition of organic acids (2% malic acid and 2% citric acid in a 70% solution of ethanol) persisted for at least 4 h. intranasal IFN-2 reduced respiratory illness when administered continuously during a respiratory virus season or intermittently as postexposure prophylaxis in the family setting. however, local adverse reactions, including mucosal friability, have limited its use (275, 276) there have been no HRV vaccines evaluated in clinical trials. challenges include the presence of more than 100 different HRV serotypes. the lack of epidemiological data to identify the most commonly circulating HRV strains. social distancing can be an effective public health prevention measure, reducing epidemic attack rates by as much as 90%. it remains uncertain whether surgical masks confer additional protection over surgical masks. ethanol hand sanitizer was more effective than soap and water in removing detectable virus from the hand. the hand treatment contained 2% citric acid and 2% malic acid in 62% ethanol. it was applied every 3 h for 9 weeks during the fall of 2009. the results were most robust for children, who are least capable of performing hygienic behaviors by themselves. vitamin C has been studied for the prevention and treatment of the common cold since 1942. in animal studies, vitamin C reduces the incidence and severity of bacterial and viral infections. the belief that these benefits extend to human subjects has existed for many years. VP1 plays a central role in receptor binding and subsequent epithelial cell infection. no studies have moved beyond the in vitro phase. however, no studies have moved beyond the in vitro phase."}
