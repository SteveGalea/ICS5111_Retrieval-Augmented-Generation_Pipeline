{"summary": "china is one of the largest and most populous countries in the world with nearly 20% of the world\u2019s population. despite a remarkable decline in its incidence from 2800 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10 per 100,000 in 1990, malaria has re-emerged in some areas since 2001. despite a remarkable decline in its incidence from 2800 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10 per 100,000 in 1990, malaria has re-emerged in some areas since 2001. public health professionals in china have estimated the risk of imported cases and proposed pro-active disease control and prevention actions to minimize the risk of the transmission of the disease to China [15]. this is partly because China has a close trade relationship with Africa involving a frequent flow of travelers [16,17,18]. overall infectious disease surveillance infrastructure, health workforce and underreporting of infectious diseases in some areas of china are of concern. previous research has demonstrated that the overall infectious disease surveillance infrastructure was underfunded in China, especially in poor and rural areas. despite relative supremacy of urban disease surveillance infrastructure over its rural counterpart, it still has some limitations. in rural and poor areas there are relatively few health workers who have been professionally trained to effectively deal with infectious disease outbreaks. the \u2018Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program\u2019 was established in 2001 with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control (USCDC) the importance of improving the infectious disease surveillance system is further accentuated by the likely impacts on infectious disease transmission of two important issues facing this nation: urbanization and climate change. rapid urbanization has brought numerous benefits to the country and substantially improved the country\u2019s standard of living on the whole. the migrants are often poor and less educated than the general population in urban areas. they typically live in low quality housing with inadequate sanitation, and have limited access to local health services. the \u201cfloating population\u201d itself is reluctant to spend its already limited discretionary resources on health care. accumulated garbage and discarded materials in cities provide food and habitat for rodents and vectors. poor drainage systems can also create breeding sites. high-density living is associated with close contact between humans. high-density living is associated with close contact between humans. studies have found that the average surface temperature in china has risen by 1.3 \u00b0C over the past 58 years. precipitation from 1900 to 2005 has declined in southern parts of china, but increased by 22%\u201333% in northwest china. these changes in climate will likely favor transmission of many climate-sensitive diseases by affecting the ecology of the diseases. the incidence of HFRS has also been associated with climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. hot and dry conditions and lower relative humidity may increase the mortality of rodents, reduce the survival rate of hantaviruses in the reservoir, and thus curb the transmission of HFRS. a timely, streamlined, well-funded and efficient disease reporting and surveillance system is essential to monitor the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks. a timely, streamlined, well-funded and efficient disease reporting and surveillance system is essential to monitor the threat of potential epidemics."}
