{"summary": "the first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus outbreak in poultry in 1996 occurred at a goose farm in china. in 2002, outbreaks reemerged in both terrestrial poultry and wild waterfowl. in 2003, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in poultry was confirmed for the first time in south Korea. in vitro studies have demonstrated that a substitution in the Mx protein (S631N) is associated with resistance to avian influenza virus infection in chickens [19,20] but some in vivo and in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate this association [15,21,22] the experimental protocol described that animals could die of the HPAIV infection and that animals would be euthanized if they manifested severe symptoms for 24 h. all experiments with live HPAIVs were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory at mahidol university, Thailand. the chickens were hatched in an incubator at the Faculty of Veterinary Medical Science, Mahidol University. at 3 weeks, the chickens were confirmed to be negative for H5-specific hemagglutination inhibition inhibition (HI) antibodies. survival rate of chicken infected with HPAIV was investigated in 11 groups. oculation, and tissue samples were obtained from the brain, lung, trachea, liver, spleen, and colon. portions of the lung, spleen, and brain tissue samples were preserved in RNAlater solution. at 14-weeks of age, the chickens were inoculated intranasally with 105 EID50/0.1 mL of HPAIV. swab and homogenized tissue samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until titration into SPF eggs. values for titration were calculated as described by Reed and Muench [27] and were expressed as EID50/mL and EID50/g respectively. serological analysis Sera were collected from all chickens before inoculation and from virus-infected and mock-inoculated chickens. the quantitative real-time PCR analysis was run on a Chromo4 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with the following cycle parameters: 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 60\u00b0C for 30 sec. the differences in gene expression were calculated by the 2\u2013Ct method and were expressed as the fold change in gene expression. primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, and 100\u2013500 ng of cDNA. reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 3 min. first and second PCR products were 1,311 bp and 1,485 bp long. the LR-PCR sizes of the BF1 and BF2 amplicons were 4,015 and 5,339 bp respectively. the sequencing primers used in this study were designed against regions in exons 2 and 3. based on time between inoculation and death: early phase (48 h) and late phase (>49 h) Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by logistic regression analysis. ethics statement All challenge experiments with H5N1 HPAIV were performed under the guidelines of the animal care and use committee. viral infectivity of each strain was determined by serial titration in 10\u201311-day-old embryonated eggs. the chickens were confirmed to be negative for H5-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. survival rate of chicken infected with HPAIV was investigated in 11 groups (n = 8) of 4-week-old white leghorn chickens. four groups of three white Leghorn chickens were inoculated with HPAIV. the chickens were euthanized with pentobarbital 24 h after inoculation. tissue samples were obtained from the brain, lung, trachea, liver, spleen, and colon. humane endpoint was applied when severe clinical signs were observed for more than 24 h. chickens that survived until 10 days after infection were also euthanized by pentobarbital injection (30\u201340 mg/kg) viral titration The swab and homogenized tissue samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until titration into SPF eggs. quantitative real-time PCR analysis was run on a Chromo4 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the differences in gene expression were calculated by the 2\u2013Ct method and were expressed as the fold change in gene expression. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using oligo(dT)20 primers and the Super-ScriptTM III First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR. cDNA samples, primers specific for target genes (TLR3, IFN, IFN, Mx1, OAS, IL6, IL8, and IL18), -actin, and SYBR Premix Ex Taq2 were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR primers were designed to amplify two overlapping fragments. the reaction mixture included 2.5 L of 10 PCR buffer, 0.625 U of Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), 1.5 mM MgCL2, 0.5 M each primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP. the BF1 and BF2 PCR products were separately amplified by long-range (LR) PCR as previously described. the primers pairs used for PCR amplification were BF1-Forward, 5\u2032-CCTATTCCCCCAACAGGTTACGCCC-3\u2032 and BF2-Forward, 5\u2032-ACAAGGGACCACAAGAGCTGTGCC-3\u2032 and BF2-Forward. the 10-L PCR mixture contained 100 ng of genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using oligo(dT)20 primers. PCR primers were designed to amplify two overlapping fragments. reaction conditions included an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 3 min. the primers used for sequencing were the same as those used for the PCR. genotype frequencies of each polymorphism were determined. the differences were analyzed to examine their role in sensitivity to HPAIV infection. the alleles were tentatively named according to a previous study. the BF1 and BF2 alleles were tentatively named according to a previous study. the nucleotide sequences of these four viruses, and that of pigeon-04, were compared. these viruses shared 99.1\u2013100% and 98.6\u2013100% homology and identity in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences. there are no differences in PA-X. openbill-1604 at 104 EID50 showed various macroscopic findings, such as swelling in the leg or face and discoloration of the comb or leg. the MDT was also longer compared to that in other groups (P 0.01). 0 7 (100) 2 (25) 8 (100) 8 (100) 7 (87.5) Mean death time (h) - 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 (Range) - (48\u2013120) (48) (48\u201372) (48\u2013120) chickens inoculated with openbill-1604 shed virus into the trachea at a significantly higher titer than chickens inoculated with other viruses. virus was not recovered from the five surviving chickens in the pigeon-04 group. chickens inoculated with openbill-1604 shed virus into the trachea at a significantly higher titer than chickens inoculated with other viruses. no virus was recovered from the examined organs of chickens infected with HPAIV at 104 EID50. three chickens in each group were sacrificed at 24 h post-inoculation. the level of mRNA expression of each gene was examined by real-time PCR analysis using specific to the gene. pigeon-4 showed lower pathogenicity in white leghorn chickens at 104 EID50. all chickens, except one PHD chicken, died because of virus inoculation. white Leghorn and Chee (P 0.01), Dang (P 0.01), and LHK (P 0.05) no significant differences were observed among the Thai indigenous chicken breeds. the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for each substitution are shown in S2 Table. no significant association was observed between the substitutions in the Mx gene and sensitivity to HPAIV. openbill-1604, crane-05, openbill-6-04, and pheasant-04 gene segments were determined. the nucleotide sequences of these four viruses, and that of pigeon-04 were previously determined. there are 58 amino acid differences in 11 proteins predicted in these five viruses. chickens infected with openbill-1604 at 104 EID50 showed various macroscopic findings, such as swelling in the leg or face and discoloration of the comb or leg. the MDT was also longer compared to that in other groups (P 0.01). survival rates differed significantly among the chickens inoculated with different viruses at the lower dose (P 0.01). asnt-05 at a dose of 104EID50. parameter control openbill-1604 pigeon-04 crane-05 openbill-6-04 pheasant-05 number of dead chickens. chickens inoculated with openbill-1604 shed virus into the trachea at a significantly higher titer than chickens inoculated with other viruses. virus was not recovered from the five surviving chickens in the pigeon-04 group. chickens inoculated with openbill-1604 shed virus into the trachea at a significantly higher titer than chickens inoculated with other viruses. no virus was recovered from examined organs of chickens infected with HPAIV at 104 EID50. three chickens in each group were sacrificed at 24 h post-inoculation. expression of IL-6 and two interferon-stimulated genes, OALS and Mx1, was upregulated. the brain was higher in pigeon-04-infected chickens than in openbill-1604- and crane-04-infected chickens at 106 EID50. the level of mRNA expression of each gene was examined by real-time PCR analysis using specific to the corresponding gene. all chickens, except one PHD chicken, died because of virus inoculation. no significant differences were observed among the different breeds of Thai indigenous chicken. swab titer in the trachea of White Leghorns was significantly higher than that in all four breeds of Thai indigenous chickens. cDNA was determined in the Thai indigenous chicken breeds (GenBank accession numbers: LC033614\u2013LC033670) and White Leghorn (GenBank accession numbers: LC033671\u2013LC033685) and 14 nucleotide polymorphisms with accompanying amino acid substitutions were identified. pigeon-04 showed the mildest pathogenicity in White Leghorn. pigeon-04 showed the mildest pathogenicity in white leghorn. pigeon-04 showed the mildest pathogenicity in white leghorn. NP. Openbill-6-04 possessed dual amino acid substitutions at positions 627 and 701 in the PB2 genes. this strain also possessed the other many unique substitutions at positions 627 and 701 in the PB2 genes, which affects polymerase activity in chickens and mice. cytokine mRNA expression in the lung at 24 h post infection abruptly decreased within the next 8 h. the increased pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAIV in chickens may be associated with the rapid replication of the virus in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells. the commercial breed of chicken used in this study appeared to be more sensitive to HPAIV than the Thai indigenous breeds. differences in sensitivity among breeds of chickens have been reported for other diseases, such as Marek\u2019s disease [41], and Sironi et al. reported variable responses of different chicken lines to HPAIV infection [15]. asparagine 631 allele of chicken Mx did not inhibit influenza virus replication. no association was found between the Mx genotype at residue 631 and the survival time after inoculation with HPAIV. hunt et al. performed an experiment using a series of MHC congenic white Leghorn chicken lines (B2, B12, B13, B19, and B21) none of the lines were completely resistant to a lethal challenge, as evidenced by mortality rates ranging from 40\u2013100% [50]. if a specific BF allele was related to resistance against HPAIV could not be determined. genetic diversity of Thai indigenous chickens may be useful tool for determining the host defense mechanism against HPAIV through extensive genetic analyses."}
