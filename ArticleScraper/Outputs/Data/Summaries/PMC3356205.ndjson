{"summary": "the mortality of patients afflicted with SARS is 15% on average. the mortality of patients afflicted with SARS is 50% or higher in patients aged 65 years and over. chelators are known to be antiallergic, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiviral and antibacterial agents. catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate are the most abundant catechins, particularly in tea and other plants. imide hydrochloride), bovine serum albumin (BSA), ampicillin, kanamycin, ()-catechin gallate, ()-gallocatechin gallate, and other molecules were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co (St Louis, MO) Quantum dots (QD605) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) the PCR product was digested with BamHI/SalI and then ligated into BamHI/SalI digested expression vector pET 24a+. the colony with insert gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). it was then plated on Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar containing 50 g mL1 kanamycin. the transformant was grown in a 250 mL flask the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein was purified with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography column (Qiagen, Germany) the bound protein was eluted with buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0) at 4\u00b0C. purity of the bound protein was estimated by sodium do jugated RNA oligonucleotide was collected at a QDs:RNA oligonucleotide molar ratio of 1:40 for 1 hour at room temperature. the chip was then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) for 1 minute. the signal intensity was determined by software for the LSM 510 (LSM Image Browser; Carl Zeiss) a histogram of the intensity was achieved from the region of the spotted chip. the value of signal intensity was achieved by calculating and expressing it as the mean intensity. tggatccatgtctgataatggacccca-3\u2032 containing restriction enzyme sites of BamHI/SalI. PCR was run with the following conditions on a thermal cycler. denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute; annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds; and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 2.5 minutes. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the cells were lysed by Sonicator\u00ae (F60 Sonic Dismembrator; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 pM of QD605 were conjugated with 400 pM of RNA oligonucleotide. the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein was directly immobilized onto the functional ProLinkerTM-terminated surface. the conjugated RNA oligonucleotide was facilitated by spotting on an immobilized. the polyphenolic compound used as inhibitor was spotted on the conjugated RNA oligonucleotide and the SARS-CoV N protein. after incubation for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C, the chip was then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) for 1 minute. secondary structure of RNA oligonucleotide binds to SARS-CoV N protein. expression and purification of RNA oligonucleotide was analyzed using the Mfold program. lane 2, total form of SARS-CoV N protein; lane 3, soluble form of SARS-CoV N protein; lane 4, his-tag form of SARS-CoV N protein. QDs-supported RNA oligonucleotide was conjugated in the reaction for the amide formation from the coupling of 5\u2032-end-amine-modified RNA oligonucleotide. the mobility shifts were compared. catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate showed high inhibition activity in a concentrated manner against SARS-CoV N protein. the chemical structures of ()-catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate are shown in Figure 3. optical images were obtained from the reaction mixtures on a plate using a QDs-based imaging system. the inhibition of the anti-SARS activity from ()-catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate were clearly illustrated. scheme for inhibitor screening of the SARS-CoV N protein on chip. we designed the QDs-conjugated specific RNA oligonucleotide for specific SARS-CoV N protein targeting. the recombinant recombinant SARS-CoV N protein was purified by a single chromatography step on a Ni2+ affinity column. the sequence is 5\u2032-gggagagcggaagcgugcggaagcgugcugggccugucgguuuacacgguuggcccc-3\u2032. agarose gel electrophoresis showed a band with mobility having a different band pattern between the free QDs and the QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide. the mobility shifts were compared. on agarose gel, the QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide showed a lower mobility shift than free QDs. oligonucleotide on the designed biochip showed more than 40% inhibition activity. the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of ()-catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate were found to be approximately 0.05 g mL1 respectively. other polyphenolic compounds to the inhibition of SARS-CoV N protein on the nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide biochip system were detected as nearly similar to the background abbreviations: N, nucleocapsid; SARS-CoV, severe respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. a novel function of ()-catechin gallate and ()-gallocatechin gallate as anti-SARS agents. this designed platform for a novel inhibitor assay possesses significant potential as a target screening. it is expected to be applicable to other types of diseases."}
