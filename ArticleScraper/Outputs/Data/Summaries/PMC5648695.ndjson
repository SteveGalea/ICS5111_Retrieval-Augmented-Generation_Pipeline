{"summary": "clinical microbiologists have a common bond forged by our membership in the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) in the united states, clinical microbiologists have a common bond forged by our membership in the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) the bond is forged by our membership in the american Society for microbiology (ASM) this pressure is likely only to increase as a wave of retirements drains it of significant intellectual capital. two events are currently shaping the Society's approach to supporting our discipline. one was the formation in 2010 of the Clinical Microbiology Task Force led by David Hooper. camp Clin Micro was organized independently of aSM. the clinical microbiologist will need to become a key member of multidisciplinary teams such as antimicrobial stewardship (5). the introduction of clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA)-waived NAATs for group A Streptococcus, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus has greatly improved the accuracy of point-of-care testing. testing and treating in these settings are likely to relieve pressure on both emergency department (ED) and clinical microbiology laboratories during periods of high utilization of both resources. a search of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology between November 2014 and March 2017 revealed 43 articles whose abstract or title contained that term. the discipline needs to do more to demonstrate the clinical impact of these new technologies. the clinical microbiology community needs to shift some of its research focus from detection and identification of microbes to studies that described how these advances actually improve patient outcomes. in 2011, a committee led by Alice Weissfeld was formed within the PPC to develop evidence-based clinical microbiology guidelines. the group published a systematic review of the effectiveness of practices aimed at reducing the time to targeted therapy for patients with bloodstream infections. fewer studies were considered of good quality (16) the clinical microbiology army is graying in a 2016 laboratory workforce survey. 80% of respondents were either laboratory supervisors/managers or directors. a shortage is likely to worsen, at least for the short-term, and perhaps longer. a 1-year clinical microbiologist scientist program is open to college graduates with a degree in microbiology. the individuals have a set curriculum, which is 40 h/week, and are paid an hourly wage with a job title of Clinical Laboratory Technologist Apprentice. the program will be geared for clinical microbiology laboratories facing recalcitrant staff shortages. 20 training programs open to scientists with a doctoral degree have increased by two thirds in the past decade due to the recognized need for individuals with these skills. the numbers of these programs have increased by two thirds in the past decade due to the recognized need for individuals with these skills and a strong job market. the open-access movement has changed the way in which we use reference books, if we use them at all, as has PubMed, Google searches, and Wikipedia. the clinical microbiology army is highly regarded by ASM staff and leadership as being fully committed to and tireless volunteers for the Society. our understanding of the human microbiome will challenge our notion of how we interact with microbes and how we define infectious diseases. today is the most exciting time to be a clinical microbiologist."}
