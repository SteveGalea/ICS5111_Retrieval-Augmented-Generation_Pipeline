{"summary": "the interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been described to inhibit infection by a wide range of viruses. the viruses that are restricted share the common ability to enter cells through endocytosis. inhibition by IFITM3 occurs prior to influenza virus fusion with the endosome (7). if the predicted topology is adopted, this residue would reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or endosomal lumen. however, known ubiquitin ligases are cytoplasmic, suggesting that the IFITM3 N terminus is localized in the cytoplasm. this is also supported by the discovery that phosphorylation of IFITM3 on tyrosine 20 (Y20) by the cytoplasmic kinase Fyn hek293T cells were transfected overnight in 6-well plates with 1 g/well of plasmids expressing HA-mIFITM1, HA-IFITM1-C49A, HA-IFITM1-C50A, HA-IFITM1-C83A, HA-mIFITM-C103A, or HA-mIFITM3. cells were visualized by confocal microscopy after paraformal the topology of active IFITMs remains controversial due to earlier immunostaining experiments indicating that both the N and C termini of IFITM3 are extracellular (1, 15) we hypothesize that murine IFITM1 (mIFITM1) may serendipitously provide evidence that the C terminus of a naturally occurring and antivirally active IFITM variant is exposed to cytoplasmic enzymes. we cloned mIFITM1 into the pCM mIFITM1 conserved cysteines contributed to mIFITM1 palmitoylation. loss of C103 did not dramatically decrease palmitoylation in the presence of intact conserved cysteines. mIFITM1, HA-mIFITM1-C103A, HA-mIFITM3, or HA-mIFITM3-3CA construct or 4.0 g of the HA-mIFITM1-3CA or -4CA mutant was transfected into HEK293T cells. palmitoylation at the mIFITM1 C terminus would preclude adoption of the predicted topology. mIFITM1 mutants were transfected with equal amounts of plasmids. cells were treated with 25 M proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) or DMSO as a control for 24 h. the poor expression observed for the 3CA and 4CA mutants was efficiently rescued by MG132 treatment. the difference in fold changes observed for palmitoylation is likely due to palmitoylation occurring on multiple cysteines per mIFITM1 molecule. hek293T cells were transfected overnight with 1 g/well plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. the level of HA-mIFITM1 in the presence of GST was set at a value of 1.0, and the error bars indicate the standard errors of the means of the four experiments. blotting with anti-HA antibody demonstrated the levels of HA-mIFITM1 as well as the expression of HA-zDHHC7. transfected cells were mock infected or infected with influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 for 6 h, fixed, and stained with anti-HA antibody (Covance) cells were gated based on the expression of the IFITMs. an empty vector transfection control provided a baseline for maximum infection. hek293T cells were transfected overnight in 12-well plates with 0.5 g/well of pCMV-HA as a vector control or plasmids expressing HA-mIFITM1, HA-mIFITM1C103A, or HA-mIFITM3. cells were fixed and stained with anti-HA antibodies to measure HA-mIFITM1 or -3 levels and with anti-influenza nucleoprotein antibody or anti HA-positive cells were gated based on lack of staining in the vector control. analyzed for percent infection based on anti-influenza nucleoprotein antibody or anti-SeV antiserum staining. the progression of infection in mice missing all IFITMs was indistinguishable from the progression of infection by the knockout of IFITM3 alone (25, 26) mutation in humans rendering IFITM3 inactive occurred more frequently in patients hospitalized for severe influenza virus infection than in a control population (25, 26). this conundrum may be explained by the inherent instability of IFITM1, which requires palmitoylation to prevent its proteasomal degradation (Fig. 2)."}
