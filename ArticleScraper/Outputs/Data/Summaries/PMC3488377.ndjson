{"summary": "a previously healthy 4-year-old girl became dyspneic and critically ill with pneumonia and multiorgan system failure. she had been febrile with chills for 4 days (39\u00b0C), breathless and coughing for 2 days. her immunizations were up-to-date and she received a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine at age 2 years. hemoglobulin 8.0 g/dL, platelets 87 109/L, and white cell count 1 109/L. activated partial thromboplastin time APTT was 47.9 seconds, prothrombin time PT 13.4 seconds, d-dimer 2192 ng/mL, plasma urea 18.2 mmol/L, creatinine 214 umol/L. aspirate yielded leucocytes and Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 19A) sensitive to cefotaxime and penicillin. postmortem examination confirmed generalized necrotizing pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage. the proximal tubules of both kidneys showed acute tubular necrosis but no microangiopathic thrombosis. amoxicillin should be used as first-line therapy for previously healthy infants and preschool-aged children with mild to moderate CAP suspected to be of bacterial origin. macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens. laboratory testing for M. pneumoniae should be performed if available in clinically relevant time frame. pathogen has been reported to be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. local antimicrobial sensitivity in PICU patients has been reported. pathogen was sensitive to penicillin and cefotaxime in this case. the presence of pathogens in the tracheal and nasopharyngeal aspirates represents infection in the lower respiratory tract rather than carriage in the upper airway. both pathogens are known to cause pneumonia on their own and are not commonly carried by healthy young persons."}
