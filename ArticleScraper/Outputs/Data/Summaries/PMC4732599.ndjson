{"summary": "enteric viruses are shed in enormous quantities in feces (109 to 1010/g) they are mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route either by person-to-person contact or by ingestion of contaminated water and food. they survive for long periods of time on food or food contact surfaces or in water (ground, surface, and drinking water) determination and qualitative detection of noV and HAV in foodstuffs were published [14, 15, 16]. the aim of this study was to develop real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of a total of 19 human enteric viruses (including 3 genogroupes of norovirus and 4 coronaviruses) and two control process viruses (mengovirus and murine norovirus). the extracted RNA was confirmed with RT-qPCR and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 / 280 nm with a NanoDrop ND-1000. based on this approach, the production stock of MNV-1 had titres of approximately 1.36 x 1012 genome copies / mL. the current system of mandatory reporting was approved by the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (deliberation n\u00b0 02\u2013082, November 19 2002). patients receive oral and written information on the finality of the notification and on the modalities of information recording. this information is available on the web site of the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (IVS) at http://www.invs.sante.fr/content/download/6498/42945/version the faecal samples were suspended in 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7, to obtain a final 10% suspension (w/v), vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the extracted genomic RNA/DNA of adenovirus, astrovirus and rotavirus were confirmed with RT-qPCR and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 / 280 nm with noV GI plasmid was digested with NCOI (Life technologies) and HEV DNA, HAV DNA and noV GII DNA plasmids were digested with SpeI (Life technologies) transcripts were obtained by using a MEGAscript\u00ae kit (Life technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. synthesized DNA and RNA were confirmed with (RT)-qPCR. pBluescriptIISK+ was cloned into the pBluescriptIISK+ vector by Genecust (Dudelange, Luxembourg) all recombinant plasmids were purified by Genecust and used to produce RNA transcripts.

RT-dPCR was compared to real-time (RT)-PCR for quantifying 19 human enteric viruses and two control process viruses. the number of RNA genome copies determined by digital RT-PCR was often lower than the number of copies expected using spectrophotometry. one potential cause of discrepancy could be errors introduced by spectrophotometric determination of the nucleic acid concentration, leading to an overestimation of the copy genome number [29, 30]. RT-qPCR array assays involve three separate steps (RT, preamplification and PCR) nineteen enteric viruses and two control process viruses were targeted. the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR array assays was lower (by 0.8 to 3.8 log10) than the limits of detection obtained with conventional RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR."}
