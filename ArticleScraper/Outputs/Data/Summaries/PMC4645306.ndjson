{"summary": "cellular organisms have evolved sophisticated and highly diversified antiviral defense strategies to secure their survival. the immune system of higher organisms is classically divided into two branches: the innate immune system, which recognizes and counteracts pathogens in a generic and unspecific way, and the adaptive immune system, which is antigen specific. four well-characterized antiretroviral restriction factors are TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5), APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G), SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1), and tetherin. tetherin inhibits diverse enveloped viruses, including retro-, filo-, rhabdo tetherin inhibits the release of newly formed virions by directly linking viral and cellular membranes (28). only mammalian orthologs have been described to further elucidate its role in intrinsic antiviral immunity. the CHO IIIB2A cell line and its PIG-L-deficient derivative were first described by Nakamura and colleagues. they were stably transfecting CHO-K1 cells with expression vectors for DAF and CD59. transfected HEK293T and CHO cells were lysed in TMPER and M-PER buffer. two days posttransfection, cells were stained extracellularly with an antibody against the FLAG tag (F1804; Sigma) and a secondary allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (A-865; Invitrogen) fluorescence was detected by two-color flow cytometry, and surface expression levels of eGFP-positive cells were calculated. HEK293T or CHO cells were seeded in ibidi 8-well -s cells and supernatants were lysed in Triton X-100 at 40 h posttransfection. the relative levels of p24 release were determined using a homemade p24 immunosorbent assay.

(35) they were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mM glutamine, streptomycin (120 mg/ml), and penicillin (120 mg/ml) e or anti-rabbit IRDye Odyssey antibodies and proteins were detected using a Li-COR Odyssey scanner. cells were transfected with 5 g (HEK293T, calcium phosphate, 6 wells) or 1 g (CHO, Lipofectamine LTX, 12 wells) of vectors coexpressing eGFP and the respective gene. two days posttransfection, cells were stained extracellularly with an antibody against the FLAG tag (F1804; Sigma hek293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 5 g of a proviral construct. at 40 h posttransfection, cells and supernatants were lysed in Triton X-100. the relative levels of p24 release were determined using a homemade p24 immunosorbent assay. anchor probability Exon 1 Exon 2 Exon 3 Exon 5 Exon 6 Exon 7 NP_001231044 Cricetulus griseus (human) 288 181 40 103 203 99.9 XP_007489270 Monodelphis domestica (gray short-tailed opossum) 246 55 61 100 153 100.00 XP_012399618 Sarcophilus harrisiia (Tasmanian de orthologs of tetherin (also called BST2 or CD317) have been identified in a variety of placental mammals, including primates, rodents, ungulates, and carnivorans (36). to identify novel tetherin orthologs, we combined sequence analyses to identify novel tetherin orthologs. an initial BLAST search using known tetherin sequences led to the identification of potential tetherin/bst2 orthologs in marsupials (Monodelphis domesticus, Sarcophilus harrisii), crocodilians (Alligator sinensis), turtles (Chrysemis picta, Pelodiscus sinensis), and birds (Meleagris gallopavo) all genes identified share similar exon tetherin orthologs may have been missed due to low sequence homology between tetherins from different vertebrate classes. tetherin orthologs may have been missed due to low sequence homology between tetherins. a tetherin gene arose early during vertebrate evolution, at least 450 million years ago, before the separation of cartilaginous fish from bony vertebrates. many bird species lack an obvious tetherin open reading frame (ORF) and seem to contain deletions in the plvap/cilp2 intergenic region (Fig. 2A) turkeys also contain such a cilp2-tetherin fusion gene in addition to their regular tetherin ortholog. this suggests that duplication events and gene rearrangements may have preceded the gene loss in the cilp2-plvap locus. red numbers indicate divergence time estimates (in millions of years) for major nodes determined on the basis of data from Green et al. (crocodilian-bird divergence) (74) and Jarvis et al. (intra-avian divergence) (73). only the C-terminal ends of the fusion proteins are depicted. western blotting showed that all orthologs are efficiently expressed from CMV promoter-based expression vectors. the detection of multiple bands ranging from 18 kDa to more than 125 kDa suggested that all tetherins are subject to posttranslational modifications. Flow cytometry revealed that all these proteins are expressed at the cell surface, where virion trapping occurs (17) mutant CHO cells lacking a functional pig-l gene. cells were permeabilized and incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody. tetherin surface levels were reduced in the absence of a functional GPI anchor. tetherin's ability to restrict virus release evolved at least 310 million years ago. human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) from HEK293T cells cotransfected with increasing amounts of tetherin and a vpu-deficient mutant of HIV-1 NL4-3 failed to antagonize this restriction factor. two days posttransfection, cells and supernatants were harvested and p24 contents were determined by ELISA. ponticulins do not restrict virus release, although they share a tetherin-like topology. only a very small number of proteins containing an N-terminal TMD and a C-terminal GPI anchor have been described. ponticulins span the membrane multiple times via hydrophobic -strand structures. dashes indicate gaps that were introduced to improve the alignment. -Sheets were predicted using PSIPRED v3.3 and are highlighted in green. all tetherin orthologs tested are able to inhibit the egress of enveloped viruses from infected cells. the general topology consisting of an N-terminal TMD, a coiled-coil ectodomain, and a C-terminal GPI anchor is highly conserved. however, there is often only minimal sequence homology between different tetherin orthologs (36) the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 bioinformatics tool predicted the presence of an N-terminal TMD with a length of 16 to 23 amino acids (aa) the probability of the presence of a C-terminal GPI anchor was >95% for most of these species. the COILS/PCOILS algorithm predicted the presence of extracellular left-handed coiled-coil domains in all proteins. sequence alignment of tetherin orthologs from mammals, reptiles, and fishes indicates gaps that were introduced to improve the alignment. predicted TMDs are highlighted in red and coiled-coil regions in blue. X1 to X3 designate different tetherin isoforms from one species. gene erosion may have resulted in the loss of tetherin in many bird species. tetherin emerged before the divergence of reptiles and birds from mammals. many bird species lack an obvious tetherin open reading frame (ORF) cilp2/plvap syntenic block has been disrupted and tetherin is not flanked by the cilp2 and plvap genes. the high incidence of deletions and gene rearrangements is in line with recent observation that birds have experienced a massive reduction in genome size. we selected orthologs of humans and coelacanths as well as both isoforms (X1 and X2) of Chinese alligator tetherin. these species represent the groups of mammals, fish, and Sauropsida. phenotype was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected HEK293T and CHO (Fig. 3A) cells. substantial amounts of coelacanth and alligator X1 tetherin were also localized to a perinuclear compartment. mutant CHO cell line lacks functional pig-l gene. localization of human tetherin was restricted to intracellular compartments. similar redistribution from cell surface to cytoplasm was observed for hamster, coelacanth, and alligator tetherins. the ability to restrict the egress of budding virions evolved at least 310 mya. the ability to restrict the egress of budding virions evolved. at least 310 mya, before the divergence of reptiles from mammals. surface expression was completely abrogated in the absence of a functional pig-l gene. the combination of an N-terminal TMD and a C-terminal GPI anchor is not sufficient to confer antiviral activity to a protein. the extracellular loop of ponticulin linking the TMD and GPI anchor is only very short and is not predicted to adopt a coiled-coil structure. eGFP and HEK293T cells cotransfected with a vpu-deficient proviral construct of HIV-1 NL4-3 and increasing amounts of expression vectors for human tetherin or ponticulin A or B. two days posttransfection, cells and supernatants were harvested and p24 contents were determined by ELISA. the results of five to seven independent experiments SEM are shown. tetherin is predicted to have an N-terminal TMD followed by a coiled-coil region and a 30% probability of a GPI anchor at its C terminus. however, the overall homology is very low and it remains to be determined whether PLVAP constitutes the true ancestor of tetherin. the specific viruses that have driven the early evolution of tetherin remain unknown. influenza A viruses infect host species, including mammals, birds, and possibly even reptiles. tetherin is probably one of more than 1,000 vertebrate genes that have been lost in many bird species. this suggests that tetherin may have been lost independently several times during evolution. some species increase their tetherin repertoire by expressing different isoforms from a single gene. some species increase their tetherin repertoire by expressing different isoforms from a single gene. other species may produce different tetherin isoforms via alternative splicing. the coelacanth ortholog showed only a weak antiviral effect. the coelacanth ortholog showed only a weak antiviral effect. the cell membranes of cold-blooded fish and warm-blooded mammals differ in their lipid composition and fluidity. tetherin is an evolutionarily ancient protein that is substantially (>450 million years) older and more widespread than the APOBEC3 and TRIM5 genes. tetherin does not interact with viral proteins or nucleic acids but targets viral membranes. tetherin tolerates many amino acid substitutions since its antiviral activity does not depend on its primary amino acid sequence. some vertebrate species seem to have lost their tetherin gene. whether these species encode unknown paralogs of tetherin or if unrelated proteins have also acquired this effective antiviral activity remains to be investigated."}
