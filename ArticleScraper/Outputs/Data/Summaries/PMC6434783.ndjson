{"summary": "quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is a powerful, commonly-used method for gene expression analysis. but the accuracy of the quantitative data produced depends on the appropriate selection of reference genes. we selected nine candidate reference genes, including six traditional housekeeping genes (ACT, -TUB, -TUB, UBC, CYP, and EF1-) _MOESM1_ESM.docx (1.7MB, docx) Additional file 1: Table S1. Ct values of the 9 candidate reference genes. Figure S1. Specificity of primer pairs for qRT-PCR amplification."}
