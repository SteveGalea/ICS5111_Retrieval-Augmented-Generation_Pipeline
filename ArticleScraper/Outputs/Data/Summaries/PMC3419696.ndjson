{"summary": "dsRNA genome encodes ten viral proteins (VP), including seven structural proteins (VP1-7) and three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2 and NS3 [1], [2], [3]. as a member of arboviruses, BTV is transmitted by certain species of Culicoides biting midges, including C. variipennis and C. imocola [4], [5]. the 1998\u20132001 outbreak of BTV-8 in the Mediterranean Basin is the greatest epizootic of the disease on record. in 2006, BTV-8 has reached three northern Europe countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany [28], [29], and further spread to surrounding countries, reaching Switzerland by the end of October 2007 [6], [30], [31], [32]. results from the previous studies [34], we selected and evaluated the virostatic efficacy of a cluster of active compounds. we selected 2\u20134 representative compounds from each cluster and assessed their virostatic efficacies against BTV. the EC50 of these lead compounds were determined between 0.7 M and 20 M, respectively (results not shown). virostatic efficacy and cytotoxicity were shown in (A) C003 and (B) C001. cell viability (triangles) or cytotoxicity (circles) was measured using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. each data point represents means and standard deviation from five replicates. our approach to C052 (IC2a) and C055 (IC3a) involved a convergent pathway whereby (1) the Gewald reaction was employed for the thiophene unit (IC4 of zone 1). (2) a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (IC5) and 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (IC6) with malonic acid provided a means to IC7 and cell viability (triangles) or cytotoxicity (circles) was determined using CellTiter-Glo reagent. each data point represents means and SD from five replicates. cell viability assay determines number of viable cells in culture. BTV-induced CPE was prevented after cells were treated with C003 or C052. cells formed a monolayer with no cells detached from the plates. at 72 h.p.i., BTV infected cells showed CPE/apoptosis. caspase-3/7 activity was 3.3-fold reduced at 48 h.p.i. inhibitions of caspase-3/7 activity were similar to inhibition of C003 at similar concentrations. compared with caspase-3/7 activity in cells infected with BTV without C003 treatment. at 24 h.p.i., there were one log differences of virus progeny production in cells treated with C003 or C052 at 10.0 M and 2.5 M respectively. there were three- or two-log reductions of progeny virus production in samples collected at 48 h.p.i. and 72 h.p.i. after treated with C003 or C052. the effects of C003 and C052 on the BTV plaque reduction were in a dose-dependent fashion. at 72 h.p.i., a one-log reduction of plaque formation was observed. when applied at higher concentrations, i.e. 20.0 M of C003 or C052, more than two-log of plaque reductions were observed. both compounds showed no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE. when added at 32 h.p.i., both C003 and C052 showed similar protection in term of the percentage of viable cells. effects of C003 and C052 on BTV viral genomic RNA replication in infected cells. samples were collected post BTV infection and divided into cells and supernatants portion at different time in the initial 24 h.p.i.. supernatant samples collected at 24 h.p.i from BTV infected. there were 6.17106 copies of BTV viral genomic RNA. there were only 4.81104 or 4.22104 copies of BTV viral genomic RNA. this result indicated a pronounced effect of these virostatic agents at the late stage of viral life-cycle. VP6 is an integral part of a transcription complex essential for primary replication [14]. at MOI of 0.01, VP6 was not detectable at 24 h.p.i. in all samples, but was detected at 48 h.p.i. in BTV-infected cells without C003/C052 treatment. this result supported previous observations that C003/C052 reduced viral protein expression when infected at low MOI of 0.01. the turnover of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to LC3-II is the only biomarker that is reliably associated with the formation of autophagosome. this is related to virus replication and the leading indicator of virus-induced apoptosis. lead virostatic agents against BTV Based on the previously identified six compound clusters [34], we selected 2\u20134 representative compounds from each cluster and assessed their virostatic efficacies against BTV. the EC50 of these lead compounds were determined between 0.7 M and 20 M, respectively. the four thiophene derivative compounds from cluster I, i.e. compound 001 through 004 (C001, C002, C003 and C004), showed potent vir cell viability (triangles) or cytotoxicity (circles) was measured using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. each data point represents means and standard deviation (SD) from five replicates. de novo synthesized analogs, C052, showed an improved virostatic efficacy with EC50 at 0.270.12 M and EC90 of 2.51.04 M respectively. virostatic efficacy and cytotoxicity of C052 were shown as cells were infected with BTV at MOI of 0.01 in the presence of various concentrations of C052. both C003 and C052 Prevented BTV Induced CPE. cell viability assay determines number of viable cells in culture. cell morphology changes at different h.p.i. were examined post BTV infection. no changes in term of cell morphology (C) when cells were treated with C003 and with BTV infection (D) no cytotoxicity (E) and C052 could block BTV-induced CPE/apoptosis (F) BSR cells were mock infected or infected with BTV at 0.01, and treated with C003 or C052 at their EC90 concentrations (A) or EC50 concentrations (B). at 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i, caspase-3/-7 activities were determined using the Caspase-Glo-3/7 reagent. i. and 72 h.p.i. after treated with C003 or C052 respectively. reduction of progeny virus production was also noticeable in the supernatant samples after treated with C003 or C052. higher concentrations, i.e. 20.0 M of C003 or C052, were observed. there was no difference in terms of the size or formation of the plaques. this result showed that C003 and C052 could reduce the viral plaque formation directly. both compounds showed no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE. the first cycle of BTV viral replication usually completed within 24 h.p.i. both compounds showed no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE. samples were divided into cells and supernatants portion at different time in the initial 24 h.p.i., with and without treatments of C003 (10 M) and C052 (2.5 M), respectively. the viral genomic RNA copies and progeny virus titers in the supernatant samples represent the events occurred inside the cells for the initial viral-life cycle. the effects of C003 and C052 on BTV viral genomic RNA synthesized and progeny virus production at MOI of 0.01. BTV infected cells were treated with C003 (10 M) or C052 (2.5 M), at different h.p.i. as indicated in figures. BTV-infected cells were treated with C003 at10 M and C052 at 2.5 M respectively. there were either very low or no detectable VP6 expression in the cells at 48 h.p.i. this result supported previous observations that C003/C052 reduced viral protein expression when infected at low MOI of 0.01. autophagy was not activated at 24 h post BTV infection. at 48 h.p.i., there was a turnover of LC3-I to LC3-II in BTV-infected cells without C003/C052 treatment. this result suggested that C003/C052 might act on interfering with BTV induced autophagy, consequently inhibiting BTV-induced CPE. the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative\u2013C003 was identified as a novel compound against BTV. it is plausible that the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative\u2013C003 was identified as a novel compound against BTV, with potent virostatic efficacy, low cytotoxicity and high SI. this leads to an improved virostatic compound\u2013C052 via de novo synthesis. the inhibition of caspsse-3/7 activation indicated the targets should be in the upstream of the cascade of caspase activation. however, when BSR cells were treated with pan-caspase inhibitor, cells were not protected from BTV-induced apoptosis. this suggests that while apoptosis/CPE was inhibited by C003/C052, the mechanism of action of these virostatic compounds might not directly related to BTV-induced apop a growing list of viruses has been shown to be targeted for autophagic degradation [62]. autophagy is actively involved in influenza A virus replication by triggering autophagosome formation. autophagosomes act as a site for translation and replication of dengue virus-2. autophagosomes act as a site for translation and replication of dengue virus-2. autophagy proteins enhance viral replication and progeny virus yields. virostatics targeting virus egress would be predicted to prevent or slow down virus release and spread in an infected host. further studies may be needed to define the exact mechanism of action for the virostatic agents C003/C052. all cells were incubated and grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. the type 10 BTV (BTV-10) was titrated by standard plaque assay. for virus replication, cell monolayers were washed with FCS-free growth medium. cells were sonicated for 40 s and cell debris removed by low-speed centrifugation. an equal volume (25 l) of CellTiter-Glo reagents was added to each well by a MicroFlo select dispenser (BioTek, Winooski, VT) after incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, luminescence signals were measured using Synergy-II multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek) after incubation for 15 minutes, luminescence signals were measured using an integration time of 0.1 s. the denoted 2 and 1 h.p.i. indicate that BSR cells were incubated with the selected virostatic compounds prior to BTV infection. for 0 h.p.i., the compound and BTV were added to each well simultaneously. cells without compounds and virus treatments were included as the mock infection control. Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 buffer was transferred into amber bottle containing Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 substrate. the premixed Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagents (Promega) were added at 11 ratio (reagent : media) to the treated cells at 48 h.p.i., or otherwise noted in the text. 3\u2032 SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis Samples were prepared after boiled in protein dissociation buffer [10% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol, 10% (wt/vol) SDS, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and 0.02% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue] for 10 min. say was carried out in the 24-well plates by including compounds in the overlay agarose. cells were initially inoculated with BTV at ten-fold series dilution with known initial BTV titer. each concentration was triplicated and the final virus titer was determined accordingly. cloned derivative of baby hamster kidney cells maintained in DMEM. all cells were incubated and grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. all cells were incubated and grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. the homogeneous CellTiter-Glo buffer and the lyophilized CellTiter-Glo substrate (Promega) were thawed and equilibrated to room temperature prior to use. an equal volume (25 l) of CellTiter-Glo reagents was added to each well by a microFlo select dispenser (BioTek, Winooski, VT) time-of-Addition assay was performed to further understand the virostatic activity of the previously identified compounds. cells were seeded and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 80\u201395% humidity. cells were then inoculated with BTV at MOI of 0.01 and incubated at the optimized conditions. is assay The caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 apoptosis assay kit was accomplished using the caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction, the real-time qRT-PCR was carried out using. qRT-PCR was performed in a single tube and amplified products were monitored in real-time using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. two BTV-specific primers were designated and used for the real-time qRT-PCR. hed three times for 10 min each in TBST and then incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 3% BSA\u2013TBST. bound antibodies detected by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) standard saponification of resultant IC9 and IC10 produced IC2b and IC3b. all compounds were characterized by high field NMR (Bruker AM 400) and high resolution mass spectral (Waters Q Premier API Quadrupole TOF Tandem mass spectrometer) purity confirmed by micro analytical elemental determinations."}
