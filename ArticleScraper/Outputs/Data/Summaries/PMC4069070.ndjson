{"summary": "the world health organization estimated an annual global burden of 207 million malaria cases and 627,000 deaths in 2012. of at least six different malaria parasite species, Plasmodium vivax is the second most parasite species of epidemiological importance. in most malaria-endemic areas, it coexists with P. falciparum, thus making its control more difficult. a total of 140 putative -helical coiled coil-containing proteins were identified as new target proteins in P. falciparum asexual blood stages. a total of 140 putative -helical coil-containing proteins of 200 to 10,000 amino acids in length were identified as new target proteins in P. falciparum. x orthologues were found to have at least 30% homology with the 170 previously identified P. falciparum -helical coiled-coil proteins. sequences were of the maximum length possible in order to maximize the stability of the -helical conformations and to increase the array of conformational epitopes. resulting construct was HPLC-purified; purity was confirmed by analytic C18 HPLC and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF); all reagents were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) and Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). addition, five P. falciparum polypeptides were recorded on a JASCO J-810 spectrometer (JASCO corporation, Tokyo, Japan) human antibodies specific to Pf-P27 and Pf-P45 [26] were affinity-purified from a pool of human serum samples from adults living in Burkina Faso. mice were injected three times with selected antigens formulated in Montanide ISA 720 adjuvant (Seppic Inc., Paris, France) ELISA test Antibody responses to the tested antigens were measured in human and murine sera by ELISA as described previously. human sera were tested at a 1200 dilution, while murine sera were tested at three-fold serial dilutions starting at 1100. ELISA experiments were performed in duplicates in two independent experiments. all fragments were orthologous to P. falciparum. a different -helical coiled coil non-related antigen was used. commercial mouse anti-IFN- ELISpot kit (Mabtech AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was used. multiscreen 96-well plates were coated overnight at room temperature with 5 g/mL anti-mouse IFN- antibodies. RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was used as a blocking solution. P. vivax orthologues were found to have at least 30% homology with the 170 previously identified P. falciparum -helical coiled-coil proteins. sequences were of the maximum length possible in order to maximize the stability of the -helical conformations and to increase the array of conformational epitopes. Peptide synthesis Fifty P. vivax polypeptides 25 to 57 amino acids long were synthesized by fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (F-moc) solid-phase chemistry [38] using an intavis AG bioanalytical synthesizer (Germany) the result was HPLC-purified; purity was confirmed by analytic C18 HPLC and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Applied Biosystem n = 42) were collected from maprik district of the east Sepik province. the Colombian samples were obtained from two geographically distant and epidemiologically different malaria-endemic sites. previous infection with P. vivax was confirmed based on a positive P. vivax blood-stage immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) result. ELISA test Antibody responses to the tested antigens were measured in human and murine sera by ELISA as described previously [40]. mice were euthanized by anesthetic inhalation and spleens and lymph nodes were aseptically removed. the final reaction was read at 405 nm in a microplate reader. cut-off points were calculated as three SD above the mean absorbance value of sera. e IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., Baltimore, MD) diluted 11000. slides were mounted in 30% glycerol and examined under a microscope by epifluorescence. IFAT used as antigen, Pf-FCB-1 blood-stage parasites. ts were visualized by adding 50 L/well of BCIP/NBT (Sigma) results were expressed as the mean number of IFN- spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 cells. results were expressed as the mean number of IFN- spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 cells. one of the proteins is predicted to be located in the mitochondria (PvPep39); none contained a GPI anchor. hypothetical protein 557\u2013781 PvPep52 3617 PVX_123480 PFL0770w VEQVKKEINQINEQININETKITHLRNKIE 176\u2013205 Secretory pathway 166\u2013207 PvPep63 3658 PVX_118160 PF07_0086 NNEMDETLSKLKKDINKLNEKIQKYDNYVK 207\u2013236 Hypothetical protein 162\u2013244 PvP AEAAPENAEPVHENAE 773\u2013809 Secretory pathway 773\u2013809 PvPep96.03 4482 PVX_084385 PF13_0107 DVQRIDTINKNISTINDDVDHINSNINNINDNLHKINSH 2051\u20132089 Hypothetical protein 2049\u20132088 PvPep101 3554 PVX_085155 PF14_0255 NKLTEMRRKLKIIDEKVQSVY representative CD spectra of peptides (A) PvPep40 and (B) PvPep63 were done at room temperature on 150 g/mL samples in aqueous solutions. spectrums came from the averages of duplicates in the far UVs, from 190 to 250 nm and were smoothed with a 5 points filter. eptide Protein n Percentage Percentage Percentage p valued ratio>2 PvPep5 PVX_003585 15 36 24 8 9 5 0.0004 0.0016 PvPep27 PVX_113335 25 60 43 66 73 24 ns 0.0421 PvPep40 PVX_119385 13 31 17 8 9 1 0.0021 0.0014 PvPep42 PVX_087730 12 29 26 69 bCorresponds to number and percentage of positive volunteers.

NG or Colombian sera were used for mice immunization and immune response testing. 19 of the 50 fragments tested containing -helical coils were recognized by sera of individuals living in P. vivax endemic areas of PNG and Colombia. antibodies to PvPep43 and PvPep82.02 were cross-reactive with the orthologous P. falciparum antigen. both sera from mice immunized with PvPep27 and specific purified human IgG were reactive with both Pf-P27 and PvPep43. rum antigen was not reactive with anti-PvPep45 mouse sera. none of the antibodies tested showed cross-reactivity with the native protein in blood stages. most of the peptides induced strong IFN- production as expected. coiled coil motifs should be extended to the entire group of erythrocytic parasite antigens. poly-subunit antigens should be designed, containing both relevant P. vivax and P. falciparum fragments capable of inducing effective immune responses."}
