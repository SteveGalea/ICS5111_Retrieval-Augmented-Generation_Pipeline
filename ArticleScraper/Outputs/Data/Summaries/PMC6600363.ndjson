{"summary": "flavonoids can be classified into two types: monoflavonoids (e.g., quercitrin [4]) and polyflavonoids (e.g., tetrahydroamentoflavone [5]) by comparison, triflavonoids and tetraflavonoids are very rare in natural products [2,7,8,9] isoginkgetin and its monomer acacetin were selected as the model compounds in this study. it is believed that the comparison between isoginkgetin and acacetin will provide important evidence as to whether there is a difference in antioxidant potential between a monoflavone and its 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-dimer. the flavonoid monomer of amentoflavone-4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032\u2032,7,7\u2032\u2032-tetramethyl ether (i.e., amentoflavone-4\u2032,7-dimethyl ether) has not yet been found. isoginkgetin and acacetin can be considered as an ideal pair for the comparative study. acacetin and its 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-dimer isoginkgetin were examined by using the O2\u2013 scavenging assay. acacetin and its 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-dimer isoginkgetin effectively scavenge ROS. the higher IC50 value means that acacetin is an inferior antioxidant to isoginkgetin. the IC50 value is defined as the lowest concentration with 50% radical inhibition or relative reducing power. acacetin and isoginkgetin effectively increased their ABTS+ scavenging ability with increasing concentration. however, the ET potential of acacetin was weaker than isoginkgetin, according to the IC50 values listed in Table 1. the two planar moieties do not share the same plane. the dihedral angle of 45\u00b0 implies that the two acacetin residues are partially planar. partial \u2013 conjugation can occur through the 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-linkage. this partial \u2013 conjugation can slightly increase the ET potential. /MS peaks include those at m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283. it should be emphasized that other possible linkages between the two acacetin residues cannot be excluded, such as 7-O, 5\u2032\u2032-O, 6-C, 8-C, and 6\u2032\u2032-C. the formula [C32H22O10-H] was extracted; (H) MS spectra of authentic isoginkgetin; (I) MS/MS spectra of authentic isoginkgetin (from the precursor m/z 565.1125). the standard isoginkgetin yielded eight MS/MS peaks, including those at m/z 565, 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151. 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (C18H12N5O6, CAS number 95407-69-5) was purchased from TCI Shanghai Ltd.
