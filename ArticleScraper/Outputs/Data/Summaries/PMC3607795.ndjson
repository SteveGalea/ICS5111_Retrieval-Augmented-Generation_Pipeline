{"summary": "a vast majority of plant viruses are (+) RNA viruses. RNA viruses demonstrate a large level of variability in their genetic information. recombination was demonstrated for many RNA virus species, whether under natural or experimental conditions. mechanisms of genetic RNA recombination in mRNA viruses and factors influencing the RNA\u2013RNA crossovers. one group of questions revolves around features that define the sites of crossovers. the transcriptional activity seems to promote template switching. template switching was found to occur between related but also unrelated RNA templates, generating legitimate (homologous) and illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombinants. switches depend on sequence composition, with the AU-rich regions promoting the RdRp detachment and upon secondary structures. fidelity might be a matter of a nanosecond timescale complex dynamic in the RdRp enzyme that determines RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis. the use of engineered replicase variants in RNA recombination assays will shed new light on the molecular details of template switching mechanisms. coat protein (CP) was demonstrated during reverse transcription in the virions. CP molecules likely mediate RNA crosses via dimerization/oligomerization of bound CP subunits. CP may also affect the properties of viral replicase. RNA are guided by secondary structures that direct the attack of a 3\u2032 hydroxyl onto the phosphodiester bonds. later observations revealed enormous variability of the poliovirus genome. more recent results with partially-complementary RNA-oligonucleotides demonstrated the spontaneous formation of novel RNA molecules via 3\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiester bonds. RNA recombinants appear to involve end-to-end replicase switching after initiation of minus-strand synthesis. recombination between BVDV and cellular RNAs can occur in absence of viral replicase. recombinant RNAs are formed due to switching of viral replicase among RNA templates. a variety of host factors were found to be employed by the replicase complex. many of these factors facilitate the complex assembly, but some regulate viral gene expression or recruitment of BMV RNAs to the membrane replication factories. recombination events between viral and cellular RNAs have been observed for both plant and animal RNA viruses. one example is RNA recombination between the BVDV, a member of the pestivirus genus, and cellular RNA sequences. mechanisms of crossover events with cellular RNAs remain to be elucidated. HIV-1 is capable of acquiring new genetic material, especially to the RT-encoding ORF. information about similar recombinant crosses with host RNAs in plant RNA viruses remains very limited. RNA viruses operate in the cytoplasm, as miRNAs do. there are likely structural and/or functional constrains against such snatching events. recent reverse scenario was observed. mRNA viruses were described to leave their sequences in the cellular DNA of infected hosts. the participation of RNA decay pathways in viral RNA recombination has been studied in TBSV by the Nagy group. by testing eight known endoribonucleases, the authors have shown that mutations in the components of RNase MRP debilitated the production of endoribonucleolytically cleaved TBSV RNA. the promoting role of RNAi in viral RNA recombination was reported for mycovirus infection in chestnut blight fungus cells. further studies are needed to determine the formation of viral RNA recombinants from RNAi-induced degradation products. phylogenetic surveys indicate interspecies recombination crossover's footprints in Potyviridae (Desbiez and Lecoq, 2004; Valli et al., 2007), supporting their apparent modular evolution. recombination with host RNA was also detected, likely via retrotransposable elements. coronaviruses are highly recombinogenic and natural RNA recombinant variants were described for flaviviruses. recombination is their key genetic feature maintaining the global pool of variants from which the recombination snapshots generate new recombinant forms of picornavirus. the stochastic processes contribute to the beginning of viral emergence in a new host species, followed by the adaptation phase. vectors impose strong bottlenecks during host-to-host transmissions. inaccuracies of viral RNA replication, damage from environmental factors, and attacks by RNA-modifying enzymes, are all not well understood. computer programs are used for massive comparisons of viral sequences. they can identify the recombination sites among different viral strains, different viral species, and even between the virus and the host. these programs can identify the recombination sites among different viral strains, different viral species, and even between the virus and the host. recombination systems can be used in cell-free extracts, in single-cell (protoplast) hosts, in whole plant hosts, and even in yeast. virologists can address such aspects of the RNA recombination process as the essential role of RNA sequence and structure. RNA viruses can recombine with non-replicative RNAs. recombination is a major driving force for RNA virus diversity. recombination seems to play a key role during virus speciation and emergence. the entire population of RNA variants that are present in reservoir hosts can now be determined with the tools of next-generation sequencing so that the role of recombinants can be more precisely evaluated. the frequency of RNA crossing-over varies among RNA virus species and there is little evidence that recombination was preferred by natural selection. conflict of interest statement The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
