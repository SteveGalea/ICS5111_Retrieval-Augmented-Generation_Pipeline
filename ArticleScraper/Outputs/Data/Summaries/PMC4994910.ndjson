{"summary": "the complexity of pathogens associated with these infections is a major challenge. conventional diagnostic methods such as bacterial cultures and immunological tests have the disadvantages of low sensitivity, single detection at a time, and delayed result availability. suspension array-based respiratory virus detection kit (xTAG RVP) developed by the Luminex corporation received FDA approval in 2008.13,14 this kit does not detect various common respiratory tract bacteria or atypical pathogens. the kit has not yet been used in china, where significant variation in viruses from different geographical regions contribute to inconsistent detection sensitivity. patients with definite or suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary fungal infections or non-infectious diseases were excluded. patients with definite or suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary fungal infections or non-infectious diseases were excluded. yncytial virus nucleocapsid gene (X00001), mycoplasma pneumoniae rpoB gene (KF154759), Streptococcus aureus tuf gene (HM352930), Klebsiella pneumoniae phoE gene (AF009172), Acinetobacter baumannii Oxa gene (JQ342838), Pseudomonas aeruginosa gryB gene (FJ fluA-M-R400 biontin-GGCAAGTGCACCAGCAGAATAACT FluA-F65/R400-1 NH2-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGATTTGTTTTCA Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 H5HA-R1138 biotin- CTCCCCTGCTCATTGCTATG 219 This study H5HA-F920 biotin- GCCATTCCACA 6-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTGCCTGAATAACAAGTTTAGAA Human parainfluenza virus 1 PIV1-F Biotin-CCGGTAATTTCTCATACCTATG PIV1-P 5\u2032NH2C6-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAACAT Respiratory syncytial virus, RSV-R Biotin-CTCTACCCGCTTA CGTGTCGTCCAG CP-P 5\u2032NH2C6-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGACTTTAACTTGGCGAA Staphylococcus aureus SA-F Biotin\u2013AACAGTTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. 333 subjects were hospitalized for severe acute respiratory infections at the department of Respiratory Medicine, Fujian Provincial Hospital between March 2012 and may 2015. sputum samples were collected from 293 patients and alveolar lavage fluid specimens from 40 patients. bacterial load in sputum samples (copies/ml) = template concentration (copies/l) 100/0.6.14 Sputum DNA was prepared and quantified as previously described. 15,16 Viral nucleic acids were extracted using the MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (Ver.5.0;

9 patients for N cell counts; 63 patients for lymph node, and 43 patients for C-reactive protein. 126 positive patients (37.8%) by liquid phase chip detection; 93 of these patients (73.8%) had single infections. analysis of viral infections indicated 115 positive patients (34.5%) 95 of these patients (82.6%) had single infections and 20 (17.4%) had multiple infections. no significant difference in the detection rate of atypical pathogens. the bead-based array had a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity 99.4% for viruses compared to the gold standards. the PPV was 87.2% for viruses and 99.1% for M. pneumoniae. we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the bead-based suspension array with that of real-time-PCR for eight different viruses. the bead-based suspension array test had a significantly poorer accuracy for HCMV (P 0.001) and RSV (P = 0.016) compared to real-time-PCR. 97.9% (95.7%99.2%) AD 25.0% (6.3%\u201380.6%) 99.4% (97.8%\u201399.9%) flu-A 82.4% (56.6%\u201396.2%) 97.5% (95.1%\u201398.9%) 63.6% (40.7%\u201382.8%) 99.0% (98.9%\u2013100.0%) 100.0% (2.5%\u2013100.0%) 99.7% (98.3%\u201399.9%) 115 patients (34.5%) were positive for viral infections. 10 patients (3%) were positive for M. pneumoniae. 29 (74.4%) were Gram-negative bacilli and 10 (25.6%) were Gram-positive cocci. analysis of viral infections indicated 115 positive patients (34.5%) 95 of these patients (82.6%) had single infections. 20 (17.4%) had multiple infections. bead-based suspension array detected bacteria in a significantly higher number of samples (126/333; 37.8%) compared to conventional culture (36/333: 10.8%, P 0.001). there was no significant difference in the detection rate of atypical pathogens (means only M. pneumoniae here) between the bead-based suspension array and real-time PCR (9/333 (2.7%) vs. 10/333 (3.0%) 73.1% (63.5%\u201381.3%) 70% (34.8%\u201393.3%) Specificity (95% CI) NA 83.0 (77.5%\u201387.6%) 99.4% (97.8%\u201399.9%) PPV (95% CI) NA 66.1% (56.7%\u201374.7%) 77.8% (40.0%\u201397.2%) NPV (95% CI) NA 87.2%.
