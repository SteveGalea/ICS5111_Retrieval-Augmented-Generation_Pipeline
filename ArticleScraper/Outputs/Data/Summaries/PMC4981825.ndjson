{"summary": "twenty flocks were sampled for IBV detection using RRT-PCR and isolation of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks during the period from 2010 to 2015. the chicks were divided into 4 groups 10 birds each including the negative control group. variant subgroup (Egy/Var-I) was likely resembling the original Egyptian variant strain (Egypt/Beni-Suif/01) and the Israeli strain (IS/1494/2006) the second subgroup (Egy/Var-I) included the viruses circulating in the Middle East (Ck/EG/BSU-2 and Ck/EG/BSU-3/2011) and the Israeli strain (IS/885/00) pathogenicity the phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N), the membrane protein (M), the spike (S) glycoprotein and the small membrane protein (E) the S1 subunit is proteolitically cleaved into 2 separate subunits. the S1 subunit is attached to the viral envelope and is responsible for fusion of virus envelope and the host cell membrane. the chickens were vaccinated with H120 strain of IBV at one day of age. chickens showed respiratory symptoms such as gasping, coughing, sneezing and tracheal rales.

RESULTS Virus screening and isolation Samples representing the twenty flocks showed positive results for detection of IBV using rRT-PCR. virus isolates, numbers from 5-10, were found to be related to Egy/Var-I. they were very close to both the ancestral Egyptian virus (Egypt/Beni-Suef/01, Genbank accession number JX174183.1) and other viruses of Egy/Var-I available in the GenBank, also to IBV-IS-1494-06. they share amino acid identities from 96% to 100% with each other (Table 2). 87 87 87 63 90 63 66 84 70 67 IBV-IS-1494-06-S1 99 98 94 91 87 87 87 87 87 63 90 63 66 84 71 68 IBV-isolate-IS-885-S1 90 88 90 90 86 86 86 63 63 89 62 65 83 69 69 QXIBV 86 85 86 84 85 85 63 83 80 80 80 81 83 81 82 78 87 IBV: Infectious bronchitis virus. alignment analysis of the S1-HVR3 for both nucleotide and deduced amino acid was performed. compared with previously published reference and vaccine IBV strains used in the field. severity of the signs increases in group 1 (Egy/Var-I) than group 2 (Egy/Var-I); however, for group 3 (classic strain) only mild respiratory signs were observed. mortalities were 50%, 40%, and 10% and recorded clinical scores were 3, 2 and 1 in the three groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

Usually IBV serotypes have a wide range of genetic variations in the S1 gene ranged from 2% to 25%. the first subgroup of Egy/Var-I, represented by 6 viruses, is very close to the original Egyptian strain Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 and to Ck/EG/BSU-1,4,5/2011 isolated in 2011[16]. in this work, viruses of Egy/Var-I subgroup were also found to be closely related to IS/1494/2006 with 96%-97% amino acid identity. the three IBV strains (IBV-Eg/1212B-2012 of Egy/Var-II, IBV-EG/IBV1-2011 of classic Mass-like genotype) were able to induce respiratory signs post-inoculation with clinical scores of 3, 2 and 1. it is well known that the most severe clinical symptoms of IBV appear in very young chicks. vaccine strains induced lesions in chickens, but mortality did not exceed 10%. trachea, lung and kidney were collected from infected birds after intra-nasal inoculation. IBV nucleic acids were detected more frequently in tracheal tissues than in the lungs, and kidney. tracheal mucosa, irregular loss of epithelium, desquamation of epithelium in the tracheal lumen, goblet cell activation and focal aggregation. two groups of variants are co-circulating in Egypt with high mortality in SPF chicks. epidemiological surveillance studies are needed to explain the mechanism of emergence of variants and their biological properties. the high genetic variation between these variants and the widely used IBV vaccine reveal that the antigenic drift is likely to occur under the long-term immune pressure. this work focus on the high mortality caused by the variant strains of IBV in the poultry flocks.
