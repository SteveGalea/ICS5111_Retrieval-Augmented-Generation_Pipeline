{"summary": "influenza viruses were collected from all 47 prefectures in Japan for this study. 1,734 samples of influenza A (H1N1) were isolated during the 2007\u201308 season (September 2007\u2013August 2008) and 1,482 samples of influenza A (H1N1) were isolated in the 2008\u201309 season (September 2008\u2013April 2009) the final drug concentration ranged from 0.03 nmol/L to 6,500 nmol/L for oseltamivir and from 0.03 nmol/L to 12,500 nmol/L for zanamivir. HI test was performed to evaluate the reactivity of ferret antiserum against 2008\u201309 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009. influenza viruses were collected from all 47 prefectures in Japan for this study. 1,734 samples of influenza A (H1N1) were isolated during the 2007\u201308 season. influenza viruses A (H1N1) were subjected to full or partial (nt 615\u20131076) NA sequencing to detect H275Y substitution on the N1 NA protein. drug concentrations required to inhibit NA activity by 50% (IC50) were calculated by a 4-parameter method using microWin 2000 version 4 software (Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH, Overath, Germany). HI test was performed to evaluate the reactivity of ferret antiserum against 2008\u201309 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009. in the 2007\u201308 season, 45 viruses possessing H275Y mutation (total frequency of ORVs 2.6%; Figure 2, panel A) were observed in 10 prefectures. 22 of 68 influenza viruses A (H1N1) tested possessed H275Y, showing a markedly higher frequency (32.4%) than that in other prefectures. most ORVs with H275Y belong to clade 2B, which can be further divided into 2 distinct lineages by an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at aa 354. in the 2007\u201308 season, of 45 ORVs, 1 virus (A/Yokohama/91/2007) isolated in November 2007 belonged to clade 2C. in the 2008\u201309 season, all ORVs belonged to the northern-eu lineage. the NA gene of ORVs from Japan was close to that of ORVs isolated from countries in Europe. ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii. ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii. neuraminidase inhibition assay for zanamivir showed a mean IC50 SD of 0.10 0.05 nmol/L (range 0.01\u20130.35 nmol/L), and ORVs had a mean SD of 0.01\u20130.35 nmol/L. of 67.7 44.1 nmol/L (range 26.1\u2013239.2 nmol/L), showing a reduction of >260-fold in susceptibility to oseltamivir. one OSV identified as a statistical outlier showed a D151E substitution on the NA protein. oseltamivir-resistant viruses with H275Y were excluded from overall population in statistical analysis. oseltamivir-resistant viruses with H275Y were excluded from overall population. the IC50 values of most viruses with D151D/G tend to be higher than mean IC50 values but do not exceed the cutoff value. 341 viruses were regarded as the zanamivir-sensitive viruses with a mean SD IC50 of 0.40 0.26 nmol/L. original clinical specimens of viruses with D151 variation were subjected to NA sequencing, so that all D151 variations (D151G/E/N) were not detected in the original clinical specimens. we thus concluded that D151 variants might not have emerged as a natural occurrence and all recent ORVs would retain sensitivity to zanamivir. antigenic characterization of oseltamivir-resistant and oseltamivir-sensitive influenza virus A (H1N1), Japan, 2007\u20132009. despite a low frequency of only 2.6% in Japan during 2007\u201308 season, an unexpectedly high frequency (32.4%) of ORVs was observed in Tottori prefecture. ORVs formed 3 subclades: T-1, sharing V75A and D354G; T-2, without common changes; and T-3, sharing M188L. the sampling month for each ORV is indicated by a triangle (January), circle (February), or square (March). only OSVs genetically close to ORVs were observed in T-2. all ORVs from Tottori seemed to have been eliminated in the 2007\u201308 season. all ORVs from Tottori seemed to have been eliminated in the 2007\u201308 season. in the 2007\u201308 season, 45 viruses possessing H275Y mutation were observed in 10 prefectures. 2.4%) of ORVs was observed in Tottori prefecture (A) total frequency was 99.7% (1,477/1,482) during the 2008\u201309 season. most influenza viruses A (H1N1) during 2007\u201308 fell into either clade 2B. most ORVs with H275Y belong to clade 2B. ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii. ORVs in C-1, representing most influenza viruses A (H1N1) from the 2008\u201309 season in Japan, and ORVs in C-4 were close to ORVs isolated from South Africa and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. antiviral drug susceptibility Of the 364 viruses tested by NA inhibition assay, 101 possessed a H275Y substitution. some viruses generated 2 types of unusual sigmoid curves (Figure 3, panels A and B) resulting from the mixed population of NAI-resistant and -sensitive viruses. OSVs showed a mean IC50 SD of 0.10 0.05 nmol/L (range 0.01\u20130.35 nmol/L) ORVs had a mean SD IC50 of 67.7 44.1 nmol/L (range 26.1\u2013239.2 nmol/L), showing a reduction of >260-fold in susceptibility to oseltamivir. 14.80 A/YOKOHAMA/75/2007 D/G H Q NA Type A 0.13 6.53 A/HAMAMATSU/33/2008 D/G H Q NA Type A 0.13 6.15 A/TOCHIGI/30/2008 D/G H Q NA Type A 0.13 4.32 A/YOKOHAMA/74/2007 D/G H Q NA Type A 0.12 2.81 A/HIROSHIMA/92/2007 D/G H Q NA Type B 0.07 NA A/MIE mean of sensitive viruses 0.10 0.05 0.40 0.26 Cutoff IC50 values 0.40 1.99 *IC50, drug concentrations required to inhibit neurominidase activity by 50%; UQ, upper quartile; IQR, interquartile range; NA, not available. zanamivir-resistant viruses with H275Y were excluded from overall population. IC50 (41.89 nmol/L) and 19 of the other 22 viruses displayed an amino acid change G, N, or V at the D151 position (Table 1). these data suggest that D151 changes have a substantial effect on sensitivity to zanamivir (and oseltamivir) a recent study reported that a D151E change was detected only after virus propagation in cell culture, but not in the original clinical specimen (19) OSVs and ORVs were anitigenitically indistinguishable from each other. only 2% and 3% of OSVs showed a >8-fold reduction in HI titer to the homologous titer. ORVs from Tottori were collected from 4 cities over 2 areas. the sampling month for each ORV is indicated by a triangle (January), circle (February), or square (March). only OSVs genetically close to ORVs were observed in T-2. genetically diverse ORVs belonging to the northern-eu lineage were cocirculating only in Tottori city in the eastern area. all ORVs from Tottori seemed to have been eliminated in the 2007\u201308 season, and ORVs that may have been introduced from other counties were circulating during 2008\u201309 in Japan. a low frequency of NAI-resistant viruses for any strains and subtypes (10,21,22) suggests that NAI-resistant viruses would become defective viruses with attenuated infectivity and transmissibility to human. despite little NAI use, a high emergence of ORVs has been detected in several countries in Europe since November 2007. ORVs in C-2 and C-3 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated in North America and Hawaii. the collection month of ORVs in C-3 were similar to each other. the ORVs obtained during 2008\u201309 were not genetically similar to any ORVs isolated in Tottori during 2007\u201308. almost all Japanese ORVs belonging to clade 2B retained sensitive genotype to M2 inhibitors. previous reports that recent clade 2B viruses are sensitive to M2 inhibitors, but clade 2C viruses are resistant (27). clade 2C viruses are resistant to both NAIs. oseltamivir-resistant viruses (ORVs) with H275Y belong to clade 2B. northern-EU lineage sharing 354G (pink shading) and Hawaii lineage sharing 354D."}
