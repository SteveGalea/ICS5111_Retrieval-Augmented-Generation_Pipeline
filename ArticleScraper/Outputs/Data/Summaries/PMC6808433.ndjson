{"summary": "canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), also known as kennel cough complex, is composed of bacterial and viral agents associated with low mortality but high prevalence. canine distemper and Strep zoo, though less prevalent than the others in the complex, can be associated with significant loss of life in a crowded shelter. an environmental stressor triggers the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin. the release of the latter hormone stimulates the production of corticosterone or cortisol from the adrenal cortex into the blood stream. cortisol levels negatively correlate with the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) in dogs[15]. rhesus macaques that were high in the sociability trait showed a more rapid decrease in plasma cortisol concentrations, a higher IgG response, and a lower viral load when challenged with a simian immunodeficiency virus. pigs that spent more time struggling were found to have a higher concentration of cortisol and lower immune function[19]. researchers assessed 28 dogs for one month at the animal shelter. the behavior of the dogs was assessed using standardized personality tests. the complex \u201cboldness\u201d trait was statistically derived from scores from several other tested traits (e.g. activity, attentiveness, dominance, and sociability) the kennels contained a water and food bowl. staff cleaned the kennels and fed the dogs daily. the last row of kennels was used for aggressive, pregnant or injured dogs. data collection Dogs were enrolled in the study the day after they arrived at the shelter. the dogs were videotaped in their kennel for 1 min using a Kodak PIXPRO SPZ1. the behaviors during the videos were coded at a later time. the presence of coughing and sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge were noted during approximately 1 min observations of the dog in the kennel. on few occasions, the dog was too sick or distraught to exit their kennel; in that case the health assessment occurred inside the kennel. the dogs were fed dog treats (Pup-Peroni\u00ae Dog Snacks, Big Heart Pet Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) on 22.6% of observations, the two observers collected data independently to calculate inter-observer agreement. the inter-observer agreement was calculated for each behavior independently by dividing by the sum of agreements and disagreements. the average agreement across behaviors was 99% (SD = 0.01%; min: 95% for \u201cleaning on wall,\u201d max: 100% for \u201cout of sight,\u201d \u201cchasing tail,\u201d \u201clying down,\u201d \u201ccowering,\u201d \u201ctucking tail,\u201d and \u201cleg lift\u201d). body Pawing at door One front paw makes contact with the cage door Cowering Body in a lowered, crouched position Wagging tail Tail moves perpendicular to the dog\u2019s body Tucking tail Tail held still and tightly between hind legs, may be curled under genital area or ventral side Barking Vocalization of very short duration. the researcher videotaped the dog through the window for 2 min. the second component of the test included the researcher kneeling in the center of the 1m x 1m square for 3 min. the third part of the test involved the placement of a clear plastic tub. Behavior Operational Definition Standing Supported with all four legs Sitting Supported by two extended front legs and two flexed back legs Lying down Lying down with limbs either tucked under or placed in front of body Walking Dog is walking (4-gait movement) twenty dogs did not urinate when taken outside, resulting in 64 dogs containing urinary C:C data. urine was shipped, in dry ice, to an independent Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (College Station, TX, USA) we restricted our analysis to use the behavioral variables from the first two observation days to predict health observations across the 14 study days. only 56 behavioral variables remained for exploration. path analysis was performed using the plspm package in R[32] hekman and colleagues previously found panting and lip licking were positively correlated with salivary cortisol concentrations, indicating stress[37]. thus, we included \u201cpanting\u201d and \u201clicking self\u201d into the \u201canxiety\u201d latent variable. however, we recognize that this was a subjective decision.

Trotting Dog is galloping (3-gait movement) Near door frame Any part of dog is arm's length (1m) or closer away from door Leaning on fence Any art of the body in contact with fence or wall Jump on glass At least one paw is on glass wall Barking Vocalization of very short duration and low frequency Whining A cyclic vocalization Howling Prolonged high-amplitude vocalization of varying pitch. twenty dogs did not urinate when taken outside, resulting in 64 dogs containing urinary C:C data. urine was shipped to an independent Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. the coded behaviors were categorized into latent variables by the first author based on previous research by Hennessy et al. each behavioral indicator variable was included as a reflective indicator of the latent variable. aning on the wall has previously been found to correlate with a long length of stay at the shelter[29], which may indicate some form of distress. we elected to place this behavior into the \u201canxiety\u201d latent variable. however, we recognize that this was a subjective decision.

Fig 2 shows the change in the health observation scores across time. temperature increased indicative of fever. dotted line indicates the threshold for fever (39\u00b0C) the final Cronbach\u2019s alpha and Dillon-Goldstein\u2019s Rho were retained in the final model. 21 variables with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha and Dillon-Goldstein\u2019s Rho.5 were retained in the final model. Sociability, Curiosity and Time in the shelter were significantly associated with illness. as time in the shelter increased, illness scores did also (estimate =.53, p.001). Fig 5) and Curiosity (estimate =.09, p =.026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and Anxiety, however, were not associated with illness. in the shelter as fixed effects indicated that the C:C ratio was not associated the illness score, although time in the shelter was (see Table 10). a correlation matrix was constructed with C:C ratio, time at the shelter, standardized illness, Sociability, and Curiosity scores. standardized Curiosity and illness scores had a moderate correlation with the standardized illness score of.35. no correlation was present between Sociability and time in the shelter, Curiosity and time in the shelter, and C:C ratio and illness score. these results clearly indicate the development of illness and systematic increase in severity across the study period. the nose and eye condition and coughing as a factor of days spent in the shelter. the final Cronbach\u2019s alpha and Dillon-Goldstein\u2019s Rho for each retained variable are shown in Table 7 and Table 8. latent variable loadings. Fig 4 shows the hypothesized path model with regression coefficients. overall, Sociability, Curiosity and Time in the shelter were significantly associated with illness. Activity and Anxiety, however, were not associated with illness.
