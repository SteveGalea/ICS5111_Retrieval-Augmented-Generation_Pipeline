{"summary": "sequencing enables massively parallel determination of nucleotide order within genetic material. sequences generated by these instruments are almost always considerably shorter in length than the genomic regions studied. computational methods play a vital role in assembly of short reads. a major challenge in working with NGS data from metagenomic studies is the high levels of diversity present, particularly for the virus genetic material. the ability to run analyses in the field on portable computer systems without internet connectivity is also important. many transformation approaches can be applied to sequences of nucleotides [23] or amino acids [24] due to the ordered nature of genetic data. many of these transformation approaches can be applied to sequences of nucleotides [23] or amino acids [24]. the physiochemical properties of amino acids represent sequences for fast matching of homologous sequence regions for alignment. the R*-tree [32,33] and KD-tree [34] indexing structures are very accurate for low dimensional datasets. their performance deteriorates significantly in high dimensional space [31], a phenomenon known as the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019 [35,36]. values v1...v5 correspond to the numerical value or numerical vector associated with each nucleotide. other methods, such as the electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials (EIIP) [40] and the atomic representation approach [41], do not introduce internucleotide mathematical bias. 0.0806, T = 0.1335, N = 0 Atomic A = 70, C = 58, G = 78, T = 66, N = 0 Pair A o r T = 1, C o r G = 1, N = 0 Complex number A = 1 + 1 i, C = 1 + 1 i, G = 1 1 i, G = 1 1 i, N = 0 + 0 i DNA Walk A = [ 1, 0 ], C = the lower bounding property guarantees that if two data points are nearby in their original space, they will remain so in their transformed/approximate space. we employ the DFT and the DWT transformation methods and the PAA approximation method as they satisfy the above requirements. the DWT transforms data into the time-frequency domain, capturing both frequency and temporal location information. a numerical sequence is divided into n equally sized windows, the mean values of which together form a compressed sequence representation [20,21]. the selection of n determines the resolution of the compressed or approximate representation. the k data points closest to a query q are the k-nearest neighbours to the query q. 2.4. a k-NN-search returns the data points closest to the query q. the best matches for our short reads\u2019 transformations were identified using a k-NN search approach on the VP-tree. the results obtained from the k-NN search were re-evaluated in the original space to remove potential false positive results. reads generated using 5 norovirus, 5 Ebola and 5 Respiratory syncytial virus genomes are deposited on GitHub. table 2 contains detailed information about the simulated datasets. each row contains details for each simulated dataset. 2133 CuReSim HIV HXB2 K03455 1.0 1.0 2.0 2133 CuReSim HIV HXB2 K03455 1.5 1.5 3.0 2133 CuReSim HIV HXB2 K03455 2.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 2133 CuReSim HIV HXB2 K03455 2.5 2.5 5.0 2133 CuReSim mixed Viruses: Caliciviridae, Filoviridae, Pneumoviridae Norovirus 15 publicly available real virus datasets were used for the evaluation of our methodology. the real datasets comprise 5 norovirus, 5 Ebola virus and 5 human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) short read datasets. SRA and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) can be found in Table 3. Rows contain information for each real reads\u2019 dataset (i.e., virus family, virus, genome strain GenBank ID, SRA project ID, number of reads and technology used to sequence data). the norovirus genome KM198509, the Ebola virus genome KM034562 and the RSV genome KP317934 were used as a reference index to align and/or run the taxonomic classification analysis for the mixed virus datasets. all reference genomes used in this study are available from the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) iciviridae ebolavirus KM198509.1 7425 Filoviridae ebolavirus KM034562.1 18957 Pneumoviridae Human orthopneumovirus (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) KP317934.1 15233 2.6. classification and alignment tool can be quantified in terms of the F-measure [48]. Depending on the chosen numerical representation, each nucleotide is associated with a specific numerical value or vector. the specific values are assigned to the position of each nucleotide indicating the presence of a nucleotide at each sequence position. values v1...v5 correspond to the numerical value or numerical vector associated with each nucleotide. G = 0.5, T = 1.5, N = 0.0 EIIP A = 0.1260, C = 0.1340, G = 0.0806, T = 0.1335, N = 0 Atomic A = 70, C = 58, G = 78, T = 66, N = 0 Pair A o r T = 1, C o r G = 1, N = 0 Complex number A = 1 + 1 i, C = 1 + 1 i, G = 1 1 transforming/approximating sequential data should: (i) accurately transform/approximate data without loss of useful information, (ii) have low computational overheads, (iii) facilitate rapid comparison of data and (iv) provide lower bounding. the distance between data representations is always less than or equal to that of the original data. the DWT transforms data into the time-frequency domain, capturing both frequency and temporal location information. a numerical sequence is divided into n equally sized windows, the mean values of which together form a compressed sequence representation [20,21] unlike the DWT, PAA is irreversible, meaning that the original sequence cannot be recovered from the approximation. a data point to use as a vantage point is selected (either randomly or by applying some heuristic to find and use the furthest point in the dataset [37]) the rest of the data points are partitioned into two nodes based on their distance to that point. the resulting indexing structure can then be used for fast identification of a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN-search) the best matches for our short reads\u2019 transformations were identified using a k-NN search approach on the VP-tree. results obtained from the k-NN search were re-evaluated in the original space to remove potential false positive results.

Plot 8-(ii) illustrates the F-measures obtained for each aligner on the Norovirus sequences data. ALBN provided the most accurate results in all scenarios tested. all k-mers\u2019 transformations were used to build a VP-tree. information from the data comparison was used to construct a weighted graph. the shortest path on the weighted graph was identified with a breadth-first search (BFS) k-mer lengths 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 for the HXB2 simulated reads and 50, 100 and 150 for the mixed virus datasets. the derived contigs from each assembler were evaluated against the reference genomes used to generate the data simulations with BLASTn [54] BLASTn was used to align all contigs to an HIV-1 HXB2 reference genome. the y-axis indicates the number of gaps and mismatches that exist in the contigs obtained for each tool. the x-axis depicts the length of the genome the reported contigs cover. Plots 11-i to 11-iv illustrate results obtained from all assemblers on data with 0%, 3%, 10% and 20% variation levels accordingly. ASBN processes data and assembles short reads in a lower dimensional space. in all cases, ASBN generated contigs spanning the whole genomes of their respective viral species. the first output was a text file providing detailed information on all of the classification matches generated for each read. each line contained the name of the read, the number of classifications generated for that particular read, the highest classification score obtained, the name of the reference, which provided the highest classification score. both BLASTn and Kaiju were evaluated using their default parameters. Plot 3-ii illustrates the F-measures obtained for each classifier on simulations with 0% to 5% of substitution variation rate. plot 3-iii illustrates the F-measures obtained for each tool on simulations of uniform 0% to 10% insertion/deletion and substitution variation. CBN outperformed BLASTn in most cases, falling behind in terms of accuracy only on datasets with high variation rates. BLASTn correctly assigned the most species, followed closely by Kaiju and BLASTn. simulated reads and 50, 100 and 150 for mixed virus and real datasets. DWT variant tested cases of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 wavelets. each aligner\u2019s accuracy was quantified in terms of the F-measure. plot 6-(iii) illustrates the F-measures obtained for each aligner on the mixed virus simulations. y-axis indicates the F-measure score, and the x-axis depicts the reads data files. plot depicts the F-measures obtained for each aligner on the Norovirus sequences data. reads were aligned to reference strains related to those used to generate the dataset. GraphMap and BWA-MEM were third and fourth in terms of accuracy. reads were aligned to species-specific reference genomes. the smallest distance between every possible k-mer can be obtained by either using a sliding window approach or break reads every possible subsequence with length k. the shortest path in the graph is identified with a breadth-first search algorithm (red coloured edges) thereby (C) enabling read alignment. the contigs obtained from the assembly of the HIV-1 HXB2 simulated short read data were evaluated against the K03455 genome. the contigs obtained from the mixed virus datasets were evaluated against the K03455 genome. BLASTn was used to align all contigs to an HIV-1 HXB2 reference genome and determine genome coverage. the contigs obtained for each assembler were evaluated against the reference genome that was used to generate the simulated data. BLASTn was used to align all contigs to an HIV-1 HXB2 reference genome. the x-axis indicates the number of gaps and mismatches that exist in the contigs obtained for each tool. our results show that this approach permits accurate classification of de novo assembly and reference alignment in spite of high rates of sequence variation or the use of a divergent reference genome. this allows sequence comparison exploiting the major characteristics of the data and enabling the identification of similarities that might otherwise be concealed by minor variation or sequencing error/noise. assembly of large genomes remains a formidable problem in computing. implementing a reference-based aligner and de novo assembler is a versatile approach for reconstructing genomes and metagenomes sequenced with short reads. a relatively high error rate still limits the scope of downstream analyses. nucleotide sequences can be effectively represented as numerical series. by applying established signal decomposition methods, compressed representations of nucleotide sequences can be created."}
