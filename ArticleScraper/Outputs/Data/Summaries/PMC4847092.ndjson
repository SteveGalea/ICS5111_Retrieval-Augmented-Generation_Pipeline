{"summary": "silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been proven to be the most effective antimicrobial agents against bacteria and viruses. they show antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus [1,4,5,6], hepatitis B virus [7], herpes simplex virus type 1 [8], monkey poxvirus [10], Tacaribe virus [11], and H1N1 influenza A virus [12,13,14]. the most effective size of Ag NPs is 10 nm [14] and a spherical shape superior to a tubular shape or aggregation. previous studies have found that capping agents limiting the release of free Ag NPs would exhibit lower viral inhibition. GO is employed in the production of graphene family nanomaterials for various applications. the GO-Ag matrix is highly dispersible in water, contains a large specific surface area, shows excellent bactericidal activity at extremely low concentrations. the GO-Ag matrix is highly dispersible in water, contains a large specific surface area, shows excellent bactericidal activity at extremely low concentrations, and exhibits no corrosive characteristics. GO powders were re-dispersed in water, and the solution was sonicated for 2 h. the solution was sonicated for 2 h to facilitate the exfoliation of stacked GO into monolayer or multilayered GO sheets. the GO powders were further reduced using beta-mercaptoethanol. crystalline of GO and chemical composition were carried out via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan, XRD-6000, Cu-K radiation, = 0.154 nm) the thickness and layer number of GO were scanned and analyzed with an atomic force microscope. DF-1 cell is an immortalized cell line of chicken embryo fibroblasts. it can support the growth of several avian viruses including IBDV. fcwf-4 cells were propagated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. the infectivity of viruses was calculated as followed: infectivity % = (number of wells with virus-infected cells/number of wells with virus-inoculated cells) 100%. the virus dilution can infect 50% of cells. the minimum inhibitory concentration is the lowest concentration of GO or GO-Ag can inhibit the infection completely after serial dilutions. the assays measured cellular metabolic activity via NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes and reflect the number of viable cells present. graphite powder and sodium nitrate were mixed with sulfuric acid in an ice bath with agitation for 4 h. potassium manganate was added under stirring and the mixture was kept at 35 \u00b0C for 2 h. after the mixture turned yellow with stirring, the mixture was centrifuged to obtain GO powders. GO-Ag and the distribution of Ag particles on GO sheets were observed by using high-resolution transmission (HR-TEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan, 40 kV, JEM-2100) the sample was placed on 300-mesh copper grids for HR-TEM and embedded in a copper paste for FE-SEM. crystalline of GO and chemical composition were carried out via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan, XRD fetus-4 cells for FCoV [21] and DF-1 cells for IBDV were maintained in DMEM. DF-1 cell is an immortalized cell line of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) it can support the growth of several avian viruses including IBDV [22] the infectivity of viruses was determined by observing the formation of CPE and the staining of viable cells by 1% crystal violet. the cells stained with 1% crystal violet were not infected by viruses. by using the infectivity percentages, the virus dilution can infect 50% of cells. inhibition efficacy was calculated as followed: inhibition % = (log10 (TCID50/mL of virus-only group))/log10 (TCID50/mL of virus-only group) 100%. minimum inhibitory concentration is lowest concentration of GO or OG-Ag can inhibit the infection completely after serial dilutions. p-values of 0.05 were regarded as statistically significance. results 3.1. Characterization of GO and GO-Ag. final product is black powder and needs to be re-suspended in PBS or cell growth media. iffraction peak from 24\u00b0 to 29\u00b0 indicates that the sample was poorly ordered along the stacking direction. the XPS patterns in Figure 4 showed that the O/C ratio of GO is 0.326 and also confirmed that Ag nanoparticles are deposited on GO. GO-Ag showed significantly more cytotoxicity than GO (p 0.05) after 1 h and 24 h of incubation. CC50 of GO and GO-Ag was over 6.25 mg/mL and 5.6 mg/mL in DF-1 cells. f-4) cells without virus become multinucleated giant cells at 24 h, 100. DF-1 cells infected with IBDV have granulation around nuclei, cell rounding, and detachment at 72 h, 100. GO and GO-Ag showed concentration-dependent activity to inhibit the infection of FCoV. the infection of 9 103 TCID50/mL IBDV was higher than 1 mg/mL against the infection of 9 103 TCID50/mL IBDV in DF-1 cells. inhibition % = (log10 (TCID50/mL of virus) log10 (TCID50/mL of treatment))/log10 (TCID50/mL of virus) 100%. IBDV: 9 102 TCID50/mL IBDV + GO 100% 100% 100% IBDV + GO-Ag 0% 0% 0% 37.5% Infectivity % = (number of wells with virus-infected cells/number of wells with virus-inoculated cells) 100%; GO: graphene oxide; GO-Ag: graphene oxide with Ag particles; N.A.: no available. the XRD pattern of GO shown in Figure 3 revealed a broad diffraction peak from 24\u00b0 to 29\u00b0. the pattern suggests that the GO sheets were reduced, and some oxygen-containing functional groups were removed. the XPS patterns in Figure 4 showed that the O/C ratio of GO is 0.326. the CC50 of GO and GO-Ag was less than 1.5625 mg/mL. the cell viability was more than 90% after 1 h and 24 h of incubation. at a concentration of 6.25 and 3.125 mg/mL, GO-Ag showed significantly more cytotoxicity than GO (p 0.05) fcwf-4 cells infected with IBDV have granulation around nuclei, cell rounding, and detachment at 72 h, 100. GO and GO-Ag showed concentration-dependent activity to inhibit the infection of FCoV better than GO. with 1 mg/mL of Go-Ag, 22.7% of infection by 9 105 TCID50/mL of IBDV in DF-1 cells was inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentration of GO-Ag was 0.125 mg/mL against the infection of 9 102 TCID50/mL IBDV. infectivity of viruses inoculated with graphene oxide with silver. concentration 1 0.5 0.25 0.125 0.0625 IBDV + GO 100% 100% N.A. no studies have discussed the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. g against coronavirus (47,000 TCID50/mL) was observed, compared to 97% of inhibition against influenza virus (100 TCID50/mL) by Ag NPs (0.05 mg/mL) in Xiang\u2019s study [14] is not much better than that of GO-Ag in this study. no studies have been done on the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. silver particles anchored on graphene oxide sheets (GO-Ag) can inhibit the infectivity of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses without any antiviral ability. silver particles exhibited antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. graphene oxide sheets could inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses without a lipid envelope. the conjugation between the sulfur groups of viral proteins and the silver particles on the surface of graphene oxide could be important."}
