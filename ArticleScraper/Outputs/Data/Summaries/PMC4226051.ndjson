{"summary": "Scientific Knowledge on the Subject Respiratory syncytial virus infection is known to increase pneumococcal infection but it is unclear how this occurs. the result of the binding together is that the genes for pneumococcal virulence are up-regulated. the results of the binding together is that the genes for pneumococcal virulence are up-regulated. virulent in in vivo (12) and ex vivo studies with ciliated epithelia (13, 14) ciliated epithelium was obtained from nine healthy control subjects who had no history of respiratory disease. none of the subjects had a symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection in the preceding 6 weeks. the concentration of airway inflammation markers in the airway surface liquid was measured as before (19\u201321) using a 96-well multispot assay. chemokines were measured using a human Th1/Th2 standard 10-spot plate. all antibody incubations were performed for 2 hours, followed by three washes with PBS. bacteria were cytospun at 2,000 g for 5 minutes, air dried on a clean microscope slide and mounted under coverslips in 80% glycerol, 3% n-propylgallate (in PBS) mounting medium. Binding of antibodies to bacteria was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (1/5,000; Sigma) and 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in 1 M diethanolamine pH 9.8, 0.5 M MgCl2. absorbance read at 405 nm after 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop) at 280 nm. half of the gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie for protein sequencing. the other half was blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 1 hour. cDNA synthesis, labeling with dyes (Cy3 and Cy5), hybridization, and scanning were performed as described (23, 24) for identification of differentially expressed genes a Bayesian P value less than 0.001 and fold change cut-off of 2 was applied. e and inoculated intranasally with 1 106 to 5 106 cfu/50 l pneumococci. one group of mice was inoculated intranasally with 5 104 pfu/50 l RSV A2 alone in PBS. three mice from each group were killed by cervical dislocation. 105 pfu/ml were collected in bronchial epithelial basal medium. the strain was chosen because it is a well-characterized strain. we have previously shown it to be virulent in in vivo studies with ciliated epithelia. bacteria were resuspended in RNAlater (Sigma) and stored at 80\u00b0C. concentration of airway inflammation markers in the airway surface liquid was measured as before (19\u201321) using a 96-well multispot assay. rabbit antipneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (16745; 40 g/ml; Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) and goat anti-RSV conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (ab20391; 40 g/ml; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) all antibody incubations were performed for 2 hours, followed by three washes with PBS. bacteria were cytospun at 2,000 g for 5 the plates were washed three times as before and 100 l of anticapsular antibody (1 g/ml) added to the well for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. absorbance was read at 405 nm after 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. the membrane and cytoplasmic proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 10 minutes using a Beckman TL-100. equal concentration of protein extracts were boiled and separated by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel at 50 mA constant. half of the gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie for protein sequencing and the other half was blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 1 hour at three biologic replicates of each treatment were performed in medium (BEBM) cells were harvested for RNA isolation after the 2 hours of treatment. all other procedures regarding cell disruption, RNA isolation, RNA quality testing, cDNA synthesis, labeling with dyes (Cy3 and Cy5), hybridization, and scanning were performed as described. neumonia Model Groups of 10 outbred pathogen-free female mice (9-wk old) strain MF1 were anesthetized using isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 1 106 to 5 106 cfu/50 l pneumococci. this dose was previously shown not to cause disease in naive mice (100% survival at 7 d postinfection) this follows the time course of secondary bacterial infection following RSV infection (10, 30) results showed that S. pneumoniae adhered to the ciliated epithelium in greater numbers (Figure 1A) and increased (P 0.05) the degree of ciliary dyskinesia (Figure 1B) in ciliated cultures pretreated with RSV compared with mock-infected (control) cultures. the fold changes in gene expression were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. the internal control gene was gyrB and the reference condition was pneumococci exposed to naive respiratory epithelial cells obtained from the same donor. the increase in CXCL8 is of particular interest because this chemokine is responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils into the airways of patients infected with RSV. this compares with a threefold increase following pneumococcal infection alone (98 pg/ml; P > 0.05), and a fivefold increase following RSV infection alone (159 pg/ml; P > 0.05). analysis showed five out of the six genes studied were expressed at a higher level compared with pneumococci exposed to mock-infected epithelium. the low quantity of bacterial RNA recovered restricted the number of genes we could study. expression of neuraminidase B (nanB), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase (nox) and competence-stimulating peptide (comX) genes was also higher than detected in pneumococci exposed to mock-infected ciliated epithelium. SV G protein bound to a single pneumococcal protein with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kD. mass spectrometry detected only pneumococcal penicillin-binding protein 1a (PBP1a) the peptides covered 43% of a 79.7-kD protein that showed a greater than 99% match probability to the S. pneumoniae PBP1A protein. the protein sequencing was performed as described in Methods in the online supplement from two individual sequencings. the genes are grouped into cluster of orthologous groups based on the putative functions of corresponding proteins. in total, expression of 157 genes were altered of which 99 were up-regulated and 58 were down-regulated in response to RSV G protein treatment. of particular note was the significant up-regulation of the pneumolysin (ply) gene because the toxin it encodes has been shown to be critical for the development of invasive pneumococcal disease. control pneumococci after 6 hours showed the bacteria had replicated to similar levels (P > 0.05) this suggests that enhanced virulence was not a property of increased bacterial replication in the lungs. mice receiving sequential infection by RSV then pneumococci had significantly greater inflammation and high levels of accumulated neutrophils compared with mice inoculated with each pathogen separately (10). thelial Cells Alter the Pneumococcal and Host Response to Infection We investigated whether pneumococcal virulence is altered during its interaction with human ciliated epithelial cells. this system closely resembles the physiologic conditions of the nasopharynx, which is a natural environment for pneumococcal-RSV interactions. data were collected from seven independent experiments. cells were infected with RSV, mock infected followed by pneumococci. control cells were treated with bovine serum albumin alone. coinfection also enhanced the inflammatory response of the ciliated epithelium. the addition of pneumococci to RSV-infected cells led to significant (P 0.05) increases in levels of tumor necrosis factor-, IL-5, IL-13, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22. Pneumococcus IFN- 12 (10\u201315) 20 (15\u201320) 17 (14\u201325) 20 (19\u201325) IL-1 2 (2\u20134) 4 (3\u20134) 6 (5\u201312) 5 (4\u20136) IL-12p70 2 (2\u20132) 3 (3\u20134) 2 (2\u20133) 4 (3\u20134) TNF- 7 (6\u20138) 10 (10\u201315) 12 (9\u201319) 19 (14\u201319) IL-5 3 (2\u20133) 4 (4\u20134) 5 (4\u201316) 6 (4 the low quantity of bacterial RNA recovered restricted the number of genes we could study. analysis showed five out of the six genes studied were expressed at a higher level compared with pneumococci exposed to mock-infected epithelium. expression of neuraminidase B (nanB), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase (nox) and competence-stimulating peptide (comX) genes a table shows the exact genes that are up-regulated and down-regulated in the transcriptome of S. pneumoniae. we confirmed this interaction using antigen colocalization and confocal imaging. this showed that RSV G protein directly binds to the surface of the pneumococcus. peptides covered 43% of a 79.7-kD protein that showed a greater than 99% match probability to the S. pneumoniae PBP1A protein. the protein sequencing was performed as described in Methods in the online supplement. incubation of pneumococci with RSV or purified RSV G protein did not affect bacterial viability. however, pneumococci exposed to RSV G protein showed significant differences in the transcriptome compared with pneumococci exposed to BSA. expression of 157 genes were altered of which 99 were up-regulated and 58 were down-regulated in response to RSV G protein treatment. all mice receiving the same dose of pneumococci alone survived the 7-day challenge without any signs of disease. a previous study showed that mice receiving sequential infection by RSV then pneumococci had significantly greater inflammation and high levels of accumulated neutrophils compared with control mice and mice inoculated with each pathogen separately (10). this eliminated the possibility of a toxic effect from the RSV preparation. 105 cfu S. pneumoniae D39 previously exposed to either BSA (Control Pneumococci) or RSV (RSV+Pneumococci) for 2 hours. nd = no significant difference (P > 0.05); n = 3. thelial cell ciliary dysfunction caused by RSV is additive rather than synergistic with the response to pneumococcus alone. this suggests that coinfection of respiratory epithelium by RSV and the pneumococcus may lead to a further increase in inflammatory cells and increased lung cellular inflammation. a second form of RSV G protein is secreted from infected cells. the protein directly binds pneumococcal PBP1a and binding RSV G protein led to significant changes to the pneumococcal transcriptome (in the absence of infected cells) the gene for pneumolysin (ply) was also up-regulated following exposure to RSV G protein. lung pathology was absent in all groups except the mice exposed to pneumococci. only one mouse (from a group of five) had extensive immune cell recruitment. this indicates an immune mediated process in the development of mortality."}
