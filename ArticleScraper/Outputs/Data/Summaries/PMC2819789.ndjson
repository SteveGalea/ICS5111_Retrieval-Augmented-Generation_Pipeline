{"summary": "the basic reproduction number, R0, of an infectious disease is the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population [1]. Statistical estimation of R0 has been performed for various infectious diseases [2,3], aiming towards understanding the dynamics of transmission and evolution, and designing effective public health intervention strategies. j(t) is written as: j ( t ) = 0 A ( ) j ( t ) d. when j(t) follows an exponential growth path, it is easy to extract the integral of A() from equation (1). j(t) = kexp(rt)exp(\u2013r). 0 is achieved by measuring the exponential growth rate r from the incidence data. it is achieved by assuming that g() is known (or separately estimated from empirical observation such as contact tracing data) the above mentioned framework has not been given a likelihood-based method for estimating R0 (i.e., a likelihood function used for fitting a statistical model to data, and providing estimates for R0) the estimate is very sensitive to dispersal (or underlying epidemiological assumptions) of the progression of a disease [7]. assuming that the generation time, i.e., the time from infection of a primary case to infection of a secondary case generated by the primary case is known. the conventional estimation technique has required two statistical steps, namely, first estimate r and then convert r to R0. this simplifies (1) to the so-called Euler-Lotka equation. we can write g() as: g ( ) = A ( ) 0 A ( s ) d s = A ( ) R 0. (4) Replacing A() in the right-hand side of (3) by that of (4), an estimator of R0 is obtained. the actual reproduction number, Ra, has been proposed for HIV/AIDS. the concept of Ra is much simpler than R0 in that it is defined as a product of the mean duration of infectiousness and the ratio of incidence to prevalence. the prevalence p(t) at calendar time t is written as: p ( t ) = 0 ( ) j ( t ) d (6) where () is the survivorship of infectiousness, or probability of being infectious, at infection-age (9) Ra coincides with R0 as long as () is constant. in many instances, contact frequency and infectiousness vary as a function of infection-age. the variation is particularly the case for HIV infection. g() is the density function of the generation time, with a mean of 3.79 years. for d2 years shortly after infection, the frequency g1 is very high. g2 is persistently low, followed by a time period with high infectiousness g3 for d3 years until death or no secondary transmission due to AIDS. g(), in the renewal equation with the Kermack and McKendrick type assumption, is written as the normalized density of secondary transmissions. the estimator of corrected Ra in (11) is identical to that of R0. the ratio of prevalence to mean generation time p(t)/D in the denominator of the right-hand side of (10) has been replaced by 'the total number of effective contacts that have equal potential to generate secondary cases' the peak incidence was observed in 1982 for western Germany and 1983 for France and the UK. in the following, the time period from 1976 up to one year prior to the peak incidence is taken as the early growth phase. the yearly number of new HIV infections (i.e., incidence) and new AIDS cases from 1976\u20132000. the probability of estimating R0 with (15) is proposed as follows. the right-hand side of equation (16) is interpreted as follows. the probability of estimating R0 with (15) is proposed as follows. a single primary case in year t is given by 1/R0. the likelihood function for estimating R0 is: L ( R 0 ) = t = 1 T ( j t s = 0 g s j t s) j t s = 0 g s j t s. the transmission rate depends primarily on the frequency of contact and infectiousness at infection-age. the actual reproduction number Ra is written as: R a = j ( t ) p ( t ) D = 0 ( ) j ( t ) d (6) where () is the survivorship of infectiousness, or probability of being infectious, at infection-age. g1, g2 and g3 have been estimated at 1.30, 0.05 and 0.36 per year. for d2 years shortly after infection, the frequency g1 is very high. for d2 years shortly after infection, the frequency g1 is very high. for d2 years shortly after infection, g2 is very high. d1, d2 and d3 are assumed to be 0.24, 8.38 and 0.75 years. g1, g2 and g3 are estimated at 1.30, 0.05 and 0.36 per year. the equation (8) is rewritten as: R a ( t ) = j ( t ) 1 D 0 ( t ) j ( t ) d. in the right-hand side of (11) by that of (12), the estimator of corrected Ra is identical to that of R0. the ratio of prevalence to mean generation time p(t)/D in the denominator of the right-hand side of (10) has been replaced by \"the total number of effective contacts that have equal potential to generate secondary cases\" a total of 23,243, 13,126 and 11,491 cases were diagnosed in these countries from 1976\u20132000. yearly number of new HIV infections (i.e., incidence) and new AIDS cases from 1976\u20132000. AIDS cases are the observed data, while HIV incidence is estimated by means of a back-calculation method used by Artzrouni [23]. gs = G(s + 1) \u2013 G(s) is the cumulative distribution function of the generation time of length s. probability of estimating R0 with (15) is proposed as follows. j t s = 0 g s j t s (17) where T is the most recent time point of observation within an early (linear) epidemic growth stage. the maximum likelihood estimate of R0 is obtained by minimizing the negative logarithm of (17) and the 95% CI are derived from the profile likelihood. the 95% CI based on the proposed method appeared to be wider than those based on exponential growth assumption. since HIV is mainly transmitted via sexual contact, the above mentioned estimate may vary with the mixing pattern and contact frequency. the simple likelihood function employing a binomial distribution was also proposed. equation (15) permits calculation of the expected value of R0 without likelihood. the corrected Ra does not require prevalence data. the next-generation matrix would give more detailed insights into the epidemic dynamics, including the most important target host for intervention [36]. understanding the implications of sexual partnerships and their variations as a function of calendar time and infection-age is also of utmost importance."}
