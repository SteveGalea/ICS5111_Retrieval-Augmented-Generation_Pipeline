{"summary": "ebolaviruses are hemorrhagic fever viruses that constitute a genus within the Filoviridae family. the 2013-2014 outbreak was caused by EBOV-Makona, a member of this lethal EBOV species (1). at the time of the outbreak, several anti-EBOV therapeutics and vaccines were in development. alanine scanning study defined residues required for binding of each MAb to EBOV-Mayinga GP. we provide the first three-dimensional (3D) images of GP from EBOV-Makona, unliganded, as well as in individual complexes with MAbs c13C6, c2G4 and c4G7. c2G4 and c4G7 block entry of VLPs bearing EBOV GP. entry-reporter EBOV VP40-driven VLPs bearing GPs from the Mayinga and Makona isolates were prepared as described previously (11) in brief, 293T/17 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding EBOV GP, VP40, lam-VP40, and mCherry-VP40. ctron microscopy (cryo-EM) grids were incubated on ice with or without antibodies for 30 to 60 min. the mixture was then pipetted onto plasma-cleaned 200-mesh carbon grids. excess buffer was blotted from the grids at room temperature and 95% humidity. for the unbound GP data set, we verified that the spikes chosen represent the global population by picking spikes from the entire surface of each VLP. this increased the number of picked subvolumes by nearly 10-fold, yet resulted in a structure extremely similar to the map shown in Fig. 1. structure of EBOV-Mayinga GP bound to ZMapp antibodies shown unbound (A) or bound to ZMapp antibodies c13C6 (B), c4G7 (C), or c2G4 (D). X-ray coordinates are colored with the GP1 region in green, GP2 in blue, and residues important for binding to NPC1 in orange. VLP surface areas were measured in six tomographic slices. the number of GP spikes within each surface area was counted. the center-to-center distance was measured between each visible trimer. the cells were pretreated with 20 M nocodazole (ACROS organics), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; mock-treated samples), or Opti-MEM1 (Gibco/Life Technologies, for MAb-treated samples) after 18 to 24 h, the cells were pretreated with 20 M nocodazole (ACROS organics), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; mock-treated samples) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a rabbit anti-GP1 (a gift from Paul Bates) diluted 1:1,000 in 5% milk-PBS. rabbit anti-GP1 F88 peptide (18) diluted 1:500 in 5% milk-PBS. rabbit anti-GP1 F88 peptide (18) diluted 1:500 in 5% milk-PBS. membranes were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. anti-human horseradish peroxidase (HRP) IgG (Thermo Scientific; 1:10,000 in PBS) was added for 1 h at room temperature. soluble NPC1 C-loop was modeled after the construct described in references (19, 20) indicated VLPs were bound overnight to a high-bind ELISA plate. the plate was then washed and blocked (5% milk-PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. after further washing, 0.2 g/ml soluble NPC1 C-loop was added. a gift from Xiaowei Zhuang, Harvard University, was propagated in high-glucose modified Eagle medium supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. cDNAs bearing GPs from the Mayinga and Makona isolates of EBOV were prepared as described previously (11) the c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7 MAbs (intact IgGs) were titered for entry competency on BSC-1 cells. purified Ebola VLPs were incubated on ice with or without antibodies for about 30 to 60 min at an approximate ratio of 2 g of antibody to 1 g of VLP. between 11 and 26 tilt series were collected for each sample. glycoprotein spikes (1,000 to 2,500 spikes per complex) were picked automatically for subvolume averaging. tomograms were binned by 8 in this study. EBOV-Makona + c13c6 13 1,591 75 EBOV-Makona + c2G4 26 2,470 1,998 EBOV-Makona + c4G7 14 1,674 135 a For each data set, the numbers of tomograms, subvolumes picked, and subvolumes contributing to the structure presented are shown. the same X-ray coordinate position was used in each GP map for consistency. the density and spacing of GP on the surface of EBOV-Makona VLPs were determined using tomographic reconstructions where clearly visible top views of trimeric GP molecules were visible. 40,000 BSC-1 cells were seeded per well of a 24-well plate containing glass coverslips coated with 20 g/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) after 18 to 24 h, the cells were pretreated with 20 M nocodazole (ACROS organics), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; mock-treated samples), or Opti-MEM1. the 19-kDa GP was generated as described previously (12) in brief, VLPs bearing EBOV-Makona or EBOV-Mayinga GP were treated with 0.25 mg/ml thermolysin (VitaCyte) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cleavage reaction was quenched by the addition of 500 M phosphoramidon (Sigma-Aldrich) VLPs (0.5 g/well) were bound to a high-bind enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate overnight at 4\u00b0C. the ELISA plate was then washed and blocked (3% bovine serum albumin [BSA]-PBS) after another wash, 50 g/ml c2G4, c4G7, or c13C6 (PBS for control) were added. hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was then produced by transfecting suspension 293F cells with this pDisplay vector. after 72 h, the protein was purified in batch using Ni-Sepharose high-performance affinity media (GE Healthcare) essentially as described previously (19). IgG, c2G4 IgG, and c4G7 IgG have been deposited in the EMDataBank under accession numbers EMD-8225, EMD-8226, EMD-8227, and EMD-8228. a previous single-particle EM study located the binding sites of Fabs from the three MAbs in the ZMapp cocktail on the soluble ectodomain of GP from the Mayinga isolate of EBOV akona GP embedded in a membrane at high density on filamentous EBOV VP40-driven VLPs. we first sought to determine whether c13C6, c2G4 and c4G7 bind to EBOV-Makona GP on the surface of VLPs in the same locations and orientations. using cryo-EM tomography, we were able to visualize the Makona GP protein in a native-like state, bound to the density of GP spikes on the surface of EBOV-Makona VLPs was 0.4 GP spikes per 100 nm2 0.1 GP per 100 nm2. the density of GP spikes on the surface of EBOV-Makona VLPs was 0.4 GP spikes per 100 nm2 0.1 GP per 100 nm2 (SD) structure has dimensions of 10 nm at the widest portion of the head domain. edge-to-edge distance between GP spikes at the c4G7 binding epitope is approximately 11.5 nm. tomographic slices of EBOV-Makona VLPs incubated with c4G7 IgG molecules show evidence of GP bridging. a model of GP spikes on the surface of EBOV-Makona VLPs is shown using a top view of the cryo-EM structure of unbound GP. a model IgG molecule (PDB accession number 1IGT) is shown in green. c2G4 and c4G7 blocked entry of VLPs bearing GP from EBOV isolate. c2G4 was more potent than c4G7. c13C6 did not have a significant impact on virus entry. the percent entry values in mock-treated samples were 46, 41, and 36%. c2G4 and c4G7 blocked VLP entry mediated by EBOV-Mayinga GP. previous biochemical studies showed that c2G4 and c4G7 compete for binding to EBOV-Mayinga GP. MAbs c2G4 and c4G7 do not inhibit trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes. control cells had been preincubated with 20 M nocodazole (Noc) for 1 h prior. data are the average Manders coefficients for colocalization of mCherry-VLPs (red) with NPC1. c2G4 and c4G7 bind to 19-kDa GP on VLPs and block entry mediated by 19-kDa GP. c2G4 and c4G7 were able to block entry mediated by 19-kDa GP. c2G4 and c4G7 were able to block entry mediated by 19-kDa GP. VLPs bearing VSV-G were used as a control. 50 g/ml MAb c2G4, c4G7, or c13C6 were added. cleavage of full-length GP to 19 kDa confirmed by Western blotting. avage of full-length GP (130 kDa) to 19 kDa was confirmed by Western blotting. another key event in EBOV entry is binding of the proteolytically primed form of GP to NPC1 (20) in endolysosomes. c2G4 and c4G7 do not block binding of the NPC1 C-loop to 19-kDa GP. 0.2 g/ml soluble NPC1 C-loop (PBS for no NPC1 C-loop samples) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Cleavage of full-length GP to 19 kDa was confirmed by Western blotting. c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7 (intact IgGs) on EBOV-Makona GP embedded in a membrane at high density on filamentous EBOV-Makona GP. we first sought to determine whether c13C6, c2G4 and c4G7 bind to EBOV-Makona GP on the surface of VLPs. c13C6 IgG bound to the glycan cap region, perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. the dense array of c13C6 projecting perpendicularly from the VLP may therefore contribute to the Fc effector function (23) c4G7 and c2G4 bind to overlapping epitopes within the base region of EBOV-Makona GP. unbound GP on the Makona EBOV VLP surface has dimensions of 10 nm at the widest portion of the head domain and 3.5 nm at the base where c2G4 and c4G7 bind. the edge-to-edge distance between GP spikes at the c4G7 binding epitope is approximately 11.5 nm (Fig. 2A) a tomographic slice of an unbound EBOV-Makona VLP surface shows top views of trimeric GP proteins. center-to-center distance between spikes is shown in the upper right corner inset. GP spikes are spaced 15 nm apart, the measured distance between the base portion of the maps is 11.5 nm. c2G4 and c4G7 neutralize infections by EBOV and recombinant VSV expressing the GP from Mayinga EBOV (4, 6\u20138). c2G4 and c4G7 blocked entry of VLPs bearing GP from the mayinga isolate of EBOV. c13C6 did not have a significant impact on virus entry. c2G4 and c4G7 blocked VLP entry mediated by EBOV-Mayinga GP. c2G4 and c4G7 compete for binding to EBOV-Makona GP. c2G7 inhibited the ability of c2G4 to block entry. c2G4 and c4G7 do not inhibit trafficking of EBOV GP VLPs to NPC1+ endolysosomes. c2G4 and c4G7 stay bound to GP all throughout VLP trafficking to, and proteolytic processing in, highly acidic endolysosomes. white arrows indicate areas of VLP-NPC1 colocalization. red arrows indicate areas of VLP-NPC1 colocalization. c2G4 and c4G7 bound to 19-kDa GP. c2G4 and c4G7 bind to 19-kDa EBOV GP on VLPs and block entry mediated by 19-kDa GP. VLPs bearing EBOV-Makona GP were untreated, mock treated, or (thermolysin) treated and then bound (triplicate samples) to high-bind ELISA plates. entry level of untreated VLPs with full-length GP was 60%, and that of VLPs with (thermolysin)-treated (19 kDa) GP was 35%. c2G4 and c4G7, which bind strongly to 19-kDa GP, did not block binding of a soluble NPC1 C-loop construct to 19-kDa GP. VLPs bearing EBOV-Mayinga GP were mock treated or (thermolysin) treated (to 19 kDa) and then bound (triplicate samples) to a high-bind ELISA plate. after washing, 0.2 g/ml soluble NPC1 C-loop (PBS for no NPC1 C-loop samples) was added. c2G4 and c4G7 display overlapping binding sites to the base region of the EBOV-Mayinga GP ectodomain (9, 10). c2G4 and c4G7 bind as intact IgGs to GP from EBOV-Makona. c4G7 diminishes the ability of c2G4 to block entry of EBOV particles into the cell cytoplasm. c2G4 and c4G7 bind to, and inhibit cytoplasmic entry of, VLPs bearing 19-kDa GP. c2G4 and c4G7, as well as KZ52, another neutralizing MAb (21), require C511 and C556 in the EBOV GP fusion subunit (GP2) for binding (10). these cysteine residues form the disulfide bond that clasps the ends of the fusion loop"}
