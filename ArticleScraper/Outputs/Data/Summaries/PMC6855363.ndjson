{"summary": "a large number of virus genomes have been engineered to carry additional sequences for a variety of purposes. baculovirus expression system is widely used for expression work. lentiviruses show great promise for gene therapy. phage display allows for selection of desired epitopes. we present some conceptual considerations pertaining to sequence stability. we identify theory and experiments that point toward viable strategies for mitigating rapid loss of inserted genes. we argue that virus genome organization has a large impact on the stability of inserted sequences. insertions are more stable than for ssRNA(+) viruses VI: ssRNA-RT Lentivirus, Gammaretrovirus Engineered viruses have plastic genomes. insertions are more stable than for ssRNA(+) viruses VI: ssRNA-RT Lentivirus, Gammaretrovirus Engineered viruses have plastic genomes. dsDNA viruses have a wide range of genome sizes, from the small polyomaviridae and papillomaviridae to the relatively recent discovered giant viruses. dsDNA viruses have a wide range of genome sizes, from 4.5 to 8.4 kbp to 1,200 to 2,300 kbp. the phylogenomic reconstructions performed by Koonin and Yutin (2018) suggest that giant viruses have evolved from simpler viruses (infecting animals) on many independent occasions. this again suggests that the host plays an important role in genome stability where in animals the pressure for smaller virus genomes is stronger than in protists. replication-competent human adenovirus expressing the rabies glycoprotein was similar to that of the wild-type virus. non-human adenoviruses can be used as alternative vaccine vectors, providing several advantages such as a limited host range and restricted replication in non-host species. rapid generation of DIs involves several recombination steps. loss of sequences inserted into baculovirus genomes is not only due to formation of DIs. inserted foreign sequences were still rapidly lost. lambdaviruses of E.coli were widely used as cloning vectors. methods were developed to increase the stability and maximum size of inserts. phage T7 engineered with biofilm-degrading enzyme was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short-term biofilms. ssDNA viruses have much smaller genome sizes as compared to the dsDNA viruses (group I), ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 kbp genomes of the Circoviridae to the 24.9 kbp genome of the Spiraviridae. one would expect that ssDNA viruses are less plastic compared their dsDNA counterparts. ssDNA viruses present unique challenges when thinking about stability of inserted sequences. a lower frequency would also entail a lower mutational supply, limiting evolvability, the capacity of the virus to generate beneficial variation and subsequently adapt. dsRNA viruses have a range of genome sizes (3.7\u201330.5 kb) that is similar to the ssDNA viruses. dsRNA viruses have a range of genome sizes (3.7\u201330.5 kb) that is similar to the ssDNA viruses. dsRNA virus genomes are highly streamlined, since most gene insertions will disturb the recognition and packaging process of the ssRNAs. we hypothesize that few if any gene insertions will lead to viable genomes due to the perturbation of segmented genome assembly into viruses. stoichiometric packaging of segmented genomes may form an impediment to engineering and insert stability. dsRNA viruses range in genome size from 2.3 to 31 kbp. ssRNA(+) viruses can express inserted foreign genes. insertions of up to 534 bp of the rotavirus VP7 gene into Sabin 3 poliovirus gave rise to infectious viruses that expressed portions of the VP7 outer capsid protein. the size of the insert in this construction is limited as only inserts of 300 bp or smaller were stable upon serial passages in tissue culture. recombinant Flaviviridae viruses carrying the split-luciferase gene were generated. in vitro, these recombinant viruses appear evolutionary stable and propagation was comparable to the wild-type virus, most probably due to the small 11 amino acid insert size. inserted gene was stably expressed upon serial passaging in vitro. presence of GM-CSF led to increased surface expression of MHCI+, MHCII+, and CD80/86+. recombinant strain is expected to elicit stronger immune responses. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT) genes were successfully expressed in plants by using tobacco mosaic virus as a vector. bacterial GUS gene has shown to successfully express when inserted into the viral genome of potato virus X (PVX) DHFR gene (238 bp) inserted in a TMV background appears to be maintained stably through several passages, while the 3.5 larger NPT gene (832 bp) in the same experimental setup was unstable during systemic movement of the virus. sequences with a codon usage similar to that of the viral vector may be retained longer than those that have an opposite codon usage. the TEV-eGFP genomes that lost the insert had a within-host competitive fitness advantage. the smaller the genome the higher the within-host competitive fitness. this result suggests that a demographic \u2018sweet spot\u2019 exists. in several studies passage duration has an effect on insert stability. the frequency of the deletion variant is f D = D / I and vice versa I = 1 / D. to illustrate the effects of bottlenecks we chose the parameters in Table 2, set the initial fD to zero. the difference in fitness between the virus with insertion and without is large. the stability of an insert could change when considering insertions that might be beneficial for the virus. insertion was rapidly purged from the viral genome, restoring fitness to wild-type fitness levels. a duplicated copy could act as a stepping stone to the evolution of new biological functions. deletion dynamics of duplicated genes were associated with the passage duration and the size of the duplicated copy. the fitness effects alone are not enough to predict genomic stability. ssRNA() viruses are composed of genomes that range from 10 to 25.2 kbp in size. homologous recombination in ssRNA() viruses can be another explanation for higher genomic stability. low homologous recombination rates could be a limiting factor on sequence evolution. recombinant measles virus expressing spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV is genetic. VSV is a commonly used vaccine vector that has been engineered to express surface proteins from diverse viruses. it replicates most efficiently in cells with diminished innate immunity. promoter proximal genes are more efficiently expressed than promoter distal ones. ssRNA() viruses accept relatively large inserts without drastically affecting virus replication. inserts up to 3.9 kbp in the 15.4 kbp genome of the human parainfluenza virus 3 were viable. retroviruses often undergo genomic rearrangements, including gene insertions and deletions (indels) recombination can be common due to the combination of 'diploid' virus particles and high intrinsic recombination rates. insertions showed lower levels of expression (Nakane, Iwamoto, and Matsuda 2015), which is consistent with V3 having the lowest indel rate. this is consistent with V3 having the lowest indel rate (Palmer and Poon 2018), thus having a lower stability after gene insertions. eGFP sequence was inserted into MLV under different configurations. reporter gene was deleted upon extended cell culture. stability improved by decreasing length of sequence repeats flanking the inserted sequence. genome replication of the Caulimoviridae is entirely episomal. fragmented and rearranged endogenous caulimovirus sequences have been found in a wide variety of plant species. integration into human genome can cause genetic damage and chromosomal instability leading to HBV-induced liver cancer. the differences in stability of inserts in the CaMV genome depend on at least two factors. the site of the insert seems to be important as many inserts are lethal for the virus. the size of the insert is important, as the size of the insert is important. dsDNA viruses have a wide range of genome sizes, from the small polyomaviridae and papillomaviridae to the relatively recent discovered giant viruses. genome expansions and reductions are common among dsDNA viruses, indicating that their genomes are flexible and that gene insertions do not necessarily reduce viral fitness. wild viruses Even when viruses have large DNA genomes, they are not very stable per se. the phylogenomic reconstructions performed by Koonin and Yutin (2018) suggest that giant viruses have evolved from simpler viruses (infecting animals) on many independent occasions. this again suggests that the host plays an important role in genome stability where in animals the pressure for smaller virus genomes is stronger than in protists. replication-competent human adenovirus expressing the rabies glycoprotein was similar to that of the wild-type virus. rabies virus gene was stable during both in vivo and in vitro passaging. non-human adenoviruses can be used as alternative vaccine vectors. rapid generation of DIs involves several recombination steps. loss of sequences inserted into baculovirus genomes is not only due to formation of DIs. inserted foreign sequences were still rapidly lost. lambdaviruses of E.coli were widely used as cloning vectors. methods were developed to increase the stability and maximum size of inserts. phage T7 engineered with biofilm-degrading enzyme was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short-term biofilms. vaccinia virus undergoes rapid changes in size due to unequal crossover events leading to stable and unstable forms. the diversity in this region is needed for immune evasion and for colonization of novel hosts. vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is used as a viral vector for the development of vaccines against infectious diseases such as malaria, influenza, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, and Ebola. as an alternative, recombinant human adenovirus vaccine vectors expressing the rabies glycoprotein have been developed. a variety of antigens and cytokines were successfully expressed in vivo. stability of bovine adenovirus type 1 was tested by inserting the EYFP marker and subsequently passingaging the recombinant virus in cell culture. sequences inserted in infectious clones were genetically stable in Escherichia coli. insertion at the gG locus was highly unstable, whereas the same insert was stable when inserted between the us9 and us2 genes. dsDNA phages were widely used as cloning vectors. dsDNA viruses containing foreign gene insertions are relatively unstable. host-switches may play important roles in increased plasticity and stability of dsDNA viral genomes. ssDNA viruses have much smaller genome sizes as compared to the dsDNA viruses (group I) wild viruses of frequent sequence insertions, duplications, and deletions are the Geminiviridae, with genomes of 2.5\u20133 kbp (monopartite) or 4.8\u20135.6 kbp (bipartite) during the course of geminivirus infection in plants, shorter subgenomic DNAs often arise. these subgenomic DNAs can range in size and some result in defective DNAs. the size of encapsidated DNA determines the multiplicity of geminivirus particles. the nanoviridae family includes ssDNA viruses with a multipartite genome. these viruses present unique challenges when thinking about the stability of inserted sequences. the nature of the insert appears to be more important than the size of the insert, indicating that the genomic context also plays an important role in the stability of ssDNA viruses. wild viruses of frequent sequence insertions, duplications, and deletions. deletion mutants of the africa cassava mosaic virus have also shown to revert back to the original wild-type genome length through recombination between the two components of the bipartite genome. the selection pressure on the reversion to wild-type genome length is probably a strong size constraint on encapsidation. dsRNA viruses have a range of genome sizes (3.7\u201330.5 kb) that is similar to the ssDNA viruses. many dsRNA viruses contain segmented genomes, where positive-sense ssRNAs are packaged into procapsids and serve as templates for dsRNA synthesis. genome segments containing sequence duplications are preferentially packaged into progeny viruses relative to wild-type segments. if a gene insertion happens to be viable, it will probably be rapidly purged from the viral genome. some studies that test the stability of inserts in dsRNA viruses are available. stoichiometric packaging of segmented genomes may form an impediment to engineering and insert stability. however, recent work also suggests careful engineering of dsRNA viruses may lead to stable sequence insertions. ssRNA(+) viruses range in genome size from 2.3 to 31 kbp. the nature of the ssRNA(+) genomes poses several limitations to efficient expression and maintenance of the insert. most ssRNA(+) genomes used for expression of foreign genes code for a polyprotein. the size of the insert is limited as only inserts of 300 bp or smaller were stable upon serial passages in tissue culture. the recombinant viruses expressing the inserted gene were found to be slower in the assembly of infectious virus particles. recombinant virus expressing porcine interleukin-4 was tested in chimeric mice. recombinant virus remained stable upon serial passaging in vitro. GM-CSF was inserted in a PRRSV vaccine strain. viral genes were replaced with the gene of interest (gene replacement instead of gene insertion) this strategy appeared to be (partially) successful in plant ssDNA viruses. replacement strategy was mostly unsuccessful in plant ssRNA viruses. in all these cases the presence of a foreign gene leads to genomic instability. this may result from the presence of the insert leading to lower accumulation levels of the genomic RNA, as well as leading to mRNA instability and/or interfering with synthesis of the viral proteins. this may also lead to the subsequent deletion of the inserted sequence. eGFP can be considered a non-functional sequence, as it does not add any function to the viral genome. the loss of eGFP depended on the passage length, where longer passages led to a faster and assured loss. the smaller the genome the higher the within-host competitive fitness. a simulation model of the effects of genetic drift on insertion stability uses a simulation model. this model incorporates logistic virus growth, deterministic recombination with a fixed rate, and population bottlenecks after a given number of generations. dD dt = D D 1 - D + I + I. the simulation data illustrate how narrow bottlenecks can lead to stable inserted sequence. only when the bottleneck is wider is the probability of sampling the virus variant with a deletion large enough for this to occur regularly. the insertion was rapidly purged from the viral genome, restoring fitness to wild-type fitness levels. this insertion duplicated the function of RNA silencing suppression function of another gene in the genome. if a duplicated sequence is stable it may act as a stepping stone to evolution of new biological functions. recombinant viruses expressing VP7 gene were found to be slower in assembly of infectious virus particles. recombinant Sindbis viruses appeared unstable and especially inserts at the 3\u2032 end were rapidly lost during serial passages, suggesting a positional effect. recombinant Flaviviridae viruses carrying the split-luciferase gene were generated (Tamura et al. 2018), including dengue virus, japanese encephalitis virus, HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus. in vitro, these recombinant viruses appear evolutionary stable and propagation was comparable to the wild-type virus, most probably due to the small 11 amino acid insert size. the recombinant strain is expected to elicit stronger immune responses. it has been shown that many different plant viruses can express foreign genes. it has the advantage being able to express these directly in vivo. the bacterial GUS gene has been shown to express when inserted into the viral genome of potato virus X (PVX) in all these cases the presence of a foreign gene leads to genomic instability. this instability may result from the presence of the insert leading to lower accumulation levels of the genomic RNA, as well as leading to mRNA instability. eGFP can be considered a non-functional sequence, as it does not add any function to the viral genome. the loss of eGFP depended on the passage length, where longer passages led to a faster and assured loss. the 3.5 larger NPT gene (832 bp) was unstable during systemic movement of the virus. the smaller the genome the higher the within-host competitive fitness. convergent evolution did occur in terms of fixed point mutations. this result suggests that a demographic \u2018sweet spot\u2019 exists. the frequency of the deletion variant is f D = D / D + I. at the start of each passage we draw the number I from a Binomial distribution with a size and success probability f D from the previous time point, and then D = - I. the stability of an insert could change when considering insertions that might be beneficial for the virus. we simulated two HGT events by separately introducing functional exogenous sequences that are potentially beneficial for the virus. the insertion was rapidly purged from the viral genome. deletion dynamics of duplicated genes were associated with the passage duration and the size of the duplicated copy. the fitness effects alone are not enough to predict genomic stability. ssRNA() viruses are composed of genomes that range from 10 to 25.2 kbp in size. non-homologous recombination will likely rarely lead to variants with the insert deleted and other regions undisturbed. genetic deletions that disrupt the inserted sequence will be subject to less constraints, as for example they can disrupt the reading frame of the insert. VSV is a commonly used vaccine vector that has been engineered to express surface proteins from diverse viruses. it replicates most efficiently in cells with diminished innate immunity. ssRNA() viruses accept relatively large inserts. sendai virus, with a genome size of about 15.3 kbp, can carry and efficiently express gene insertions up to 3.2 kbp. insert size is limited, where final virus titers in vitro are proportionally reduced as the insert size increases. a recombinant measles virus expressing the spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV is genetically stable in vitro and induces strong humoral and cellular immunity in vivo. a recombinant measles virus expressing the spike glycoprotein of MERS-CoV is genetically stable in vitro. ssRNA() viruses accept relatively large insert without drastically affecting virus replication. insertions up to 3.9 kbp in the 15.4 kbp genome of human parainfluenza virus 3 were viable and replicated efficiently in vitro. retroviruses are small viruses varying in genome size from 7 to 11 kbp. retroviruses often undergo genomic rearrangements, including gene insertions and deletions (indels) the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein contains five variable regions (V1\u2013V5) that can tolerate a higher rate of indels than the rest of the genome. certain regions (V4 and V5) were more tolerant to foreign gene insertions than the other variable regions (V1, V2, and V3). this is consistent with V3 having the lowest indel rate (Palmer and Poon 2018) replication-competent retrovirus vectors are promising vectors for cancer gene therapy. the suitability of murine leukemia virus-based vectors has been analyzed in vitro and in vivo by Paar et al. (2007). indels appear to have an impact on virus transmission and adaptation. indels in the gag and vif genes are associated with drug resistance. the viral surface envelope glycoprotein contains five variable regions (V1\u2013V5) that can tolerate a higher rate of indels than the rest of the genome. the random integration of retroviruses in the host genome poses a risk. the integration near the LMO2 proto-oncogene promoter can trigger leukemia. the limited efficiency of in vivo gene transfer poses another obstacle. retro-transcribing dsDNA viruses have small genome sizes varying from 3 to 8.3 kb. the virus replicate through an RNA intermediate, and in some cases the pre-genomic RNA is alternatively spliced. insertions can disturb a viral regulatory sequence or lead to incorrect processing of alternative spliced products. several studies in the 1980s already reported the possibility of inserting foreign DNA into specific sites of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) genome without greatly affecting viral infectivity or function. in two of these studies, functional bacterial genes were introduced into the CaMV genome, where a fragment of the lac operator was lost after five successive transfers. a split GFP system has been engineered (Cabantous, Terwilliger, and Waldo 2005), where only a small part of GFP is introduced in the viral vector and the other part is expressed using a transgenic host. the partial GFP insertion was stable for ten or four serial passages. studies in the 1980s already reported the possibility of inserting foreign DNA into specific sites of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) genome without greatly affecting viral infectivity or function. in two of these studies, functional bacterial genes were introduced into the CaMV genome. size of GFP is relatively large (around 700 nt) and often leads to instability of vectors. a split GFP system has been engineered (Cabantous, Terwilliger, and Waldo 2005), where only a small part of GFP is introduced in the viral vector and the other part is expressed using a transgenic host. a high-cost inserted sequence might therefore limit viral evolvability. a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when short-duration passages are used. a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when short-duration passages are used, but not in long-duration passages. if deletion mutants fail to reach a frequency /, where is the bottleneck size, they are unlikely to pass through the bottleneck. this leads to a \u2018resetting\u2019 of the virus population by each bottleneck event, effectively resulting in high stability of the inserted sequences. the frequency of a deletion variant (fD) changes over time when the size of the population bottleneck is changed. for all three panels, viral generations are on the x-axis, the log frequency of the deletion variant which has lost the insert is on the y-axis and replicate populations are plotted in different randomly chosen shades of blue along the z-axis. the ubiquitousness of the toxin will limit selection against the virus variant with the deletion. when MOI is low, due to genetic drift at the cellular not all cells will contain both variants. when MOI is low, due to genetic drift at the cellular not all cells will contain both variants. the virus variant with the deletion is selected because those cells infected only with this variant have higher replication. this tragedy of the commons is a reversal of the situation sketched above for high MOIs. one proposed strategy to increase stability would be setting up culture conditions such that phages are growing in isolation or spatially structured environments. some experimental protocols already exploit some of these principles, in particular strict adherence to low MOI. mutations are 1, regulatory mutations (i.e. promoter mutations) that downregulate gene expression (van Opijnen, Boerlijst, and Berkhout 2006), 2, removal of immunogenic sequence motifs (Fros et al. 2017), 3, alteration of unfavorable secondary RNA structures (McFadden et al. 2013), and 4, adopting a more favorable codon usage. recombination rates are high for many viruses the stability of genomic insertions in viral genomes depends on two key factors: the supply of mutations that remove the insertion and the larger the selection coefficients of variants with the insert removed, the less stable the insertion will be. the interplay between mutation and selection will govern the stability of genomic inserts, and in many cases demography has an important role in shaping this interplay. a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when short-duration passages are used, but not in long-duration passages. if deletion mutants fail to reach a frequency, they are unlikely to pass through the bottleneck. this leads to a'resetting' of the virus population by each bottleneck event. the population bottleneck is narrow (panel A), the frequency of deletion variants is \u2018reset\u2019 during passaging as they are too scarce to be sampled. if an inserted sequence affects viral fitness in trans at the within cell level, the MOI will determine whether there can be selection. in panel A, we illustrate how the cellular MOI can have a direct effect on selection strength. consider a virus that expresses a product that is toxic and acts in trans within cells to lower replication levels. deletions can remove the gene coding this gene. at high MOI all cells will be infected with both variants and the toxin will lower replication. the ubiquitousness of the toxin will limit selection against the virus variant with the deletion. heterologous expression of endosialidase leads to increased amplification of phage T7 in capsulated E.coli. but a phage that did not express dispersin outcompeted the engineered virus. this tragedy of the commons is a reversal of the situation sketched above for high MOIs. mutations, deletion of the inserted sequence are the most likely trajectory. recombination rates are high for many viruses and there are many possible recombination events that partially remove an insertion. mutation bias might therefore drive the evolutionary route that followed. beneficial point mutations typically occur long after gene amplification by copy number variation. deletions that remove an insertion to be fixed before point mutations that also lessen its impact occur. alternative evolutionary trajectories could contribute to making stability of genomic inserts less repeatable and predictable in some cases. the varying frequency of genomic segments might lead to rapid adaptive responses to inserted sequences. in the case of segmented dsRNA (group III) viruses, sequence insertions probably perturb segmented genome assembly. multipartite viruses present unique challenges when thinking about the stability of inserted sequences. a surprisingly large number of studies draw conclusions on the stability of inserted sequences in viral genomes based on experiments with either no or low replication. we cannot stress enough the importance of replication in studying genomic stability, in first place because mutation is a stochastic process."}
