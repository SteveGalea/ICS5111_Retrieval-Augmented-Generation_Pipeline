{"summary": "retrotransposons are subdivided into four subclasses: LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which are closely related to retroviruses. nonLTR retrotransposons, also called LINEs, DIRS, or YR-retrotransposons, and Penelope-like elements. retroelement's ability to insert into internal genomic locations is conferred by the element-encoded enzymatic functions. PLEs are an enigmatic group of retroelements whose RTs share a common ancestor with telomerase reverse transcriptases (TERTs) PLEs are 3\u20134 kilobases (kb) in length; are framed by terminal repeats called pLTRs, which may be either direct or inverted. bdelloid rotifers are microscopic freshwater invertebrates that reproduce clonally, are highly resistant to desiccation and ionizing radiation. over 8% of its genes originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, or protists. Known TE families make up over 3% of the genome. TE detection pipelines perform poorly on A. vaga due to over-abundance of low-copy-number families with one or two members. most of the computer-generated Athena consensi were represented by RT and some adjacent sequences. the 5\u2032 boundaries were mostly formed by variably positioned 5\u2032-truncations of apparently longer units. screenshots from genome browser show custom tracks along scaffold 643 (A) and scaffold 184 (B) RTNC, catalytically inactive RT domains, are marked by arrows. other TEs on scaffolds are shown by boxed arrows. a genome-wide inventory of host-TE boundaries near Athena-like RTs in A. vaga reveals that the immediate RT environment does not always include such repeats. the RT is not always positioned near the 3\u2032-end of the entire unit, so that a series of intervening ORFs may appear between the RT and telomeric repeats at the TE-host junction. the added Terminon units can extend telomeres by tens of kb at a time. the additions can effectively counteract the ongoing terminal erosion. the dynamic nature of which is seen from comparison of the same A. vaga telomere. athena-like RTs are subdivided into three major clades with intact catalytic RT motifs. ILOM (I, L, O, and M families); NT (N, K, Q, P, R, and S/T families); and W (W, W1, and W2 families). PLE clades are marked with a bracket; clades with the programmed 1 frameshift are marked by #. the scaffold harbors the longest and most intact representative designated as the reference scaffold for each family. members of each family share common features and display between-clade variability in the RT ORF structure. y \u2014 3 \u2014 2 2 6 2 sCC 1 I.t W2 721-1061 Wb \u2014 \u2014 2 \u2014 1 1 \u2014 2 sCC 4 I.t W1 14; 660 Wb \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1(a) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 I.t R 660 R J \u2014 1 Rep-C 1 1 \u2014 3 sCC JR1-3 I.t P 1085; 588 P \u2014 frameshifts All members of the ILOM clade are characterized by a 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift. the 1 frameshift has a canonical structure formed by a heptanucleotide \u201cslippery sequence\u201d (typically T6G or T6C, translating into consecutive Phe residues), and a downstream pseudoknot or hairpin. members of the frameshifted ILOM clade have the frameshift and either one (V) or two (X) introns, while J lacks frameshifts and contains 2 or 4 introns. one of the intron positions is conserved between JVX, W, and NT clades. RTs and the associated CC-ORFs represent the obligatory components of these units (table 1; supplementary fig. S5, Supplementary Material online). Terminons can also harbor other ORFs, such as: Rep proteins most closely related to geminiviruses (circular ssDNA viruses of plants) ORFs with Enzymatic Functions and their Nonenzymatic Derivatives DEDDy/DEDDh single-Stranded 3\u2032-Exonucleases Eight Terminon families contain ORFs with homology to the DEDD-type (or DnaQ-like) 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease domain. these exonucleases perform 3\u2032-end processing of structured RNAs (RNase D, RNase T, exosome sub six of the Terminon-encoded exonucleases are of the DEDYD-type. the second D replaced with E (DEEYD); the remaining three derivatives in L1\u2013L3 families lack the acidic residues, indicating catalytic inactivity. an additional EHCHC motif in all families suggests conservation of the RNA binding function. GDSL-esterase-like ORFs in a subset of nonLTR retrotransposons (CR1, RTEX, and BRIDGE1) are thought to interact with membrane glycoproteins to facilitate entry or exit. some of them possess hydrolytic activity, while others lack such activity but preserve binding properties. a characteristic arrangement of Cys residues (CX2\u20134CX2CX33\u201335CX2CX10 CXCX59\u201363HX3C) does not match known Zn-finger-like profiles. a characteristic arrangement of Cys residues (CX2\u20134CX2CX33\u201335CX2CX10 CXCX59\u201363HX3C), partially matches that in the PLE Neptune clade. Rep-Nc lost the metal-binding HUH and the catalytic YxxK motifs. some of the families retain only the helicase moieties (Rep-C), but are not phylogenetically distinct and likely correspond to random 5\u2032-deletion products. the extreme N-terminus of RTs is clade-specific and comes in three variants. in the ILOM clade, it contains an excess of polar (S, T, Q, N, and Y) with some basic (K and R) residues. in the catalytically dead JVX clade, it displays a high content of acidic residues (D and E) at the N-termini. TM-ORFs are found in 12 Terminon families (table 1) and are typically small (200\u2013300 aa in length), with one (or rarely two) predicted TM domain of type I membrane topology. some of these ORFs also contain a predicted coiled-coil motif and/or cysteine residues which may form disulfide bridges. pLTR-like sequences can frame nonRT ORFs (e.g., DEDDy-like ORFs in the L family; supplementary fig. S6D, Supplementary Material online), and thus are not directly associated with RTs per se. pLTR conservation results from the presence of hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motifs described below. 97 HHR motifs were detected in A. vaga scaffolds. they were assigned to M, O, W1, N, Q, R, S, and T families. all members of the K, W2, and P families contain substitutions. Tandem duplication of the HHR-bearing segments is thought to be important for functionality of minimalist HHRs in a dimeric configuration. the AvPen3a HHR functions as a monomer. cis-acting elements could participate in trans-mobilization of genic regions unrelated to Terminons. foreign genes and members of host multigene families are often colocalized with telomeric repeats and HHRs. pLTRs can be positioned in two ways: intron-containing clades (NT-W) harbor the HHR motif near the 3\u2032-end. ORFs in different families can be very close, consistent with residing on a single long transcript rather than on individual transcriptional units. some ORFs exhibit evidence of circular permutation, for example, in WJ and JW families. some ORFs exhibit evidence of circular permutation, for example, in a circular intermediate. if broken, TEs or host genes are subject to end healing by telomeric repeats followed by Terminon attachment. if broken, TEs or host genes are subject to end healing by telomeric repeats followed by Terminon attachment. the missing gene part is not found at the other end of Terminons or elsewhere in the genome. a flanking gene is 3\u2032-truncated by terminal erosion and loses transcription termination signals. the resulting transcriptional readthrough would yield antisense Terminon transcripts, and hence RNA-mediated silencing. a 5-kb window yields a similar profile. Terminons are joined to host DNA via a different telomeric repeat hexamer (tcaccc)n while in Adineta sp. 11 junctions are mostly formed by a variant octamer (tcacaccc)n. phylogenetic analysis of Terminon ORFs confirms the presence of virtually every described family throughout each species\u2019 evolutionary history. a discordant phylogeny hints at the more transient character of their association with Terminons. the prevailing mode of inheritance for each Terminon family appears to be vertical. but they may also persist within genera and species via horizontal mobility. telomeric repeats yield elevated counts near TEs and foreign genes, but low counts near the bulk of host genes. over 50% of sequenced plasmid clones represented various parts of Terminons, although 20% were previously recognized as Athena-containing. bdelloid TEs (LTR, nonLTR, DNA TEs) form well-defined host-TE boundaries. piRNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small RNAs typically expressed from specialized loci termed piRNA clusters. they ensure silencing of homologous TEs in the germ line. the most surprising observation is the length of these units, which can exceed 40 kb, far more than any of the known retroelement types. a highly variable and diversified gene content is also not typical of retroelements. a series of intervening ORFs may appear between the RT and telomeric repeats at the host-TE boundary. the 5\u2032-boundaries in most cases are formed by stretches of telomeric repeats capping 5\u2032-terminally truncated copies. the athena-M family is somewhat of an exception: out of six contigs, only one had at the junction between the 3\u2032-pLTR and the downstream Athena-M copy. athena-like RTs are subdivided into three major clades with intact catalytic RT motifs: ILOM (I, L, O, and M families); NT (N, K, Q, P, R, and S/T families); and W (W, W1, and W2 families). telomeric repeats are added de novo to the proximal Ath-Y. alytically intact RTs can be confidently placed into N and W clades defined by RTs from A. vaga (supplementary fig.

S4A\u2013C, Supplementary Material online), and in the catalytically inactive X/V ORFs from the JVX clade (supplementary fig. S4B and D, Supplementary Material online). frameshifted ILOM clade is characterized by a 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift. the 1 frameshift has a canonical structure, formed by a heptanucleotide \u201cslippery sequence\u201d (typically T6G or T6C, translating into consecutive Phe residues) the frameshift site exhibits conservation in an otherwise rapidly evolving sequence context. it is present in all members of the W clade (supplementary fig. S4A\u2013C, Supplementary Material online) and in the catalytically inactive X/V ORFs from the JVX clade (supplementary fig. S4B and D, Supplementary Material online). athena-derived ORFs are characterized by complete loss of the RT catalytic residues. the core palm motifs RT3-5 (or A\u2013C) are wiped out in the context of an otherwise intact, intron-containing ORF. the highly diverse Y clade (supplementary fig. S3A, Supplementary Material online) entirely lacks the N-terminus corresponding to ORF1. intronless ILOM clade has the simplest ORF composition, with the most complex L3 family containing ORFs for a Rep (oppositely oriented), DEDDy endonuclease, two CC-ORFs, and a TM-ORF. the most diverse ORF composition is observed in the intron-containing W and NT clades, where some of the ORFs can occur in more than one variant per unit. ORFs with Enzymatic Functions and their Nonenzymatic Derivatives DEDDy/DEDDh single-Stranded 3\u2032-Exonucleases Eight Terminon families contain ORFs with homology to the DEDD-type (or DnaQ-like) 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease domain. two variants of the exoIII motif are known: YX3D (DEDYD) and HX4D (DEDHD DEDDy-like and GDSL-like Terminon ORFs exhibit similarity to ORF3\u2019s in bdelloid LTR retrotransposons. they contain five conserved blocks with a G-D-S-L or similar sequence with the catalytic Ser in the first block. most members of the L1\u2013L3 families encode these ORFs. GIY-YIG EN-Containing ORFs GIY-YIG EN are nickases, with a single active site that hydrolyzes DNA by a one-metal ion mechanism. the catalytic GIY-YIG module can be combined with various DNA-binding domains affecting DNA recognition and cleavage specificity. rep is critical for origin recognition and DNA cleavage/nucleotidyl transfer. the C-terminal domain possesses helicase activity and belongs to superfamily 3 helicases (S3H or SF3) only three of them carry the intact catalytic domain with two histidines (HxH or HUH) required for metal binding. there is no concordance between Rep-based and RT-based phylogenies between families. phylogenetic incongruence indicates that Reps are not integral components of Terminons, but rather can establish an association with them. a putative single-stranded DNA intermediate tends to propagate as a unit. deDDy exonucleases (ExoN) have also been found in nidoviruses. both deDDy-like and GDSL-like Terminon ORFs exhibit similarity to ORF3\u2019s in bdelloid LTR retrotransposons. most members of the L1\u2013L3 families encode these ORFs. analogous ORFs encode hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins in ssRNA viruses, for example, orthomyxoviruses (influenza C) and coronaviruses. GIY-YIG EN-Containing ORFs GIY-YIG EN are nickases, with single active site hydrolyzes DNA by a one-metal ion mechanism. a characteristic arrangement of Cys residues (CX2\u20134CX2CX33\u201335CX2CX10 CXCX59\u201363HX3C), with a CXC motif embedded within the GIY-YIG motif, partially matches that in the PLE Neptune clade. this array of Cys residues does not match known Zn-finger-like profiles. the families retain only the helicase moieties (Rep-C) they are not phylogenetically distinct and likely correspond to random 5\u2032-deletion products. there is no concordance between Rep-based and RT-based phylogenies between families (supplementary fig. S3C, Supplementary Material online). us of RTs is clade-specific and comes in three variants. in the ILOM clade, it contains an excess of polar (S, T, Q, N, and Y) with some basic (K and R) residues. in the catalytically dead JVX clade, it displays a high content of acidic residues (D and E) at the N-termini. TM-ORFs are found in 12 Terminon families (table 1) with one (or rarely two) predicted TM domain of type I membrane topology (single-pass N-exo/C-cyt) some of these ORFs also contain a predicted coiled-coil motif and/or cysteine residues which may form disulfide bridges. conserved CC-ORFs share a common ancestor either with NWT-like (with the KR-rich motif) or with JVX-like (DE-rich with a conserved SGTG motif) the central core occasionally shows similarity to DnaJ chaperones and surface antigens (pfam00226) pLTRs are found in 12 Terminon families (table 1) and are typically small (200\u2013300 aa in length) some of these ORFs contain a predicted coiled-coil motif and/or cysteine residues which may form disulfide bridges. the low conservation of TM-ORFs offers limited insight into their function other than possible interaction with membranes. pLTR conservation results from the presence of hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motifs described below. they were previously found in pLTRs of diverse PLEs, including athena-M in A. vaga (Cervera and de la pena 2014). they were previously found in pLTRs of diverse PLEs, including athena-M in A. vaga. a mutation in a different part of the catalytic core carries a mutation in a different part of the catalytic core. the substitution in the core catalytic HHR motif did not prevent successful expansion of the W2 family in A. vaga. cis-acting repeats represent the most conserved region of the pLTRs, possibly reflecting their role as cis-acting elements for 3\u2032-end recognition by RT. such cis-acting elements could participate in trans-mobilization of genic regions unrelated to Terminons. intron-containing clades (NT-W) harbor the HHR motif near the 3\u2032-end. the intron-less families (L,O,M) carry the HHR motif in the 5\u2032-terminal part of the pLTR. the expected cleavage site is always located in the center of the HHR. most Terminon pLTRs end in reverse-complement telomeric repeats (ACACCC)n forming the 3\u2032-boundary of the unit. pLTR-like sequences can frame nonRT ORFs (e.g., DEDDy-like ORFs in the L family; supplementary fig. S6D, Supplementary Material online) a total of 497 HHR motifs were detected in A. vaga scaffolds. they were assigned to M, O, W1, N, Q, R, S, and T families. all members of the K, W2, and P families contain substitutions. Tandem duplication of the HHR-bearing segments is thought to be important for functionality of minimalist HHRs in a dimeric configuration. the AvPen3a HHR functions as a monomer. the HHR-bearing repeats represent the most conserved region of the pLTRs. such cis-acting elements could participate in trans-mobilization of genic regions unrelated to Terminons. foreign genes and members of host multigene families are often colocalized with telomeric repeats and HHRs, as are Terminon ORFs. the directionality of ORFs within each unit implies transcript continuity is important for function, and distinguishes Terminons from self-synthesizing Polintons/Mavericks. some ORFs exhibit evidence of circular permutation, for example, in WJ and JW families. if a Terminon sequence is interrupted, it is usually by insertion of a different TE type (LTR, nonLTR, or DNA TEs) if broken, TEs or host genes are subject to end healing by telomeric repeats followed by Terminon attachment. if broken, TEs or host genes are subject to end healing by telomeric repeats followed by Terminon attachment. a flanking gene is 3\u2032-truncated by terminal erosion and loses transcription termination signals. the resulting transcriptional readthrough would yield antisense Terminon transcripts, and hence RNA-mediated silencing. a 5-kb window yields a similar profile. Terminons are joined to host DNA via a different telomeric repeat hexamer (tcaccc)n while in Adineta sp. 11 junctions are mostly formed by a variant octamer (tcacaccc)n. the apparent exception is the Rep-related ORFs, for which a discordant phylogeny hints at the more transient character of their association with Terminons. the prevailing mode of inheritance for each Terminon family appears to be vertical, but they may also persist within genera and species via horizontal mobility if a master copy is lost. telomeric repeats yield elevated counts near TEs and foreign genes. but low counts near the bulk of host genes in the core genome. accumulation of other TE types in subtelomeres is likely due to reduced deleterious effects of their insertion in these regions. Terminons occupy 1.1% of the A. vaga genome, increasing the known TE content from 3% to slightly over 4%. the characteristic 5\u2032-truncation in nonLTR retrotransposons is often ascribed to premature RT fall-offs in Terminons. some of the enzymatic ORFs (GIY-YIG, Rep) may have been recruited to facilitate transposition. others (GDSL esterases; RNase D-like DEDDy exonucleases) may assist in RNP assembly and/or evading host defenses. EN() PLEs code for a single nonframeshifted ca. 1000-aa CC-RT ORF. the nonenzymatic CC-ORFs with coiled-coil motifs resemble in organization the gag proteins of certain reverse-transcribing viruses. they are dependent on eukaryotic cell membranes for their replication. phylogeny of athena RTs does not favor the scenario of shorter PLEs having evolved by reduction of longer ones. a split of ancestral elements into individual subdomains may have been accompanied by combination of elements with different subdomains. a recent study associates HHR motifs with nonautonomous LTR retrotransposons, which may exist as short RNA circles. PLEs are unique in their capacity to retain introns after retrotransposition. retromobility of longer templates would be disfavored at internal chromosomal locations. a TE which can take advantage of such overhangs can additionally provide the host with extra means of terminal DNA addition. it would be of interest to investigate Terminon-encoded ORFs for enzymatic activities in vivo and in vitro. however such studies would be premature until transpositionally active copies are identified. the sequenced A. vaga strain has been maintained in the laboratory for over 25 years."}
