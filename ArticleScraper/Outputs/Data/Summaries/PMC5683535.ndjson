{"summary": "the concept of phylodynamics has evolved since the early 21st century. it extends its reach to slower-evolving pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, and to identification of influential factors in disease spread and pathogen population dynamics. the phylodynamic approach has become a fundamental building block for the development of comparative phylogenetic tools capable of incorporating epidemiological surveillance data into a single statistical framework."}
