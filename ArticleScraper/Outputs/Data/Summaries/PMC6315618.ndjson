{"summary": "mRNA degradation plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. cellular RNA decay machinery controls the fate of RNA transcripts. viruses completely rely on the host cell translation machinery. the 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap and the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail serve as a \u2018guardian\u2019 by protecting mRNA from the action of exoribonucleases. also serve as a \u2018guardian\u2019 by protecting mRNA from the action of exoribonucleases. the removal of the 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap by the decapping complex is triggered by the binding of the Lsm1\u20137 complex to the oligoadenylated 3\u2032 end. after decapping, the mRNA body is degraded by the 5\u2032 monophosphate-dependent 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease 1 (Xrn1) and the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonucleases (the exosome complex and Dis3 stress granules (SGs) are dynamic and non-membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments that arrest cytoplasmic mRNA, protein translation factors, and RNA binding proteins. it is known that cycloheximide (CHX) can bind mRNAs on polysomes and inhibit SG formation. flaviviruses, such as west Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DV), can inhibit SG formation through inducing relocalization and interaction of the cellular SG components. infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to a progressive reduction in the number of P body foci and relocalization of P body components to viral replication centers. BP could prevent the assembly of SGs through the 3C-proteinase-mediated cleavage of G3BP. cleavages of both eIF4GII and PABP have been proposed to contribute to host translation shutoff. induced translational arrest via decay of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs restricts viral infection. DCP1 interacts with Ge-1 of Drosophila melanogastersigma virus (DMelSV) and commits mRNA for degradation by removing the 5\u2032 cap. this RNA degradation pathway could help host cell against DMelSV infection. INT6 association and prevention of UPF1 recycling can lead to inhibition of the NMD pathway in HTLV-1-infected cells [31]. Molecular mechanisms of viruses indirectly destabilize cellular mRNAs. HTLV-1: human T- lymphotropic virus type 1; RVFV: Rift Valley fever virus. many viruses have evolved to counteract the interferon-induced RNase L pathway. the interferon-induced RNase L pathway is an innate immunity pathway. many viruses encode viral dsRNA-binding proteins to inhibit the activation of OAS. MHV68 muSOX ORF37 Unknown [38] RNA viruses ASFV ASFV-DP Ba71V D250R/Malawi g5R poly(A) RNA RPL23a [39] VACV decapping enzymes D9, D10 Cap-binding [40] IAV PA-X PA selectively targets host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed mRNAs. PA-X can selectively target host RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-transcribed mRNAs or RNAs within the nucleus. nsp1 encoded by SARS corona virus is a potent inhibitor of host gene expression. vhs possesses a potent mRNA-specific endonuclease activity. the redistribution of PABP may be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA processing and/or nuclear export. the pUL89 protein encoded by HCMV has been demonstrated as a large terminase subunit with endonucleolytic activity for genome cleavage. gamma-herpesviruses also encode a conserved viral alkaline exonuclease, such as SOX in KSHV, and muSOX EBV BGLF5 displays 40% homology to KSHV SOX at the amino acid level. BGLF5 can also induce a robust host shutoff in productively infected cells. MHV68-encoded muSOX also induces cellular and viral mRNA degradation upon productive infection. g5R binds to the RNA body rather than the cap, whereas VACV D10 binds both the methylated cap and the RNA body. the n-terminal region of the ASFV-DP protein has been shown to interact with poly(A) RNA of both viral and cellular RNAs. nsp1 encoded by -herpesvirus including HSV-1 contain a conserved virally UL41 gene that encodes a ribonuclease called the vhs. vhs possesses a potent mRNA-specific endonuclease activity that promotes endonucleolytic cleavage of viral and host mRNAs, instead of the host rRNA and tRNA. BP may be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA processing and/or nuclear export. pUL89 protein encoded by HCMV has been demonstrated as a large terminase subunit with endonucleolytic activity for genome cleavage. gamma-herpesviruses encoded a conserved viral alkaline exonuclease. EBV BGLF5 can degrade mRNAs of both cellular and viral origin, irrespective of polyadenylation. MHV68-encoded muSOX also induces both cellular and viral mRNA degradation upon productive infection. however, the association between muSOX and PABP remains unknown. g5R binds to the RNA body rather than the cap. VACV D10 binds both the methylated cap and the RNA body. cellular mRNA Degradation contributes to immunity evasion. vhs also targets the Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase cGAS/STING-mediated cellular DNA-sensing pathway by selectively degrading cGAS mRNA. vhs also targets the cytosolic DNA sensing and signaling pathway by selectively degrading cGAS mRNA. rabies virus steals host poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) to regulate expression of its glycoprotein to avoid host immune detection as it replicates and migrates to the central nervous system during infection. mRNA decay is important for regulation of cellular gene expression. host shutoff contributes to immune evasion by preventing the synthesis of proteins involved in antiviral immunity. viruses have evolved multiple strategies including encoding the viral counterpart of endonucleases, exonucleases, and decapping enzymes that can directly commandeer cellular mRNA turnover pathways."}
