{"summary": "the astV genome is 6.2\u20137.8 kb in size and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. ORF1a and ORF1ab encode nonstructural precursor proteins, nsp1a, and nsp1ab. the latter is translated via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism. intestinal tissue infected with AstV shows only minor histological changes. knowledge on pathogenesis of gastroenteric disease associated with AstV is still limited. in animals, knowledge about tissue tropism of AstV is even more limited. the shaking mink syndrome could be traced back to neurovirulent AstV infection (Blomstrom et al., 2010) a porcine AstV type 3 could be identified as the cause of disease in outbreaks of meningoencephalomyelitis in piglets. to date, there are 19 genotype species of Mamastrovirus (MAstV 1\u201319) recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in OvAstV, little is known about their diversity. their exact taxonomy is still pending. in total 164 fecal samples, derived from 56 sheep, 56 goats, 30 alpacas, 12 deer, four llamas, two bisons, two chamois, one giraffe, and one ibex were investigated. additional information on the animals and their health status was not available. the benzonase was inactivated by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to a final concentration of 5 mM. RNA extraction was performed with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. RNA extracts were stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until further analysis. the positive-negative cut-off was set at the cycle threshold (ct) value of 35. each RT-qPCR run was performed using a positive and negative brain tissue control as well as a water control. the same reverse primer was used as well as a mixture of PanAstV_forward_nested 1 and 2 (final concentration of 10 M) and 1 L of the first-round PCR-product as a template. temperature settings were the same as in the first PCR, but with 40 cycles instead of 30 cycles. scaffolds with a length over 5,550 nt and the three AstV-typical ORF including the ribosomal frameshift sequence between ORF1a and ORF1b were selected. a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed. phylogenetic analysis Capsid precursor sequences of 36 AstV strains were used for phylogenetic analysis. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. the model was chosen using the Find Best DNA/Protein Models option in MEGA 7. RT-qPCR was performed using a CFX96TM Real Time System on C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) in 10 L reactions according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions with a final concentration of 500 nM for each primer and 125 nM for each probe. all remaining 159 samples were re-tested using the RT-qPCR protocols. for each run, a non-template control was used as negative control. the respective confirmed samples served as target-specific positive controls. 500 L of fecal suspensions were centrifuged at 16,000g for 3 min. then centrifuged through Vivaclear MINI Clarifying filters. 280 L of the filtrates were treated with 2 L Benzonase (1U/L) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. BoAstV-CH15, OvAstV-CH16 and BoAstV-BH89/14 targeted the 3\u2032 end of ORF2 using the Geneious software package. each cycle, the fluorescence was measured with the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) channel. each RT-qPCR run was performed using a positive and negative brain tissue control as well as a water control. the PCR was carried out with the following setting: 2 min, 95 \u00b0C and 30 cycles each of 30 s, 95 \u00b0C; 30 s, 50 \u00b0C; 30 s, 72 \u00b0C and final elongation 7 min, 72 \u00b0C. the same reverse primer was used as well as a mixture of panAstV_forward_nested 1 and 2 (final concentration of 10 M) scaffolds with hits to AstV on nucleotide and/or amino acid level were considered valid astV hits. scaffolds with a length over 5,550 nt and the three astV-typical ORF including the ribosomal frameshift sequence between ORF1a and ORF1b were selected. a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed. each 3 L of purified PCR products was Sanger-sequenced using the BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. phylogenetic analysis Capsid precursor sequences of 36 AstV strains were used for phylogenetic analysis. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. RT-qPCR was performed using a CFX96TM Real Time System on C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) with the following cycle settings: 10 min, 45 \u00b0C; 10 min, 95 \u00b0C, and 40 cycles (15 s, 95 \u00b0C; 20 s, 95 \u00b0C; 20 s, 95 \u00b0C; 20 s, 95 \u00b0C; 20 s, 95 \u00b0C) all remaining 159 samples were re-tested using RT-qPCR protocols. positive controls showed ct-values on average of 22.73 (22.62\u201322.86) for boAstV-CH13 and 23.22 (21.74\u201324.61) for OvAstV-CH16. samples derived from sheep (n = 6: S1\u2013S6), goats (n = 8: G1\u2013G8), alpaca (n = 3: A1, A3, A4) and deer (n = 2: D2, D5) were defined as Pan-AstV RT-PCR-positive. RNA was de novo extracted, capsid-bound viral genomes were relatively enriched and free nucleic acids were depleted using benzonase treatment. the sequence mapped to the 3\u2032 half of ORF2 encodes the hypervariable part of the capsid precursor protein. nsp1ab sequences had an identity between 71.7% and 75.4% to the next best hit while the capsid protein precursor ranged from 57.5% to 73.7%. astV-G2.1 (MK404645.1) Bovine astrovirus JPN/Hokkaido11-55/2009 (LC047790.1) 76.6 BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido11-55/2009 (BAS29607.1) 75.4 BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido11-55/2009 (BAS29609.1) 73.7 CapAstV-G3.1 (MK404646.1) Bovine a the bioinformatics pipeline on nucleotide (full-genome) and amino acid (ORF 1ab, ORF2) level are presented separately. the 5\u2032 RACE did work and Sanger sequencing added to the 5\u2032 end of the respective almost full AstV scaffolds. this resulted in the completion of these four scaffolds, which were deposited on GenBank. CapAstV-G5.1 is very similar to the new OvAstV strains S5.1 (p-dist. 0.236) and S6.1 (p-dist. 0.027), clustering together in one clade of the phylogenetic tree. they cluster with a p-distance of 0.419 to the closest related AstV strain CcAstV-1/DNK/2010, which has been detected in feces from deer Filled rhombi indicate encephalitis-associated strains described in animals. Capsid protein precursor sequences translated from scaffolds with less than three identified ORFs are marked with an asterisk. all three sequences may be the recombinant. recombination event 3 was predicted to overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b. recombination event 1 was predicted for almost the entire ORF2. all five newly discovered AstV-candidates could be confirmed with the following ct-values: G2, 27.65; G3, 25.26; G5, 26.99; S5, 25.77; S6, 25.28. the non-template control remained negative for all targets. all negative controls were scored negative for BoAstV-CH13 and OvAstV-CH16. all 164 fecal samples had ct-values >35 or were reported as \u201cundetectable\u201d. the protocol was first applied to brain-extracts of boAstV-CH13 and OvAstV-CH16 positive animals. bp in size, showed AstV hits in the bioinformatics analysis on amino acid level. a 967 nt scaffold had a hit on the neurotropic BoAstV-CH13, isolate 42,799. the k-mer coverage of this scaffold was 4, which indicates relatively low RNA concentrations. s previously described in cattle (Nagai et al., 2015; Tse et al., 2011), deer (Smits et al., 2010) and takin (Guan et al., 2018) these findings clearly support the notion that these five scaffolds represent complete or almost complete viral genomes of novel MAstV strains. Bovine astrovirus B76-2/HK (HQ916317.1) 70.5 Bovine astrovirus B76-2/HK (YP_009010946.1) 73.8 Astrovirus deer/CcAstV-1/DNK/2010 (ADO67579.1) 59.0 OvAstV-S6.1 (MK404649.1) Sichuan takin astrovirus (NC_037655.1) 70.8 BoAstV phylogenetic comparison of all generated putative genomes to other known MAstV genotype species was conducted. for the goats, all three novel CapAstV strains clustered in different branches of the phylogenetic tree. the situation is similar to the one described in goats. phylogenetic analysis of novel small ruminant astroviruses using maximum likelihood method. 76 amino acid sequences of capsid precursor protein of selected astrovirus strains are marked with an asterisk. five new AstV sequences were analyzed together with selected strains for plausible recombination events. three putative recombination events were reported between the three strains. all five newly discovered AstV-candidates could be confirmed with ct-values: G2, 27.65; G3, 25.26; G5, 26.99; S5, 25.77; S6, 25.28. all five newly discovered astV-candidates could be confirmed with ct-values: G2, 27.65; G3, 25.26; G5, 26.99; S5, 25.77; S6, 25.28. 159 samples remained negative for primer-probe combinations G3.1, G5.1, S5.1, and S6.1. one sample originating from a goat scored positive for G2.1 (ct-value 29) this sample originated from the same holding as the sample G2. RT-PCR targets a conserved sequence at the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. RNA viruses, and in particular AstV, are predicted to undergo 3.4 103 mutations per nucleotide per genomic replication. fecal samples containing divergent AstV strains may have been classified as false negative. a total of 15 scaffolds covered at least a part of the ORF2. best hits were consistently to bovine strains and unexpectedly not to previously described ovine strains. a total of 15 scaffolds covered at least a part of the ORF2. novel sequences were discovered in sheep and goat, but also in deer. several sequences found in sheep show a clearly higher identity to bovine AstV than to ovine AstV. CapAstV-G2.1 belongs to the same genotype species as BoAstV/JPN/Hokkaido 11-55/2009. the high similarity between these viruses raises the question of transmission events between sheep and goats. similar recombination events have been proposed between a porcine AstV and HAstV-3. the transmission of fecal AstV between cattle and roe deer has been suggested. this study describes five novel AstV discovered in small ruminants. 0.5KB, xlsx) DOI: 10.7717/peerj.7338/supp-2 Supplemental Information 3.
