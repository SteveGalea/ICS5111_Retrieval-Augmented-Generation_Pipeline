{"summary": "6957 ill returned travellers presented in 2008 to EuroTravNet centres with a presumed travel associated condition. GI diseases accounted for 33% of illnesses, followed by febrile systemic illnesses (20%), dermatological conditions (12%) and respiratory illnesses (8%) there were 3 deaths recorded. 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were reported. a total of 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were reported. a broad spectrum of travel associated diseases were diagnosed at EuroTravNet core sites. ravnet.eu, a network of clinical specialists in tropical and travel medicine, was founded in 2008 to assist the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (ECDC) in the detection, verification, assessment and communication of communicable diseases that can be associated with travelling. data collected using a standardised format, are entered into the international geosentinel http://www.geosentinel.org database and analysed periodically [6] wait time is the shortest time in days from the end of the last travel trip to the date of initial clinic visit, regardless of which trip resulted in potential exposure. proportionate morbidity compares the number of cases of a specific diagnosis to all cases of ill returned travellers seen during the same time period [6]. data of 6957 ill travellers were analysed at EuroTravNet core sites in 2008. Demographic and travel data are respectively presented in Table 1 and Figure 2. Table 1. Proportion of different categories of travellers seen at EuroTravNet core sites in 2008. 6957 patients were seen at EuroTravNet core sites in 2008. three deaths were reported in the dataset. the first case was that of a 53 year old who died from dengue Shock syndrome. the second case is that of a 57-year old aid worker who visited liberia for three weeks. 12 29 11 6 44 70 44 176 177 9% 7% 12% 9% 11% 9% 14% 8% 9% 10% 7% 10% 8% Dermatologic 851 35 34 62 14 43 9 27 83 72 140 216 116 12% 30% 26% 18% 13% 13% 12% 37% 18% 11% 22% 12% 5% Respiratory 540 8 6 72 10 15 4 8 18 65 65 119 150 8% 7% 5% 21% 9% 5% 5% symptoms 283 4 6 8 2 13 3 3 38 14 19 91 82 4% 4% 4% 8% 2% 3% 5% 4% Other 347 6 11 18 6 17 5 7 27 24 42 107 77 5% 5% 8% 5% 6% 5% 6% 9% 6% 4% 7% 6% 4% Healthy 1056 1 3 3 5 5 1 0 8 9 4 36 981 15% 1% 2% 1% 0% 2% 1% 1% 2% 45% Total the majority of schistosomiasis cases (n = 113) did not have species specific diagnoses. there were 8 cases of Schistosoma mansoni (mostly from SSA) and 8 cases of S. haematobium (mostly from SSA) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 3% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% the majority of P. falciparum (87.1%) was acquired in SSA. 31 cases of P. vivax (mostly from south central Asia) and 25 cases of P. ovale (mostly SSA (Ivory Coast, Comoros, Guinea) and 14 cases of P. malariae (all from SSA) were diagnosed. spotted fever group rickettsioses accounted for the majority of cases. most were African tick bite fever acquired in south africa (n = 28), Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda, Namibia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Gambia. spotted fever was diagnosed in 4 cases, acquired in france (n = 2), Greece (n = 1) and Spain (n = 1). a total of 15 cases of leishmaniasis, 12 cutaneous, 1 mucocutaneous, and 2 visceral, were reported. the majority of cases, 66.7%, were acquired by tourists (n = 10) and imported into Germany (n = 9) the majority were exposed in Bolivia (95.7%;

two exposures were unascertainable. a total of 52 newly-diagnosed asymptomatic HIV cases were reported. most were exposed in Bolivia (95.7%; n = 90), and imported into Spain (97.9%; n = 92) by immigrant travellers (98.9%; n = 93) the cases of diphtheria were those of a 5 year old boy born and raised in Norway. the boy presented with fever and ear, nose and throat symptoms. his mother was positive on asymptomatic screening. most common diagnoses were respiratory illness (11%), gastro-intestinal illness (10.9%) and insect bites (5.7%) of those exposed in Eastern Europe (n = 145), the majority was VFRs (n = 83), travelling from where they lived in Switzerland (n = 72) or Germany (n = 20), to Serbia (n = 29), Russia (n = 20), Albania (n = 18), Macedonia (n = 12) and Croatia (n = 9) each EuroTravnet site has specific characteristics, and some could be considered as sentinel sites for diseases in specific categories of travelers returning from particular countries. surveillance in european travelers that encompasses a wide range of sites in Europe, including some with local specificity, is crucial to determine the epidemiology of travel-associated disease. a slight but steady decrease in the overall incidence rates of imported malaria in Europe has been observed. however, all evaluations of imported malaria show an increasing proportion of life-threatening P. falciparum malaria in certain risk groups. our data show VFRs returning from SSA continue to be those most at risk of P. falciparum. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection emerged in the field of travel medicine in 2005-2009. more than a thousand cases of imported CHIKV infection in travellers returning from la Reunion and other Indian Ocean islands have been reported by france, but also by many other European countries. in 2008, 1,607,699 were from endemic areas; of these, 239,942 are from Bolivia. up to 10% of Bolivian blood donors in Spain had antibodies to T. cruzi. this is illustrated by the majority of cases of CD reported by EuroTravNet in 2008 that were imported from Bolivia to Spain. cases of diphtheria may occur in unvaccinated travellers to endemic regions. vaccination against influenza should continue to be offered to all travellers at risk of complications from this illness. issue of the use of appropriate hemisphere influenza vaccine needs to be highlighted as a travel health issue. some travel destinations are associated with a higher proportionate morbidity for certain diseases. the country of origin of settled immigrants in Europe has a major role to play in disease profiles. individuals presenting with Chagas Disease to EuroTravNet core sites are usually migrants from Bolivia and P. falciparum malaria occurs predominantly in migrant families. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions VF contributed to data collection and analysis. authors' contributions VF contributed to the data collection and analysis. the Cambridge site gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre for their EuroTravNet activities."}
