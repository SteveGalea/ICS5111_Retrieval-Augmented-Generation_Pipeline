{"summary": "parechovirus A species within the Picornaviridae family comprises of 19 genotypes. human parechovirus 1 and 3 (HPeV1 and HPeV3, respectively) are most often detected in clinical samples. HPeV3 infects younger patients and often causes more severe diseases. heparan sulfate (HS) has been proposed to act as an attachment receptor for HPeV1 (Merilahti et al., 2016a). no HPeV3 receptors have been identified. HPeV1 was cultured in HT29 cells (human colorectal adenocarcinoma; ATCC, Manassas, VA) enterovirus 71 (EV71) 91-480 and enterovirus 68 (EV68) 947 were kindly provided by the national institute for public health and the environment. well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures from four individual donors were purchased from Epithelix S\u00e0rl (Geneva, Switzerland) Upon receiving the well-differentiated 24-well format transwell HAE inserts, they were cultured for 1 week at air-liquid interface before performing the infection experiments. EV68 was used as a control for apical infection and added only on the apical or basolateral surface of the HAE cultures. 40 micro liter of the RNA was reverse-transcribed and 5 l of the cDNA was used for real-time quantitative PCR. heparan sulfate was blocked by incubating the input virus with 5 mg/ml excess concentration of heparin sodium salt (H4784; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1-h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 prior to inoculation from either apical or basolateral surface. rabbit hyperimmune serum was raised against inactivated HPeV1 virions. secondary antibodies included donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa488 ab. all antibodies were diluted in 0.5% Tween20 and 3% BSA in PBS. confocal image stacks were deconvoluted by Huygens software package (SVI, Hilversum, the Netherlands) microarrays pre-processing and normalization HAE (donor 59701) cultures in five technical replicates were basolaterally inoculated with HPeV1 or HPeV3 (or mock) as described above and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. RNA samples were concentrated to 33 ng/l using Eppendorf Concentr the FeatureFilter function was used to remove probesets which lacked their respective entrezID annotations. the final expression set comprised 18618 genes and 14 samples. -values of log2 fold changes were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) differentially expressed genes were considered significant if their absolute fold change was greater than 1.2. p value was below 5e-2. the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of virus stocks was determined using the Reed and Muench method. well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures from four individual donors were purchased from Epithelix S\u00e0rl (Geneva, Switzerland) apical sampling was performed by adding 100 l of HBSS on the HAE culture apical surface followed by a 10-min incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and collection. 100 l of fresh culture medium was subsequently added to maintain the total culture medium volume at 600 l per insert. mAb solution was removed after 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. mAb solution was replaced with mAb solution containing the virus inoculum. virus binding to the host cell surface heparan sulfate was blocked. HAE culture membranes were then excised from the inserts. they were submerged in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at RT for permeabilization. all antibodies were diluted in 0.5% Tween20 and 3% BSA in PBS. microarrays pre-processing and normalization HAE cultures in five technical replicates were basolaterally inoculated with HPeV1 or HPeV3 (or mock) cultures were lysed and RNA extracted by High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche LifeScience, Penzberg, Germany) RNA samples were labeled and hybridized using the human Clariom S HT microarray platform according to the manufacturer's guidelines. the total number of samples used in the analysis included 14 array replicates distributed as follows; 5 mock, 5 HPeV1-infected and 4 HPeV3-infected. the FeatureFilter function was implemented in the geneFilter R package. infected HAE were different from mock and that gene expressions of HPeV1-infected HAE were different from mock. for each test, we included in the empirical Bayes estimation a mean-variance trend, to account for probes that are less reliable at lower intensities. qPCR analyses of the apical samples were in line with TCID50 titrations. significant increases in the viral RNA at the basolateral compartment was detected. but this was not reflected in the amount of infectious virus. TCID50 data could not be used to directly compare HPeV1 and HPeV3 replication efficiencies due to the different cell lines used in the assays. HPeVs preferentially infect p63 positive basal cells in the airway epithelium. we performed immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy of the HAE cultures. ciliated cell marker -tubulin, basal cell marker p63, and HPeV antibody were localized to the basolateral surface of the HAE. ins or heparan sulfate does not inhibit HPeV replication in HT29 cell line following V ITG blocking. neither of the tested concentrations of the function-blocking V ITG monoclonal antibody significantly inhibited HPeV1 (Figure 3A) or HPeV3 (Figure 3B) replication. HPeV1 and HPeV3 induce distinct transcriptional profiles in the airway epithelium. Virus replication in the HAE was confirmed by RT-qPCR. 370 of the shared genes were found to be differentially expressed upon both HPeV1 and HPeV3 infection, but to a significantly different level. HPeV3-specific DEGs were either up- or downregulated upon HPeV3 infection. expression of these genes remained at baseline in HPeV1 infection. many of the common DEGs that were more upregulated by HPeV3 than by HPeV1 were related to cell adhesion (leukocyte migration, extracellular matrix disassembly, heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, response to wounding) upregulated genes were most notably enriched in the NF-B signaling pathway activation (Figure 5C) each of the viruses induced both up- and downregulation of a number of apoptosis-associated genes (Figure 5C) in the human airway epithelium, we inoculated well-differentiated nasal HAE cultures with HPeV1 and HPeV3 either from the apical or the basolateral surface. titers from the basolateral compartment were low with no significant difference between the apical and basolateral inoculation. the respiratory picornavirus enterovirus 68 (EV68; data not shown) could be established with the respiratory picornavirus enterovirus 68 (EV68; data not shown). Figure 1. HPeV1 and HPeV3 replication kinetics in nasal HAE cell cultures. V integrins were clearly localized to the basolateral surface of the HAE. heparan sulfate was diffusely stained throughout the cultures. blocking of V ITGs does not inhibit HPeV replication in HAE model. HPeV1 replication was inhibited in HT29 cell line following V ITG blocking. function blocked ITGV mAb pretreatment (15 g/ml or 30 g/ml) or heparin pretreatment (5 mg/ml) of the virus inoculum. 370 of the shared genes were found to be differentially expressed upon both HPeV1 and HPeV3 infection, but to a significantly different level. these genes represent the common HPeV response. of the true common DEGs, 88 were upregulated and 52 downregulated when compared to the mock. dozens of common DEGs significantly more upregulated by HPeV3 than by HPeV1 were enriched for genes involved in immune responses and inflammation. many of the common DEGs that were more upregulated by HPeV3 than by HPeV1 were related to cell adhesion (leukocyte migration, extracellular matrix disassembly, heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, response to wounding) only six genes were found to be differentially expressed exclusively in HPeV1 infection. three of these genes were downregulated (alpha kinase 3 (ALPK3) and MSS51 mitochondrial translational activator (MSS51), and three were upregulated (ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B2 (ATP8B2) and tensin 3 (TNS3). caspases 8 and 10 were significantly more upregulated by HPeV3 than by HPeV1. the downregulated HPeV3-specific DEGs were annotated with various processes such as protein translation (translational initiation), RNA degradation (nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process) and cell metabolism. vaccinia, reo-, and measles viruses also exhibited apical shedding of the progeny virions. both HPeV1 and HPeV3 targeted the p63+ basal cells for replication. ITG subunits dimerize with V ITG and have been described as the high affinity receptors of HPeV1 in cell culture. both viruses were found to infect the same cell type. this is surprising since deletion of the RGD motif has been shown to abolish HPeV1 infectivity in cell lines. mAb and heparin concentrations have been reported to inhibit HPeV1 replication in monolayer cell cultures. differences in the cell lines and read-out methods may explain why we could not validate the previously reported heparin-blocking of HPeV1 in standard cell culture. adenovirus 5 (AdV5) was shown to promote re-localization of its coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAREx8), via inducing IL8 secretion of the immune cells, thus enabling apical entry. adenovirus 5 (AdV5) was shown to promote re-localization of its coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAREx8), via inducing IL8 secret ium in vivo involves M-cells, a specialized type of epithelial cells. reovirus has been shown to break epithelial barrier by transcytosis through M-cells. similar type of antigen-sampling cell has also been described in airway epithelium. gene expression data of human airway epithelium following human parechovirus infection. author contributions EK, AS, and KW designed the experiments. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
