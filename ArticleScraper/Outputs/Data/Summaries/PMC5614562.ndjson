{"summary": "human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more people than does HV. 240 million people are chronically infected. current therapies are inadequate for treating chronic HBV infection. immunotherapies based on human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have achieved remarkable clinical success in treating multiple cancers and various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. more recent efforts have shown that chronic viral infectious diseases can be treated via mAb-based immunotherapy. novel nAb-based immunotherapy may represent a new modality for curing chronic HBV infection. infection of HBV is mediated by HBV envelop proteins, which are the main target of neutralizing antibodies. the large (L) envelope protein of HBV has a preS1 domain at the N-terminal end of S domain and plays a pivotal role in HBV and HDV infections. nAb by antibody engineering resulted in a more potent anti-preS1 nAb, 2H5-A14, with picomolar neutralizing activity against the major epidemic genotypes of HBV (B, C, and D) studies with 2H5-A14 Fc mutant in the animals revealed that Fc-mediated immune effector functions are largely responsible for the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14. 2H5 and m1Q were more potent in neutralizing HBV and HDV than m1Q. the cells were infected with 500 mge of HDV in the presence of the test nAbs or matched isotype control Ab. the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated mAb, 4G5. 2H5 is shown in ribbon and residues 20\u201327 of preS1 (genotype C) are shown in sticks. carbon atoms are colored in cyan for VH of 2H5, magenta for VL of 2H5 and yellow for the preS1 peptide. HBV envelope proteins:Small (S), middle (M) and Large (L) proteins. all three proteins share the same C-terminal S domain (226 aa) the L protein has an extra preS1 (108 aa or 119 aa depending on genotypes) and a preS2 (55 aa) domain. 2H5, m1Q, and T47, bound to all three peptides. #71, and #76 bound to NC36b and 47b but not m47b. #15 bound to m47b and 47b, but not NC36b. the 2H5 scFv and the 59C peptide were co-expressed in E. Coli. the complex structure was determined by molecular replacement. residues 20\u201327 of the 59C peptide showed well-ordered electron density were modeled. atoms 3747 Protein 3519 Water 227 Ion 1 Rwork 0.231 (0.292) Rfree 0.283 (0.356) Mean B factor (2) 14.5 Rmsd bond length () 0.002 Rmsd bond angles (\u00b0) 0.555 Five CDR loops (HCDR1-3, LCDR1 and LCDR3) are involved in direct binding to the 59C peptide. 2h5 scFv HCDR1 HCDR2 HCDR3 HCDR3 CDR-L1 CDR-L3 A38 R55 Y57 R59 G107 Q108 M109 G113 Y37 Y38 Y107 PreS1 F23 D20 P21 A22 F23 A22 F23 F23 F23 F23 F23 A25 D20 F23 P21 N26 S27 D20 P21. residue 24 in the 2H5 epitope a de novo HDV infection mouse model was used to evaluate the neutralization activity of 2H5 in vivo. the transgenic expression of human NTCP (hNTCP-Tg) in mouse liver supports acute HDV infection mediated by HBV envelope proteins. however, 2H5 treatment was not able to completely block HDV infection in mouse livers. ELISA assays revealed that the four top nAbs had about 100-fold improvement in binding activity relative to 2H5. further neutralization assays revealed that, relative to 2H5, these four nAbs all had about 20-fold increases in neutralizing activity against HBV and about 100-fold increases against HDV. 2H5-A14 inhibited the binding of FITC-labeled preS1 to HepG2-hNTCP cells in a dose-dependent manner. the neutralization mechanism of 2H5-A14 likely involves blocking of viral entry by interfering with the binding of NTCP and preS1. 2H5-A14 showed superior activity (C) and potently neutralized HDV infection of HepG2-hNTCP cells (D) and HBV infection of PHHs (E). the neutralization assays were performed similarly as in Figure 1A\u2013B. the percentage of HBeAg inhibition at dpi seven is shown in panel (B); the staining of HDV delta antigens at seven dpi is shown in panel (C). the three CDRs of the VH were defined using the IMGT database. genomes B, C, and D represent the major epidemic genotypes. 2H5-A14 potently neutralized all three of these genotypes. we also compared the potency of 2H5-A14 to other agents known to block HBV entry. ELISA binding assays showed that 2H5-A14 bound weakly to a preS1 peptide variant containing the epitope-forming sequnces of both the F and H genotypes of HBV. 2H5-A14 likely neutralizes the vast majority (>95%) of HBV virus strains with remarkable potency. 3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg doses reduced HDV titers by 99.4% and 98.5%, respectively. even a high dose of HBIG (100 IU/kg) only reduced HDV titers by 90%, which was still insufficient to prevent HDV infection. blood samples from all the mice were collected at the indicated time points. horizontal dotted lines indicate the reliable detection limits. intrahepatic HBsAg and HBcAg levels were detected by specific antibodies conjugated with Alkaline phosphatase (AP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), respectively. mice were challenged with 1 109 GE HBV (genotype B) per mouse on day 1, followed by a single dose of 2H5-A14 IP either one day before viral challenge. HBIG were included as a control group for the 2H5-A14 therapeutic group. all mice were sacrificed at 37dpi. the HBsAg and HBcAg levels in liver tissues were detected by IHC. one set of images represents one mouse of each group. the representative images from each group are also included in this figure. biweekly 2H5-A14 treatment (20 mg/kg) greatly reduced all of the virological markers in sera as compared to infection-only control and to the HBIG treatment groups. by the end of the experiment, 2H5-A14 treatment resulted in three log reductions in the HBV DNA and RNA levels relative to the two control groups. hFRG mouse model dissected mechanism-of-action of 2H5-A14. NK cells express FcRIIIa (CD16) and mediate ADCC. macrophages express all classes of FcRs and can perform both ADCC and ADCP. 2H5-A14 binding was used as the control cell line. NK cell-mediated ADCC requires the presence of the 2H5-A14 epitope on target cells. NK92-MIhCD16 was used as effector cells. ADCP activity was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. the phagocytosis index was determined as the number of CFSE-positive target cells per 100 macrophages. the means and error bars were from two independent experiments. 2H5-A14 is a mutant of the Fc region that binds to target cells similar to wild type 2H5-A14. similar binding activity of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA against HBV infection of HepG2-hNTCP cells. 2H5-A14-DANA lost binding activity with FcRIIIa. 293 F-59C and 293F-59C-mut cells were labeled with CFSE fluorescent dye prior to mixing with macrophages. the target cells, 293 F-59C or 293F-59C-mut, were CFSE-labeled as in panel A, and mouse macrophages were labeled with F4/80-Alex Fluor 647 prior to mixing with target cells. 2H5-A14 variant (2H5-A14-DANA) could still bind to CHO-59C cells and preS1 peptides, and neutralize HBV infection to the same extent as 2H5-A14. 2H5-A14-DANA variant could not induce ADCC activity. 2-hNTCP cells uninfected by HBV were spared from NK cell killing. we then examined if 2H5-A14 can mediate ADCC and ADCP via macrophages. the results were obtained using mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. 2H5-A14 has very weak binding activity to both human- and mouse C1q. the therapeutic effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection is dependent on Fc-mediated effector functions. hFRG mice with a medium level of humanization were challenged with HBV on day 1. treatment was administered twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks. the HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg level increased over time in the control group. in the 2H5-A14-DANA group, the average HBV DNA titer and the HBsAg levels were 3.8108/mL and 4.0104 IU/mL. both 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treated mice had comparable serum antibody concentrations at all time points tested. the levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg at all tested time points were all higher than those at the starting point of treatment. intrahepatic HBsAg was detected by a specific anti-HBsAg mouse mAb followed by HRP-anti-mouse secondary Ab. nuclei were stained blue by Hematoxylin. each image shown represents the staining result for one mouse of each group. quantify HBV cccDNA by qPCR using specific primers. the cccDNA copy number shown in the Y-axis is the relative value normalized to 1000 copies of hNTCP gene in 50 ng total DNA samples. only two sets of images from two mice are shown for the control group. one mouse in this group was found dead prior to the scheduled euthanasia. 2H5-A14-treated mice had much lower cccDNA copy numbers than the other two groups. results demonstrate the potent in vivo anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14. comparison of effects of 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA treatments side by side clearly proves that the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 results only in part from Fab-mediated neutralization. nAbs recognized four unique epitopes, represented by #71, 2H5, m1Q and #15, respectively. the epitopes of 2H5 and m1Q are closer to the C-terminus of RBS. the epitopes of 2H5 and m1Q are more closer to the C-terminus of RBS. secreted HBeAg and HBsAg levels in sample supernatants were measured at 7 days post infection (dpi) the HBV neutralization activity is here presented as the percentage of inhibition of secreted HBeAg and HBsAg. each mouse was sacrificed with 1.47 1010 genome equivalents (GE) of HDV. hNTCP transgene expression (on the right Y-axis) in liver tissues were measured by qPCR. each square represents one mouse; squares of the same color indicate data from the same mouse. the other peptides shown were used for antibody binding activity assays and epitope mapping, and are based on HBV genotype C. the NTCP receptor binding site (RBS) of the preS1 peptide and the epitopes of four nAbs are indicated. mutant peptides of preS1, Leu19, Asp20, Pro21, or Phe23 were mutated to alanine in LN16 (a 16-mer pre S1 peptide) and tested for competition activity against the binding of 2H5 to m47b. ELISA solved the structural basis of 2H5-preS1 binding. values in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell. preS1-2H5 scFv data collection and refinement statistics. a wild-type synthesized 16-mer preS1 peptide could efficiently compete with the full-length preS1 peptide for binding to 2H5. however, three 16-mer variants of the preS1 peptide that had a key residue (Asp20, Pro21, or Phe23) mutated to alanine failed to compete. 2H5 epitope is highly conserved among HBV genotypes. alanine substitution of preS1 Leu19 also reduced binding competition activity. 2H5 can potentially provide broad protection against the vast majority of HBV genotypes. ELISA assays revealed that the four top (2H5-31, 2H5-32, 2H5-A14, and 2H5-A21) nAbs all had about 20-fold increases in neutralizing activity against HBV and about 100-fold increases against HDV. subsequent differential scanning calorimetry experiments with the four nAbs revealed good thermostability of 2H5-A14. 2H5-A14 is a potent and broadly-neutralizing nAb against HBV infection that acts by blocking the binding of preS1 with the HBV receptor NTCP Competition ELISA assays. 2H5-A14 targets the same epitope as does 2H5-A14 binding activity. this epitope is in close proximity to, but does not overlap, the receptor NTCP-binding site of preS1. 2H5-A14 neutralized HBV genotypes B, C, and D (B) 2H5-A14 also neutralized HDV infection of HepG2-hNTCP cells (D) and HBV infection of PHHs (E). the neutralization assays were performed similarly as in Figure 1A\u2013B. for HDV neutralization assay, the phage-scFv Abs were tested at 2.65 1012/mL. for HDV neutralization assay, the nAbs were tested at 1 nM. nAbs in their full-length human IgG1 forms were tested for binding to 7.8 nM NC36b peptides. 2H5-A14 neutralization of patient serum derived HBV viruses, and sequence variation analysis of the 2H5-A14 epitope among HBV genotypes. compared potency of 2H5-A14 to other agents known to block HBV entry. ELISA binding assays showed that 2H5-A14 bound weakly to a preS1 peptide variant containing the epitope-forming sequnces of both the F and H genotypes of HBV. 2H5-A14 also had about 200-fold stronger neutralizing activity against HBV than did KR127 and 50-fold stronger anti-HBV activity than did either m47-D or m47. 2H5-A14 prevented HDV infection in a mouse model with chimeric NTCP. residues 84\u201387 of mNTCP have been replaced by their hNTCP counterparts. a 15 mg/kg dose of 2H5-A14 completely blocked HDV infection. even a high dose of HBIG only reduced HDV titers by 90%. hFRG mice were challenged with 1 109 GE HBV (Genotype B) on day 0. A single dose of 15 mg/kg 2H5-A14 was IP administered one day before viral challenge. HBIG (40 IU/kg) treatment was used as a control. human albumin levels at different time points post infection were quantified using a human serum albumin ELISA kit (Sigma) the horizontal dotted lines indicate the reliable detection limit of human albumin. southern blotting of HBV total DNA in liver tissues. the total DNA extracted from liver tissues was loaded at 500 ng per lane. cccDNA was extracted using a Hirt protein-free method. the hFRG mice used in this experiment had high level of humanization. all of the treatments began at five dpi and lasted until 21 dpi. secreted HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA, and RNA levels were measured periodically from serum samples. liver tissues from 2H5-A14 prophylaxis group animals had no detectable HBsAg and HBcAg or HBV DNA, cccDNA, or RNA. liver tissues from 2H5-A14 treatment had greatly reduced HBsAg and HBcAg. 2H5-A14 mediated ADCC and ADCP but not CDC. 2H5-A14 mediated ADCC and ADCP but not CDC. 2H5-A14 induced ADCC via NK cells. NK92-MIhCD16 line was used as effector cells. the ratio of effector cells to target cells (E:T) was 6:1. the ADCC activity was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. the target cells used were suspension 293F cells expressing the 2H5-A14 epitope or the mutant epitope. CHO-59C cells express the epitope of 2H5-A14 on the cell surface. CHO-59C-mut cells express a binding-deficient 2H5-A14 epitope mutant (D20A) on their surface. 2H5-A14-DANA (D265A/N297A) is a 2H5-A14 mutant of the Fc region that binds to target cells similarly to wild type 2H5-A14. 2H5-A14 or 2H5-A14-DANA antibodies were captured on a CM5 chip via Protein A/G that had been covalently immobilized on the chip. Binding kinetics was evaluated using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. 2H5-A14 did not induce CDC against target cells in the presence of human complement sera (10%) (Sigma) all the samples were tested in triplicates and the antibodies were tested at 10 g/mL. the 2H5-A14-DANA variant caused ADCC against HBV-infected cells. both ADCP and ADCC were observed following treatment with wild type 2H5-A14 but not with the 2H5-A14-DANA variant. similar results were obtained using BMDMs as effector cells. 2H5-A14 can kill target cells via Fc-FR interaction-dependent effector functions such as ADCC and ADCP. in the presence of complement sera, 2H5-A14 did not cause cell lysis of CHO-59C cells. however, 2H5-A14 does not induce CDC against target cells. hFRG mice with a medium level of humanization were challenged with HBV on day 0. Treatment was administered twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks. the hFRG mouse model supports sustained HBV infection. treatment with 2H5-A14 resulted in reductions in both HBV DNA titer and HBsAg levels over time, starting from the beginning of the treatment and continuing through the treatment window. the results showed that 2H5-A14 treatment not only efficiently suppressed the spread of HBV in mice, but could gradually reduce the extent of an established HBV infection over time. blood samples were collected at the indicated time points for measuring HBV DNA titers and/or HBsAg levels in serum. the antibody concentrations in serum samples were measured by ELISA using antibody standards with known concentrations. DNA samples prepared from normal mouse livers were used as a negative control. 100 pg each of 3.2 kb, 2.1 kb, and 1.7 kb HBV DNA fragments were used as DNA markers. rcDNA (relaxed circular DNA), cccDNA, and ssDNA (single-strand DNA) intermediates are labeled. Symbols of the same shape and color represent data from the same mouse. the base line levels of human albumin in serum for each mouse were measured at dpi 80 for all mice. liver tissues from 2H5-A14-treated but not 2H5-A14-DANA-treated mice had greatly reduced levels of HBsAg (IHC assay) compared to the control mice, no significant histopathological changes were observed. the epitope of 2H5-A14, a receptor-binding proximal region centered by Phe23, is likely unsusceptible to escape mutation. nAbs against the HBV small (S) envelop protein (HBsAg) constitute the major protective components of the widely-used recombinant HBV vaccine and of the post-exposure prophylactic blood-derived HBIG. high levels of circulating HBsAg-containing non-infectious subviral particles are commonly present in the blood of chronically-infected HBV patients. it has been assumed that HBsAg can act as a decoy that prevents anti-HBsAg nAbs from effective targeting of infectious virions. formation of circulating immune complexes that may lead to immune complex disease also remains a potential risk. 2H5-A14 demonstrated impressive therapeutic efficacy against HBV infection in two independent mouse studies using liver-humanized hFRG mice. at present, there is no immune-competent small animal model that supports natural and long-lasting HBV infection. NK cells are generally considered to be the main effector cells in mediating ADCC to induce apoptosis in target cells. the observed effector functions in hFRG model thus cannot be attributed to NK cells but to the remaining immune effector cells in these mice. macrophages exert their cytotoxic functions via diverse mechanisms such as ADCC, ADCP, etc. the cells involved could be identified via the selective depletion of macropahges or neutraphils (Daley et al., 2008) using specific reagents targeting each of them in hFRG mice. in humans, the mechanisms underlying HBV control is only partially understood. harnessing immune control to combat chronic HBV infection is promising but remains a challenge. 2H5-A14 elicits its Fc-dependent effect via activating immune cells in liver to exert its anti-viral effect. serological HBsAg reduction, and eventually HBsAg loss, is considered as a critical step toward a \u2018functional cure\u2019. 2H5-A14 inhibits NTCP binding by recognizing a structurally-defined and highly-conserved epitope located in close proximity to the RBS of preS1. the effector functions contribute substantially to the anti-viral effect of 2H5-A14 against HBV infection in vivo. human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7 (RRID:CVCL_0336), Raji (RRID:CVCL_0511) and Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO (RRID:CVCL_0213) were from the American Type Culture Collection. m47b, a lipopeptide comprised of amino acids 2\u201348 of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV L protein with a biotin modification at its C-terminus. a human non-immune scFv (single-chain fragment of variable domain: VH-linker-VL) antibody library was used for selection against the synthesized NC36b or m47b preS1 peptides. 109 clones with unique sequences were identified. clones were either produced as purified phage-scFv particles or converted to full-length human IgG1s. top six clones were selected based on their binding and HBV/HDV neutralization activities. ELISA binding assay 1 g/mL of streptavidin in phosphate buffered saline was harvested 3\u20135 days after transfection. biotin-labeled peptides (NC36b or m47b) at various concentrations in PBS (100 L per well) were then captured onto the plates by incubating at 4\u00b0C overnight or 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. competition ELISA assays were performed in a manner similar to the aforementioned binding ELISA assays. different short peptides at serially diluted concentrations were mixed with 0.5 nM (75 ng/mL) of IgG1 antibody and added to the ELISA plates to compete for the binding of Abs to the captured peptides. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL17U (Wang et al., 2015) of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. the structure was determined at 2.5 resolution by molecular replacement in Phaser. initial model from molecular replacement was further refined in Phenix. about 200 multiplicities of genome equivalents (mge) of HBV mixed with Abs were inoculated with HepG2-hNTCP cells in the presence of 5% PEG8000 and incubated for 16 hr. cells were then washed three times with media and maintained in PMM. images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse Ti Fluorescence Microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope. the neutralization activity against HDV was determined based on the stained delta antigen amount (number of infected cells) antibodies at optimal concentrations were then captured on the chip. a buffer injection served as a negative control. surfaces were regenerated with 10 mM pH2.0 Glycine-HCl solution. expression plasmid was first constructed by inserting preS1-59C coding DNA into the C-terminal (CT) extracellular domain of the VAMP2 gene that encodes a single-pass type IV transmembrane protein. the NT of VAMP2 is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. for ADCC, the cytolysis was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release following the instructions of a CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit. percentage cytotoxicity was calculated following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. s was recorded with a Zeiss Pascal Confocal System. about 200 macrophages were counted per sample. cells were flushed with a syringe from the tibia and femurs of C57BL/6 mice. target cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI medium (without FBS) containing testing antibodies (10 g/mL) and plated in a 96-well U-bottom plate at 2.5 104 cells/well. cytolysis was calculated following the instructions of the kit. sidues 84\u201387 of mNTCP replaced by their human counterparts were used for evaluating 2H5-A14 and 2H5-A14-DANA. for all experiments, homozygotes at 8\u20139 days after birth were used. animals were hosted in animal facility of NIBS, Beijing. the edited chimeric m-hNTCP qPCR primers are forward primer: 5\u2032-GGTCTTTCGGCTGAAGAAC-3\u2032; backward primer: 5\u2032-CATGGCCAGGGTGAAGAGG-3\u2032. hFRG mice were generated commercially (Yecuris, Tualatin, OR) as described previously (Bissig et al., 2010b) 2H5-A14 or HBIG were administrated every three days by IP injection. the mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment at 37 dpi. one portion of the liver tissues was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately upon harvest. blood samples were collected periodically until dpi 89. one mouse was found dead with an undetermined cause at dpi 83. eight mice were euthanized at dpi 89, and the liver tissues were harvested.

PBMCs were differentiated by 20 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 9 days. these cells were similarly established as CHO-59C and CHO-59C-mut. they were harvested and used as target cells at 30\u201348 hr after transfections. cells were collected and washed by PBS and filtered through a 40 M strainer. to differentiate the cells into BMDMs, they were resuspended in DMEM medium. the differentiated BMDMs were labeled with a 1:200 dilution of anti-mouse. sera derived from rabbit or human (Sigma-Aldrich) were then added to the wells containing the target cells and antibodies. after 2 hr (for rabbit serum) or 4 hr (for human serum) incubation at 37\u00b0C, the supernatants in each well were recovered and detected LDH release using a CytoTox 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit.
