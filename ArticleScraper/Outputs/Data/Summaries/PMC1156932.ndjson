{"summary": "dsRNA (Poly IC) is a well-described synthetic agent mimicking acute viral infection. the lungs were then harvested at designated timepoints to characterize the elicited chemokine response and resultant lung injury following dsRNA exposure. ligands/CXCR2 interaction by pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice with an anti-CXCR2 neutralizing Ab also significantly attenuated neutrophil sequestration and lung injury. the biological axis is critical during the pathogenesis of dsRNA-induced lung injury relevant to acute viral infections. dsRNA has been shown to induce activation of the neutrophil chemoattractant, interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) in human subjects in vivo. elevated tracheal IL-8/CXCL8 levels and neutrophil accumulation are found in airways of patients with asthma, COPD, and viral infection. LB/c mice were used to measure neutrophil and chemokine responses. we then blocked this response by pretreating animals with antibodies to specifically neutralize neutrophil recruitment in a chemokine-dependent manner. we then blocked this response by pretreating animals with antibodies to specifically neutralize neutrophil recruitment. in multiple intradermal sites with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) followed by at least 3 boosts of CXCR2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) the antibody has been shown to be neutralizing using both in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis assay and in vivo. eally inject single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) using a modification of a previously described method. mice were anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. then, under sterile conditions, the anterior neck soft tissue was dissected to expose the trachea. the skin was apposed and closed using tissue adhesive. retrieved solutions were centrifuged at 900 g for 15 min. cell-free supernatants were assayed by specific ELISAs. cell-free supernatants were assayed by specific ELISAs. cell-free supernatants were assayed by specific ELISAs. total RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR Total cellular RNA from lung tissue was isolated as previous described [30,31] cDNA was amplified and quantified using the TaqMan 7700 Sequence Detection System. primers were used for murine CXCL1, murine CXCL2/3, murine CXCR2 and a housekeeping gene18S. the difference in threshold cycles for a target (i.e., CXCR2) and an endogenous reference (i.e., housekeeping gene 18S) is given by 2-CT. both CXCR2 from dsRNA-treated and ssRNA-treated controls are normalized to 18S. the calculation of 2-CT then gives a relative value when comparing the target with the calibrator. the trachea, mainstem bronchi, and surrounding mediastinal structures were removed. Evans blue was extracted from pulmonary tissues after homogenization in 1 ml of 0.9% normal saline. the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 2000 G for 30 min. flat-bottomed 96 well microtiter plates were coated with 50 l/well of capture antibody to murine KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3. plates were washed three times and 50 l/well of detection antibody for murine KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 antibodies added. plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 were specific in our sandwich ELISA without cross-reactivity to a panel of cytokines. single cell suspensions (5 106 cells /ml) were stained with Abs: Tricolor-conjugated anti-murine CD45 (Caltag Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), FITC-conjugated anti-murine MOMA-2 (macrophage surface marker; Seratec, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, Poly IC) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA, Poly C) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. and reconstituted in sterile normal saline (20 g/l) and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to use. anti-CXCR2 antibodies have been used previously to block mouse CXCR2 in vivo. the anti-CXCR2 antibody has been shown to be neutralizing using both in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis assay and in vivo by abrogating the influx of neutrophils into the peritoneum of normal mice. polyclonal goat anti-murine CXCR2 was produced by the immunization of a goat with a peptide containing the ligand-binding sequence Met-Gly-Glu-Phe-Lys-Val-Asp-Val-Asp-Lys-Val-Asp-Val-Asp-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Ser-Gly of CXCR2. the goat was immun mice were anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia prior to replacement into their cages. mice were euthanized using intraperitoneal Pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and a heparinized sample of blood was harvested. the thoracic cavity was then exposed and lungs were perfused free of blood with 1 ml 0.9% normal saline. a 26 gauge butterfly needle was used to cannulate the trachea and bronchoalveolar lavage. tissue sections were washed with TRIS-buffered saline and incubated for 60 min. tissue sections were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to streptavidin. tissue sections were immersed in sterile water, counterstained with Lerners hematoxyin, and cover slipped using an aqueous mounting solution. arithmetic formula for the CT method is the difference in threshold cycles for a target, (i.e., CXCR2) and an endogenous reference (i.e., housekeeping gene 18S) the amount of target normalized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCR2 in dsRNA-treated animals) is given by 2-CT [40,41]. extravasation of Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) into the extravascular compartment was used as a quantitative measure of lung injury and changes in microvasculature permeability. each animal received 20 mg/kg Evans blue (pH 7.34) by tail vein injection 3 h before sacrifice. trachea, mainstem bronchi, and surrounding mediastinal structures were removed. flat-bottomed 96 well microtiter plates were coated with 50 l/well of capture antibody to murine KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3. plates were washed three times and 50 l/well of detection antibody for murine KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 antibodies added. plates were washed three times and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate added. the plates were read at 450 nm in an automated microplate reader. standards were 1/2-log dilutions of either KC/CXCL1 or MIP-2/CXCL2/3 from 100 ng to 1 pg/ml (50 ul/well) s were analyzed using cellQuest 3.2.1f1 software (BD Immunocytometry Systems) data were analyzed using the Microsoft\u00ae Excel 2000 statistical package (Microsoft Corporation, USA) three group comparisons were evaluated by the ANOVA test with the post hoc analysis (i.e. Bonferroni/Dunn) dsRNA induces lung neutrophil infiltration Mice treated with intratracheal dsRNA were noted to have significant intraparenchymal and airway leukocyte infiltration at 72 h following treatment. no significant differences in cellular infiltrates were noted among the histopathologic groups at earlier timepoints 4, 12, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb. mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb. mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb. mice were pretreated control Ab or anti-PMN Ab at times -24, 0, 24, and 48 h following IT dsRNA treatment. DsRNA induces elevated KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 mRNA and protein levels since neutrophil influx was shown to result in lung injury in dsRNA-treated lungs. quantitative levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 protein, respectively, in the lungs at 72 h. expression of CXCR2 mRNA paralleled its ligand expression, neutrophil sequestration, and lung injury at 72 h following dsRNA treatment. inhibition of CXCR2 inhibits infiltration of neutrophils and attenuates dsRNA-induced lung injury. mice were passively immunized with specific neutralizing anti-murine CXCR2 or with control antibody at -24 h. results showed that BAL neutrophil counts from animals that received anti-CXCR2 Ab were significantly reduced as compared to control animals that received normal goat serum. in vitro studies in human epithelial cells have demonstrated that dsRNA induces the generation of chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment. we performed in vivo studies using a murine model system of intratracheal dsRNA-induced inflammation and injury. no significant differences in cellular infiltrates were noted among the histopathologic groups at earlier timepoints 4, 12, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. dsRNA induces lung neutrophil recruitment compared to controls. dsRNA-treated mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb or corresponding control at times -24, 0, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. mice were passively immunized with specific anti-mouse Ly-6G mAb or corresponding control at -24 h. chemokines KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 are known to have neutrophil chemoattractant properties. dsRNA treatment resulted in significant increases in lung KC/CXCL1 mRNA levels as well as in protein levels from whole lung homogenates and BAL protein from dsRNA-treated lungs. mRNA levels and lung protein expression of MIP-2/CXCL2/3 were also significantly elevated. quantitative levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 protein, respectively, in the lungs at 72 h (n = 6 mice per group; *p 0.05). dsRNA increases CXCR2 expression in lungs CXCR2 is the shared cellular receptor for the murine CXC chemokine ligands KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2/3 [18-20] mice were passively immunized with specific neutralizing anti-murine CXCR2 or with control antibody at times -24, 0, 24, and 48 h following dsRNA treatment. results showed that BAL neutrophil counts from animals that received anti-CXCR2 Ab were significantly reduced as compared to control animals that received normal goat serum. the innate or acute inflammatory component is associated with a predominance of infiltrating neutrophils. the host's inflammatory response to viral replication leads to pulmonary pathology hallmarked by leukocyte infiltrate and resultant microvascular leak. as the lung injury persists or recurs with multiple subsequent viral infections, pulmonary vascular and airway remodeling may occur. study focusing specifically on effects of intratracheal dsRNA at a low dose found similar systemic inflammatory effects but specific pulmonary effects only when dsRNA was delivered in conjunction with IFN [48]. a recent study examined the effects of inhibiting the CC chemokine receptor, CCR1, during live-virus exposure in mice and showed that mortality during pneumovirus infection was decreased. mice in vivo have shown a maximum innate immune response starting at 72 h following intratracheal dsRNA exposure. we then focused on the mechanisms responsible for promoting the inflammation and subsequent lung injury. findings consistent with findings from previous studies using a live virus that also resulted in early neutrophil infiltration. anti-CXCR2 Ab-treated mice showed significant reductions specific toneutrophil infiltration that were paralleled by a decrease in lung injury. this suggests that if other leukocytes are recruited there are redundant pathways involved in their recruitment that are CXCR2-independent. our findings are similar to previous neutralization studies in virus-infected mice. dsRNA treatment induced the expression of TLR3 on the cell surface of airways. this suggests a positive feedback system in which epithelial cells exposed to dsRNA increase TLR3 expression on their cell surface. this suggests a positive feedback system in which epithelial cells exposed to dsRNA increase TLR3 expression on their cell surface.
