{"summary": "the worldwide incidence of people who are chronically infected with HCV numbers over 150 million. at least three million people in the united states have a chronic HCV infection, placing them at risk for developing serious liver disease or cancer (3). development of more accessible animal models for hepatitis C is a promising advance (26\u201328) chimpanzees can support HCV infection (24, 25), but development of more accessible animal models for hepatitis C has also been a bottleneck for vaccine development. both E1 and E2 are heavily glycosylated and have multiple disulfide cross-links. a significant proportion of E1 or E2 forms misfolded aggregates with incorrect disulfide cross-links. E2c-Kong consists of the \u201ccore\u201d of the E2 ectodomain of H77 (genotype 1a), spanning aa 412 to 645, with a deletion of the 28 amino acids at the N terminus known as hypervariable region 1 (HVR1). both groups made the same 98-aa truncation of E2c at the C terminus, thus removing the aromatic juxtamembrane domain (called the the length of loops may not correspond to the length in the loops in the HCV E2 ectodomain core structure. red structures represent the central sandwich, a structural motif present in class II viral fusion proteins. the central immunoglobulin (Ig)-like sandwich scaffold is stabilized by two disulfide cross-links. aa 412 to 420 (hypervariable region 1 [HVR1]), aa 454 to 491 (HVR2) and aa 586 to 596 (HVR3) in E2c-Khan and aa 556 to 491 (HVR2) are the same except for the four cysteines near HVR3. some of the glycans are disordered in the E2c-Kong crystal structure. despite the lack of some loops, it is apparent that the structures solved by Kong et al. (33) and Khan et al. (34) represent the essential scaffold of the E2 ectodomain. human MAbs (huMAbs) can directly indicate which viral epitopes are recognized by the human humoral immune system (45). the newly determined E2 ectodomain structure provides a clear demonstration of how glycans shield large portions of the molecule from antibodies. huMAb AR4A recognizes a discontinuous epitope outside the CD81 binding site on the E1-E2 complex (45, 51). huMAb AR4A is exceptional in that it neutralizes HCV from diverse genotypes and protects against heterologous HCV challenge. region comprising aa 474 to 492 is deleted in E2c-Kong. part that is not deleted is adjacent to, but not part of the CD81 binding region. aa 612 to 619 form a central -helix, which may be critical for the overall E2 architecture. todomain structure can guide studies to identify binding sites for HCV's other receptors and coreceptors. it is also important to consider the possibility that HCV structural rearrangements may occur during the entry process following interactions with other receptors and coreceptors. Krey and coworkers modeled HCV E2 as a class II VFP. their structural model was guided by their experimentally determined disulfide cross-link pattern for E2. they concluded that HCV E2 functions as both the receptor binding protein and fusion protein. the sequence from aa 264 to 290 has a high propensity to interact with lipid membranes. peptides corresponding to this putative HCV fusion loop were among the most active peptides derived from a library of overlapping peptides representing E1 and E2 at inducing fusion. other features of E1 are consistent with its role as the HCV VFP. the ectodomain structure of the membrane protein domains of mature dengue virus (DENV) particles was determined to a resolution of 9.5 by cryoelectron microscopy. the stem region of flavivirus E (defined as the domain between the ectodomain and the TM anchor) is comprised of two -helical domains, the first of which is a \u201cleucine zipper\u201d or \u201cheptad repeat\u201d. a synthetic peptide with the sequence of the HCV E1 stem strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes, interacts with negatively charged phospholipids, and locates to a shallow position in the membrane (110). the transmembrane anchor region of the class II E protein of dengue virus is much longer than the 19 to 25 residues of a canonical transmembrane helix (111) sequence-specific heteromeric interactions along the lengths of the helices are critical for assembly of the fusion protein complex of HCV. these residues (Fig. 2B, blue asterisks) likely mediate lateral interactions between the helices (113). the mechanism of virion-cell membrane fusion mediated by class II VFPs encoded by members of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae follows a pathway that involves large-scale domain rearrangement of E. the new structural determinations suggest that the HCV glycoproteins do not behave like class II fusion proteins and most likely use a different mechanism. the structure of the E2 ectodomain core can inform vaccine design principles even in the absence of a high-resolution E1 structure. the stable E2 construct could be helpful in solving the structure of the HCV E1-E2 heterodimer."}
