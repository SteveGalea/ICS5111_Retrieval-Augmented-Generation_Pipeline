{"summary": "a pilot survey of 30 students was conducted to validate a questionnaire and determine the sample size for the study. results showed 30% of participants may have had some anxiety of acquiring SARS during the outbreak. in a population of 13,000 students, a sample of 310 was calculated to obtain a measurable anxiety level. 300 participants, 219 (73%) were women, and 213 (71%) were majoring in nonhealth-related areas. average age was 21.1 years (SD = 4.7), with 93% between 18 and 23 years of age. daily use of television, radio, and Internet was categorized as previously reported (4). the average SARS-specific knowledge score was not statistically associated with access to and use of any type of media. a passing score was more common for those who used the Internet to obtain SARS-related information (t[df = 149] = 1.7, p = 0.088). the only predictors of high anxiety levels were sex (women) and area of residence in the greater Toronto area. despite believing media coverage had been overdone, they reported low anxiety of acquiring SARS."}
