{"summary": "analysis of change in routine blood parameters is used for the evaluation of training progress, as well as general health. additional parameters, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), have been considered. the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the changes in SAA concentration in Arabian endurance horses during their first training season. analysis of change in these parameters over time provides information on metabolic alterations associated with training progress. however, it does not allow to detect developing disorders at the subclinical stage [3]. a similar reaction has been described in humans [10,11] and animals [12,13] after strenuous endurance events. the horses were introduced to endurance competitions at limited distance. the animals were monitored for the whole training season and examined before and after training sessions selected for the study. the study covered seven months and included five training sessions and three competitions. SAA concentrations were measured using immunoenzymatic commercial assay. sample dilution was 1:1000 instead of 1:2000, recommended by manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the results were appropriately recalculated. paired-sample Student\u2019s t-test, or the Wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test, were used in pairwise comparisons. a significance level (0.05) was set at 0.05. horses were housed in two stables in similar conditions, fed, and trained according to similar protocols. all blood samples were acquired by a jugular venipuncture using a BD Vacutainer system into K2-EDTA tubes for hematological tests. EDTA blood samples were kept at + 4 \u00b0C and examined within 5 h for hematological parameters. serum free from any apparent hemolysis was aspirated for further analyses. arithmetic mean standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) were presented as the arithmetic mean standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), unless normally distributed. results In all horses hematological and serum biochemical parameters determined before the physical effort fell within relevant reference intervals. results of the univariate hierarchical linear model investigating the link between four independent variables (number of efforts in the season, type of effort, time of blood collection, and the interaction between type of effort and time of blood collection) the level of hematological and serum biochemical parameters, adjusted by the individual effect of the horse. c 0.169 - c 0.169 - c 0.249 - c 0.717 0.045 a entered into the model after logarithmic transformation. b if interaction was non-significant and p-values without interaction were used. c reported only if significant ( = 0.05) p-value 0.484 b 0.025 b a paired Student\u2019s t-test; b Wilcoxon signed rank; c sign test; Abbreviations: SD, standard deviation; IQR, interquartile range. before and after training sessions in eight horses (green lines) and before and after competitions in seven horses (red lines) study presenting changes in blood parameters of endurance horses. CPK and AST activities are commonly used in horses as the indicators of any kind of muscle fatigue or damage. the differences between resting and post-exercise measurements were similar during training and competition. the latter is likely to account for the post-exercise increase of TSP. a high load of training produces muscle and/or joint injuries. exercise-induced APR in horses has been postulated to result from an acute challenge to muscle metabolism, rather than muscle damage. in our study, an increase of SAA concentration (up to 16-fold) was observed after competitions but not during training. even the highest individual SAA concentrations after competition were still relatively low (max. 10.62 mg/L), compared with those reported in horses with acute inflammation in the course of viral infections. in young, inexperienced endurance horses, SAA concentrations at rest are higher [15], which is consistent with the findings of our present study. these facts suggest that such phenomena do not occur in the first training season, so it probably requires a longer training process."}
