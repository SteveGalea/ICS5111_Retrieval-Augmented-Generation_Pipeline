{"summary": "the current guidelines for serologic testing were adopted in 1994. the guidelines are geared to assess exposure to B. burgdorferi through the patient\u2019s antibody response to infection rather than direct detection of nucleic acid or protein from the microbe. direct tests detect exposure to a pathogen indirectly via quantification of a specific antibody in blood. direct tests are designed to detect the etiologic agent itself, or components of it. a direct test could provide a definitive indication of active B. burgdorferi infection. past attempts to develop an antigen-capture assay had poor specificity, low sensitivity, and uncertainty about the choice of the capture antigen target. the specificity and sensitivity of an antigen-detection assay is largely a function of the choice of the capture and reporter antigenic targets, as well as the affinity of the antibody used to capture or detect it [12] concentration methods can be categorized as follows: removal of solute or water [16], electrophoretic or chromatographic separation [17], and affinity capture [18\u201320]. new developments to stabilize proteins in samples prior to analysis may be suitable for several assays [14]. Detection of DNA: nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) a NAAT is a measure of the presence of the microbe and therefore active infection. PCR strategies have performed well in blood tests for causative agents of sepsis [30] and Ebola [29]. sensitivity of PCR-based assays was increased by 16000-fold. sensitivity with 100% specificity was the use of multiple primers. there appear to be skin-restricted genotypes, which may be the reason for negative results in blood. some acute Lyme disease studies have documented that the number of organisms in the blood may have been higher than appreciated. antigen tests can be used to diagnose legionellosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and dimorphic fungal infections. a direct test for Lyme disease is needed, but a sensitive and specific antigen-capture assay has been elusive. previous attempts to develop an antigen-capture assay had poor specificity and low sensitivity. emerging antigen concentration and enrichment methods [14, 15] have the potential to address another likely limitation\u2014B. burgdorferi-specific antigens are probably in very low abundance in body fluids. new developments to stabilize proteins in samples prior to analysis may be suitable for several assays [14] PCR and high-throughput sequencing have matured and are now routinely used to detect many new pathogens. for an improved Lyme disease assay, performance should be equal to or better than the existing serologic 2-tier enzyme immunoassay followed by Western blot. a NAAT is a measure of the presence of the microbe and therefore active infection. in vitro experiments, the number of cases detected was 7-fold greater than without this step. the third step that increased sensitivity with 100% specificity was the use of multiple primers. there appear to be skin-restricted genotypes, which may be the reason for negative results in blood. low sequencing error rates (eg, Illumina Novae or MiSeq platforms) have allowed resolution of repeated sequences that are the hallmark of Borrelia genomes. targeted deep sequencing (eg, enrichment for desired genomic regions prior to sequencing via either hybridization or PCR amplification techniques) could potentially be used as a direct-detection method in clinical diagnostics. some molecular techniques may be too expensive for routine clinical use, at least currently. other limitations of genomic testing, particularly on a large scale, require attention to the risk of exogenous contamination. complexity of the technique, which can make the testing of hundreds of samples in 1 day more difficult; and cost-benefit factors. direct nucleic acid and protein detections would complement improving indirect serological tests for more comprehensive diagnosis of Lyme disease. sensitivity and specificity soon after a tick bite and/or infection at or before the time of symptom onset High sensitivity and specificity in later stage of disease."}
