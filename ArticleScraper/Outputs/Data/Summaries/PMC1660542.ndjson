{"summary": "the pathogenicity of S. epidermidis has been attributed to its capacity to form biofilms on surfaces of medical devices. it has an urgent need to design novel antibiotics against staphylococci infections, especially those can kill cells embedded in biofilm. coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis have become frequent causes of infections in connection with surgically implanted medical devices. the appearance of multi-resistant and vancomycin-resistant strains has increased quickly due to the increasing use of antibiotics in hospitals. there is therefore an urgent need to design novel antibiotics against staphylococcus infections. aranorosinol B, obtained by screening acetone extracts from 4000 microbes, has been documented to be effective antibacterial agents against B. subtilis. aranorosinol B may not be an optimal model organism to investigate biofilm formation, a process of major importance for the virulence of staphylococci. a 3D model of the conserved HATPase_c domain of S. epidermidis YycG HK was constructed. of the 76 candidates selected from the database by SBVS, seven compounds were active in inhibiting growth of S. epidermidis on plates or in liquid media. yycG/yycF genes identified in S. epidermidis failed with homologous recombination technology. domain analysis indicates that the YycG protein of S. epidermidis contains one transmembrane segment. several domains identified in other proteins: HAMP (a domain present in Histidine kinases, Adenylyl cyclases, Methyl-accepting proteins and Phosphatases), PAS (a coli osmosensor EnvZ was used as a template for modeling the 3D structure of the YycG HATPase_c domain of S. epidermidis. the analysis was performed based on the SMART database. the resulting model 3D structure superposed well with the NMR structure of the homologous domain of EnvZ. the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the C atoms is about 1.708. the HATPase_c domain of YycG is thus predicted to fold in similar way to that in EnvZ. the YycG HATPase_c domain of S. epidermidis folds into a two-layer sandwich structure. four high conserved motifs, N-box (Asn499Tyr507), G1-box (Ile53Ile538), F-box (Asp544Phe547), G2-box (Gly563Gly567), around the catalytic domain. s Phe46, Thr483, Ile484, Phe485, Met493, and Leu598, exhibit hydrophobic character. area II locates near entrance of binding pocket and show hydrophilic character. 85,000 potential drug-like molecules were selected from the SPECS database. seven out of 76 candidates completely inhibited growth of S. epidermidis. the seven inhibitors belong to four different classes of chemical structures. these compounds include three derivatives of thiazolidinone (compounds 2, 5, and 7), two derivatives of benzamide (compounds 1 and 3), one derivative of furan (compound 4) and one derivative of pyrimidinone (compound 6). compound 1 and 3 inhibited the growth of S. aureus and S. pyogenes. none of these compounds were active against Gram-negative bacteria. this is consistent with the absence of a YycG/YycF TCS counterpart in these genomes. 25 6.25 6.25 1.56 6.25 25 25 Compound 6 100 100 >200 undone undone undone undone Compound 7 0.2 >200 >200 >200 >400 >400 a Stock solution of the compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at the concentration of 200 M. the molecule weights of these seven compounds are: compound 1 (652), compound 2 (519), compound 3 (532), compound 4 (440), compound 5 (623), compound 6 (555) and compound the effects of various compounds (dissolved in DMSO) on biofilm-covered cells of S. epidermidis RP62A strain were investigated. this assay was repeated three times and the values represented the mean and SD from three experiments. the binding affinities of seven putative YycG inhibitors to the YycG' protein were determined by using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) in vitro. six compounds (1\u20135 and 7) displayed high binding affinities to the YycG' protein. compound 6 only bound very poorly to the YycG' protein. c IC50 represents the concentration of inhibition of 50% the YycG' protein autophosphorylation. d CC50 represents the concentration that produce a 50% cytotoxicity effect on Vero cell. d CC50 represents the concentration that produce a 50% cytotoxicity effect on Vero cell. kinase activity of YycG' protein was measured by using the Kinase-GloTM Luminescent Kinase assay. a direct relationship existed between the luminescence measured with the Kinase-GloTM Reagent and the amount of ATP. compound 6, which binds poorly to the YycG' protein, showed almost no activity against YycG' ATPase activity (approximately 7% inhibition at 50 M) the concentrations needed to decrease YycG' ATPase activity to 50% (IC50 values) by the 6 active compounds were calculated by gradual dilution of these compounds with an invariable concentration of protein (4 g) and ATP (3 M) most CC50 values were higher than the highest inhibitor concentration used (200 M), except in the case of two inhibitors (compounds 2 and 3) which had CC50 values below 200 M (CC50 is the concentration that induces a 50% cytotoxicity effect on Vero cells) at the concentration of their respective MIC values, all these compounds displayed very low ( 10%) or almost no cytotoxicity (data not shown) the MICs of Tet and Cip are both 0.25 g/ml. each assay was performed in quadruplicate and repeated twice. cells with no compounds treatment were for the zero and 100% hemolysis controls. the middle part of each inhibitor has two hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bonding to Asn503 and Lys542, which stabilize each one of the six inhibitor candidates in the binding pocket. the hydrophobic moieties of the inhibitors fit well into the two hydrophobic cavities. this is well in agreement with previous biological function studies which demonstrated that the conserved Asn503 in the N box was necessary for ligand binding in both classes I and II TCS. four-point pharmacophores models of inhibitors compose of two hydrogen bond acceptors. they interact with asn503 and Lys542 and two hydrophobic centers. the sequence of the YycG protein in S. epidermidis is highly homologous to those of S. aureus and B. subtilis. domain analysis indicates that the YycG protein of S. epidermidis contains one transmembrane segment. several domains identified in other proteins: HAMP (a domain present in Histidine kinases, Adenylyl cyclases, Methyl-accepting proteins and Phosphatases), PAS (a domain initially found to be common to Period circadian protein, Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein, and Single-minded protein) the analysis was performed based on the SMART database. the columns represent the transmembrane segment predicted by the TMHMM2 program. the height of columns below the alignment represents the similarity between two proteins. the resulting model 3D structure superposed well with the NMR structure of the homologous domain of EnvZ. the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the C atoms is about 1.708. the HATPase_c domain of YycG is thus predicted to fold in a similar way to that in EnvZ. n499Tyr507), G1-box (Ile53Ile538), F-box (Asp544Phe547), G2-box (Gly563Gly567) around the catalytic domain of the HPK encompasses the active ATP-binding pocket. a long loop from Asp548 to Ala574 drifts outside the pocket. Schematic diagrams were made by the program Molscript. 85,000 potential drug-like molecules were selected from the SPECS database. the most optimal 10,000 structures were re-scored using the drug-selection filter. 76 compound samples could be purchased from the SPECS Company. 76 candidates completely inhibited growth of S. epidermidis. the seven inhibitors belong to four different classes of chemical structures. these compounds include three derivatives of thiazolidinone (compounds 2, 5, and 7), two derivatives of benzamide (compounds 1 and 3), one derivative of furan (compound 4) and one derivative of pyrimidinone (compound 6). these compounds were active against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the concentration of 200 M. this is consistent with the absence of a YycG/YycF TCS counterpart in these genomes. compound 1 (652), compound 2 (519), compound 3 (532), compound 4 (440), compound 5 (623), compound 6 (555) and compound 7 (505) methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exhibited better killing effects than vancomycin on cells embedded in mature biofilms of S. epidermidis clinical isolates. mature biofilm of S. epidermidis RP62A strain formed in 12-wells polystyrene plates. effects of various compounds (dissolved in DMSO) on biofilm-covered cells. the binding affinities of seven putative YycG inhibitors to the YycG' protein were determined by using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) in vitro. six compounds (1\u20135 and 7) displayed high binding affinities to the YycG' protein. compound 6 only bound very poorly to the YycG' protein. c IC50 represents the concentration of inhibition of 50% the YycG' protein autophosphorylation. d CC50 represents the concentration that produce a 50% cytotoxicity effect on vero cell. d CC50 represents the concentration that produce a 50% cytotoxicity effect on Vero cell. kinase activity of YycG' protein was measured by using the Kinase-GloTM Luminescent Kinase assay. the luminescence was decreased in all groups containing different ATP concentrations. the results indicated that the purified YycG' protein possesses the ATPase activity in vitro. the concentrations needed to decrease YycG' ATPase activity by the 6 active compounds (1\u20135 and 7) were calculated by gradual dilution of these compounds with an invariable concentration of protein (4 g) and ATP (3 M) at the concentration of 50 M, only compound 5 displays much lower inhibitory effect (20%) on SrrB' than it does (73%) on YycG'. at their MIC concentrations, compounds 1\u20137 displayed no apparent hemolysis (5% of the zero control) this compares well with the effect of conventional antibiotics such as tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. at their 4 times MIC concentrations, only compound 2 showed a little hemolysis (6% of the zero control), and at the highest concentration (200 M), the hemolytic activity of compound 2 increased to 16% of the zero control. treatment and with 1% Triton-100 treatment were for the zero and 100% hemolysis controls, respectively. black and white columns represented the concentrations of 4MICs and MICs of 7 inhibitors and two conventional antibiotics. the binding model revealed that asn503 is of prime importance for stabilizing the interactions between the inhibitors and the YycG protein. this is well in agreement with previous biological function studies which demonstrated that the conserved Asn503 in the N box was necessary for ligand binding in both classes I and II TCS [35,36]. besides those interactions, the hydrophobic area may bind hydrophobic parts of different compounds and stabilize these in the inner hollow of the pocket. YycG/YycF TCS is conserved and specific for low G+C Gram-positive bacteria such as B. subtilis, S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes [11,12,37,38] this TCS is regulated by several genes involved in cell-wall biosynthesis and metabolism, such as teichoic acid biosynthesis protein F [40], and cell wall synthesis protein YpfP [41] a total of 16 putative TCSs have been found in the genome of S. epidermidis, including YycG/YycF. a total of 6 compounds were promising candidates as potential YycG HK inhibitors. yycG inhibitor compounds were found to have somewhat reduced bactericidal effect on mature biofilms of S. epidermidis. these compounds were, however, much more efficient against sessile bacteria than the commonly used staphylococcus antibiotic, vancomycin. this was accounted for in S. aureus by reduced penetration of vancomycin and delay of the exposure of the bacteria in the biofilm deeper layers. the structure-based virtual screening technology can be widely used for detection of potential bacterial TCSs inhibitors in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. the abbreviations used are TCS, two-component system; HK, histidine kinase; SBVS, structure-based virtual screening; HTS, high throughput screening; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. 0.25% glucose, E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB, Oxoid) all compounds used as inhibitor candidates were purchased from the SPECS Company in the Netherlands. stock solutions of the compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) Prostat module of InsightII was used to analyze properties of bonds, angles, and torsions. ATP-binding pocket was probed on optimized 3D model of YycG HATPase_c domain. SPECS database contains structural information of 280,000 small molecules. the ligand-receptor binding energy was approximated by van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies. a grid-based minimization was carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the receptor binding site. the 10,000 compounds with the highest score as obtained by DOCK search were selected for a second round docking using the single anchor search and torsion minimization method. bacterial suspension was inoculated into the wells of sterile 12-well polystyrene microtiter plates. the plates were washed gently four times with sterile PBS. then the biofilm cells were scraped from the plate and resuspended in 1 ml PBS. then the cells were violently vortexed to disintegrate clumps of cells. the expressed YycG' protein was purified with the ProBondTM Purification System (Invitrogen, California, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. in vitro binding affinities of the inhibitor compounds to the YycG' protein were determined using surface plasmon resonance. 4 g YycG' protein was pre-incubated with a series of dilution of compounds in the reaction buffer (40 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA), at 25\u00b0C for 30 min. 3 M ATP was added for another incubation of 30 min at 25\u00b0C, and Kinase-GloTM Reagent was added to detect the rest amount of erythrocytes were washed three times in sterile saline and resuspended to 5% prior to the assay. a volume of 200 l cell suspension containing MIC or 4MIC concentrations of the compounds was added in quadruplicate to the wells of 96-well microtiter plates. cell suspensions were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min.
