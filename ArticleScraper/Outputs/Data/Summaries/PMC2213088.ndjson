{"summary": "RESULTS 8 of the 18 suspected SARS victims were confirmed as having SARS by demonstration of the pathogen. all cases had similar pathologic changes in their lungs, immune system, and other organs. differences in lymphocyte counts between confirmed and misdiagnosed cases also were demonstrated. multinuclear giant syncytial cells found in the alveoli contained a large amount of SARS viral sequences. many pulmonary epithelial cells (small arrows) contained the virus. bar, 100 m. (F) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the lung. the region indicated by the arrow is enlarged in I. Bar, 2 m. (I) Enlargement of the region in H. most of the ciliated epithelial cells (arrows) of the trachea were infected by the virus. atin immunolabeling revealed that pulmonary epithelial cells were infected by the virus. more than 50% of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea showed positive cytoplasmic hybridization. EM detected SARS-like viral particles in monocytes and lymphocytes of six patients. EM further confirmed the nature of these cells. the macrophages appeared to be activated as they became slightly larger. the nature of these cells was confirmed with immunohistochemistry of CD68. EM image of the cytoplasm of a lymphocyte shows three coronavirus-like particles (arrows) in the cytoplasm. the one on the lower left seems to have just trespassed the membrane and entered the lymphocyte. bar, 0.1 m. similar SARS coronavirus-like particles were not detected in the lymphocytes of non-SARS patient. in situ hybridization detected SARS genomic sequence positive lymphocytes (arrows) in a lymph node from the hilus of the lung of a SARS autopsy. bar, 70 m. Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the lymphocytes in the spleen from a SARS autopsy. in situ hybridization identified the SARS viral sequence in the enlarged macrophages and in the isolated and sometimes clustered T lymphocytes. the lymphoid component of the intestine showed widespread degenerative changes. the lymphoid component of the intestine showed widespread degenerative changes. in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of SARS positivity in the lymphocytes of the mucosa and the submucosa. positive signal was not found in the negative control, in which no specific probe was used, or in non-SARS cases. bar, 100 m. (H) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of mucosal epithelial cells in the small intestine of a patient who had SARS. bar, 70 m. (L) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the distal tubules of the kidney of a patient who had SARS. negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of neurons in the brain of a patient who had SARS. no positive signal was detected. bar, 100 m. Digestive tract In all of the confirmed SARS cases, the digestive tract displayed mild inflammatory changes. edema and scattered red degeneration of the neurons were present in the brains of six of the eight confirmed cases of SARS. other organs In five out of the eight confirmed cases, hepatocytes in the centrilobular zone showed apparent degenerative changes. the lymphocytes were decreased from the onset of the disease in patients who had SARS but not in patients who did not have SARS. the differences in the two groups with regard to the extent of lymphocyte reduction remained the same. the results from the retrospective investigation suggest that lymphopenia is a characteristic feature of SARS. demonstrated SARS virus infection were unique to patients who had SARS. all controls used in SARS assays were negative. additional controls excluded interference between in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. multinuclear giant syncytial cells found in the alveoli contained a large amount of SARS viral sequences (large arrows) bar, 80 m. (D) in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the lung from a SARS victim who died 62 d after the onset of high fever. bar, 50 m. Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the trachea from a patient who had SARS. in situ hybridization demonstrated SARS viral sequences in the cytoplasm of intact and degenerating epithelial cells of the lungs. more than 50% of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea showed positive cytoplasmic hybridization. no positive signal was detected in the negative control.

Table II. Percent of white blood cells containing coronavirus-like particles in SARS patients. similar SARS coronavirus-like particles were not detected in the lymphocytes of non-SARS patient. bar, 20 m. (F) Negative control for immunohistochemistry staining of the spleen from a patient who had confirmed SARS in which PBS was substituted for the anti-CD68 antibody. in situ hybridization detected SARS genomic sequence positive lymphocytes in the spleen from a SARS autopsy. bar, 70 m. (L) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence. no positive signal was detected. in situ hybridization identified the SARS viral sequence in the enlarged macrophages and in the isolated and sometimes clustered T lymphocytes. EM detected viral particles in the submucosa of the gut and within the residual lymphocytes. negative signal was not found in the negative control, in which no specific probe was used, or in non-SARS cases. bar, 30 m. (E) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of lymphocytes in the submucosal lymphoid tissue of a patient who did not have SARS. bar, 100 m. (J) In situ hybridization detected SARS genomic sequence in the tubular epithelium (arrows) of the distal tubules of the kidney of a patient who had SARS. bar, 70 m. (L) Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the distal tubules of the kidney of a patient who had SARS. bar, 100 m. (Q) hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of neurons in the brain of a patient who did not have SARS. no positive signal was detected. the digestive tract displayed mild inflammatory changes. hepatocytes in the centrilobular zone showed apparent degenerative changes. no obvious pathologic change was observed in the heart, the pancreas, the adrenal gland, the thyroid gland, or the skeletal muscle. the results from the retrospective investigation suggest that lymphopenia is a characteristic feature of SARS, and implicates an early and consistent destruction of lymphocytes. the results from the retrospective investigation suggest that lymphopenia is a characteristic feature of SARS. the presence and localization of the virus in these target cells were confirmed by in situ hybridization, EM, and real-time PCR. it is evident that infection by the virus is not confined to the lungs, but involves other parts of the respiratory tract and other organ systems, most importantly immune cells. spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissues of the gut were reduced markedly. this destruction of lymphocytes would cause an acute immunodeficiency. the markedly weakened immune system at the early and mid stages of the disease is likely to be the reason for the acute nature and severity of the respiratory syndrome. mucosal lymphocytes most likely are the source for the virus in the stool. it suggests that the virus is not ingested but more likely is presented to the gut by way of infected circulating immune cells. hematuria may occur in patients who have SARS (15, 16) the extent of immune cell damage, reflected by lymphocyte count, is a manifestation of the patient's immune status and predictor of outcome. the damage to the immune system, more than damage to the lungs, determines whether a patient recovers or dies from the infection. pathogenesis of SARS Based on our findings, we propose the following pathogenesis mechanism of SARS. the virus enters the body through the respiratory tract and first infects the epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. the virus infects and damages the immune cells of the spleen, peripheral and central lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. autopsies were performed on 18 patients suspected to have died of SARS infections. 15 died between June and August 2003 (7 confirmed as SARS) and 3 died in April 2004 (one confirmed as SARS) 18 suspected SARS cases Case no.

GCAAGTGAGATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAAGTGCATTTACATTGGCTA-3\u2032 as the innermost pair. 5\u2032-ACACTTGCTGTAACTTATCAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCATAGAGCCTGTGTGTGAGG-3\u2032 as the outermost pair. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed separately on consecutive sections. additional controls were performed for the double staining, including in situ hybridization and immunostaining alone, to ensure that one reaction did not interfere, diminish, or enhance the reaction of the other. the pathology of the autopsy cases represents the mid and the late stages of the disease."}
