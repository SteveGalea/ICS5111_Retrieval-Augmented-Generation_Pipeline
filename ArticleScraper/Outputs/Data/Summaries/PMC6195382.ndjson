{"summary": "antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein. it is a member of the Ig superfamily with a basic structure of sequentially ordered Ig-like domains. this protein serves as an adhesion molecule via homophilic and heterophilic interactions. expression of CEACAM1 on melanoma cells inversely correlated with survival of breast cancer patients [8]. expression of CEACAM1 on primary tumor lymph nodes and metastases linked to metastatic disease and poor prognosis. mouse anti-CEACAM1 Ab CC1 prevented tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-L1 or anti-TIM-3 mAbs [21]. these data have led to a proposal that CEACAM1 plays a role as an immune checkpoint, similar to PD1 blocking productive anti-tumor responses in vivo. surface CEACAM-1 in tumor infiltrates was comprehensively assessed using flow cytometry. about 100 mm3 of subcutaneous tumors were established 7\u201310 days post implant. the expression was first measured from untreated tumors by flow cytometry. the frequency of CEACAM1-expressing CD8 T cells was measured at 4 days after the second dose (8 days after the initial dose) of either isotype control or anti-PD-1 injection. compiled frequencies of CEACAM1-expressing CD8 T cells are plotted in (C) the average proportion of CEACAM1+ cells remained less than 10% of total CD8 T cells. the frequency of CEACAM1+ CD4 T cells appeared more variable in different tumors. for example, CT26 tumor has relatively higher frequency of CEACAM1+ CD4 T cells compared to MBT2 or MC38. however, the frequency of CEACAM1+ populations in Treg and in all myeloid cells did not change before and after muDX400 in vivo treatment CEACAM1 ligand interactions were studied using protein- and cell-ELISAs. mCEACAM1 interaction with mTIM-3 was evaluated using mTIM3-CHO cells (C) and anti-TIM-3 mAb mAb was used as a positive control. the Fab of CC1 blocked the CC1 homophilic interaction in cELISA and in protein ELISA. the potential effect of CC1 on this interaction was not studied. the PK properties of CC1 were studied in balb/c mice. dose, PK was linear because the CMax and AUC0-Inf were dose proportional between 30 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg. simulated multi-dose (every 2 days) PK profile for the 30 mg/kg dose shows that the trough level of CC1 is approximately 313 nM, which is expected to sufficiently block CC1 binding in vivo. CC1 treatment has fully engaged CEACAM-1 on tumor infiltrates at a dose level of 10 plasma from each mouse at hours 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 following dosing was obtained by micro-sampling. plasma from each mouse at hours 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 following dosing was obtained by micro-sampling. CC1 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) administered every other day did not significantly attenuate tumor growth relative to controls. however, muDX400 treatment (5 mg/kg, i.p. given every 4 days) inhibited tumor volume on day 11 by approximately 40\u201350%. CC1 (30 mg/kg) alone did not alter tumor growth rates compared to controls. muDX400 (5 mg/kg) and muDX400 plus CC1 (30 mg/kg) significantly slowed tumor growth. there was no effect of treatment on CD8+ T cells/Treg ratio. CC1 did not significantly increase ICOS expression as a monotherapy or when combined with muDX400. no consistent changes in the proportions of CD4+, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (myeloid or granulocytic) upon treatment were observed. 100 mm3 of subcutaneous tumors were established 7\u201310 days post implant. the CEACAM1 expression was first measured from untreated tumors by flow cytometry. in all cases, high level of CEACAM1 expression was observed on granulocytic (CD11b+ Ly6G+ Ly6Clow) and monocytic (CD11b+ Ly6G+) myeloid cells from all tumors tested. T cells (TCR+CD3+CD4 or CD8+), Treg (FOXP3+HELIOS+ in the CD4+ T cell gate), G-MDSC (CD11b+ I/A-I/ElowLy6G+Ly6Clow), cDC (I/A-I/EhighCD11blow/-CD45R+), monocytes (CD11b+ I/A-I/EhighLy6C+F4/80 the frequency of CEACAM1+ CD4 T cells appeared more variable in different tumors. for example, CT26 tumor has relatively higher frequency of CEACAM1+ CD4 T cells compared to MBT2 or MC38. however, the frequency of CEACAM1+ populations in Treg and in all myeloid cells did not change before and after muDX400 in vivo treatment. mCEACAM1-hFc interaction with mTIM-3 was evaluated using mTIM3-CHO cells (C) and anti-TIM-3 mAb was used as a positive control. no blockade of mCEACAM1-CEACAM1 interaction by CC1 was observed in either protein or cell-based ELISA. CC1 exhibited fast clearance (CL/F 111 34 mL/h/kg) at 10 mg/kg. concentration dropped from 40 ug/mL at 6 h to below 1 ug/mL 48 hr post dosing. this is an uncommon PK feature for an IgG1 mAb. the simulated multi-dose (every 2 days) PK profile for the 30 mg/kg dose shows that the trough level of CC1 is approximately 313 nM, which is expected to sufficiently block CC1 binding in vivo. full receptor occupancy of CEACAM-1 at a cellular level after in vivo CC1 treatments (30 mg/kg) was demonstrated by flow cytometry staining on CT26 tumor infiltrates using a fluorescence-labele female BALB/c mice (8 weeks old, 4 mice/group) were dosed IP with CC1 at 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg. plasma from each mouse at hours 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 following dosing was obtained by micro-sampling. plasma from each mouse at hours 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 following dosing was obtained by micro-sampling.

CC1 (30 mg/kg) alone did not alter tumor growth rates compared to controls. muDX400 (5 mg/kg) and muDX400 plus CC1 (30 mg/kg) significantly slowed tumor growth. tumor infiltrates were isolated from the CT26 model. no consistent changes in the proportions of CD4+, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (myeloid or granulocytic) upon CC1 treatment were observed. quantitative and qualitative analyses of tumor-infiltrating T cells after anti-CEACAM monotherapy or its combination with anti-PD-1 treatment. we found that CEACAM1 was expressed at relatively high levels on freshly harvested tumor infiltrating B, NK cells, and MDSCs. however, the proportion of these cells was low. in mice, a significant fraction of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells have also been reported to express CEACAM1. CC1 mAb is able to bind to two CEACAM1 molecules simultaneously. this suggests that CC1 enhances, rather than blocks, CEACAM1-CEACAM1 interactions. additional studies are needed to fully evaluate the functional significance of such a binding profile. potential interference by galectin-9 in cell-based assays cannot be ruled out. no prior studies have suggested modulation of CEACAM1-Tim-3 interactions by the CC1 Ab. Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells revealed no changes in the proportions of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, Treg cells, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (myeloid or granulocytic) upon CC1 treatment. low or minimal expression of CEACAM1 on tumor infiltrating T cells suggests primary function of CEACAM1 in vivo is mediated via cells other than CD8+ T cells. potential role of CEACAM1 in immuno-oncology remains to be established. protein ELISA is performed very similar to cELISA. microtiter plates were coated with 50 l of mCEACAM-His (Sino Biologics) 1 g/ml in PBS at 4\u00b0 C over-night. plates were washed three times with wash buffer and blocked with 200 l Supeblock. mCEACAM1-hFc was used at 10 g/ml. all other steps were performed the same way as for the ELISA assay. animal groups were used once only and were euthanized. the plate was incubated with 0.5 g/mL of sulfoTAG AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour at room temperature. the plate was washed three times and 150 L of 1 Reading Buffer T was added to each well.
