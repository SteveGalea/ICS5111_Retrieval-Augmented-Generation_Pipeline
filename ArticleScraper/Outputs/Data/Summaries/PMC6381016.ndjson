{"summary": "obesity is an inflammatory condition associated with activation of the immune system and consequent local and systemic inflammation which are negatively associated with a functional immune system. this global obesity epidemic affects all age groups. adipose tissue is a major immunological tissue that contributes to systemic inflammation. inflammation is characterized by infiltration and activation of immune cells secreting pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines. physiological changes include inflammation of the AT, which leads to overt chronic disease, frailty and mortality. chronic inflammation leads to transition from metabolically normal obesity to metabolic syndrome. excess nutrients, due to inefficient glucose metabolism, promote chronic low-grade inflammation. obesity linked to higher severity of RTI in individuals of different ages similar to what has been shown in older adults. changes in the lung may be due to higher weight load on the thorax. changes in the immune system lead to chronic inflammation, immune activation, and reduced clearance of pathogens. gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia and asthma. mechanisms of defense against pathogens and smaller particles are decreased in obese individuals leading to low-grade chronic inflammation. plasma levels of leptin positively correlate with body fat and BMI, increase with age (39), and contribute to the inflammatory status of the AT associated with obesity. the importance of RSV is increasingly recognized in hospitalized adults. a study conducted in middle-aged and older adults has shown that RSV infection was associated with obesity (60) pneumococcus pneumoniae is a common pathogen in the nasopharynx. the risk of infection is higher in obese vs. lean individuals. the risk of infection is higher in obese versus lean individuals. a recent study of survivors of community-acquired pneumonia showed that this obesity paradox could not be attributed to differences in biomarkers of several inflammatory pathways. the risk of infection is significantly higher in individuals 65 years and older as compared to younger individuals (66). by the end of the twentieth century, mortality rates had dropped to 20% in individuals 65 years and older as compared to younger individuals (66). 66) 65 AIDSc 69%e (69) SLEd

activation, and decreased immune responses. the upper RT (URT) microbiota changes with age contributing to Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization and its inefficient clearance, as shown by studies conducted in mice. the risk of pneumococcal infection is also higher in individuals of certain ethnic groups. in the population 60, Native Alaskans as well as Native Americans of the Apache tribe living in Arizona had a 2-fold increase risk of pneumococcal disease. the importance of RSV is increasingly recognized in hospitalized adults, but mainly in those 65 years and older. most of the studies published on RSV-associated hospitalizations have been conducted in individuals 65 years, with 5\u201310% of hospitalizations. the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in obese elderly individuals is directly associated with higher BMI in both age groups (62). however, other studies have conversely shown that obese compared to lean individuals are 2-fold more likely to survive after being admitted to hospital with pneumococcus infection. the risk of infection is significantly higher in individuals 65 years and older as compared to younger individuals (66). by the end of the twentieth century, mortality rates had dropped to 20% in individuals 65 years of age and to 40% in those 85 years of age (67\u201369). none reporteda 27% (71) 86\u2013104 years None reporteda 20% (72) mortality rates due to different comorbidities are not reported. b T2DM, type-2 diabetes mellitus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. d SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus. the upper RT (URT) (82) microbiota changes with age contributing to Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization and its inefficient clearance. it is continuously exposed to bacteria present in the environment, which survive in the nasal and oral cavities of older individuals. obesity is associated with changes in gut microbiota at phylum-level and with reduced bacterial diversity in mice and humans. in the population 60, Native Alaskans as well as Native Americans of the Apache tribe living in Arizona had a 2-fold increase risk of pneumococcal disease compared to non-native populations living in the same area. in northern Canada, higher risk of pneumococcal disease has been reported for Indigenous populations (92). conflict of interest Statement JM has received honoraria from Sanofi, GSK and Pfizer for participation in
