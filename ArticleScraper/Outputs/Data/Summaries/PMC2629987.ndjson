{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects between 12 and 24 million people in the united states. it is the fourth leading cause of death, accounting for over 106,000 deaths in 1996. COPD is the only condition in the top 10 causes of death with an increasing prevalence and mortality. in 1996, acute exacerbations of COPD resulted in sixth highest use of hospital bed days/yr in the us (176 million) and sixth highest number of days lost from work (57.5 million) a review of eighteen studies confirmed that AECOPD worsened health-related quality of life (HRQL) preventing AECOPDs, or reducing their severity, should have favorable clinical, physiological and economical effects in COPD patients. many have advocated a central pathogenic role of this inflammatory response. total sputum cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, IL-8, neutrophil elastase, eosinophilic cationic protein (RANTES) increased compared to the stable state. new pathways promulgating this inflammatory response have recently been defined. macrophages secret cytokines and chemokines when stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) many of the lung lymphocytes are type 1 cytokine-producing CD8 T cells. the exact mechanism remains unproven. a large proportion of AECOPDs are felt to reflect infection, whether bacterial or viral. most frequently reported agents include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus. etiologic role of bacteria in individual AECOPD episodes has been subject of much controversy. bacterial colonization, as defined by sputum cultures, is associated with a greater sputum and systemic inflammatory response, more frequent clinical AECOPD episodes and greater symptoms and worse health status. novel methodological approaches have provided even more compelling data implicating bacterial pathogens in AECOPD. a similar approach has confirmed the same increased risk of AECOPD for M. catarrhalis. an immune response to one or more microbial pathogens has been used recently to define further the role of bacteria in individual episodes. the American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Physicians, and the American Society for Internal Medicine systematically analyzed 11 randomized, placebo-controlled studies of antibiotic treatment. a small but statistically significant improvement with antibiotic therapy was especially significant in patients with low baseline flow rates. clinical response in these trials is generally similar among different antimicrobial classes. more recent trials using novel experimental designs have suggested interesting differences between different antimicrobial classes. an early study showed equivalence between antibiotics in short-term clinical response. failure to clear the organism from the sputum post-therapy was associated with a shorter DFI. the effect of antibiotic class on DFI remains a crucial endpoint for future studies. macrolides are macrocyclical lactones consisting of greater than 8-membered rings. the most commonly, clinically used agents are semi-synthetic 14-, 15-, or 16-membered ring antibiotics related to erythromycin. these include erythromycin, roxithromycin and clarithromycin as typical members of the 14-member class, and azithromycin as the prototypical 15-member compound. macrolides exert a host of effects that collectively limit tissue damage by neutrophils. these include inhibiting their oxidant burst, impairing degranulation, and increasing the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. macrolides exert diverse actions that could mitigate neutrophilic inflammation central to airway damage. macrolides accumulate within the microbes over time, suppress elaboration of elastase, lecithinase, and pyocyanin. macrolides destroy pseudomonal biofilm, facilitating killing by other antibiotics. rokitamycin has potent bactericidal activity against susceptible organisms. the American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Physicians, and the American Society for Internal Medicine systematically analyzed 11 randomized, placebo-controlled studies of

compared newer agents with established ones. clinical response in these trials is generally similar among different antimicrobial classes. more recent trials using novel experimental designs have

DPB. the presence of airflow obstruction and chronic sinusitis in a nonsmoker should immediately raise suspicion of DPB. -defensins have noted to be elevated in the BAL fluid of DPB patients. plasma concentration of -defensin 2 (HBD-2) correlating with concentration in BAL fluid. all these findings support a central role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of DPB. improved symptoms, pulmonary function and arterial blood gases have been noted regardless of the presence of Pseudomonas infection. the effect of macrolides is unlikely to exclusively reflect an antibacterial effect. clinical improvement may be seen despite lack of change in bacterial isolates. macrolide therapy decreases the percentage of BAL lymphocytes and BAL concentration of HBD-2. this suggests a primary effect on the pathogenic process. the similarities to potential effects in COPD are evident. PCR-positive patients treated with clarithromycin experienced a decrease in TNF-, IL-5 and IL-12 mRNA in BAL and TNF- mRNA in airway tissue. PCR-negative patients treated with clarithromycin showed decreased TNF- and IL-12 mRNA in BAL and TNF- mRNA. bronchial hygiene, control of bronchial hemorrhage, surgical resection of extremely damaged/focal disease and reduction of excessive pulmonary inflammation. investigators have confirmed an intense cellular infiltrate with mononuclear cells, a prominent neutrophilia and increased IL-8 expression. increased expression of IL-8 and other potent chemoattractants have also been reported. erythromycin (500 mg bid) was administered for eight weeks to 11 patients with bronchiectasis. patients treated with macrolides experienced an improvement in spirometry and 24-hour sputum volume. no parallel improvement in sputum pathogens, sputum leukocytes, or levels of IL-1, IL-8, TNF- or LTB4. the most widely reported outcome has been a modest improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Miyatake et al 1991; Shimizu et al 1994; Kamoi et al 1995; Amayasu et al 2000; Kostadima et al 2004). clinical response has been more difficult to judge in uncontrolled studies. a multicenter, multinational study of 232 adults with mild to moderate asthma and serological evidence of C. pneumoniae infection randomized patients to roxithromycin 150 mg bid or placebo for six weeks. a modest increase in peak expired flow was noted in the macrolide treated patients after six weeks; daytime and nighttime symptoms showed nonsignificant improvements. differences may reflect disparity in patient characteristics at baseline, differing macrolides administered, and differing definition of an atypical infection. bronchiectasis patients with P. aeruginosa in the sputum have more severely impaired pulmonary function and greater sputum volume. these patients also exhibit the highest concentration of TNF- and LTB4 (Tsang et al 2000). putum production in 16 patients with bronchiectasis (n = 11) or chronic bronchitis (n = 5) treated with clarithromycin (400 mg/day) compared to patients treated with amoxicillin or cefaclor. only modest improvements were noted in pulmonary function. the survival of CF patients harboring Pseudomonas aeruginosa is shorter than that of CF patients uninfected by Pseudomonas. a series of studies have confirmed the benefit of macrolide therapy in CF. colleagues (2003) performed a multi-centered, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of 185 patients who were chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. the percent predicted FEV1 improved in the azithromycin group (4.4%), whereas it declined in the placebo group (1.8%, p = 0.001).
