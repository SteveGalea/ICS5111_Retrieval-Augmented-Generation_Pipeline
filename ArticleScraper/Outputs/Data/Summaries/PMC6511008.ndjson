{"summary": "crystal structure of nsP2h (amino acid residues 1\u2013465 of nsP2) was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled nsP2h proteins. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 complex was refined to obtain a good-quality structure with Rwork and Rfree values. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. the nsP2h structure is composed of multiple domains, including a small but uniquely folded N-terminal domain (NTD), the SF1 familiar accessory domains 1B and the Stalk -helix. the connector, which serves as an extension of the helicase, connected the bottom part of both RecA1 and RecA2 domains to form the ATP entry tunnel. the crystal structure revealed a unique mode of RNA recognition by the nsP2h. K211 located within motif Ia was in contact with phosphates of the last three ribonucleotides (U6\u2013A8). T233, D235, and S236 located within motif Ia interacted with phosphates of the first ribonucleotide (U2) and ribonucleotides U4 and U5 respectively. ADP-AlF4 was tightly bound at the ATPase active site between the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. the side chain -amino group of K192 coordinated the - and -phosphate groups directly as well as the -phosphate group via a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond. presence of Mg2+ ions in the helicase protein has been shown to be essential for RNA helicase activity (8). RNA binding alone resulted in mild protection, as indicated by a slightly slower HDX between nsP2h and the solvent. stronger protection against solvent exchange was observed in sequences within motif I, Ia, III, IV, V, Va, and VI. the sequence (amino acids 420\u2013460) within the connector was the only region that showed some increased deuterium incorporation, likely due to the closed ATP binding cleft. no significant conformational changes were observed in the N-terminal accessory domains in the ternary complex. nsP2h shows limited conformational changes on the top of the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. nsP2h shows a closed conformation, in which both the N-terminal region and the helicase region are engaged in binding to RNA and ATP. nsP2h was digested into smaller fragments by trypsin after incubation for 0.5 h. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 was more thermostable and resistant against trypsin digestion and deuterium exchange compared with apo nsP2h or nsP2h\u2013RNA14. bindings of RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 might trigger closed the conformational rearrangements in the nsP2h helicase core. the mutant protein also showed approximately twofold less effectiveness with a kcat/Km value of 0.21 s1M1. the mutant protein also showed approximately twofold less effectiveness with a kcat/Km value of 0.21 s1M1 and less binding affinity with a Kd value of 760.0 nM. RNA14 exerted little stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of the CHIKV nsP2h or its mutant F287A. RNA14 was unable to significantly stimulate the ATPase activity of the CHIKV nsP2h. viral RNA replication was analyzed using the CHIKV trans-replicase system. the cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression plasmid CMV-P1234 was used to express P1234, whereas an RNA template containing firefly luciferase (Fluc) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporters was produced using the human RNA polymerase I promoter. replicase containing the F287A substitution increased Fluc expression level to levels comparable to those found with the WT replicase. only a minor increase (0.1% of that achieved with the WT replicase) in Gluc activity was detected. effects of mutations on CHIKV replicase activity. control cells were transfected with the pol I-Fluc-Gluc and CMV-P1234. mutant variants harboring mutations resulting in the DD466-467AA substitution (GAA) in nsP4. each column represents an average from three independent experiments. the capsid protein is shown in green and is located below the actin protein. an unspecific protein band above that of actin was detected by anti-CHIKV capsid antibodies. we subsequently evaluated the effects of mutations in template-RNA sequences. KV constructs containing the above-listed mutations were below the detection limit (2 pfu/g DNA) this result was expected because it correlated to the lack of genomic RNA synthesis observed in the trans-replicase assays. the virus containing the F287A substitution was rescued, even though it reached a strongly diminished titer. the mutant virus restored its ability to express high levels of SG RNA through pseudoreversion. the mutation attenuated the infectivity of CHIKV, but the rescued virus possessed adaptive abilities. the effects of all three mutations on trans-replicase were nearly identical. top hits of SF1 RNA helicases shared slightly higher similarity to nsP2h. the structure of toMV-hel (Fig. 5B) bound to a nucleotide analog was the most similar to that of nsP2h. RNA\u2013nsP2h interface consisted of stacking interactions between nsP2h and the ssRNA between conserved hydrophobic residues from the N-terminal region of the helicase and RNA bases. however, none of the top hit RNA helicases contained an extended -helical connector close to the catalytic site. the stacking interactions and the connector are critical for the replication of CHIKV. crystal structure of nsP2h (amino acid residues 1\u2013465 of nsP2) was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled nsP2h proteins. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 complex was refined with a native dataset to a resolution of 2.00. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex structure. nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary complex. the nsP2h structure is composed of multiple domains, including a small but uniquely folded N-terminal domain (NTD), the SF1 familiar accessory domains 1B and the Stalk -helix. the nsP2h helicase core consisted of the RecA1 (green) and RecA2 (cyan) domains, with RNA-binding motifs lying on top of the two domains and an ATPase active site between the two domains T233, D235, and S236 located within motif Ia interacted with phosphates of the last three ribonucleotides (U6\u2013A8). motif IV interacted with phosphates of the first ribonucleotide (U2) and ribonucleotides U4 and U5 respectively. the side chain -amino group of K192 (motif I) coordinated the - and -phosphate groups directly and the -phosphate group via a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond. the presence of Mg2+ ions in the helicase protein has been shown to be essential for RNA helicase activity (8). binding of RNA and ADP-AlF4 affected conformational dynamics of nsP2h in solution. RNA binding alone resulted in mild protection, as indicated by a slightly slower HDX between nsP2h and the solvent. strongest protection against solvent exchange was observed in sequences within motif I, Ia, III, IV, V, Va, and VI. connector was the only region that showed some increased deuterium incorporation. it is also noteworthy that no significant conformational changes were observed in the N-terminal accessory domains in the ternary complex. nsP2h shows limited conformational changes on the top of the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. nsP2h shows a closed conformation, in which both the N-terminal region and the helicase region are engaged in binding to RNA and ATP. nsP2h was more resistant to trypsin digestion after incubation for 0.5 h (lane 6) and 2 h (lane 9) in the presence of both RNA14 and nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 was more thermostable and resistant against trypsin digestion and deuterium exchange compared with apo nsP2h or nsP2h\u2013RNA14. bindings of RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 might trigger closed the conformational rearrangements in the nsP2h helicase core, which resembles the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. the mutant protein showed approximately twofold less effectiveness with a kcat/Km value of 0.21 s1M1 and less binding affinity with a Kd value of 760.0 nM compared with WT nsP2h. the mutant protein also showed approximately twofold less effectiveness with a kcat/Km value of 0.21 s1M1 and less binding affinity with a Kd value of 760.0 nM. RNA14 exerted little stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of the CHIKV nsP2h or its mutant F287A. RNA binding alone did not induce significant conformational changes to the helicase/ATPase. cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression plasmid CMV-P1234 was used to express P1234, whereas an RNA template containing firefly luciferase (Fluc) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporters was produced using the human RNA polymerase I promoter (pol I-Fluc-Gluc; Fig. 4A) the replicase containing the F287A substitution increased the Fluc expression level to levels comparable to those found with the WT replicase. the mutant mutant variants harbored the Y161A, F164A, Y161A+. the mutant mutant mutants were cotransfected with pol I-Fluc-Gluc and CMV-P1234. control cells were transfected with pol I-Fluc-Gluc and CMV-P1234. the mutants harbored mutations resulting in the DD466-467AA substitution (GAA) in nsP4. the cells were lysed at 18 h posttransfection. each column represents an average from three independent experiments. an unspecific protein band above that of actin was detected by anti-CHIKV capsid antibodies. we subsequently evaluated the effects of mutations in template-RNA sequences. the results showed that the residue corresponding to U5 of RNA14 was critical for CHIKV replication. the lethal nature of these substitutions was confirmed by the lack of infectious virus progeny and capsid protein expression in transfected cells. the virus containing the F287A substitution was rescued, even though it reached a strongly diminished titer (7.87 103 pfu/mL) four of the remaining clones contained the V410-to-Ile (V410I) substitution. remaining clones contained the T358-to-Ser (T358S) substitution. the mutation attenuated the infectivity of CHIKV, but the rescued virus possessed adaptive abilities. ssRNA-Upf1 and ssDNA-EAV nsp10 were bound to ssRNA and ssDNA on top of the helicase core domains. ssRNA-Upf1 and ssDNA-EAV nsp10 were only made through backbone phosphates and nonspecific protein\u2013base interactions. RNA\u2013nsP2h interface consisted of stacking interactions between nsP2h and the ssRNA between conserved hydrophobic residues from the N-terminal region of the helicase and RNA bases. however, none of the top hit RNA helicases contained an extended -helical connector close to the catalytic site. the nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 with similar SF1 helicases further support CHIKV nsP2h bound to conserved 3\u2032 end of genomic RNA (RNA14) contains the NTD, the domain 1B, the stalk, the RecA1 domain, the RecA2 domain, and the connector. the accessory NTD and the connector are relatively small but uniquely wrapped around the conserved helicase core. nsP2 depends on the precise sequence of its NTD. the nsP2h structure was not directly involved in RNA14 binding. the NTD helps nsP2 regulate ns-polyprotein processing and coordinate the viral RNA replication process. the structure of upf1 shares only a low level of structural similarity with nsP2h. the residue is strictly conserved as a phenylalanine among alphaviruses. in other SF1 helicases, residues with smaller hydrophobic side chains are more common (42) the replicase containing the F287A substitution displayed active genomic RNA synthesis. nsP2h with no C-terminal protease region lacks RNA helicase activity (8). this finding raises a question about the role of the C-terminal protease in helping the function of the N-terminal helicase part of nsP2. das et al. (8) suggested that the MTL domain from the C-terminal part of nsP2 could strengthen RNA\u2013nsP2 binding. further investigations are needed to study the structure of RNA\u2013full-length nsP2 and the functional cross-talk within domains.
