{"summary": "coronavirus entry is inhibited by targeting the ATP1A1 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase with either gene silencing or low concentrations of cardiotonic steroids. these results suggest that impeding Na+,K+-ATPase function using cardiotonic steroids may be an attractive therapeutic approach against coronavirus infections. the pestivirus helicase is compatible with its molecular motor function for translocation along nucleic acid strands. this feature, likely shared with all SF2 helicases, suggests strategies to block molecular motion may have antiviral utility. potyviral coat protein (CP) is thought to switch viral RNA from translation and replication to encapsidation."}
