{"summary": "Pork production is expected to decline 6\u20137% in 2014 due to a decrease in the number of hogs that may range from 3 to 11%. the devastating effect of PEDv is mainly due to the acute watery diarrhea induced in infected pigs, which may lead to a high (50\u201380%) mortality. vaccinated for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSv) data included information on the site in which pigs were located, pig source (sow farm from which pigs originated), start and close period on each site, number of pigs per batch, mortality (defined by percentage of total pigs started), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion (FCR control batches leaving sow farms within the first two weeks were excluded from the analysis. target parameters (mortality, ADG, ADFI, and FCR) of infected and control groups were compared using the Wilcoxon test. the identity of the data provider cannot be disclosed due to legal restrictions. a retrospective cohort study was carried out in which the exposed group was the first PED-positive batch from a given flow (infected batch) and the unexposed group (control batch) was defined as the batch that had left the sow farm immediately before the exposed group. records were screened to identify PED-positive flows. sow farm originated from up to five different sow farms. the other three originated from up to five different sow farms. the other three originated from a single sow farm. nursery flows produced 23 batches of weaned pigs, with a mean time between batches of 19 days. 82 batches were produced by the 14 WF flows. pigs from only 3 of the 82 WF batches weaned before the outbreak were on feed for >150 days. ADG was lower in WF batches compared with previous four months. ADFI observed in the outbreak batches did not increase in WF batches. Mortality was significantly (p0.001) higher in PED-positive batches compared with control pigs. average daily gain (ADG, Fig. 3a) and feed conversion ratio (FCR, Fig. 3b) observed in paired batches from 18 flows in the first batch produced after PED detection in the sow farms. mortality in piglets may be as high as 80% in the first days of the outbreak, but reaching 100% of the baseline production may take longer. a limited number of studies focused on defining baseline levels in grow-finish pigs. the variation observed in the batches produced before the outbreak likely reflects the impact of other variables not captured in the analysis. the absence of a visible trend in the mortality in a four month period supports the suitability of the selection of the control pair among batches produced within those 120 days. compared infected- and control-populations, in terms of breed, management and disease prevention procedures at the sow farm. but the period on feed for most of the pigs (only three PED- and one PED+ batch stayed >150 days) indicated that the study period in which performance was measured was very similar regardless of productive type of the site in which pigs were placed. infection with other pathogens could also increase mortality. the authors do not think that such effect has affected the results reported here. we believe that the most biologically sound explanation for the significantly poorer performance observed in PED+ batches was the infection with the virus. this makes it an attractive target to evaluate the importance of PEDv in growing pigs. mortality, ADG and FCR recorded in growing pigs were significantly poorer than those observed in pigs weaned 14 to 120 days before the introduction of PED. this is the first reported description of the effect of PEDv infection in performance of growing pigs that survive the infection at the sow farm."}
