{"summary": "the first human infections with the novel influenza A/H7N9 virus were reported in eastern china on 31 March 2013. the outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size, with a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by 3 June 2013 in 10 Chinese provinces and Taiwan. the incidence of A/H7N9 cases has stalled in recent weeks, presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas. zoonotic threats include avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases and 38 fatalities reported as of 3 June 2013. silent and undetected A/H7N9 infections in poultry increase the likelihood of zoonotic infections. preliminary studies suggest a low incidence of A/H7N9 infection in chickens and pigeons in affected areas. in this report, we estimate the transmission potential of the influenza A/H7N9 virus by relying on daily official notifications of laboratory-confirmed cases in mainland China. we compare R estimates for A/H7N9 with those for other zoonotic pathogens that have recently caused pandemic concern. posed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model to estimate R for influenza A/H7N9 [11,12,23]. the theoretical R value is a fixed (unknown) quantity, and R estimates are updated in a sequential Bayesian framework as data accumulate over time. this approach was previously applied to study the dynamics of the A/H5N1 influenza outbreaks in Asia [23], the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, USA [12], and the 2009 the progression operator is given by: b R,, = exp +, (2) Where + is the dominant eigenvalue derived from linearization of the SEIR model around disease-free equilibrium, following [15] + = + 2 - 1 + 1 + + 2 R - 1. both the latent and infectious periods (1/, 1/) are fixed and the only parameter to be estimated is R. t + C t R P R P C t + C t (5) where the denominator is a normalization factor. Equation (5) defines the sequential Bayesian estimation scheme. the posterior probability distribution of R can be used as a prior to generate a posterior distribution at the next time step. sensitivity analysis used a Negative Binomial log likelihood fit to account for over-dispersion in case counts. using the exponential model fit up to 6 April, we forecasted the expected number of A/H7N9 cases in subsequent weeks. an alternative approach to estimate R relies on the average size of chains of human-to-human transmission. we can use R estimates based on exposure and contact information [22,23] to set initial prior distributions for R in our Bayesian estimation scheme. confirmed A/H7N9 influenza in the provinces of Shanghai and Zhejiang according to date of symptoms onset. vertical dashed lines indicate timing of preemptive live bird market closure in Shanghai (6 April) and Zhejiang (15 April), respectively. cases are color coded by exposure history. in the Bayesian SEIR approach, we use a relationship that is directly applicable to time series data as it expresses the expected number of new cases over the time period. the relationship follows from a standard SEIR model [11,23]: E C t + = b R,, C t, (1) where E[C(t + ) is the expected number of new cases at time t +, b(R,, ) defines the progression of cases, -1 and -1 the distribution of new incident cases C(t + ) follows: C t + R C t + C t R (4) which states that C(t + ) only depends on the number of new cases at the previous time point C(t), given R. Equation (5) defines the sequential Bayesian estimation scheme, where the posterior probability distribution of R can be used as a prior to generate a posterior distribution at the next time step. a modified SEIR transmission process modeled spillover events as a constant daily rate of new infections arising from exposure to the reservoir. we used the model to simulate daily outbreak data, applied the Bayesian estimation method to these data and confronted the estimated R with the true R. we used an approach recently developed by Cauchemez et al. for zoonotic infections. in this approach, R = 1-p, where p is the estimated proportion of infected patients arising from direct contact with the A/H7N9 reservoir (scenario 1 in [20]) we simulated A/H7N9 influenza outbreaks using a modified SEIR transmission process. we varied the true R in the range 0.1 to 2.0 and modeled spillover events as a constant daily rate of new infections arising from exposure to the reservoir. we used the model to simulate daily outbreak data and applied the Bayesian estimation method to these data. using the exponential model fit up to 6 April, we forecasted the expected number of A/H7N9 cases in subsequent weeks. we confronted the progression of reported cases past 6 April against that predicted by the pre-intervention model as an indication of the effectiveness of control measures. 71.4% (50/70) of the influenza A/H7N9 cases reported in these provinces were associated with exposure to poultry and/or live bird markets. the incidence accelerated around 27 March 2013 in Shanghai (the first of three consecutive days with non-zero cases), and approximately two weeks later in Zhejiang on 8 April 2013. the progression of updated R estimates as data accumulate over time is shown in Figure 2 and 3 for each province. there was no significant change in estimated R as the outbreak progressed from February to May 2013 in either location. the initial prior for R is a normal distribution left-truncated at 0 and centered at 0.2 (SD = 0.2) SEIR, susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed. the posterior mean of R and upper 95% credible interval remained below the epidemic threshold (R = 1) as epidemiological data accumulated, no matter the prior. the proportion of A/H7N9 patients arising from human-to-human transmission is approximately equal to R, when 0.1 R 0.9 [see Additional file 1: Figure S4] additional sensitivity analyses considering longer latent and infectious periods did significantly change R estimates. based on an exponential model fit to the progression of reported cases. black dots indicate the progression of reported A/H7N9 cases. vertical dashed lines indicate timing of preemptive live bird market closures in Shanghai (6 April) and Zhejiang (15 April), respectively. analysis of cluster size distribution from [22] Other zoonotic influenza viruses Avian influenza H5N1 -2003 to 2006, SE Asia and Egypt/Turkey 0.29 Cluster size distribution approach [21]. an alternative R estimate is provided by the average distribution of secondary chains of transmission. inclusion of one additional suspected cluster of size two identified by contact tracing results in a slightly higher estimate of R = 5/126 = 0.04. estimates are based on a variety of approaches, including transmission model fitting methods and individual-level exposure history approaches. estimates are based on a variety of approaches, including transmission model fitting methods. early outbreaks in Malaysia in the late 1990s were associated with low transmission potential. more recent outbreaks in Bangladesh in 2001 to 2007 were characterized by a higher frequency of human-to-human transmission, with R approximately 0.51 [20,21]. a similar estimate was obtained by analyzing the cluster size distribution. vertical dashed lines indicate the timing of the preemptive live bird market closures in Shanghai (6 April) evolution of R estimates as data accumulate over time, assuming a prolonged serial interval of six days. horizontal dotted line indicates the threshold at R = 1, above which large epidemics are expected to occur. estimates and 95% credible intervals of the reproduction number, R, for the A/H7N9 influenza outbreak in china. sensitivity analysis on the prior distribution for R confirmed that there was high uncertainty in the posterior estimates of R. simulations indicate that the Bayesian estimation approach tends to overestimate R, especially when the true R is low and spillover events are frequent. case data from Shanghai and Zhejiang suggest that the reported rate of spillover transmission from the reservoir was in the order of approximately one daily infection in the pre-intervention period. the model identifies a statistically significant departure from predicted incidence by 18 April and throughout the end of the study period. a similar pattern was obtained by using nationally aggregated incidence data instead of province-level data. of the 130 cases, 67% reported a history of poultry exposure (88/122; eight have unknown exposure information), including 47% of patients who visited live bird markets. an upper bound for R is provided by assuming a stricter definition of exposure solely based on exposure to live bird markets (the hypothetical reservoir), which yields an upper R estimate of 1\u20130.47 = 0.53. influenza pandemic 1.5 [33] growth rate 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic 1.2 to 3.1 [17,34-40] Various approaches Seasonal influenza 1.3 [41,42] growth rate Other zoonotic viruses Nipah virus, Bangladesh, 1990s 0.05 to 0.08 Exposure-based approach [20]; data from [43] Nipah virus, Bangladesh, 2000s 0.48 to 0.51 Exposure-based and cluster size distribution approaches [20] estimates in the range 0.52 to 0.54 have been proposed for A/H5N1 in Thailand and Indonesia, based on a Bayesian approach similar to that used here [11]. the swine-origin influenza virus has recently become a cause of concern in the US. a deceleration in growth rate in mid April is consistent with preemptive live bird market closures initiated in early April. our estimation framework was robust to assumptions about the duration of the infectious and latent periods, whether we considered a short serial interval characteristic of seasonal influenza [25] or a prolonged disease course more consistent with early case descriptions. occurrence of three (perhaps four) family clusters of A/H7N9 cases consistent with short chains of human to human transmission. these clusters do not rule out exposure to common environmental or animal sources. we observed a reduction in growth rate of H7N9 cases in mid to late April. the lack of observed shift is further evidence that R is low and most likely below 0.6. alternative methods based on contact tracing and exposure information are attractive. they depend heavily on prior knowledge of the ecology of the disease. serological surveys conducted at the end of 2012 in china and Vietnam revealed low levels of prior infections [50,51]. Moreover, influenza-like-illness surveillance suggests that A/H7N9 infection was an uncommon cause of illness in any age group during March and April 2013 in the most affected areas of China [52]. the available epidemiological data on influenza A/H7N9 are consistent with subcritical transmission potential below R = 0.6 in the first three months of virus circulation in Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. decline in the growth rate of influenza A/H7N9 cases in April 2013 highlights the beneficial impact of live bird market closures. the research was conducted in the context of the Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS), an on-going international collaborative effort to understand influenza epidemiological and evolutionary patterns. funding for this project comes in part (LS) from the RAPIDD program of the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Global Affairs\u2019 International Influenza Unit."}
