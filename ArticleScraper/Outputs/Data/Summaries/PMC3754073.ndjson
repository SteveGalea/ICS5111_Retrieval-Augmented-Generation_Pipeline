{"summary": "coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species and cause respiratory or enteric diseases (1, 2). the collection of known human coronaviruses (HCoVs), all of which are responsible for respiratory infections, has grown steadily since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002. largely dispensable spacer B (5, 8) and carboxy-terminal domain N3, which mediates binding of the nucleocapsid to the membrane protein (M) of the virion envelope (6, 7, 12, 13) connecting the two RNA-binding domains is domain N2a, the first half of which is taken up by a serine- and arginine-rich tract. the region between ADRP and Ubl2-PLP2 corresponds to the SARS unique domain (SUD) in SARS-CoV nsp3 (71); although the SUD comprises three structural subdomains (72), nothing is known about its highly divergent MHV counterpart. some work suggests that N protein is required as an RNA chaperone to assist the template-switching steps central to coronavirus subgenomic mRNA transcription. two classes of reverting mutations were found to rescue the BCoV mutant. the first mapped to the SR region of the N protein. the second type of reverting mutation was also rescued by compensatory mutations in the SR region. we found that expressed Ubl1-Ac protein specifically bound to N protein from infected cells in a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay. we hypothesized that the role of the association of N with nsp3 is to colocalize genomic RNA with the nascent replicase-transcriptase complex. wild-type, mutant, and revertant virus stocks of MHV strain A59 were propagated in mouse 17 clone 1 (17Cl1) cells. plaque titrations and plaque purifications were performed in mouse L2 cells. reverse genetics procedures reported here involved the manipulation of MHV cDNA clone A or clone G. the cDNA insert of clone A was subcloned into a pUC8-related vector to produce clone pBar-A3. for the Bcl-Spe(BCoV) mutant, a BclI-SpeI fragment of BCoV cDNA (running from the end of nsp plasmid pA3B3 was synthesized by PCR from random-primed viral cDNA. pA3B3 contained an exact substitution of the BCoV Ubl1 and Ac domains. clone A constructs for the generation of Ubl1 mutants were made by replacement of pA3B3 with fragments synthesized by PCR from overlapping oligonucleotides. confluent monolayers of 17Cl1 cells (75 cm2) were inoculated at a multiplicity of 0.01 or 5.0 PFU per cell for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, with rocking every 15 min. aliquots of medium were withdrawn at various times from 2 to 48 h postinfection, and infectious titers were determined. mRNA integrity was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated by A260. transfected cells were then diluted into 1.5 107 fresh L2 cells. plaques were counted after 48 h of incubation. vectors pCKN2b, pCKNBd3, and pCK15 were created from pCK70XB through religation of blunted ends. pCK13 was made by replacement of the XhoI-ApaI fragment of pCK70XB with the corresponding fragment of the previously described pA10413 (8). 106 cells/ml contained 10% fetal bovine serum. MHV mutants were engineered with the infectious cDNA system for MHV A59. cDNA isolations were performed at 33\u00b0C. plasmid pA3B2 was generated by PCR amplification of random-primed cDNA produced from a stock of wild-type BCoV that was obtained from David Brian. the resulting plasmid, pA3B2, contained (i) an exact substitution of the BCoV Ubl1 domain, as defined in Results. MHV clone A constructs for the generation of Ubl1 mutants 1 to 3 and the Ubl1 mutant were made by replacement of the XbaI-SalI fragment of pA3B3 with fragments synthesized by PCR from overlapping oligonucleotides. plasmid pG1B1, containing an exact substitution of the BCoV N gene for the MHV N gene, was created by the transfer of the fragment the enhancement of the infectivity of MHV gRNA by N mRNA was measured by cotransfection of both RNA species via electroporation. wild-type and mutant viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation. the entire mixture of cells was seeded into three 20-cm2 dishes. cells were overlaid with 0.9% agar in Eagle's MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. plaques were counted after 48 h of incubation. vectors for MHV N-related mRNAs were generated from pCK70XB. the vector for wild-type BCoV mRNA, pB60, and its derivative pB60SL have been described previously (23) the vector for the BCoV M-SR mutant, pB60-MSR, was obtained by replacement of the Bsu36I-SpeI fragment of pCK70XB with the corresponding fragment of pCK70XB. Fig 2. Inexact substitution of the MHV-BCoV chimeric portion of the replicase polyprotein and the MHV wild-type N protein encoded by the Bcl-Spe(BCoV) mutant. Arrows denote the positions of the most common reverting mutations in nsp2 and nsp3. revertant genomes were sequenced from upstream of the substitution boundary in nsp2 through part of the ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) domain in nsp3, as well as in part of the N protein spanning the SR region. no second-site mutations were found in N. sequence changes introduced by our substitution of the BCoV nsp2-nsp3 cleavage site in place of that of MHV. the phenotype of the Bcl-Spe(BCoV) mutant was unrelated to the N-nsp3 interaction. we then generated two nsp3 chimeras, designated Ubl1(BCoV) and Ubl1-Ac(BCoV) nsp3 and wild-type MHV mutants encode chimeric portion of nsp3. chimeric portion of nsp3 encoded by nsp3 and wild-type nsp3. nsp3 and wild-type nsp3 mutants encode amino acid residues. two isolates of the Ubl1-Ac(BCoV) mutant formed plaques that were identical to those of the wild type at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C. this result ruled out the possibility of compensatory second-site mutations anywhere else in the genome. both of these were determined to have the constructed substitution in nsp3. we obtained two independent isolates of this mutant. one had a low-to-undetectable frequency of revertants in early-passage stocks. this virus formed tiny plaques at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C and had a pronounced temperature sensitivity. the other N(BCoV) isolate was completely overrun by a revertant at the earliest passage. this virus was found to have a novel reverting mutation, S200Y, in the SR region of the BCoV N protein. the reconstructed mutant recapitulated the phenotype of the previously created BCoV N mutant (Alb613) (23) both independent isolates that we obtained for the Ubl1/N(BCoV) mutant formed plaques that approached wild-type size at 33 and 37\u00b0C, but at 39\u00b0C their plaques were just marginally larger than those of the N(BCoV) mutant. the original Ubl1/N(BCoV) isolate contained a spurious mutation arising from reverse genetics manipulations that was responsible for its reduced plaque size at 39\u00b0C. growth of the Ubl1/N(BCoV) mutant was only slightly delayed. both viruses reached comparable peak titers at 12 to 16 h postinfection. growth of the mutant lagged about 2 h behind the wild type. Ubl1/N(BCoV) or wild-type virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5.0 PFU per cell (A) or with Ubl1/N(BCoV), N(BCoV) or wild-type virus at a multiplicity of 0.01 PFU per cell (B) at indicated times postinfection, aliquots of medium were removed, and infectious titers were determined by plaque assay on L2 cells. plaques of Ubl1-mut1 were slightly smaller than those of the wild type at 39\u00b0C. there were no additional mutations in the first 600 residues of nsp3 or in the entire N protein. the Ac domain of BCoV-HKU1 is poorly conserved and harbors from 2 to 17 copies of an acidic decapeptide repeat (47, 48). the Ac domain of BCoV-HKU1 is poorly conserved and harbors from 2 to 17 copies of an acidic decapeptide repeat (47, 48). the pronounced size difference between the Ac domains of MHV and BCoV raised the possibility that the larger MHV Ac domain was somehow responsible for the inability of the BCoV N protein to interact with the Ubl1 domain of nsp3. we constructed a mutant, designated Ac2(MHV)/N(BCoV), in which the Ac2 deletion was paired with the BCoV N substitution. this result ruled out the possibility that the failure of the BCoV BCoV N mRNA acquired activity if it contained an SR region-reverting mutation (23). we therefore concluded there was a critical relationship between the N-nsp3 interaction and the initiation of coronavirus infection. cotransfections of wild-type MHV gRNA with mRNAs for wild-type MHV N, wild-type BCoV N, BCoV N containing the SR region of MHV N. cotransfections of wild-type MHV gRNA with mRNAs for wild-type MHV N, wild-type BCoV N, and BCoV N containing the reverting mutation S202L. a mutant designated HK-SR had a phenotype indistinguishable from that of wild-type MHV. in a mutant designated HK-SR, the replacement of the MHV N SR region with that from HCoV-HKU1 was previously found to be lethal (23). in an analogous manner, S-SR N mRNA showed only a minimal ability to augment the infectivity of MHV gRNA. nsp3, specifically the Ubl1 domain of nsp3, is required in conjunction with N protein for the initiation of infection by coronavirus gRNA. truncation of either the amino terminus (mutant N1a) or the carboxy terminus (mutant NB3) had little or no effect on the enhancement of infectivity by N. the function of domain N1a, if any, is unknown. two deletion mutations abolished mRNA stimulatory activity in MHV. the results show that the SR region as well as both RNA-binding domains of N are required for its enhancement of gRNA infectivity. MHV gRNA is synthesized from a full-length genomic cDNA. it is assembled through the directed in vitro ligation of seven cloned cDNA fragments. in this interval, the MHV and BCoV replicase proteins share 37% amino acid sequence identity, with the highest divergence falling in the Ac domain of nsp3. two independent isolates of the Bcl-Spe(BCoV) mutant were obtained. the mutant formed plaques at 33\u00b0C that were noticeably smaller than those of the wild type. at 37\u00b0C, plaques were tiny, and mutant titers were 100-fold lower than at 33\u00b0C. in the BCoV portion of PLP1, the mutation K234T arose in eight of the nine revertants, which collectively represented three independent sets. this strongly implied that in the Bcl-Spe(BCoV) mutant there was an incompatibility between the mostly MHV PLP1 and one of its substrates, the BCoV nsp2-nsp3 cleavage site, which varies from its MHV counterpart at three of 10 positions boundaries of the Ubl1 and Ac domains were based on alignment of the nsp3 sequences of numerous betacoronaviruses (45, 46), as well as the available structure of SARS-CoV Ubl1 (27) and in vitro mapping of the upstream limit of MHV PLP1. in both mutants, the Ubl1 domain substitution was designed to begin at the fourth residue of BCoV nsp3. one isolate formed plaques that were indistinguishable from those of the wild type at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C. the other had smaller plaques than the wild type at all three temperatures. the second isolate was due to an extraneous mutation near the cleavage site of the S protein (A703D) the MHV N protein was entirely competent to interact with nsp3 containing either BCoV Ubl1 alone or BCoV Ubl1 plus Ac. this nonreciprocal relationship extended across an even greater phylogenetic distance. this result was striking in light of our previous finding that an MHV mutant N protein harboring the SR region of the SARS-CoV N protein was nonfunctional unless it additionally contained compensating mutations in the SR region. one isolate had low-to-undetectable frequency of revertants in early-passage stocks. this virus formed tiny plaques at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C and had a pronounced temperature sensitivity. this isolate contained the entire wild-type BCoV N gene. arrows denote the positions of three reverting mutations that arose in isolates of the N(BCoV) mutant. mutants formed plaques that approached wild-type size at 33 and 37\u00b0C, but at 39\u00b0C their plaques were just marginally larger than those of the wild type. the original Ubl1/N(BCoV) isolate contained a spurious mutation arising from the reverse genetics manipulation. two independent isolates of the Ubl1-Ac/N(BCoV) mutant appeared wild-type-like at 33 and 37\u00b0C but not at 39\u00b0C. compared the growth kinetics of the Ubl1/N(BCoV) mutant and wild-type MHV at 37\u00b0C. growth of the mutant was only slightly delayed with respect to that of the wild type. the curve corrected for revertant plaques is an overestimate at times after 12 h. a second, independent growth experiment was identical to those shown in Fig. 5. we concluded that substitution of the BCoV Ubl1 domain is sufficient. MHV Ubl1-mut1 (K22A R104A) altered two conserved basic residues. in Ubl1-mut2 (D94A E95A D98A E99A) four conserved and adjacent acidic residues were changed to alanines. mutants in MHV/N(BCoV) mutant at 37\u00b0C are lethal. monolayers were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection. deletion of all structured segments of Ubl1 was lethal. two or three independent isolates of each mutant were obtained. none of isolates had additional mutations in the first 600 residues of nsp3 or in the entire N protein. the viability of the constructs revealed that, unlike Ubl1, the Ac domain is nonessential. bl1 is due to obstruction by the MHV Ac domain of nsp3. it reinforced the conclusion that the N-nsp3 interaction maps solely to the Ubl1 domain of nsp3. coronavirus gRNA is only minimally infectious upon transfection. Alb240 (54) is nearly identical in sequence to wild-type MHV reconstructed by the full-length cDNA reverse genetics system (42). Fig 7. Abilities of interspecies chimeric N proteins to enhance the infectivity of genomic RNA. cotransfected wild-type MHV N mRNA stimulated the infectivity of wild-type MHV gRNA at least 25-fold. in contrast, wild-type BCoV mRNA was nearly inert, although we were now able to detect some small residual activity relative to that of the negative control that had no cotransfected mRNA. encoding chimeric nsp3 molecules allowed us to directly test whether nsp3 was relevant to the requirement for N protein for optimal gRNA infectivity. for both mutant gRNAs, we observed a high degree of stimulation by wild-type BCoV N mRNA. this finding sharply contrasts with the inability of BCoV N mRNA to enhance the infectivity of wild-type MHV gRNA. truncation of either the amino terminus (mutant N1a) or the carboxy terminus (mutant NB3) had little or no effect on the enhancement of infectivity by N. the function of domain N1a, if any, is unknown. removal of either of the RNA-binding domains of N abolished mRNA stimulatory activity. cotransfections of wild-type MHV gRNA with wild-type MHV mRNA or mRNA encoding each of the N deletion mutants were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 7. each histogram represents the mean infectious titer ( standard deviation) from four separate transfections. wild-type-like phenotypes suggest that BCoV nsp3 is less discriminating than MHV nsp3 in binding to its own N protein or to related N proteins. this complementation clearly established that the BCoV N protein is fully functional in MHV, provided it is able to interact with its cognate Ubl1. binding to nsp6 was detected by a yeast two-hybrid assay. binding to nsp8 and nsp9 was observed by a pulldown assay. in the future we hope to design mutants based on the recently reported structure of MHV Ubl1 (41). PLP1 was shown to be only minimally viable, but was rescued by deletion of its substrates, the nsp1-nsp2 and nsp2-nsp3 cleavage sites. this implied that the inactive PLP1 in the original mutant was obstructing other crucial functions of nsp3 by remaining bound to one or both of its cleavage sites. this implied that the inactive PLP1 in the original mutant was obstruct reverting mutations in the SR region of the BCoV N protein compensated for the defect of the BCoV N mutant. MHV N mRNA substituted with the HCoV-HKU1 SR region was highly active, reflecting the wild-type-like phenotype of the previously obtained HK-SR viral mutant. a series of N mRNAs deleting each of the previously defined domains of the N molecule. result also ruled out the possibility that the consistently observed inactivity of BCoV N mRNA with wild-type MHV gRNA was trivially due to some undetected flaw in the mRNA. sid structure at the 3\u2032 end of the genome would allow its immediate association with nsp3. it could confine repeated rounds of genome translation to a restricted locus. it could recruit the genome to the replication compartment while that compartment is beginning to be shaped through remodeling of intracellular membranes. further dissection of the interaction may provide a starting point for unraveling a large number of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions essential to coronavirus RNA synthesis. a similar caution would apply to other chimeric substitutions among the 16 subunits of the coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex. a similar caution would apply to other chimeric substitutions among the 16 subunits of the coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex. the mutants suggest that BCoV nsp3 is less discriminating than MHV nsp3 in binding to its own N protein. these results suggest that the N-nsp3 interaction is essential. we cannot rule out the possibility that there exists some other critical role for Ubl1 that contributes to the lethality of the Ubl1-mut2 mutants. an active-site catalytic residue mutant of MHV PLP1 was shown to be only minimally viable. this implied that the inactive PLP1 in the original mutant was obstructing other crucial functions of nsp3 by remaining bound to one or both of its cleavage sites. it is not yet clear whether this mutation affects a known or a novel activity of nsp3. plicon systems have documented a marked requirement for N protein in coronavirus RNA synthesis. it is not agreed upon whether the basis for this effect resides in genome replication or transcription. transfected gRNA is only minimally infectious unless supplemented with a source of N protein. this need must occur at a very early step in the initiation of a productive infection. wild-type BCoV N mRNA was found to be fully active in stimulating the infectivity of gRNA from either the Ubl1(BCoV) mutant or the Ubl1-Ac(BCoV) mutant. this demonstrated that BCoV N mRNA was indeed functional when paired with complementary gRNA, i.e., gRNA that encodes a compatible version of nsp3. the role of the N-nsp3 interaction is to tether the infecting nucleocapsid to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex. this continued association between the genome and nsp3 could serve a number of purposes. it could confine repeated rounds of genome translation to a restricted locus."}
