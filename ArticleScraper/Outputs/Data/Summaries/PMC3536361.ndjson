{"summary": "CHIKV is an alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever. the virus was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania and spread across Africa and Southeast Asia. CHIKV infection has been associated with a new mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus. a number of successful vaccine approaches have been described recently. these include chimeric alphavirus vectors (8, 9), an adenovirus vector (10), a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine (11), a DNA vaccine (12) and an internal ribosome entry site-based live attenuated CHIKV vaccine (13). chimeric viruses could be generally applicable as alphavirus vaccines. pVSV-CHIKV was synthesized with flanking XhoI and NheI restriction sites. pCAGGS-CHIKV was made by deleting the VSV G gene from the pVSV-CHIKV by MluI-XhoI digestion, filling in with T4 DNA polymerase and religation. VSV-CHIKV was recovered by transferring the transfected cell supernatants onto fresh BHK-21 cells at 48 h posttransfection and collecting the supernatant containing the virus after another 48 h. a part of VSVG-CHIKV recovery supernatant was also plaque purified on BHK-G cells. cells were infected with recombinant wild-type (rwt)-VSV, VSV-CHIKV, or VSVG-CHIKV. at 4 h postinfection, cells were washed two times with PBS. cells were then washed with PBS containing 10 mM glycine (PBS-glycine) cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with detergent lysis buffer. rVSVs were infected with rwt-VSV, VSV-CHIKV, or VSVG-CHIKV. after 1 h, virus was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 5% FBS. supernatant samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postadsorption. supernatant samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postadsorption. titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. animals from each immunization group were divided into two subgroups. two animals from each group were sacrificed at 4 days postchallenge (38 dpi) CHIKV plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed using standard methods (31) and the CHIKV-LR strain. ELISPOT assay kit was used to quantify T-cell activation. spleenocytes were isolated from immunized mice at 7 dpi. pVSV-CHIKV was synthesized with flanking XhoI and NheI restriction sites. the gene was inserted into a modified pCAGGS vector (24) containing these sites. pVSV-CHIKV and pVSVG-CHIKV were recovered from pVSV-CHIKV. the cells were then transfected with rVSV plasmids (pVSV) plasmids, pBS-N, pBS-P, pBS-L, and pBS-G, encoding VSV proteins. the cells were then transferred to fresh BHK-21 cells at 48 h posttransfection and collected the supernatant containing the virus after another 48 h. the transfection mix was removed from the plate and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. cells were infected with recombinant wild-type (rwt)-VSV, VSV-CHIKV, or VSVG-CHIKV. cells were washed two times with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. cells were washed with methionine-free DMEM for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were labeled with 100 Ci of [35S]methionine in 1 ml of DMEM. lysates were collected and clarified at 16,000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatant samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postadsorption. supernatant samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postadsorption. titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. the wild-type CHIKV-LR strain was derived from a cDNA clone (3) using 104 PFU per mouse. animals from each immunization group were divided into two subgroups. two animals from each group were sacrificed at 4 days postchallenge. CHIKV plaque reduction neutralization tests were performed using standard methods. a gamma interferon (IFN-) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay kit was used to quantify T-cell activation following immunization. the plate was developed using 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC) chromogen diluted in AEC substrate buffer. the reaction was stopped by adding water, and the plate was air dried before spot-forming cells were counted. a synthetic gene encoding the CHIKV E3-E2-6K-E1 polyprotein was inserted between the G and L genes of VSV (Indiana) in the plasmid vector pV expression of CHIKV envelope proteins detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-VSV G MAb or anti-CHIKV mouse serum in infected (as indicated) BHK-21 cells were infected with VSV-CHIKV, VSVG-CHIKV, or rwt-VSV. VSVG-CHIKV-infected cells expressed an additional protein with the mobility expected for CHIKV E1 protein (52 kDa) the p62 protein runs just ahead of and overlapping VSV G and cannot be discerned clearly. rwt-VSV and VSVG-CHIKV particles contained the five indicated VSV proteins. VSVG-CHIKV particles contained a single extra protein band. the precursor protein p62 present in cells was absent from the VSVG-CHIKV virions. a single i.m. immunization (106 PFU) with these VSV/CHIKV recombinants induced antibodies that neutralized a VSVG-eGFP1/CHIKV pseudotype. a single i.m. immunization (106 PFU) with these VSV/CHIKV recombinants induced antibodies that neutralized a VSVG-eGFP1/CHIKV pseudotype. UV inactivation completely eliminated the antibody response to VSVG-CHIKV. this result indicates that proteins on incoming virions are not sufficient to generate the immune response. the noncomplemented VSVG-CHIKV would have the major advantage of not inducing anti-G antibodies. rwt-VSV-CHIKV induced a superior response at dilutions greater than 1:160. however, the differences between the two vaccine groups did not reach statistical significance. control rwt-VSV-immunized mice had no CHIKV nAb. rwt-VSV immunization was used as a control. rwt-VSV immunization was used as a control. all assays were performed in duplicate. rwt-VSV/CHIKV-immunized mice showed substantial footpad swelling. none of the rwt-VSV-immunized mice had detectible viremia. CHIKV-induced disease was monitored for 10 days postchallenge. the graph represents average percent prechallenge body weight in each group over time. the brain, lung, heart, kidney, bowel, spleen, and muscle showed no significant histopathologic differences. the brain, lung, heart, kidney, bowel, spleen, and muscle showed no significant histopathologic differences. VSV-based vaccine vectors are known to be potent inducers of both humoral and cellular immune responses. we also looked at the CHIKV-specific cellular immune response to the VSV/CHIKV vectors. CD8+ epitopes for 24 h followed by detection of IFN- spot-forming cells. asterisk indicates a significant difference (P 0.01, ANOVA) between VSV-CHIKV and VSVG-CHIKV groups in response to E2 peptide. a synthetic gene encoding the CHIKV E3-E2-6K-E1 polyprotein was inserted between the G and L genes of VSV (Indiana) in the plasmid the gene order is shown in the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 direction on the negative-sense RNA genome. expression of CHIKV envelope proteins detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-VSV G MAb or anti-CHIKV mouse serum in infected cells. rwt-VSV- and VSVG-CHIKV-infected cells expressed an additional protein with the mobility expected for CHIKV E1 protein (52 kDa) the p62 protein runs just ahead of and overlapping VSV G and cannot be discerned clearly. rwt-VSV and VSVG-CHIKV particles contained the five indicated VSV proteins. VSVG-CHIKV particles contained a single extra protein band. the precursor protein p62 present in cells was absent from the VSVG-CHIKV virions. the plaques generated by VSV-CHIKV are indistinguishable from VSV plaques. the plaques generated by VSV-CHIKV are indistinguishable from VSV plaques. the immune response requires viral RNA synthesis to determine if the nAb response to VSVG-CHIKV was dependent on viral replication. UV inactivation completely eliminated the antibody response to VSVG-CHIKV. this result indicates that proteins on incoming virions are not sufficient to generate the immune response. we performed a more detailed analysis of this virus and VSV-CHIKV. rwt-VSV-CHIKV induced a superior response at dilutions greater than 1:160. however, the differences between the two vaccine groups did not reach statistical significance. control rwt-VSV-immunized mice had no CHIKV nAb. rwt-VSV immunization was used as a control. rwt-VSV immunization was used as a control. control animals that received rwt-VSV showed viremia during the first 2 days after challenge. none of the rwt-VSV/CHIKV-vaccinated mice had detectible viremia. CHIKV-induced disease was monitored for 10 days postchallenge. four mice from each immunization group were bled on alternate days postchallenge or on days 2 and 4 postchallenge. values in parentheses indicate the number of positive mice/total number of mice in group. the graph represents average percent prechallenge body weight in each group over time. VSV/CHIKV recombinants induce cellular immune responses in mice. we also looked at the CHIKV-specific cellular immune response to the VSV/CHIKV vectors. VSVG-CHIKV recombinant incorporated functional CHIKV envelope proteins into the viral envelope and propagated in the absence of VSV G complementation. stronger antibody responses probably resulted from a combination of greater expression of CHIKV glycoproteins in the absence of VSV G. a single dose of VSVG-CHIKV recombinants induced potent CD8 T-cell responses to dominant epitopes in CHIKV proteins. a major advantage of the VSVG vector system is that it does not induce any antivector nAb since it lacks the VSV G protein. VSVG-CHIKV chimeric virus grew more slowly than wild-type VSV. the VSVG-CHIKV recombinant grows in vero cells to titers equivalent to those obtained in BHK-21 cells. this is important because vero cells are an approved cell line for vaccine production. VSV-based vaccine vectors given by the i.m. route cause no pathogenesis in mice."}
