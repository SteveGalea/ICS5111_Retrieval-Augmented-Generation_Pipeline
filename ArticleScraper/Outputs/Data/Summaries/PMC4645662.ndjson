{"summary": "fidelity determinants within the viral polymerase of many RNA viruses have been identified, including foot-and-mouth disease virus (1, 2), poliovirus (3, 4), coxsackie B virus (5, 6), influenza A virus (7), human enterovirus 71 (8, 9), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (10, 11), and Sindbis virus (SINV) (11) Mutagenic compounds such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil nsP1 contributes to membrane binding, capping events since the viral guanylyl- and methyltransferase. nsP2 is also required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. nsP3 harbors macrodomains, zinc binding domains, and a hypervariable region. the high-fidelity variants were resistant to other nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and brequinar. these data provide a novel role for nsP2 in regulating alphavirus fidelity and expand our knowledge on other viral components required to regulate these processes. RNAs were then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. they were quantified, diluted to 1 g/l, and stored at 80\u00b0C. each virus sample was passaged once over a 70 to 80% confluent monolayer of BHK-21. a 96-well tissue culture plate was plated for each virus with 104 Vero cells/well. each dilution was distributed in a row of the 96-well plate. the cells were fixed with 50 l of 4% formalin, the medium was removed and 50 l of crystal violet was added. mutation frequencies were estimated by molecular cloning. mutants were electroporated in tandem into BHK-21 cells. supernatants were collected 48 h later, and viral RNA was extracted.

UT, no enzyme control. fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based substrate representing the CHIKV nsP3/4 cleavage site was commercially purchased from GeneScript, USA. the peptide substrate was chemically linked to the FRET pair 4-[[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-azo] benzoic acid (DABCYL) and 5-[2\u2032-aminoethyl]-amino] naphthelenesulfonic acid reaction mixtures were preincubated for 15 min at 22\u00b0C. each reaction mixture was incubated with or without ATP-Mg2+ (3.5 mM, final concentration) at 30\u00b0C. reactions were stopped and processed further as described previously (21) images were quantified using ImageJ. NTPase assays. 5 mM creatine phosphate, 25 g and creatine phosphokinase/ml, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 1 mM CTP, 50 M UTP, 10 Ci of [-32P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer), and 1 l of RNaseOUT. RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Illustra microSpin S200 HR columns all newly generated DNA plasmids were sequenced in full (GATC Biotech) to confirm mutagenesis. cDNAs of CHIKV and SINV infectious clones were linearized with NotI or XhoI. RNAs were then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, quantified, diluted to 1 g/l. the cells were inoculated with virus in DMEM at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. each virus sample was passaged once over a 70 to 80% confluent monolayer of BHK-21 cells. titers were determined to ensure mutation stability and no second-site mutation. each dilution was distributed in a row of the 96-well plate. each well received 100 l of diluted virus. cells were fixed with 50 l of 4% formalin, the medium was removed. cDNA libraries were prepared using Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from RNA extracted from virus generated and passaged three times in BHK-21 cells. the viral genome was amplified by using a high-fidelity polymerase (Phusion) to generate one amplicon spanning the majority of the CHIKV genome. CHIKV cells were infected with wild-type CHIKV of the nsP2 G641D variant at an MOI of 10 in infection medium comprised of Glasgow minimum essential medim, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. after this incubation, the cells were washed twice in PBS, and complete medium was added. the medium was replaced with starvation medium containing 50 Ci of [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture (Perkin-Elmer) at times 0, 15, and 45 min postchase, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for immunoprecipitation, clarified lysate was diluted into NET 150 buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 BHK-21 cells were infected with wild-type CHIKV, nsP4 C483Y, nsP2 G641D. the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 g for 5 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl) and incubated overnight with antibodies to nsP1, nsP2, or nsP4. membranes were washed extensively in TBST, incubated in secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-antibody ( purified wild-type (WT) or nsP2 nsP2 enzymes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. the samples were flash frozen and stored at 80\u00b0C. nsP2 nsP2 cleavage assays were carried out using a protease assay. the fluorogenic reactions were constituted in triplicates in a final volume of 200 l (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.2] and 2 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] at a final volume of 8 l. samples were boiled and resolved on a SDS\u201310% PAGE gel. RNA oligonucleotide substrates with 5\u2032 overhang for helicase assays were prepared as described previously (21) for helicase assays, a 50 pM concentration of RNA substrate was incubated with 12.5 nM purified WT nsP2 or the nsP2 G641D variant in reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mM DTT, and 10 mM NaC 40 l of 1 mM nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate was added to a reaction mixture. reactions were performed as described above but with ATP, CTP, and GTP concentrations of 10 or 100 M. RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and separated on a 1% TAE agarose gel. nsP2 is involved in regulating CHIKV genome fidelity. this variant manifested increased fidelity in every cell type. nsP4 (C483Y) and nsP2 (G641D) variants were isolated in same antiviral treatment. mutations of wild-type (WT) and nsP2 (G641D) viruses in mammalian cells regulate virus fidelity. nsP2 fidelity-increasing mutation could compensate for low-fidelity activity of a mutator variant of the nsP4 polymerase. a protein alignment of the alphavirus nsP2 revealed that CHIKV and a close relative, O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) also contain a glycine at this corresponding position, whereas other alphaviruses contain a glutamic acid. we hypothesized that there is an essential requirement for a negative charge at this position for maintaining fidelity. new tab Regulation of virus fidelity by nsP2 is conserved among alphaviruses. nsP2 functions as the viral protease early during infection. nsP2 functions as a helicase and NTPase. we purified nsP2 and the G641D variant. no difference in protein purity or protein folding by circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis. at 3 h postinfection, cells were starved in methionine-cysteine-free medium. then pulsed with 50 Ci of [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 15 min. synthesized nonstructural polyproteins, their processing intermediates, and mature nsPs were immunoprecipitated. purified proteins were incubated with dsRNA subtract for 1 h. nsP2 5A-PG was used as a negative control. aliquots were removed at indicated time points. CHIKV high-fidelity replication complexes have increased in vitro RNA polymerase activity and are less sensitive to nucleotide depletion. nsP4 and nsP2 may reduce their replicase activity to become more selective to nucleotide pools and replicate more efficiently even at low nucleotide concentrations. CHIKV high-fidelity replicase variants confer resistance to nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors. the nsP2 and nsP4 variants were selected in the presence of ribavirin. uridine was unable to rescue viral growth to the extent of guanosine. brequinar is a compound that acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. brequinar is a compound that acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. brequinar is a compound that acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. the addition of this variant to nsP2 G641D did not further enhance the resistance of the single nsP2 mutation, suggesting that nsP2 and nsP4 may function independently under these conditions. the addition of irrelevant nucleosides was not effective for restoring viral growth, confirming that nucleotide depletion was leading to viral attenuation. the alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 regulates genome replication fidelity. the wild-type population was mutagenized by the drug to the greatest degree. the higher-fidelity nsP4 variant resisted mutagenesis, as previously reported (10) the nsP2 and nsP4 double mutant completely resisted the mutagenic activity of ribavirin. mutator nsp4 C483G, and nsp2 G641D-nsp4 C483G variants. nsP2 fidelity-increasing mutation could compensate for low-fidelity activity of a mutator variant of the nsP4 polymerase. to analyze this, we took advantage of a previously identified nsP4 variant that has an increased mutation frequency. a glutamic acid at position 641 of CHIKV observed a decrease in mutation frequency similar to the G641D variant. in a previous study, we had observed that SINV maintained a lower basal mutation frequency (higher native fidelity) than CHIKV (11) high-fidelity CHIKV variants have increased in vitro replicase activity. nsP2 functions as the viral protease early during infection. nsP2 functions as the viral protease early during infection. chikungunya virus nsP2 high-fidelity variant does not alter viral growth or polyprotein processing. at 3 h postinfection, the cells were starved in methionine-cysteine-free medium and then pulsed with 50 Ci of [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 15 min. nsP2 high-fidelity variant G641D exhibited increased NTPase activity in vitro. purified proteins were incubated with dsRNA subtract for 1 h. nsP2 5A-PG was used as a negative control. nsP2 G641D may play a role in the replication complex's ability to hydrolyze nucleotides. however, since other nonstructural proteins have not yet been successfully biochemically purified and tested in vitro, we could not test this further. CHIKV high-fidelity replication complexes have increased in vitro RNA polymerase activity and are less sensitive to nucleotide depletion. sP2 may reduce replicase activity to become more selective to nucleotide pools and replicate more efficiently even at low concentrations. CHIKV high-fidelity variants are resistant to nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors. Viruses were grown in the presence of 200 M ribavirin. either left untreated (no exogenous nucleosides) or complemented with 30 g of guanosine/ml or 20 g of uracil/ml. mycophenolic acid inhibits IMPDH, acting analogously to ribavirin. brequinar acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, depleting both CTP and TTP. by treating cells during viral infection with each compound, we found that high-fidelity variants were more resistant to both nucleotide-depleting compounds. in a previous study, we uncovered a variant of the helicase/protease (nsp2 G641D) and a high-fidelity polymerase variant (C483Y) (10) this variant increased the fidelity of CHIKV in multiple cell types, providing a novel role for the nsP2 protein in the viral life cycle. this could be due to changes in physical interactions between nsP2 and nsP4. the nsP2 variant confers resistance to ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil. the addition of the nsP4 high-fidelity polymerase variant further increased resistance to these mutagens. this was highlighted by the additive increase in fidelity of the double mutant containing a high-fidelity polymerase. mutator variants for other alphaviruses could be easily obtained. nsP2 high-fidelity variant was changing mutation frequency. mutator strains could provide novel therapeutic vaccine strategies. a combination of nsP2 641D and 483Y yields a complex that is largely unable to acquire ribavirin. however, this system is robust and sufficient for studying purified nsP2. this is lacking all other components of the replication complex, which have yet to be successfully expressed in vitro. fidelity is not only regulated at nucleotide access but at multiple levels, including RNA structure, replicase protein-protein interactions and processivity. high-fidelity replication complex activity was reduced to a greater extent than wild type. nsP2 G641D variant conferred resistance to brequinar and pyrimidine depletion. nsP2 may be more effective RNA mutagens only when natural nucleotide pools are concomitantly depleted. this is supported by the ability to complement mutagenic effect of ribavirin and mycophenolic acid with the addition of relevant nucleosides."}
