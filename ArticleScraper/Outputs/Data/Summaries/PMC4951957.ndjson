{"summary": "the importance of ethics is noted in passing and values are mentioned several times in the report. there is no discussion of the type of ethics education relevant to 21st century healthcare. it is precisely the values that the best physicians exemplify in practice that create the ground for their authority and legitimacy. traditional concepts of medical ethics, centred on standards of professional competence and conduct, are broadly outlined by formal codes of practice. these attributes go beyond the ideas of mere competence and duties of healthcare outlined in the Physician Charter's \u2018basic professionalism\u2019 to embrace a \u2018higher professionalism\u2019 underpinned by considerations of excellence and virtue. es Virtue theory focuses on the ideal traits of character that can be aspired to, encouraged and developed in life generally, and in medical education and practice specifically. these traits encompass both the cognitive/intellectual abilities (rigor and objectivity) and the ethical attributes of physicians (honesty, compassion, temperance) which derive from the habits of working practically and self-reflectively within one's professional field. dedication to achieving excellence provides internal satisfaction for professionals. these desirable, integrated, professional virtues are in the process of attrition because of excessive reliance on and indiscriminate use of technology in medical care that is superspecialised, fragmented, depersonalised and commodified. 'reliabilist' virtues relate to cognitive skills of a clinician in terms of the intellectual function and capacity to obtain relevant and appropriate knowledge in clinical care.'responsibilist' virtues characterised by intellectual curiosity, courage, honesty and humility. the challenges of changing medical education should be associated with serious attempts to change the practice environment. both tasks could improve the effectiveness of clinicians as agents of change in the personal lives of individual patients and within nations, to enhance equity and reduce healthcare costs. public health ethics is concerned with examining the tension between collective and individual goods. this is not sufficient for the achievement of improved public health, as revealed from insights gleaned from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic. cosmopolitanism has evolved over the centuries, but a common theme is that humans have affiliations with each other regardless of nation of birth, identity, family relationships, or political and religious allegiances. a cosmopolitan virtues (tolerance, curiosity, epistemic humility and generosity) help illuminate the types of qualities and characteristics of a global health citizen. the magnitude of the mindset shift required to move from hyperindividualism to individualism within community should be neither underestimated nor undervalued. an ambitious programme would require the funding of multidisciplinary research and knowledge translation through a new series of grand challenges. potential effectiveness of the grand challenges\u2019 approach to scientific technical issues in medicine could be fruitfully emulate in the realm of the structure of social forces that affect population health. there must be an explicit account of the virtues and values that will inform healthcare practice in the 21st century. a renewed emphasis is needed on reviving the well-honed clinical skills and humanistic attributes in medicine as crucial for optimum affordable (and sustainable) care of individual patients. good examples, shown by established clinicians and teachers at the bedside and by leaders who set institutional and national policies, could inspire emulation by new generations."}
