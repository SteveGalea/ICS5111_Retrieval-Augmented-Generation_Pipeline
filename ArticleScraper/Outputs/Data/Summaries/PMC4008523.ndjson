{"summary": "in recent years, newly emerging diseases have been identified with an unprecedented rate of one or more per year[1]. highly developed transportation systems have intensified the spreading trend of the epidemics thus highlights the urgent demand for the research on effective control strategies. studies have shown that deterministic immunization strategies regularly outperform stochastic immunization strategies in controlling the epidemics[16] the realistic global network information is usually or even constantly unavailable in the infectious diseases control practice. however, the real effectiveness assessment of the stochastic immunization strategies mentioned above is almost entirely made based on classical network models. the nodes and edges attributes of the social contact network were listed in Table 1. the link between each pair of nodes recorded the contact type of the two nodes. the nodes and edges attributes of the contact network were listed in Table 1. individuals in class V and R will acquire fully immunity to the diseases. individuals in class D will be isolated and lose the capability to infect others. the self-loop transition have been omitted. AI strategy is defined as follows: first, selecting n random nodes from the network; second, for each chosen node, immunizing a random neighbor. a node with k connections will be targeted as the immunization node with the probability [15], where is the average degree. for any susceptible individual, it will enter into the controlled set and proceed to class V with the probability (second-order detection) node will enter into the controlled set with probability and proceed to class D. for individuals in other states, no other processing is required. the dynamics of this probability is governed by the following master equations. a susceptible individual (S) suffers from an instantaneous infection rate at time t, where if j is in state I, otherwise 0. Alternatively, infectious individuals could be directly detected at probability r. the interventions will dominate the probability of susceptible individuals proceeding to class V. AI and CBI are epidemic-triggered and global controlled strategies. for RV, the interventions are implemented by tracing contacts to detected nodes (D) and immunizing the traced nodes. a node will be targeted as the community-bridge node under the community-bridge find algorithm[16] with the probability q. the process of the targeted nodes is the same as it in AI, so it will not be repeated. class I individual will enter into controlled set and proceed to class D with the probability (second-order detection) for each infectious node, it will enter into the controlled set with probability and proceed to class D with the total probability. for individuals in other states, no processing was made. 50 infectious individuals are seeded in the fully susceptible population. the fraction of class I individuals in the population is about 3.12 per 100000. only infectious diseases with could possibly lead to a potential outbreak. contact trace lag ranges from 1.0 to 3.0 r 0.6 0.3\u20130.9 In each day the probability of an infectious individual is detected. each contact is represented by an undirected weighted link, where the weight denotes the contact duration in hours. the average degree is, which is more than the precedent empirical results from questionnaire survey[30]. the binary search method was adopted to explore the optimal immunization ratio in interval [0, 1]. the search process ends when search step. the immunization ratio f for AI could be any value between 0 and 1: f = 0 indicates no interventions. the success of RV depends on several crucial factors, such as the rapid identification of cases and the efficient contact trace of the identified cases. for close contacts, assume that the contact escape rate and the time lag in tracing for the contacts of type i, denoted by. effectiveness comparison and sensitivity analysis The effectiveness of AI, CBI and RV in controlling the spread of infectious diseases has been compared. all three immunization strategies were demonstrated to have successfully decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to the scenario with no control measures (no control measures) in Figure 5a. the contour lines of the fraction of susceptible individuals for AI and CBI decrease with the increase of r. both of the contour lines of the fraction of susceptible individuals for AI and CBI slope upwards, indicating that the coverage of the epidemics decrease with the increase of r. the effectiveness of AI, CBI and RV for ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 was analyzed. for RV, the declining rate of the contour lines decreases, indicating the number of susceptible individuals decreases more slowly. the decrease of susceptible individuals for RV is significantly slower than for AI and CBI, i.e., notably outperforms AI and CBI. sensitivity analysis was chosen to parameterize our model for the baseline scenario in this research. the scenarios when varies from 2.0 to 6.0 were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis. the value of the parameters in the model doesn't affect the epidemic dynamic. the report of the respondents might miss some regular contacts and most random contacts. the average clustering coefficient[18] is and the modularity[31] is. high heterogeneity was observed when taking the individual contact frequency into consideration. node 1 and 5 are community-bridge nodes, i.e., potential immunization targets. node 2, 3 and 4 are impossible to be targeted as immunization nodes. the realistic immunization ratio will always be less than. for close contacts, i.e., contacts in household, school and workplace assume that the contact escape rate and the time lag are 0, that is, all close contacts could be traced and the immunization could be carried out immediately. the values of the parameters and related statements are listed in Table 2. similar analytics could be applied to other pair strategies (CBI \u2013 AI), (RV \u2013 CBI) and (RV \u2013 AI) similar analytics could be applied to other pair strategies (CBI \u2013 AI) the contour lines of the fraction of susceptible individuals with respect to time steps with r ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 for (a) AI, (b) CBI and (c) CBI \u2013 AI; (d) the optimal immunization ratios of AI and CBI with respect to different r. the effectiveness of RV is greatly denominated by r, q and. the decrease of susceptible individuals for RV is significantly slower than for AI and CBI, i.e., RV notably outperforms AI and CBI on equal terms. sensitivity analysis shows the effectiveness of RV decrease with the decrease of case detection rate. RV is a newly confirmed case-triggered and locally controlled strategy. AI and CBI are epidemic-triggered and global controlled strategies. the global control strategies might encounter the resistance of the public."}
