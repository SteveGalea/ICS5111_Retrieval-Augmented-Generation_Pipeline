{"summary": "HRSV is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children (23) and causes repeated infections throughout life. the severity of illness varies from bronchiolitis to common cold-like symptoms. one pathologies of the disease is an innate inflammatory response to infection in the lung. NS1 has been shown to be the most abundantly produced protein of those viral proteins detected in a quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of a549 cells infected with either HRSV subgroup A or HRSV subgroup B isolates. stability of NS1 and NS2 may also be linked to viral pathogenesis (44), with NS2 being reported to be more rapidly degraded than NS1 (17, 21) three cellular proteins, including cullin-2, elongin C (17), and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) (45), have been identified to directly bind to NS1. NS1 has also been reported to interact with other HRSV proteins, including NS2 (45), matrix protein (21), and phosphoprotein (25) a high-affinity purification approach coupled to a mass spectrometry-based approach was used. NS1 and NS2 cDNA sequences were cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) downstream of the enhanced GFP-coding sequence. expression of both fusion proteins was confirmed by sequence analysis. cells were grown in DMEM growth medium containing light (R0K0), medium (R6K4), or heavy (R10K8) arginine and lysine isotopes. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysed. EGFP, EGFP-NS1 and EGFP-NS2 immunoprecipitated using a GFP trap. the bead pellet was washed once with dilution buffer, followed by a single wash stage in buffer comprising 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor. the beads were resuspended in 2 SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 10 min to elute bound proteins. Tandem mass spectra were acquired using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur (version 2.0) software. the top six multiply charged ions in each duty cycle were selected for MS/MS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.8 Da. search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) the data on EGFP-NS1 were deposited into the IntAct database. each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (IPKB) each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object. 293T cells were grown in stable isotope-labeled Eagle's medium (DMEM; Dundee Cell Products) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Dundee Cell Products) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO2. cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 30 min. four 10-cm2 dishes were seeded with 1.25 106 cells each 24 h prior to calcium phosphate transfection. cells were harvested and lysed, and EGFP (light label), EGFP-NS1 (medium label), and EGFP-NS2 (heavy label) were immunoprecipitated using a GFP trap. peptides in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nanotrap column (Dionex) after washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on an organic gradient. peptides were ionized by nano-electrospray ionization at 2.3 kV using a stainless steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 m (Proxeon) and a capillary temperature of 250\u00b0C. the top six multiply charged ions in each duty cycle were selected for MS/MS. the reverse database search option was enabled, and all peptide data were filtered to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. the minimum cross-correlation factor filter was readjusted for each individual charge state separately to optimally meet the predetermined target FDR of 5%. networks were generated using data sets containing gene identifiers and expression values. each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IPKB. an enrichment ratio was set to identify genes of proteins associated with EGFP-NS1 compared to those associated with EGFP. 293T cells were chosen for a number of reasons. a SILAC labeling approach was used in cells expressing either EGFP-NS1 or, as binding controls, EGFP or EGFP-NS2. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP, EGFP-NS1 and EGFP-NS2. expression was confirmed using confocal microscopy. cDNAs were amplified by PCR and inserted into expression plasmid downstream of the EGFP-coding sequence. EGFP, EGFP-NS1 and EGFP-NS2 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. this finding was similar to that reported for native NS1 in a proteomic analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts purified from HRSV-infected cells. the modal ratio was approximately 2-fold for EGFP-NS1 (excluding ratio hits set at 100) work by ourselves and others has suggested that this modal value can represent a threshold for nonspecific interactions that arise due to binding to either the agarose bead matrix or the single-chain GFP-antibody component of the GFP trap.

Western blot analysis performed control immunoprecipitations using both uncoupled agarose beads and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) trap. cyclin C, Med8, Pol II, and ATR were immunoprecipitated by the LC-MS/MS analysis. the selected proteins were chosen in part due to their identification in the LC-MS/MS analysis. cell lysate components were immunoprecipitated using unconjugated agarose beads, an RFP trap, or a GFP trap. immunoprecipitates were then probed for the presence of the cellular proteins cyclin C, MED8, Pol II, ATR, Hsp70, and vimentin. EGFP-NS1 was found with complexes containing 19 proteins associated with cell cycle regulation. flow cytometry using DAPI to stain DNA at 48 h posttransfection of 293T cells expressing EGFP-NS1 compared to that for the controls. cells were treated with nocodazole, a mitotic inhibitor, to deplete the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and highlight any specific G1-phase-arrest cells. data from three replicate experiments were analyzed using Student's t test (*, P 0.05) to investigate this further, cell cycle profiles were analyzed in A549 cells either mock infected or infected with either recombinant wild-type HRSV (rA2) or recombinant viruses. similar G0/G1 cell cycle profiles were obtained for mock-infected cells and cells infected with either rA2 or NS1/2. 293T cells were grown in either light (R0K0), medium (R6K4), or heavy (R10K8) SILAC medium. each cellular protein incorporated isotopically distinguishable arginine and lysine prior to transfection. expression of EGFP, EGFP-NS1 and EGFP-NS2 in 293T cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. expression of EGFP, EGFP-NS1 and EGFP-NS2 in 293T cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. the binding data for EGFP-NS2 are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. the raw data for the entire study were uploaded onto the PRIDE repository (52) using the PRIDE convertor tool (2). only this database was deposited with the protein interactome repository IntAct (27) and IMEx ID IM-15828. EGFP-NS1 protein immunoprecipitated sample identified by LC-MS/MS showed a ratio of relative expression level more than 1 log2-fold compared to identical proteins with light labeling from the EGFP immunoprecipitated samplea. this value was used to select proteins for bioinformatic analysis and further validation of nonspecific and specific interactions using nonlabeled biological replicates.

EGFP-NS1-interacting proteins were distinguished as belonging to enzyme, cellular transporter, and transcription regulators. these proteins were further defined using the core analysis function of IPA software. NS1 was highlighted as playing a potential role in modulating host cell transcription through interaction with the mediator complex and the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme. cipitates from cells expressing the EGFP-NS1 showed a 1-log2-unit increase in abundance in immunoprecipitates compared to immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the EGFP-NS1. western blot analysis showed that the GFP trap specifically immunoprecipitated. cyclin C, MED8, Pol II, and vimentin were not selectively immunoprecipitated by the GFP trap. agarose bead controls did not bind to EGFP-NS1 suggesting a specific association with EGFP-NS1. aTR and ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) activate the DNA damage checkpoint. this leads to cell cycle arrest through either p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 signaling or Chk1-cdc25c signaling, for example, through inhibitory effects on CDK4. previous work has shown that HRSV infection can induce enrichment of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. expression of EGFP-NS1 resulted in a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in 293T cells. cells mock transfected or expressing EGFP, EGFP-NS1 or EGFP-NS2 in absence (A) or presence (B) of nocodozole. a total of 221 unique cellular proteins were identified as being enriched 2-fold or more in binding to EGFP-NS1 over EGFP. the potential accuracy of this data set could be further improved using SILAC-based approaches optimized for identifying low-affinity and transient interactions. NS1 was found to interact with cellular proteins involved in the transcription of class II genes, including cyclin C, mediator complex, and RNA polymerase II. mediator complex functions as a transcriptional coactivator which binds to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and acts as a bridge between transcription factors and Pol II. infection of cells with recombinant HRSV deficient in the expression of NS1 resulted in no observable differences in the cell cycle compared to mock-infected controls. if this effect is mediated directly through interaction with cell cycle regulatory factors or may be due to indirect effects such as changes in the abundance of STAT1 (15)"}
