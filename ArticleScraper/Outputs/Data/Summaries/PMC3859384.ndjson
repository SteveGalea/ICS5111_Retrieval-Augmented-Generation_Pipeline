{"summary": "angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a homolog of ACE. ACE2 is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) thereby counterbalancing ACE activity (13\u201315) ACE2 cleaves off the C terminus amino acid phenylalanine of the apelin peptide in vitro. the functional interplay between apelin and ACE2 remained, however, elusive. we report that ACE2 expression is downregulated in mice. ACE2 activity in apelin\u2013/y mice was measured by cleavage of fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, Mca-APK-(Dnp) with ACE2-knockout (Ace2\u2013/y) mice serving as background controls. no changes in Ang II peptide levels in apelin\u2013/y mice. plasma ACE2 activity was significantly reduced in apelin\u2013/y mice. expression of other enzymes suggested to regulate Ang 1-7 formation were not altered. loss of apelin results in downregulation of ACE2 expression. inactivation of AT1 receptors on an apelin knockout background (Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013;apelin\u2013/y mice) also rescued the decreased fractional shortening (FS) and upregulated heart failure genes of aged apelin\u2013/y mice. d apelin\u2013/y mice to transverse aortic constriction were significantly impaired after 8 weeks of TAC. genetic inactivation of AT1R in mice rescued impaired heart function. increased heart weight and marked fibrosis of apelin\u2013/y mice following TAC were significantly decreased in mice. mRNA expression was significantly upregulated compared with control apelin\u2013/y mice. loss of AT1R resulted in increased ACE2 expression levels in apelin\u2013/y mice. ang 1-7 rescues cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy in apelin\u2013/y mice. ang 1-7 infusions reversed enhanced hypertrophy of apelin\u2013/y mice with TAC to those of wild-type mice. increased expression of the Ang 1-7 receptor Mas was restored to wild-type levels. ang 1-7 rescues impaired heart function in apelin\u2013/y mice. apelin-APJ induces ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. ACE2 staining was detected in cardiomyocytes. endothelial cells expressed lower levels of ACE2 protein. luciferase reporter plasmids ACE2 (\u20131119/+103)-luc, ACE2 (\u2013252/+103)-luc, ACE2 (\u2013202/+103)-luc, or ACE2 (\u2013230/+1)-luc in combination with APJ expression vectors in vero E6 cells. n = 3 per group in at least 2 independent experiments. ACE2 (\u20131119/+103)-luc, ACE2 (\u2013252/+103)-luc, but not ACE2 (\u2013202/+103)-luc constructs showed modest induction of ACE2 promoter activity. ACE2 (\u2013252/+103) promoter activity was dependent on expression of the APJ receptor. apelin-13 treatment improved heart functions and reduced heart weight. impaired heart functions as well as increased heart weights of Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013 mice under TAC were also improved by continuous infusion of apelin-13 peptide. western blot for ACE2 in total protein lysates from hearts of Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013 mice treated with vehicle and apelin-13 under TAC. all values represent mean SEM. *P 0.05; **P 0.01. Downregulation of ACE2 in apelin-deficient hearts. values were normalized to 18S RNA (n = 8 per group) and are shown as mean AU. Western blot for ACE2 in the hearts of apelin\u2013/y and wild-type mice. phenotypes of ACE2-knockout mice can be rescued by RAS inhibition (16, 17) we treated aged apelin\u2013/y mice (1 year old) with an AT1 receptor blocker. after 6 weeks of ARB treatment, the impaired heart function of apelin\u2013/y mice was markedly improved. echocardiography images (D), measurements of percentage of FS (E) and LVESD (F) of wild-type, apelin\u2013/y, Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013, and Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013;apelin\u2013/y mice after 8 weeks of TAC. genetic inactivation of AT1 receptors on an apelin knockout background (Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013;apelin\u2013/y mice) also rescued the decreased fractional shortening 1a\u2013/\u2013;apelin\u2013/y mice rescued impaired heart function. increased heart weight and marked fibrosis were significantly decreased. elevated expression of heart failure\u2013associated (BNP, ANF, MHC) and fibrotic (TGF2) genes in apelin\u2013/y mice with TAC were downregulated to levels of control wild-type mice. plasma ACE2 activity was significantly elevated in Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013 mice. so, genetic inactivation of AT1R results in upregulation of ACE2 expression in apelin\u2013/y mice. ang 1-7 rescues cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy in apelin\u2013/y mice. Ang 1-7 infusions reversed the enhanced hypertrophy of apelin\u2013/y mice with TAC to those of wild-type mice. elevated expression of heart failure\u2013associated genes (BNP, MHC, Periostin) in apelin\u2013/y mice was restored to wild-type levels. apelin-APJ induces ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. ACE2 protein levels were significantly upregulated in the myocardium. ACE2 expression was not induced in coronary artery endothelial cells in vitro. luciferase reporter plasmids ACE2 (\u20131119/+103)-luc, ACE2 (\u2013252/+103)-luc, ACE2 (\u2013230/+1)-luc, or ACE2 (-230/+1)-luc. cells were either left untreated or treated with 1 M apelin-13 peptide (apelin-13) apelin dose dependently increased ACE2 (\u2013252/+103) promoter activity. activation of ACE2 promoter was also observed in HEK293T cells. ACE2 promoter activity was dependent on expression of the APJ receptor. apelin-13 treatment resulted in downregulated expression of the MHC gene in Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013 mice as well as in wild-type mice. therefore, apelin-13 exerts cardioprotective effects in Agtr1a\u2013/\u2013 mice with TAC. Ang 1-7 peptide treatment rescued the cardiac dysfunction in apelin mutant mice. apelin-APJ signaling has previously been shown to counteract the effects of Ang II on AT1 receptors. ang 1-7 signaling and its positive effect on Mas expression is suppressed in apelin\u2013/y mice. ACE2 promoter is activated in epicardial cells in Xenopus embryos via a GATA-binding site (39) the ACE2 promoter region is conserved among species (39) ACE2 and apelin exhibit beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system. recombinant ACE2 protein has recently been shown as a candidate therapeutic for treating heart failure in animal models. wild-type and apelin\u2013/y male mice were subcutaneously infused with either saline or Ang 1-7 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks by osmotic minipumps. two weeks after treatment, echocardiography was performed and mice sacrificed for analysis. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1%)/oxygen. echocardiography was performed using a 30-MHz linear transducer. the heart was first imaged in 2D mode in the parasternal short-axis view. cDNA synthesized using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and cDNA synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TAKARA). real-time PCR was run in 96-well plates using a SYBR Premix ExTaq II (TAKARA). TECAN plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 390 nm. luciferase activity was measured using the GloMAX-Multi Detection System (Promega) cardiomyocytes were cultured in 24-well plates, treated with 1 M apelin. protein samples were extracted as described for Western blotting. data not normally distributed were analyzed by an unpaired 2-tailed t test. wild-type and apelin\u2013/y male mice were subcutaneously infused with either saline or Ang 1-7 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks by osmotic minipumps. two weeks after treatment, echocardiography was performed and mice were sacrificed for analysis. FS was calculated as follows: FS = [(LVEDD \u2013 LVESD)/LVEDD] 100, where LVEDD indicates LD end-diastolic diameter and LVESD indicates LV end-systolic diameter. the heart was first imaged in 2D mode in the parasternal short-axis view. time PCR was run in 96-well plates using a SYBR Premix ExTaq II.
