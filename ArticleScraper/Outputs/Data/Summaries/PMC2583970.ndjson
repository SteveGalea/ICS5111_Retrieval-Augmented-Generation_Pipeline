{"summary": "cotton blue disease (CBD) is an important global cotton crop pathology responsible for major economic losses. symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. CBD is a serious crop problem capable of reducing productivity by up to 80% if intensive insecticidal control is not properly performed during the growing season. in brazil, the disease is associated with a virus from the family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus, named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) the genetic variability of plant viral populations is an important aspect of their evolution and epidemiology [13]. to better understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties from five of the six most important cotton-growing states of the country.

RT-PCR products were purified using the Wizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-UP System (Promega) to amplify the full-length fragment corresponding to the partial RdRp, IR, and CP regions. amplicons of each viral fragment were purified and then directly sequenced in both directions. s virus (TYV) represents the species most closely related to CLRDV across the polymerase and coat protein sequences. sequences from members of the family Luteoviridae were used in the phylogenetic analyses. sequences obtained from individual PCRs were concatenated in silico. the identities were calculated in a sliding window of 120 bp. a 70% bootstrap support was considered to be definitive. at least three independent PCR reactions for each fragment from each sample were sequenced. the CP sequences of all isolates were similar to the CP sequence from CLRDV deposited in the GenBank database (accession number AY758560) most of the RdRp sequences analyzed were closely related to that of the previously reported isolate. two groups of CP phylogeny were found: a small cluster formed by isolates CV2 and PO1 (bootstrap of 96%) and a large cluster containing almost all of the other sampled isolates. PL3 appeared to be the most divergent isolate, since its CP sequence was not grouped with the others. isolates from DF (2005) and Primavera do Leste (2007) grouped together. the three divergent isolates were clearly separated from the other 20 CLDRV isolates found. differences were found between RdRp sequences from the divergent isolates and those from viruses associated with typical CBD symptoms. black boxes represent residues present in all viruses in the alignment. columns in the alignment with 100% but > 60% conservation are shaded in gray. sequences obtained were aligned with sequences of CLRDV and nine other randomly chosen isolates. ovirus members are distinguished with grey, orange, and blue circles. the partial RdRp sequence analyzed encodes the 92 C-terminal residues of the viral protein. significant identities were also found with TYV (68%) and BMYV (66%), and with TVDV (66%), an unclassified Luteoviridae that has a Polerovirus-like RdRp. a comparison of the RdRp sequences revealed that these three isolates had low sequence similarities to CLRDV and to the other 20 isolates. however, a pronounced increase in the similarities between PL3, CV2, and PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates was observed from the middle of the IR to the end of the CP sequence. a bootscan analysis was performed to identify possible parental lines for the divergent isolates. the bootstrap values were low until nt 435 and did not support clustering with CLRDV. similar plots were obtained for isolates CV2 and PL3. the horizontal axis represents the nucleotide distance of the midpoint of the window. the vertical axis represents the percentage of trees (using 100 bootstrap replicates) that support branching with the divergent isolate query sequence. trees constructed from partial RdRp (Figure 2B) and IR (data not shown) sequences were congruent and revealed a clear segregation of the isolates into two monophyletic clusters. this dichotomy was supported by 100% bootstraps in trees constructed either on nucleotide- or amino acid-based alignments. amplification of a single amplicon (1074 bp) corresponded to the partial RdRp, IR, and CP regions of isolates PO1, PL3 and CV2. black boxes represent residues present in all viruses in the alignment. arrow represents the break point indicated in the GARD analysis. LRDV in the Polerovirus branch of the tree, together with other definitive members of this group. the predicted amino acid sequences of the CP and (B) the C-terminal region of RdRp were aligned with Multalign and the trees were constructed with MEGA4. the sequences are distinguished with grey, orange, and blue circles. the recombination events could explain the emergence of the PL3, CV2, and PO1 isolates. a comparison of the RdRp sequences revealed that these three isolates had low sequence similarities to CLRDV and to the other 20 isolates. a pronounced increase in similarities between PL3, CV2, and PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates was observed from the middle of the IR to the end of the CP sequence. enated TYV nucleotide sequences indicated a clear breaking point at nucleotide (nt) 443. the proposed breakpoint-delimited phylogenetic tree revealed that the cluster formed by PL3, CV2 and PO1 was more divergent to CLRDV isolates. however, for a segment downstream of the breakpoint, the phylogeny showed a grouping of the clusters formed by the divergent and CLRDV isolates. bootstrap values were low until nt 435 and did not support clustering. for CP and nearby sequences, the bootstrap values supported the grouping of the divergent isolates with CLRDV. similar plots were obtained for isolates CV2 and PL3. we previously described a virus associated with CBD in brazil. this virus was present in CBD-symptomatic plants from a crop field in Primavera do Leste, MT. phylogenetic analysis of 23 new viral isolates showed a low diversity in the CP CLRDV gene. phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region revealed a clear segregation between PL3, CV2, and PO1 and the other CLRDV isolates identified in this study. the IR between the RdRp and CP sequences from divergent isolates have 187 nt, the same as that in CLRDV. subsequent recombination events have occurred between the genera Luteoviridae and Polerovirus [25] recombination sites in the family appear to coincide with the starting points for subgenomic RNA synthesis in the IR [7] recombination sites in the family appear to coincide with the starting points for subgenomic RNA synthesis in the IR. these isolates have a CLRDV-related coat protein but distinct RdRp sequences and probably arose from recombination events between CLRDV and unidentified luteovirus. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
