{"summary": "hematoma expansion is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. the 30-day mortality rate of ICH is 30\u201355% and only 12\u201339% of survivors have favorable functional outcomes after 6 months. hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor that causes poor outcomes and increasing mortality. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital (IRB No. 05-2019-111) all patients with neurological symptoms were routinely evaluated by neurosurgeons and admitted to our neurointensive care unit or neurosurgical unit. most of these diseases could be excluded by taking CT angiography or enhanced CT at the same time during their first CT. patients who did not receive tranexamic acid from October 2008 to January 2017 were compared with patients who were administered tranexamic acid. the target systolic BP was lower than 140 mmHg. systolic BP was monitored continuously through the arterial line. continuous variables are presented as meansstandard deviations. student's t-test, 2 analysis, and the Fisher's exact test were used to assess between-group differences. first CT was taken within 30 minutes of arrival to the emergency room. second CT was taken within 48 hours. hematoma size was measured in the initial and second CT images. systolic BP was monitored continuously through the arterial line. initial high BP was controlled by a diltiazem or nicardipine bolus intravenous injection. continuous intravenous administration of nicardipine was used in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. TABLE 1 shows the characteristics of patients who did and did not receive tranexamic acid. there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in mean age, sex, size and volume of hematoma. TABLE 2 compares the 2 groups who experienced hematoma expansion. the maximum diameter of the hematomas and the presence of spot sign were found as significant risk factors for hematoma expansion. hematoma expansion p-value Total No. of patients 284 45 Mean age in years 61.214.0 58.29.5 0.174 Female 166 (58.5) 30 (66.7) 0.297 Initial maximum diameter (mm) 31.914.6 38.612.2 0.004 Initial volume (cm3) 12.815.1 17.814.6 0.060 Systolic BP on initial evaluation (mmHg) 99.722.9 104.021.8 0.234 Hypertension 172 (60.6) 24 (5 hematoma volume and maximum diameter were 17.814.6 cm3, 38.612.2 mm in the hematoma expansion group and 31.914.6 mm, 12.815.1 cm3 in the non-hematoma expansion group respectively. the optimal cut points to achieve the maximum sensitivity and specificity of the maximum diameter and hematoma volume were 40.5 mm and 10.1 cm3, respectively. tranexamic acid has been used for decades for its ability to reduce intraoperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. tranexamic acid also passes through the blood-brain barrier and may be effective in hemorrhage diseases, including intracranial hemorrhages. the use of tranexamic acid in cardiac, orthopedic, and spinal deformity surgeries has shown reduced hemorrhage and intraoperative transfusion. the primary issue with the use of tranexamic acid is the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolic events. tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivation of the amino acid lysine. it serves as an antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding to 4 or 5 lysine receptor sites on plasminogen molecules. this binding blocks the interaction of plasmin and plasmin with lysine residues on the surface of fibrin. tranexamic acid reduces rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages. thromboembolic events or delayed cerebral ischemia also increases. recent systemic reviews have reported that the use of tranexamic acid in patients with nontraumatic SAH reduces mortality; however, this finding was not statistically significant. mic acid is the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. however recent literatures, including a meta-analysis, demonstrated that tranexamic acid was not associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events. a small number of cases and adjustable parameters, including BP and pain, were strictly managed according to the guidelines. the results of well-designed and randomized, controlled ongoing clinical trials will prove the value of our findings."}
