{"summary": "morphologies produced vary by virus. some viruses produce membrane invaginations, or \u201cspherules\u201d in the membranes of cellular organelles. other viruses produce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that can be found in isolation. enteroviruses produce ROs with a single-membrane tubule (SMT) morphology. they transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multilamellar vesicles. these membrane morphologies parallel those found in cells infected with cardioviruses. direct connections between donor organelle and nascent enterovirus ROs have been established. the lack of such connections in ultrastructural studies to date suggests that they are rare or transient and thus difficult to capture. this technique facilitates the reconstruction of large volumes (whole cells and tissues) but at the expense of resolution compared to conventional transmission electron microscopy (20). RESULTS Large-volume electron microscopy resolves RO ultrastructure during enterovirus infection. cells were infected with coxsackie B virus 3 (CVB3) and fixed at 6 h postinfection. cells were prepared and imaged by SBF-SEM along with mock-infected cells. is-Golgi cisternae and trans-Golgi network could be unambiguously identified in SBF-SEM reconstructions of mock-infected cells. in infected cells, prominent cellular organelles, like the nucleus, ER, and mitochondria, were also identified. the whole-cell visualizations confirm that Golgi apparatus cisternae disintegrate during enterovirus infection. the number of RO clusters and their respective volumes were quantified in the cells presented in panel B. the histogram of RO cluster sizes revealed a similar binary distribution in each cell, where the majority of RO volume in each cell falls within a single perinuclear cluster. cells A and B were each collected over 163 sections (8.1-m depth and total volume of 3,404 m3 per cell) copyright 2019 Melia et al.

BGM(S1\u201310) cells were transduced with mCherry-GM130. the addition of guanidine hydrochloride from 1 hpi prevented the formation of both peripheral and Golgi-associated 3A-GFP puncta. mCherry-GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, was infected with CVB3 encoding split-GFP-tagged 3A (21). confocal z-stacks were collected of cells with emerging 3A-GFP signal but at different stages of Golgi disassembly (5 hpi), which were then fixed and prepared for SBF-SEM. the intense GM130 signal in confocal data corresponds to recognizable Golgi apparatus cisternae in SBF-SEM data. a striking correspondence was found between 3A-GFP foci (e.g., white arrowheads) in the confo. a shift in the relative positions of 3A-GFP foci and RO clusters was apparent. this may be explained by migration of RO clusters in the delay between confocal z-stack acquisition and fixation. the cell presented in Fig. 2 represents an early stage of infection. the cell presented in Fig. 2 represents an early stage of infection. mCherry-GM130 and 3A-GFP signals correlated well with recognizable Golgi apparatus cisternae and RO clusters. mCherry-GM130 and 3A-GFP signals correlated well with recognizable Golgi apparatus cisternae and RO clusters, respectively. TEM images revealed continuities between trans-Golgi network tubules and single-membrane ROs. clusters correspond to ER-associated ROs that can be formed in addition to the Golgi-derived ROs observed in the same cell. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. significant spatial relationships between ROs and other cellular organelles were not clearly apparent in any cells analyzed. however, extensive contact regions could be found between RO clusters and lipid droplets (LDs), which in some cases appeared to be surrounded by ROs. ules (white arrowheads) and lipid droplets (LD) are depleted over the course of infection. vero E6 cells were infected or mock-infected with CVB3 at an MOI of 100, chemically fixed at the time points indicated, and then stained with oil red O. lipid droplets total area (square micrometers) and counts per cell were calculated. cells were prepared and imaged by SBF-SEM along with mock-infected cells. these data revealed expansive fields of ROs in infected cells. single- and double-membrane ROs were distinguishable from double-membrane (hatched arrowheads) or multilamellar (black arrowheads) ROs. TEM imaging of CVB3-infected cells resolves ROs in whole-cell context. cytosol is populated by clusters of ROs (example in boxed area) cellular organelles, including mitochondria (red), the ER (yellow), and the nucleus (blue) can be resolved alongside ROs (green) single-membrane, double-membrane, and multilamellar ROs can be distinguished in SBF-SEM data of infected cells. similar regions imaged by TEM resolve the individual membranes of these structures supporting the interpretation of SBF-SEM images. cellular organelles, clearly distinct in TEM images, can also be resolved in SBF-SEM data in uninfected cells. the total reconstructed volume was 3,404 m3. download Movie S1, AVI file, 17.6 MB (18MB, avi). Copyright 2019 Melia et al. the first foci of 3A protein arise in the cell periphery, often ahead of the dramatic 3A accumulation in the golgi region. it is unknown whether both the peripheral and Golgi-proximal 3A foci that emerge during this phase represent developing ROs. the small peripheral 3A foci that form early in infection are replication independent and that these 3A accumulations are simply the result of translation of the incoming vRNA delivered by uncoating of virus particles. BGM(S1\u201310) cells were transduced with mCherry-GM130 and infected with CVB3 3A(S11) the first 3A-GFP foci appear in the cell periphery (e.g., white arrowhead, 4 hpi), shortly before 3A-GFP signal starts accumulating in the Golgi region. highlight Golgi cisternae and RO clusters based solely on morphological features. mCherry-GM130 cell transduced with mCherry-GM130, infected with CVB3 3A(S11), and monitored by live-cell imaging until the emergence of the first 3A-GFP puncta. a good overall correspondence can also be established between 3A-GFP puncta and RO foci. a striking correspondence was found between 3A-GFP foci in the confocal data and the location of ROs highlighted by the SBF-SEM segmentation. the cell presented in Fig. 2 represents an early stage of infection encompassing the emergence of the first peripheral 3A-GFP foci. all RO clusters at this stage (Fig. 2B, white arrowheads) were observed in close contact with the ER (black arrowheads), with apparent membrane continuities between them (hatched arrowheads) the existence of membrane connections between peripheral RO clusters and ER was confirmed in higher-resolution TEM images of parallel samples. mCherry-GM130 and 3A-GFP signals correlated well with recognizable Golgi apparatus cisternae and RO clusters. mCherry-GM130 and 3A-GFP signals correlated well with recognizable Golgi apparatus cisternae and RO clusters. TEM imaging reveals membrane continuities (hatched arrowhead) TEM images revealed continuities between trans-Golgi network tubules and single-membrane ROs (hatched arrowheads) these data suggest early RO biogenesis occurs at seed points distributed across the ER, followed by RO formation at trans-Golgi membranes. analysis shows that these clusters correspond to ER-associated ROs that can be formed in addition to the Golgi-derived ROs observed in the same cell. LDs were depleted across CVB3 infection in our experimental setup. a quantitative analysis of LDs showed a particularly rapid drop early in infection (between 0 and 4 hpi) both in LD counts and the total LD area per cell. LD volume and count, with significant differences between some time points, represent the standard deviation. error bars represent the standard deviation. DISCUSSION Establishing the origin of viral ROs reveals important clues about the host cell requirements for their formation. ER- and Golgi-derived emerging foci were found to be the earliest ROs formed and the precursors of DMVs (12, 13) this suggests that the transformation from SMT to DMV is independent of SMT origin. the proliferation of ER-associated 3A-GFP foci was concomitant with Golgi disassembly (21) (Movie S2). ER- and Golgi-derived ROs are suitable sites for viral RNA synthesis. it is possible that both ER- and Golgi-derived ROs are suitable sites for viral RNA synthesis. further analyses of SEM volumes did not highlight membrane connections. PI4KA inhibition does not affect the final replication yield during enterovirus infection (28\u201330), suggesting that ER-derived ROs may confer a small benefit early in infection but are ultimately expendable for replication. PI4KB inhibition (19) could support the notion that ER-derived ROs require PI4KB. +RNA viruses are not constrained to utilizing membranes from a single cellular source for their replication. this work extends the growing body of evidence suggesting that +RNA viruses are not constrained to utilizing membranes from a single cellular source for their replication. cells were washed with FluoroBrite medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 25 mM HEPES just prior to imaging. for time-series imaging, positions of interest (xyz) were marked and imaged sequentially at 5-min intervals. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a live-cell chamber. stain LDs appeared as darkly stained circular profiles in the DIC images that were absent in unstained samples. LDs appeared as darkly stained circular profiles in the DIC images that could be also detected in fluorescent images using a Texas Red excitation filter. coverslips were excised using a razor blade and removed to a container resistant to propylene oxide. samples were then infiltrated with fresh undiluted Durcupan for 90 min. sections of 70 nm were cut from the sample block for imaging and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. two collection setups were used for samples fixed at 6 hpi. the 30- or 20-m aperture was used with an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. the imaging dwell time was 3 s (5-nm reported pixel size; horizontal frame width, 81.9 m), and 40-nm slice thickness. BGM(S1\u201310) cells were grown to 35% confluence in glass-bottom 35-mm dishes. transduced cells were infected with CVB3 3A(S11) 18 to 24 h later. cells were grown in glass-bottom MatTek dishes with an etched alphanumeric coordinate system. cells were monitored until the point of interest, at which time a confocal z-stack was acquired. samples were immediately fixed for electron microscopy. samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer for 60 min at room temperature. initial postfixation was carried out using a solution of 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer. samples were then stained with 1% aqueous thiocarbohydrazide for 20 min, followed by 2% aque conductive epoxy resin (CircuitWorks CW2400) trimmed to form a pillar approximately 400 by 400 by 150 m, ensuring regions of interest were retained in the block-face for correlative samples. TEM images were collected in an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTWIN microscope using an Eagle 4K slow-scan charge-coupled-device (FEI) or an FEI Twin at 120 kV. image stacks were acquired as dm3 files and converted to 32-bit tagged image files. images were Gaussian filtered (1 pixel), followed by unsharp mask and gray-level normalization (Adobe Photoshop). image stacks were then converted to 8-bit TIFs and aligned using the virtual align slices plugin (Fiji)."}
