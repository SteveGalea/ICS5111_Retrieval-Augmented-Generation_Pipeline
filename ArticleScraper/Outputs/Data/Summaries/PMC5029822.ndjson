{"summary": "mice were tested and found to be free from infections with cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Citrobacter rodentia, Clostridium piliforme, Corynebacterium kutscheri, ectromelia virus, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus, mouse parvovirus, mouse rotavirus, mouse thymic virus, My airflow on IVC racks was provided by top-mounted blower and exhaust motors. air was delivered into cages through a certified airdock at the back base. ACH was set by the manufacturer for blower motors. mice were housed for either 7 d under static conditions on a free-standing wire shelving rack or 14 d on an IVC rack. water loss was subtracted from total water consumption as assumed loss. urine samples were stored at \u201320 \u00b0C prior to analysis. TEWL measurement requires contact of the probe with hairless skin. hair removal was performed 24 h prior to TEWL measurement44. the significance level was set at a P value of less than 0.05. mice were tested and found to be free from infections with cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Citrobacter rodentia, Clostridium piliforme, Corynebacterium kutscheri. cages were kept on an IVC rack (Lab Products) or placed on a static wire-shelving rack with 76 cm 152.4 cm shelves spaced 38 cm apart vertically. airflow on IVC racks was provided by top-mounted blower and exhaust motors that used HEPA filter air from the room to keep the rack at negative pressure relative to the positive-pressure cages. chlorine-treated reverse-osmosis-purified water (chlorine, 1.5 ppm; pH 6 to 7) in 100-mL graduated water bottles. water consumption was measured by using graduations on the bottles. water loss in the absence of mice was subtracted from total water consumption as assumed loss. room temperatures were measured daily by using a hygrometer (Extech Big Digital, Fotronic, Melrose, MA) all measurements were recorded by the same person at the same time of day for each time point. data were analyzed by aNOVA multigroup comparison of means or by Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Mann\u2013Whitney nonparametric tests. the significance level was set at a P value of less than 0.05. results Body weight and water consumption in IVC- and static-housed hairless mice. therefore serial weights were averaged for mice within the same sex and strain. 4.4 0.1a 5.0 0.1b,c 4.7 0.1 5.8 0.2b,c Water, mL/d/25 g 4.8 4.4 5.2 4.3 5.4 4.7 5.1 5.6 Water consumption and body weight were measured every 48 h. female SCID and SKH mice weighed significantly less than did male mice when housed in static cages (P = 0.0003) SCID and SKH mice in static caging had significantly lower urine osmolality compared with the same strain housed in IVC. intracage humidity levels were not significantly affected by sex in either SCID or SKH mice.

Consistent with findings in SCID mice, male and female FVB mice drank significantly (P 0.05) less water when housed in IVC as compared with static cages. however, only C57 female mice housed in static cages drank significantly less than did male mice under the same housing condition. female FVB and C57 mice weighed significantly less than did male mice in static cages (P = 0.0069) female C57 mice drank significantly less than did male C57 mice in static cages (P = 0.78) male and female C57 mice housed in IVC drank more water under static housing conditions. in IVC- and static-housed furred mice IVC Static FVB C57 FVB C57 Female Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Male Sex-specific 3490 237 3093 137 1980 87 2403 318 2292 58 2224 60 1328 65b 1683 85a,c n 50 56 44 38 28 33 56 36 Overall 3280 133 NA 2255 41b NA n 106 61 NA, data not combined due to sex- humidity levels were measured every 48 h starting 24 h after cage change. male and female FVB mice had significantly (P 0.05) higher TEWL when housed in either static or IVC conditions. male C57 mice had significantly (P 0.05) higher TEWL than female mice when housed in either static or static conditions. TEWL was measured every 48 h: 5 mice per cage, 4 cages per strain and sex. TEWL was significantly increased in IVC as compared with static housing conditions for both strains and sexes. the addition of mice to cages increased humidity from 27% within the mouse room to 68% to 79% for IVC and 70% to 73% under static conditions. both IVC and static mouse cages had significantly higher temperature and humidity levels as compared with the animal holding room levels. 0% increased for both static and IVC as compared with the room alone. a P 0.01 compared with control under the same conditions b P 0.01. body weight did not change significantly over time for mice housed in static or IVC conditions. therefore serial weights were averaged for mice within the same sex and strain. female SCID and SKH mice weighed significantly less than their male counterparts. male and female SKH mice drank more water under static housing conditions. SKH and SCID mice in static caging had significantly lower urine osmolality compared with the same strain housed in IVC(P 0.01). intracage humidity levels were not significantly affected by sex in either mice.

TEWL was measured every 48 h: 5 mice per cage, 4 cages per strain and sex. TEWL was significantly increased in IVC as compared with static housing conditions for both strains and sexes. 27% within the mouse room to 68% to 79% for IVC and 70% to 73% under static conditions. all intracage temperature and humidity values were averaged for a single strain (IVC, n = 56; static, n = 32) both IVC and static mouse cages had significantly higher temperature and humidity levels as compared with the room levels. a P 0.01 compared with control under the same conditions b P 0.01 compared with same strain in IVC Discussion Water metabolism is a simple balance between water intake and loss. in mice, the primary types of water loss include sensible loss via urine and insensible loss through the respiratory tract and skin. female SCID and male SKH mice drank more water under both housing conditions. water consumption increases in C57 mice fed a high salt diet (4%); however, all mice were fed a standard rodent chow with a salt content of 0.8% in the current study. urine osmolality was higher in male C57 mice than female C57 mice housed in static caging. 80% of insensible water loss in mice occurs through the respiratory tract. water loss through the respiratory tract occurs at the level of the alveoli. TEWL is a physiologically significant source of insensible water loss (20%) that is modulated by environmental parameters. higher intracage humidity has been associated with decreased water consumption by mice housed in both IVC (compared with open-top cages) 52 and static (closed top) microisolation cages. TEWL levels are expected to increase to maintain physiologic water balance. hairless SKH mice have been shown to adapt to environmental changes. the ability of furred mice to alter the epidermis and TEWL in response to differences in environmental humidity has not been reported previously. the use of depilatory creams for hair removal is effective, nontoxic, and significantly reduces skin-surface bacteria. this process might disrupt or damage the epidermal barrier. IVC and static cages have been reported to have an increased difference of 5% to 10% as compared with the animal holding room. we hypothesized that IVC caging would alter water metabolism by reducing intracage humidity and temperature levels as compared with those in static cages. average humidity was lower in IVC than static cages. the presence of increased humidity in the absence of mice was thought to be caused by evaporation or water leakage during manipulation of the empty cage. the ability of SKH and SCID mice to regulate epidermal function to retain water and maintain water balance contradicts the assumption that hairless mice housed in IVC might be prone to dehydration. however, increased TEWL in furred mice housed in IVC may indicate that the epidermis may not compensate for depilation."}
