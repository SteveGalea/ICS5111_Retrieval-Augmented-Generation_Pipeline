{"summary": "a novel CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in 2012 in two human patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia. since then, the WHO has reported 2,144 laboratory-confirmed cases and at least 750 deaths. the study of the virus-host interaction is essential to develop antiviral therapies and safe vaccines. the 3a protein is 274 amino acids (aa) in length with three transmembrane domains (TMDs) it causes membrane rearrangements in infected cells, leading to an increase in levels of intracellular vesicles. it colocalizes with M protein, which is essential for virus assembly. overexpression assays showed that ORF8a induces apoptosis through a mitochondrion-dependent pathway. PDZ domains are protein recognition sequences 80 to 90 aa in length. peptide sequences most frequently located at the C terminus of the IC proteins. mutational analysis showed that only the 3a and E proteins were clearly involved in SARS-CoV replication and virulence. Neither single deletion of the IC activity or of PBM from protein 3a diminished SARS-CoV replication and virulence. the 3a and E mutants grew to lower titers than the parental wild-type (wt) virus. but the 8a virus reached peak titers (9 107 PFU/ml) similar to those observed for the parental virus. at 2 and 4 dpi, 3 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine lung virus titers. data represent means standard deviations (SD) the decrease in virus titers after SARS-CoV-MA15-3a infection was greater in vivo than in vitro. proteins E and 3a were shown to be critical for both in vitro and in vivo virus replication. mice infected with viruses lacking either E protein or 3a protein recovered from infection with 100% survival. s of five 16-week-old BALB/c mice were subjected to mock infection (PBS, gray filled circles) or infected with 100,000 PFU of either the parental virus (wt, black filled circles) or genetically engineered viruses missing E protein (E, blue filled squares), 3a protein (3a, red filled circles) or 8a protein (8a, green filled diamonds) single-channel conductance was estimated from a statistical analysis of the current jump amplitudes. this procedure allows a reliable estimate of the most probable value of current change every time a new channel is inserted or disappears. protein 3a IC showed resistance (ohmic) behavior for both positive and negative potentials. the protein 3a IC behaved as a neutral channel with no preference for anions or cations. reference Erev values represent theoretical values for a neutral pore. a set of recombinant baculoviruses expressing mutated 3a proteins was engineered. mutants with changes to a single TMD (TMD1, TMD2, or TMD3) or to two TMD[2,3] variants were engineered. mutant proteins were expressed and purified, and their IC activity was evaluated. protein 3a IC activity was not required for SARS-CoV replication and virulence. protein 3a IC activity was not required for SARS-CoV replication and virulence. 2, -TMD3, -TMD[2,3], -Y91A, -H93A, -Y109A, -Y113A, and -Q116A. all these viruses were similar with respect to growth kinetics in vero E6 cells. replication was not significantly affected by altered protein 3a IC activity. at 2 and 4 dpi, 3 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine virus titers. the requirement for protein 3a IC activity in vivo was also studied by measuring the titers of 3a IC mutants in the lungs. all mice infected with the parental virus or the TMD1 mutant showed disease symptoms starting at 2 dpi. 80% of the mice had died by between 4 and 7 dpi. mice infected with either TMD3 or TMD[2,3] mutants recovered with 100% survival. 3a mutants Y91A, H93A, Y109A, Y113A, or Q116A were evaluated for weight loss and survival through 10 dpi. all mice were evaluated for weight loss and survival through 10 dpi. no compensatory mutations restoring IC activity were identified in this experiment. the 3aPBM mutant was as pathogenic as the parental virus. these results indicated that replication and virus virulence were independent of the PBM of protein 3a. groups of six 16-week-old BALB/c mice were subjected to mock infection. all possible combinations of single-, double-, and triple-deletion mutants were engineered. all combinations were efficiently rescued, with the remarkable exceptions of the triple mutant and the one lacking both E and 3a proteins. 106 SARS-CoV [E, 8a] + (6.6 1.4) 105 SARS-CoV [3a, 8a] + (2.4 1.1) 105 SARS-CoV [3a, 8a] + 2.0 101a SARS-CoV [3a, 8a] 2.0 101a SARS-CoV [3a, 8a] 2.0 101a a Data were below the detection threshold. the results showed that either the 3a protein or the E protein must be present 3a protein did not localize at any of the main intracellular calcium storage locations, suggesting that it is not located at a site that facilitates increased cytosolic calcium levels. IC activity of proteins 3a and E is not the function responsible for the replacement for the full-length E and 3a proteins. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) in all cases, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) in all cases, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) in all cases, nuclei were stained with DAPI. the viability of each mutant was determined after rescue from infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. the viability of each mutant was determined after rescue from infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. the protein 3a PBM was mutated in the context of full-length E protein deletion [(3a-PBM,E)], but the rescue of this virus was not possible. changes to the protein included: alanine substitutions in the N-terminal domain [rSARS-CoV-MA15-(3a,E1)]; short in-frame deletions throughout the C-terminal domain [(3a,E-PBM)] virus titers were significantly decreased after one passage for mutants 3a,E1 and 3a,E-PBM(rev) compared to the 3a virus. this mutant virus was viable, indicating the lack of sequence specificity for the observed functionality. mutants with one [(3a-PBM) or (E-PBM) viral PBM sequences removed were generated. virus titers decreased 10-fold when both viral PBMs were missing. mortality significantly decreased when E protein lacked a PBM. -type) virus (WT; black filled hexagons) or of genetically engineered viruses lacking either the protein 3a PBM (3a-PBM, red filled diamonds) or the E protein PBM (E-PBM, ochre filled circles) or both were required for efficient replication in vitro and in vivo. subconfluent monolayers of vero E6 cells were infected with wild-type (WT) (black filled circles), E (blue filled squares), 3a (red filled circles), and 8a (green filled diamonds) SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.001. culture supernatants were collected at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hpi and titrated by plaque assay. viruses were titrated by plaque assay. the results are representative of three replicate experiments. the results are representative of three replicate experiments. c mice were subjected to mock infection or infected with parental rSARS-CoV-MA15 or with one of the deletion mutants rSARS-CoV-MA15-3a, -E, and -8a. clinical disease and survival were monitored through 10 dpi. mice infected with viruses lacking either E protein or 3a protein recovered from infection with 100% survival. we studied 3a protein in planar lipid bilayers and identified the amino acids involved in ion conductance. this system was used because its high sensitivity allows the detection of electric currents of a single ion channel (50) a baculovirus was engineered to express the parental 3a protein in Sf-9 cells. a single-channel insertion of SARS-CoV 3a protein showed a linear current-voltage relationship. the protein showed a linear current-voltage relationship. the theoretical Erev is calculated using the goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. higher, lower, or similar measured Erev values indicate anion selectivity, cation selectivity, or no selectivity. however, in the presence of monovalent ions, the protein 3a IC behaved as a neutral channel with no preference for anions or cations. mutants with changes to a single TMD (TMD1, TMD2, or TMD3) or to two TMDs (TMD[2,3]) were engineered (54, 55). mutants with changes to a single TMD (TMD1, TMD2, or TMD3) or to two TMDs (TMD[2,3]) were engineered (Table 2). Mutant 3a proteins were expressed in insect cells and purified. mutant proteins were expressed and purified, and their IC activity was evaluated. TMD3 point mutants Y91A and Y113A completely abrogated protein 3a IC activity. protein 3a IC activity was not required for SARS-CoV replication and virulence. groups of six 16-week-old mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of either the parental virus (WT, black columns), or mutants TMD1 (light green columns), TMD2 (light blue columns), TMD3 (ochre columns), Y91A (purple columns), Y109A (orange columns), Y113A (dark brown columns), and Q116A (red columns). at 2 and 4 dpi, 3 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine virus every mutant showed replication levels similar to those seen with the wt strain. titers at least 1 log unit lower than those seen with the rest of the viruses. protein 3a IC activity for SARS-CoV replication was studied in two independent experiments. atory mutations restoring IC activity were identified in any case. the results suggest that the TMD3 and TMD[2,3] mutants were attenuated in an IC-independent manner, since the TMD2 mutant was only marginally attenuated. all mice were evaluated for weight loss and survival through 10 dpi. no compensatory mutations restoring IC activity were identified in this experiment. a virus lacking a functional PBM in the 3a protein (3aPBM) was engineered. replication and virus virulence were independent of the PBM of protein 3a. group of six 16-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of the parental virus. at 2 and 4 dpi, 3 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine virus titers. data summarize two replicate experiments with equivalent results. the titers of viruses missing 8a and 3a or E were significantly lower than the titers of 3a and E viruses. every one of the viable mutant viruses which lacked either 3a or E proteins showed plaque sizes significantly smaller than those seen with the wt and 8a viruses. rSARS-CoV-MA15 was infecting vero E6 cells with wt rSARS-CoV. the protein localized to the ERGIC (56), but less is known about protein 3a localization (27). the potential colocalization of the 3a and E proteins was first studied. 3a protein did not localize at any of the main intracellular calcium storage locations. this suggests that the IC activity of proteins 3a and E is not the function responsible for the replacement for the full-length E and 3a proteins. in all cases, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) a set of 3a mutants was engineered with substitutions or deletions throughout the E protein sequence. the viability of each mutant was determined after rescue from infectious bacterial artificial chromosome clones. mutations within the N-terminal domain or TMD of protein E did not affect virus viability, indicating that neither harbored the motif responsible for viroporin replacement. however, when the original PBM was substituted for an alternative one [(3a,E-PBM*)], viable virus was recovered. truncated mutant [(3a,E-PBM)] rapidly reverted in the first passage. truncation of the E protein by introduction of a stop codon 6 aa upstream of the PBM. interruption of the E protein PBM by amino acid substitutions within its core sequence [(3a,E-PBM)] mutant virus was viable, indicating lack of sequence specificity for the observed functionality. viability of a SARS-CoV 3a mutant with a deletion of 6 amino acids was evaluated in vero E6 cells. a collection of mutants with one [(3a-PBM) or (E-PBM)] or both viral PBM sequences removed was generated. the impact of the presence or absence of the E protein PBM on virulence is definitive, as it determines whether a virus is pathogenic or nonpathogenic. the presence or absence of 3a protein with or without its PBM had little impact on virus virulence, illustrating the much greater relevance of the E protein PBM than of the 3a PBM with respect to virus pathogenicity. roporins in replication and virulence were studied only for SARS-CoV E protein (34, 46, 58, 60) roles in replication have also been established for HCoV-OC43 ns12.9 (25), HCoV-229E 4a (24), and PEDV 3 (26). IC activity of protein 5 is yet to be studied in detail. the reduction of titers after infection with 3a mutant viruses may reflect the role of 3a in membrane rearrangement. protein 3a may induce apoptosis (30, 63) and may enhance inflammation by activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). deletion of SARS-CoV protein 8a alone did not have a measurable effect on replication and virulence in mice. this is in line with the fact that ORF8 was lost during the SARS-CoV pandemic and that viruses lacking this gene were recovered from patients who died from SARS-CoV infection. no correlation was found between protein 3a IC activity and SARS-CoV titer and pathogenicity. however, the IC activity of 3a protein did not affect replication and virulence in the same way as that of E protein. in principle, the TMD3 three-amino-acid mutations present in both mutants could have disrupted a function of the 3a protein other than its IC activity. protein 3a is not found at any of the main intracellular Ca2+ storage locations. IC activity most likely induces cellular pathways that are less relevant to pathogenicity. protein 3a is located at the Golgi compartment or at the cell surface. the interaction of the E protein PBM with syntenin PDZ motifs activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. there are 266 motifs present in more than 400 cellular protein isoforms, each containing between 1 and 13 PDZ domains (42). a 3a protein carrying a PBM could compensate for the loss of the other viroporin providing that it carried a functional PBM. reversion of a stop codon introduced 9 aa upstream of the carboxy terminus of the E protein in mutant PBM. different strains of rabies virus include a variety of PBMs in the G protein that differentially contribute to viral virulence through activation of a variety of signaling pathways (70). in the case of influenza virus, NS1 protein has a PBM located at its carboxy terminus that is possibly involved in enhanced virulence (71). infected mice were housed in a self-contained ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) recombinant viruses were rescued from infectious cDNA clones. mutations in SARS-CoV viroporins E, 3a, and 8a were constructed in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV was digested with nt 26044 and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV. the fragment carrying the deletion of the 8a gene was reinserted into a similarly digested pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 plasmid to generate pBAC-S overlap extension PCR was performed using plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as a template and the primers indicated in Table S1. plasmids were digested with PmeI and BamHI and recloned into pBAC-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate infectious SARS-CoV cDNA clones. plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-3amutPBM was digested with BamHI and RsrII. fragment carrying the mutated 3a PBM was reinserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-3amutPBM. all constructs of the 3a gene were cloned into a pFastBac vector (invitrogen) containing a tobacco etch virus cleavable site and 10 histidine residues fused to the C terminus of the 3a constructs. recombinant baculoviruses were produced following the instructions of the manufacturer (invitrogen) eight-week-old specific-pathogen-free mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories and maintained for 8 additional weeks in the animal care facility at the National Center of Biotechnology (Madrid) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated at 16 weeks of age with 100,000 PFU of the indicated viruses. ed to PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primer pairs: 24937-VS (GGCGACATTTCAGGCATTAACGC) and 26086-RS (GGCACGCTAGTAGTCGTCGTCGCG), which amplify the 3a gene. 27545-VS (GGAGGTTCAACAAGAGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTGC) and 28008-RS (GACAGTGTGTGTGTGC ally inoculated with 100,000 PFU of virus mixed with 50 l of DMEM. lungs were homogenized in PBS containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B. titrations were performed in vero E6 cells as previously described. aqueous solutions of KCl, NaCl, or CaCl2 were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at room temperature (23 1\u00b0C) an electric potential was applied using Ag/AgCl electrodes in 2 M KCl\u20131.5% agarose bridges assembled within standard 250-l pipette tips. cells were grown to 90% confluence on glass coverslips and infected with wt SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell. at 24 hpi, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde\u2013PBS for 30 min at room temperature. cells were then washed twice with PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with ice-cold methanol, and then coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and examined on a leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) image analysis was performed using ImageJ (79) and the JACoP plug-in (57).
