{"summary": "studies indicate that RSV infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in children with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) in both industrialized and developing countries [1\u20134]. Approximately 34 million RSV-related ALRIs occur in children under 5 years of age, resulting in at least 3.4 million hospitalizations and 66,000\u2013199,000 RSV-related deaths. study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC, Beijing, China) subjects with laboratory confirmed RSV infection were hospitalized at 12 sentinel hospitals located in 6 provinces in eastern china between January 2009 and December 2013. patient enrollment, sample collection, laboratory testing, and case reporting were conducted by all sentinel hospitals and laboratories according to a national surveillance protocol. all specimens were tested for RSV (A and B subtypes), human influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and enterovirus (EV) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase all sentinel hospitals and laboratories according to a national surveillance protocol [17]. patients were admitted to surveillance wards presided over by the departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases or to the intensive care units of the abovementioned sentinel hospitals. they were screened by physicians and nurses for ALRI. descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients with RSV infection. 154 (14.7%) were diagnosed with RSV-A, 253 (24.2%) were diagnosed with RSV-B, 249 (23.8%) were subtyping not performed, and 390 (37.3%) were diagnosed with coinfections with RSV and other respiratory tract viruses. a total of 12 sentinel hospitals located in six provinces were enrolled in the final RSV infection analysis. a total of 12 sentinel hospitals located in six provinces were enrolled in the final analysis. the median age of patients with RSV single-infections (8\u201312 months) was considerably lower than that of patients with coinfections (24 months) the median age of patients with RSV single-infections (8\u201312 months) was considerably lower than that of patients with coinfections (24 months) the majority of RSV infections occurred between September 2010 and February 2011. RSV-A infections were most frequently observed between January and April in 2009, 2010 and 2013. temperature of 38\u00b0C was documented in 61.0% of patients with RSV infection. 59.0% of patients with RSV coinfection with other viruses at time of physical examination. significant differences between patients with RSV coinfections and patients with RSV single-infections were observed. of the patients with pneumonia/RSV coinfection was not significantly different from that of patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV single-infection (2 = 0.653, P = 0.419) Table 2.
