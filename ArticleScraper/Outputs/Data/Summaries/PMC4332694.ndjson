{"summary": "clinical signs are similar to those described for human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS) clinical signs are similar to those described for human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS) prospective controlled studies investigating the course of naturally acquired FIV infection have not been described. in this controlled study, we examined clinical and laboratory parameters from two cohorts of cats living in different locations and kept under different housing conditions. the remaining twenty-seven FIV-positive cats enrolled (Group 2) were housed together in a large multi-cat household operating as an FIV-positive cat rescue in Memphis, TN. a total of 53 FIV-positive and 10 FIV-negative cats were housed indoors with unrestricted access to one another. none of 10 FIV-negative cats from the same household died during the study period. an entry criterion for age- and sex-matched FIV-negative cats was healthy status at the enrolment examination. serial physical examinations and specimen collections were made at 6-monthly intervals in FIV-positive cats over the study period. Flow cytometric analyses were performed as previously described. the assay detects the presence of viral nucleic acid in peripheral blood leukocytes with 80.5% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity. the mantel\u2013Cox \u2018log-rank\u2019 test tested with the log-rank test for trends. forty-four neutered, FIV-positive (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test) cats were enrolled, with an equal number of age- and sex-matched FIV-negative cats from the same geographical locations. a total of 53 FIV-positive and 10 FIV-negative cats were housed indoors with unrestricted access to one another. none of the enrolled FIV-negative cats from the same household died during the study period. the date of the first known positive FIV ELISA test was obtained for all FIV-positive cats. the time between first diagnosis and study enrolment (months) was calculated. phylogenetic analysis Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed in MEGA5. Statistical support for the ML trees was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates. multiple env sequences (n = 355), from cats enrolled in the study were subjected to rigorous recombination testing as described previously. group 1 (n = 17) group 2 (n = 27) all FIV-positive cats (n = 44) Breed DSH (94%), DLH (6%) DSH (74%), DLH (15%), Siamese X (11%) DSH (82%), DLH (11%), Siamese X (7%) Gender FS (18%), MN (82%) FS (33.3%), MN (66.6%) FS (27%), MN (73%) Age (years; -mortem with lymphoma (44%; 4/9) was classified as healthy at the time of enrolment. health status on the day of enrolment and post-mortem diagnoses for FIV-positive cats deceased during the study. post-mortem findings During the 22-month study period, 1/17 (5.9%) FIV-positive cats from Group 1 and 17/27 (63%) FIV-positive cats from Group 2 died. in group 2, post-mortem data were not available for one cat (M33) median time since first ELISA test to death in cats with lymphoma was 5.3 years (range, 2.9\u20139 years) median time since first ELISA test to death was 5.3 years (range, 2.9\u20139 years) those cats lost a median of 10.9% of their bodyweight between enrolment and 3 months before death. median bodyweight loss in the last 3 months of life was 29.5%. grey boxes denote cats alive at the end of the 22-month study period. enrolment weights for matched FIV-negative cats from group 2 that died were significantly lower than those for matched FIV-negative cats. difference between FIV-positive (median 0.89, range 0.19\u20132.24) and FIV-negative cats (median 1.71, range 1.03\u20132.62) was statistically significant at the time of enrolment (P 0.0001) and 12 months later. the CD4:CD8 ratio in surviving FIV-positive cats was maintained over 18 months at a consistently low level. for group 1, data represent 17 FIV-positive cats and 17 age- and sex-matched FIV-negative cats at enrolment (E) data were collected from 27 surviving FIV-positive cats and 16 surviving FIV-negative cats at 12 months after enrolment (12M) the CD4:CD8 ratios at the time of enrolment in the FIV-positive cats from Group 1 were lower (median 0.77, range 0.08\u20131.27) than those of the FIV-positive cats from Group 2 (median 0.89, range 0.19\u20132.23; Fig. 3). there were no statistically significant differences when the ratio was compared between cats classified as healthy and not healthy at enrolment. count from enrolment (median 0.44 K/L, range 0.18\u20131.49 K/L) to terminal disease (median 0.38 K/L, range 0.06\u20131.68 K/L; P = 0.35) decreased in absolute lymphocyte numbers between enrolment (median 1.73 K/L, range 1.15\u20134.03 K/L) and terminal disease. cats that had died by the end of the study period were classified at enrolment as either healthy or not healthy. cats that had died by the end of the study period were classified at enrolment as either healthy or not healthy. n = 5, median 56,867 genomes/mL blood, range, 2540\u2013418,671 genomes/mL blood; not healthy, n = 4, median 27,771 genomes/mL blood, range, 16,176\u201343,138 genomes/mL blood; P > 0.05. NH, not healthy on the day of enrolment (no abnormalities detected on a physical examination; Group 1, n = 8, Group 2, n = 15); A, alive at clade B env viruses and clade A/B recombinant env viruses each accounted for 50% of infections. in group 2, 69% of cats were infected with viruses bearing clade B env. 31% of cats were infected with recombinant env viruses. health status In the group at the time of enrolment, there were equal numbers of healthy (n = 22) and not healthy animals (n = 22) in group 1, 10 cats were classified as healthy (59%) and seven cats were classified as not healthy (41%); all but one cat remained in this classification during the observation period. 63% of cats (17/27) from Group 2 experienced severe weight loss and died during the study period. nematode larval pneumonia; bone marrow hyperplasia M30 NH Lymphoid depletion; aelurostrongylus abstrusus pneumonia; left front leg suppurative dermocellulitis. no post-mortem performed M41 NH Lymphoma \u2013 bone marrow and lymph nodes M44 NH Emaciation/nephritis/pancreatitis M46 H Lymphoma the most common pathological finding at post-mortem in Group 2 was lymphoma. four cats had lymphoma limited to a single site and bone marrow involvement. the second most common finding was nodal lymphoma, diagnosed in 5/9 cats (56%) and accompanied by splenic lymphoma. multifocal lymphocytic interstitial nephritis was diagnosed in six cats (37.5%) in four cats, there were pathological signs of respiratory tract infection and pneumonia. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and signs of congestive heart failure were identified in the single FIV-positive cat from Group 1 that died. none of the FIV-negative cats died during the study period. the 16 FIV-positive cats from Group 1 that survived gained a median of 7.6% bodyweight over the 12 months following enrolment. the 10 FIV positive cats from Group 2 that remained alive lost a median of 12.8% of their bodyweight over the 12 months following enrolment. enrolment weights for FIV-positive cats from Group 2 that died were significantly lower than those for matched FIV-negative cats. positive, median 5.12 kg, range 3.34\u20137.68 kg; FIV-negative median 5.8 kg, range 4.6\u20139.0 kg; P = 0.1641) and 12 months later. difference between FIV-positive (median 0.89, range 0.19\u20132.24) and FIV-negative cats (median 1.71, range 1.03\u20132.62) was statistically significant at the time of enrolment. data were collected from 21 surviving FIV-positive cats and 21 FIV-negative cats. the central bar in the box denotes the median, while the top and bottom of the box represent the 75th and 25th centiles respectively. the upper and lower bars represent the 95th and 5th centiles, respectively. cats were classified as healthy (H) or not healthy (NH) based on physical examination findings at the time of enrolment. the central bar in the box denotes the median, while the top and bottom of the box represent the 75th and 25th centiles. cell count 0.17 K/L, range 0.04\u20130.37 K/L; P = 0.0061) cell count and CD4:CD8 ratio at enrolment (E) and terminally (T) from the FIV-positive cats from Group 2 that died during the study (n = 17) there were no statistically significant differences in FIV load at group 2. cats that had died by the end of the study period were classified at enrolment as either healthy or not healthy (healthy, n = 6, median 241,757 genomes/mL blood, range, 7724\u20131,667,000 genomes/mL blood; not healthy, n = 11, median 176,551 genomes/mL blood; range, 13,423\u20133,792,000 genomes/mL blood; P > 0.05). ***P 0.0001. Statistical correlations between FIV load and CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were investigated for each group. clade B env viruses and clade A/B recombinant env viruses each accounted for 50% of infections.

Lymph node follicular hyperplasia and dysplasia was documented post-mortem in this study. reactive changes in the bone marrow, observed in 56% of cats in this study, have been documented previously in HIV and FIV infections. group 2 diagnosed with lymphoma and those from group 1 were all classified as domestic shorthairs. the shelter environment in which the cats lived was likely to play a role in the development of various clinical manifestations of FIV. the hallmark of FIV infection is an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio. the lowest CD4:CD8 ratio (0.08) at enrolment was classified as healthy and is still alive. similar observations have been reported previously in FIV and HIV infections (Levy, 1988) the variability in CD4:CD8 ratios among healthy and not healthy cats in this study population also limited their utility in the prediction of disease progression. cats from both groups were infected with highly virulent strains of FIV. phylogenetic analyses of full-length env sequences showed that viral isolates were not transmitted between cats despite unrestricted cohabitation. a limitation of this study is the restriction of enrolments to two distinct geographic areas. the cats in our study were originally adopted from shelters. many were entire and had outdoor access at the time of shelter intake. infection was more common in male cats, confirming results of previous studies. mmc1.docx (17.9KB, docx) Table S2 CD4+ T cell count (K/L) for FIV-positive cats from Group 1 (n = 14) and Group 2 (n = 27)"}
