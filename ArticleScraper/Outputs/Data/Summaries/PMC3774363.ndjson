{"summary": "IL-32 has been shown to be an important cytokine in diseases characterized by inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,3 IL-32 can be stimulated by IFN-, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and some exogenous pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (3). type III IFNs are a newly designated IFN family that includes IFN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3 (also designated IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively) type III IFNs bind to a distinct receptor complex composed of one exclusive chain and a second chain that is shared with the receptors for IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 (11, 12) IL-32 induced the expression of IFN-1 in PBMCs, leading to extensive antiviral activity during viral infection. all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. cells were washed twice in saline and suspended in culture medium. they were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. transfection of PBMCs, Jurkat cells, and THP-1 cells was achieved by electroporation. the plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated with streptavidin-HRP. the 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added. 50 ml of 2 n sulfuric acid was added to stop the enzyme reaction. the promoter was amplified from human genomic DNA and subcloned into a pGL3-promoter vector. different constructs were also generated from pGL3-IFN-1 (728 bp) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. real time PCR was performed with a standard PCR kit protocol. primers for IL-32 were designed to bind a common sequence target on all six isoforms for measuring total IL-32 mRNA. the immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using protein A/G-agarose beads. the pellets were incubated at 67 \u00b0C for 5 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-links. the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and extracted three times with phenol/chloroform. the pellets were resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer and subject to PCR amplification. two arrays were used for immunohistochemical tests with rabbit anti-IL-32 antibody and mouse anti-IFN-1. antibodies, Cytokines, and Inhibitors polyclonal antibodies (Abs) against human IL-32 were used for western blot analysis. line derived from HepG2 cells stably expresses HBV (Genotype D, Serotype ayw, U95551) was used as an HBV replication model. plasmid PN-HBV-1.3, which expresses HBV (Genotype C, Serotype adr, FJ899793), was a gift from Dr. Dongping Xu. primers P53 and P54 cover three RNAs of HBV, including S (2.1 kb), pre-S (2.4 kb), and C-E or pgRNA (3.5 kb), except the X mRNA. the value of real time PCR with P51 and P52 subtracted by that with P53 and P54 represents the level of X mRNA. the genotype 2a virus was a gift from Dr. Takaji Wakita from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan. the Huh7.5.1 cells were infected with this virus and used as a model of HCV infection and replication (35). all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

IL-32 rabbit polyclonal Ab was used to neutralize IL-32 in the supernatant. IFN-1 Ab (MAB15981, R&D Systems) and IFN- Ab were used in the neutralization assays. plasmid PN-HBV-1.3 expresses HBV (Genotype C, Serotype adr, FJ899793) was a gift from Dr. Dongping Xu (Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing, China) HBsAg and HBeAg levels in the culture supernatant were measured with commercial ELISA-based kits. RT-PCR for HBV RNA was performed as described previously. human embryonal RD cells growing in plates were incubated with enterovirus 71 (EV71; C4 subtype, Xiangfan, Hubei, China) at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 1 h with gentle shaking for 15 min. the cells were then removed from the medium, washed twice with PBS, and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium for 4 h. mice were inoculated with 10 g of pAAV-HBV-1.3 plasmid and/or 20 g of pCMV-IL-32. the 30 g of plasmid in a volume of 0.9% NaCl solution equivalent to 0.1 ml/g of mouse body weight was injected into the tail veins of mice within 5\u20138 s. RPMI 1640 medium, DMEM, and minimum Eagle's medium were purchased from Invitrogen. they were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. the cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. ELISA for IL-32 and IFN-1 Measurement IL-32 production in the culture supernatants was measured by ELISA as described in prior studies. the 96-well plates were precoated with commercial mAbs against IL-32 (KU32-56, 4 mg/ml; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 \u00b0C and blocked with 1% BSA. the IFN-1 levels in the cell medium supernatants and serum samples were measured using a commercial ELISA kit. the fragment encoding luciferase was amplified by PCR from the pGL3-promoter and subcloned into a pCMV-Tag2A-Luc vector to generate pCMV-Tag2A-Luc. each sample was cotransfected with 50 ng of a pRL-TK plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase to monitor transfection efficiency. twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h before they were harvested. the assay results are expressed as relative luciferase activity. the immunoblots were visualized with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) the harvested cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) the patients spanned all chronic HBV infection phases according to HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels (29). the same volume of serum was obtained from each of 40 healthy individuals who were routinely screened in the hospital with health tests and had no detectable diseases. IL-32 rabbit polyclonal Ab was used to neutralize IL-32 in the supernatant. anti-p65, anti-RelB, anti-CREB1, anti-CREB2 and negative control rabbit IgG Abs were used in the neutralization assays. HBsAg and HBeAg levels in the culture supernatant of HBV-positive cells or patient sera were measured with commercial ELISA-based kits (Shanghai KeHua Biotech Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) to detect HBV replication, the intracellular core-associated DNA in HBV was extracted and quantified by real time PCR. RT-PCR for HBV RNA was performed as described previously (33). the cells were then removed from the medium, washed twice with PBS, and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium for 4 h. when the antiviral treatment was finished, 100 l of supernatant from the infected RD cells was dissolved in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. the viral mRNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into a cDNA library. the 30 g of plasmid in a volume of 0.9% NaCl solution was injected into the tail veins of mice within 5\u20138 s. the relationship between miR-29b and IL-32 mRNA expression, IL-32 and IFN-1 protein expression, and HBV DNA and IL-32 in patient samples were analyzed. IL-32 mRNA is highly expressed in immune tissue rather than other tissue. in PBMCs, expression levels of pgRNA and X mRNA are 16.2 and 33.9% less than levels in HepG2.2.15 cells. IL-32 was significantly up-regulated by HBV infection in these cells. ants of jurkat cells, THP-1 cells, and PBMCs were measured by ELISA. data are expressed as OD values (D) IL-32 mRNA levels were analyzed by real time PCR (E) the binding of the NF-B p65 protein on both regions of the promoter was significantly strengthened by HBV. in contrast, the binding of NF-B RelB and the CREB protein were not remarkably changed. PBMCs were electroporated with pHBV or an empty vector. after 24 h, IL-32 levels in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. luciferase activities were analyzed 48 h after electroporation. IL-32 3\u2032-UTR luciferase reporter plasmids were co-transfected into HepG2 cells. luciferase activities were analyzed after serum starvation for 24 h. luciferase activity was analyzed by targeting prediction program. miRNAs target the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNAs and regulate expression of numerous genes by catalyzing the cleavage of mRNA (41) or repressing mRNA translation (42). to identify miRNAs that may target and alter the expression of IL-32, we used several programs for miRNA targeting prediction. IL-32 mRNA levels in miR-29b-transfected cells were significantly decreased. transfection with the miR-29b inhibitor resulted in up to 2-fold increases in IL-32 mRNA levels compared with controls. intracellular and extracellular proteins were also analyzed by Western blot and ELISA respectively. the expression of miR-29b and IL-32 in human PBMCs was also detected by real time PCR. a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between IL-32 mRNA and miR-29b in the PBMC samples from HBV patients. PBMCs were isolated from healthy individuals (n = 10) and HBV-infected patients (n = 17) the relative miR-29b levels in these samples were analyzed by real time PCR. the intracellular HBV DNA was measured by real time PCR. pCMV-IL-32 or vector was transfected into L02, Huh7, and Hep3B cells. HBsAg/HBeAg levels in the cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were incubated with pHBV-transfected Hep3B cells and the replication of HBV was measured. the supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were then incubated with pHBV-transfected Hep3B cells, and the replication of HBV was measured. rhIL-32-treated PBMCs transfected the PNL4-3 plasmid into HEK293T cells. they secrete a factor capable of mediating antiviral activity against multiple viruses. mRNA level relative to GAPDH reached up to 4.8 103 on average. IL-32 stimulates the expression and secretion of an unknown antiviral factor in PBMCs. rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were treated with 5 ng/ml rhIL-32. mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 increased markedly. the relative mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 were analyzed by real time PCR. a, freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy volunteers were treated with 5 ng/ml rhIL-32 or control for 24 h. PBMCs were electroporated with specific shRNA for IL-32 or irrelevant shRNA control and treated with or without 50 mg/ml poly(I-C) the data were normalized to the IgG control at 0 h, and the data were normalized to the IgG control at 0 h. we also assessed the effects of rhIL-32 on IFN-1 expression in different cell lines. we also assessed the effects of rhIL-32 on IFN-1 expression in different cell lines. the results indicated that IFN-1 expression is at least in part dependent on IL-32. IL-32 induces IFN-1 Transcription via an essential cluster of homotypic NF-B binding sites. this cluster binds efficiently to NF-B and functions independently of the IRF binding sites (44). both promoters were constructed into a vector to generate pIFN-1-Luc. IL-32 activated the translocation of p50 and p65 proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus but did not affect IRF3 or IRF7 translocation. luciferase reporter plasmids containing the IFN-1 wild-type promoter or truncation were electroporated into Jurkat cells with pCMV-IL-32 construct or a control vector. IL-32 and IFN-1 expression was elevated in chronic hepatitis B liver biopsies (n = 16) compared with normal liver biopsies (n = 16). IL-32 mRNA levels in PBMCs isolated from HBV patients were significantly elevated compared with healthy individuals. relative IL-32 and IFN-1 mRNA levels in eight HBV-infected liver tissues were measured by real time PCR and subjected to a Pearson correlation analysis. a statistically significant correlation was observed between serum IL-32 and IFN-1 protein levels. miR-29b, IL-32, and IFN-1 levels were detected simultaneously at the indicated time points. results showed that miR-29b levels dropped rapidly within 6 h after the electroporation. synthetic miR-29b or nonsense miRNA was co-electroporated. a large amount of X mRNA is expressed in PBMCs of highly viremic patients. X protein stimulates PBMCs of infected patients and activates the immune response. IL-32 mRNA is highly expressed in immune tissue rather than other tissue. jurkat cells, THP-1 cells, and PBMCs were electroporated with the HBV-expressing plasmid pHBV or an empty vector. data are expressed as OD values (D) IL-32 mRNA levels were analyzed by real time PCR. deletion or mutation of NF-B binding sites had significant effects on the induction of the IL-32 promoter by HBV. cAMP response element site mutation also slightly reduced the HBV-induced promoter activity. hours after transfection, ChIP assays were performed using 5 g of anti-NF-B p65, anti-NF-B RelB, anti-CREB1 or anti-CREB2 antibodies. the medium was removed and replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium. luciferase activities were analyzed at 48 h. changes of miRNA levels in both HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 were detected. miRNAs target the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNAs and regulate expression of numerous genes by catalyzing the cleavage of mRNA (41) or repressing mRNA translation (42). a mutant of the predicted targeting site was generated from the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter plasmid. IL-32 mRNA levels in miR-29b-transfected cells were significantly decreased compared with those in cells transfected with the nonsense miRNA control. transfection with miR-29b inhibitor resulted in up to 2-fold increases in IL-32 mRNA levels compared with controls. a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between IL-32 mRNA and miR-29b in the PBMC samples from HBV patients (n = 17, r = 0.776, p 0.01). the RNA levels were also analyzed with HBV-infected liver tissues (n = 8). relative miR-29b levels were detected at 48 h. PBMCs were isolated from healthy individuals (n = 10) and HBV-infected patients (n = 17) no significant anti-HBV activity was found with IL-32 in vitro. pCMV-IL-32 or vector was transfected into L02, Huh7, and Hep3B cells. 48 hours later, intracellular HBV DNA was measured by real time PCR. the supernatants were collected and used for EV71 copy testing by real time PCR. the transfected cells were incubated with the supernatants in RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. the DMEM was then removed, and the cells were incubated with the supernatants for 48 h. supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs had universal antiviral properties. we transfected the PNL4-3 plasmid into HEK293T cells. rhIL-32-treated PBMCs secrete a factor capable of mediating antiviral activity against multiple viruses. IL-32 inhibits viral DNA, pregenomic RNA, and HBV x (HBx) RNA. mice were treated by hydrodynamic injection of pAAV-HBV1.3 and pCMV-IL-32. blood was taken from fossa orbitalis and used for HBe/sAg measurement. PBMCs of six chronic HBV infectors were also isolated to perform the same experiment. IFN-1 was selectively induced by rhIL-32, although it initially expressed at relatively higher levels in these patients than in healthy individuals. supernatants were harvested at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after electroporation. supernatants were neutralized with IFN-1 Abs (5 g/ml), IFN- Abs (5 g/ml) or control IgG. natant of rhIL-32-treated PBMCs found IFN-1 protein levels were dramatically higher than the control. the average IFN-1 protein concentrations reached up to 165 15 pg/ml. we also assessed the effects of rhIL-32 on IFN-1 expression in different cell lines. the presence of IFN-1 in the supernatant of rhIL-32-treated cells is important for effective antiviral activity. a cluster of homotypic NF-B binding sites has been identified in the distal upstream region of the IFN-1 promoter. mutations in the identified IRF3/7 binding sites, IFN-stimulated response element and positive regulatory domain I, did not affect the IL-32-mediated up-regulation of the promoter. IL-32 promoted the binding of the p65 protein on most NF-B sites within the IFN-1 promoter. IL-32 has been described as an activator of the NF-B signaling pathway (5). normal rabbit IgG was used as a control. Immunoprecipitated DNA or control DNA was collected and amplified. serum IL-32 levels in healthy individuals (n = 10) and chronic HBV-infected patients (n = 174; shown in supplemental Table 5) were compared. D, IFN-1 protein levels in the sera of HBV patients were measured by ELISA. a statistically significant correlation was observed between serum IL-32 and IFN-1 levels. this correlation was also observed among the HBV-infected liver tissues. miR-29b, IL-32, and IFN-1 levels were detected simultaneously. IL-32 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2.2.15 cells were significantly higher than those in HepG2 cells. a large amount of X mRNA is expressed in PBMCs of highly viremic patients. a large amount of X mRNA is expressed in PBMCs of highly viremic patients. IL-32 protein levels in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were analyzed by real time PCR. D\u2013G, Jurkat cells, THP-1 cells, and PBMCs were electroporated with the HBV-expressing plasmid pHBV. cAMP response element sites are important cis-regulatory elements within the IL-32 promoter. five truncation reporter plasmids and four mutant reporter plasmids were constructed. the binding sites of the transcriptional factors were altered or deleted. the induction of luciferase activity was calculated compared with the vector control (-fold change). CRE, cAMP response element. B, Jurkat cells were electroporated with pHBV or an empty vector. luciferase reporter plasmid containing the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR was co-transfected into HepG2 cells with the HBV-expressing plasmid pHBV or a vector control. changes of the expression of four miRNAs caused by HBV in microarray assays were detected. IL-32 mRNA levels were analyzed at 48 h and normalized to the control. nonsense miRNA inhibitor and empty vector were used as controls. miRNAs target the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNAs and regulate expression of numerous genes. miR-29b mimics significantly suppressed the activity of the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter, and miR-29b inhibitor increased this activity. these effects were not observed in cells transfected with the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR mutant construct plasmid (Fig. 3, C and E) the ratio of miR-29b in HepG2.2.15/HepG2 was lower than that in the microarray. we think the difference may come from the different approaches applied in the two experimental systems. relative miR-29b levels in the HBV-positive cell lines were compared with control HepG2 and Huh7 cells. the relative miR-29b levels were detected at 48 h. pCMV-IL-32 or vector was transfected into L02, Huh7, and Hep3B cells. pCMV-IL-32 or vector was transfected with pCMV-IL-32/vector plasmid. no significant anti-HBV activity was found with IL-32 in vitro. d, EV71-infected RD cells were cultured in 6-well plates, washed three times with PBS after medium was removed. the supernatants were collected and used for EV71 copy testing by real time PCR. supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs had universal antiviral properties. replication of EV71 was hampered after incubation with these supernatants. rhIL-32-treated PBMCs secrete a factor capable of mediating antiviral activity against multiple viruses. the index of the empty vector group was lower than the former over 2 orders of magnitude. IL-32 effectively impaired viral DNA, pregenomic RNA, and HBV x (HBx) RNA. the mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 were analyzed by real time PCR. the results showed that IFN-1 mRNA levels increased markedly, reaching a 30-fold increase. PBMCs of six chronic HBV infectors were also isolated. PBMCs were electroporated with specific shRNA for IL-32 or irrelevant shRNA control. relative mRNA levels of IL-32 and IFN-1 were analyzed by real time PCR 24 h after treatment. the results showed that IFN-1 promoter activity was induced significantly by IL-32. however, this induction was not observed for the IFN- promoter. we then detected the IFN-1 protein in the supernatant of rhIL-32-treated PBMCs. supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were incubated with IFN-1 or IFN- neutralization antibody. the anti-IFN-1 antibody abolished the rhIL-32-mediated inhibition of HBV DNA replication and HBe/HBs antigen expression compared with the IgG control. these effects were not observed with anti-IFN- antibody. IL-32 caused a more than 7-fold up-regulation in the longer promoter (1903 bp) and about a 3-fold induction in the shorter promoter (728 bp). cis-regulatory elements (NF-B sites) were essential for IL-32-induced IFN-1 transcription. the induction of IFN-1 (-fold change) was calculated compared with the vector control. Error bars represent S.D. B, PBMCs were treated with rhIL-32 (5 ng/ml) or a vehicle for 24 h. normal rabbit IgG was used as a control. expression was detected by immunohistochemical assays with normal liver biopsies (n = 16) and chronic hepatitis B-infected liver biopsies (n = 16) expression was detected by immunohistochemical assays with normal liver biopsies (n = 16) and chronic hepatitis B-infected liver biopsies (n = 16) were analyzed by real time PCR. recombinant IL-32 can induce IFN-1 in freshly isolated PBMCs. a statistically significant correlation was observed between serum IL-32 and IL-32 levels. this correlation was also observed among the HBV-infected liver tissues. IL-32 expression is induced by HBV in Various Cell Types. levels in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were measured by real time PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. a large amount of X mRNA is expressed in PBMCs of highly viremic patients. IL-32 mRNA levels in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were analyzed by real time PCR. ELISA (B) and Western blot (C) measured IL-32 mRNA levels in supernatants. pG2 cells were used as control. all the IL-32 protein levels are normalized to control. pG2 cells were used as control. IL-32 transcription was induced mainly through NF-B activation. luciferase activity was calculated compared with the vector control (-fold change) the activity of the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter was markedly up-regulated by HBV. we then analyzed the 3\u2032-UTR of IL-32, and specific miRNA recognition sites were identified. luciferase activities were analyzed at 48 h. mutant IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter plasmid was co-transfected into HepG2 cells with miR-29b, the miR-29b inhibitor, or nonsense controls. luciferase activities were analyzed at 48 h and normalized to the control. miR-29b mimics significantly suppressed the activity of the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter. a mutant of the predicted targeting site was generated from the IL-32 3\u2032-UTR reporter plasmid. results showed only miR-29b and its inhibitor significantly affected the UTR reporter activity. miR-29b levels in the HBV-positive cell lines HepG2.2.15 and Huh7.37 (Genotype B) were markedly lower than in the control cell lines. the ratio of miR-29b in HepG2.2.15/HepG2 was lower than that in the microarray. miR-29b levels are suppressed during chronic HBV infection. this suppression contributed to HBV-induced IL-32 expression. relative miR-29b levels were detected at 48 h. natants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs Exhibit Antiviral Activity The antiviral effects of IL-32 have been described in infections with viruses such as influenza, (7), HIV (4,8), herpes simplex virus 2 and vesicular stomatitis virus (10). neither HBV DNA nor HBe/s antigens were altered by transfection with pCMV-IL-32. the intracellular HBV DNA and HBe/sAg were analyzed by real time PCR and ELISA. EV71-infected RD cells were cultured in 6-well plates, washed three times with PBS after medium was removed. the supernatants were then collected and used for EV71 copy testing. supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were treated with different concentrations of rhIL-32. the supernatants from rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were then incubated with pHBV-transfected Hep3B cells. the most effective antiviral activity could be achieved with rhIL-32 concentrations of 5 ng/ml. the addition of pCMV-IL-32 plasmid in the hydrodynamic injection successfully brought about the expression of human IL-32 in mouse livers. IL-32 effectively impaired viral DNA, pregenomic RNA, and HBV x (HBx) RNA. freshly isolated PBMCs were treated with 5 ng/ml rhIL-32. mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 were analyzed by real time PCR. the results showed that IFN-1 mRNA levels increased markedly, reaching a 30-fold increase. pG2, Huh7, Jurkat, and THP-1) were treated with rhIL-32 (5 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 24 h. relative mRNA levels of rhIL-32 and IFN-1 were detected by real time PCR. the results showed that IFN-1 promoter activity was induced significantly by IL-32. however, this induction was not observed for the IFN- promoter. we then detected the IFN-1 protein in the supernatant of rhIL-32-treated PBMCs by ELISA. rhIL-32-treated PBMCs were incubated with IFN-1 or IFN- neutralization antibody. the anti-IFN-1 antibody abolished the rhIL-32-mediated inhibition of HBV DNA replication and HBe/HBs antigen expression compared with the IgG control. s with truncation and site-specific mutants electroporated into Jurkat cells. pCMV-IL-32 caused a more than 7-fold up-regulation in the longer promoter (1903 bp) and about a 3-fold induction in the shorter promoter (728 bp). NF-B site mutations in the proximal region also significantly impaired this induction. luciferase reporter plasmids containing the IFN-1 wild-type promoter or truncation were electroporated into Jurkat cells with the pCMV-IL-32 construct or a control vector. the induction of IFN-1 (-fold change) was calculated compared with the vector control. IL-32 protein was significantly elevated in serum samples from a cohort of HBV patients compared with healthy individuals. expression was detected by immunohistochemical assays with normal liver biopsies and chronic hepatitis B-infected liver biopsies. the relative mRNA levels of IL-32 and IFN-1 were analyzed by real time PCR. CHB, chronic hepatitis B; NC, nonsense control. *, p 0.05; **, p 0.01. Error bars represent S.D. miRNA was co-electroporated along with pHBV-1.3 plasmid into PBMCs. a suppressed level of miR-29b during HBV infection contributes to induction of both IL-32 and IFN-1. a hypothetical model was drawn to show the antiviral role of IL-32 and IFN-1 during chronic HBV infection. the regulation of IL-32 transcription during viral infection has been reported previously (7). the HBx protein has been shown to activate the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling cascade. this protein also induces the phosphorylation of IB, a 3\u20134-fold reduction in IB stability. blockade of type I IFN activity did not effectively inhibit IL-32-medited antiviral function. IL-32 selectively stimulated IFN-1, but not IFN-, expression in PBMCs. this antiviral effect was also effective against HBV, HCV, EV71, and HIV. the induction of the IFN- gene in response to viral infection requires the coordinated activation of the transcription factors NF-B, AP-1, and IRF3/7 (49). this group concluded that IFN-1 gene expression requires NF-B and NF-B activate gene expression independently through spatially separated promoter elements. mRNA levels are positively correlated with IL-32 expression in liver cells. IL-32 induces IL-32 expression via suppressing miR-29b and activating promoter. human IL-32 effectively inhibits HBV replication in an animal model."}
