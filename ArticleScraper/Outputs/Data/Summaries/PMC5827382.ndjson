{"summary": "the current epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas has explosively spilled over to 84 countries worldwide. the current epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas (since 2015) has explosively spilled over to 84 countries worldwide (1), including china (7, 8) progress in vaccine development against ZIKV has been made in multiple platforms. chimpanzee adenoviruses are currently being explored as popular vaccine vectors for multiple pathogens. candidate for a wide range of pathogens, including influenza virus (33, 34), Ebola virus (35, 36), HIV (37), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (38), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (39) promising preclinical results bring this vaccine vector closer to clinical applications. inant AdC7-M/E was cloned into the E1 deletion region of the virus genome. the expression cassette consists of sequences encoding the signal peptide from japanese encephalitis virus (JEVsp) and the full-length M/E glycoproteins of a ZIKV strain from the Asian lineage. 293T cells were infected with AdC7-M/E and stained with monoclonal anti-ZIKV E antibody and 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole. green fluorescence was detected in cytoplasm of the cells infected with AdC7-M/E but not in uninfected cells. titers of serum against the infection of the circulating ZIKV strain (ZIKV-SMGC-1) elicited robust neutralization antibody generation. a single vaccination of AdC7-M/E is sufficient to evoke high levels of anti-ZIKV neutralizing activities. immunodeficient mice lacking type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling have been widely used as a sensitive animal model for ZIKV infection (48) Ifnar1/ mice (n = 4) were immunized with a high or low dose of AdC7-M/E or with PBS as a sham vaccine via the i.m. route. a time course of MN50 titers of neutralizing antibodies was measured. serum generated after infection with the african or african strains could neutralize heterologous ZIKV strains. vaccine consisting of genes from an Asian ZIKV strain can induce protection against heterologous strains, such as MR766. splenocytes were isolated and evaluated for their ability to express gamma interferon (IFN-) after in vitro exposure to peptide pools or live ZIKV. all of the ZIKV M peptide pool, ZIKV E peptide pool and live ZIKV elicited T cells of AdC7-M/E-immunized mice to strongly secrete IFN-. 2.99% 0.66% of E294\u2013302 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells were detected in the splenocytes of AdC7-M/E-immunized mice. these results indicate that AdC7-M/E induces a robust T cell response against both ZIKV M and E antigens. ELISPOT assays were performed to evaluate the ability of splenocytes to secrete IFN- following stimulation with 94\u2013302 tetramer-specific (I) CD8+ T cells are shown. data are means SEM. P values were analyzed with Student's t test (**, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001; ****, P 0.0001). data are means SEM. Protective efficacy for passive immunization with AdC7-M/E. groups of BALB/c donor mice (n = 5) were immunized with a high dose of AdC7-M/E. four weeks postvaccination, mice were euthanized for blood collection. group of vaccinated BALB/c mice (n = 5) received 1.6 1011 vp of AdC7-M/E or PBS as a sham vaccine. at 6 h post-serum transfer, mice were challenged with 1 106 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1. animals were monitored daily for survival and weight loss. all mice vaccinated with either a high or low dose of AdC7-M/E showed no detectable viremia from 0 to 16 dpi. all sham-vaccinated mice (n = 6) developed severe viremia until their deaths. all vaccine-immunized mice (n = 6) survived and had undetectable viral levels up to 16 dpi. a single vaccination of AdC7-M/E was sufficient to elicit sterilizing immunity to eliminate ZIKV viremia and tissue viral loads. at 4 weeks postvaccination, mice were challenged with 5 104 PFU or 5 106 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1. groups of Ifnar1/ mice (n = 4) received a single dose of 1.6 1011 vp of AdC7-M/E or PBS as a sham vaccine. at day 28, mice were infected with a total of 5 104 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1 via i.p. injection. testes from each mouse were harvested at 16 and 30 dpi. sham-vaccinated mice suffered from disruption of normal testicle architecture and loss of seminiferous tubules. the expression of M/E was under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. the recombinant virus AdC7-M/E was rescued in HEK293 cells. 293T cells were infected with AdC7-M/E and stained with monoclonal anti-ZIKV E antibody and 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole. green fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of the cells infected with AdC7-M/E but not in uninfected cells. robust neutralization antibody generation suggests that a single vaccination of AdC7-M/E is sufficient to evoke high levels of anti-ZIKV neutralizing activities. a single vaccination of AdC7-M/E is sufficient to evoke high levels of anti-ZIKV neutralizing activities. single i.m. inoculations of high-dose or low-dose vaccine were performed at week 0 (n = 6) sera were tested for ZIKV E-specific reactivity and neutralizing titers as high as those of the BALB/c mice. a time course of MN50 titers of neutralizing antibodies was measured. a time course of MN50 titers of neutralizing antibodies was measured. a single ZIKV serotype was identified through neutralization studies. d by infection with the African ZIKV strain conferred on rhesus macaques complete protection against heterologous Asian ZIKV. a vaccine consisting of genes from an Asian ZIKV strain can induce protection against heterologous strains, such as MR766. all of the ZIKV M peptide pool, ZIKV E peptide pool, and live ZIKV elicited T cells of AdC7-M/E-immunized mice to strongly secrete IFN- levels. the splenocytes were stimulated with the ZIKV E peptide pool. tetramers consisting of two peptides derived from the ZIKV M (residues 25 Ifnar1/ mice (n = 5) were immunized with 4 1010 vp of AdC7-M/E or with PBS as a sham vaccine via the i.m. route. four weeks postvaccination, splenocytes were isolated. an ICS assay was conducted to quantify the proportion of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells. a challenge study was performed using Ifnar1/ mice as the model. Mice (n = 8) received a high or low dose of AdC7-M/E via the i.m. route. PBS was given as a sham vaccine. groups of BALB/c donor mice (n = 5) were immunized with a high dose of AdC7-M/E or with PBS as a sham vaccine. four weeks postvaccination, mice were euthanized for blood collection. sera from BALB/c mice (200 l per donor mouse) were adoptively transferred to Ifnar1/ mice in a one-to-one infusion manner via i.p. injection. at 6 h post-vaccination, mice were challenged with 1 106 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1. animals were monitored daily for survival and weight loss. all sham-vaccinated mice (n = 6) developed severe viremia until their deaths. all vaccine-immunized mice (n = 6) survived and had undetectable viral levels up to 16 dpi. this result strongly correlated with the high prechallenge MN50 titers induced by AdC7-M/E vaccination. Ifnar1/ mice (n = 6) received a single immunization of 1.6 1011 vp of AdC7-M/E. at 4 weeks postvaccination, mice were challenged with 5 104 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1. group of 5-week-old male mice (n = 4) received a single dose of 1.6 1011 vp of AdC7-M/E or PBS as a sham vaccine. at day 28, mice were infected with a total of 5 104 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1 via i.p. injection. at 16 and 30 dpi, testes were analyzed. images of testis pathology at low magnifications are shown in the top row for each time point (indicated by the panel suffix 1). the boxed areas are shown at higher magnification in the respective bottom images. the rare serotypes rarely circulate in humans. it has been successfully applied to develop vaccines against HIV (37), Ebola (35), and influenza (33, 34). a single vaccine was sufficient to evoke strong and protective immunity. aedes albopictus C6/36 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 28\u00b0C. the MR766 strain of ZIKV was originally obtained from the u.s. CDC. all animal experiments were approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments. an E1- and E3-deleted, replication-deficient AdC7 vector was generated in our laboratory previously (46). the cassette JEVsp-M/E was cloned into the E1 domain of an AdC7 molecular clone, forming a recombinant AdC7-M/E genome. 293T cells were seeded in cell imaging dishes (Eppendorf, Germany) and infected with 1 109 vp of AdC7-M/E. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. 106 PFU of ZIKV-SMGC-1 virus through the i.p. route at 4 weeks postvaccination. mice that had lost 25% of initial body weight were euthanized on animal welfare grounds. the endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give an absorbance greater than 2-fold of the background values. antibody titer below the limit of detection was determined as half the limit of detection.
