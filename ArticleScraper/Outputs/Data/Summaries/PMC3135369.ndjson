{"summary": "IPP-expanded V9V2 T cells could kill human seasonal influenza H1N1/A/Hong Kong/54/98 (human H1N1) and avian influenza H9N2 and H5N1 virus\u2013infected, monocyte-derived macrophages. cytotoxicity of PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells against virus-infected MDMs. PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells were co-cultured with PR/8 virus\u2013infected MDMs at a ratio of 10:1 for 6 h. cytotoxicity was analyzed by flow cytometry as the percentage of EthD-2+ cells in the CD3 population and calculated as the percentage of inhibition relative to those without any treatment. the cytotoxicity of V9V2 T cells against PR/8 virus\u2013infected MDMs was significantly abrogated after CMA treatment or Bcl-2 treatment. the perforin-specific inhibitor concanamycin A (CMA) and the granzyme B inactivator Bcl-2 were used. the percentages of human lymphocyte populations in mouse peripheral blood were comparable to that in huPBMCs before transplantation except the CD4/CD8 ratio was reversed. a booster vaccination of tetanus toxoid (TT) in these mice induced human T and B cell proliferation, TT-specific IFN- secretion in human CD4 and CD8 T cells, and serum anti-TT\u2013specific human antibody in vivo. human H1N1 virus does not cause obvious disease in wild-type and Rag2/c/ mice. however, it did induce mild disease in mice reconstituted with huPBMCs. the data shown as mean SEM are representative of two independent experiments. infected humanized mice were measured at indicated time after infection. body weight changes (n = 8 per group; F), lung viral titers (n = 4 per group; G) and survival (n = 8 per group; H) were measured at indicated time of after infection. the frequency of V9V2 T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes in Rag2/c/ mice increased to a peak level at day 5 and gradually reduced to a basal level at day 15 after infection. a significant increase in human V9V2 T cells was seen in peripheral blood, spleen, and liver, but not in lung. PAM selectively expands human V9V2 T cells in humanized mice. the percentage (mean SEM) of V9V2 T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes in humanized mice. mice were infected with PR/8 virus i.n. and treated with PAM or PBS i.p from day 3 after infection. treatment with PAM significantly decreased weight loss and mortality in humanized mice. in humanized mice infected with human seasonal H1N1, PAM treatment began on day 3 after infection completely prevented weight loss. the effect of PAM on mortality could not be investigated. no V9V2 T cells were seen in lungs of uninfected mice. reconstituted huPBMCs may provide some protection during early stage of infection. reconstituted huPBMCs can effectively reduce influenza disease severity and mortality caused by human H1N1, PR/8 and avian H5N1 viruses. avian H5N1 virus induced higher levels of human IL-6, TNF, and IP-10 and murine IL-6 and RANTES in humanized mice. PAM treatment significantly reduced levels of human IL-10, IL-10, TNF, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 in the lungs of human H1N1 virus\u2013infected mice at day 10 after infection. the levels of human proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined at the indicated times after infection (A and B) the data are shown as mean SEM. *, P 0.05. V9V2 T cell\u2013depleted huPBMCs were obtained after double depletions. rats were transplanted with 30 106 of huPBMCs or V9V2 T cell-depleted huPBMCs. lytic activities during the co-culture of PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells with influenza H1N1/A/PR/8/34 (PR/8) virus\u2013infected, autologous MDMs. the cells showed potent cytotoxicity against PR/8 H1N1 virus\u2013infected MDMs. PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells were co-cultured with PR/8 virus\u2013infected MDMs at a ratio of 10:1 for 6 h. perforin inhibitor CMA, granzyme B inactivator Bcl-2, anti-NKG2D (aNKG2D), anti-TRAIL (aTRAIL), anti-FasL (aFasL) blocking antibodies, or their relevant isotype controls, were used. cytotoxicity of V9V2 T cells is dependent on NKG2D activation. human lymphocytes had stably engrafted in Rag2/c/ mice by 4 wk after transplantation. this stable engraftment was maintained for up to 60 wk. chimeric Rag2/c/ mice with functional human T and B cells after 4 wk of huPBMC transplantation are used for following experiments and referred to as \u201chumanized\u201d mice. the data are representative of four independent experiments. mice reconstituted with V9V2 T cell\u2013depleted huPBMCs. evidence of 5\u201310% weight loss from day 6 after infection. body weight changes in wild-type and Rag2/c/ mice after infection with human H1N1 virus or mock. highly purified (>97%) PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells were adoptively transferred into influenza PR/8 virus\u2013infected mice i.v. at day 2, 4, and 6 after infection. frequency of V9V2 T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes in humanized mice increased to a peak level at day 5, and then gradually reduced to a basal level at day 15 after infection. a significant increase in human V9V2 T cells was seen in peripheral blood, spleen, and liver, but not in lung. a significant increase in human V9V2 T cells was seen in peripheral blood, spleen, and liver, but not in lung. humanized mice were infected with PR/8 virus i.n. and injected with PAM or PBS i.p from day 3 after infection. treatment with PAM significantly decreased weight loss and mortality in humanized mice. humanized mice were infected with human H1N1 virus and treated with PAM or PBS on day 3, 5, 7, and 9 after infection. body weight changes and survival (C; n = 6 per group; n = 6 per group; B) are shown. treatment with PAM from day 1 after infection significantly reduced weight loss and mortality caused by avian influenza H5N1/A/Hong Kong/486/97 (avian H5N1) virus. more V9V2 T cells accumulated in avian H5N1 virus\u2013infected lung. PAM treatment significantly suppressed replication of human seasonal H1N1 virus in the lung from day 6 onwards. avian H5N1 virus induced higher levels of human IL-6, TNF, and IP-10 and murine IL-6 and RANTES in the lungs of humanized mice. murine IL-6, IL-10, TNF, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 significantly decreased levels of human IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 in the lungs of human H1N1 virus\u2013infected humanized mice on day 10 after infection. fewer inflammatory human lymphocyte (i.e., CD3) infiltrates and less pathology in the lungs of human H1N1 or avian H5 infected humanized mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. data are representative of three independent experiments. treatment with PAM significantly decreased weight loss and mortality. humanized mice reconstituted with whole huPBMCs (PBMC) or V9V2 T cell\u2013depleted huPBMCs (PBMC--T) were infected with PR/8 virus, and treated with PAM or PBS on day 3, 5, 7 and 9 after infection. the body weight change and survival in virus-infected humanized mice are shown. humanized mice are suitable for the study of human V9V2 T cell immune responses to influenza viruses. -T cells play critical roles in the defense against infectious pathogens and in tumors. demonstrate for the first time that V9V2 T cells can directly inhibit viral replication and control influenza disease in vivo. this is the first demonstration of the therapeutic effect of PAM on influenza infections. phosphoantigen-expanded V9V2 T cells only suppressed human H1N1 virus replication, but did not affect avian H5N1 viral replication in vitro. we also found that PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells in vivo migrated to influenza virus\u2013infected lungs of humanized mice. the lack of a beneficial effect of PAM in influenza virus\u2013infected Rag2/c/ mice excludes the possibility that this drug has we found that mice reconstituted with whole huPBMCs showed similar disease severity. this is probably because the effector functions of V9V2 T cells are dependent on their numbers and the degree of activation. in vitro results showed that influenza virus alone could not expand V9V2 T cells. different strains of influenza virus cause varying disease severity in humanized mice. avian H5N1 virus induced more severe illness, pulmonary pathology, and even death in humanized mice. it is not clear whether the proinflammatory cytokine induction is simply a reflection of the enhanced H5N1 viral replication. human seasonal H1N1 virus could infect both human and mouse cells in the lung in humanized mice. the process of humanization may alter the lung tissue tropism for influenza virus in mice. the significance of targeting V9V2 T cells rather than the influenza virus itself lies in their innatelike effector functions.
