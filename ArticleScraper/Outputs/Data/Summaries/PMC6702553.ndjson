{"summary": "the seroprevalence study was done from the random sampling (n=1000) of blood collected from 29 dual-purpose herds in three municipalities. the presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a major cause of economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. most important viral agent include bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) the state has a population of 1,305,984 heads of cattle, being 30% located in the three municipalities. the study was conducted between January and April 2017 in the municipalities of Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria in the department of Cesar, Colombia. twenty-nine dual-purpose herds were randomly selected according to the base of vaccination records of the three municipalities. according to ICA [13], the cattle population census for the three municipalities was 391,000 heads. serological analysis Serum samples were analyzed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. results were read in a microplate photometer, where the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. the cutoff was calculated as A = OD (corrected negative control) bioclimatic characteristics of the region are a mean annual temperature of 28\u00b0C, with little weather variation along the year. altitude is 65 to 800 masl and mean annual rainfall is 1835 mm, with well-defined dry and wet periods [21]. none of the cattle herds were vaccinated against BHV-1, BRSV, BVDV, and BPI-3. other data gathered in the questionnaire included: municipality, herd size, clinical signs, age group of the animal, and to sex, i.e. male and females. BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V were 98.6%, 94.7%, and 47.1% respectively. the seroprevalence for BVDV is present in different proportions in the three municipalities of the Cesar department, Colombia. bPI-3V=Bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, SP=Seroprevalence, BVDV=Bovine viral diarrhea virus, BRSV=Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, BHV-1=Bovine herpesvirus type1 Table-2 shows the comparison between positive percent for BHV-1 and the age of the animals. ovine viral diarrhea virus, BRSV=Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, BHV-1=Bovine herpesvirus type 1 Table-3 shows the frequency of clinical signs observed in the tested animals. the retention of placenta presented the highest frequency (75.1%), followed by abortion (56.8%), fever (56.8%), and diarrhea (55.7%). p=0.7 (0.2); p=0.6 (1.1); p=0.3 (1.4); p=0.2 (1.1); p=0.3 (0.03); p=0.8 (58.1); p=0.00 No Diarrhea 55.7 Yes (1.6); p=0.2 (3.1); p=0.08 (2.0); p=0.1 (94.1); p=0.00 No Conjunctivitis 38.5 Yes (0.01); p=0.9 (1.7); p=0.01 (47.2 La Gloria and Rio de Oro municipalities showed 3.5 and 3.2 times higher probability of infection for BVDV than Aguachica municipality. there was no statistical significance between the pathogens with respect to the herd size (p>0.05). BRSV Our results revealed high BRSV seroprevalence (98.6%) in the three explored municipalities that indicate most adult cattle have been exposed to this pathogen. this is the first epidemiological study on viral pathogens carried out in the department of Cesar, Colombia, to determinate seroprevalence. results differ from those published by Carbonero et al. [24] who reported 46.6% of seroprevalence in Argentina. results demonstrate that BRSV is widespread among animals and dual-purpose cattle herds in Cesar department. BVDV BVDV has been reported to be the virus most commonly isolated from pneumonic lungs of cattle. the pathogens have a global distribution and impacts the respiratory and reproductive performance of the animals, resulting in significant financial losses. the variation of seroprevalence in different regions may be due to differences in cattle population age, cattle density, herd size, housing systems, biosecurity, disease control measures, and type of breeding of the animals. in our study, the similar seroprevalence of BVDV observed between the two age groups suggests the dissemination of persistently infected animals. BVDV causes diarrhea, enteritis, and atrophy of the intestinal villi. but it is not possible to explain the statistical association found in this study because other causes inducing diarrhea and fever in animals were not studied. BHV-1 Our results in Table-1 demonstrate a high level of exposure to this virus in the municipalities studied with seroprevalence of 94.7%. these results agree with those by Betancur et al. [8] who reported high values of seroprevalence for BHV-1 in herds of Monteria municipality, Colombia. however, these results differ with those by Ochoa et al. and [9] Guarino et al. [38] who the distribution of virus and risk factors identification is important to establish prevention and control programs against economically important diseases such as BPI-3V, BRSV, BVDV, and BHV-1. the individual seroprevalence of BRSV (98.6%) agrees with the findings of Saa et al. [18] who reported 80.4% of seroprevalence in herds of Ecuador. several herds in Colombia are not being vaccinated against BRSV. BRSV is widespread among animals and dual-purpose cattle herds. BVDV BVDV has been reported to be the virus most commonly isolated from pneumonic lungs of cattle. this pathogens has a global distribution and impacts the respiratory and reproductive performance of the animals, resulting in significant financial losses. three hundred and fifty-two (35.2%) of the 1000 serum samples were positive for BVDV antibody (Table-1). corro et al. and Segura-Correa et al. reported higher seroprevalence values in animals older than 24 months of age. in this study, sex, age, and herd size were not a significant risk factor. there was a high frequency in cattle having a previous history of retention of placenta. our results show high BPI-3V seroprevalence (47.1%) in the three explored municipalities that indicate most adult cattle have been exposed to this pathogen. these results agree with those by carbonero et al. [14] who found high seroprevalence values in cattle of Yucatan, Mexico. but the results obtained in this study differ with those published by Betancur et al. [12] who reported lower seroprevalence values (13.5%) in cattle from Monteria, Colombia vulvovaginitis had a statistical association with the BHV-1 seroprevalence values. sex and age were significant risk factors for the viral infection. the age wise seroprevalence to BHV-1 infection denoted that there was an increase in the occurrence of the infection as age advances. authors\u2019 contributions AS and DO conceived and designed the research. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
