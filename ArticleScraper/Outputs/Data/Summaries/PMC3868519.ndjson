{"summary": "systemic upregulation of inflammatory cytokines is characteristic of critical severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) with pulmonary edema. immunomodulatory medicines such as steroids, including methylprednisolone, have been proposed to treat patients with severe HFMD in china. EV71 is an infectious disease caused by enteroviruses including enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16. HFMD affects mainly young children under 5 years old. systemic levels of IFN-induced protein (IP)-10, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and CXCL9 are also significantly higher in patients with PE than in those with uncomplicated BE [15], [17]. the serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- are generally higher in CNS-complicated patients than in patients with uncomplicated HFMD or healthy controls. glucocorticoids have been widely used in the management of severe HFMD with CNS complications in china [23]\u2013[26]. despite the controversy on the rationale and benefits of glucocorticoid therapy in severe enterovirus infection or other viral infections, little is known so far about the immunomodulatory effects and clinical benefits of glucocorticoid treatment in HFMD patients. negative results on Gram stain smear, and signs of fever, vomiting, headache, irritability, and meningeal signs. study subjects and serum samples prospectively enrolled 20 HFMD cases with CNS-involvement. children were hospitalized solely for HFMD within 4 days after disease onset. HFMD was characterized by the manifestation of oral ulcers/vesicular plus vesicular rash on the hands, feet, or/and buttocks. aseptic meningitis was defined as disturbed consciousness plus CSF pleocytosis (>10106 leukocytes/L) or presence of focal neurologic signs. enrolled 20 HFMD cases with CNS-involvement and 20 HFMD cases without CNS- involvement in late July\u2013September, 2010. children were hospitalized solely for HFMD within 4 days after disease onset; children were 5 years old; 3) children's parents gave informed consent to participate in this study; 5) severe HFMD cases were confirmed based on the clinical presentation and the abnormal findings of cerebral spinal fluids. the age of the 20 patients with uncomplicated HFMD was between 11 and 56 months (mean age: 37.6 months) with a male-to-female ratio of 191. the age of the 20 patients with uncomplicated HFMD was between 8 and 47 months (mean age: 29.0 months) Mild CNS-complicated Characteristics (n = 20) (n = 20) (p value EV71 infection 55% (11/20) 95% (19/20) 0.01a Median age, (months) (range) 26.50 (8\u201347) 29.00 (11\u201356) 0.4689 Gender (female/male) 1/19 7/13 0.05a Time of illness at sampling, (day) (range) 1.9 (0\u20134) 2.0 (0\u20136) 0.9367 Median the expression levels of 24 biomarkers in HFMD patients were not significantly different from those of control patients.

IL-1Ra, IL-8, IL-16, PDGF-, VEGF, MIP-1, CTACK (CCL27), GRO (CXCL1), M-CSF, SCGF-, VCAM-1, and MIF were 2\u20133-fold lower in HFMD patients. methylprednisolone treatment did not significantly affect the expression of HFMD-characteristic biomarkers. 13 patients received at least one dose of methylprednisolone 12 hours prior to blood sampling. none of HFMD-characteristic inflammatory biomarkers in the treated patients significantly differed from those in the untreated patients. IL-17A levels in serum samples obtained from untreated (n = 27) or MP-treated HFMD patients (n = 13) soluble receptors differed between patients with HFMD and control patients without HFMD. increased expression levels of IL-6, IFN-, and TNF- in HFMD patients are consistent with previous studies by others [15], [17], [32]. significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines were found in fatal PE patients but not in severe patients without PE [16], [18], [19]. however, the change of some biomarkers, like IL-1Ra [33], may indicate the poor prognosis of HFMD patients. even the relatively mild HFMD patients without complications had significantly more neutrophils and fewer lymphocytes than the control group. methylprednisolone is a cytokine that plays a pathogenic role in CNS-related inflammation, such as multiple sclerosis. methylprednisolone has been recommended to treat critical severe patients who were infected with H5N1 influenza virus, SARS coronarvirus or pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [20], [36], [37]. steroid treatment significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 in patients infected a large cohort with various CNS complications will likely overcome the limitations. supporting information checklist S1 STROBE Statement."}
