{"summary": "Introduction Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in April 2012. since 6 august 2015, 1408 cases of MERS (including 547 deaths) were reported by local health authorities worldwide, and 1064 were from Saudi Arabia. bibliometrics has been utilized for evaluating scientific output and the importance of scientific studies. the data was double-checked by the second reviewer. it was used to obtain: (a) the contributions of countries, organizations and individuals to MERS research between 2013 and 2015. results We used the Kruskal Wallis Test for IF and a two-tailed probability in statistical tests. results A systematic search for MERS publication retrieved 926 articles in PubMed, leaving 924 articles. the retrieved articles were from 40 countries, of which USA ranked first, followed by China and Saudi Arabia in that order. the articles published in these three countries far outnumbered the others. the three most productive organizations were the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, the University of Hong Kong in China, and the University of Bonn in Germany. more than half of the research output came from universities, followed by research organizations (10%), others (9.5%), hospitals (8.5%), government departments (6.3%) and CDCs (3.2%). the differences between the three categories in the three years were statistically significant (X2 = 23.849, p = 0.000) the difference between the three categories in the three years was statistically significant (X2 = 23.849, p = 0.000) 116 articles were identified as covering prevention and control. the minimum IF was 0.59, the maximum 55.87, and the median 5.99. the difference in the IF mean ranks between the four types was not statistically significant. researchers from as many as 40 countries have engaged in research on MERS, implying that MERS has become a global public health concern. among the 40 countries, the US was the most productive, followed by China and Saudi Arabia. most productive organizations were found to be universities, which are understandably the most active and strong in scientific research. the most productive author was not from a university, as Z.A. Memish from the Ministry of Health for Public Health in Saudi Arabia outnumbered all others. a large majority of the articles on prevention and control were published in highly cited specialized journals. the terms 'coronavirus' and 'transmission' were found to be the most frequently used. the proportion of the articles on prevention and control was lower than that on basic medical sciences and clinical studies and others."}
