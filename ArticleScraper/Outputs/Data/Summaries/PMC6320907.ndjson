{"summary": "the japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the main pathogen that causes severe encephalitis in humans. the virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. it is reported that there are 69,000 cases of JEV infection per year. 80% of cases of the JEV infection occur in areas covered by the JEV vaccination program due to the failure of immunization strategies or the limitation of vaccines themselves. in the past 30 years, only six agents for the treatment of JEV have been tested by clinical trials, but none of them have been found effective. drug repurposing has recently become a very popular method for drug discovery. system biology has been used to identify pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases by integrating genetic variation, genomics, pathways, and molecular networks. the advent of systems biology provides a powerful method for facilitating drug development and drug repurposing. gene expression data could reveal the relationship between genes and JEV infection. we resorted to the Gene Expression Omnibus gene expression datasets following JEV infection to identify the JEV-susceptible genes. tases (OAS) family (OAS1, OAS2 and OASL) inhibited the replication of JEV in PK-15 cells in one previous study. the members of the tripartite-motif containing protein were reported to be a negative regulator of IFN- during JEV infection. the results suggested that the genes identified by the GeneRank algorithm may play critical roles in the lifecycle of JEV. GO enrichment analysis (biological processes) and a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis are presented. the top 20 of the GO and pathways were significantly enriched. p. adjust-value 1 108) are presented. the inhibitors of TNF (such as lenalidomide and adalimumab) may also have a potential effect on the treatment of JEV infection. the drugs identified by targeting top 1% of genes with the GeneRank calculation may be effective in the treatment of JEV infection. the hotNet2 algorithm is based on a heat diffusion kernel algorithm that considers the heats of individual genes as well as the topology of gene-gene interactions. we mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phenome-wide association study data to genes to identify potential genes associated with encephalitis. ADAR in the subnetwork was reported to inhibit hepatitis C virus replication through eliminating HCV RNA by adenosine to inosine editing. these results confirmed that the genes identified by the HotNet2 algorithm were important in JEV infection. the genes marked by yellow belong to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) interferon beta-1A and interferon beta-1B belong to interferon-I (IFN-I) family. interferon beta-1A and interferon beta-1B belong to interferon-I (IFN-I) family. interferon beta-1A and interferon beta-1B have antiviral activity. vitamin, can bind to the N protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) it is feasible to tag antiviral agents with biotin to improve antiviral activity. antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and clavulanate, were also found in our results. the mortality rate of the bortezomib-treated infected group was 40%. all of the mice in the bortezomib and PBS groups survived until the end of the experiment. bortezomib has the ability to protect mice from death. fected mice showed different behavior than noninfected mice. the clinical behavior of the bortezomib-treated infected group was alleviated. the mice in the bortezomib and PBS groups did not show any alterations in behavior. gene expression data could reveal the relationship between genes and JEV infection. we resorted to the gene expression Omnibus (GEO)-contained gene expression datasets following JEV infection to identify the genes associated with JEV infection. gene family (OAS1, OAS2 and OASL) inhibited the replication of JEV in PK-15 cells in one previous study [18]. the members of the tripartite-motif containing protein were reported to be a negative regulator of IFN- during JEV infection and to inhibit JEV replication by degrading the viral protein in some other studies [19,20]. the top 20 of the GO and pathways in that the up- and downregulated genes were significantly enriched, respectively. the top 20 of the GO and pathways were significantly enriched, respectively. the inhibitors of TNF (such as lenalidomide and adalimumab) may also have a potential effect on the treatment of JEV infection. the drugs identified by targeting the top 1% of genes with the GeneRank calculation may be effective in the treatment of JEV infection. the hotNet2 algorithm is based on a heat diffusion kernel algorithm that considers the heats of individual genes as well as the topology of gene-gene interactions. to further screen genes for JEV infection, we applied the HotNet2 algorithm to identify the genes that may contribute to encephalitis. the protein ADAR in the subnetwork was reported to inhibit hepatitis C virus replication through eliminating HCV RNA by adenosine to inosine editing. these results confirmed that the genes identified by the HotNet2 algorithm were important in JEV infection. the genes marked by yellow belong to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) interferon beta-1A and interferon beta-1B belong to interferon-I (IFN-I) family. interferon beta-1A and interferon beta-1B have antiviral activity. doxorubicin, a broad-spectrum anticancer activity, suppresses EBOV replication in vitro. biotin is widely used to bind compounds or proteins to trace PEDV. it is feasible to tag antiviral agents with biotin to improve the antiviral activity. also, antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and clavulanate, were also found in our results. the mortality rate of the bortezomib-treated infected group was 40%. all mice in the bortezomib and PBS groups survived until the end of the experiment. bortezomib has the ability to protect mice from death caused by JEV infection. mice in the bortezomib and PBS groups did not show any alterations in behavior. bortezomib treatment prevented the infected mice from pain. bortezomib has the potential to alleviate the suffering caused by JEV infection. bortezomib may be a potential agent for the treatment of JEV infection by targeting these genes. bortezomib may be a potential agent for the treatment of JEV infection by targeting these genes. clinical symptoms and a 30% reduction in mortality caused by JEV were observed, compared with the mortality of untreated mice. these results further support the application of host-targeted approaches for new antiviral agents. r j n = ( 1 d) e x j + d i = 1 N w i j r i n 1 deg i (1) where the importance of gene j and i after n or n 1 iterations is represented by r j n and r i n 1 respectively. the initial importance of gene j is represented by e x j, e x j is defined as the fold change p-values of encephalitis derived from PheWAS data as heat scores in hotNet2 algorithm. agents and Virus Bortezomib (PS-341, powder) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. mice were treated with bortezomib or with PBS with 2% DMSO and 30% PEG 300. mice were treated with bortezomib once every day for the first two days. brains were used for subsequent H&E staining. the protein-protein interaction network used in the GeneRank algorithm was derived from the STRING database. information about the association between chemical agents and its targets was obtained from the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, http://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu/), and the DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/). d (0 d 1) is a constant representing the proportion of PPI network in calculation. the greater d is, the more important PPI network is. in this study, we set the value of d to 0.5. 4.3. mice were randomly divided into four groups: a PBS group (PBS, n = 15); a bortezomib-treated group (bortezomib, n = 15); a JEV-infected and bortezomib-treated group (JEV-bortezomib, n = 15) mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 L PBS. affin sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin for pathological analysis. Cytoscape 3.6.1 was used to visualize subnetworks."}
