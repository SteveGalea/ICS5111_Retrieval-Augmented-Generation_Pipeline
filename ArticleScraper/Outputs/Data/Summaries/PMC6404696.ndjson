{"summary": "pertussis, a Gram-negative bacterium, travels via respiratory droplets infecting human hosts. worldwide epidemics have occurred throughout history, prompting study and control measures. however, even in vaccinated populations, pertussis demonstrates periodic outbreaks. pertussis is known as the \"100-day cough\" in china. young infants may initially be afebrile with mild symptoms that rapidly progress to respiratory distress/apnea, hypoxia or seizures. geal cultures, polymerase chain reaction testing and serologic studies are available to confirm an infection with Bordetella pertussis. these tests offer varying levels of sensitivity and may not be obtainable in a timely fashion to confirm cases in the acute setting. other laboratory studies, such as a complete blood count (CBC), may be helpful in distinguishing causes for cough, but only in certain age groups. pertussis travels from human to human via respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze. patients who have not yet started or completed the initial vaccine series are at greatest risk of becoming infected. bronchiolitis (respiratory syncytial virus) or adenovirus in the differential diagnosis for children. nearly all fatal cases of pertussis present with an extreme leukocytosis with lymphocytosis. obtaining a CBC may be helpful to distinguish between causes of cough in pediatric patients; its utility remains limited. treatment includes a 5\u201314 day course of a macrolide, with the treatment duration dependent on the macrolide chosen. candidates for pertussis post-exposure prophylaxis should receive antimicrobial treatment within 21 days of cough onset. PCR testing and serologic studies are available to confirm an infection with Bordetella pertussis. these tests offer varying levels of sensitivity and may not be obtainable in a timely fashion to confirm cases in the acute setting. other laboratory studies may be helpful in distinguishing causes for cough, but only in certain age groups. transmission and Personal Protective Equipment Pertussis travels from human to human via respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze. patients who have not yet started or completed the initial vaccine series are at greatest risk of becoming infected. in infants nearly all fatal cases of pertussis present with an extreme leukocytosis with lymphocytosis. obtaining a CBC may be helpful to distinguish between causes of cough in pediatric patients. foreign body aspiration is also possible in patients presenting with cough and is sometimes associated with cyanosis. treatment includes a 5\u201314 day course of a macrolide, with the treatment duration dependent on the macrolide chosen. candidates for pertussis post-exposure prophylaxis should receive antimicrobial treatment within 21 days of cough onset in the index patient Infants women in their third trimester of pregnancy. patients are considered most contagious three weeks after the onset of the paroxysmal phase, where coughing spells are most prevalent. patients are considered infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage until three weeks after the onset of the paroxysmal phase. nasopharyngeal cultures, PCR testing and/or serologic studies should be performed. if the cough has been present for between two and four weeks, culture becomes less reliable. serology measures pertussis antibodies, and these levels may be affected by stage of the disease and vaccination status. department.29 Clinicians should notify their local public health agency of any cases of suspected pertussis. this may include patients with paroxysms of cough, the classic inspiratory \"whoop,\" post-tussive emesis and/or apnea (for infants less than one year old). 29 Laboratories who identify confirmatory tests for pertussis should also report to local public health authorities. the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children with pertussis refrain from attending school until they have completed five days of antibiotic treatment. the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children with pertussis refrain from attending school until they have completed five days of antibiotic treatment. if the cough has been present for between two and four weeks, culture becomes less reliable. serology measures pertussis antibodies and these levels may be affected by stage of the disease and vaccination status. 29 Laboratories who identify confirmatory tests for pertussis should also report to local public health authorities. this information will then be shared with the CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)"}
