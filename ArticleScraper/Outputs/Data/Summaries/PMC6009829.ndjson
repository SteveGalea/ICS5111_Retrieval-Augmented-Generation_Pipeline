{"summary": "supplementary information The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nmeth.4340) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. Supplementary information Integrated supplementary information Supplementary Figure 1. the torsional RMSd of 3-residue (b) and 5-residue (c) fragments for one benchmark case (VP6) shows that even though the larger fragments may yield reasonable models overall, the fragment accuracy is significantly reduced with 5-residue fragments, likely making ensemble filtering less accurate. a. RosettaES begins with an incomplete model placed into a density map. b. Short fragments are used to grow an ensemble of partial solutions. d. the remaining structures in the ensemble are again grown with short fragments. we plot model error (y axis) as a function of the maximum ensemble pool size (x axis) for one case from our benchmark (a 48-residue segment from FrhG) in general (excepting some odd behavior at low pool sizes), model accuracy improves as the maximum ensemble size increases.
