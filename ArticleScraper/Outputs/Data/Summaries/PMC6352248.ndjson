{"summary": "swimming pools have been implicated in the transmission of infections. failure in disinfection has been recorded as the main cause of many of the outbreaks associated with swimming pools. the majority of reported viral outbreaks have been caused by enteric viruses. samples were taken after hyperchlorination of the pool 1973 [14] 105 HAdV 3 Georgia Not tested 1977 [15] 72 HAdV 4 Georgia Yes. first swimming-pool related outbreak in which AdV was recovered from water samples 1977 [16] 77 HAdV 7a Oklahoma Not tested 1982 [17] 80 Unknow Greece Yes. identical sequence was detected in both patient stool and pool water 2001 [34] 36 - Minnesota Not known 2001\u20132002 [29] 53 - Vermont Not tested 2004 [35] 18 - Wisconsin Not known 2006 [36] 3. HAdVs are the enteric viruses most commonly associated with swimming pool-related outbreaks. between 25% and 50% of children swimming in the pool were affected. the transmission apparently occurred either by contact with contaminated objects, such as toys, or while swimming in a pool. the water was heavily chlorinated, with residual chlorine close to 0.4 parts per million. pharyngoconjunctival fever (45 cases) in two swimming teams in 1966. most of the infected children had fever, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea. adenovirus type 3 was the etiological agent. in 1977, two outbreaks associated with swimming pools occurred in Georgia, USA. the first, due to HAdV type 3, involved at least 105 cases. a private swimming pool was the source of infection. five HAdV outbreaks associated with swimming were recorded in the 2000s. in the year 2000, an outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever occurred in north Queensland, Australia, where 34 children got sick. in 2011, children (4\u20139 years old) who had attended a swimming training center in eastern china showed symptoms of pharyngoconjunctival fever. 134 cases were confirmed from among 900 amateur swimmers, with an incidence of 14.9%. adenovirus type 3 was recognized as the etiological agent. enterovirus is a genus in the family Picornaviridae, consisting of four human enterovirus species. a number of reports have described enterovirus infections linked to swimming pools. the first enterovirus swimming pool-related outbreak occurred in 1987. twenty children had meningitis-like symptoms (fever, headache, and vomiting), and six were hospitalized. other 48 children had respiratory symptoms consistent with enterovirus infection. an outbreak involving 90 children occurred following a summer camp in 2001. hepatitis a Virus Outbreaks (N\u00b0 = 3) is a virus causing mild to severe liver disease. there are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A every year. the virus is transmitted via the fecal/oral route. norovirus Outbreaks (N\u00b0 = 7) are small viruses within the family Caliciviridae. they are subdivided into at least seven genogroups (GI\u2013VII) they are recognized as a major cause of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis in both industrialized and non-industrialized countries. the pool was heavily contaminated with human fecal material carried from public toilets. the pool had been manually chlorinated three times per week, thus not continuously. in 2002, a noV outbreak associated with a swimming pool was reported in Minnesota, USA. HAdVs were found in 62.5% (10/16) of amoebae with DNA copies up to 5.1 105 per milliliter. the first swimming pool-related outbreak, published in 1953, described a 1951 outbreak in Greeley, Colorado. between 25% and 50% of children swimming in the pool were affected. in 1955, 112 cases of pharyngoconjunctival fever occurred in Toronto. only one case had no history of either swimming or direct contact. most of the children had pharyngitis, fever, malaise, and muscle pain. in adults, symptoms were milder, with a high incidence of conjunctivitis. the attack rate was 65% and 67% for the two teams. the infection was shown to spread in families having index cases (20 infected contacts) an outbreak of pharyngitis caused by HAdV type 7a was recorded in 1982 among 77 children attending a swimming pool. symptoms included conjunctivitis, fever, sore throat, headache, and abdominal pain. two cases were hospitalized with dehydration from persistent vomiting. an outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever affecting 59 children under 15 was recorded in a municipality of northern Spain in July 2008. forty-three cases were recognized as primary cases, all of whom attended a municipal swimming pool. electrical failures causing the intermittent breakdown of the pool\u2019s bromine dosing pumps were assumed to have been the cause. thoat swabs of affected students tested for influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza types 1\u20134 and herpes simplex virus. samples were found positive only for HAdV type 7. enterovirus was suggested as a likely etiological agent based on clinical manifestations, course of disease, incubation time, and the exclusion of likely bacterial pathogens. an enterovirus outbreak occurred in 1992, with 46 cases experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, and headache after swimming in a pool in a small seaside village. swimming in a public, nature-like pond was identified as a risk factor for disease. a total of 215 cases of aseptic meningitis were recorded from July to October 2001. a total of 215 cases of aseptic meningitis were recorded from July to October 2001. children swam in a pool at a summer camp. the pool was a non-chlorinated thermal pool/spa. crowding and poor hygienic conditions, with a suspected accidental fecal release, contributed to the outbreak. in 1977, an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis with the typical symptoms of vomiting, cramping, nausea and diarrhea was documented among 103 students and teachers at a primary school in Ohio, USA. the first cases were caused by swimming in a contaminated pool, and a person-to-person transmission followed. a large outbreak of gastroenteritis due to noVs was recorded in July 2001 in Helsinki. a limited number of studies examined the extent of viral contamination in swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions. two enteroviruses (echovirus 3 and echovirus 11) were identified from two chlorinated pools. the same echovirus strains were found to be present in raw sewage sampled at the Albany treatment plant. enteroviruses were found in 10/14 (71%) of the examined samples. coxsackieviruses B3 and B4, poliovirus 1 and echovirus 7 were isolated in pool waters. no correlation was found with total coliform bacteria. 126 samples were obtained from swimming pools located in five major cities. HAdVs and enteroviruses were identified in four swimming pools. the study was the first to examine the occurrence of non-enteric viruses in swimming pool waters. adenovirus, norovirus and enterovirus were detected in 25% of the analyzed samples. two samples were positive for adenovirus (type 41) and three samples for norovirus GII (type GII.4) the most commonly reported symptoms were gastroenteritis, respiratory symptoms, and conjunctivitis. more severe symptoms were documented, however, including hepatitis and central nervous system infections (aseptic meningitis)."}
