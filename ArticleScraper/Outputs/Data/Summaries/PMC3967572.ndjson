{"summary": "china made huge investments to improve surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capacity and strengthen public health institutions. the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China\u2019s early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans. the early stages of the SARS epidemic went largely unnoticed. many clinicians were unaware of the epidemic threat posed by the pneumonia. cases went undetected because of poor surveillance and inadequate network of clinical laboratories. we compared the chronology of A(H7N9)-related events and responses with the level of A(H7N9)-related public attention. the latter variable was evaluated using Sina Weibo (SINA Corp., Shanghai, China), which is the largest social media network in China. china\u2019s national health and family planning commission and WHO remain concerned about the threat posed by the A(H7N9) virus. it is an avian virus that seems to have recently infected humans, causes serious disease in humans and has genetic characteristics that indicate that it has enhanced capacity for mammalian infection. it remains unclear if A(H7N9) is common in poultry. the viral genomic sequences from the first three known human cases of A(H7N9) infection were published via the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data. on the following day, the national health and family planning Commission enhanced surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology and influenza-like illnesses across china. two days later, molecular diagnostic kits were distributed to the National Veterinary Services, the laboratories in provincial Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and clinical pathology laboratories in major hospitals. new cases of human infection and the type and collection site of each A(H7N9)-positive animal sample were promptly reported on official websites. there was an initial delay in the collection and sharing of the detailed information needed to evaluate the risks of human-to-human transmission accurately and determine the medical conditions of patients with symptomatic A(H7N9) infections. china's prompt communication and collaboration with WHO in assessing and responding to human infections with the novel influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013 should be perceived as one of the major returns on the investment that China has made in public health since the SARS epidemic in 2003. health authorities can help build trust in governments, public health workers and the public. use of social networks to monitor public interest in a health threat. some major events during the outbreak were associated with major increases."}
