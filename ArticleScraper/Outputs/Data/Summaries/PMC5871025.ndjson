{"summary": "GC376 was administered subcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats. RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV possess ideal targets for virus inhibition. protease inhibitors are also used in combination with inhibitors of reverse transcription for HIV/AIDS for lifelong therapy. t al suggested some of their 3CLpro inhibitors may be used as therapeutic agents against these important viruses in domestic and wild cats. this was demonstrated in a subsequent study using experimental feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) infection in laboratory cats. twenty cats from different regions of the u.s. were ultimately enrolled in the trial. opted and treated with strict client consent (supplementary material) MC Him Cattery Dry (Col) to wet + E, Int, L, MLN, S, Om, P CT04 (Kratos) 82 4.8 MC DSH KR Dry (MLN) Remission CT05 (Scooter) 10 4.25 MC DSH KR Dry (E, MLN, K) \u2013 B, E, L, K, MLN, S, K, A, Lu CT08 (Phoebe) int, L, MLN, S, Om, P CT17 (Smokey) 4 1.84 MC DSH KR Peritonitis Remission CT20 (Cloud) 3.3 1.55 M RM Cattery Pleuritis (MLN) Remission CT21 (Phoebe) 4.8 1.92 F Siberian Cattery Peritonitis + B, E, Om, MLN, Lu, Dia CT23 (Oakely) 3.9 a cat that was a long-term survivor of an earlier pharmacokinetic and efficacy trial of GC376 had a recurrence of FIP manifested by neurologic signs 6 months after what appeared to be successful treatment of acute infection. the diagnosis of FIP was confirmed at the time of entry into the study based on signalment, clinical history, examination of prior laboratory tests, physical examination and repeat of basic blood and effusion analyses. treatment regimen GC376 was synthesized in a highly pure form. it was synthesized at a concentration of 53 mg/ml in 10% ethanol and 90% polyethylene glycol 400. the effective dosage for cats with experimentally induced FIP was 10 mg/kg/q12h SC. blood serum chemistry values were taken periodically to check for potential drug toxicities. samples of abdominal effusions were obtained by paracentesis every other day if obtainable. the owners\u2019 request for care and final disposition of the body was honored. the study was conducted under protocol 18731 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. each owner was required to read and consent to the conditions of the trial. trial design, owner interaction and compliance, monitoring safety and efficacy, establishing a minimal dosage regimen, and determining the clinical forms of FIP most amenable to treatment. this information will, hopefully, assist in the additional testing required for licensing and eventual commercialization of GC376 and for conducting similar trials of future antiviral drugs for FIPV.

GC376 had a recurrence of FIP manifested by neurologic signs. 6 this cat failed to respond to a repeat course of GC376, which prompted a study of the ability of the drug to penetrate into the brain. the diagnosis of FIP was confirmed at the time of entry into the study based on signalment, clinical history, examination of prior laboratory GC376 was synthesized in a highly pure form and formulated at a concentration of 53 mg/ml in 10% ethanol and 90% polyethylene glycol 400. the effective dosage for cats with experimentally induced FIP was 10 mg/kg/q12h SC, but the dosage was raised to 15 mg/kg after the first cat failed to respond to a lower dose of 10 mg/kg suggested earlier pharmacokinetic studies. blood cell count, differential white blood cell percentages, and absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte and eosinophil counts were taken periodically to check for potential drug toxicities. samples of abdominal effusions were obtained by paracentesis every other day if obtainable, usually for the first 3\u20137 days. cats were hospitalized for at least 5 days and immediately started on treatment. they were closely evaluated twice daily for rectal temperature, pulse, respiration, appetite and activity. whole blood was collected in EDTA or heparin prior to starting treatment. injection sites were varied to include the topline from the nape to the mid-back. owners were encouraged to keep daily logs on rectal temperature, activity, appetite, defecation and urination, and weekly to bi-weekly body weights. euthanasia, when required, was conducted either at UC Davis or by the primary-care veterinarian. the primary and secondary treatment periods were then extended to 9 weeks (CT07, CT09, CT10, CT14) all new cats admitted to the trial, and earlier cats such as CT10, were treated or retreated for at least 12 weeks. treatment was stopped in cats that had no clinical or laboratory disease signs after 12 weeks of either primary or secondary treatments. abdominal effusions were usually non-detectable within 2 weeks. the residual thoracic effusion remaining after initial therapeutic drainage was largely gone after 3 days in cat CT20. colonic signs persisted in cat CT03 in the face of treatment. cat CT04, a 6.8-year-old castrated male that presented with dry feline infectious peritonitis, received four rounds of antiviral treatment of increasing duration. it lost weight preceding each relapse and gained increasingly more weight after subsequent treatment. dotted boxes indicate the duration of antiviral treatment (12 weeks) cats that ultimately failed treatment tended to have higher total plasma protein concentrations at the onset of treatment. seven cats went into a sustained remission after 12 weeks of treatment. quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the pretreatment effusion samples of the enrolled patients. the relative baseline viral RNA levels as fold differences compared with the pretreatment viral level of CT02, the cat with the lowest levels of RNA. each point indicates the fold reduction of viral RNA level over that measured prior to treatment. earliest signs of neurologic disease included fever that persisted in the face of treatment for days or weeks, but ultimately progressed to incoordination and tonic/clonic seizures. five cats (CT03, CT07, CT10, CT14 and CT16) had recurrence of typical intra-abdominal lesions in the absence of neurologic signs during or after treatment. cat CT01 presented with effusive FIP and was initially treated with GC376 (10 mg/kg q12h SC for 9 days) the cat responded well, but fever returned on day 9 and the dosage was increased to 15 mg/kg q12h SC for 5 days. a decision was made to stop all treatment after that time. the cat continued treatment for 15 more weeks during which time the drug dosage was transiently decreased twice. but the fever persisted, subtle behavior signs were noted and the cat failed to grow as expected. the cat continued to show signs of variable fever and vague behavioral signs, but the owners were optimistic about the cat\u2019s appetite and level of activity. the sequences of pretreatment viral RNA obtained 25 days (CT16), 139 days (CT02), 149 days (CT12) and 231 days (CT10) later at the time of necropsy were also compared. the viral 3CLpro from lung and spleen of cat CT10 relapsed twice over 8 months and retreated. cat CT21 developed a typical FIP effusion in the chest with fever. the chest fluid was drained to improve breathing and the cat started on a second round of GC376. the cat developed a typical FIP effusion in the chest with fever. the normal formation, growth and eruption of permanent teeth were delayed in all four kittens that were treated starting at 3.3\u20134.4 months of age. the adult teeth appeared smaller than normal and this coupled with delayed eruption led to either retention of deciduous canines, failure of deciduous teeth to be shed or partial eruption of abnormal permanent teeth lingual to retained deciduous teeth. histology of the five cats lacking gross evidence of disease demonstrated mostly mild mononuclear infiltrates. the three cats with non-effusive FIP had mild-to-severe inflammation in many organs with the most severe lesions occurring in the eye, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. cat CT08 developed severe neurologic disease while on initial GC376 treatment. cat CT08 and CT16 responded initially, but their disease signs reappeared while on treatment. cat CT08 had a recurrence of abdominal lesions. cat CT07 developed neurologic disease 6 weeks after starting the second treatment. treatment was stopped in cats that had no clinical or laboratory disease signs after 12 weeks of either primary or secondary treatments. cat CT21 was treated for 17 weeks because of delayed improvement in total protein and white blood cell counts. cat CT04 developed severe neurologic signs 3 weeks after starting treatment. it gained weight after each round of treatment, began to lose weight shortly before each disease relapse, and regained all its lost weight after 9.3 months off and on treatment. all kittens in sustained remission steadily gained weight during and after antiviral treatment. 8-year-old castrated male that presented with dry feline infectious peritonitis received four rounds of antiviral treatment of increasing duration. it lost weight preceding each relapse and gained increasingly more weight after subsequent treatment. dotted boxes indicate the duration of antiviral treatment (12 weeks) cat CT15, CT16 and CT17 had 955, 1699 and 2937 times higher levels of viral RNA, respectively, than CT02. the failure of viral RNA levels of CT16 to rapidly decrease may explain why it did not respond to treatment. quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the pretreatment effusion samples of the enrolled patients. the relative baseline viral RNA levels as fold differences compared with the pretreatment viral level of CT02. each point indicates the fold reduction of viral RNA level over that measured prior to treatment. five cats (CT03, CT07, CT10, CT14 and CT16) had recurrence of typical intra-abdominal lesions in the absence of neurologic signs during or after treatment. the severity of the colonic obstruction necessitated a colon resection, which relieved the clinical signs but did not prevent eventual recurrence of abdominal disease. cat CT01 presented with effusive FIP and was initially treated with GC376 (10 mg/kg q12h SC for 9 days) the cat responded well, but fever returned on day 9 and the dosage was increased to 15 mg/kg q12h for 5 days. the fever disappeared and treatment was stopped at day 14. the cat continued treatment for 15 more weeks during which time the drug dosage was transiently decreased twice for several days. but the fever increased and activity decreased each time and the 15 mg/kg q24h dosage was reinstituted. the cat\u2019s condition remained unchanged with persistent fever, reclusive behavior and failure to grow for another 5 weeks. no differences were observed in 3CLpro over this time. the viral 3CLpro from lung and spleen of cat CT10 relapsed twice over 8 months and retreated. the exact effects of these mutations on protease function are being investigated. the cat developed a typical FIP effusion in the chest with fever. the chest fluid was drained to improve breathing and was afebrile, active and eating normally after 8 weeks of treatment. treatment will last for 12 weeks if no signs of disease reappear. canines, incisors, fourth premolars and molars were the least affected. second and third premolars were the most affected. no other anatomic or physiologic defects have been observed. the three cats with non-effusive FIP had mild-to-severe inflammation in many organs with the most severe lesions occurring in the eye, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. severe inflammation stereotypic of cerebral FIP was present in the brains of all but one of the eight cats that presented to necropsy. cuffs of lymphocytes and plasma cells surround blood vessels (*). multiple cells resembling peritoneal macrophages demonstrate positive immunoreactivity for feline infectious peritonitis antigen. experimentally infected cats die. 15,16 Our predictions proved correct and naturally occurring FIP was much more difficult to treat than the experimental disease. this was the first attempt to use a targeted antiviral drug against a systemic and highly fatal disease of veterinary importance. the present study was limited to 20 cats with FIP, representing a spectrum of ages and disease forms. a surprising amount of information was gleaned, such as how long to treat, potential side effects, and potential indicators for treatment failures and successes. disease remission was sustained for 3 months and longer in only 7/20 of these cats. failure to achieve long-term disease remission was ultimately associated with the occurrence of neurologic disease in the absence of gross abdominal lesions. the high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in this study was greater than previously reported and unexpected given that cats with signs of brain or spinal cord involvement were excluded from the trial. 20 CNS disease was much more likely to occur in older cats with dry or dry-to-wet disease than in young cats with wet FIP. replication in non-neuronal tissues may also enhance positive selection for mutants that are more neurotropic or neurovirulent. the behavior of GC376 treatment in treating ocular FIP was paradoxical. chronic ileocecal and colon involvement and stunted growth in older cats also carried a bad prognosis. the formation of \u2018protective granulomas\u2019 involves a large number of chemokines and cytokines and upregulation of chemokine receptors, addressins, selectins and integrins. 25 Persistence of pathogens in such protected sites may require a higher dose of drug and a longer treatment period. such a failure has been observed for HCV infection of people. CT04 suffered disease relapses requiring reinstitution of treatment. all relapses were identical to the presenting condition and did not involve the CNS. cats with this form of FIP have been known to undergo spontaneous remissions. only one-third of cats were long-term survivors, but the 20 cats in this trial provide a basis for future studies with GC376 and other antiviral drugs that will follow. not all cats will be treatable, but this should not stop the effort.
