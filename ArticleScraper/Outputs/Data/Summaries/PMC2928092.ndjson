{"summary": "every year, there are approximately four billion cases of diarrhoea worldwide. poor quality of water, sanitation, and hygiene account for 1.7 million deaths a year, mainly due to infectious diarrhoea. clean potable water and sanitation are either lacking or inadequate. 37 cases of diarrhoea in children aged less than five years and 23 cases of diarrhoea in individuals aged more than five years were recorded in June 2006. one question that had to be answered was whether there was any epidemiological link between the water used by the residents of the community and the outbreak of diarrhoea. the arcGIS software (version 9.1) used proportional symbol to represent the total number of people affected in each household. the plotted circle proportionately quantifies the number of people affected at each household. the technology is mostly useful in wide-area applications with various sources of water and population exposures. mendo-Agar, mFC agar, and m-enterococcus agar were used for the cultivation of total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and enterococci respectively. plates were incubated at 37 oC for 24 hours, 37 oC for 48 hours, and 44.5 oC for 24 hours for total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and enterococci respectively. the geographic grid of the study area is located between 22\u00b055'S and 22\u00b057'S latitude and 29\u00b054'E and 29\u00b059'E longitude. the population size is approximately 5,300, with a high unemployment rate and limited clean potable water infrastructure. the techlo-gy can be used where there are limited data points to provide clarity and simplify information for dissemination. the available water-abstraction points comprise Tank 1, Tank 2, and the Khandanama river. one mL each from the 101, 102, 103, and 104 dilutions was spread on PCA, followed by incubation at 37 oC for 48 hours. the water-points were sampled and analyzed twice during the outbreak in July 2006. a third sampling was conducted in October 2006 at the end of the outbreak. twenty-six of the 32 households affected used groundwater from Tank 1 and Tank 2 while only six used water from the river. of 69 individuals who used Tank 1, 29 (42%) had diarrhoea; 16 (34%) of 47 individuals who used Tank 2 had diarrhoea; and 15 (52%) of the 29 individuals who used the Khandanama river had diarrhoea. microbes, tank 1 and tank 2 and even the Khandanama river could be contaminated from pit-latrines in the study area. more cases of diarrhoea may be associated with the water-tanks. the near-absence of indicator organisms in Tank 2 is surprising. the borehole recharging Tank 1 is upstream of that recharging Tank 2. the source of microbial contaminants was probably upstream of both the boreholes for their presence to be detected in Tank 1. the faecal coliform, total coliform, enterococci, and heterotrophic counts were much higher than the recommended minimum for Tank 1 and the Khandamana river. the counts for tank 2 were within the acceptable limits, except for the heterotrophic counts. the storage of water in jerry-cans and other containers for several days was observed as a common practice among the households. each household had a pit-latrine which was in use, and none had a flush toilet. a significant number of diarrhoea cases were indicated to the south of the study area closer to Tank 2. this is because of the fact that tank 1 and Tank 2 were supplied by two different boreholes in the vicinity of the Khandanama river through pipes. this is because of the fact that when the percentages of affected individuals who used the different sources of water were compared, there was no significant difference between them. the faecal coliform, total coliform, enterococci, and total coliform counts far exceeded the recommended minimum values of the South African water-quality guidelines. all the sources also had high values of heterotrophic counts which exceeded the acceptable limit for no risk. the near-absence of indicator organisms in Tank 2 is surprising. faecal coliform, total coliform, enterococci, and heterotrophic counts were much higher than the recommended minimum. the values for faecal coliforms, total coliform, and enterococci counts are the meansstandard deviations. the counts for Tank 1 and the Khandamana river were within the acceptable limits, except for the heterotrophic counts. an attempt was made to isolate potential diarrhoegenic bacteria from the water-extraction points. the absence of these organisms in samples taken from Tank 1 and 2 could be due to the fact that the organisms occurred in smaller numbers in the tank. no hot-spot in an outbreak of diarrhoea was found when GIS tools were employed in epidemiologic investigation of acute diarrhoea in a village in southern India. however, microbiological examination showed that the water used by the residents of the village had high coliform counts, and the chlorine level was inadequate to decontaminate common pathogens. a study in Mexico City linked the rate of diarrhoea in children to the water used for domestic purposes which present study indicated that most sources of water were contaminated with pathogenic organisms, such as enteropathogenic E. coli, Vibrio, Salmonella, Shigella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas species (3). a significant proportion of HIV/AIDS patients reside in rural areas, which lack good sanitation and adequate supply of potable water. the frequent outbreaks of diarrhoea or gastroenteritis in rural communities in the developing world have all been attributed to the consumption of water of poor microbial quality. the hot-spot of the outbreak of diarrhoea was linked to water from tank 1 and the Khandanama river, both of which were the most contaminated. the authors thank the staff of the Tshikuwi Clinic for providing data on diarrhoea cases. the cordial participation of the households is appreciated."}
