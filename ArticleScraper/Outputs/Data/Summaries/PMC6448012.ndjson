{"summary": "coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 (-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 (-coronavirus) circulated in the human population and caused mild respiratory infections. over the last two decades, there have been two zoonotic emergence of coronaviruses into the human population. both linked with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) the prevalence of the virus was recently reported in non-camelid domestic mammals such as sheep, goat, donkey, and cow. the origin of human MERS-CoV is considered to be from the bats. studies have suggested that there were few evidences where the virus showed camel origin. in 2015, the MERS-CoV outbreak in south Korea involved 186 cases. a total of 83% cases of transmission were due to five super spreaders. 44% of 186 cases were in patients those who were experienced nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. the laboratory confirmed cases and deaths reported in several countries from the year 2012 to 2018 are shown in Table 1. the patients belonged to the countries such as Malaysia and United arab Emirates. the genome of the coronavirus consists of 6 and 7 open reading frames (ORFs) s and the other four ORFs on the downstream side encode for the structural proteins such as envelope protein (E), Spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), and membrane protein (M) in some coronaviruses, hemagglutinin-esterase gene is present in the region between ORF 1b and S. the two main poly-proteins pp1ab and pp1a are cleaved into 15/16 non-structural proteins (nsp) by 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) these proteases are cleaved from pp1ab along with other ORFs encoding nsp which are essential for activating RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, exo- the accessory ORF functions can be targeted for both therapeutic and vaccine treatments in response to MERS-CoV and related group 2C corona viruses. the genome organization of MERS-CoV is illustrated in Figure 1. coronaviruses display recombination, high rates of mutation, and propensity to cross species. all human and camel MERS-CoVs were identified to be homologous to each other. they isolated 13 new viral genomes in which 12 possessed point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD of S protein) core sub domain contains anti-parallel -sheet (five-stranded) and six helices in the center. most of the connecting loops and two small 310 helices are located in the inner region of the sheet. the core of 6HB consists of a triple-stranded coiled like structure constructed by HR1s of the three spike subunits forming trimers. the HR2 elements are found to be packed within the grooves of the coiled coil in an anti-parallel direction. the viral RNA undergoes replication and transcription followed by genome transcription. hematological aberrations delineated for clinical cases of neutrophilia (8%), lymphopenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and lymphocytosis (11%. first evidence of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV was reported in few cases in the united kingdom. several studies suggested that the virus was not self-sustained as during local epidemic of MERS-CoV. the virus has not been readily transmitted to more than one human and has been reported in majority of human related cases. viral particles were found to be localized in pulmonary macrophages, pneumocytes, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles. the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in human and animals is due to three mechanisms such as DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) mediated mechanism, papain like protease PLpro mediated mechanism and accessory proteins like p4a and membrane M the core domain structure is balanced by three disulfide linkages. the core of 6HB consists of a triple-stranded. the core of 6HB is a triple-stranded. infected patients often indicate presence of hemoptysis, sore throat, fever, cough, shortness of breath. a low range of lower pulmonary infiltrate associated with viral pneumonia was observed in the radiograph of patients infected with MERS-CoV. hematological aberrations delineated for the clinical cases of neutrophilia (8%), lymphopenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and lymphocytosis (11%. the first evidence of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV was reported in few cases in the united kingdom. local epidemic of MERS-CoV has not been readily transmitted to more than one human and has been reported in majority of human related cases. the virus is transmitted from the infected camel to the human and camel to various animals. the virus is transmitted to other human populations via human to human transmissions. viral particles were found to be localized in the pulmonary macrophages, pneumocytes, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles. studies suggested that the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in human and animals are due to three mechanisms such as DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) mediated mechanism, papain like protease PLpro mediated mechanism and accessory proteins like p4 derived HFL, Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7, HEK, His-1 cell lines, CD8+, and CD4+ are susceptible to MERS-CoV. the unfolding FD required the cleavage of S protein by host proteases. the cleavage at S1/S2 site is essential for the infection of Calu3 cells. PLpro and 3C-like proteinase are processed by two viral proteases. they form 16 nonstructural proteins necessary for membrane-associated replication complex. PLpro can inhibit mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein induced IFN- reporter activity. p4a-dsRNA complex stabilized by amino acids such as K27, W45, K63, and K67. expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed as NF-B translocated to the nucleus. expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. the expression of M protein in MERS-CoV may suppress the type-I IFN expression in response to poly (I: C) induction or Sendai virus infection. the interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 and the association of disrupted TRAF3\u2013TBK1 lead to reduced activation of IRF3. inflammatory cytokine response in these cells was found to be limited. a delayed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were observed upon the viral infection. the maturation restricted the viral replication. animal models are essential for translation of findings from drug discovery process. assessing face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. the rhesus macaque and common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV. transgenic hDPP4 mice were developed as animal model (Peck et al., 2015) the major advantages and limitations of MERS-CoV animal models are listed in Table 2. the first transgenic MERS-CoV mouse model was established by Agrawal et al. (2015). the transgenic mice infected with an intra-nasal dose of 106 TCID50 developed pneumonia, weight loss, acute pulmonary viral infection, ruffled fur, squinting, and death within few days. the 288-330+/+MERS-CoV mouse model demonstrated severe respiratory infection as observed in humans. rhesus macaques and marmosets were developed moderate respiratory disease which are comparable with mild human MERS-CoV infection. as observed in humans, they also showed complete blood count abnormalities. rabbits developed asymptomatic pulmonary infections with high levels of viral antigens and RNA. increased pulmonary inflammation was observed after re-infection. re-infection elicited neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) the transgenic mice expressed hDPP4 and developed severe respiratory MERS-CoV infections. the transgenic mice expressed hDPP4 and developed severe respiratory MERS-CoV infections. the pathology of infected mice showed pneumonia-like symptoms. the pathology of infected mice showed pneumonia-like symptoms. rhesus macaques and marmosets were developed moderate respiratory disease. marmosets demonstrated widespread pulmonary oedema and hemorrhaging. oedematous alveolar cavities showed fibrinous exudates and neutrophil infiltration. pathological changes as a result of viral infection were not observed in any other organs of the infected animal. the primary diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was performed by molecular techniques such as real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), reverses transcription\u2013loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-RTPA), and reverses transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification. ELISA, spike immunofluorescent assay, spike pseudoparticle neutralization and microneutralization assay. none of the serological assays showed evidence of exact occurrence of MERS-CoV in camels. a rapid and specific assay for the detection of MERS-CoV. antibodies such as REGN3048 and REGN3051 showed no binding with S protein. these antibodies were blocked entry of the virus into susceptible cell lines. the diagnostically relevant variations in the neutralization activity have not been detected in several isolates. current Vaccine and Antiviral Candidates MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are still under development with DNA based, protein based, live attenuated and vectored-virus based vaccines (Arabi et al., 2017). out of the four structural proteins and sixteen non structural proteins encoded by the viral genome, S protein showed the highest immunogenicity which induced T-cell responses. a prophylactic DNA-plasmid vaccine encoded the first 725 amino acids of S protein in MERS-CoV which induced the cell mediated and antigen-specific humoral immune responses in mice. the vaccines present the antigens in natural ways which further stimulate the activation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to the native protein conformation. fected cells were primary antigen sources for detecting presence of human anti-MERS-CoV Nabs, IgM, and IgG in human samples. human monoclonal antibody m336 demonstrated neutralizing properties against MERS-CoV in vitro conditions. anti-DPP4 antibodies prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into susceptible cells, obstructing the virus infection. the anti-DPP4 antibodies such as 1F7, 2F9, and YS110 prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into susceptible cells. the vaccines that imitate the natural infection present the antigens in natural ways which further stimulate the activation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to the native protein conformation. the live attenuated viruses have been the most immunogenic platforms available, they exhibited the capability to present numerous antigens across the viral life cycle. a nucleoside analog GS-5734 known as Remdesivir showed potential antiviral activity against human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro. the drug inhibited MERS-CoV at 50% effective concentration values (EC50) the conserved nature of the N protein was used to develop vaccines that can induce an adaptive immune response against these proteins. the negative effects of these epitopes can be surmounted by immunofocusing. mapping of the most neutralizing RBD fragment and eliminating unnecessary fragments can help in focusing the immune response to important epitopes. in vivo animal model, tissue culture model, human challenge model, and vaccine studies. these models are anxious by challenges, preferably yielding a spectra of severity of diseases like lethal versus sub-lethal in order to increase divergence for downstream data mining and modeling. the screening of dominant immunogens based on genome sequence data is crucial for designing novel vaccines, which is assisted by immunoinformatics approaches. the epitope directed lead design was one of the critical steps involved in the lead identification by immunoinformatics approaches. the prototype of these approaches included the in vivo animal model, tissue culture model, human challenge model, and vaccine studies. these models are anxious by challenges, preferably yielding a spectra of the severity of the diseases like lethal versus sub-lethal in order to increase divergence for downstream data mining and modeling. the epitope directed lead design was one of the critical steps involved in the lead identification by immunoinformatics approaches. MHC-I restrained CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) identification provides profound insight in designing novel antiviral agents."}
