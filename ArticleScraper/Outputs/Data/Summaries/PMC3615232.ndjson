{"summary": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a major disease in the poultry industry worldwide. the disease frequently occurs in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks. it has caused severe economic loss over the last few years. chickens were immunized monovalently with each individual plasmid (pVAX1-16S1, pVAX1-16M, and pVAX1-16N) or multivalently with a combination of the three different plasmids (pVAX1-16S1/M/N) to improve IBV vaccine efficacy, the chickens were immunized with a multivalent DNA vaccine followed by boosting with an inactivated IBV vaccine. inactivated vaccine 200 L was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. the embryos were incubated at 37\u00b0C and examined twice daily for their viability. seven-day-old chickens were randomly divided into seven groups of 20 chickens each. each group was injected with 100 g (1 g/L) monovalent DNA vaccine. pVAX1-16S1/M/N was a multivalent DNA vaccine containing 100 g of each plasmid. the virus-serum mixtures in each dilution were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos in ten replicates. the embryos were also inoculated with 100 EID50 alone in parallel. microtiter plates were seeded in U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. each blood sample was tested in triplicate. each blood sample was incubated for 48 h at 40\u00b0C. virus challenge Three weeks after third vaccination, all chickens were challenged with 103 EID50 of IBVSX16. surviving chickens were euthanized humanely by pectoral muscle injection of ketamine hydrochloride in 22 mg/kg of body weight 14 days post-infection. the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan) the PCR reaction contained 1 L of cDNA (about 100 ng), 5 L of 10 PCR buffer, 4 L of 2.5 mmol/L dNTP, 2 L of 10 mmol/L of each of the primers, 0.25 L of 2 U/L Taq DNA polymerase, and 37.75 L of H2O Virus stocks containing 1 103 egg infective dosage (EID50) of IBVSX16 with 100 L were used to inoculate the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs. allantoic fluid containing the virus was harvested after 48 h post-inoculation, stored at -80\u00b0C until use. the allantoic fluids were harvested after 72 h. one part of the inactivated allantoic fluid was then emulsified with two parts (v/v) of paraffin oil. Detection of anti-IBV antibodies Titers of antibodies against IBV was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Idexx Laboratories, USA) each serum sample, including the negative and positive controls, was analyzed in triplicate. centrifuge at 400 g/min for 20 min, aspirate coat of leukocyte, add 4 mL KPMI 1640. centrifuge at 400 g/min for 20 min, discard supernatant and wash precipitation cell twice. freshly isolated PBMCs were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates. analysis of T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) PBMCs were isolated from blood by lympholyte-mammal (Cedarlane, Canada) the samples were adjusted to 1 107 cells / mL with RPMI 1640 medium. after the incubation, all samples were washed three times with cold PBS. surviving chickens were euthanized humanely by pectoral muscle injection of ketamine hydrochloride in 22 mg/kg of body weight 14 days post-infection. the number of IBV-positive chickens was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the concentrations of serum anti-IBV antibodies were measured with a serum-neutralizing assay and an ELISA. the titers measured at each time point were significantly different in each group. all the mean serum IBV-neutralizing antibody titers between different time points were significantly different (p 0.01) antibody titers of the pVAX1-16S1/M/N + inactive vaccine group were much higher than those of the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group (p 0.01) on days 21 and 35. but no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two groups was observed on day 49. absence of a letter indicates that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between any of the time points. PBMC proliferation in response to IBV was also observed in chickens immunized with pVAX1-16S1, pVAX1-16M, pVAX1-16N, and pVAX1-16S1/M/N. Absence of a letter indicates that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between any of the time points. differences between corresponding treatments from different day groups are significant (p 0.01) chickens in the pVAX1-inocluated group developed clinical signs of infection including coughing, nasal discharge, and dyspnea. the mortality rate was 5% for the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group, 10% for the inactivated vaccine group, and 100% for the pVAX1-16S1/M/N + inactivated vaccine animals. chickens in the pVAX1-16S1/M/N + inactivated vaccine group were effectively protected from challenge with virulent IBVSX16 virus. 10% of the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group and 20% of the birds receiving the vaccine were positive according to the RT-PCR analysis. VAX1-16M, pVAX1-16N, or pVAX1-16S1/M/N increased from day 7 to day 49 (Fig. 1). antibody titers of the multivalent pVAX1-16S1/M/N-immunized chickens were significantly higher than those of all chickens immunized with the monovalent DNA vaccine on days 21, 35, and 49 (p 0.01). data are expressed as the mean SD for 10 chickens in each group. each column is labeled with a letter. Absence of a letter indicates that no significant differences were observed between any time points. immunization with a combination of the three-gene DNA vaccine and an inactivated vaccine induced the highest IBV-specific cellular proliferation rates in the chickens. the responses of all experimental groups to stimulation with ConA were similar to ones provoked by IBV. the highest percentage of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected in the pVAX1-16S1 or pVAX1-16M groups (p 0.01) the highest percentage of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected in the pVAX1-16S1 or pVAX1-16M groups. mortality rate was 5% for the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group, 10% for the inactivated vaccine group, and 0% for birds treated with pVAX1-16S1/M/N + inactivated vaccine animals. chickens in only the inactivated vaccine group developed more conspicuous and severe symptom and pathological changes. all three IBV proteins selected for this study have their own unique and important roles in eliciting IBV immune responses. the DNA vaccination with pVAX1-16M alone provoked the weakest immune response. pVAX1-16S1 induced the highest antibody titers among the three constructs. the inactivated vaccine has a better capability than choosing DNA plasmid as the booster to evoke memory B cells. the inactivated vaccine stimulated a relatively strong IBV-specific cellular response but low antibody titers. chickens that received the inactivated vaccine were fully protected from IBVSX16 challenge."}
