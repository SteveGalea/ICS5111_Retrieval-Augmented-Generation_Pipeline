{"summary": "Egypt faced its first H5N1 outbreak in 2006 where a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was detected in poultry. by 2008, the virus had become endemic, and vaccine-escape variants have emerged despite commercial poultry vaccines exhibiting protection in laboratory settings. global concern regarding Egyptian H5N1 influenza viruses is currently high, as some isolates have been reported to have at least two mutations. emergence of an Egypt H5N1 drift variant exhibited significantly decreased cross-reactivity by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays against the Mexican vaccine seed strain is important. serological tests are routinely employed in avian influenza reference laboratories as promoted by the FAO/OIE Network of expertise on animal influenza. new studies have revealed that cross-neutralizing antibodies binding to the stalk region of HA can be indirectly measured by pp-NT assays. this study reports on the screening of avian sera for antibodies elicited by LPAI and HPAI viruses. this study proposes a new perspective for the widening application and validation of pp-NT serological assays. a no-HA control was generated by co-transfection of producer cell lines with two plasmids, gag-pol pCMV-8.91 and pCSFLW. panel 1 consisted of 10 sera positive for antibodies to the LPAI H5N2 vaccine strain. ified incremental HI titers were used for comparative firefly luciferase and GFP-pseudotype neutralization assays. panel 4 consisting of 16 reference hyperimmune sera produced against 16 influenza subtypes (from Group 1 and Group 2) was also provided. panel 4 consisting of 16 reference hyperimmune sera produced against 16 influenza subtypes (from Group 1 and Group 2). firefly luciferase pseudotypes bearing HAs from HPAI H5 (A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/chicken/Egypt/1709-1/2007, A/chicken/Egypt/1709-6/2008) and the HPAI H7 strain (A/chicken/Italy/13474/99) were used. pp-NT assay was performed using a packaging construct with GFP reporter gene. a complete medium was dispensed into each well of a clear 96-well flat-bottomed plate. 8 rows of serial dilutions were prepared, followed by the addition of 50 L of HEK-293T cells to each well. pseudotype Virus Production Lentiviral pseudotypes with HA envelope glycoproteins derived from the HPAI viruses H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/chicken/Egypt/1709-1/2007 and A/chicken/Egypt/1709-6/2008) and H7 (A/chicken/Italy/13474/99) were constructed as described previously. panel 1 consisted of 10 sera positive for antibodies to the LPAI H5N2 vaccine strain (A/chicken/Mexico/232/94/CPA) obtained from chickens vaccinated at 21 days of age and boosted after 3 weeks with a commercially available inactivated vaccine. panel 4 consisted of 16 reference hyperimmune sera produced against 16 influenza subtypes (from Group 1 and Group 2). standard protocols for HI and MN assays were followed for both assays. HI assays were carried out for the H5- and H7-positive serum panels using the test antigens. pp-NT assay was performed using pseudotypes bearing HA from HPAI A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/chicken/Egypt 1709-1/2007 strains. results were compared to control wells containing virus alone, with the RLUs from cell-only wells subtracted from all readings. pseudotype transduction titers obtained at each of a range of dilution points were expressed as RLU/mL. arithmetic mean was calculated by GraphPad Prism (version 5, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) pp-NT assays were normalized and IC50 and IC90 values were calculated by dose-response inhibition analysis. neutralizing antibodies were measured using firefly luciferase HPAI H5 influenza pseudotypes bearing HA glycoproteins derived from the HPAI viruses. clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/chicken/Egypt 1709-1/2007, and A/chicken/Egypt/1709-6/2008. IC90-neutralizing antibody titres tested by pseudotype-based neutralization assays for chickens titers obtained via HI correlated strongly with titers obtained using clade 2.2.1 A/chicken/Egypt 1709-1/2007 (r 2 = 0.6291). similar levels of correlation were observed between pp-NT titres and MN titres for both strains. pp-NT showed the correlation of antibody logarithmic titers measured by pp-NT (using A/chicken/Egypt/1709-1/2007) versus HI (tested against A/chicken/Egypt/1709-1/2007). correlation gave a P value 0.0001. sera was tested in parallel against firefly luciferase HPAI H5 Pseudotypes. three sera (3929-1, 3929-9, and 3929-6) were scored as 100% neutralization activity with pp titers >1 : 1280. sera 3930-19, 3931-26, and 3930-20 showed 50% neutralization activity. sera no.
