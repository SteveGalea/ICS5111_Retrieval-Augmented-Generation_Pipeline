{"summary": "CARV infections range from asymptomatic carriership to significant respiratory disease. prevalence of CARV largely depends on season, detection mode, age of patient and immune status. HCT is a curative treatment for several malignant and non-malignant childhood diseases. success is limited by infections, allo-immunity and toxic events. Respiratory viruses contribute to post-transplantation morbidity and mortality. para influenza virus (PIV) in HCT recipients is systematically reviewed by Shah et al. (2016a) the incidence of PIV in HCT recipients is 5% (range 0.2\u201319%), 36% progressing to LRTI. hRV may be a clinically significant pathogen with the potential to cause serious pulmonary disease in HCT recipients. there is increasing interest in the pathogenecity of human metapneumo virus. progression to lower infection however was associated with higher BoV load and viremia. profound immunosuppression in patients undergoing HCT obviously leads to a greater risk of infection, with prolonged shedding of the virus. preparations in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 4 g/l) and intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSF-F protein (palivizumab) may be considered. they do not advocate routine screening for CARV. a joint working group in the UK has reviewed the available literature. patients the cause of death was thought to be directly related to the pre-HCT RV. no data are given about the cause of death in the other patients. most patients with RSV or influenza were treated with antiviral therapy. centers 16.6% acquired symptomatic RV within the first year after HCT. most children had URTI only, in patients with hMPV there was significantly more LRTI. steroid exposure and RV detection within 60 days were poor prognostic factors for morbidity and death. in 250 patients, 50 (20%) developed CLAD at a median of 95 weeks. in 79 patients (31.6%) a respiratory viral episode was seen. this association was stronger the more proximate the RV occurred after lung transplantation. RV was found in 61% (41% in BAL/NPA, 20% in NPA-only) no other predictors were found. allo-immune lung syndrome (BOS) or Idiopathic Pneumonia syndrome (IPS) occurred in 13%. respiratory viruses can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses promoting bacterial colonization. role of disturbed microbiome/virome in lung disease is postulated for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the definition criteria for alloimmune mediated lung syndromes describe the clinical, radiologic and functional aspects of lung pathology. one can argue if this holds true for respiratory viruses detected by PCR. the impact of positive findings on the disease criteria should be reevaluated. authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication. conflict of interest statement The reviewer PV declared a past co-authorship with one of the authors JB to the handling editor. the remaining author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
