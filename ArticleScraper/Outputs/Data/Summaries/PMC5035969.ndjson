{"summary": "enveloped viruses are wrapped with naked shells made of viral capsid proteins. enveloped viruses are covered with a lipid-bilayer, called a viral envelope. the envelope is obtained from progenitor host cells during the budding process. enveloped animal viruses possess greater adaptability than non-enveloped animal viruses. fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes is absolutely critical for entry of enveloped viruses. most viral envelope proteins have a single transmembrane domain (TMD) class II fusion proteins are found in flaviviruses, hepaciviruses, alphaviruses, togaviruses, and rift Valley fever viruses. they depend on a viral chaperone for folding, which is produced from the same polypeptide precursor where they are arrayed in tandem. when the chaperone is cleaved off, the fusion protein gains the fusogenic activity. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env precursor gp160 has 34 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. most of their respective molar masses are derived from N-linked glycans. if glycosylation occurs close to glycoprotein processing sites, it may block the precursor cleavage by proteases. glycosylation and unfolded protein response Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. viral and host proteins are glycosylated in a similar manner by the same mechanism. glycosylation and unfolded protein response Viruses are obligate parasites. the first step in this process is the sequential removal of the two outermost Glc residues on branch A. the first Glc residue is removed by glucosidase I (GI), resulting in the di-glycosylated oligosaccharide Glc2Man9GlcNAc2. the second Glc residue is then removed by glucosidase II (GII) the remaining Man residues are cleaved by the Golgi mannosidases. the glycan remolding process is continued through the remainder of the N-glycosylation pathway. the core is composed of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc, blue), nine mannose (Man, red), and three glucose (Glc, yellow) residues. terminally misfolded glycoproteins will be demannosylated to remove all 1,2-Man residues (XI), followed by association with lectins osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS9) and XTP3-transactivated gene B protein (XTP3-B) for ERAD (XII). ERManI containing QCV are rapidly recycled through autophagy/lysosome pathways (XIV) if glycoproteins with the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide display non-native conformations, they are reglucosylated by the UDP-Glc:unfolded glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGT1) or UGGT, they are subject to additional rounds of re-engagement with the CNX/CRT machinery until folding is achieved. if a certain time frame for the folding is exceeded, proteins may never fold ER stress is sensed by three ER transmembrane receptors. PERK and ATF6 are in association with another ER chaperone. PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2. ER-associated protein degradation ERAD is a protein quality control mechanism conserved in all eukaryotic cells. ER-associated protein degradation ERAD results in selective dislocation of unfolded and misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol via specific membrane machinery. so far, more than 60 human diseases have been attributed to this pathway [41] the process of ERAD can be divided into three steps: substrate recognition, retrotranslocation, and ubiquitylation/proteasomal degradation. extensive excision of 1,2-Man residues from N-glycans sends an important signal to trigger misfolded glycoprotein degradation. the third subfamily consists of the ER degradation-enhancing -mannosidase-like proteins (EDEM 1, 2 and 3. ERManI exhibits slow rate of enzymatic activity, which allows nascent proteins to perform multiple rounds of reglucosylation and achieve proper folding. if glycoproteins are misfolded terminally, the remaining three 1,2-Man residues are excised from these molecules. it is still not understood how misfolded glycoproteins are subject to such extensive demannosylation in the ER and then targeted for ERAD. EDEM2 catalyzes the first step of Man trimming, whereas EDEM1 and EDEM3 contribute the second step. under these joint actions, all four 1,2-Man residues are removed from the oligosaccharide. p97 is a member of the ATPases associated with the diverse cellular activities (AAA) family. the sec61 heterotrimeric channel is the main translocon involved in co-translational protein transport into the ER. the second candidate is a member of the Derlin family (Derlin-1, -2, and -3). the third candidate includes the ERAD-specific E3 ligases. the mammalian ortholog of Hrd3 is SEL1L, which is required for ERAD substrate retrotranslocation. Hrd1 interacts with Der1, and the Der1-Hrd1 interaction is bridged by another integral membrane protein Usa1. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein that has 14 transmembrane domains. EDEM1 is segregated into ER-derived, LC3-I-associated vesicles. EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L are concentrated when they lack client glycoproteins to dislocate. ERmanI, EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L are short-lived proteins. lysosomal inhibitors are able to cause the accumulation of an aggregating mutant of dysferlin in the ER when compared to the wild-type. however, under ER stress, most of these factors are highly induced, including the EDEM proteins, but not ERManI. EDEM1 stabilizes ERManI and increases its protein expression at steady-state levels. enveloped viruses may bud through the plasma membrane or an intracellular compartment. many viral envelope glycoproteins are targeted to the ER for post-translational modifications and folding. a similar shutdown by PKR has been used in the interferon pathway. viruses have evolved to manipulate host UPR signaling pathways to promote viral infections. despite the detrimental effects, viruses have evolved to manipulate host UPR signaling pathways to promote viral infections. DP71L mutant viruses lack increased eIF2 phosphorylation. DP71L activation by virus is implicated in caspase activation and early apoptosis. kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PP1: activating transcription factor 6; eIF2: eukaryotic initiation factor-2; PP1: protein phosphatase 1; LMP1: latent membrane protein 1. below, we will focus on the roles of ERAD played in virus replication. US2/TRC8 complex maintains its MHC-1 degradation activity in SPP/ knockout cells, suggesting that SPP binding is not related to MHC-1 degradation. initial reports found an association with SEL1L and assumed that US11 mediated MHC-1 degradation could be SEL1L/HRD1 dependent. herpesviruses have evolved numerous strategies to block the MHC antigen presentation and evade the host immune response to establish a persistent infection. lentiviruses also harness the ERAD pathway to promote their replication via downregulation of their receptor CD4. lentiviruses produce two accessory proteins, Nef and Vpu, to trigger CD4 degradation via two distinctive mechanisms. degradation also requires the cytosolic ATPase p97 and its cofactors UFD1L and NPL4. the degradation is not dependent on HRD1, SEL1L, and UBC7. viruses may harness ERAD components to benefit replication. replication of positive-strand RNA viruses normally involves the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) by rearrangement of cellular membranes, which segregates and protects viral proteins and genomes from the host\u2019s innate immune response. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), equine arteritis virus (JEV) indeed replicate in these ERAD tuning vesicles. almost 85% of Env proteins are retained in the ER and degraded. this degradation mechanism was not clear until recently. we isolated HIV-1 non-permissive (NP) and permissive (P) T cell clones N2-NP and N5-P. ERManI is a 699-amino-acid, 79.5-kDa, type II membrane protein. it is divided into an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CD), transmembrane helix, lumenal \u2018stem\u2019 region. in the catalytic domain, there are seven residues that are critical for ERManI function. ed human alpha1-antitrypsin variant null (Hong Kong) for degradation via ERAD, but neither its catalytic activity nor its catalytic domain is required for this degradation. the viral protein R (Vpr) of HIV-1 enhances viral replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells. EDEM1 overexpression destabilizes S, M, and L, and EDEM1 silencing stabilizes expression. the autophagy/lysosomal pathway, but not the proteasomal pathway, is involved in the degradation of HBV surface glycoproteins. both EDEM1 and EDEM3 but not EDEM2, interact with E2. gH, gB, gL, and gM are constituents of the gcII type complexes found on the surface of HCMV virions. a pentameric complex between gH, gL, and the gene products U128, U130, and U131 is able to mediate entry into different cell types via pH-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis. gH is degraded via ERAD in the absence of EDEM3 has two new features including an additional protease-associated domain of unknown function and a KDEL signal for ER retention. ERManI is expressed at very low basal levels in cells, and its expression is not induced by UPR. if this basic mechanism fails to restore ER homeostasis, IRE1/XBP1 is induced to elevate expression of the EDEMs, which will increase ERAD. gi intermediate compartments and quality control vesicles lend credence to both current theories that ERManI is either a Golgi checkpoint in quality control that will return misfolded proteins back to the ER for further processing. viruses have evolved to manipulate host UPR and ERAD to optimize their replication."}
