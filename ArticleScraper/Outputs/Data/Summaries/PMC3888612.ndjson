{"summary": "KD affects 8.1/100 000 children under the age of 5 years in the uk. it is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. the disease is associated with systemic vasculitis. 85% of children with KD are younger than 5 years of age, with peak age incidence at 18\u201324 months. patients aged less than 3 months, or more than 5 years are encountered less commonly, but are at increased risk for CAA formation. aetiology of KD remains unknown, but no single agent has been consistently identified. a genetic contribution to the risk of KD is suggested by the much higher risk of the disease in Asian children. many candidate genes have previously been suggested, either as susceptibility genes for developing KD; or increasing risk of CAA. TPKC, ABCC4 and FCGR2A, CD40 and a gene region near FAM167A-BLK. other genes have been associated with non-response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and risk of CAA. GWAS methodology has so far only identified the most significant associations. Japanese Variations in the FAM167ABLK region have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. the debate over the infectious cause of KD has centred around the mechanism of immune activation: conventional antigen versus superantigen (SAg) several studies have presented evidence supporting superantigen-triggered process, but others have not confirmed the association. genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the advantage of identifying disease-associated genes without requiring prior knowledge of the mechanisms involved. several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to KD have been published so far. l 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C 19q23 Japanese, American ITPKC acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation through the Ca2+/NFAT signalling pathway. the C allele may contribute to immune hyper-reactivity in KD. this finding provides new insights into the mechanisms of immune activation in KD. the diagnosis rests on combinations of clinical criteria and laboratory findings (table 2). for the diagnosis to be established according to the Diagnostic Guidelines of the Japan KD Research Committee, five of the six criteria in table 2 should be present. many patients have some but not all of the clinical features of KD. the exact mechanism of the irritability is unclear, but it may be related to the presence of aseptic meningitis. the diagnosis of KD must be considered in any child with a febrile exanthematous illness. uria, proteinuria, tubular disturbances, tubulointerstitial nephritis, petechial rash, shock syndrome, febrile convulsions and encephalopathy or ataxia. additional rare complications of KD include macrophage activation syndrome (secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion resulting in hyponatraemia. pyuria and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (predominantly lymphocytes) representing aseptic meningitis also occur. Several scoring systems have been developed to identify children at highest risk of IVIG resistance and, hence, highest risk of developing CAA. 78 86 77 Specificity (%) 76 67 86 Non-Japanese cases51 Sensitivity (%) 42 33 40 Specificity (%) 85 87 85 ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CRP, C-reactive protein; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin. hypoalbuminaemia is common; sterile pyuria and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (predominantly lymphocytes) representing aseptic meningitis also occur. Several scoring systems have been developed to identify children at highest risk of IVIG resistance. 78 86 77 Specificity (%) 76 67 86 Non-Japanese cases51 Sensitivity (%) 42 33 40 Specificity (%) 85 87 85 ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CRP, C-reactive protein; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin. corticosteroids for the primary treatment of severe KD IVIG resistance occurs in up to 20% of cases, and these patients are at increased risk of developing CAA unless they receive additional treatment. corticosteroids for the primary treatment of severe KD IVIG resistance occurs in up to 20% of cases. the benefit was found in several subgroup analyses including the six prospective RCTs and studies using prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone. the meta-analysis provides convincing evidence that steroids combined with IVIG as initial treatment reduces overall risk of CAA in severe KD. 80% of patients with KD respond to aspirin and IVIG, and CAA are most commonly seen in those who fail to respond to IVIG. 80% of patients with KD respond to aspirin and IVIG, and CAA are most commonly seen in those who fail to respond to IVIG. a low Kobayashi score does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. corticosteroids should be considered for patients with features of the most severe disease (and therefore the greatest likelihood of developing CAA) in the absence of validated risk scores outside of Japan, such patients include the very young (1-year-old); those with markers of severe inflammation, including: persistently elevated CRP despite IVIG, liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminaemia, and anaemia. risk scores for IVIG resistance perform sub-optimally in non-Japanese patients. but a score 5 does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. aim of treatment is to switch off the inflammatory process damaging the coronary arteries as rapidly as possible. a second dose may not be beneficial if there was little response to the first dose. a second dose may not be beneficial if there was little response to the first dose. there are emerging animal data case reports suggesting a role for anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- therapy for the treatment of KD. infliximab (n=20) showed that patients treated with infliximab had fewer days of fever and shorter hospitalisation, but with similar coronary artery outcomes. soluble TNF receptor is an alternative TNF antagonist, and has been reported to be safe and well tolerated in 15 children with KD. the use of these agents cannot be recommended routinely but can be considered on a case-by-case basis. if aneurysms persist, antiplatelet therapy should be continued long-term until the aneurysms resolve. all vaccines should be administered as recommended by national schedules. patients who require long-term aspirin for persistent CAA should be considered for immunisation with varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. corticosteroids are effective treatment for other forms of vasculitis. but early retrospective analyses suggested that corticosteroids were associated with increased risk of CAA. heterogeneity in corticosteroid dosing is an important consideration when translating results of Chen's meta-analysis into clinical practice. two of the methodologically strongest studies, the American paediatric Heart Network study10 and the recently reported Japanese RAISE study14 are considered in more detail. 80% of patients with KD respond to aspirin and IVIG, and CAA are most commonly seen in those who fail to respond to IVIG. a low Kobayashi score does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. however, a low Kobayashi score does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. patients with markers of severe inflammation include the very young (1-year-old); those with markers of severe inflammation, including: persistently elevated CRP despite IVIG, liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminaemia, and anaemia. echocardiographic studies performed in the first week of KD may already show vessel abnormality. a score 5 does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. the aim of treatment is to switch off the inflammatory process that is damaging the coronary arteries as rapidly as possible. the most commonly used agent is infliximab, a chimeric murine/human antibody specifically binding TNF-.63\u201366 In one retrospective study of 17 children with IVIG-resistant KD, infliximab was used successfully with abrupt defervescence in 13/16 febrile patients, with no infusion reactions. anti-TNF should be considered in patients with IVIG-resistant KD. calcineurin inhibitors (such as ciclosporin) may be applicable for treatment of KD. warfarin should be administered for at least 48 h and only stopped when warfarin has been started. the international normalised ratio (INR) is stable between two and three to avoid paradoxical thrombosis due to protein C and S depletion. patients with persistent coronary artery dilatation and aneurysms are at risk of coronary artery stenosis or thrombosis. the mortality rate for patients without cardiac sequelae in the acute phase of the disease was 2.4 times higher than the normal population. electrocardiography and echocardiography performed 6\u201312 monthly is recommended. in patients with persistent aneurysms beyond 6 weeks, long-term cardiovascular follow-up into adult life is required. 6 9 There may be echocardiographic resolution of the aneurysm over time. a statement of the American Heart Association committee on rheumatic fever, endocarditis and KD published in 2004 provided detailed guidance on the stratification of KD patients according to their relative risk of myocardial ischaemia. invasive angiography should be performed on all patients with persistent structural abnormalities of the coronary arteries. risk stratification and follow-up recommendations for children with Kawasaki disease6 Risk level Pharmacological therapy Physical activity Follow-up and diagnostic testing Level I (no coronary artery changes at any stage of illness) None beyond first 6\u20138 weeks No restrictions beyond first 6\u20138 weeks Cardiovascular risk assessment, counselling at 5-year intervals None recommended Level III (one small-medium coronary artery aneurysm/major coronary artery) activity recommendations guided by stress test/evaluation of myocardial perfusion scan outcome Biannual follow-up with echocardiogram +ECG; annual stress test/evaluation of myocardial perfusion scan 1st angiography at 6\u201312 mo or sooner if clinically indicated. repeated angiography if non-invasive test, clinical, or laboratory findings suggest ischaemia; elective repeat angiography under some circumstances. a statement of the American Heart Association committee on rheumatic fever, endocarditis and KD published in 2004 provided detailed guidance on the stratification of KD patients according to their relative risk of myocardial ischaemia. this stratification allows for patient management to be individualised with respect to medical therapy to reduce the risk of thrombosis, physical activity, frequency of clinical follow-up and diagnostic testing. at 3-year to 5\u2013year intervals None recommended Level III (one small-medium coronary artery aneurysm/major coronary artery) no restriction beyond 1st 6\u20138 weeks; patients 11\u201320 years old, physical activity guided by biennial stress test, myocardial perfusion scan; contact or high-impact sports discouraged for patients taking antiplatelet agents Annual cardiology follow-up with echocardiogram +ECG. long-term follow-up study of premature atherosclerosis/late KD vasculopathy is ongoing in the uk. invasive test, clinical, or laboratory findings suggest ischaemia; elective repeat angiography under some circumstances Level V (coronary artery obstruction) unchecked inflammation damages the vasculature in KD; acute-phase response, particularly CRP, combined with clinical response can be used to assess efficacy of any intervention. a minimum of three echocardiograms should be performed in the first 6 weeks of the illness. early echocardiography may detect extracoronary manifestations, such as mitral regurgitation or pericardial effusion, that may be associated with increased risk of CAA62. a major challenge is to coordinate transitional care of KD patients into adulthood. in the UK, this is done suboptimally, and the development of local networks to transition cardiac care from paediatrics through adolescence and into adulthood are urgently required."}
