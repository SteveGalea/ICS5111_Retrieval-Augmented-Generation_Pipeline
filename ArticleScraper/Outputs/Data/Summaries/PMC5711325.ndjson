{"summary": "CDC supports FETP development to strengthen countries\u2019 epidemiology, surveillance, and response capacity, thereby enhancing global health security through a well-trained public health workforce. since 1980, CDC has supported the launch of 45 FETPs with participants from 64 countries. as of December 2016, there were 65 FETPs in 90 countries. FETP residents contribute to ministry missions by reviewing and analyzing surveillance data, detecting and responding to disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies. they also develop skills to conduct public health research, improve communication of scientific findings, and contribute to the network of field epidemiologists locally and worldwide (9,10) rontline training for surveillance officers has been implemented throughout africa, Latin America, and elsewhere. a total of 24 new Frontline programs had been established and 1,354 surveillance staff had been trained (16). in the 1990s, directors of several FETPs organized themselves into a global network to expand program reach and to ensure program quality. FETP residents have responded to 3,300 outbreaks since 2005. 70 FETP residents and graduates from >9 african nations and Haiti participated in investigation and response activities. they served as epidemiologists, surveillance officers, contact tracing supervisors and laboratorians. an FETP in india investigated an outbreak of unexplained encephalopathy. 133 children were hospitalized and 59 (44%) died. similar outbreaks had been noticed since 1995, but multiple attempts to find a cause and control the disease failed. the FETP team redesigned the system to enable simultaneous real-time electronic reporting of suspected and confirmed cases. the system provides real-time data on MERS in Saudi Arabia and is used to populate the widely distributed, weekly Saudi MERS report that is redistributed by WHO. FETPs play critical roles in addressing priority public health problems in countries, often with the collaboration and support of international initiatives. FETP residents have broadly supported polio elimination in Nigeria and Pakistan through national stop transmission of polio (N-STOP) programs. the north waziristan area reported 20% of all global cases of polio in 2014. 70 FETP residents and graduates from >9 african nations and Haiti participated in investigation and response activities. they served as epidemiologists, surveillance officers, contact tracing supervisors, and laboratorians in support of epidemic control. outbreak of unexplained encephalopathy in which 133 children were hospitalized and 59 (44%) died. similar outbreaks had been noticed since 1995, but multiple attempts to find a cause had failed. the FETP team redesigned the system to enable real-time electronic reporting of suspected and confirmed cases. it provides real-time data on MERS in Saudi Arabia and is used to populate the widely distributed, weekly Saudi MERS report that is redistributed by WHO. FETPs also develop and support surveillance and response systems during mass gatherings for sporting, religious, and other events. FETPs play critical roles in addressing priority public health problems in countries, often with the collaboration and support of international initiatives such as the US president\u2019s emergency plan for AIDS relief (37,38), the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (39,40), and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (41,42). FETP residents have broadly supported polio elimination in Nigeria and Pakistan through National Stop Transmission of Polio (N-STOP) programs. 80% of recent graduates continue to work for the national ministry of health or equivalent. 80% of recent graduates continue to work for the national ministry of health or equivalent. 17 of the 19 programs that were established during 1980\u20132000 with CDC engagement, 17 continue to produce graduates and provide service. CDC works with programs to support these elements and to ensure their long-term success. there is a critical need for good epidemiologic science in all countries to support prevention and control programs for communicable and noncommunicable diseases. every country needs at least a minimum capacity in field epidemiology to rapidly detect, respond to, and control public health emergencies. development of FETPs across the globe is recognized as being critical for meeting that need and therefore for enhancing global health security (50)"}
