{"summary": "TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-MD-II were 4152 nt in length and included one distinctive difference from previously reported TBTV isolates. recombination analysis detected 29 recombination events in the 8 TBTV isolates. of TBTV isolates were constant while different ORF-coding regions and 3\u2019UTRs may have evolved separately. three new TBTV isolates have individual recombination patterns."}
