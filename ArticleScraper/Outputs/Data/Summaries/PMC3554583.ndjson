{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) system is the first line of host defenses against pathogen invasion, including viral infections. it protects by producing hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes that modulate diverse biological functions. a number of ISGs (such as PKR, RNase L, ISG 15, etc.) have been characterized and shown to suppress viral replication. a recent study showed that the mouse IFITM3 protein significantly restricts the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. this further underscoring the crucial role of IFITM3 in vivo [19], further underscoring the crucial role of IFITM3 in vivo. we chose the jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) envelope (Env) and IAV hemagglutinin (HA) proteins as the model system of study because of some of their advantages. we also explored the inhibitory effects of IFITM proteins on membrane fusion induced by the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) E1/E2 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G proteins. the mechanisms uncovered from this study are likely applicable to other viral fusion proteins. overexpression of IFITM proteins differentially restricts JSRV, IAV, 10A1 MLV and VSV entry Prior studies focused on IFITM3. we examined if IFITM proteins also restrict entry of JSRV. IFITM proteins differentially restrict JSRV, 10A1 MLV, IAV and VSV entry. HTX cells stably expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 were infected with indicated MLV pseudovirions bearing indicated viral glycoproteins. RNA or shRNA targeting IFITM1 or 3 [13] were infected with MLV-GFP pseudovirions bearing indicated viral glycoproteins. the infectivity was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to that of parental K562 cells (Mock) infected with same amounts of indicated pseudovirions. HTX or 293 cells do not express a significant level of endogenous IFITMs. the entry of JSRV and IAV was enhanced in K562 cells stably expressing shRNA against IFITM1 or 3. the entry of 10A1 MLV was also slightly enhanced by shRNA targeting IFITM1, but the increase was not statistically significant. soluble form of the JSRV SU-human IgG fusion protein (JSU-hFc) we performed an in vitro binding assay on HTX cells expressing individual IFITM proteins and functional human Hyal2 [27], [28], [29], [41]. this indicates that expression of IFITM proteins did not affect binding of JSRV Env to HTX cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor. expression of IFITM proteins, including IFITM1, does not affect binding of JSRV Env to cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor on the cell surface. expression of IFITM proteins does not affect binding of JSRV Env to cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor. expression of IFITM proteins on the surface of HTX cells was examined by an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. the expression was examined by an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. shedding of JSRV SU in the presence or absence of a soluble form of Hyal2 is an important indicator of Hyal2 receptor-mediated triggering for the fusion activation of JSRV Env. the total levels of JSRV Env expression in these radiolabeled cells were approximately equivalent, as evidenced by the intensities of Env precursors and processed TMs. 93 cells overexpressing Hyal2 observed almost complete syncytia formation (100%) induced by JSRV Env and IAV HA within 5\u201310 min after a pH 5.0 pulse. syncytia formation was substantially reduced in 293/LH2SN cells expressing IFITM1, but the reduction was much less in cells expressing IFITM3. Flow cytometry analysis of 293T cells co-expressing JSRV Env and WT IFITM proteins showed that the levels of JSRV Env on the surface of IFITM-expressing cells were comparable to that of the mock control. expression of IFITM proteins or treatment of cells with IFN suppresses syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding JSRV Env, IAV HA, or 10A1 MLV Env with the R peptide deleted. cells were exposed to a pH 5.0 buffer for 1 min or left untreated and examined for syncytia formation. lowering the pH (pH 4.0) or incubating 293 cells with an increased concentration of sHyal2 did not overcome the restriction on fusion. syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env or IAV HA was greatly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. however, 10A1 MLV Env-mediated syncytia formation was not significantly affected by the IFN-2b treatment. no cytotoxicity was observed during the 24-h IFN treatment period. effector 293T/GFP cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding JSRV Env. the next day, cells were co-cultured with CMTMR (red)-labeled HTX/LH2SN cells expressing indicated IFITM proteins. fusion was examined by fluorescence microscopy (A) and flow cytometry (B) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding JSRV Env plus IFITM1. cells were co-cultured with target cells, either parental HTX/LH2SN (columns 1 and 3, Mock) or HTX/LH2SN stably expressing IFITM1. we expressed IFITM1 in effector cells, in HTX/LH2SN target cells. we compared effects on JSRV Env-induced cell-cell fusion. a critical question is whether the cell-cell fusion assay employed here is relevant to endosomal fusion. filomycin A1 (BafA1) followed by a pH-5.0 pulse for 5\u201310 min. cells were allowed for infection for 4 h in the presence of BafA1. low pH treatment did not increase the JSRV titer in HTX/IFITM1 cells. IFITM1 and 3 strongly inhibited membrane fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins. the efficiency was generally low, consistent with the results of syncytia formation and the GFP-transfer cell-cell fusion assay. COS7/LH2SN cells (Mock) or derivatives expressing indicated IFITM proteins were infected with GFP-encoding MoMLV pseudovirions bearing JSRV Env. viral infectivity was determined by flow cytometry as described in Fig. 1. CPZ does not overcome the block of cell-cell fusion induced by IFITM proteins. we used conditions that allow fusion to proceed up to and through the point of hemifusion while preventing steps that lead to pore formation. we created an intermediate of fusion, referred to as a cold arrested state (CAS) hemifusion occurred for the IFITM-expressing cells. the greater amount of dye spread upon raising temperature indicated that the IFITM proteins in the target cell membrane block the creation of hemifusion. CPZ does not rescue the restriction of IFITMs on cell-cell fusion of viral fusion proteins. Raising temperature led to calcein transfer to only one of the four target cells. adding CPZ did not lead to calcein-AM transfer to any of the three target cells. similar experimental procedures were applied to IFITM2 and 3-expressing cells. the presence of IFITMs likely blocks hemifusion by making the spontaneous curvature more negative prior to creating CAS promotes JSRV Env-mediated hemifusion. the addition of OA before creating CAS promoted aqueous dye transfer upon either addition of CPZ (A) or raising temperature to 37\u00b0C from CAS (B) higher GP values and longer lifetimes indicate membranes are more molecularly ordered, while lower GP values and shorter lifetimes mark membranes as less molecularly ordered [52] in mock control cells, the GP distribution was characterized by two peaks, one with a lower GP, associated with intracellular membranes, and another with a higher GP, identified with plasma membranes. the less ordered populations were predominant in the mock controls. the GP scale was restricted from 0.3 to 0.5. the lower GP values are associated with internal membranes. the higher GP values are associated with plasma membranes. overexpression of IFITM proteins increases the lipid packing order of cell membranes. this increases the lipid packing order of cell membranes and makes them less fluid and possibly less competent for membrane fusion. IFITM1 caused the greatest restriction of JSRV entry (p0.01). all three IFITM proteins were expressed in both HTX and 293 cells. IFITM3 showed a relatively low level of expression in HTX cells. HTX cells stably expressing IFITM1, 2 or 3 were infected with indicated viral glycoproteins. HTX cells stably expressing control shRNA or shRNA targeting IFITM1 or 3 [13] were infected with indicated viral glycoproteins. the infectivity was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to that of parental K562 cells (Mock) infected with same amounts of indicated pseudovirions. entry of 10A1 MLV was also slightly but consistently blocked by the IFN-2b treatment. the greater inhibitory effect of IFN on IAV and VSV entry into 293 cells was unexpected because IFITM proteins had higher levels when overexpressed than when induced by IFN. cytotoxicity was observed for doses of IFN applied during the viral infection period. IFITM expression does not affect binding of JSRV Env to its Hyal2 receptor or receptor-mediated priming for fusion activation IFITM1 has been previously shown to be associated with caveolin-1. the protein is known to play an essential role in caveolin-mediated endocytosis [37], [38]. expression of IFITM proteins, including IFITM1, does not affect binding of JSRV Env to cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor on the cell surface. expression of IFITM proteins does not affect binding of JSRV Env to cells expressing the Hyal2 receptor. the fluorescence intensities of three independent experiments were averaged and plotted. expression of IFITM proteins on the surface of HTX cells was examined by an anti-FLAG antibody. we performed metabolic labeling of 293T cells co-expressing IFITMs and JSRV Env. we determined shedding of JSRV SU in the presence or absence of a soluble form of Hyal2 (sHyal2). the levels of JSRV SU harvested from the culture media were comparable to those of parental cells. the total levels of JSRV Env expression in these radiolabeled cells were approximately equivalent. almost complete syncytia formation (100%) induced by JSRV Env and IAV HA within 5\u201310 min after a pH 5.0 pulse. in contrast, very little syncytia formation was detected in 293/LH2SN cells expressing IFITM1. Flow cytometry analysis of 293T cells co-expressing JSRV Env and WT IFITM proteins showed that the levels of JSRV Env on the surface of IFITM-expressing cells were comparable to that of the mock control. expression of IFITM proteins or treatment of cells with IFN suppresses syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding JSRV Env, IAV HA, or 10A1 MLV Env. cells were exposed to a pH 5.0 buffer for 1 min or left untreated. lowering the pH (pH 4.0) or incubating 293 cells with an increased concentration of sHyal2 did not overcome the IFITM1-mediated restriction on fusion. syncytia formation induced by JSRV Env or IAV HA was greatly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. in contrast, 10A1 MLV Env-mediated syncytia formation was not significantly affected by the IFN-2b treatment. IFITM2 and 3 also suppressed cell-cell fusion, but with much less efficiency. the sizes of fused cells in parental HTX/LH2SN cells were much larger than those of fused cells in IFITM1-expressing cells. the percentage of fusion reduction measured by flow cytometry underestimated the inhibitory effect of IFITM proteins. effector 293T/GFP cells were transfected with a plasmid alone (columns 1 and 2) or plasmids encoding JSRV Env plus IFITM1 (columns 3 and 4); cells were co-cultured with CMTMR-labeled target cells, either parental HTX/LH2SN (columns 1 and 3, Mock) or HTX/LH2SN stably expressing IFITM1 we expressed IFITM1 in 293T/GFP effector cells, in HTX/LH2SN target cells, or in both, and compared their effects on JSRV Env-induced cell-cell fusion. the inhibition of cell-cell fusion by IFITM1 is not specifically related to its expression in effector or target cells. cells with 20 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) followed by a pH-5.0 pulse for 5\u201310 min; cells were allowed for infection for 4 h in the presence of BafA1. low pH treatment did not increase the JSRV titer in HTX/IFITM1 cells to a level that was similar to that of parental HTX cells. IFITM1 and 3 inhibited membrane fusion induced by all three classes of viral fusion proteins. but the efficiency was generally low (Fig. 5A, B and C) surprisingly, we observed that when the JSRV Env protein was expressed as effector, Env-mediated fusion was also markedly suppressed by IFITM3. COS7/LH2SN cells (Mock) or derivatives expressing indicated IFITM proteins were infected with GFP-encoding MoMLV pseudovirions bearing JSRV Env or IAV HA/NA. flow cytometry profiles are shown in Fig. 1. CPZ does not overcome the block of cell-cell fusion induced by IFITM proteins. we used conditions that allow fusion to proceed up to and through the point of hemifusion while preventing steps that lead to pore formation. we created an intermediate of fusion, referred to as a cold arrested state (CAS) CPZ showed that little hemifusion occurred for the IFITM-expressing cells. the greater amount of dye spread upon raising temperature indicated that the IFITM proteins in the target cell membrane block the creation of hemifusion. but it is possible that the decrease in membrane fluidity caused by IFITM proteins inhibits lipids from rearranging into a hemifusion configurations. addition of CPZ led to calcein-AM transfer to only one of the four target cells. similar experimental procedures were applied to IFITM2 and 3-expressing cells. negative curvature-promoting lipid, oleic acid (OA) effectively rescues IFITM-mediated suppression of viral membrane fusion. the presence of IFITMs likely blocks hemifusion by making the spontaneous curvature more negative prior to creating CAS promotes JSRV Env-mediated hemifusion. the addition of OA before creating CAS promoted aqueous dye transfer upon either addition of CPZ (A) or raising temperature to 37\u00b0C from CAS (B) higher GP values and longer lifetimes indicate membranes are more molecularly ordered, while lower GP values and shorter lifetimes mark membranes as less molecularly ordered [52] in mock control cells, the GP distribution was characterized by two peaks, one with a lower GP, associated with intracellular membranes. the less ordered populations were predominant in the mock controls. the GP function is a normalized ratio between the blue and the green channels. the lower GP values are associated with internal membranes. the higher GP values are associated with plasma membranes. overexpression of IFITM proteins dramatically increases the lipid packing order of cell membranes. this makes them less fluid and possibly less competent for membrane fusion. syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion experiments showed that JSRV Env-mediated fusion at low pH was profoundly inhibited by IFITM1. ncytia formation and cell-cell fusion assays employed in this study can reflect the situation of viral membrane fusion in endosomes. we observed that IFITM1 was also generally more effective than IFITM2 and 3 in suppressing syncytia formation induced by IAV HA and VSV-G. the exact mechanism underlying these observations is currently unknown, but could be related, in part, to the relatively higher levels of IFITM1 expression on the cell surface the extent of aqueous dye spread in target cells expressing IFITM proteins was much less upon CPZ addition or on raising the temperature from CAS than was fusion induced by lowering pH at 37\u00b0C. this is because the effects caused by adding CPZ or raising the temperature were qualitatively similar for JSRV Env and IAV HA. the increase in lipid order of IFITM-expressing cells correlates with the potency of IFITMs in suppressing viral membrane fusion. the increase in lipid order of IFITM-expressing cells, particularly in their plasma membranes, correlates with the potency of IFITMs in suppressing viral membrane fusion. IFITM proteins may directly change membrane curvature by adopting an unconventional membrane topology or topologies that function as a wedge to generate positive spontaneous curvature. results of continuum membrane mechanics show that the spontaneous curvature of the monolayer of the target membrane proximal to the membrane expressing the fusion proteins (i.e., outer leaflets) affects hemifusion. some transmembrane proteins, including those of viral glycoproteins, adopt dual or dynamic topologies because of \u201clipid flip-flop\u201d and/or changes in the net charge of their cytosolic sequences. it is therefore possible that IFITM proteins, including their orthologs in different species which differ significantly at the N- and C-termini [11], adopt distinct topologies.
