{"summary": "the global public health intelligence network (GPHIN) was established to increase situational awareness and capacity for the early detection of emerging public health events. the GPHIN analyzes over 20,000 online news reports (over 30,000 sources) in nine languages worldwide. an alert is sent out if a potential risk is identified. the GPHIN relies on an automated web-based system that scans newspapers and other communications worldwide for potential indicators of outbreaks. when a risk is identified, analysts disseminate relevant information and alerts to senior officials and stakeholders for decision-making. the GPHIN and Big Data Big Data have been defined by three V\u2019s: volume, velocity and variety (7,8). web-based application in the GPHIN system continuously scans and mines acquired news sources worldwide in nine languages. the quantity of data generated is dependent on the criteria, variables and algorithms outlined for the aggregators (6). each day, on average, the GPHIN processes 3,000 news reports (9) the GPHIN system retrieves relevant data from the news aggregators every 15 minutes. it is able to complete the processing (including translation) of the data in less than one minute (9). it was initially demonstrated during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. ongoing monitoring The GPHIN was credited with being the first to issue an alert about this new emerging illness. ongoing monitoring is critical for situational awareness regarding the evolution of an outbreak and the response and mitigation strategies being implemented by the local, national and international communities. the IHRs note that the WHO may include reports from sources other than official notifications or consultations in their assessment of a potential emerging public health event (14). over the years, the GPHIN has continued to detect early signals of outbreaks of international concern such as the pandemic influenza H1N1 in 2009 (16). initial Spanish language reports about the outbreak noted an unusual respiratory outbreak in the state of Veracruz, Mexico that had claimed two lives. social media tools (such as Twitter and Facebook) have witnessed exponential growth over the last 10 years. these platforms create huge amounts of user-generated content and data. these social media tools represent potential new data sources for the GPHIN. mobile technology is expanding significantly so this may help address concerns about representativeness. the use of social media poses ethical considerations associated with the rights of individuals, including privacy issues. social media has improved emergency response by providing real-time data capture about the health of communities (23) and the public response to an event (24). social media has improved emergency response by providing real-time data capture about the health of communities (23) and the public response to an event (24) ning the aggregators and algorithms used which could potentially result in more advanced forms of artificial intelligence. the GPHIN\u2019s analytical capacity will enable the robust management, integration, analysis and interpretation of increasingly large and complex volumes of data (31)."}
