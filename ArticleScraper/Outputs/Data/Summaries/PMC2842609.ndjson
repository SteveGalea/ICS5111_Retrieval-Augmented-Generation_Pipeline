{"summary": "the ability to forecast, understand and control the spread of infectious diseases increasingly depends on the capacity to formulate and test mathematical models capturing key mechanisms. the nonlinear stochastic dynamical models arising in the study of infectious disease dynamics have proved relatively recalcitrant. as general approaches, all of the methods mentioned earlier face severe limitations. some must modify the model, discretizing time to the scale of observations. some must modify the model, discretizing time to the scale of observations. plug-and-play inference methodology provides a powerful tool to enable carrying out data analysis via flexible, scientifically motivated classes of models. plug-and-play is extremely useful when one wishes to entertain multiple working hypotheses translated into multiple mechanistic models. in optimization theory, methods requiring only evaluation of the objective function have been called gradient-free (Spall 2003). measles has occupied a central place in mathematical epidemiology. we illustrate our new approach via a case study of measles transmission dynamics. a focus on this well-studied disease allows us to compare our conclusions. inference machinery, data and models Consider a time series y1:N y1,...,yN. a stochastic model for y1:N implies a joint density f(y1:N|) given a vector of unknown parameters, where is in Rn. the log-likelihood function is given by. adopt the maximum-likelihood approach of Ionides et al. (2006, 2009), which enables statistically efficient inference for general nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. the approximations developed by Liu & West (2001) are not statistically efficient, and lead to additional bias and variance in the resulting parameter estimates. the data we analyse consist of weekly measles case reports on 20 representative communities with population sizes ranging from 2000 to 3 000 000. a basic susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013recovered model for measles divides the population into those individuals susceptible to infection, exposed (i.e. infected but not yet infectious), infectious and removed (i.e. quarantined or recovered and subsequently immune) a diagram such as figure 2 can be unambiguously interpreted as a deterministic system, a system with demographic stochasticity or a system with both demographic and extra-demographic stochasticity. the transition rates in a model such as figure 2 may, in general, depend on the state of the system. for i in 1,...,k, generate process increments where pij = pij(ij(tn, X(tn)),ij) is given by with ij = ij(t, x), defined in equation (A 2). Here (t) is the transmission rate; the mean number of infectives visiting the population at any given time; a mixing parameter, with = 1 corresponding to homogeneous mixing. a new feature of our model is that we add white noise with intensity SE to the transmission process. a fraction c of recruits into the susceptible class enter on the school admission day. the reporting process is taken to be on over-dispersed binomial. ij = 0, Gamma(/ij2, ij2) is defined to take the non-. further details on the gamma, multinomial and Poisson distributions can be found in introductory texts on probability and statistics. in steps 5 and 7, Ri counts the number of individuals in compartment i during the current Euler increment. the parameters = 4 yr and m = 0.02 yr1 were not estimated. other parameters and their units are as specified in table 1. profile likelihood plots over for London and Hastings are presented in figure 3. this may suggest that there is little evidence for inhomogeneity of transmission in the data. the dashed lines construct approximately 95 per cent CIs of (0.93, 1.03) for London. the imported infection parameter is well identified in these data. there is a strong log-linear relationship between and N. the evidence for such a relationship is stronger here than in a previous empirical investigation. model compensates for lack of extra-demographic stochasticity by attempting to increase the intensity of demographic stochasticity. the model calls for short infectious periods and high transmissibility to reproduce the explosive epidemics and interepidemic fadeouts typical of small communities. the oversimple model can reproduce these features only by extending the infectious period and reducing transmissibility. deterministic versions of the mass-action model analysed here do a remarkably good job of qualitatively reproducing the dynamics of measles in large communities. et al. 2005 decreases the estimated 95 per cent CI of R0 to (25, 41) for London. but it does not alter the qualitative conclusion that homogeneous population models require high values of R0 in order to be consistent with the data. clinical and household studies of infectious diseases yield information about transmission and progression of infection on the scale of individuals or families. the recent development of likelihood-based approaches capable of dealing with the full spectrum of unavoidable complexities. if biological quantities estimated in this way agree with those estimated from clinical or household studies, it can be interpreted as confirmation of assumptions embodied in the model. estimates of R0 (or any other single quantity) derived from fitting a simple model to one sort of data should agree with estimates derived from other data sources. the key question should be: which biological interpretations are relevant in the context of the data used to inform the model. lag is explicitly captured in our model by the delay, between birth and recruitment into the susceptible pool. existing estimates of R0 are sensitive to assumptions about the age structure of transmission that have not yet been fully resolved. progress on inference methodology for parameter estimation from measles time series has emphasized SEIR-type models for homogeneous populations. the study of age structure and spatial effects for measles has placed less emphasis on inferring parameters from data. filtering operations (the computationally intensive step in the iterated filtering algorithm) have been carried out on systems with 5 106 state variables. this is the first scientific investigation based on a new framework for continuous-time, discrete-state population dynamics with both demographic and extra-demographic noise. superspreading has been documented in measles, but is of greater dynamic importance in other diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. the flexibility of plug-and-play methodology holds the potential to encourage the development of scientifically appropriate models."}
