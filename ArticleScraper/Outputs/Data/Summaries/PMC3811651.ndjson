{"summary": "in 1970, the world health organization estimated that the destruction caused by a theoretical attack with 50 kg of aerosolized Bacillus anthracis could incur between 150,000 and 250,000 incapacitating casualties. 100 kg of Bacillus anthracis has the potential to cause up to 3 million deaths, a mortality rate that would match the predicted lethality of a hydrogen bomb. broad-range assays can generate species-specific amplicons while employing relatively few PCRs. these species-specific amplicons can subsequently be differentiated with sequencing or other genotyping technologies to identify unambiguously a wide array of organisms. RT-PCR coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is an alternative to previously validated individual NAATs. detection is sufficiently sensitive to allow recognition of multiple products from a single PCR. RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS may be able to provide accurate detection of both BT and common pathogens in clinical samples with RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS. positive and negative samples were collected from the clinical microbiology laboratory between 3 august 2010 and 17 February 2011. subsets of samples were selected by a study coordinator to create a panel of BAL fluid specimens enriched for a variety of organisms. a second study coordinator randomly spiked 6 to 8 fg of either Bacillus anthracis DNA (n = 40), Yersinia pestis DNA (n = 40), Francisella tularensis DNA (n = 40 samples were collected, deidentified, and processed in accordance with a study protocol approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. adenovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were not included in the comparison. ms that are part of the normal microbiota were not considered a cause of infection if detected by reference culture techniques at concentrations of 1,000 CFU/ml. residual BAL fluid samples were kept at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. after thawing, viral nucleic acids were extracted from 300 l of remnant BAL fluid using a robot. the RVS 2.5 kit uses 16 primer pairs to detect and to subtype 6 groups of viruses (RSV, influenza virus A and B, PIV 1 to 3, adenovirus A to F, coronaviruses, and hMPVs) the BAC kit includes 18 broad-range primer pairs that can identify over 400 species of bacteria and yeast. the BD kit includes 36 primers (3 of which are broad-range primers shared with the BAC kit) RT-PCR products were analyzed with the Ibis T5000 universal biosensor platform (Ibis Biosciences, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) each PCR mixture underwent an automated weak anion exchange protocol for desalting and purification. all detections with values of >0.85 were reported. scores of 0.85 were considered indeterminate. RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS results were compared with spiking patterns. positive and negative samples were collected from the clinical microbiology laboratory. a second study coordinator randomly spiked 6 to 8 fg of either Bacillus anthracis DNA (n = 40), Yersinia pestis DNA (n = 40), Francisella tularensis DNA (n = 40), or 0.1 mM EDTA (negative spiking; n = 66) into the respiratory samples prior to RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS testing. aliquots of BAL fluid were subjected to Gram staining and 10 l was used for plating on each media. aliquots of BAL fluid were subjected to Gram staining. the xTAG RVP assay is capable of detecting rhinoviruses. spp., Haemophilus spp., and Haemophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella [HACEK] organisms were not considered a cause of infection if they were detected by reference culture techniques at concentrations of 1,000 CFU/ml in the setting of heavy normal microbiota (10,000 CFU/ml) the RVS 2.5 kit uses 16 primer pairs to detect and to subtype 6 groups of viruses. the BAC kit includes 18 broad-range primer pairs that can identify over 400 species of bacteria and yeast. the BD kit includes 36 primers (3 of which are broad-range primers shared with the BAC kit) RT-PCR products were analyzed with the Ibis T5000 universal biosensor platform. each PCR mixture underwent an automated weak anion exchange protocol for desalting and purification. all detections with values of >0.85 were reported. scores of 0.85 were considered indeterminate.

Table 2. Summary of sensitivity, specificity, and concordance for detection of BT and common pathogens. the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS for the BT spikes were 98.5% (95% CI, 94.2 to 99.7%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 93.1 to 100.0%), respectively. BT DNA had been included in 52 samples that were cultured or PCR positive for two or more organisms. Klebsiella oxytoca (>10,000 CFU/ml by culture and 1,729 genomes/well by RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS) and Enterococcus faecalis (5,200 CFU/ml by culture and 13 genomes/well by RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS) a total of 212 naturally occurring pathogens, representing 38 species, were detected by reference culture methods. RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS detected a Candida species in 58.1% of these samples (18/31 samples) for a sensitivity of 58.1% (assuming that Candida was the yeast for which the species was not identified) a total of 145 BAL fluid specimens were cultured for fungal pathogens after initial Gram staining findings. normal microbiota quantified at 10,000 CFU/ml was excluded as a contributing naturally occurring organism. of these samples, 53 contained mixtures of only bacteria, 18 contained mixtures of fungal pathogens, 2 contained mixtures of fungal pathogens, and 1 contained a mixture of a virus with a fungal pathogen. 67 were blindly spiked with blanks (0.1 mM EDTA); all samples were processed with the BD assay. 94 BAL fluid specimens were processed with the RVS 2.5 kit. the sensitivity of the research assay for each pathogen is shown. lla spp. 5/5 (100) 82.6 10.2 Rickettsia prowazekii (spiked) 5/5 (100) 64.8 12.6 Burkholderia spp. (spiked) 5/5 (100) 458.2 261.0 All spiked organisms 115.8 114.4 Achromobacter spp. 1/1 (100) 0/1 59 Acinetobacter baumannii 1/1 (100) 0/1 59 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19/25 (76.0) 6/15 440.1 940.5 Non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas 1/1 (100) 0/1 76 Serratia marcescens 3/4 (75.0) 1/2 129.5 135.2 Non-marcescens Serratia 1/1 (100) 0/1 130 Staphylococcus aureus 25/33 (75.8) 6/18 191.64 314.7 Steno RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS detection performance with monomicrobial versus polymicrobial samplesa Background No. of samples identified as positive by reference test (% [95% CI]) BT agents Bacterial pathogens Fungal pathogens Monomicrobial (no other organisms) 82/83 (98.8 [92.3\u201399.9]) 35/38 (92.1 [77.5\u201397.9]) 10/10 (100 [65.5\u2013100]) sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS for the BT spikes were 98.5% (95% CI, 94.2 to 99.7%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 93.1 to 100.0%), respectively. the average quantity of DNA detected by RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS quantification from a 6- to 8-fg spike was 116 genomes per well. a total of 212 naturally occurring pathogens, representing 38 species, were detected by reference culture methods. sensitivity and specificity for each category of pathogen (bacterial, viral, and fungal) are detailed below and presented in Table 2. ninety-three percent of samples (14/15 samples) were positive for a concordant virus by RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS, resulting in a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% CI, 66.0 to 99.7%) a total of 145 BAL fluid specimens were cultured for fungal pathogens after initial Gram staining findings. normal microbiota quantified at 10,000 CFU/ml was excluded as a contributing naturally occurring organism. 53 samples contained mixtures of only bacteria, 18 contained mixtures of fungal pathogens, 2 contained mixtures of fungal pathogens, and 1 contained a mixture of a virus with a fungal pathogen. the sensitivities of BT, bacterial, viral, and fungal detection in polymicrobial samples are detailed in Table 3. RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS can provide accurate detection of BT organisms in clinical samples despite potential interference from complicated endogenous polymicrobial matrices. the broad-range capabilities of this platform provide diagnostic utility for common pathogens. BT identification was highly accurate even in specimens with multiple naturally occurring respiratory organisms. a real-world application of this technology would assume a validated nucleic acid extraction protocol for BT agents. in addition to BT infections, common respiratory infections have nonspecific symptoms that do not readily suggest a causative pathogen (28). RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS research assay detected both Candida krusei and PIV 3, but results were available within 7 h. the RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS platform demonstrated the capacity to distinguish polymicrobial infections. analysis of samples that contained multiple organisms revealed a significantly higher rate of false-negative bacterial detections than in single-agent samples. this observation was likely the effect of interference from the background polymicrobial matrices. initial costs associated with deployment of RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS are substantial and can pose an additional barrier to routine implementation in clinical laboratories. sensitivity and specificity for common bacterial and fungal detection are still suboptimal and do not warrant the use of RT-PCR\u2013ESI-MS as a stand-alone diagnostic testing platform. future studies may include different or modified primer sequences to better target commonly encountered respiratory pathogens."}
