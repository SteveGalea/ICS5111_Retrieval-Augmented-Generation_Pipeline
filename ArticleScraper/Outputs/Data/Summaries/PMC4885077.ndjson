{"summary": "DENV causes an estimated 50\u2013100 million cases of dengue fever, 500,000 cases of severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) and more than 20,000 deaths each year in tropical and subtropical regions. there are still no specific antiviral drugs or licensed vaccines against DENV. DENV RNA displays two pairs of complementary sequences (CS) required for genome circularization and viral replication. downstream 5\u2032 CS pseudoknot (DCS-PK) elements enhance viral RNA replication by regulating cyclization. DENV is internalized into cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. the low pH induces structural changes in the E protein. the positive-stranded viral RNA is then released into the cytoplasm. NS proteins then replicate the viral RNA. pre-membrane (prM) protein is cleaved by the cellular serine protease furin. replicon system does not contain a reporter gene for analysis of the level of DENV RNA replication [16]. DVRep harbors a firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene to replace the structural proteins. the luciferase was fused to the N-terminal 34 amino acids of the C protein. the RNA supports stable expression of reporter and nonstructural (NS) proteins; (d) full-length reporter replicons that produce infectious viral particles. a replicon is established by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA. some reports have described DNA-based replicons, in which transcription is controlled by a cytomegalovirus promoter prepared from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Alphavirus), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Arterivirus), and DENV. the reporter within the DENV replicon contained Rluc ubiquitin, a selectable neomycin-resistance (neo) gene, and an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site fragment. this was substituted for the viral structural genes to construct a replicon fragment that retained the 37 N-terminal amino acids of the C protein and 31 C-terminal amino acids of the E protein. VLPs are composed of an RNA reporter replicon genome that is packaged into virus particles by the viral structural proteins (C, prM, and E proteins) when provided in trans. they exhibit a structure similar to that of infectious live virus particles and can be used to study the entry and replication steps of the viral life cycle. DV-R infection is suppressed by heparin, an entry inhibitor, and replication abolished by an adenosine analog. titers at 24 and 48 h were significantly lower than those of the parent strain. DV-R provides a useful tool for investigating all steps of the virus life cycle. the viral titer from culture supernatants was lower than the parent virus. luciferase activity was increased from the third to fifth rounds of passage. adaptive mutation in NS4B gene could enhance viral RNA replication. despite this limitation, the GFP-expressing replicon system still provides benefits for the study of DENV. for the DENV-Fluc, susceptibility to the well-characterized anti-DENV inhibitors mycophenolic acid (MPA), NITD008 and type I and III interferons is similar to that of parent DENV in mice. the development of the DENV replicon cell culture system is one of the most significant advances in DENV basic research and antiviral discovery. full-length reporter viruses are also useful tools for screening of inhibitors that affect all steps of the DENV life cycle and for examination of the mechanism of DENV replication."}
