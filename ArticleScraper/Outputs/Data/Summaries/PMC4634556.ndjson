{"summary": "1, 2 Seasonal migration of infected wild birds and trade in live poultry 3 have spread H5N1 viruses across Asia, Europe and Africa. direct transmission of this avian virus to humans through contact with infected live birds, poultry products or excreta caused 154 confirmed human deaths by November 2006. proportion immune () within a particular population determines the effective reproductive number (R) by the relationship: R 0 provides a worstcase scenario for the attack rate. in combination with the mean generation time (serial interval between cases) and the proportion susceptible, R 0 determines the rate of spread of an outbreak. proportion immune () within a particular population determines the effective reproductive number (R) by the relationship: R 0 provides a worstcase scenario for the attack rate. in combination with the mean generation time (serial interval between cases) and the proportion susceptible, R 0 determines the rate of spread of an outbreak. interpandemic viruses circulate in partially immune populations. cytotoxic Tcells kill virusinfected epithelial cells to clear existing infections. a hyperactive cytotoxic response against these cells can cause lung destruction and death. HI antibody thresholds conferring protection differed for the three strains circulating over the period: A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B. 28, 29 Such variation is likely due to differences in the immunogenicity of HA antigens. 22, 31, 32 Broadly reactive \u2018recall\u2019 immune responses, seen within days of vaccination, 33 could explain the rarity of H1N1 infection in Seattle adults with low HI titres. 28 Ferguson et al. modelled the combined effects of waning immunity and antigenic drift for interpandemic virus by assuming that a single exposure to influenza protected against related strains for 5 years. less robust immune responses in the very young and elderly were modelled by shortening this duration of protection. this could explain the second wave of infections observed on Tristan da Cunha. virus titres in nasal lavage fluid rise at 24 hours, peak with fever onset at 48 hours, and then decline over the next 5 days. 40, 41 In children with natural infections, viral titres continue to rise 24\u201348 hours after symptom onset. 43 Elderly and immunocompromised patients can shed virus for weeks or even months. severe\u2019 cases shed more virus and are thus more infectious is questionable. the average serial interval between cases could be longer for transmissions occurring in the community, if there is continuing access to susceptibles. longini et al. allow for a similar mean latent phase of 148 days. but shorten the duration of peak infectiousness to give a serial interval of 26 days. 10, 11 More recent work from the Longini group assumed a slightly longer generation time of 35 days. HI antibody thresholds conferring protection differed for the three strains circulating over the period: A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B. 28, 29 Such variation is likely due to differences in the immunogenicity of HA antigens. 22, 31, 32 Broadly reactive \u2018recall\u2019 immune responses, seen within days of vaccination, 33 could explain the rarity of H1N1 infection in Seattle adults with low HI titres. interpandemic could explain the second wave of infections observed on Tristan da Cunha. 33% of islanders experienced a second (usually milder) attack within a month of the initial outbreak. 40, 41 In children with natural infections, viral titres continue to rise 24\u201348 hours after symptom onset. 43 Elderly and immunocompromised patients can shed virus for weeks or even months. 44 Conversely, of cases detected during epidemic influenza seasons, perhaps a third are asymptomatic 29, 45 and uncertain infectious potential. a mode of 2 days between the onset of symptoms in successively infected household members was reported during pandemics in 1890 7 and 1918\u20131919. the average serial interval between cases could be longer for transmissions occurring in the community, if there is continuing access to susceptibles. more recent work from the Longini group assumed a slightly longer generation time of 35 days. assumptions about mixing Opportunities for disease transmission differ by social situation, and location, as seen in the Kelley's island outbreak of 1920. 68 records from 1919 also reveal higher infection rates in occupations involving travel and frequent contact with the public. 69 Ferguson et al. employ this method to characterize close mixing in schools and aged care institutions. the effects of school closures on communitywide influenza transmission are not well defined. school contacts were found to be important in disease spread. a decline in incidence followed school closure (Figure 5). neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir antagonize the action of neuraminidase. zanamivir and oseltamivir impair release of virions from host cells. 84 although effective in prophylaxis and in reducing severity and duration of symptoms in interpandemic influenza, the use of these drugs has produced little benefit in H5N1 influenza. 94 Influenza virus resistance to oseltamivir is of potential concern, 95 but at present can be demonstrated in less than 0.5% of strains worldwide. 96 Mutants arising in vitro can have mutations in both HA and NA genes, 97. those from treated immunocompetent patients show single mutations in the NA region. 106, 107 Reinfection has also been observed in untreated children. adult clinical trials of antiviral agents consistently show that virologically confirmed cases are prevented more effectively than serologically confirmed cases. 89, 106, 109 indicates sufficient exposure for seroconversion without illness. 124 Reduced protection against heterologous influenza strains has been shown in challenge studies. 125, 126 could explain why some immunogenic vaccines perform poorly in the field. 128 Strategic vaccine use An efficient use of pandemic influenza vaccines would be to control transmission through herd immunity. 137 models have explored the theoretical effectiveness of targeted immunization for pandemic control, showing optimal benefit from vaccinating children of school 63, 138 and preschool age. such models depend upon assumptions about population susceptibility and transmission in heterogeneous circumstances. providers coincided with a 2week teachers\u2019 strike during the epidemic influenza season in Israel. 78 Historically, the likely benefit of closing schools was thought to depend on the household living conditions to which children would be returned. models exploring this intervention are sensitive to assumptions about agespecific transmission rates in the school compared with rates in the home. 91, 92 Prophylaxis with NAIs can reduce the risk of infection in household contacts, 93 with efficacy of 60\u201380%. 93 Published models of scenarios using antivirals to limit spread of pandemic influenza have used estimates of prophylactic efficacy based on such data. 10, 11, 55, 56, 63 The maximum achievable reduction in infectiousness as a result of treatment has been estimated at 28%. zanamivir resistance 102 may relate to the poor in vitro viability of strains with this mutation. 37 Intriguingly, a high rate of production of poorly transmissible mutants could aid, rather than hinder, outbreak control. prophylaxis-based strategies favour selection of mutant strains, 37. 113, 114 Candidate H5 vaccines have afforded protection in neutralization assays 115 and animal models against variant H5 viruses. 116, 117 Such \u2018best guess\u2019 vaccines can be stockpiled for possible use in priming critical subpopulations. there will likely be substantial delays in production and supply shortages of strainspecific vaccines due to limited global manufacturing capacity. in the simplest models, immunization moves all vaccinated susceptibles to the removed/recovered class. this critical distinction determines the threshold size of an epidemic. 136 Vaccine effects can be characterized further within subgroups of interest identified from clinical trials. the risk of a new human pandemic can be linked to both the emergence of avian influenza and to the large numbers of people on the planet. the risk of a new human pandemic can be linked to both the emergence of avian influenza, and to the large numbers of people on the planet. documents from the 1889\u20131891 and 1918\u20131919 pandemics give individual and group level data on influenza morbidity and mortality. conflict of interest J.D.M. has advised the Australian
