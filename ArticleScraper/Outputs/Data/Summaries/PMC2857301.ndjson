{"summary": "bats of 2 species were sampled at 4 sites in the Rocky Mountain region in 2006. eight occult myotis (Myotis occultus) and 1 Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) were captured in mist nets as they emerged from a roost in a building in mancos in southwestern Colorado. each bat was sampled within 5\u201310 minutes of capture and then released. if possible, 3 sample types were taken from each bat. fecal samples were collected if the bat produced a fresh bolus. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription (RT) RNA from 140 L of each of the 79 samples was extracted by using the QIamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. extracted RNA was eluted in 50 L of RNase-free water and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. 5 L from each PCR was amplified in a 50-L reaction with primer 2 and primer 3 (5\u2032-GTTGTACTGCTAGTGACAGG-3\u2032) water controls in all RT-PCRs did not show false-positive results. for each positive specimen, amplicons from 2 independent RT-PCRs were sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer. sample collection bats were sampled at 4 sites in the Rocky Mountain region in 2006. eight occult myotis (Myotis occultus) and 1 Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) were captured in mist nets as they emerged from a roost in a building in southwestern Colorado. d bats were trapped in mist nets during the nights of August 14\u201320. each bat was sampled within 5\u201310 minutes of capture and then released. if possible, 3 sample types were taken from each bat. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription (RT) RNA from 140 L of each of the 79 samples was extracted by using the QIamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 5 L from each PCR was amplified in a 50-L reaction with primer 2 and primer 3 (5\u2032-GTTGTACTGCTAGTGACAGG-3\u2032), an internal primer based on nucleotide sequences of the PCR amplicons. PCR was performed both on the cDNA and on a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA. porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (GenBank accession no. NC_001961) sequences used for alignment were AF304460 (HCoV-229E), AY567487 (HCoV-NL63), DQ648858 (BtCoV 512), AY594268 (BtCoV HKU2), DQ249224 (BtCoV HKU6), DQ249226 (BtCoV HKU7), and DQ249228 (B feces of 1 (33%) of 3 big brown bats sampled at site 2 in north-central Colorado. positive samples from the occult myotis (bat samples 3, 6, 11, 27, and 48) were from sites 1 and 4 in southwestern Colorado, 480 km from site 2. most of the fecal samples were only positive in the PCRs with cDNA diluted 1:10. a 440-nt region of gene 1b of Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses (RM-Bt-CoVs) compared with group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats (BtCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E and NL63. a total of 79 samples (28 fecal samples, 29 anal swab specimens, and 22 oral swab specimens) were collected from 57 bats five (50%) of 10 fecal samples from occult myotis and 1 (17%) of 6 fecal samples from big brown bats were positive for coronavirus in screening tests. the 1 coronavirus-positive sample from big brown bat was from feces of 1 (33%) of 3 big brown bats sampled at site 2 in north-central Colorado. the 1 specimen from the big brown bat (sample 65) was a more distantly related group 1 coronavirus (Figure 2). Figure 1. Nucleotide sequence alignment of amplicons from a 440-nt region of gene 1b of Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses compared with group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats (BtCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E. more than 60 different RNA viruses have been isolated from and detected in bats, which play important roles in maintaining and transmitting zoonotic viruses. the need for understanding the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife was highlighted by the observation that SARS-CoVs that caused 4 sporadic human cases of SARS in 2003\u20132004 were more closely related to viruses from palm civets found in 2004. persistent fecal shedding of coronaviruses has also been detected in pigs, cats, dogs, and cattle. mechanisms for persistent fecal shedding of viruses in bats without apparent disease have not yet been determined. no bat of any species occurs in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. rhinolophid bats are not found in the western Hemisphere and are phylogenetically far removed from the big brown bat (37,38). in our small, initial study of coronaviruses in North American bats, samples were restricted in size, location, and variety of bat species. additional bat coronaviruses with complex phylogenetic attributes, biogeographic patterns, and perhaps epizootiologic attributes may be discovered. bats could play a role in future emergence of coronaviruses in humans or other species. elucidation of their host ranges, receptor specificities, and genetic diversity will greatly aid in understanding of their potential for emergence."}
