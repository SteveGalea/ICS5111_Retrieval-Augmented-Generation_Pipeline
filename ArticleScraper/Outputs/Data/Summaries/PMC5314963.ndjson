CDC should work with state and local stakeholders to define and implement national data standards to improve public health departments' access to electronic health records. the next administration should preserve the National Biosurveillance Strategy and release from the White House a plan for its implementation. federal agencies should digitally connect and automate comparisons of data from food, animal, and human health surveillance programs. federal agencies should digitally connect and automate the comparisons of data from the food, animal, and human health surveillance programs that are operated by CDC, FDA, and USDA. the current Zika crisis underscores that new diagnostic technologies are needed. a bottleneck in biosurveillance analysis is lack of good tools and a skilled workforce to support better analysis and visualization of biosurveillance information. eroding financial support for biosurveillance threatens to undermine progress made to date. eroding financial support for biosurveillance threatens to undermine progress."}
