{"summary": "dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries, with approximately 2.5 billion people at risk. the large proportion of asymptomatic and mild dengue infections can lead to underreporting of dengue cases by routine passive surveillance systems. clinical diagnosis alone may lead to misdiagnosis which can lead to serious clinical outcome. a Bayesian network is a graphical representation of probability distribution in which nodes represent random variables and links represent direct probabilistic influence among the variables. a Bayesian network is a graphical representation of probability distribution in which nodes represent random variables and links represent direct probabilistic influence among the variables. results show that the BN models could be useful to assist physicians in dengue diagnosis, particularly in areas where laboratory resources and physician experience are limited. all patients in the cohort study received history taking, physical examination, basic and specific laboratory investigation for common tropical diseases. factors related to dengue infection Clinical signs and symptoms, physical examination including tourniquet test, and basic laboratory results at diagnosis. variables considered for inclusion in the model were selected according to expert opinion, literature review, and univariate analysis of the data. the NS1 rapid test was introduced into the model separately from the other common laboratory results. the diagnostic performance of two final BN models was determined with and without the NS1 rapid test. the current outbreak situation of dengue may influence a physician\u2019s diagnosis. the Cohen-Kappa coefficient was calculated to determine the reliability of diagnosis made by the two experts. in case of inconsistent diagnosis between the two experts, the final decision was made by a third fellow. data was obtained from a cohort study previously approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. all adult subjects provided written informed consent and a parent of any young subjects (15\u201318 years old) provided written informed consent along with the subjects. the use of the secondary data for this particular study was exempted from ethical review by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. clinical and laboratory profiles of dengue patients show a dynamic pattern. duration of fever at enrollment was considered to influence all clinical and laboratory results, including the accuracy of the NS1 rapid test. two fellows in infectious disease were asked to independently review demographic, clinical and basic laboratory profiles of each patient. two sets of patient profiles, one with NS1 rapid test results and another without NS1 test results, were given in random order to the physicians. final decision was made by a third fellow. the majority (84%) of dengue infected cases had single infection (dengue alone), while the other 16% (30 cases) of dengue infected cases had co-infection with other infectious diseases such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, influenza, murine typhus, typhoid. Dengue and leptospirosis and Murine typhus 1 (0.6) Scrub typhus 4 (1.9) Dengue and Hepatitis A 1 (0.6) Enteric fever 2 (0.9) Leptospirosis and Influenza 1 (0.5) Leptospirosis and Influenza 1 (0.5) Leptospirosis and Scrub typhus 1 (0.5) Total 183 Total 214 Bayesian network model for dengue diagnosis. introducing dengue incidence into the model improved the AUC by 0.03 (from 0.89 to 0.92) for the model without NS1 (model 6), and by 0.02 (from 0.92 to 0.94) for the model with NS1 (model 7). BN models 6 and 7 were considered as the final BN models, without and with the NS1 test. the NS1 rapid test result improved the specificity of the physician\u2019s diagnosis to 79%, while the ability to detect dengue cases (sensitivity) reduced to 75%. the overall accuracy of physician\u2019s dengue diagnosis with NS1 rapid test result was 77% and 74% when reviewing the patient\u2019s profile. 73.2 73.5 76.3 73.5 (66.9\u201379.5) (63.7\u201383.7) (62.5\u201384.5) Specificity (%) 79.4 78.8 71.9 66.0 (72.7\u201386.1) (69.0\u201388.4) (65.6\u201378.2) (57.5\u201374.5) PPV (%) 74.0 75.1 68.6 66.0 (63.0\u201385.0) (63.6\u201386.6) (57.6\u201379.6) (58.6\u201373 the majority (84%) of dengue infected cases had single infection (dengue alone), while the other 16% (30 cases) of dengue infected cases had co-infection with other infectious diseases such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, influenza, murine typhus, typhoid. spirosis and Influenza 1 (0.5) Leptospirosis and Scrub typhus 1 (0.5) Total 183 Total 214 Bayesian network model for dengue diagnosis. model that only contained demographic characteristics, including age, underlying diseases, and occupation, provided an AUC value of 0.65 for prediction of dengue infection. model 6 (without NS1) provided an AUC that ranged from 0.62 to 0.96. 10-fold cross-validation provided an AUC that ranged from 0.72 to 0.97 with average AUC of 0.83. the NS1 rapid test result improved the specificity of the physician\u2019s diagnosis to 79%, while the ability to detect dengue cases (sensitivity) reduced to 75% (Table 7). overall accuracy of physician\u2019s dengue diagnosis without NS1 rapid test result. sensitivity of physician diagnosis increased to 76.3%, but that of the model did not change. previous studies have shown that Bayesian networks can represent complex relationships among variables involved in a disease process. BN models can be effectively applied for dengue diagnosis. variables involved in the BN were considered based on WHO recommendations for dengue diagnosis and statistical analysis of the data. clinical symptoms and laboratory results are usually dynamic over the course of illness [32\u201336] the NS1 rapid test (dual test) alone showed 54% sensitivity (ability to correctly detect dengue cases) while 95% specificity (ability to correctly identify non-dengue patients decreased but still maintained an acceptable level. findings suggest that including the NS1 rapid test result could improve the specificity both in the BN model and in physician\u2019s decision. a large proportion of dengue infection among AUFI cases in this study can affect the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict dengue infection when the model suggests positive for dengue. a large proportion of dengue infection among AUFI cases in this study can affect the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict dengue infection when the model suggests positive for dengue (positive predictive value: PPV) the BN diagnostic model developed in this study provides a high quality dengue diagnosis that can be used in low-resource settings with limited access to laboratory confirmation. the definitive diagnosis of acute febrile illness could permit administration of targeted treatment and withholding of empiric treatment."}
