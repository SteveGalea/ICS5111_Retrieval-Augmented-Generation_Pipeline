{"summary": "a lack of analytic linkage in the literature might not be solely related to technological barriers. the problem might be from a lack of understanding by researchers of the importance of animal data as a'sentinel' work by Halliday and others has focused on establishing a framework to facilitate surveillance efforts. examples of sentinels include the emergence of zoonotic diseases in wildlife populations concurrent with a novel outbreak of disease in humans. this includes the worldwide surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza. there is a belief that automated systems to integrate public health data can enhance the surveillance process. the design and development of these systems requires experts in public health informatics, which is the study of the acquisition, storage, and management of electronic public health data for identifying and controlling health issues. the canary database is a publicly accessible online database of studies in the biomedical literature concerned with animals as sentinels of zoonotic, environmental, and toxic effects on human health. the canary database is a publicly accessible online database of studies in the biomedical literature concerned with animals as sentinels of zoonotic, environmental, and toxic effects on humans. studies that use cases of WNV found in dead crows to quantify the risk of the disease in humans would fall under this category. a seroprevalence study that lists the number of positive Hantavirus cases in both rodents and humans would fall under this category. results At the time of this study, Canary contained 1,661 articles from 1966 to 2007. of these, 465 (28%) were judged to be appropriate original epidemiological investigations that related animal disease data to human disease data. this often includes the trapping of suspected animal reservoirs located in vicinity of confirmed or suspected human cases. Niklasson [42] Puumala Wildlife Cross-correlation function to determine dependence between rodent density and human cases. west Nile Virus Wildlife Number of dead crow sightings per square mile plotted against number of human cases. chi-square, Fisher's, and logistic regression wall analyzed risk factors with infection. exposure to parturient cats and slaughtering of animals assessed through logistic regression wall. chi-square, Fisher's, and logistic regression wall. spotted fever Companion Association between disease infection in canines and risk of disease in humans by performing second order neighborhood analysis on distance of dog residences from known human cases Mannelli [37] Lyme Disease Companion Risk for human exposure of disease vectors was calculated by relative risk using questionnaire data including past exposure to ticks and occupation Li. authors combined animal specimen data with farmer interview data in a logistic regression model. authors used data from the ArboNet system such as number of virus-positive birds, mosquitoes and humans. they evaluated models predictive ability by assessing the coefficient of determination (R2) [15] the authors used a Poisson distribution model to detect clusters of west Nile. they found that mosquito and vegetation data might provide early evidence of human WNV risk. the authors concluded that human risk is \"negatively related to the distance from the vector epicenter\" authors performed a house-to-house survey and performed laboratory analysis on all household members, dogs, and Triatoma infestans. they determined that a causal association existed between the presence of infected dogs and infected insects. authors used cross-correlation function to identify leading indicators of disease outbreaks. a paper by dubey et al [30] studying risk of toxoplasmosis collected interview data from farmers and collected blood and fecal specimens from animals and farmers. many also used additional input variables such as interview and survey data to identify the most parsimonious model. authors combined the various animal specimen data with farmer interview data in a logistic regression model. the authors studied vegetation index data as a means to identify clusters of events such as animal deaths or infected cases of humans or animals. the authors obtained human case information for new york city in 1999. the authors found that mosquito and vegetation data might provide early evidence of human WNV risk. authors used analytic linkage of human and animal data. they used risk ratios such as relative risk and odds ratios. the ratios are often used in active surveillance studies where the number of observations and variables collected is relatively small. the authors used national incidence data from 1985\u20131992 and trapping of voles [42] in this Swedish epidemiological study. the authors used national incidence data from 1985\u20131992 and trapping of voles [42]. the authors used national incidence data from 1985\u20131992. enario 3 is short or long-term seroprevalence surveys, typically of wildlife animals, to estimate the degree of infection of a specific zoonotic disease in animals. these surveys can be initiated by governmental agencies or also the result of independent research by university scientists. Scenario 4 is similar to scenario 2 but is initiated by the discovery of unusual animal deaths, not human deaths. the author does note that recent collaborations by the world health organization might signal a change in the right direction. the reliance on descriptive linkage puts a burden on public health users. the reliance on descriptive linkage puts a burden on public health users. the lack of integrated informatics systems at animal and human agencies makes it difficult to integrate animal and human data and conduct quantitative linkage. this will provide more scientific merit that animal data can be used as sentinels for predicting human risk, and hopefully promote the need for public health informatics surveillance systems to automatically integrate the data. researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the value of animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk. the study highlighted that lack of animal-sentinel approaches in epidemiology and listed methods from the literature for performing these types of linkages. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors. it does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Library of Medicine or the National Institutes of Health."}
