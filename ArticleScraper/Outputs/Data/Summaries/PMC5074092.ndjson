{"summary": "the abstracts are published at the 2014 Infection Prevention 2014 Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. each abstract undergoes a blinded peer review process and is assigned a score. a small proportion of those abstracts have been selected as oral presentations, the remainder as posters. 43 peri-anal C. difficile positive patients were found to be toxigenic. this includes all elective and emergency admissions in all adult specialties. four out of 43 positive samples were found to be toxigenic. four weeks screening from first exposure should be considered the minimum necessary. three months screening would detect primary contacts requiring longer to convert. screening should continue for a sufficient time period after the last known patient is discharged. 20% of suspected cases are the stroke unit, renal unit, private patient unit, hepatobiliary and transplant wards. the gold standard approach indicated that all patients who were high risk should be screened and isolated. on balance, patient safety considerations indicate the need for a pragmatic approach, which is to predominantly screen and isolate only the patients in the highest risk categories. a total of 341 cases were reported over this 73 month period. the best estimate corresponds to early February 2013 (95% confidence interval, CI: August 2012\u2014June 2013), when the bundle was implemented. the peak incidence was 9.2 cases per month (95% CI: 6.0\u201413.2) in March 2013. the SSI rate for April to September 2013 dropped to 6.7% (95% CI 3.3 \u2013 10.1 p= 0.37) against a national average of 5.3%. compliance with hand hygiene and personal protective use increased. a targeted intervention of a specific sticker on the drug chart for antimicrobial prescribing was introduced and trialled on two wards. for example post-intervention, 76% of prescriptions stated a stop date for antimicrobials. it is therefore recommended that the sticker be rolled out onto other wards. patient isolation priorities were as follows: airborne (e.g. measles) > droplet (e.g. respiratory virus) > contact (e.g. MRSA, rotavirus) the percentage of \u2018missed isolations\u2019 was calculated for each pathogen. the proportion of cases attributed to E. coli was higher in 2011 (12.1%) than in 2005/6 (3.1%). this pilot study aimed at measuring the burden of disease and identifying ways to describe the epidemiology and primary causes of E. coli bacteraemia. a pulsed xenon UV room disinfection device (PX-UV) was used in a centre for clinical haematology, which is at high risk for VRE. ten rooms were sampled with contact plates and eight additional rooms sampled with sponge recovery. atul Kotwal1, Harpreet Singh2, Shishir Jain2, R K Joshi2, Rajiv Mohan Gupta2, A K Verma2, S Sinha2, Richa Ranjan2. a multi-centre cross sectional survey amongst 4175 healthy young adults was carried out in training centres. the distribution of HAV, HEV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HCV was 10.22%, 21.87%, 16.98% and 3.74% respectively. the large proportion being susceptible to HEV points towards the requirement of preventive strategies in the form of safe drinking water supply and sanitation. results Patients treated with AOP experienced greater reductions in ulcer pain after treatment compared with placebo treatment. average pain (6.0 vs. 3.5), odour (5.0 vs. 0), impact on sleep (4.3 vs. 0.8) and impact on social activities (5.8 vs. 3.3) were all reduced (composite quality of life average 5.2 vs. 1.9, p=0.001). multiple choice data was analysed in SPSS. results Eighty responses were received. a dominant justification for non-compliance was the lack of hand hygiene among visitors and family members. 'duty of care' for patients was absent there was a strong duty of care to ones-self about when hand hygiene was a benefit to their own health regardless of patient load or environmental challenges. a total of 1888 peri-anal samples were tested and 43 (2.3%) were found to be C. difficile positive. this includes all elective and emergency admissions in all adult specialties. four out of the 43 positive samples turned out to be toxigenic. 2.3%) were found to be C. difficile positive. this includes all elective and emergency admissions in all adult specialties. four out of 43 positive samples were found to be toxigenic. to detect CPE transmission, four weeks screening from first exposure should be considered the minimum necessary. three months screening would detect primary contacts requiring longer to convert and potentially would cover two standard incubation periods, so uncovering secondary contacts. screening should continue for a sufficient time period after the last known patient is discharged. there is debate about admission screening for carbapenemase-producing organisms. the trust became a pilot site for the proposed national public health England (PHE) CPO Toolkit. the case definition was designed for clarity and generalizability. a point prevalence survey was undertaken across all Trust wards. all inpatients were asked if they had healthcare abroad or in a UK hospital in the past 12 months, or contact with a CPO. the case definition was designed for clarity and generalizability. despite implementing targeted active surveillance in 2006, prevalence of VRE continued to rise. further interventions were introduced in late-2012 / early-2013. monthly cases of VRE infection and colonization from January 2008 to January 2014 were extracted from hospital records. a \u2018breakpoint\u2019 regression model was fitted to the monthly number of VRE cases. the best estimate for the breakpoint corresponds to early February 2013 (95% confidence interval, CI: August 2012\u2014June 2013), when the bundle was implemented. Methods and Measurement Infection Control (IC) practices come as a \u2018bundle\u2019 so it can be difficult to isolate the actual cause and effect of any one intervention. the IC team focused on standards stated in the NICE SSI Guideline that included hand hygiene and personal protective equipment practices across the unit.

SURF members work alongside research teams to provide lay input into research priorities, design data collection tools, comment on funding applications and in some cases become co-applicants. RF members work alongside research teams to provide lay input into research priorities, design data collection tools, comment on funding applications, and in some cases become co-applicants. the HCAI Research Network investigated how PPI is integrated into HCAI and AMR research; the challenges and benefits perceived by researchers. a local trained researcher facilitated all discussions. tape recordings were transcribed verbatim and then translated into English. results Expressed frustration with high workload, limited access to hand hygiene solutions, and hand hygiene guidelines being too difficult to recall were accepted as bona fide reasons for non-compliance. no participants acknowledged or expressed hand hygiene as being a \u2018duty of care\u2019 to their patients. a dominant justification for non-compliance was the lack of hand hygiene among visitors and family members. 'duty of care' for patients was absent there was a strong duty of care to ones-self about when hand hygiene was a benefit to their own health. imipenem/meropenem-resistant E. cloacae isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem and meropenem with MICs 2 mg/L. doripenem may serve as alternative choice to treat such infections. flomoxef, a cephamycin with activity against ESBL-producing organisms, can be substituted for carbapenems to treat acute pyelonephritis. patients with APN caused by ESBL-producing organisms and treated with flomoxef were enrolled as cases. treatment success was defined as fever and other systemic signs or symptoms gradually subsided within three days of antibiotic administration. the ESBL-producing strains accounted for 7.5 % (31 of 381), 8.3% (33 of 363), 8.2% (34 of 381), 15.9% (68 of 360) and 18.8 % (81 of 351) of E. coli isolates in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. the incidence of ESBL-producing strains in E. coli isolated from blood in this hospital during the five-year period. the influence of antimicrobial prescribing behaviour in nurse prescribers is concerning and should be observed closely. research suggests inappropriate prescribing is apparent in practice. high consumption, increased frequency and imprudent use are believed to accelerate resistance. a method which allows for a more thorough exploration of all influencing factors on prescribing behaviour may be useful to inform future behavioural strategies designed to be inclusive and relevant to this ever increasing group of prescribers. the trend of pulmonary disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) seems to be increasing globally. of the 510 NTM isolates, the first five were Mycobacterium intracellulare (n = 197, 38.6%), Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 113, 22.2%), Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 107, 21%), Mycobacterium gordonae (n = 45, 8.8%), and Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 31, 6.1%). patients were educated about self-care of their catheter, when to seek help or advice, and given a leaflet for reference. this allowed the nurse to assess patients within the manufacturers\u2019 licence, considering contingencies, and allowed action if the patient was found to be symptomatic of a systemic catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection Evidence of Improvement Feedback from staff for the pathway has been positive. imipenem/meropenem-resistant E. cloacae isolates were susceptible to doripenem. doripenem may serve as an alternative choice to treat such infections. patients with lonephritis (APN) caused by ESBL-producing organisms were enrolled as cases. patients with similar infections but treated with doripenem were enrolled as controls for comparison. treatment success was defined as fever and other systemic signs or symptoms gradually subsided within three days of antibiotic administration. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms are increasing worldwide. from 2009 to 2013, all E. coli isolates obtained from blood cultures were enrolled in this study. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 7.5 % (31 of 381), 8.3% (33 of 363), 8.2% (34 of 381), 15.9% (68 of 360) and 18.8 % (81 of 351) of E. coli isolates in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2011, 2012 a systematic review of antimicrobial prescribing behaviour in nurse prescribers: a systematic review Valerie Ness1, Lesley Price1, Kay Currie1, Jacqui Reilly1,2 1Glasgow Caledonian University, 2Health Protection Scotland Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an urgent public health concern and threatens to reduce the effectiveness of antimicrobials. biochip can distinguish 15 of the most common species of NTM in Taiwan with an accuracy rate of >99% among all NTM-positive species. biochip can further distinguish 15 of the most common species of NTM in Taiwan with an accuracy rate of >99%. the application of biochip can quickly identify NTM but also distinguish different species. biochip may help physicians to prescribe the optimal antibiotics for treating infections caused by NTM. a collaborative approach to urine specimens has proven successful. education and guidance will be extended to domiciliary services, and care homes. cloacae isolates were susceptible to doripenem, indicating that doripenem may serve as an alternative choice to treat such infections. 93.7% (15 of 16) may be sufficiently treated with doripenem. imipenem/meropenem-resistant E. cloacae isolates were susceptible to doripenem, indicating that doripenem may serve as an alternative choice to treat such infections. 93.7% (15 of 16) may be sufficiently treated with doripenem. treatment success was defined as fever and other systemic signs or symptoms gradually subsided within three days of antibiotic administration. the remaining 4 were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. the rates of treatment success were not statistically significant between the two groups. treatment success was defined as fever and other systemic signs or symptoms gradually subsided within three days of antibiotic administration. treatment success was found in 18 of the 20 cases with flomoxef therapy; the remaining 4 were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. from 2009 to 2013, all E. coli isolates obtained from blood cultures were enrolled in this study. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 7.5 % (31 of 381), 8.3% (33 of 363), 8.2% (34 of 381), 15.9% (68 of 360) and 18.8 % (81 of 351) of E. coli isolates in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2011, 2012. from 2009 to 2013, all E. coli isolates obtained from blood cultures were enrolled in this study.

NUH introduced hydrogen peroxide vapour technology to decontaminate each room following the discharge of a patient known to be infected or colonised with a MDRO. each Q10 is used on average once per day (1.0 \u2013 1.3) each Q10 is used on average once per day (1.0 \u2013 1.3). usage has been extended to include other inpatient areas experiencing increases in MDRO acquisitions or for outbreak control. future steps HPV service has become integrated into hospital operations. we plan to further optimize the service by extending services to be available 24hours/7days per week. a small number of articles identified detailing surgical instrument decontamination failures underlines the low risk of cross-infection. the diverse nature of reported surgical instrument incidents also suggests that failures are not systemic. however, the possibility of reluctance to publish failures must be considered. laboratory by neutralisation and then for C. difficile viability. results 5.6x105 cfu were recovered from the control with no exposure to the disinfectant. 1.4x101 cfu were recovered at the 10 test locations. new process reduces wash temperature by 40oC and saves 22 minutes (34%) of time and 111 litres of water (40%) per wash cycle. commercial laundry has adopted the new laundry wash system where it has been successfully used for 18 months. the adjusted tools were then used in six NHS Scotland Health Boards to measure time taken to clean in a variety of contexts. the checklist and measurement tools were well received and considered self-explanatory by those undertaking the study. ATP scores demonstrate medical device cleanliness was on average 50% cleaner when using the new cleaner/disinfector compared to the standard process. the new process eliminated the use of paper towels. this significantly reduced waste produced when cleaning devices. the total CFU in the post clean group was 5959 while in the post PX-UV group, the total CFU was 1089. this led to a mean CFU of 79.4 and 14.5 for the post clean and post PX-UV groups respectively, representing an 81.7% reduction p0.0001. patient admission and attendance in 2013/14 of 632 and 109,375 in ICCU and ED respectively required the multi-disciplinary team to value the longer-term benefit of admitting patients to a decontaminated environment. a reduction in cases of C. difficile has been observed since HPV room decontamination occurred. aeruginosa infections in large area burn patients may be from hands of medical staff, object surface in laminar flow clean room, and door knobs and keyboards. the positive rate of the samples from object surface in treatment room was 12.5%. the major causes of infection are not generally due to personal contact between medical process and patients, but are usually due to more broad environmental causes. it is advisable that nurses take more notice of environmental conditions rather than delegating this to non-medical staff. the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cleaning between cases. UV light method has been successful in improving the degree of cleaning in our operating theatres. this is as a direct result of team discussions, knowledge of location of the gel, training as well as improvements in cleaning technique. a questionnaire was distributed for user-feedback. results PAA;1000ppm demonstrated >6log median (99.9999%) reductions of CD within 15min (without soiling) but within 30sec (with SF) using PAA:4000ppm. 9 of the remaining 116 HTOs not effectively cleaned were shared equipment for multi-patient use, e.g. hoist. the equipment is required to be thoroughly cleaned after patient use and is the responsibility of nursing staff. Percentage improvement Patient Room 39% ICU Daily & Discharge cleaning 37% Rapid Response team 40% Operating Theatre 64% Visual auditing scores, already very high, saw a 1-2% improvement with the Encompass interventions. antimicrobial activity of Eucalyptus globulus was superior to chlorhexidine when applied to the microorganism. the 10% papain showed an antimicrobial effect inferior to that of chlorhexidine when applied to Candida albicans. the inhibitory activity of Eucalyptus globulus was superior to that of chlorhexidine when applied to the microorganism. the substances, 10% xylitol and 20% xylitol, showed no inhibition of the tested microorganisms. results We analysed 16 controlled experimental studies, one of which was randomized, one cross-over and two were before and after comparison. hypochlorite showed higher antimicrobial efficacy, including spores, and broad antimicrobial activity. the search was performed from December 2013 to February 2014 using COCHRANE, LILACS, PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCIELO, CINHAL databases. results We analysed 16 controlled experimental studies, one of which was randomized, one cross-over and two were before and after comparisons. NUH introduced hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) technology to decontaminate each room following the discharge of a patient known or suspected of being infected or colonised with a MDRO. the pilot trial demonstrated operational feasibility. since then, 1733 deployments using five Q10 suites have been completed. each Q10 is used on average once per day (1.0 \u2013 1.3) NUH introduced hydrogen peroxide

commercial laundry compared standard laundry process (75oC) with a new system combining a specialist detergent with a non-corrosive, high level disinfectant rinse at 35oC. primary outcome was mattress cleanliness. commercial laundry has adopted the new laundry wash system. the laundry process itself and replacing damaged or worn mattress covers represent significant costs for mattress providers, Trusts, loan stores etc. managing fleets of specialist air mattresses. the improvement issue was to identify a more energy efficient laundry process which could deliver equivalent or improved mattress cleanliness without exposure to excessive heat or corrosive chemicals. we sought to establish a protected timeframe for nurses/cleaning staff to complete bedspace discharge cleaning before the following patient can be admitted. this time is applicable for different ward-types (e.g. ICU, psychiatry etc.) and bedspace-types (e.g. single room, four-bed bay etc.) a methodology was developed and a study undertaken to establish how long such cleaning takes and if this time differs within and between specialties. the checklist and measurement tool were assessed according to their usefulness and usability by staff responsible for hospital cleaning. the adjusted tools were then used in six NHS Scotland Health Boards to measure time taken to clean. medical device cleanliness was determined using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swab testing of ten devices before and after standard (detergent-based) cleaning. process efficiency was assessed by performing formal time-and-motion assessments when processing ten devices with both the standard and the new cleaning process. medical device cleanliness was determined using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swab testing of ten devices before and after standard (detergent-based) cleaning and when using the new cleaner/disinfector. time-and-motion studies demonstrated clear improvements with a >50% efficiency saving when using the new product. the number of surfaces with no growth (CFU=0) after sampling in the post-cleaning group was 3 (4.0%) while in the post PX-UV group the number of no growth surfaces was 31 (41.3%) the number of surfaces with less than 5 CFU were 17 (22.6%) and 52 (69.3%) for the post clean and post PX-UV groups respectively. contact plates were taken from sites after terminal cleaning (post clean) the area was treated with PX-UV and repeat samples taken from adjacent areas at the same site. one operating theatre was also sampled. total aerobic colony counts were performed after 48 hours incubation. despite the application of the HPV process in numerous clinical areas across the Trust, it had never been undertaken in areas such as emergency department (ED) and the 30 bedded Integrated Critical Care Unit (ICCU) both departments are very busy and have large expansive areas which makes deployment of HPV very difficult. patient admission and attendance in 2013/14 of 632 and 109,375 in ICCU and ED respectively required the multi-disciplinary team to value the longer-term benefit of admitting patients to a decontaminated environment. a reduction in cases of C. difficile has been observed since HPV room decontamination occurred. the positive rate of the samples from burn wounds was 18.7%. the positive rate of the samples from object surface in laminar flow clean room was 10.4%. the positive rate of the samples from hands of medical staff was 12.5%. the positive rate of the samples from hand of medical staff was 12.5%. interviews with four infection control nurses at four hospitals in Hyogo prefecture of Japan. each hospital has 100 beds. interviews were carried out for 30 minutes using a semi-structured data collection process. interviews with four infection control nurses at four hospitals in Hyogo prefecture of japan. each hospital has 100 beds. interviews were carried out for 30 minutes using a semi-structured data collection process. phase 1 was a blind approach to create a baseline. results were shared with the team following 12 cardiac surgery cases. phase 2 was to assess whether discussions were successful in improving standards of cleanliness. phase 1: Of the 216 high touch objects that were gelled, 60 passed (28%) with a median of 3.5 per object and a mean of 6 per object. phase 2: Of the 216 high touch objects tested, 129 passed (60%) with a median of 7 per object and a mean of 6 per object. phase 2 shows an increase in the pass rate of 32% in just one month of repeat testing where 3/18 passed 100% of the time and 0/18 failed. DW was wiped-clean using a microfiber cloth (225cm2) wetted with PAA (1000ppm), NaDCC (1000ppm) or tap water (control) and sampled after thirty or sixty minutes. a questionnaire was distributed for user-feedback. tic acid (PAA) disinfectant (Peracide) was assessed against CD (027 spores) in distilled water (DW) or synthetic faecal (SF) soiling. a polypropylene surface (25cm2) contaminated with 106cfu spores (no soiling; DW) was wiped-clean using a microfiber cloth (225cm2) wetted with PAA (1000ppm), NaDCC (1000ppm the IPC team measured the effectiveness of cleaning across 39 different high touch objects (HTOs) during a 24 hour period. an HTO was deemed to be thoroughly cleaned if all the DAZO Gel\u00ae was removed. staff should undertake regular visual assessment. implement the EnCompass Hygiene Intelligence program across the hospital to gain assurance of cleaning effectiveness and cleaning standards. ally improving cleaning standards and performance in a large NHS Acute Trust Gary Thirkell Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust Improvement Issue and Context The role environmental cleaning plays in the prevention of transmission of healthcare acquired infections is consistently recognised. the Trust implemented EnCompass Hygiene Intelligence program to improve cleaning performance across 2 large hospitals. the Trust implemented an EnCompass Hygiene Intelligence program to improve cleaning performance across 2 large hospitals within Patient Wards, Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Theatres. a continuous improvement program was implemented including: Strong communications program, Weekly feedback, 1:1 feedback, Targeted education based on analysis from monitoring. doctors have different practices in adherence to infection control (IC) standards depending on their undergraduate training and possibly experience. a multi-centre, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in October-November 2013 using a self-administered questionnaire. national blood transfusion service/ Health Protection Scotland 2Scottish national blood transfusion service Improvement Issue and Context. increased use of alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) led to increased number of reportable skin irritation incidents from donor services staff. only 37.6% of the 5000 clinical staff attended an IC update in the previous year. the update was delivered face to face at a study day using a power-point presentation. an online/ paper workbook was developed. e-Bug educates young people about microbiology, hygiene and the spread, treatment and prevention of infection. the e-Bug resources comprise of educational packs for teachers and an interactive website. IPS (Scottish Branch) offered a leadership training programme for 10 IPCPs. they agreed the 5 success criteria at the start of the course and an evaluation questionnaire was completed. participants described the course as 'hungry to learn' and there was a high level of engagement. of July 2013, 1808 nurses are registered certified nurses in infection control (CNICs) through japan. the goal of career development and a systematic educational program for CNICs have not been developed in Japan. the certification nurse in infection control (CNIC) was established in 2000. the health care reform Act 2012 grants an assessment to hospitals that employ an infection control nurse. the number of full-time infection preventionists increased from 61% to 72% by the introduction of the Health Care Reform Act 2012. the 5 moments for hand hygiene provides guidance on when hand hygiene should be performed. compliance with the 5 moments is lowest for the 5th moment. the 5th moment was implemented by the trust arts for health co-ordinator, Patient information lead and a children\u2019s author. the team provided a children\u2019s author with information and descriptions of commonly occurring pathogens in a Paediatric Hospital. the organisms chosen were RSV, Influenza, Rotavirus, Norovirus, MRSA, Chickenpox and ESBL. the importance of hand hygiene to prevent the spread of infection has long been established. the world health organisation (WHO) identifies 5 key moments when hand hygiene is required. doctors have different practices in adherence to infection control (IC) standards depending on their undergraduate training and possibly experience. this study aims to explore the IC training needs of this very important subgroup of healthcare workers. doctors have different practices in adherence to infection control (IC) standards depending on their undergraduate training and possibly experience. it is expected that this study will identify the IC training needs of this very important subgroup of healthcare workers. of the \u2018wHO five moments for hand hygiene\u2019 in 2007, increased use of alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) led to an increase in the number of reportable skin irritation incidents from donor services staff. complex multi processes involved in taking a blood donation meant that healthcare workers were performing hand hygiene up to ten times per donation, nursing approximately 30 donors per session. HCWs performed hand hygiene up to ten times per donation, nursing approximately 30 donors per session. hand hygiene is primarily important to prevent contamination of the blood products collected. the workbook met the IC competencies defined by Skills for Health for all staff having direct patient contact. follows implementation of the workbook in august 2013, subsequent quarterly reports were reviewed. evidence of improvement Prior to implementation 37.6% had completed their update in the previous year. following implementation 44.4% had completed an update representing a statistically significant increase (p= 0.0001). 13% of the staff had completed an update utilising the new workbook. qualitative focus groups and interviews are being conducted with school nurses, school nurse assistants, teachers, and other stakeholders. evidence of improvement Preliminary data identifies that e-Bug should be targeted at various informal educators, and in some regions school nurses. research is underway in Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Shropshire and London. e-Bug should be targeted at various informal educators, and in some regions school nurses. findings come at a time when the department of health\u2019s UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy identifies a key area for future action as improving professional education, training and public engagement. reflective practice is an important learning opportunity. IPCPs comments included that the course \u201ctaught me not to pre-judge and to be more open-minded\u201d and to focus on \u201cpositive reflection\u201d Impact of the service is important and IPCPs described how other members in their team could see the benefits. IPCPs described the participants as 'hungry to learn' and there was a high level of engagement. future developments are to build in a workshop 6 months after the end of the programme. the percentages of scoring mean of each core component were from 44% to 48.9%. the percentages of four other components, which were \u201cfuture-oriented domains\u201d, were from 39.3% to 46.6%. 201 competent (20.7%), 110 proficient (11.4%), and 10 experts (1.0%). percentages of scoring mean of each core component were from 44% to 48.9%. the number of full-time infection preventionists increased from 61% to 72% by the introduction of the Health Care Reform Act 2012. the role of ICNJ and its responsibility should be to support IPs so that they can fully serve patients with specialized knowledge and skills on a daily basis. the health care reform Act has been helping achieve full deployment of full-time IPs in all medical institutions. the role of ICNJ and its responsibility should be to support IPs so that they can fully serve patients with specialized knowledge and skills on daily basis. compliance varied with Health Board (23 (2)=10.3,1p=0.006) but not professional group (23=5.3,1p=0.2). participants were less positive about the repetitive nature of the 5th moment. there was a positive relationship between compliance and the perception that the 5th moment was widely known. participants were less positive about the repetitive nature of the 5th moment. 60% indicating that it was repetitive. lack of understanding of guidelines regarding the implementation of the 5th moment may be contributing to staffs\u2019 perception that it is repetitive. children were involved in all stages of the process from making the puppets to filming. the infection Prevention Team achieved Investors in Children Status for their involvement in the project. the world health organisation (WHO) identifies 5 key moments when hand hygiene is required. the IPCT wrote lyrics, set to the tune of \u201cMagic Moments\u201d and a storyboard for an accompanying video was designed. Future Steps Once the video is completed, it will be uploaded to the Trust website and social media accounts. the importance of hand hygiene to prevent the spread of infection has long been established. the world health organisation (WHO) identified 5 key moments when hand hygiene is required. there have been 12 Scottish isolates of this rare organism since 2007. the occurrence of three community infections in a small geographical area is of public health significance. a new form was adapted from the existing PHE acute questionnaire. the most common primary foci of infection were urinary tract (44%), unknown sources of infection (26%), and hepatobiliary system (13%), these proportion were significantly different (p0.05) from those in the rest of England. the clinically assigned likelihood that an episode represents a \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cpossible\u201d HCAI was 27%. a strain of K. ascorbata was isolated from bile of one patient with acute cholecystitis on 17 March 2014. a strain of K. ascorbata was isolated from bile of another patient with urinary tract infection on 17 April 2014 at the same intensive care unit. this was a pseudo outbreak of K. ascorbata infections. 82 organisms from 73 CLABSI cases and 35 organisms from 35 CRBSI cases were collected and analyzed. the PPV for CRBSI varied with different causative organisms from 8.3% (Enterobactericeae) to 82.4 % (S. aureus) if the causative organisms of CLABSI cases are other organisms, the diagnosis of CRBSI should be highly suspected. if the causative organisms are other organisms, CRBSI are less likely; hence, further laboratory studies may be necessary to diagnose CRBSI. the first time NHS24 calls data has been used as an adjunct to the HPS prevalence data. this confirmed a local community norovirus issue. additional work is needed to explore the utility of NHS24 calls in reducing the incidence and impact of norovirus. the detectable rate of TBC was 5.8 % (n = 396), 5.8 % (n = 394), and 3.9% (n = 269) by using Biochip, TCM, and AFS. the accurate rate of identifying TBC by AFS was 58.5% (269 of 460) an advanced nurse practitioner was appointed to conduct prospective SSI surveillance and monitor compliance with SSI prevention policies and guidelines. all suspected deep incisional or organ/space infections are discussed at multi-disciplinary team meetings to conduct root cause analysis and agree infection classification according to Public Health England definitions. data are collected prospectively on eligible patients from the time of surgery to discharge, death or 10 days for caesarean section post operatively. a telephone questionnaire on PDS methods was conducted by HPS with a surveillance coordinator from each of the boards. the majority of NHS boards continue to perform local SSI surveillance using paper forms. the effective reproductive number for MRSA was 0.37 without compliance to hand hygiene and 0.12 without compliance to contact precaution. the impact of infection control interventions reduced the prevalence from a predicted 17% to an observed 13%. the trust best practice guidance recommends accurate documentation of the care of VAD and UC. the documentation of all indwelling devices and wound care is now reviewed during the senior nurse rounds. information from the tool, including the total number of patients and staff infected, the number of wards affected and the total lost bed days, is disseminated to key staff in the Trust. the tool will link it to the Microsoft Access database used by the Infection Prevention Team to record routine clinical activity. the 70 mm diameter sampling cyclone is predicted to have the potential to collect 99% of this particle size range. the cyclone is also predicted to collect with 100% efficiency particles of 4 microns. the cyclone is also predicted to collect with 100% efficiency particles of 4 microns. multidrug resistant organisms such as ESBL producers and CPE led to outbreaks in high risk areas. exposure to childhood illnesses such as chickenpox and Measles led to nosocomial infection in unvaccinated children. nationally set targets fail to address frequent causes of HCAI in a Paediatric Trust. the outbreak was declared over when no more cases had been identified for 1 month. the capacity of the unit was reduced to 9 cots including 5 single rooms. there have been no further cases of the outbreak strain identified. the average length of stay of patients prior to the development of the CDI was 21,2 days. the vast majority (71.9%) of the episodes were of nosocomial origin. almost all the patients (98.5%) were using antibiotics prior to the development of the CDI. during 2009-2013, following the 2008 CDC criteria, the medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. we analyzed epidemiological and microbiological data. oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has increased difficulty in treatment. contact precautions only are implemented as the infection control measure to decrease the incidence of ORSA. pneumoniae was detected between 10/19/2013 and 11/4/2013 in three patients admitted to general and digestive surgery unit, who coincided in time and space. infection surveillance, control and educational programs for healthcare workers were conducted by the Infection Control Team. no clinical samples No rectal swabs October 2013 1 0 November 2013 4 6 December 2013 4 10 January 2014 5 5 February 2014 5 6 March 2014 2 4 April 2014 2 4 May 2014 0 5 All of.pneumoniae were CTXM-15 producers. results Of the 478 women who underwent delivery by C-section during the period of observation, follow-up data was obtained for 284 (59%) 71 ladies contacted were deemed to have experienced a SSI, representing 15% of the cohort studied. IRHA was present in 12.5% of the cases, mostly males (57.5%) with mean age of 54.2617.29. LOS and SAPS 2 prognostic score were independent related to IRHA. -beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) Escherichia coli in the community between august and November 2013. there have been 12 Scottish isolates of this organism since 2007. the occurrence of three community infections in a small geographical area is of public health significance. isolated isolates belong to a cluster of NDM producers from diverse geographical locations, suggesting that it represents a successful international lineage. epidemiological investigation revealed links between cases: locum doctor; out-of-Hours care; and a local dental surgery. the most common primary foci of infection were urinary tract (44%), unknown sources of infection (26%), and hepatobiliary system (13%) the clinically assigned likelihood that an episode represents a \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cpossible\u201d HCAI was 27%. we described and compared the epidemiology of E.coli bacteraemia in the west Midlands against that of the rest of England during 2012-2013. the cumulative incidence was 126 per 100,000 population (95%CI 123,129) and 123 per 100,000 (95%CI 122, 124) in England. the most common primary foci of infection were urinary tract (44%), unknown sources of infection (26%), these proportion were significantly different (p0.05) from those in the rest of England. in a regional hospital in southern Taiwan, a strain of K. ascorbata was isolated from bile of one patient with acute cholecystitis on 17 March 2014. thereafter, another strain of K. ascorbata was isolated from urine of another patient with urinary tract infection on 17 April 2014 at the same intensive care unit. this study was conducted to investigate whether outbreak of K. ascorbata infections had occurred. two isolates were considered as the same strains if they had three or less band differences. PFGE patterns revealed that the two isolates of K. ascorbata had more than four band differences indicating that they were distinct strains. this was a pseudo outbreak of K. ascorbata infections. the PPV for CRBSI was 47.9 % (35 of 73) according to the causative organisms, that was 82.4 % (14 of 17) in S. aureus, 40% (4 of 10) in CoNS, 60 % (6 of 10) in P. aeruginosa, 8.3 % (1 of 12) in Enterobactericeae, 58.3% (7 of 12) in Candida, and 14.3% (3 of 21) of other organisms 82 organisms from 73 CLABSI cases and 35 organisms from 35 CRBSI cases were collected and analyzed. the PPV for CRBSI was 47.9 % (35 of 73) according to the causative organisms, that was 82.4 % (14 of 17) in S. aureus. NHS Borders sought reassurance that hospital norovirus outbreaks were being introduced primarily from the community. results HPS received 300 fewer reports of wards closed in 2013-2014, compared to season 2012-2013. NHS Borders sought reassurance that hospital norovirus outbreaks were being introduced primarily from the community. results HPS received 300 fewer reports of wards closed in 2013-2014 compared to season 2012-2013. TCM is regarded as the golden standard of identifying TBC. but it is a time-consuming method. 6819 samples were enrolled in this study from January to December 2013. biochip should have an important role to identify TBC, resulting in rapid diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. the accurate rate of identifying TBC by AFS was 58.5% (269 of 460) biochip had a higher detectable rate and more accurate rate than AFS (5.8% vs. 3.9% vs. 100 % vs. 58.5% respectively), resulting in rapid diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis and decreasing nosocomial spread. outcomes and a reduction in the rate of deep incisional and organ/space infection have been achieved through a variety of interventions. learning from case review meetings is disseminated to continue to the reduction in the rate of SSI after cardiac surgery. all NHS boards are currently required to undertake surveillance for caesarean section procedures. the proportion of caesarean section SSI detected by PDS to day 10 accounted for 85.5% of all the SSI detected for caesarean section during 2013 within NHSScotland. all NHS boards are currently required to undertake surveillance for caesarean section procedures. the proportion of caesarean section SSI detected by PDS to day 10 accounted for 85.5% of all the SSI detected for caesarean section during 2013 within NHSScotland. Using a micro-epidemiological framework typically applied to vector-borne diseases, we examined the transmission dynamics of MRSA on a medical unit of an acute care hospital in Vancouver, Canada. interventions included: nursing-patient contact, hand hygiene compliance and contact precaution. patients with laboratory confirmed MRSA were identified by an electronic flag in our patient management system. the estimated basic reproductive number for MRSA was 0.37 without compliance to hand hygiene and 0.12 without compliance to contact precaution. the impact of infection control interventions reduced the prevalence from a predicted 17% to an observed 13%. documentation of UC was generally poor. Discussion The predisposing risk factors identified in this cohort of patients were: indwelling VAD, UC and wounds. the trust best practice guidance recommends accurate documentation of the care of VAD and UC. these results have prompted a review of how the medical division ensures this happens. the trust best practice guidance recommends accurate documentation of the care of VAD and UC. the documentation of all indwelling devices and wound care is now reviewed during the senior nurse rounds. it is accessible via a tablet PC, enabling data entry on the ward. information from the tool, including the total number of patients and staff infected, the number of wards affected and the total lost bed days is disseminated to key staff in the Trust. cyclones are powerful tools with which to capture bioaerosol material. cyclone models and computational fluid dynamics are used to determine separation grade efficiency of a 70 mm diameter glass sampling cyclone. sampling cyclones offer the chance to investigate how the risks associated with airborne pathogen distributions work in normal clinical practice. the first aim of this study is to assess the potential of sampling cyclones to collect respirable pathogens from within hospital environments. a prospective study looked at the incidence of alert organisms at a specialist Paediatric Trust. the organisms causing healthcare associated infection (HCAI) in paediatrics can be different to those affecting adult patients. paediatric patients can present unique challenges to an Infection Prevention & Control Team due to their susceptibility to infections prevented in older patients by previous exposure or vaccination. a prospective study looked at the incidence of alert organisms at a specialist Paediatric Trust. 12 babies were identified as having acquired an extended spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli on our 12 cot neonatal surgical unit. eight babies had rectal colonisation and four developed clinical infection. one baby died as a result of E.coli sepsis. 12 babies were identified as having acquired an extended spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. eight babies had rectal colonisation and four developed clinical infection. one baby died as a result of E.coli sepsis. 127 episodes of CDI corresponding to 122 patients were identified. of these, 12 had at least one recurrence within the same episode. prevalence rates of CDI increased from 0,34 to 1,81 cases per 1,000 hospitalised patients from 2009 through 2013. our findings support the psychiatric disorders and their treatment risk factors listed in the literature. the aim of this study was to assess the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for CDI. findings support the psychiatric disorders and their treatment risk factors listed in the literature. findings support the psychiatric disorders and their treatment risk factors listed in the literature. YEAST Intensive care unit 41 (11.45%) 25 (6%) Hemato- oncology ANAEROBICS 8 * 56 were polymicrobial infections. GPC = Gram positive cocci NC Staphylococcus = Coagulase negative staphylococci GPB = Gram positive bacilli NFGNB = Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli Discussion Secondary Bloodstream Infections are an important factor of morbidity. YEAST Intensive care unit 41 (11.45%) 25 (6%) were polymicrobial infections. oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has increased difficulty in treatment. isolates including OSSA (n = 511, 46.4%) and ORSA (n = 590, 53.6%) were enrolled in this study. the incidence of ORSA was about 53.6 % in this hospital, being higher in 2009 (66.9%) and lower in 2011 (43.6%). isolates, including OSSA (n = 511, 46.4%) and ORSA (n = 590, 53.6%), were enrolled. the incidence of ORSA was about 53.6 % in this hospital, being higher in 2009 (66.9%) and lower in 2011 (43.6%) outbreak of OXA-48-producing K.pneumoniae was detected between 10/19/2013 and 11/4/2013 in three patients admitted to general and digestive surgery unit. infection surveillance, control and educational programs for healthcare workers were conducted by the Infection Control Team. outbreak of OXA-48-producing K.pneumoniae was detected between 10/19/2013 and 11/4/2013 in three patients admitted to general and digestive surgery unit. infection surveillance, control and educational programs for healthcare workers were conducted by the Infection Control Team. the Surgical Site Infection Surveillance Service (SSISS) at Public Health England (PHE) conducted a programme of enhanced surveillance of SSI following C-section deliveries. data collection sheets, patient information and discharge letters were devised. study identified that useful data can be obtained once clear guidelines and protocols have been established. significant financial savings can be made due to reduced readmissions and treatment costs. study was done in 9 heterogeneous ICUs belonging to a public hospital in So Paulo, Brazil. data was collected from medical records of patients. IRHA was present in 12.5% of the cases. the number of infectious event was correlated to the LOS (rs = 0.403, p0.000), burden of disease measured by Charlson (rs = 0.075; p0.030), severity measured by SAPS2 (rs = 0.182; p0.000) and by LODS (rs = 0.128; p0.000). LOS and SAPS 2 prognostic score were independent related to the occurrence of IRHA. the occurrence of infection was more prevalent among male (8.4%; p0.030), admitted for clinical treatment (8.1%; p0.004) the number of infectious event was correlated to the LOS (rs = 0.403, p0.000), burden of disease measured by Charlson (rs = 0.075; p0.030), severity measured by SAPS2 (rs = 0.182; p0.000) and by LODS (rs = 0.128; p0.000). 54.9% were females, 77.1% had a bachelor degree or above and 72.6% had nursing experience of 5 years or more. 97.7% indicated that infection control training is needed. the aim of this study was to assess the exposure potential to blood during cannulation through observations of the procedure and in particular of the inner needle. four patients received more than one cannulation when staff wore gloves for part of the procedure. patients who underwent knee or hip replacement surgery were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview during their hospital stay. a purposive, maximum variation sample was used. interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. participants were aged 43-99 years (mean=70 years) the results show that patient satisfaction was greater during outbreaks in 78% of cases. this has generated local discussion in terms of whether a closed ward due to norovirus lends itself to a better nurse to patient ratio. the high incidence of norovirus and challenging C.difficile target meant that there was an urgent need to develop new initiatives and \u201cthink outside the box\u201d the IP&C Specialist Nurses have since implemented a system of timely follow up and assessment working collaboratively with ward staff. small colony variants are atypical organisms, showing unusual phenotypic and virulence characteristics. a single-site collection of gram positive isolates (n=5) was examined for SCV and wild type phenotypes based on cultural and biochemical characteristics. two products were produced: a summary evidence table and a crib card. the evidence table gives details of each outbreak found including the species implicated, the number of patients affected, fatalities, proposed route of transmission and any suspected environmental involvement. playford et al1 controlled heparin-associated-bacteraemias by replacement 24 hourly and after disconnection. no further bacteraemias have occurred. study was conducted with subjects for knowledge and technical competence scored on a five point scale. 102 sophomore\u2019s nursing students were assessed according to how well they understood the use of the personal protective equipment for the purpose of infection control. method We retrospectively analysed the constituent ratio and antibiotic resistance of A.baumannii in the blood specimens of ICU patients during 2012 and 2013 at a large state hospital in Beijing. the hospital detected 360 strains of bacteria from the blood specimens of ICU patients. aimed to examine the scientific evidence on the use of antiseptics on the healing of chronic wounds with biofilm in humans. results Twelve studies, who met the inclusion criteria, were included. the systematic review also examined in vitro studies to form its recommendations. norovirus outbreaks are the commonest cause of healthcare service disruption due to ward closures. one means of reducing the incidence of norovirus is by reducing the flow of people \u2018traffic\u2019 in affected areas. nationally, with inconsistent practice in evidence, this presentation will provide further detail of the analysis of the current nature of TSV practice across NHS Boards and the care home sector in Scotland. these indicators evaluation allowed further recognition of the modus operandi of associated infection control programs in health care. further investigations need to be developed to recognise the impact of the conformity of these programs according to the occurrence of infections in healthcare institutions. a direct observation method has been recommended to evaluate HH compliance among health-care workers. the result of regression analysis examining compliance rate was reasonable as an index to predict the HH compliance rate by the direct observation method (R2 = 0.549, S.E. = 0.061, p = 0.01) this developed index could be used as an alternative method for the direct observation to evaluate HH practice. in excess of 9,000 tottles, indicating excellent user acceptance. IP&C will be installing the water-based product as their hand sanitiser of choice once the new building is complete. a high proportion of patients had ARO screening specimens ordered and collected within 72 hours of admission. early detection of ARO colonization/infection among high-risk patients being admitted to hospital is essential to minimize health care associated ARO transmission. health protection Scotland has developed a national infection prevention and control manual (NIP&CM) to reduce variation and optimise infection prevention and control practices throughout Scotland. experts from a range of disciplines representing every area in NHSScotland agreed pragmatic recommendations on issues with limited evidence. in 2008/2009 the blood culture contamination rate was above the national expectation at 5%. the health care acquired MRSA bacteraemia rate was ten. if a patient has suspected sepsis, the necessary equipment for the procedure was collected separately. there were four cases of glyocpeptide resistant enterococci (GRE) isolated from patients on the intensive care unit. three of the isolates were sent for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. there were no new cases for over 2 months. the implementation of a complete review of practices and decontamination processes reduced the number of cases. the project was to review aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) practice and adapt the ANTT Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) against best practice guidelines. research sought to examine the phenomenon of visiting time. aims to provide a greater understanding of the activity taking place on wards during this period. a TB airborne line list (TB airborne line list) is a tool for optimizing infection control interventions for patients with suspected TB. it is a consistent and systematic approach to identify and follow patients with suspected TB based on acid fast bacilli orders. HCAIs adhering to evidenced based standard precautions guidelines (SPGs) non-compliance with SPGs can negatively impact on paediatric patients by increasing their hospital stay, exposing them to the complications of infections. hospitals must have services to prevent and control healthcare-associated infections. but regional and economic differences often define the gap between social reality and law. hospitals were general hospitals (82%); had 51-150 beds (64%); had ICU (70%); obstetric specialty (76%); operating room, medical and surgical clinics (100%). SSIs in PM are rare but serious. management is traumatic for patients and costly. removal of implanted material requires transfer to specialist centre in Italy. Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust operates two acute hospitals with a total of approximately 700 beds. infection prevention remains one of our top priorities, and has a key focus from our Executive Board. observational study was conducted at an OR of one general hospital in japan. HH compliance rate was calculated using the WHO\u2019s 5 moments for HH. the bioquell Pod is a semi-permanent structure that is used to provide additional single-occupancy pods in multi-occupancy areas. a relative lack of side rooms (less than 10% of total critical care beds), two Pods were installed in the ICU. the Pods enabled isolation of high-risk patients (including CPE carriers) mupirocin is used to treat patients who are nasally colonised with MRSA. relapse at 4-weeks is more frequent with strains displaying low-level mupirocin resistance (LLR) compared to mupirocin sensitive (MupS) isolates. 9 LLR strains showed a decrease in viability comparable to the MupS isolates. 6/20 showed an ability to recover before a reduction in cell viability at 24h. 5/20 showed a clear recovery at 24h. a multi-occupancy ward into single rooms reduced infection / colonization rates. the one study that did not identify reduced infection lacked a control unit. single rooms can have drawbacks, such as negative patient experiences due to isolation. l Pod Caroline Bell City Hospitals has a mixture of single rooms and bays. patients with the same infectious disease are cohorted together in the bays. this can result in underutilisation of the ward, as empty beds in mixed bays cannot be used to accommodate patients with different infections. clinical lead and infection control team agreed to establish trust rate of infection, centralise data, monitoring and institute control measures for practice. results Three cases of endophthalmitis were identified from a total of 446 procedures. the program was implemented in the control ward, with no intervention in the control ward. a Qualitative (Training recollection) and Quantitative (ATP on 30 of the same devices) base-line audit was undertaken in both the control and test wards. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the burkholderia cepacia complex have the greatest impact on lung health so rapid, accurate identification methods are fundamental to the success of treatment and infection control strategies. results were compared to those generated by the BioMerieux Maldi-TOF available on-site and the Bruker Maldi-TOF available in other Scottish Laboratories. 6 point 60 day hand hygiene campaign launched trust wide in October 2013. overall compliance increased from 66% to 78%. behavioural change and the longevity of improved compliance is unknown. data collection has shown a number of themes where UHCW were not compliant with NICE (2008) SSI guidelines. a temperature specific audit was required to gain a more in depth analysis of hypothermia during -pre, peri and post operative stages. SARS, MERS and influenza have the capacity to survive on environmental surfaces for extended periods, sometimes measured in months. environmental sampling has identified contamination in field settings with SARS and influenza. the importance of contact transmission involving contamination of inanimate surfaces is uncertain. study aims to explore the knowledge and compliance of nurses working in west bank governmental hospitals with IC standards. participants\u2019 knowledge and compliance regarding specific IC policies were sought and ranked on a scale of 9 (9 is the best score that can be achieved) interpretation Education and training of healthcare personnel on IC standards are a prerequisite for ensuring policies and procedures are understood and practiced. results from this study are expected to guide efforts to develop educational programs to improve nursing IC practices in Palestine. this study provides information about nursing IC practices in west bank governmental hospitals. results from this study are expected to guide efforts to develop educational programs to improve nursing IC practices in Palestine. staff are aware of the need to report any difficulties with implementation/cannulation policy to the Nurse Manager / Senior Nurse Infection Control. improvement Issue and Context The clinical apheresis service undertakes approximately 2,000 apheresis procedures and 2,000 other procedures such as therapeutic venesection. no adverse events (staff exposures) have been reported. staff are aware of the need to report any difficulties with implementation/cannulation policy to the Nurse Manager / Senior Nurse Infection Control. six participants who had previously been catheterised said they preferred this. 6 with no previous experience said they preferred to avoid having a catheter. most patients reported no involvement in decision-making and said they received little or no information about benefits and risks. six participants who had previously been catheterised said they preferred this. 6 with no previous experience said they preferred to avoid having a catheter. most patients reported no involvement in decision-making. results show that patient satisfaction scores were greater during outbreaks in 78% of cases. this has generated local discussion in terms of whether a closed ward due to norovirus lends itself to a better nurse to patient ratio promoting more care time per patient. the net promoter question does not ask specific detail in terms of the patient\u2019s perception of cleanliness and hygiene. a simpler, less detailed satisfaction survey may provide a more stable measure of overall standards within the organisation and increase interpretability of changes in patient satisfaction trends over time. the NHS Trust in question is the sixth largest acute Trust in England. there were 444 patients with diarrhoea (and/or vomiting) who met the norovirus case definition. the high incidence of norovirus and challenging C.difficile target meant that there was an urgent need to develop new initiatives and \u201cthink outside the box\u201d a single-site collection of gram positive isolates (n=5) with unusual phenotypic and colonial characteristics was examined for SCV and wild type (WT) phenotypes. antimicrobial drug susceptibility profiling was carried out on both WT and the SCV colonies. small colony variants (SCVs) of different staphylococcal species were identified and characterized as typical SCVs with variable phenotypic and virulence profiles. a single-site collection of gram positive isolates (n=5) with unusual phenotypic and colonial characteristics was examined. evidence table gives details of each outbreak found including the species implicated, the number of patients affected, fatalities, proposed route of transmission and any suspected environmental involvement. HPS now has a proof of concept Outbreak Crib Card for one rare type of outbreak. evidence table gives details of each outbreak found including the species implicated, the number of patients affected, fatalities, proposed route of transmission and any suspected environmental involvement. HPS now has a proof of concept Outbreak Crib Card for one rare type of outbreak. three patients responded to changing the heparin-infusion apparatus and intravenous antibiotics. no further bacteraemias have occurred, but all had prolonged hospital stays, IV antibiotics, and additional investigations. three patients with IV-heparin-associated-bacteraemia were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing as Cupriavidus sp and Pseudomonas monteilii / P. plecoglossicida. no further bacteraemias have occurred. the sample consisted of 102 sophomore\u2019s nursing students. the students were assessed according to how well they understood the use of the personal protective equipment for the purpose of infection control, and how well they could incorporate the infection prevention technology under conditions of cough spray. 57.8% of the students demonstrated the importance of wearing a mask as PPE. the students also understood the basis of wearing a mask as PPE. Discussion PDR-AB is one of the important pathogenic bacteria in bloodstream infections in ICUs. fewer antibiotics can be selected for treating PDR-AB. the ICU should properly control over-usage of Imipenem. the ICU should strengthen its environmental hygiene, the disinfection of hands and its sterile operations to avoid the nosocomial transmission of PDR-AB. the main antiseptics tested were: polihexadine associated with betaine. the evidence supports the use of the antiseptic agent, combined with debridement, to reduce and even inhibit bacterial load and hinder the accession of new biofilm in the wound bed. also reinforcing the need for good practices associated with wound care to prevent biofilm formation. the evidence supports the use of the antiseptic agent, combined with debridement, to reduce and even inhibit bacterial load and hinder the accession of new biofilm in the wound bed. also reinforcing the need for good practices associated with wound care to prevent biofilm formation. majority of care homes (n=13, 61.9%) do not have criteria to guide TSV decisions. majority of both NHS (78.9%) and care home (78.8%) respondents believed TSV would be helpful in managing norovirus outbreaks. n=13, 61.9%) do not have criteria to guide TSV decisions. majority of care homes (78.9%) and care home (78.8%) believed TSV would be helpful in managing norovirus outbreaks. findings suggest current gap in policy guidance has resulted in fragmented picture nationally. the study was conducted from 2013 to 2014 in 50 hospitals. the compliances of each indicator were: TOS-79.4%; ESS-76%; OGS-65.5%; CPP-63.2%. overall performance was below that previously expected. the overall performance was below that previously expected, because of the lower values obtained in OGS and CPP indicators. the results of this study are alarming and motivate the need to recognize and characterize these programs in other regions of the country. to calculate the value of the numerator, the total amount of alcohol-based hand rub consumption was measured and divided by the amount of one-time usage. results To examine its validity, the HH compliance rates by the developed index were compared with those by a direct observation method. the HH compliance rates by the developed index were compared with those by a direct observation method. the average compliance rate from May to September 2012 by the index was 25.5%. the average HH compliance by the direct observation method at the same period was 33.4%. staff had a clear preference for the water-based product over existing alcohol rubs. IP&C issuing all staff with 50ml tottles of the new hand sanitiser. staff were impressed with how the product feels on their hands. staff were impressed with how the product feels on their hands and the fact it left no tackiness/residue on their skin. IP&C will install the water-based product as their hand sanitiser of choice once the new building is complete in 2015. Almost all orders were placed (64 [97%]) and collected (56 [92%]) within 72 hours of patients being admitted to the medicine units. early detection of ARO colonization/infection among high-risk patients being admitted to hospital is essential to minimize health care associated ARO transmission. early detection of ARO colonization/infection among high-risk patients being admitted to hospital is essential to minimize health care associated ARO transmission. a wide variety of different respirators are available across NHS Scotland. health protection Scotland has agreed a national risk assessment for the use of RPE in healthcare settings. the number of types of FFP3 respirator in use has been reduced from 23 to six. it is hoped this will simplify the procurement process and aid standardisation across NHS Scotland. the national infection prevention and control manual (NIP&CM) was developed and finalised. the first chapter of the NIP&CM, Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) was published in 2012 followed by Chapter 2, Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs), in 2014. Evidence of improvement The NIP&CM became mandatory in 2012. experts from a range of disciplines agreed pragmatic recommendations on issues with limited evidence. the recommendations formed the basis of the NIP&CM. the first chapter of the NIP&CM, Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) was published in 2012 followed by Chapter 2, Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs), in 2014. in 2008/2009 the blood culture contamination rate was above the national expectation at 5% and the health care acquired MRSA bacteraemia rate was ten. Methods and measurement A system was developed to ensure all necessary equipment for blood cultures was centrally located. within one year the contamination rate had reduced to the national expectation of 3%. equipment for blood cultures was centrally located with the aim of promoting Aseptic Non Touch Technique (ANTT) within one year the contamination rate had reduced to the national expectation of 3%. the infection prevention and control team (IPCT) worked collaboratively with other staff to ensure correct equipment was available in all clinical areas. there were no new cases for over 2 months. there were however over the next 6 months a number of cases identified from admission and weekly screening swabs. swabs were taken on a number of occasions from various sites. all patient isolates were sent for PFGE typing. a complete review of practices and decontamination took place. evidence of improvement We report the score compliance in three aspects of infection control namely five moments for hand hygiene, use of PPE and safe management of sharps. staff should pick up the sterile gauze with a nominated hand, dip into saline and pass it to the other hand or use forceps. staff must ensure that all packs and instruments are available at the beginning of the procedure. staff must ensure all packs and instruments are available at the beginning of the procedure. staff should avoid over use or unnecessary use of sterile gloves. the challenge remains to embed standard process in all areas. current developments in infection prevention and control (IPC) remain for the most part applied to healthcare professionals. however, professional rhetoric demonstrates concern that the hospital visitor poses a risk to IPC. such concern can give rise to tension between staff, patients and visitors. Methods TALL is a consistent and systematic approach to identify and follow patients with suspected TB based on acid fast bacilli orders from our patient care management system. 748 patients were identified by TALL and 592 required airborne precautions. of these, 156 were not placed on airborne precautions within 4 hours. Methods TALL is a consistent and systematic approach to identify and follow patients with suspected TB based on acid fast bacilli orders from our patient care management system. 748 patients were identified by TALL and 592 required airborne precautions. of these, 156 (26.3%) were not placed on airborne precautions within 4 hours. aim This study was designed to identify how the experience of nursing children affects nurses\u2019 decisions regarding compliance with SPGs. it clarifies paediatric nurses\u2019 understanding of factors affecting compliance and identifies their perceptions of how to increase compliance. children affects nurses\u2019 decisions regarding compliance with SPGs. it clarifies paediatric nurses\u2019 understanding of factors affecting compliance. it identifies their perceptions of how to increase compliance. SPCHAI team was composed of nurses (100%), physicians (95%) and pharmacists (34%). nurses worked daily more hours (8h-63%) than physicians (4h-44%) and pharmacists (2h-21%, 6h-21%) SPCHAI team was composed of nurses (100%), physicians (95%) and pharmacists (34%). nurses worked daily more hours (8h-63%) than physicians (4h-44%) and pharmacists (2h-21%, 6h-21%) retrospective review identified nine infections over 4 months. four cases required explantation. results Lack of information prevented historical PM SSI comparisons. SSIs in PM are rare but serious. management is traumatic for patients and costly. removal of implanted material requires transfer to a specialist centre in Italy. since march 2013, the Trust has operated HPV decontamination in house. a RAG-Rated cleaning system has been introduced to ensure a risk-based rationale is applied to decontamination. the trust has been able to ensure to a much greater level that patients are admitted to a safe environment. results The Trust C. difficile ceiling was 28 for year 2013/14; the result at the outturn was only 15 post-admission C. difficile cases. only 30% of hospitals (3/19) came within their trajectory. the protocol of this study was approved by the ethical review committee of the international university of health and welfare. results During the study period, 27 THA and TKA procedures were observed. the total observation time was 95.9 hours and the number of the required HH opportunities was 3,916. the protocol of this study was approved by the ethical review committee of international university of health and welfare. results During the study period, 27 THA and TKA procedures were observed. the number of the required HH opportunities was 3,916. the compliance rate of nurses was statistically significant higher than other CHCPs (p0.05). staff noted increased staffing pressures, isolation from colleagues and tiredness, reduced ability to respond to emergencies, heat gain, and delays in discharging patients to wards. Pods on the ICU are viewed as a positive addition to existing facilities, and have been generally well received by staff and patients. staff noted benefits: improved infection prevention and control capacity, increased footprint of the bed spaces, improved physical definition of the isolation cubicles, and the ability to terminally decontaminate using hydrogen peroxide vapour. future Steps The Pods on the ICU are viewed as a positive addition to existing facilities. adherent cells challenged with 200mg/l mupirocin for 24h. cells were then observed over a time-course of 1,4,6,12 and 24h. cell viability was determined using the metabolic-dye resazurin. 14 MupS (4 MRSA, 10 MSSA) and 20 LLR (19 MRSA, 1 MSSA) cells were attached to mucin-coated microtitre-plate wells for 4h. surface adherent cells challenged with 200mg/l mupirocin for 24h. the majority of bed spaces in the NHS are in multi-occupancy bays. the importance of single rooms in reducing transmission can be inferred by evaluating the impact of converting multi-occupancy bays to single rooms. the majority of bed spaces in the NHS are in multi-occupancy bays. studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported the impact of converting a multi-occupancy ward into a single occupancy ward including some measure of infection or colonization rate. the first CPE was identified within our Trust during 2009. the numbers increased considerably during 2010/2011. in order to manage the situation and limit spread, the Trust adopted a proactive response employing a number of management strategies in conjunction with Public Health England. patients with the same infectious disease are cohorted together in the bays. this can result in underutilisation of the ward, as empty beds in mixed bays cannot be used to accommodate patients with different infections. the bioquell Pod is a semi-permanent structure providing additional single room capacity within bays. the Pods were installed with minimal disruption, with the bay closed for five days during installation. patients and staff were satisfied with the Pod in >70% of their responses. the cases of endophthalmitis were retrieved from the infection control surveillance system. the numbers of procedures were obtained from all sites via pharmacy records and clinician records. the clinical lead developed a central data system with pharmacy and implemented a competency process for all new clinicians administering the implant. patient cases developed endophthalmitis at 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose respectively. trust rate of 1.149 was considered comparable to HURON study that reported one possible case of endophthalmitis in 153 procedures. ward achieved 100% compliance during the 12 week test period. quantitative audit - Utilising ATP The evidence from the study showed that the test ward, was able to reduce bioburden from visibly clean surfaces by 72%. control ward had an increase of 27% from its baseline audit. the control ward had an increase of 27% from its baseline audit. the improved understanding, technique and frequency of cleaning resulted in improved compliance leading to better cleaned devices. all 5 strains identified on the Bruker maldi-TOF were P.nitroreducens. all of 28 B.cepacia identified on the bioMerieux maldi-TOF were B.cenocepacia according to Bruker. results were compared to those generated by the BioMerieux Maldi-TOF available on-site and the Bruker Maldi-TOF available in other Scottish Laboratories. results were compared to those generated by the BioMerieux Maldi-TOF available on-site and the Bruker Maldi-TOF available in other Scottish Laboratories. Methods and Measurement A multifaceted approach was adopted across the trust with six key themes identified. the intention was to heighten awareness of the importance of hand hygiene to reduce HCAI and improve patient outcomes. each division devised a \u2018commitment to adhere to hand hygiene pledge\u2019 for all staff. each division devised a \u2018commitment to adhere to hand hygiene pledge\u2019 for all staff. each division devised a \u2018commitment to adhere to hand hygiene pledge\u2019 for all staff. the campaign provided a platform to further empower staff in challenging non compliance. collection of similar audits varied in response rate and audit completion has been unpredictable. data was collected on the day of surgery by recovery staff whilst the patient was awaiting theatre to ward transfer. the term \"cold\" was applied to temperatures of 35.9C and below. those requesting surgical specialities on day of admission had 45% chance of remaining so, 97% remained warm post operatively, providing strong evidence towards pre-operative warming. strain variation, titre, substrate, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity influence the survival of these viruses on surfaces. the frequent use of molecular methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. environmental sampling has identified contamination in field settings with SARS and influenza. the frequent use of molecular methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. the findings include the need to wear appropriate PPE to account for contact and droplet transmission routes. a cross-sectional study was conducted in a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to July 2013. 240 units (20.8%) responded and consented to the survey invitation. 77% of the questions on knowledge and attitude, and about 31% of the questions on behaviour had over 80% choosing the ideal response. the most frequent complication of intermittent catheterisation is urinary tract infection (UTI), but user acceptability and ease of use are also important. it is unclear which catheter designs, techniques and strategies affect the incidence of UTI, are acceptable to users. the workbook is designed so each member of staff receive their own copy and can work through it at their own pace. the workbook provides latest national guidance and evidence-based information on topics such as hand hygiene, standard precautions, MRSA, Clostridium difficile, MRGNB and norovirus. the Workbook is kept by member of staff as part of their portfolio of evidence of learning and can be used as a reference guide for day-to-day working. the Workbook has been extremely well received by all our GP Practices and is viewed as best practice by local CQC inspectors. the position of nurses within the organization may also impact on how nurses view the seasonal influenza vaccination programme. a recommendation from this study is that health care policy makers should collaborate with nurses to reach a concordant holistic policy that considers the well being and concerns of nurses. s, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were screened for MRSA in the urine before catheterisation. after 12 months, the data will be analysed looking at MRSA in the urine and at the catheter site. a follow-up screen 2-3 days post treatment was carried out to determine if the treatment was successful. results In total, there were 799 MRSA swabs taken during the two completed surveillance periods which were 3 months apart. the prevalence for the first screen was 10.3% and 6.8% for the second. food handlers have a major role in the prevention of food poisoning during food production and distribution. but food contamination by food handlers could occur and lead to foodborne diseases if they lack knowledge and neglect of their personal hygiene on food handling practices. cross-sectional study involved 30 university support staff who sent their children to nurseries. participants were given questionnaires related to hand hygiene, hand hygiene practices during the care of children and infection related to poor hand hygiene. results The mean score for knowledge of hand hygiene was 2.71 0.257 out of 3. this study suggests improved knowledge around MRSA for both the community nurse and the patient. more detailed information about how and when to use the treatment is an essential part of the treatment and is likely to make an important contribution to treatment outcomes. trauma and contact lens wear are the most important risk factors for corneal ulcers. trauma and contact lens wear are the most important risk factors for corneal ulcers. glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. prostaglandin analogues have been used widely in its therapy. there have been few case reports suggesting the potential association between the topical use of prostaglandin analogues and herpes simplex virus recurrence. syphilis is an infectious systemic disease that mimics clinical entities. it has re-emerged in several developed countries. the study is to present a case of acute, progressive visual loss. inpatient treatment with IV acyclovir and methylprednisolone was started. results A reduction in retinitis foci number was observed, the hypopyon was diminished and the visual acuity of the LE was improved to 1/10 after 2 days of treatment. multiple sclerosis is a well-known cause of optic neuritis. the patient was treated with steroids IV (1g pulsed for 3 days and subsequent tapering) with a dramatic improvement of his ocular symptoms and signs. a 78 year old female patient was admitted to the department of Dermatology for the investigation of skin lesions. she developed bilateral herpetic keratitis related to long-term immunosuppression. the patient complained of blurred vision, pain, foreign body sensation, tearing and redness. patients with systemic diseases on long-term corticosteroid treatment are immunosuppressed. they are at high risk for reactivation of latent HSV infections. lack of training is the main underlying issue. all staff expressed preference for face to face, group learning rather than e learning. aim is a reduction in duration of outbreaks and number of exposed vulnerable individuals. having flu in the past six months, preferred self-medication and preferred self-medication were risk factors of diarrhoea. interventions such as self-reporting online portal, early emphasis since young age, provision of alcohol-based disinfectant on public transport system and annual hygiene campaign were well-accepted. 240 units (20.8%) responded and consented to the survey invitation. about 77% of the questions on knowledge and attitude, and about 31% of the questions on behaviour had over 80% choosing the ideal response. having flu in the past six months, preferred self-medication were risk factors of diarrhoea. it is unclear which catheter designs, techniques and strategies affect the incidence of UTI, are acceptable to users and are cost effective. it is unclear which catheter

that collective vaccination is required to elicit protection for older persons in the residential long term care setting. findings further suggest that the position of nurses within the organization may also impact on how nurses view the seasonal influenza vaccination programme. a recommendation from this study is that policy makers should collaborate with nurses to reach a concordant holistic policy that considers the well being and concerns of nurses as well as patients. four hundred and seventy seven patients with a long term urethral or supra pubic catheter are cared for by local Continence service. urethral or supra pubic catheter were screened for MRSA in the urine before catheterisation. data will be analysed looking at MRSA in the urine and at the catheter site. rates of E. coli and Klebsiella will also be monitored. all patients with an indwelling urethral or supra pubic catheter were screened for MRSA in the urine before catheterisation. after 12 months, the data will be analysed looking at MRSA in the urine and at the catheter site. if a resident was found to be MRSA nasal positive they were prescribed a 5 day course of topical treatments. a follow-up screen 2-3 days post treatment was carried out to determine if the treatment was successful. screen 2-3 days after treatment was carried out to determine if the treatment was successful. if a resident remained positive, a second course of treatment was prescribed. the prevalence for the first screen was 10.3% and 6.8% for the second. this study was aimed to assess the level knowledge, attitude and practices among food handlers in Kuala Lumpur. the information consisting of demographic, knowledge, attitude and practices on personal hygiene was collected using self-administered questionnaire. overall results showed that the majority of the food handlers had a good knowledge, attitude and practices on personal hygiene. study evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practice of hand hygiene among parents. the mean score for knowledge of hand hygiene was 2.71 0.257 out of 3 and 4.54 0.362 out of 5 respectively. a pilot study evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practice of hand hygiene among parents. participants were given questionnaires related to personal hand hygiene, hand hygiene practices during the care of children and infection related to poor hand hygiene. results The mean score for knowledge of hand hygiene was 2.71 0.257 out of 3 and 4.54 0.362 out of 5 respectively. the patient who received the enhanced education reported better knowledge and understanding of the application of treatment. this study suggests improved knowledge around MRSA for both the community nurse and the patient and is therefore more likely to ensure treatment is adhered to and effective. this pilot study highlights the need for further research to establish more effective ways to educate patients around the management of MRSA in primary care. the aim of the study was to identify the predisposing risk factors in patients with corneal ulcers and evaluate the management outcome. the percentage of contact lens wearers was 23%. 15% had a medical history of herpetic keratitis, 13% had bullous keratopathy and 5% history of corneal transplant. the percentage of contact lens wearers was 23%, while 15% had a medical history of herpetic keratitis, 13% had bullous keratopathy and 5% history of corneal transplant. the location of corneal ulcer was central in 48% of them. a 65 year old female patient attended the outpatient glaucoma clinic complaining of blurred vision, pain, redness, tearing, photophobia and foreign body sensation in her right eye. she had been treated with prostaglandin analogue (first line treatment) for a week before the development of the above mentioned symptoms. glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness and prostaglandin analogues have been used widely in its therapy. there have been few case reports suggesting the potential association between the topical use of prostaglandin analogues and herpes simplex virus recurrence causing keratitis. syphilis is an infectious systemic disease that mimics clinical entities. it has re-emerged in several developed countries. a 45 year old male was referred to our clinic from an ophthalmologist. inpatient treatment with IV acyclovir and methylprednisolone was started. results a reduction in retinitis foci number was observed, the hypopyon was diminished and the visual acuity of the LE was improved to 1/10 after 2 days of treatment. best-corrected visual acuity (10/10 in the right eye and counting fingers at 30 cm in the left eye, anterior uveitis (hypopyon)/posterior uveitis (vitritis) and multiple retinitis foci were examined. corticosteroids were discontinued and laboratory testing for syphilis (RPR, VDRL, FTA-ABS) turned out to be positive. a 25-year-old male presented at the outpatient department complaining of acute visual loss in his right eye with no associated symptoms and signs. he was a cattleman and his personal/family history was unremarkable. the results were compatible with acute neuroretinitis and optic neuritis confirmed by OCT examination. brucellosis can affect any ocular structure and present with a variety of symptoms. the signs and symptoms of it can be nonspecific, mimicking those of other diseases. it should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis of optic neuritis. the patient was treated with steroids IV (1g pulsed for 3 days and subsequent tapering) with a dramatic improvement of his ocular symptoms and signs. systemic antibiotics were added to medication. diagnosis of subcorneal Pustular Dermatosis (Sneddon and Wilkinson syndrome) and treatment with dapsone. she developed haemolysis as a side effect of the above medication. after 3 weeks of initiation of corticosteroid treatment, the patient complained of blurred vision, pain, foreign body sensation, tearing and redness in both eyes. the patient complained of blurred vision, pain, foreign body sensation, tearing and redness in both eyes. the slit lamp examination revealed characteristic dendritic corneal ulcers in both eyes. the patient was treated with antiviral agents (acyclovir 3% ointment five times daily) we conducted 2 training events. A total of 118 staff attended. from workshop discussions we found a wide variation in infection control training provision, although most had this at induction and the majority had an annual refresher. quality was described as good to poor. all staff expressed preference for face to face, group learning rather than e learning. aim is a reduction in duration of outbreaks and number of exposed vulnerable individuals."}
