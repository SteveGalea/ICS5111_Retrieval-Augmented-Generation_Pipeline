{"summary": "CVB3 is a positive-sense RNA virus, belonging to the Picornaviridae family. it can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis, and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue. no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection. the precise regulation of these proteases, their activities, and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood. to investigate how polyamines facilitate CVB3 infection, we performed a screen for virus escape mutants that were resistant to DFMO treatment. 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion, to which mutant 2A and 3C proteases were resistant. together, these data suggest that polyamines are crucial for viral protease activity and that we may target CVB3 proteolytic activity. mutagenic PCR with Phusion polymerase (thermo-Fisher) used primers in this study.

RNA was purified from the cellular supernatant, reverse transcribed, amplified using CVB3-specific primers. mutants were confirmed by manual chromatogram verification. DFMO and DENSpm Sensitivity Assays Vero cells were treated with either 100 M to 2000 M DFMO for 4 days or 1 m to 100 M DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1. the virus was then passed to new cells by transferring 50 L supernatant. transfections 293T cells were plated at 80%\u201390% confluency. they were either treated with 100 M, 500 M, 1000 M or 2000 M DFMO for 4 days or left untreated. the transfection was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Western Blot Samples were collected with Bolt LDS Buffer and Bolt Reducing Agent. gels were transferred using the iBlot 2 gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen) thin layer chromatography determination of polyamines Polyamines were separated by thin-layer chromatography as previously described. cells were treated as described prior to being trypsinized and centrifuged. samples were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% new-born calf serum. HeLa and 293T cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

RNA was extracted and purified from supernatants and reverse transcribed. Sanger sequencing was used to determine whether mutations were stable over the passages. the plasmids were transfected using LipoD293 (SignaGen Laboratories, Rockville, MD, USA) the transfection was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. the transfection was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and visualized on FluorChem E imager (Protein Simple, San Jose, CA, USA) Plaque Size Measurement To quantify relative plaque sizes of the different CVB3 mutants, Vero cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and grown to confluence. excess dansyl chloride was cleared by incubating the reaction with 100 L 150 mg/mL proline (Sigma Aldrich) Dansylated polyamines were extracted with 50 L toluene (Sigma Aldrich) and centrifuged. five microliter of sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate. virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 M to 5 mM. titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection. titers were determined by plaque assay. CVB3 mutations in 2A and 3C proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. mutations in 2A and 3C proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. mutations in 2A and 3C proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. viral titers were determined by plaque assay at 48 hpi. titers from (A) were used to calculate percent replication in DFMO. titers from (A) were used to calculate the percent replication in DFMO. compared to wildtype virus, all mutants exhibited higher replication. protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance. mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO-treated cells. vero cells were infected with wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h. viral titers were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant. ratio of genomes to infectious virus (pfu) calculated. we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus. no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size. we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A29K or 3C52R. after five passages, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, amplified viral genomes. cleaved eIF4G is a cellular target of the viral proteases. in infected cells, a distinct eIF4G band was present. in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm, eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted. we cloned a 2A target sequence\u2014MTNTGAFG\u2014in to the firefly luciferase reporter [37]. to generate this system, we cloned a 3C target sequence\u2014AMEQG\u2014into the firefly luciferase reporter [37]. this system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases. at 24 h, we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone (no protease) both 2AWT and 3CWT exhibited robust protease activity, even in DFMO-treated cells. mutant proteases may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication. in untreated cells, we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G. eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection. the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 M to 5 mM. titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection were determined intermittently. titers were determined by plaque assay for the passages as shown. mutations in 2A and 3C proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. mutations in 2A and 3C proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. no mutations were observed in the same lineage. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay at 48 hpi. titers from (A) were used to calculate the percent replication in DFMO. titers from (A) were used to calculate the percent replication in DFMO. the titer in DFMO treatment conditions (500 M) showed higher replication compared to wildtype virus. protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance. mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO-treated cells. however, this difference was not statistically significant. vero cells were infected with wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h. viral titers were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant. the ratio of genomes to infectious virus (pfu) calculated. we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A29K or 3C52R. after five passages, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, amplified viral genomes by PCR, and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to each protease. lysates were analyzed for the presence of cleaved eIF4G. in infected cells, a distinct eIF4G band was present. however, in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm, eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted. to directly measure viral protease activity in cells, we generated a protease-sensitive dual luciferase reporter system. this system allows for robust firefly luciferase activity, which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control. to generate this system, we cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression. 2A29K and 3C52R exhibited robust protease activity, even in DFMO-treated cells. 293T cells were treated with 500 M DFMO or left untreated and transfected with empty vector. mutant proteases may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication. in untreated cells, we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3-2A29K. both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine-depleted cells with either of these mutations. these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment. the function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells. we previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo. emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication. as viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals, potential therapy would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance."}
