{"summary": "Pristine carbon dots (CDs) derived from citric acid pyrolysis are used in a variety of biomedical research such as imaging and drug delivery. however, potential cytotoxic effects of pyrolysis temperature on cells is underexplored. carbonization or pyrolysis methods were exploited to fabricate multicolor CDs. CDs have found applications in biological sensing [17], bioimaging [18, 19, 20, 21], drug delivery, and photovoltaic devices. low-cost, rapid, and reliable synthesis of high quality and low cytotoxic CDs in large scales is still highly desirable [26] induced toxicity, and cellular uptake under different experimental conditions. results indicate only little cytotoxicity at the highest concentration of CDs to normal and cancer cell lines. our optimized synthesis may be used to prepare safe CDs as drug carriers and imaging probes. carbon dots with high yield were directly synthesized by pyrolizing citric acid in different time and temperature range. the CDs possess bright blue luminescence. aliquot of MTT solution at 5 mg/mL in PBS was added to each well. content of each well was dissolved by the adding 100 L of a solubilizing solution for 15 min at room temperature. the absorbance was measured at 570 nm and with a 630 nm reference using a microplate reader. cells were washed with a fluorescent inverted microscope at 365 nm excitation and 470 nm emission wavelengths. 1104 SKBR3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in complete RPMI-1640 medium. after 48 h, increasing concentrations of four CDs formations were added for 24 h. culture reagents including RPMI-1640 medium, DMEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin/EDTA, and phosphate buffered saline were purchased from Gibco. synthesis and characterization of fluorescent CDs CDs were prepared by directly pyrolyzing citric acid. quinine sulfate in H2SO4 (0.1 M, QY = 0.54) at 365 nm was selected as the standard. a low absorbance was used to determine the QY of the samples. the absorbance of supernatants was measured at 570 nm and with a 630 nm reference using a microplate reader. data were collected in triplicates and from four independent parallel experiments. cell viability was calculated as the ratio of absorbance of sample cells containing CDs to vehicle control cells without any CDs. 1104 SKBR3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in complete RPMI-1640 medium. after 48 h, increasing concentrations of four CDs formations were added for 24 h. the plates were irradiated using white light for 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C. the 160-50 sample showed a strong fluorescence with QY of 29.4% when exposed to UV light at 365 nm. this QY is significantly higher than that from previous reports, i.e., 4\u201310% [36]. all four samples showed negative zeta potential values in the range of -6.96 mv to -16.0 mv for the 160-50 samples. the 160-50 samples showed a 130% increase in negative surface charges. BR3 and MCF-12A cells treated with different formations of CDs for 24 h were not affected at concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml. the 160-50 sample caused the largest cytotoxicity and significantly reduced the cell viability to 78% and 70% at 1.5 and 2.0 mg/ml. in MCF-12A cells, the largest LDH release at 2.0 mg/ml of 160-50, 180-40, 200-30, and 220-20 formations were 14.76% 0.20, 10.81% 0.28, 9.87% 0.11, 10.73% 0.23. greater toxicity of the 160-50 sample than the other three formations is most likely due to its significantly larger zeta potential. between the results for 1 h and 2 h in Figure 8 became significant at a level of 0.05. the average percentages of cell viability SKBR3 cells in different samples 160-50, 180-40, 200-30, 220-20 and concentrations (0.1\u20132.0 mg/ml) we synthesized CDs under four different temperature-time conditions. the 160-50 sample showed a strong fluorescence with QY of 29.4% when exposed to UV light at 365 nm. this QY is significantly higher than that from previous reports. CDs dynamic light scattering (DLS) was employed to determine the size distribution of CDs dynamic light scattering (DLS) the result showed that CDs were under 5 nm in diameter (Figure 3d), in accordance with previous reports that showed the size distribution of carbon dots was under 10nm [41, 42]. fluorescent intensity of an aqueous solution of CDs was measured 6 months after preparing them. CDs completely retained their fluorescent property. photo-stability studies suggest that CDs have a great potential in biological applications such as cell imaging, biosensing, and drug/gene delivery [44]. asterisks indicate difference between the 160-50 (2 mg/ml) and the other CDs. the 160-50 CDs resulted in a significant membrane damage at concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/ml. the other three formations compromised membrane integrity only at 2.0 mg/ml. cells treated with CDs had comparable morphology to the vehicle control cells. the different formations of CDs did not have significantly different cellular uptake. the extent of uptake of different CDs did not cause differences in their cytotoxicity. in this model, V_i,j,k is the rate of survival of the cell in our kth experimental observation when the time factor is set on its ith level and the concentration is set on its jth level. there are four levels of time, i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, and six levels of concentration, i.e., 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mg/ml. we synthesized carbon dots (CDs) through thermal decomposition of citric acid at different temperatures and time durations. the CDs were smaller than 5 nm with a negative surface charge. our analysis of cytotoxicity and photo-induced toxicity of CDs demonstrated their biocompatibility. contributions statement Neda Esfandiari: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper."}
