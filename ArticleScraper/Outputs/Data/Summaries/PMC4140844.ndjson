{"summary": "dromedary camels are suspected to be involved in zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV [2]\u2013[5]. camels as well as horse DPP4 can efficiently facilitate virus entry [6], the mechanism(s) by which most people acquire MERS-CoV is still unclear. developing effective treatment strategies remains a high priority. in the rhesus macaque, MERS-CoV causes a transient infection of the lower respiratory tract resulting in mild to moderate clinical disease. this model seems to recapitulate the mild disease observed in some human cases, rather than the more severe or even lethal disease observed in many human cases. analyses were performed using human DPP4 (known to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) [17] and ferret DPP4 (unable to bind MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein) no amino acid differences were identified within the DPP4 region interacting with the MERS-CoV RBD. PP4 homology model was built using the human DPP4 structure. all amino acid differences between human and marmoset DPP4 were located away from the binding region of DPP4 with the S1 portion of the spike glycoprotein. Arg343, Ile193 and Val279 are 14A, 10A and 13A away, respectively, from the nearest atom in MERS-S. starting on 1 dpi six of nine animals showed increased respiration rates. all animals had increased respiration rates from 2 dpi onwards. peak clinical scores were observed between 4 and 6 dpi. animals euthanized on 3, 4 and 6 dpi showed hypoproteinemia consistent with high protein pulmonary effusions resulting from alveolar edema. CM1\u2013CM9 indicate the study animals. animals were scored daily and mean clinical score SD calculated. dpi shows gross pathology of the lungs from CM5 and CM9 necropsied on 4 dpi. three animals were euthanized on 3 dpi and necropsies were performed. all three animals had relatively comparable gross lesions. no other gross pathological changes were observed at necropsy. pneumonia tended to be centered on small caliber and terminal bronchioles. pneumonia tended to be centered on small caliber and terminal bronchioles. the distribution of DPP4 in marmoset lungs included type I pneumocytes, bronchiolar epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells. one of the surviving animals (CM7) had to be euthanized prior to the scheduled end of the study (48 dpi) and was found to have severe aspiration pneumonia. interstitial pneumonia centered on terminal bronchioles, with influx of inflammatory cells and thickening of alveolar septa in lung tissue collected on 3 dpi. IHC staining of sequential section of panel C reveals abundance of MERS-CoV antigen in affected areas. viral loads in swabs decreased over time and all swabs were negative by 20 dpi. swabs collected from CM5 and CM9 at the time of euthanasia were viremic. swabs were collected from animals CM1\u2013CM6 and CM9. the number of animals included in the analysis at each time point in (A) is indicated above the graph. RNA was extracted and viral load determined as TCID50 equivalents per gram of tissue by qRT-PCR. high viral loads were detected in respiratory tissues. samples were collected from areas of the lung that contained gross lesions. they were compared to the total RNAseq data from the lung of a single uninfected marmoset. we reasoned that molecules induced by infection would at least double in abundance over the course of infection. red molecules are those upregulated in the data set, teal molecules are those downregulated in the dataset. orange molecules are those predicted to be activated, and dark blue molecules are those predicted to be inhibited. orange lines indicate a predicted activation effect, blue lines indicate a predicted inhibitory effect, and gray lines indicate a relationship without a known or predicted activity or inhibition. we observed significant down regulation of IL-8 and IL-18 at all time points. IL-1 was up regulated in the 4 dpi samples, but down regulated at 3 and 6 dpi. MAP tool uses relationships with molecules neighboring the DE transcripts to predict transcriptional behavior. interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF predicted to be at least partially inhibited. time points for sampling may have been too late to catch TNF induction as it is one of the first induced during inflammation. amino acid differences between human, rhesus macaque and common marmoset were identified within the DPP4 region interacting with the MERS-CoV RBD. the 100% identity of the 14 amino acid residues between human and marmoset in the interaction regions indicates that MERS-CoV RBD should bind to marmoset DPP4. marmoset and ferret DPP4 have been identified to interact with the receptor binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein. common marmosets develop severe respiratory disease following inoculation with MERS-CoV via the intraracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes. euthanized animals showed hypoproteinemia consistent with high protein pulmonary effusions resulting from alveolar edema. most animals showed a decrease in body temperature by 3 dpi. the two animals that were euthanized on 4 dpi were hypothermic. pi four of nine animals showed mild to marked diffuse interstitial infiltration. on 3 dpi interstitial infiltration of varying severity was noted in all animals bilaterally in the lower lobes. one animal had severe infiltration in all lobes with congested bronchioles. by 9 dpi the remaining animals showed improvement, with lessening infiltration, which was resolved by 13 dpi. animals euthanized due to severity of disease on 4 dpi showed severe lesions throughout the lungs. lungs were firm, failed to collapse and were fluid filled. lungs from animal CM5 were three times the lung weight to body weight ratio of the lungs from the other sampled animals. alveolar spaces contained moderate to marked numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils. multifocally there was pulmonary edema, fibrin, and less frequently hemorrhage. there were also rare multinucleate syncytia within alveolar spaces. common marmosets were euthanized on day 3, 4 or 6 post inoculation. acute bronchointerstitial pneumonia centered on terminal bronchioles. influx of inflammatory cells and thickening of alveolar septa in lung tissue. type II pneumocyte hyperplasia is visible on 6 dpi. IHC staining indicates viral antigen has been mostly cleared from remodeling tissue. 5 and CM9 at the time of euthanasia at 4 dpi contained the highest viral loads. in the surviving animals, viral loads in the swabs decreased over time and all swabs were negative by 20 dpi. a terminal blood sample was collected from animals CM1\u2013CM6 and CM9. RNA was not detected in the lungs, or other tissues, from the two surviving animals that were euthanized on 48 and 55 dpi. in all animals except CM6 (6 dpi), virus could be isolated from one or more lung lobes. uninfected control lung with higher expression and greater pathway enrichment occurring at 4 and 6 dpi than at 3 dpi. activation of pathways associated with inflammation, vascularization, endothelial activation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and tissue repair. robust antiviral transcriptional responses were induced in the marmoset lungs. up regulation of innate immune genes such as pattern recognition receptors, interferon-stimulated genes, inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules were observed. the MAP tool uses relationships with molecules neighboring the DE transcripts in this dataset to predict transcriptional behavior. the MAP tool uses relationships with molecules neighboring the DE transcripts in this dataset to predict transcriptional behavior. clinical disease was more severe than in the rhesus macaque, was of longer duration and resulted in euthanasia of some animals. two of the six animals that were not euthanized at the scheduled 3 dpi necropsy had to be euthanized due to severity of disease. the acute renal failure in some patients [21] may be a secondary effect of ARDS [30] or other comorbidities and not primarily the result of direct MERS-CoV damage to the kidneys. previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have demonstrated that pulmonary fibrosis was a major mechanism of disease progression. the rhesus macaque model allows the evaluation of intervention strategies at later time points. late treatment that targets the virus is unlikely to be successful once significant lung damage has already occurred. future transcriptional studies may yield early indicators of disease progression that can be used as diagnostic or prognostic tests to improve clinical management. animals were fed a combination of commercial New World monkey chow, rice cereal supplemented with calcium, ZuPreem marmoset, wax worms/larvae and fruit twice daily by trained personnel. animals were euthanized by exsanguination under deep isoflurane anesthesia. in-study euthanasia criteria were established prior to the start of the experiment. animals CM5 and CM9 were euthanized on 4 dpi as they reached euthanasia criteria. on 1, 3, 6, 9, 13 and 20 days post inoculation, clinical exams were performed. amino acid and binding energy comparison between human and marmoset DPP4 was generated using the human, ferret and marmoset DPP4s. the initial model was built using Nest [36] based on the amino acid alignment and the human DPP4 structure. the structural model was briefly optimized using the TINKER minimization program \"minimize.x\" veroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin. after fixation for 7 days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the TRIzol was phase separated and total RNA was purified from the aqueous phase using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cells were washed once with DMEM and supplemented with virus isolation medium. clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina version 2 miSeq reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 1000 K\u20131200 K clusters/mm2. the resulting libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system at single reads of 50 bp. next generation sequencing Raw reads were trimmed to 50 base pairs (bp) and adapter sequences were removed. animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. animals were fed a combination of commercial New World monkey chow, rice cereal supplemented with calcium, ZuPreem marmoset, wax worms/larvae and fruit twice daily by trained personnel. the work with infectious HCoV-EMC/2012 was approved under BSL3 conditions by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. sample inactivation was performed according to standard operating procedures approved by the IBC for removal of specimens from high containment.
