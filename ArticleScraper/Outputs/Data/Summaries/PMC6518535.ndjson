{"summary": "bats are among the taxa that can adapt to the urban environment [1\u20133] of the 178 species recorded in Brazil [4], at least 84 (47.2%) occur in urban areas [5]. generalist species may benefited from the availability of artificial roosts and food items, such as fruits from urban trees. rabies surveillance system performed by local health authorities is based on monitoring the occurrence of rabies in domestic animals by surveilling deceased and euthanised dogs showing neurological symptoms in public shelters. rabies control is based on the mass vaccination of at least 80% of the estimated dog and cat populations, clinical observation of dogs and cats that bite a human for at least 10 days after the attack, post-exposure vaccination for the attack victims and emergency vaccination of all unvaccinated dogs and cats within the number of notifications increased slowly until 2010, when 488 bats were captured. a mean number of 536 bats were retrieved from Campinas households yearly. the probability of bat-associated RABV to be transmitted from bats to dogs and cats is higher than that of carnivore-associated RABV. data from the UVZ bat rabies passive surveillance were compiled from 2011 to 2015. included the species, address, geographic coordinates, date, location of the bat (inside, outside the building or household) and health status (dead or alive) of bats. the list of bat species collected during the study period was compared with the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (itis.gov) the areas of occurrence of all species were verified in the SpeciesLink network database (splink.org.br) the biological features (size, weight, colony size, feeding habits, reproduction and roost type) of the bat species collected during the study period. a kernel-smoothing with a 10 km bandwidth radius was performed using the heat map plugin of QGIS. contour lines were extracted using the Extraction plugin of QGIS. the difference function crossed the positive values of its associated envelope. data from the different years were stratified by months and the density ratio was calculated using the spattemp.density function. the asymptotic tolerance contours (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001) were obtained to identify significantly increased relative risk areas. the study region was the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. all reported data had their geographic coordinates associated, which allowed locating them on thematic maps. the general characteristics (sex, reproductive status) and the circumstances in which the specimens were found were described in proportions. the reproductive status (mature or immature) was defined by the presence of testes in males and mammary glands and nipples in the subaxillary region in females. RABV-positive sample clusters were identified when the difference function crossed the positive values of its associated envelope. a kernel-smoothing with a 10 km bandwidth radius was performed using the Heat Map plugin of QGIS. the analysis was made for the species and genera with more than 100 collected specimens during the study period. the proportions of bat species or genera with more than 100 collected specimens in each urban zoning stratum were compared using the prop.test() function of R. the proportions of bat species or genera with more than 100 collected specimens were compared using the prop.test() function of R. the most numerous species (n > 100) were M. molossus (n = 873), C. planirostris (n = 175), E. glaucinus (n = 146), T. brasiliensis (n = 140) and G. soricina (n = 109). 0 0 5 Eumops 100 (48) 100 (48) 10 (4) 31 (15) 161 (77) 18 (8) 87 (41) 81 (39) 42 (20) 66 (32) 129 (61) 15 (7) 210 E. glaucinus 73 (50) 69 (47) 4 (3) 24 (17) 113 (77) 9 (6) 48 (33) 65 (44) 33 (23) 47 (32) 88 (60) 11 (8) 146 E. perotis 22 (41) 8) 14 (58) 1 (4) 6 (25) 17 (71) 1 (4) 10 (42) 9 (38) 5 (20) 8 (33) 16 (67) 0 24 Nyctinomops 25 (47) 27 (51) 1 (2) 5 (9) 42 (80) 6 (11) 35 (66) 8 (15) 10 (19) 13 (24) 40 (76) 0 53 N. laticaudatus 9 (50) 8 (44) 1 (6) 4 (22) 11 (61) 3 (17) 15 (83) 0 (21) 115 (46) 131 (52) 6 (2) 252 Phyllostomidae 137 (42) 166 (51) 22 (7) 27 (8) 241 (74) 57 (18) 106 (33) 141 (43) 78 (24) 206 (63) 106 (33) 13 (4) 325 Artibeus 58 (42) 73 (53) 6 (5) 16 (12) 97 (71) 24 (17) 91 (67) 22 (16) 89 (65) 45 (33) 3 (2) 137 (2j/4) 3 (60) 2 (40) 0 0 5 (100) 0 1 (20) 3 (60) 1 (20) 1 (20) 1 (20) 4 (80) 0 5 Platyrrhinus 11 (44) 13 (52) 1 (4) 1 (4) 22 (88) 2 (8) 13 (52) 5 (20) 7 (28) 14 (56) 10 (40) 1 (4) 25 Platyrrhinus lineatus 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 ( 6 (6) 37 (37) 44 (43) 20 (20) 41 (41) 47 (46) 13 (13) 101 Eptesicus brasiliensis 2 (67) 1 (33) 0 0 2 (67) 1 (33) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 1 (33) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 1 (33) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 0 1 (33) 2 (67) 0 1 (3 0 1 (25) 3 (75) 0 3 (75) 0 1 (25) 4 L. cinereus 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 (100) 0 1 (100) 0 0 1 a Cynomops abrasus and C. planirostris. b Eumops auripendulus, E. bonariensis, E. glaucinus, E. hansae and E. perotis. most of the specimens were male (52%), and similar proportions of genera were observed between families. a higher proportion of females were observed in Eumops (48%; P = 0.02) and Tadarida (55%; P = 0.001) than in Molossus (40%). for the reproductive status, most of the specimens were mature (69%), but the proportion of immature of Molossidae (18%; P 0.001) was significantly higher than that of Phyllos Phyllostomidae (63%) were more frequently captured dead than Molossidae (36%; P 0.001) and Vespertilionidae (49%; P 0.001).

RABV prevalence was higher in Phyllostomidae (6.5%) than in other families. Phyllostomidae exhibit reduced fitness because they are larger and heavier. females are therefore more susceptible to seasonal changes in climate and food availability. tilionidae are the family most capable of using man-made structures. excess relative risk for RABV infection was observed downtown throughout the year. RABV was not diagnosed in the two abundant species of Molossidae, C. planirostris and E. glaucinus. this measure will end the mass vaccination of dogs and cats against rabies. this is most likely making most susceptible to bat or wildlife RABV."}
