{"summary": "influenza was associated with nearly 10 percent of hospitalized SARI cases and one-sixth of outpatient ILI cases. most influenza-associated SARI cases were in children 2 years old. most influenza-associated SARI cases were in children 2 years old. in 2008, an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza occurred in children 5 years old, including an estimated 28,000\u2013111,500 deaths. in sub-saharan africa, surveillance for influenza has been extremely limited, likely due to a combination of limited public health infrastructure in the region. seven provincial general hospitals (Coast, Embu, Garissa, Kakamega, Nakuru, New Nyanza and Nyeri) and two refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) at each site, surveillance was conducted for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). in august 2009, we initiated SARI surveillance at Siaya District Hospital (SDH) and ILI surveillance at Tingwang'i Health Center (THC), and Illness Influenza-like illness was defined as an axillary temperature 38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in an outpatient of any age. a modified version of the world health organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness definition for pneumonia was used. for children 5 years old, SARI was defined as axillary temperature 38\u00b0C plus cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from 140 L aliquots of each specimen using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) rRT-PCR was carried out using the AgPath kit (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) we excluded patients for whom demographic data or laboratory results were missing. we used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios in bi-variate and multivariate analyses. surveillance was conducted for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) at each site, surveillance was conducted for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in 2009, we initiated SARI surveillance at Siaya District Hospital (SDH) and ILI surveillance at Tingwang'i Health Center (THC) and discontinued influenza surveillance at new Nyanza Provincial Hospital. severe acute respiratory illness was defined as an axillary temperature 38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in an outpatient of any age. for children 5 and those 5 years old, a modified version of the world health organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness definition for pneumonia [12] was used, requiring the presence of cough or difficulty breathing plus one of the following danger signs. NP and OP swabs were placed into a single cryovial with viral transport medium (VTM) Specimens were immediately refrigerated at 2\u20138 degrees Celsius. samples from the two refugee camps were transported directly to the KEMRI/CDC-K laboratory in Nairobi. influenza A virus by rRT-PCR but failed to sub-type were sent to the WHO Influenza Collaborating Center at CDC-Atlanta, GA, USA for further antigenic characterization. smart phones (HTC Touch Pro 2 model) collected demographic and clinical data from patients in five hospitals. sentinel surveillance for influenza, including follow-up in-hospital surveillance, should be considered part of routine public health surveillance. the KMoH considered verbal consent to be adequate. for children, verbal consent was obtained from guardians. overall 1.5% of all SARI and ILI patients reported having received influenza vaccination in the previous year. the majority of these patients (60%) were from Kakuma Refugee Camp (data not shown) the majority of these patients were from Kakuma Refugee Camp (data not shown) 0\u20133 days 14299(57.7) 10588(75.6) 0.001 4\u20137 days 8959(36.2) 3037(21.7) >7 days 1504(6.1) 388(2.8) Mean duration of illness (IQR) 3.0(2.0\u20135.0) 2.0(1.0\u20133.0) Underlying chronic illnesses a Any chronic illness. influenza-positive SARI cases ranged from a low of 7.2% in 2012 to a high of 12.0% in 2009, while the percentage of influenza-positive ILI cases ranged from a low of 8.1% in 2012 to a high of 18.2% in 2009. Of all influenza-positive SARI specimens, 77.1% were influenza A, 22.1% were influenza B,. 77.2% were influenza A, 20.7% were influenza B, and 2.1% were co-infections. most influenza-positive samples that were subtyped were either H3 (25.8% and 25.1% of SARI and ILI patients, respectively) in the six years of surveillance, influenza circulated nearly every month. aOR = 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1\u20132.0) was the only symptom more common in influenza-positive cases compared with influenza-negative cases. the percentage of influenza positivity varied by hospital (p0.001 for all three comparisons) Garissa PGH 733 65(8.9) 668(91.1) Kakuma 3,206 336(10.5) 2870(89.5) Dadaab 2,362 284(12.0) 2078(88.0) Nyanza PGH Length of illness before presenting to the hospital 0\u20133 days 12,996 1183(9.1) 11813(90.9) Ref Ref 4\u20137 days 8,031 707(8.8) 7324(91.2) 0.3\u20130.8) 0.004 0.5(0.3\u20130.9) 0.023 Chronic cough (Yes vs. No) 102 16(15.7) 86(84.3) 1.8(1.1\u20133.1) 0.032 1.7(0.9\u20133.1) 0.084 Active Tb (Yes vs. No) 53 1(1.9) 52(98.1) 0.2(0.0\u20131.4) 0.096 0.3(0.0\u20132.0) 0.202 Hospitalized in the last 12 months (Yes vs 8602(90.7) 1.0(0.9\u20131.1) 0.369 - Tachypnea (Yes vs. No)c 6,278 561(8.9) 5717(91.1) 0.9(0.8\u20131.0) 0.194 0.9(0.8\u20131.1) 0.215 Chest in-drawing 8,234 726(8.8) 7508(91.2) 1.0(0.9\u20131.1) 0.368 - Grunting (Yes vs. No a new tab a Adjusted for variables that were significant at p.2 in the bivariate analysis and data collection site; b Pearson chi-square; c Data not collected in Siaya DH and Tingwangi; Row percentages shown. stridor, nasal flaring, tachypnea, chest in-drawing and grunting were evaluated at the time of patient presentation to the hospital.
