{"summary": "organoids are a powerful new system and are being increasingly adopted for a wide range of studies. since 2009, over 3000 papers have been published that make use of organoids in some form or another. organoids can be derived either from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), adult-tissue-resident cells (stem or differentiated cells) or embryonic progenitors. a genuine organoid should satisfy several criteria: (1) a 3D structure containing cells that establish or retain the identity of the organ being modelled; (2) the presence of multiple cell types, as in the organ itself; (3) the tissue exhibit some aspect of the specialized function of the organ; and (4) self-organization according to the same intrinsic organizing principles as in the organ itself. in vitro models derived from stem cells allow for a broader array of tissue identities. differentiated organ cell types can be generated in vitro from pluripotent stem cells. cells derived from adult stem/progenitor cells can be used but historically these have proven difficult to expand in vitro. human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be induced to spontaneously undergo differentiative and morphogenetic behaviours that mimic the formation of embryonic germ layers. EBs form germ layers that express well-described molecular markers and even segregate to form patches of individual germ-layer tissue within the aggregate. by applying specific growth factors, these aggregates can be directed towards a specific germ layer. biologists have taken advantage of the knowledge on developmental events to construct or reconstruct a tissue in vitro (organoids) that recapitulates many of the key structural and functional features of the organ. the range of organoids established so far is rapidly increasing, and although in many cases these have been developed from rodent PSCs, researchers are translating experimental methods to human cells. a better understanding of the signalling pathways important for adult tissue maintenance and repair has enabled researchers to grow primary tissues as self-expanding organoids. intestinal organoids In the intestine, Wnt, Notch, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are required during tissue development and in adult homeostasis and repair. these conditions allow the long-term expansion of adult intestinal epithelium in culture while retaining its ability to differentiate into individual derivatives. the wells lab successfully differentiated PSCs into gut epithelium in vitro. these conditions result in the formation of spheroids after 2 days. de of transforming growth factor-beta signalling enabled the expansion of human gastric organoids from both pylorus and corpus epithelium that would contain all gland and pit cell types. only upon co-culture with the mesenchymal niche, corpus organoids from neonatal and adult could differentiate into this mature cell type. the authors demonstrate that their fundic organoids contain bona-fide stomach progenitors that can be isolated, cultured and further propagated in the tissue-derived organoid medium described by Barker, Huch and colleagues. this linking, for the first time, the development of both types of organoids. adult hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are the two endodermal-derived cell types in the adult liver. takebe et al. mixed human induced iPSC-derived hepatocytes with mesenchymal stem cells and umbilical cord cells. in 2015, Sampaziotis et al. also generated cholangiocyte organoids from iPSCs (Sampaziotis et al., 2015). altered protocols have enabled the establishment of liver models from different species from rat to dog. human disease models ranging from alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency to polycystic liver disease (Wills et al., 2016) to polycystic liver disease. Grapin-Botton established the first adult mouse pancreas organoid model by seeding pancreas ductal cells in Matrigel in the presence of FGF10, noggin, RSPO1 and EGF. a similar system was later applied to human pancreatic cancer cells (Boj et al., 2015) iPSCs differentiated to lung epithelium using air-liquid interphase culture. initial protocol was modified by the Spence lab to instruct cells towards a foregut fate by adding TGF/BMP inhibitors, FGF4 and Wnt activators. transferring these specified 3D spheroids into Matrigel and culturing them in FGF10-rich medium enabled the differentiation to lung organoids. alveoli consist of surfactant-secreting type II (AT2) and gas-exchanging type I (AT1) cells. single BASCs had bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation potential in lung organoids co-cultured with lung endothelial cells. only recently, two labs have been able to expand lung progenitors. the authors found that forced expression of thyroid-specific transcription factors in PSCs resulted in thyroid cells that formed follicles in vitro and upon transplantation. if self-renewing human thyroid organoids can be obtained from adult thyroid epithelium remains to be discovered. culture conditions that support intestinal organoids include embedding the intestinal stem cells in a 3D extracellular matrix (e.g. Matrigel) and culturing them in a medium supplemented with EGF, noggin and the Wnt agonist R-spondin (RSPO) these conditions allow the long-term expansion of adult intestinal epithelium in culture while retaining its ability to differentiate into individual derivatives. matrigel is essential for the formation of 3D foregut structures. these structures generate gastric organoids that contain all antral epithelium cells. blockade of transforming growth factor-beta signalling enabled the expansion of human gastric organoids. fundic organoids contain bona-fide stomach progenitors that can be isolated, cultured and further propagated in tissue-derived organoid medium. hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (also known as ductal cells) are the two endodermal-derived cell types in the adult liver. RSPO1 (Huch et al., 2013b), isolated liver cells self-organized into 3D structures that retained the ability to differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells. addition of an activator of cyclic adenosyl monophosphate (cAMP) signalling and inhibition of TGF signalling adapted this culture system to the expansion of adult human liver cells as self-renewing organoids that recapitulate some function of ex vivo liver tissue. combining both protocols could generate structures containing both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes or a better specification of true bi-potent hepatoblasts. altered protocols have enabled the establishment of liver models from different species from rat to dog. cultures can differentiate into more mature hepatocyte or cholangiocyte derivatives. both embryonic and/or adult pancreas cells are difficult to expand or maintain in culture. Grapin-Botton established the first adult mouse pancreas organoid model by seeding pancreas ductal cells in Matrigel. 'lung organoids' describe both upper- and lower-airway organoids. protocols for both PSC- and adult-tissue-derived organoids have been established. iPSCs were differentiated using air-liquid interphase culture. alveoli consist of surfactant-secreting type II (AT2) and gas-exchanging type I (AT1) cells. single BASCs had bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation potential in lung organoids co-cultured with lung endothelial cells. only recently, two labs have been able to expand lung progenitors. researchers found that forced expression of thyroid-specific transcription factors in PSCs resulted in thyroid cells that formed follicles in vitro and upon transplantation. this resulted in thyroid cells that formed follicles in vitro and upon transplantation. Xia et al. (2013) and Takasato et al. (2013) described conditions that would also give rise to the ureteric bud (UB) the cells then gave rise to UB precursors that could mature and integrate into embryonic mouse kidney. a heterogeneous population of bone progenitors can be induced to form small pieces of crystalline bone called microspicules. this requires 3D aggregation of the cells as well as the removal of serum and addition of TGF1. the method has many similarities to the Barker and Huch et al. stomach organoid method. morphological and transcriptomic changes recapitulated the changes in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle. these changes recapitulated the changes in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle. a decidua-like morphology similar to that seen in early pregnancy led to a decidua-like morphology similar to that seen in early pregnancy. a breakthrough came with the establishment of the entirely self-organizing 3D human renal organoids by Takasato et al. (2015). it involved minimal use of growth factors (just CHIR99021 to activate Wnt, and FGF9) and led to structures with all the major components of the developing kidney, including the collecting duct, proximal and distal tubules. endometrial organoids contain both ciliated and secretory cells. they respond to estradiol and progesterone in a manner reminiscent of the response of this tissue in vivo during the menstrual cycle. the embryonic ectoderm gives rise to two main tissue types: surface ectoderm. isolated mouse mammary epithelial cells were some of the first cells to be cultured in Matrigel. differences between mouse and human mammary stroma have made it difficult to translate these methodologies to a human in vitro model. mouse lineage-tracing studies suggest an ectodermal origin. ectodermal or endodermal. there is no direct evidence for this yet. optic cup organoids form the typical stratified architecture of the developing retina, including rods and cones. but generating functional photoreceptors, including light-sensitive outer segments, has been a challenge. the discovery in 2001 revealed the self-organization potential of neural progenitors to form neural-tube-like structures. progenitors generated neurons that properly migrated away from germinal zones to populate a more basal region reminiscent of the pre-plate of the cerebral cortex. this germinal zoning and segregation of post-mitotic neurons is highly reminiscent of the developing human brain. these initial cultures used dual SMAD and Wnt inhibition to promote the formation of relatively pure neural identities. internalized brain organoids fused regionalized brain organoids. internal telencephalic region could migrate to dorsal cortical tissue as they do in vivo. inner-ear organoids develop from non-neural ectoderm. isolated mouse mammary epithelial cells were some of the first cells to be cultured in Matrigel. differences between mouse and human mammary stroma have made it difficult to translate these methodologies to a human in vitro model. mouse lineage-tracing studies suggest an ectodermal origin. ectodermal or endodermal. there is no direct evidence for this yet. morphology of retinal primordium, the optic cup, could be adopted. these optic-cup-like organoids begin as aggregates containing large spherical vesicles of neuroepithelium with an early retinal identity. as development proceeds, these vesicles spontaneously invaginate to from a cup-like morphology. germinal zones and segregation of post-mitotic neurons are highly reminiscent of the developing human brain. these initial cultures used dual SMAD and Wnt inhibition to promote the formation of relatively pure neural identities. however, in the absence of these inhibitors, simply providing a very minimal medium to prevent the expansion of non-neuroectodermal identities could generate a more broad brain regional identity. researchers fused regionalized brain organoids, revealing that interneurons generated within the ventral telencephalic region could indeed migrate to dorsal cortical tissue as they do in vivo. extended culture of cerebral organoids resulted in neuron maturation within the organoid, allowing for the formation of rudimentary networks and even rare responses to light in these whole-brain organoids. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. iPSCs from CF patients differentiated into liver cholangiocytes can also model CF in vitro. cerebral organoids were applied to the study of primary microcephaly, a genetic condition caused by a mutation in CDK5RAP2. the patient neural stem cells began dividing asymmetrically and generating neurons too early, which led to a depletion of the progenitor pool and an eventual decrease in overall neuron number. parfitt et al. (2016) generated retinal organoids from iPSCs with a mutation in CEP290, a known genetic cause of this condition. these organoids showed normal initial development into optic cups, but the resulting tissues showed decreased ciliation and reduced cilia lengths. the authors were able to rescue the cilia length and protein trafficking in the cilium. the use of organoids to model cancer in vitro has become of great interest to the cancer field. organoids derived from tissue resections, biopsies or even circulating tumour cells have now been established. in all cases, cancer-derived organoids more faithfully maintain the genetic features of the tumour of origin. organoids from many tissues, from liver to oesophageal, have proven suitable for large drug-screening tests. it would be even more informative to investigate their predictive value in correlating drug-sensitivity data with clinical or genomic data. up to today, only two studies, one in colon and the other in bladder, have demonstrated the potential of organoids. cerebral organoids that model genetic microcephaly were recently adapted by a number of research groups to study the mechanisms of microcephaly caused by Zika-virus infection. initial observations of the effect of Zika on brain organoids were described as soon as 3 months after the world health organization declared Zika a global health emergency in 2016. genetic-engineering tool compared to TALEN or zinc-finger nuclease technologies has prompted many investigators to adapt it to almost any cell type in any organism. the Clevers lab pioneered the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to organoid cultures and used it to correct mutations and restore the chloride channel function of CF-patient-derived intestinal organoids. gene editing in colon organoids has enabled the step-wise recapitulation of tumorigenesis some organoids have been implanted into highly angiogenic sites in rodents. this approach has even revealed that certain human-specific bi-products, for example liver metabolites, are detectable in the rodent host blood. this approach has the potential to overcome tissue growth/survival limitations while maintaining in vitro accessibility and scalability. organoids have proven amenable for drug testing with relatively small catalogues of drug compounds. a number of new methods have recently been introduced to address this issue. however, in the more immediate term, organoids could be combined in the already established arsenal of 2D and bioengineered disease models. human in vitro liver models allow for initial testing before testing in patients. a long-term goal of organoid technologies will be to apply them to cell replacement or whole-organ transplantation. the first human condition to be modelled in organoids was cystic fibrosis (CF), in the intestinal organoid system. liver organoids from patients with A1AT deficiency recapitulated epithelial features of the disease. failure to develop mature biliary cells in liver organoids from an Alagille syndrome patient mirrored the biliary defects observed in patients. a genetic condition causing lissencephaly (smooth brain) was modelled using forebrain organoids. they showed defects in progenitors, including mitosis timing, spindle orientation, and defective Wnt signalling. the resulting tissues showed decreased ciliation and reduced cilia lengths. alley et al., 1988, have enabled the identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity. but they have certain drawbacks: they lack the tissue architecture of the organ in question. they are not applicable to all cancer models, are expensive and impractical for large drug screenings. organoids from many tissues, from the ones listed above to liver and oesophageal, have proven suitable for large drug-screening tests. up to today, only two studies have demonstrated the potential of organoids for predicting patient response. Cryptosporidium has been shown to infect and complete its life cycle in intestinal and lung organoids. the ability to use human intestinal organoids to propagate coronaviruses in vitro has enabled the identification of the small intestine as an alternative infection route for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. gastric organoids have been used to develop models of Helicobacter pylori infection. the rapidity with which a completely new disease model has been established speaks to the power and future potential of these in vitro models for a variety of disorders. cancer organoids Since the first report that HeLa cells could be grown in vitro, researchers have established cancer cell lines for the majority of tumour types that have facilitated seminal discoveries in cancer biology. organoids derived from tissue resections, biopsies or even circulating tumour cells have now been established. in all cases, cancer-derived organoids more faithfully maintain the genetic and phenotypic features of the tumour of origin. they are amenable for drug screening as well as drug development. organoids have proven a good model to study infectious diseases and the mechanisms behind human-specific infectious agents. human small-intestinal organoids have been used to model norovirus (HuNoV) infection and propagation. Cryptosporidium has been shown to infect and complete its life cycle in intestinal and lung organoids. initial observations of the effect of Zika on brain organoids were described as soon as 3 months after the world health organization declared Zika a global health emergency in 2016. these initial reports described overall smaller sizes of infected organoids, consistent with the microcephaly seen in patients, and a specific effect on neural progenitors. more recently, these brain organoids have been used by at least five independent groups to test treatment strategies that would prevent the effects of Zika infection on neural progenitors. gene editing in colon organoids has enabled the step-wise recapitulation of tumorigenesis in vitro (Drost et al., 2015; Matano et al., 2015), the identification of cancer signatures in microsatellite-unstable tumours (Artegiani et al., 2019) or even the development of the first human brain organoid cancer model for primitive neuroectodermal tumours (Bian et al., 2018) organoids transplanted into highly angiogenic site of the rodent brain could be vascularized to improve survival and attract host-derived microglia. this vascularization approach has the potential to overcome tissue growth/survival limitations while maintaining in vitro accessibility and scalability. a number of new methods have recently been introduced to address this issue. organoids have proven amenable for drug testing with relatively small catalogues of drug compounds. more large-scale drug testing to identify novel compounds may require scaling up of organoids. however, in the more immediate term, organoids could be combined in the already established arsenal of 2D and bioengineered disease models. a source of functioning cells or tissues could replace the faulty ones in a patient would be a major advance. vast improvements on the technology are still required to achieve this goal."}
