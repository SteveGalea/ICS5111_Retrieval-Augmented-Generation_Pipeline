{"summary": "the Model We treat pathogen dissemination as a stochastic sequence of discrete encounters between incident patients (P) who are either infectious or noninfectious, a caregiver (C) and the environment (fomites), each of which can be contaminated or uncontaminated. a contaminated caregiver can, in turn, contaminate subsequent patients. the model does not incorporate patient-patient transmission by contaminated patients. an infectious patient can also contaminate the 4 patients surrounding him or her in the clinic queue (2 preceding and 2 following patients) the screening instrument could comprise a symptom inventory, knowledge of recent travel, household exposure, membership in a known high-risk group, or a combination of these or other elements. the postulated instrument has a defined sensitivity and specificity; values can be combined with the population prevalence of infectious patients to determine how many patients deemed at high risk or low risk are actually contagious. patient positive 0 PPC = 0.2 PPE = 0.2 P(hand hygiene) = 0.5 PCE = 0 Environment positive PEP = 0.2 PEC = 0.2 P(environ decont) = 0 Temporally adjacent patient positive PPP = 0 \u2013 \u2013 *PPC, probability of transmission from patient to caregiver; PEP, probability of transmission from patient to patient; PPP, probability of transmission from patient to patient. fectious high-risk population Maximum (%) Minimum (%) Minimum (%) 5 \u20132.1 \u20131 1 0.27 10 \u20134 \u20131.8 1.6 1.1 20 \u20136.8 \u20132.7 3.6 0 40 \u201310.7 \u20134.4 5.7 1 Figure 2. risk that an uncontaminated patient will become contaminated during his or her clinic visit. temporary segregation adds a system-based layer of protection to such behavior-based interventions, providing an additional barrier to pathogen dissemination. mathematical models could help guide the allocation of resources required to support system-based infection-control measures."}
