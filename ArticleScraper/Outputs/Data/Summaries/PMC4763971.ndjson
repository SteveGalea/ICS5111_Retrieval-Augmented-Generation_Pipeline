{"summary": "introns, viroids, viral (RNA and DNA viruses, bacteriophages, retrotransposons, Long Terminal Repeats) networks cooperate within cellular genomes as modular. non-coding RNAs have built complementary consortia, such as rRNAs, tRNAs, spliceosomes, editosomes, and other ribonucleoprotein particles. retroviruses have RNA as genetic material, that may be a single-stranded RNA or a double stranded RNA. retroviruses may exploit the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for replication of their genomes. reverse transcriptase produces viral DNA which can be integrated into the host DNA under its integrase function. retrotransposons, LTRs, retrotranscriptases long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) and endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) encode reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins in vertebrates. LINE-1s (L1s) accounts for about 17% of human DNA while HERVs account for about 8%. retroelements mobilize throughout the genomes by a copy-and-paste process involving RNA intermediates. they have the potential to modify mammalian genomes not only through insertional mutagenesis but generating many other novelties that alter genomes both structurally and functionally. retroelements may have provided some beneficial genomic functions with potential evolutionary advantages. RT inhibition restores the 'normal' small RNA profile and the regulatory networks that depend on them. the retrotransposon-encoded RT drives a previously unrecognized mechanism crucial to the transformed state. the pre-miRNA hairpin structure is then exported into the cytoplasm via exportin-5. in the cytoplasm it assembles in RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) it includes Dicer ribonucleases that cleave pre-miRNAs into mature single strand sRNAs. single-molecule RNA structure was tagged, i.e. multiple sites were chemically modified are identified by massively parallel sequencing of single RNA strands. RING-MaP analysis of single-molecule nucleic acid structure enabled a novel view of the global architecture. the molecular evolution of MS2 from low- to high-affinity hairpins was analysed. quantitative analysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) provided an insight into the biophysics of RNAs and on consequences of sequence-function relationships. conserved nucleotide positions in influenza A have been described as partially complementary and capable of interacting in cis within each segment of RNA, forming structures called panhandles. importin 7 and importin have been shown to enhance nuclear entry of HIV-1 (but not HIV-2) correlating with its ability to bind to the viral integrase and the virus accessory protein Vpr. RNA cap methylases are cellular factors that regulate post transcriptional HIV-1 RNA expression in order to produce a viral mRNA camouflaged by cellular mRNA showing a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap. 1.6. RNA Silencing and Host-virus Interaction Plants and lower eukaryotes produce miRNAs and siRNAs as a form of RNA-interference (RNAi) to restrict viruses. virally encoded oncoproteins such as adenovirus E1A and human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 can inhibit small interfering RNA and microRNA biogenesis. adenovirus VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit small interfering RNA and microRNA biogenesis, both by inhibiting nuclear export of shRNA or pre-miRNA precursors. the high-level production of leRNAs may imply a role in the regulation of the switch from viral mRNA transcription to genomic RNA synthesis. it is generally believed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses do not encode miRNAs, owing to inaccessible cellular miRNA processing machinery. vsRNA1 overexpression inhibited viral translation and IRES activity in infected cells. hiv1-miRH3 is a hairpin structure of 50 nucleotides found at the 5' end of the HIV viral mRNA. the TAR element is a hairpin structure of 50 nucleotides found at the 5' end of the HIV viral mRNA. a small portion of the viRNAs, with negative polarity, is encoded within the 3\u2032-UTR. viral interactions with cellular miRNAs have been identified. one of the first host miRNAs shown to block retrovirus was miR-32. inhibition of influenza virus replication has been described for four miRNAs. miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-149, miR-324-5p, and miR-378) were found to target sequences, two of them located in the viral nef gene, of the HIV-1 genome. recently inhibition of HIV-1 infection by miR-29a and miR-29b was confirmed. however, HIV-1 is protected by a complex RNA secondary structure surrounding the target site. the role of type I-IFNs in increasing host susceptibility could be explained by modulation of components of the immune response involved in controlling the growth of infective agents. the mechanism by which viruses survive inside cells is by inactivating the cellular antiviral machinery, or inactivating the RNA interference response, acting on the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) TIA1, TIAR, Caprin1, USP10, DDX6 (Rck/p54), DDX3 helicase, poly-A binding protein PAPB and Lsm1 also contain enzymes of the RNA silencing pathway. different viruses exploit the binding to protein scaffolds to avoid SG formation or to assemble their RNA into SGs devoid of cellular RNA. nucleoprotein (NP) inhibits SG formation through eIF independent mechanisms. host-shutoff protein polymerase-acidic protein-X (PA-X) is essential to block SG formation. viral accessory protein Vpr is a component of the PIC. Vpr is a paralogue of primate lentiviruses that enables viruses to infect monocyte-derived cells. it is a component of the reverse transcription complex (RTC) and co-localizes with the viral nucleic acid and integrase within purified HIV-1 RTCs. sylase 2 (UNG2) (78) and single strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1) have been shown dependent on Vpr. a premature activation of the SLX4 complex has been shown dependent on Vpr. a premature activation of the SLX4 complex has been shown dependent on Vpr. viral proteins can interact and modulate their activity. viruses develop the ability to interact and deactivate these defences. many viruses enter inside the cells are able to derail the cellular machinery, including the epigenetic control. hNAP-1 acts with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes to facilitate transcription. in the HIV-1 LTR, it is thought that the LSF protein binds at position 10 to +27 of the LTR.

RT inhibition restores the 'normal' small RNA profile and the regulatory networks that depend on them. protein complexes containing endoribonucleases cleave pre-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs. the pre-miRNA hairpin structure is then exported into the cytoplasm via exportin-5. miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of mammalian genes. single-molecule RNA structure was tagged, i.e. multiple sites were chemically modified are identified by massively parallel sequencing of single RNA strands.
