{"summary": "bioaerosols are present virtually anywhere in the environment, and their exposure is shown to cause numerous adverse health effects [1]\u2013[2]. a number of studies demonstrated that the respiratory tract can be colonized with disease organisms [3]\u2013[5] through talking, coughing, sneezing or singing, the potential virulent organisms can be exhaled and spread into the ambient environment [6]. EBC has demonstrated great potential and advantages in early disease screening and diagnosis [31], opening a new arena for studying airway inflammation and chemistry [32]. a variety of devices (Table S1, Supporting Information) were developed including Rtube collection system (Respiratory Research, Inc, Charlottesville, VA) and EcoScreen\u00ae condenser (Erich Jaeger Gmbh, Wurzbur, Germany). method showed detection rates of 7% and 46.8% for the RTube and the throat swab method, respectively [20]. condenser coatings [34], sampling temperature [35] and sampling times [36] were shown to affect physical collection efficiencies of available EBC collectors. a novel method was developed using hydrophobic surface, a layer of ice, and a droplet scavenging procedure. the dimensions of the collection device are measured as 804040 (mm) (lengthwidthheight) in the collection device cover, there is a hole with a diameter of 6 mm as the exhaled breath inlet. the thickness of the collection device cover and base was about 3 mm, and the whole collection device weighs around 105 g. exhaled breath condenses into tiny liquid droplets on the hydrophobic surface. assuming an average breathing rate of 12 L/min for an adult, the particle speed from the exhaled breath would be around 10 m/s given the size of the straw (5 mm in diameter) the method developed here also rely on the impaction to collect the bacterial and viral particles. six student volunteers were recruited to exhale through the device for 1, 2, 3 and 4 min. the volume of collected EBC was measured by a calibrated pipette. the amount of EBC per unit time collected by the device was determined using averages of samples obtained by the volunteers under each of specific collection time tested. species were identified using VITEK\u00ae 2 (BioM\u00e9rieux, Inc, 100 Rodolphe Street, Durham, NC) molecular detection of bacteria and virus using qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively, were performed according to the procedures described in Supporting Information S1. sterile water (DNA and RNA free) was first added into the collection base of the device up to a depth of 5 mm. a disposable sterile straw with a diameter of 5 mm (16 cm long) is inserted through the exhaled breath inlet. the human subjects are then advised to mouth-breathe without wearing a nose clip through the exhaled breath inlet. the method developed here rely on the impaction to collect the bacterial and viral particles in the exhaled breath. about 10 l of DNA and RNA free DI water was pipetted onto the hydrophobic film. the bacterial or viral particles in the exhaled breath usually come with water droplets. breath through mouth-breathing were measured in a particle free bio-safety hood using an Optical Particle Counter (OPC) at a flow rate of 1.2 L/min. the OPC was connected to a two-way tubing, which connects to clean air (Biological SafetyHood) and the breathing straw, respectively. a novel collection method and device was developed and evaluated in collecting EBC samples from human subjects using culturing and molecular methods. the device itself costs less than $10, with about $0.5 for consumables (straw and hydrophobic film) per collection. d cytokine analysis suggests that the device developed in this study can provide adequate amount of EBC sample for rapid analysis. in the future different hydrophobic materials should be explored to improve the overall efficiency of the exhaled breath condensate collection device. bacterial size ranges (0.65\u20132.2 m), a concentration level of 329 to 25819 particles/L was observed. for larger particles of 2.2\u20134 m a concentration level of 60 to 400 particles/L was obtained. particle size distribution trend in exhaled breath was also found using the OPC. bacterial species Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria rosea were detected using Vitek2 in six EBC samples. a distinct indoor air signature of bacteria was demonstrated to be associated with human skin, hair, and nostrils. bacterial species were not identified in our study because of limitation of Vitek 2. yogranulomatous bronchopneumonia, were detected in the exhaled air from foals in a recent study. bacterial aerosol concentrations detected in exhaled breath condensate samples collected using the device from seven human subjects. bacterial samples were successfully amplified (Ct values were 16\u201319), while positive samples (B. subtilis) had a Ct value of 15 and negative control had a value of 28. more than 60% of bacterial particles of below 1 m could be exhaled out. results suggest that exhaled breath is an important source of bacterial aerosols in the built environments. Xylosus were identified in EBC samples from patients with respiratory symptoms using VITEK 2 system. qPCR was also applied to detecting influenza A H3N2 viruses in EBC samples collected by the device. spiking viruses into the samples in general enhanced the overall qPCR signal. exhaled breath holds great promise for monitoring human health. but analysis challenges remain due to complex matrix of the breath. a simple and low cost collection method was developed here for collecting bacteria and virus particles. experimental procedures used in this study include physical characterization and molecular analysis of the EBC collection efficiencies of the device and its pilot application in a respiratory clinic."}
