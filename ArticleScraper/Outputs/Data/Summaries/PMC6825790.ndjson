{"summary": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of the family paramyxoviridae. it is a member of the genus Avulavirus within the family. Newcastle disease (ND) is a disease of poultry that affecting the alimentary and respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system. exposure to humans results in mild conjunctivitis, laryngitis and influenza-like symptoms. virotherapy involves the treatment of cancer by using a virus specifically to infect cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. the effects of six Malaysian strains of NDV have been studied on several tumor cell lines. the goal of most cancer therapy is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation. ration Assay To confirm anti-proliferative effects of NDV on DBTRG.05MG cells, MTT cell proliferation assay was carried out. each sample was assayed in triplicate, and control samples include cells without NDV. DBTRG.05MG cells were seeded in 6-well plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5%CO2 atmosphere. twenty-four hours later, the medium in each well was removed and replaced with NDV at IC50 concentration dissolved in the culture medium. each experiment was assayed three times (n=3) DBTRG.05MG brain tumor cells were treated with NDV at IC50 concentration and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h at 37\u00b0C. the cultured cells were harvested using trypsin and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm. the pellets were fixed in 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. x 106 cells/ml were seeded into six-well plate in 2 ml culture medium. some wells were left without virus to be used as a control. some wells were left without virus to be used as a control. samples were placed in 12 x 75 Falcon tubes. each experiment was assayed three times (n = 3) Statistical analysis Data was expressed as mean SEM. titer were treated the cells and were prepared together with control. each sample was assayed in triplicate. the cells were treated for 24, 48, and 72 hours. DBTRG.05MG cells were seeded in 6-well plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5%CO2 atmosphere. twenty-four hours later, the medium in each well was removed and replaced with NDV at IC50 concentration dissolved in the culture medium. cultured cells were harvested using trypsin and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm. pellets were fixed in 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. pellets were blocked in serum which was later fixed in glutaraldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells were spun down at 1,000 (rpm) for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with PBS twice. DNA extraction was carried out according to protocol of a kit for blood and cultured cells. each experiment was assayed three times (n = 3). Statistical analysis Data was expressed as mean SEM. differences were considered significant at P0.05. untreated cells treated with IC25 value of NDV AF2240 titer (132 and 460 HAU/ml) cells treated with IC50 value of NDV AF2240 titer (460 HAU/ml) cells were treated with the IC50 value of the virus after 72 hours. cells in culture lost contact with adjacent cells, and cell membrane blebbing. morphological changes including rounding up of nuclei and shrinkage occurred. RG.05MG cells treated with NDV AF2240 (IC50, 460 HAU/ml) after 72 hours. apoptotic cells are green with condensed chromatin (C) nuclear fragmentation (F) and cell membrane blebbing (arrow). cell death via apoptosis increased significantly (P 0.05) in a time-dependent manner. lines showed ultrastructural changes after being treated with NDV strain AF2240 for 24, 48 and 72 h. early stage of apoptosis was observed at 24 hours post-inoculation. cells broke up into discrete fragments to form apoptotic bodies. at 72 hours post-inoculation secondary necrosis was observed. the DNA of DBTRG.05MG cells treated for 24, 48 and 72 hours with NDV strain AF2240 were extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. the inoculation of NDV strain AF2240 on DBTRG.05MG cells at 24, 48 and 72 hours did not show any DNA laddering pattern on the gel. 240 was 18.40% and 37.40% for 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation. this virus-induced cell cycle perturbation concurred with the results of the microscopic assays. phase contrast microscopy was used to observe the cells changing within its media after inoculation of NDV to determine apoptotic features. morphological features of apoptosis such as cell shrinking, cell membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation were observed by using phase contrast microscopy. AO is a membrane-permeable cationic dye that binds to nucleic acids of viable cells. PI is impermeable to intact membranes, but readily penetrates the membranes of nonviable cells and binds to DNA or RNA, causing orange fluorescence. apoptosis has been characterized biochemically by the production of 180-200 bp internucleosomal DNA fragments resulting from the activation of an endonuclease. apoptosis has been characterized biochemically by the production of 180-200 bp internucleosomal DNA fragments resulting from the activation of an endonuclease. AF2240 did not stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in cell line. the problem with the ladder assay is its low sensitivity. apoptosis can occur fully in the absence of DNA fragmentation. untreated and treated brain cells were evaluated for apoptosis. NDV strain AF2240 caused an increasing in the subG1 region. apoptotic cells showed an increased up-take of the vital dye compared to live cells."}
