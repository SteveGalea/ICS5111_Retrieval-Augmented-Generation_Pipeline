{"summary": "augmented immunity is mediated by the exacerbation of immune memory. the word vaccine itself is derived from vacca (Latin for cow) there are in excess of fifty licensed vaccines, half of which are in common use. despite such outrageous and egregious success, many major issues persist. no licensed vaccines exist for HIV and malaria, two of the world's three big global killers. there are no realistic hopes for such vaccines appearing in the short to medium term. hepatitis B vaccine is an antigen - or subunit \u2013 based vaccine. many epitope-based vaccines have now entered clinical trials. but they are yet to fulfil their potential, medically or commercially. immunogenicity is the most important and interesting property for vaccine design and discovery. it is this property that allows a molecular moiety to induce a significant immune response. the term antigen and immunogen shall be restricted to a single meaning; that of a protein, specifically one from a pathogenic microorganism, that evokes a measurable immune response. reverse vaccinology is becoming a discernibly more prevalent means of identifying subunit vaccines. the contribution made by computation to the practice of reverse vaccinology is becoming ever more significant and ever more obvious [7]. it is often so much more complex, confusing, and confounding. 570 proteins were identified, 350 expressed in vitro, and 85 were surface exposed. potential ORFs in N. meningitidis genome were identified [11][12]. bioinformatics support for preclinical vaccine discovery has yet to be found. there are two main forms of support for vaccine discovery provided by bioinformatics. the first is technically indistinguishable from support for more general target discovery. the other type of support is focused on immunoinformatics: it addresses problems such as the accurate prediction of epitopes. IEDB is the dominant force in current immunoinformatics and stands as one of the principal achievements of the field. the number and quality of epitopes within it are an enormous improvement. the existence of these longmer epitopes has greatly expanded the repertoire of peptides open to inspection by T-cells [30][31][32][33]. the number of possible sequences that a nonameric peptide might possess is in the region of 512 billion. peptides with those from intact antigen and whole antigen-antibody complexes are similar. peptides in intact antigen and in whole antigen-antibody complexes are similar. this may be that the preformed antibody recognizes denatured antigen in vivo or that the isolated peptide adopts a conformation able to mimic a discontinuous epitope. antigens are not epitopes, and epitopes are not antigens. despite the obvious caveats inherent in this strategy, this has become a favoured approach taken by many when tasked with selecting vaccine candidates. a common schema reduces eukaryotic cells to 4 compartments (cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear) and prokaryotic to 3 compartments (cytoplasmic, extracellular, and periplasmic) a common schema reduces eukaryotic cells to 4 compartments (cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear) and prokaryotic to 3 compartments (cytoplasmic, extracellular, and periplasmic) many programs and servers have been developed able to predict subcellular location of gene products and proteins. iPSORT deals specifically with secreted, mitochondrial, and chloroplast locations. a set of Bayesian networks were able to make individual predictions for specific subcellular locations. a parallel implementation with a confidence level-based decision engine and two serial implementations with a hierarchical decision structure were implemented. the parallel pipeline outperformed the serial pipeline, but took twice as long to execute. identifying antigens in newly sequenced microbial genomes is through similarity searching. this process presupposes that enough known antigens are available so such searches can be comprehensive and thus effective. this process presupposes that enough known antigens are available so such searches can be comprehensive and thus effective. EPIMHC [70] is a relational database of naturally occurring MHC-binding peptides and T-cell epitopes. it contains over 2,500 entries for linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes. antiJen holds over 3,500 entries for linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes. IEDB has largely eclipsed other efforts in functional immune databases. but it does not address antigenicity at the whole protein level. a protective antigen is a protein which is recognised and recalled by the host. a protective antigen is a protein which is recognised and recalled by the host. antigenic protein is the so-called virulence factor (VF) these proteins are able to undertake the colonization of a host organism and/or induce disease. they are the front-line weapons in the pathogenic arsenal. a number of databases that archive VFs have been reported. Candida albicans virulence factor (CandiVF) is a species-specific database that contains VFs. it may be searched using BLAST or a HLA-DR hotspot prediction server. antigens need not be VFs, they need only be accessible to immune surveillance and need not be directly involved in infectivity. thresholds are family dependent, as well as problem dependent. some consider this to be the prime factor determining the potential immunogenicity of a protein. the likelihood that a protein is immunogenic is solely a function of that protein\u2019s dissimilarity to the whole host proteome at the sequence level. a peptide of say 10 amino acids, even one mismatch in an otherwise perfect match can be significant. the cross-reactivity of a single high-affinity monoclonal antibody is rather different in nature to the cross-reactivity of large set of less affine polyclonal antibodies. we have identified sets of 100 known antigenic and non-antigenic protein sequences. they were compared to the human and mouse genomes using standard sequence similarity searching protocols. this implies a lack of clear homologues between pathogens and the human or mouse proteomes. these proteins comprised heat shock proteins, catalases, enzymes involved in hydrolysis. a variant based on fragments may be more successful, and this is clearly an issue crying out for further, deeper research. a variant based on fragments may be more successful, and this is clearly an issue crying out for further, deeper research. approach seeks to discriminate between candidate vaccines and nonantigens. approach uses alignment-free sequence representation to derive statistical models. ACC transformation accounts for neighbour effects, i.e. lack of independence. ACC pre-processing was applied to sets of known bacterial, viral and tumour antigens. models had prediction accuracies in the 70% to 89% range. for the parasite and fungal antigens, models had prediction accuracies in the 70% to 89% range. the task of predicting whole protein immunogenicity is probably several orders of magnitude more complex and demanding than say predicting binding of peptides to an MHC or even of predicting binding of a pMHC complex to a TCR. this is not to say that such complex prediction exercises are themselves subsumed in the task of predicting immunogencity at the system level. pathogen-side properties are properties intrinsic to the pathogen as a whole organism. they include the state of aggregation exhibited by a candidate vaccine and any post-translational danger signals that the protein might possess. identifying and predicting this diverse tranche of properties is a problem and thus a challenge unto itself. NERVE is an expert system for vaccine antigen discovery. it addresses some of the issues of prioritisation discussed above. the program has been developed to help automate reverse vaccinology. many host- derived molecules are also labelled PAMPs. they include fibronectin, heparan sulphate, and heparan sulphate. these molecules are endogenous activators of innate immunity. they may figure in auto-immune scenarios. a candidate vaccine should be highly expressed, available for immune surveillance, and possess epitopes that the host recognises. a candidate vaccine should be highly expressed, available for immune surveillance, and possess epitopes that the host recognises. a candidate vaccine should be highly expressed, available for immune surveillance and the possession of post-translational danger signals. authors declare no competing financial interests.
