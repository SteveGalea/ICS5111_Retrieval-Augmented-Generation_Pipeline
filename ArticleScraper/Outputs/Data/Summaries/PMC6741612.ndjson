{"summary": "IFN- forms the type III IFN family, which is composed of three members, IFN-1, IFN-2 and IFN-3, also named IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B. it is expressed in a small fraction of the human population as a consequence of a frameshift occurring in a coding sequence, upstream of the IFNL3 gene. type III IFNs trigger the same Jak-STAT signal transduction pathway. some ISGs encode factors that participate in the IFN signal transduction pathway. kinases promote the activation of the NF-B, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. some ISG products participate themselves in the signaling pathways leading to IFN production and IFN responses thus creating positive feedback loops. a major question that arose after the discovery of IFN- was whether type I and type III IFN responses were redundant in vivo. tis virus i.p.

Lungs Influenza A SC35M-NS1 14 Influenza A PR8-NS IFNLR1 deficiency did not substantially affect HSV-2 replication. in contrast, IFNAR1 deficiency strongly increased HSV-2 replication. additional studies showed no protective effect of IFN- against infection with encephalomyocarditis virus. IFN- was shown to play a major, nonredundant role in the protection against rotavirus infection. IL-28R0/0, and double-knockout mice were highly susceptible to oral rotavirus infection, while IFNAR0/0 and wild-type mice were resistant. mouse and human IFN- are not species specific and can bind receptors of both species. IFN- responses correlated with IL-28R expression. keratinocytes and vaginal epithelial cells responded to IFN-. IFN--responsive cells differed from IFN--responsive cells. cells forming the convoluted tubules in the kidney and the epithelial cells of the chorod plexus in the brain. circulating IFN- induced a widespread response, which was pronounced in endothelial cells. ytes 67 Neurons 67 pDCs 24 DCs 25 Monocytes 62 In vivo Liver 53, 54 Nonresponsive cells (human and mouse) Cell lines Fibroblasts 5 Primary cells Lymphocytes 12, 26 Monocytes, macrophages 5, 12, 62 Endothelial cells 62 Fibroblasts 12 Adipocytes 62 Splenocytes 5 In vivo Adipocytes 19 Endothelial cells 19 Hepatocytes ( plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) express IFNLR1 [22, 23] and IFN- was shown to alter their stimulatory properties. no expression was detected in natural killer and T cells [22] human but not mouse hepatocytes respond to IFN- in chimeric mice treated with IFN-. IFN- responses were limited to cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells forming the bile ducts. IFN--responsive cells strikingly differed from IFN--responsive cells. after IFN- expression, Mx1-positive cells almost exclusively corresponded to epithelial cells. circulating IFN- induced a widespread response, which was pronounced in endothelial cells and included most cell types. killer cells 62 Airway epithelial cells 65 Nasal epithelial cells 66 Astrocytes 67 Neurons 67 pDCs 24 DCs 25 Monocytes 62 In vivo Liver 53, 54 Nonresponsive cells (human and mouse) Cell lines Fibroblasts 5 Primary cells Lymphocytes 12, 26 Monocytes, macrophages 5, 12, 62 Endothelial cells 62 Fibroblasts 12 Adipocytes 62 Splenocytes conventional (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) express IFNLR1 [22, 23] and IFN- was shown to alter their stimulatory properties. no expression was detected in natural killer and T cells [22] IFN--Producing Cells are produced after recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors. these receptors include the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytoplasmic RNA helicases, such as RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, and cytoplasmic DNA sensors. expression of IFN- has been reported in DCs, respiratory epithelial cells, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, primary neuronal cells and a variety of cell lines. expression of IFN- has been reported in type I IFNs, pDCs and more particularly pDCs. IFN- was the major IFN type induced by rhinovirus or influenza A virus infection of primary human airway epithelial cells [34, 45, 46] in mice, IFN- production was observed in mouse tracheal epithelial cells in response to influenza A virus infection or poly(I:C) treatment. Interestingly, type I IFNs were only detected at very low levels in these cells. pDCs produced large amounts of IFN- after treatment with poly(I:C) or coculture with HCV-infected cells. pDCs and cDCs produce IFN- but not IFN- after stimulation by HCV-infected cells. type I IFNs were only detected at very low levels in these cells. IFN- expression was induced in response to experimental HCV infection of human fetal liver cells or in patients with chronic HCV infection. treatment with IFN- prior to virus infection increased IFN- expression. same results were obtained when IFN-treated macrophages were stimulated. virus-induced expression of IFN- is thus expected to be lower than in wild-type mice. in the first case, very few cells in the splenocyte population are expected to respond to IFN- and therefore to modulate type I IFN expression. in the second case, epithelial cells such as airway epithelial cells are likely poor IFN- producers. cross talk exists between the type I and type III IFN systems. the milder side effects of IFN- were confirmed in a phase 2 study. no significant hematological toxicity was detected. genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms. the mechanism by which IFN-3 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of HCV clearance remains to be determined. the mechanism by which IFN-3 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of HCV clearance remains to be determined. a novel transcript located 3 kb upstream of IFNL3 was identified as IFNL4[3]. ss469415590 is a dinucleotide variant (TTG) where G results from the deletion of one T nucleotide (rs67272382) and from a TG substitution (rs74597329) paradoxically, the expression of this additional IFN- subtype is associated with impaired clearance of HCV. the IFN- system thus likely evolved to offer a local protection that fits epithelium-rich anatomical structures. protection of epithelial surfaces may also be instrumental in limiting virus transmission by feco-oral or aerosol transmission. by acting mostly on epithelial cells, IFN- would act in a rather radial way from the infection focus. new subtype, IFN-4, implicated in impaired clearance of HCV in patients which express the gene. understanding mechanisms of such variations in the responsiveness to treatment will help to improve therapies."}
