{"summary": "a 32-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital on march 29, 2003. she had myalgia for 1 week and fever, chills, and rigor for 2 days. on admission, her temperature was 38.8\u00b0C. a generalized convulsion with a positive RT-PCR for the SARS-CoV was positive. she had no neck rigidity and up-rolling eyeballs lasting for 1 minute. she had no residual neurologic deficit. -CoV in the CSF suggests possible infection of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV. other possible causes of convulsion were considered. the patient was monitored closely in the intensive care unit. RT-PCR and Southern hybridization on human brain autopsy samples provided more definitive experimental evidence for the neurotropism and neuroinvasion of HCoV and its possible association with multiple sclerosis. the findings from our patient are not compatible with multiple sclerosis. the presence of SARS-CoV in the CNS cannot be firmly established. positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV in stool specimens suggests involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. our case demonstrates that SARS-CoV can possibly infect multiple organ systems."}
