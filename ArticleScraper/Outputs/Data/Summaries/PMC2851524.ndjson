{"summary": "simulated patient appeared for treatment at a hospital emergency department. standardized history included a 72-hour period of high fever, cough, shortness of breath, and severe malaise. each site had at least 3 trained infection control observers available. a principal investigator (A.S.) was present at each simulation to ensure standardization. Observer 1 follows the patient through all clinical areas, including transit between areas. Observer 3 monitors cleaning of clinical areas after use. a \u201cPPE set\u201d was defined as the appropriate combination of PPE items recommended for HCW use in a particular clinical setting (7). \u201cOpportunity for PPE item use\u201d was defined as any instance of actual use of a PPE item during the study as well as any instance where the wearing of a PPE item was recommended by WHO guidelines (7). these items included PPE worn by HCWs involved in direct patient care (HCW close contacts) and ancillary HCWs high-risk close contacts, defined as \"household or close family contacts of a strongly suspected or confirmed avian influenza patient\" were not relevant to our study. the moderate-risk group included HCW close contacts wearing an inappropriate PPE set during any of their exposures. each hospital organized education sessions on PPE use, infection control practices, and protocol familiarization in the 1\u20132 weeks before the simulation. each site had at least 3 trained infection control observers available who were familiar with using a modified version of a validated hand hygiene assessment data input tool (8) to accurately record potential API exposures. study Definitions A HCW was defined as any person working within the healthcare facility. close contacts were counted only once. an \u201cexposure\u201d was counted each time a close contact came within 1 m of an API patient within or outside of an isolation room or area. HCW close contacts were stratified into either moderate- or low-risk groups. the moderate-risk group included HCW close contacts wearing an insufficient or inappropriate PPE set during any of their exposures. tertiary-level university teaching hospitals in 3 states of eastern Australia participated in the study (Table 2). the simulations occurred in the winter season, from May through August 2006. seven of the 9 simulations proceeded for the planned 6 hours of observation, and 2 were curtailed because of a critical need for the emergency department bed. the average number of close contacts for each API patient during the study period was 12.3 (median 11, range 6\u201317), with 19.3 exposures (median 20, range 15\u201326) HCW close contacts constituted 85% of all close contacts; the remainder were patients or visitors who were generally exposed in the triage area. 0 (0) 0 (1) 0 (2) 1 (1) 0 (0) 0 (2) \u2013 \u2013 0.1 (1.0) By HCW status Non-HCW 3 (3) 5 (5) 0 (0) 3 (3) 0 (0) 2 (2) 4 (4) 0 (0) 1.9 (1.9) HCW 14 (23) 10 (15) 6 (15) 11 (20) 11 (12) 12 (12) 9 5 3 9.6 (92) *API, avian (H5N1) or pandemic influenza; ED, to appropriate use by HCWs (HCW close contacts and ancillary HCWs) occurred in 93% of exposures. corresponding figures for disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection were lower (77%, 83%, and 73%, respectively) the proportions of HCW close contacts who appropriately wore a PPE set were 59% and 92%, respectively. from 8% to 41% of all HCW close contacts would be classified as having experienced a medium-risk exposure. this amounts to an average of 0.8 to 4.3 courses of antiviral medication per suspected API patient. a substantial minority of close contacts (15%; 2 per API patient) were non-HCWs (e.g., hospital patients or visitors), generated primarily in the triage area. the critical importance of effective PPE in hospital infection control was demonstrated during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 (10\u201314) patients who are assessed but are not sufficiently ill to require admission would require from 1,123,260 to 3,714,800 PPE sets. if stocks of readily available PPE were inadequate, the number of courses of antiviral medication required would likely increase dramatically, up to 12\u201313 courses per suspected API case during the initial 6-hour assessment. study was conducted at a less busy time of day for emergency departments. the patient was not clinically unwell or hypoxic; therefore, relatively few HCWs were required to assess, manage, or review the patient\u2019s condition. however, extending observation to include management of asymptomatic but potentially infectious accompanying persons in a standardized manner would have substantially increased the complexity of the exercise."}
