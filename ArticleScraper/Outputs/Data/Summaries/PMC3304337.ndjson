{"summary": "pattern recognition receptors directly recognize antigen determinants of virtually all classes of pathogens. pattern recognition receptors initiate an immune response via specific intracellular signaling pathways. pattern recognition receptors also have a key role in initiation and promotion of septic and aseptic inflammation. single nucleotide polymorphisms may alter the structure of enhancer sequences during splicing5 and affect mRNA stability. single nucleotide polymorphisms may alter transcription factor binding motifs, change the efficacy of enhancer or repressor elements, and alter the structure of translation initiation codons that may lead to downregulation of wild-type transcripts. the first wave of studies devoted to the association of polymorphisms of genes encoding toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors with cancer risk appeared only in 2004. the number of such papers was relatively small until 2008. however, more recent findings concerning specific potentially carcinogenic ligands were only obtained in the last few years. cytomegalovirus CLEC7A (Dectin-1) and PAMPs of mycobacterium spp CLEC1B (CLEC-2) and PAMPs of M. tuberculosis, C. albicans, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum CLEC4E (Mincle) and PAMPs of M. tuberculosis and C. albicans CLEC4A (DCIR cleotide polymorphisms of MRC1, CD207, LY75, CD209, CLEC1B may correlate with cancer types associated with HIV-1 infection. cleotide polymorphisms of genes indicated above may have functional consequences on the molecular level. a variant allele of rs691005 polymorphism, located within the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the MRC1 gene, is associated with a higher risk of sarcoidosis. the only study investigating the association of polymorphisms of genes encoding lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors with cancer risk is a study by Xu et al. increased celiac disease risk in HLA-DQ2-negative patients. increased risk of ulcerative colitis in rs4804803-positive patients. increased immune response may protect from hemorrhage during dengue fever,17 from lung cavitation. a variant allele of rs4804803 polymorphism is associated with impaired cytokine production by macrophages. a variant allele of rs16910526 polymorphism is associated with impaired cytokine production by macrophages31,32 and with a defective response to Aspergillus and Candida invasion. variant allele of rs11795404 induces abortive conformation of RIG-I. causing formation of unintended stable complexes between CARD modules of RIG-I and between RIG-I and its downstream adapter protein, MAVS. a variant allele of rs10813831 polymorphism is associated with a decrease in the rubella virus-specific granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-6 polymorphisms of genes coding for components of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway may modulate cancer risk as single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TLR gene family. a variant allele of rs17857295 and rs2326369 polymorphisms of the MAVS/VISA/IPS-1 gene was associated with a particular systemic lupus erythematosus phenotype. type lectin receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, and proteins of their signaling pathways with various diseases, and conditions or features Reference, population SNP number, variant allele frequency in cases and controls Disease or condition Sample size OR and 95% CI for carriers of variant allele. mrc1 Hattori et al13 Japanese, Afro-American populations rs2477637 (Japanese 0.605\u20130.645, Afro-American 0.686\u20130.667 rs691005 (Japanese 0.705\u20130.679, Afro-American 0.401\u20130.261) Japanese, no association;
