{"summary": "programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is indispensable for viruses to regulate protein expression levels from overlapping ORFs. in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 1 PRF occurs at a frequency of 5 to 10% at the junction of gag and pol genes. human telomerase pseudoknot adapts a canonical H-type pseudoknot configuration [18, 32] (PDB 1YMO) tertiary major-groove and minor-groove interactions (base triples) are represented by black dots between bases in the secondary structure depiction. this RNA structure is not involved in translational regulation, but rather in the activity of the telomerase complex. pseudoknots are characterized by base-pairing between a hairpin loop and a single-stranded region outside that loop. this brings remote regions of the RNA contour together and gives rise to more complex tertiary interactions, such as base-stacking and triplex base-pairing. the authors suspected that ANXA2 might interact more generally with other viral RNA pseudoknots, thus acting as an antiviral regulator in eukaryotic cells. the precise molecular mechanism remains elusive. single-molecule techniques and computational modeling can help to elucidate the mechanochemical basis for 1 PRF. a simple stem-loop can rotate freely during unwinding. the total unwinding work exerted by the ribosome would thus be larger than the G required for melting the pseudoknots. it can be inferred that 1 PRF efficiency should correlate more with the mechanical force required for \u201cpulling\u201d RNA pseudoknots apart. optical tweezers, two DNA handles are attached to micron-sized polystyrene beads through biotin-streptavidin and digoxigenin-antibody interactions. one of the beads is trapped by a laser beam, while the other is pulled by a micropipette or another trapping laser. a trapping laser and a micropipette that moves away from the trap produce tension force on the construct. pseudoknots with unfolding force above 60 pN would completely stall the ribosome and result in an abortive translation [32]. a similar experiment conducted by Hansen et al. showed that the work performed by optical tweezers during mechanical unfolding of a pseudoknot is much larger than the theoretically estimated free-energy cost (292 kJ/mol) optical tweezers previously demonstrated the slippery nature of a poly(U) template. a single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) uses this property to excite only the fluorescent samples immobilized on the surface, greatly reducing the background signal from free fluorescent molecules outside the evanescent field. the corresponding FRET efficiencies of single molecules can thus be measured and calculated individually. a slippery sequence appears to be even more efficient in promoting 1 PRF than the HIV-1 UUUUUUA motif. however, the quantitative relationships between these components require further investigations. coarse-Grained elastic network model provides unprecedented mechanochemical details for the underlying mechanisms. some mutations in Loop 2 are suspected to alter contacts with the ribosome. this gives rise to the possibility that specific interactions between the pseudoknot and the mRNA entry site could promote 1 PRF by inducing conformational changes of the ribosome complex allosterically. the close-up view on the right shows pseudoknot-stalled tRNA (tRNAPK) distortion relative to the stem-loop-stalled tRNA (tRNASL) the data implies that although both pseudoknot and stem-loop promote ribosome stalling, only pseudoknot can induce conformational changes in the ribosome complex. ENM is based on the view that protein dynamics is largely determined by the topology of native contacts. it takes even less time to calculate only the low-frequency modes that dominate macromolecular motions, making ENM especially suitable for modeling large complexes. ENM can guide the labeling scheme for future single-molecule experiments crucial for probing direct interactions between the ribosomal helicase and the pseudoknot. the magnitude of perturbation force exerted on the ribosome can be inferred from unwinding forces of pseudoknots provided by single-molecule measurements. computational modeling and simulations unravel the dynamic nature of molecules. single-molecule force and fluorescence spectroscopies probe real-time structural transitions for proteins [84\u201386], RNAs [87] and complexes [41, 88]. studies with mutant 1 PRF-promoting structures may facilitate drug discovery. combining biophysical tools sheds light on how future antiviral agents can be developed to work against the ubiquitous 1 PRF mechanisms among viruses."}
