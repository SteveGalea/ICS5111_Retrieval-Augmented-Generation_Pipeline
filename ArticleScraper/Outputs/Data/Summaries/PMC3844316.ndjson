{"summary": "canine parvovirus (CPV) is an important pathogen that causes acute enteric disease in dogs. it has mutated and spread across the world in dog populations. vovirus genus contains a single strand DNA genome of about 5200 nucleotides. there are three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3. the virus emerged as dog pathogen in the late 1970's as host variant of feline panleukopenia virus. some authors have suggested an update of the virus strains in current vaccines, taking into account the existing partial protection [21,22] some authors have suggested an update of the virus strains in current vaccines, taking into account the existing partial protection. the main differences in some amino acids of the VP2 gene are summarized in Table 1. these strains had Asp or His at position 427, Thr or Ala at position 440, Thr or Asn at position 440, Thr or Asn at position 512, and Pro or Thr at position 580. the main differences in some amino acids of the VP2 gene products are summarized in Table 1. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CPV-2a CPV-JS40 Nanjing 2011 KC556941 N - - A N - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CPV-2a CPV-JS62 Nanjing 2012 KC556951 N - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - clinical signs in the dogs given the isolated virus orally were exhibited on day 3 post-infection (p.i.) four out of nine dogs developed fever (body temperature 38.9\u00b0C), following anorexia, depression, and mild dehydration. mild to moderate mucoid or watery diarrhea were exhibited in all dogs of experimentally infected group on day 4 p.i. on day 4 p.i., some CPV-infected dogs (5/9) showed positive results in rectal swabs. on day 12 p.i., the number of positive results in rectal swabs decreased. however on day 12 p.i., the number of positive results in rectal swabs decreased. the presence of the virus in the cells was confirmed by cytopathic effect (CPE), viral hemagglutination (HA) and PCR. the highest HA titer of the virus was 1: 64 with porcine erythrocytes. epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration, necrosis and desquamation. similar pathological lesions were observed in all segments of the small and large intestines. epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration, necrosis and desquamation. CPV antigens were seen in myocardial fibers of the heart and in bronchiolar epithelial cells and walls of atria of the lung. CPV antigens were also seen in myocardial fibers of the heart and in bronchiolar epithelial cells and walls of the lung. only two (designated CPV-JS60 and CPV-JS63) out of 31 samples presented a GAT codon at the same position of VP2 protein, characteristic of CPV-2b. other 29 samples presented an AAT codon at position 426 of the VP2 protein, characteristic of CPV-2a. main differences in some amino acids of the VP2 gene products are summarized in Table 1. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CPV-2a CPV-JS59 Nanjing 2012 KC556955 N - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the observation of electron microscope showed a large quantity of 20\u201325 nm virus particles with cubic symmetry, typical of parvovirus. the titre of the isolated virus determined by the method of Reed and Munch was 104.86 TCID50/100 l. clinical scores of the experimentally infected dogs peaked on day 7 p.i. hemorrhagic enteritis of the small intestine was the predominant gross lesion observed from the pathology autopsy. the data are expressed as the mean standard error. in the two humanely euthanized dogs, hemorrhagic enteritis of the small intestine was the predominant gross lesion observed from the pathology autopsy. there were no apparent gross lesions in other tissues. each column represents virus load in an organ sample from one beagle. the presence of the virus in the cell cultures was confirmed by cytopathic effect (CPE), viral hemagglutination (HA) and PCR. the highest HA titer was 1: 64 with porcine erythrocytes. epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration, necrosis and desquamation. epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration and necrosis. epithelia of mucosa underwent degeneration and necrosis. in the IHC staining, viral antigens were detected in the lesions of various organs. they were primarily found in degenerated hepatocytes (Figure 4A), the marginal zone of spleen (Figure 4B), necrotic renal epithelial cells in the kidney (Figure 4C), necrotic nerve cells in the cerebrum (Figure 4D) and necrotic epithelia of the duodenum (Figure 4E) and the jejunum (Figure 4 the change of the amino acid at position 426 can differentiate the CPV2a (Asn), CPV2b (Asp) and CPV2c (Glu) CPV has a worldwide distribution. in many countries in Europe, such as united kingdom, Germany and Italy, CPV-2a has been overtaken by CPV-2b or CPV-2c. CPV-2a is the prevalent subtype in Nanjing, china. a high level of substitution in this region has been associated with the evolution of antigenic variants in circulating parvovirus types. all six pups infected with CPV-2c showed clinical signs of parvovirosis. none showed hemorrhagic diarrhea or vomiting and all recovered in a few days. it is reasonable to think that the types of CPV variants may not determine their pathogeneticity. all tested samples showed positive antigen staining. it suggests the disease may lead to a generalized infection. CPV is known to replicate in cardiac cells and induce a fatal myocarditis. 2a is the main CPV type that circulated in china between the years 2009 and 2012. the prevalent virus has been shown to be able to spread to all sampled tissues in dogs, including the brain. further epidemiological surveillance and pathogenetic investigation are needed for controlling parvovirus diseases in dogs. PCR products were purified with the Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa) cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) positive clones were selected and sequenced. four samples from animal clinics of Nanjing Agricultural University in 2009 were selected because of limited data. a total of 31 samples were sequenced. the sequences from this study were compared with the VP2 sequences of 5 reference strains of CPV. a 1 ml aliquot of virus stock (105.86 TCID50/ml) was used to inoculate each of nine beagles oronasally. the other three beagles were inoculated with 1 ml sterile PBS each as control. each dog is raised alone in the cage. two humanely euthanized beagles were necropsied and sampled. heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon and rectum were collected for virus detection and histopathological examinations. chromogenic substrate kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) was used for chromogenic detection following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. PCR products were purified with the Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa) and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) positive clones were selected and sequenced. virus isolation Fecal samples from three dogs were used for virus isolation. the sequences from this study were compared with the VP2 sequences of 5 reference strains of CPV (CPV-15, CPV-V120, CPV-39, CPV-Taichung and CPV-G7/97). a total of 31 samples were sequenced. clinical observations Clinical observations were monitored for 12 days post infection (p.i.) or until death using a record sheet. the average clinical scores were calculated based on the daily score. humanely euthanized beagles were fixed by submersion in Bouin\u2019s solution. tissue sections were prepared on slides and stained using an immunoperoxidase test. authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
