{"summary": "selecting the appropriate donor is of paramount importance to reducing the risk of infectious morbidity and mortality from donor-transmitted infections. it has become necessary to consider donors who may have active infection, high-risk infectious serologic profile, or high-risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection at the time of donation. a number of incidents of DTI have brought this topic to the forefront of attention. recent cases of rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM), west Nile virus (WNV), HIV, and HCV have all been confirmed as donor transmitted. DTIs are estimated to occur in 0.2%-1.7% of all transplant procedures, with varying morbidity and mortality[22,23]. Bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens all need to be contemplated by the transplant physician when called for opinion regarding donor suitability. this article serves to summarize the current literature about commonly encountered DTI. the outcome of allograft donation from a bacteremic donor depends on the type of bacteria causing infection, previous antimicrobial therapy in the donor prior to organ procurement. an estimated 5% of organ donors have unrecognized bacteremia at the time of donation[27,30,31]. if a donor is being treated for endocarditis, the recipient should receive organism-specific antimicrobial therapy for at least 2 wk. if the organism is Staphylococcus aureus, 6 wk of therapy is appropriate. if donor cultures are repeatedly positive for pathogenic bacteria or yeast, then additional consent from the recipient and/or family should be obtained. allografts from donors with deep-seated MRSA infections should only be accepted if the donor has been on appropriate antibiotic therapy for 48 h. if the potential allograft is the site of infection, the organ should be rejected. risk factors for VRE are similar to MRSA. studies have shown that using an allograft from a donor with a deep-seated infection from MDR organisms can result in transmission to the recipient even if pathogen directed therapy is used in the recipient. high rates of 30-d mortality have been reported when transplant recipients develop infection with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. the critical information involves whether the infection is sensitive to a carbapenem. multiple cases of donor-transmitted syphilis have been reported. the estimated prevalence of syphilis among potential organ donors is 0.15%. if the organ is accepted the recipient should be treated with a regimen for late latent syphilis. TUBERCULOSIS Almost 10000 cases of mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection were reported in the Unites States in 2012. rates of tuberculosis in patients from highly endemic areas are 20-74 times the general population with the prevalence of posttransplant tuberculosis approaching 12%. mycobacterium tuberculosis infection after transplant is associated with 20%-30% mortality rate. most cases of posttransplant tuberculosis are caused by reactivation of latent infection in the recipient following immunosuppressive therapy. this fact highlights the necessity of a thoughtful approach to the potential organ donor to limit the risk of a potentially catastrophic posttransplant infectious complication. lapse potential and increased risk of harboring drug-resistant TB isolates may lead to increased risk of donor-transmitted TB. this should be considered when monitoring and treating recipients of allografts from such donors. infections that are potentially donor derived include HIV, HCV, HBV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV- 1 and 2), etiologic agents of viral encephalitis, such as WNV, LCM and rabies virus, and viral respiratory pathogens. criteria have been established by the CDC which may increase the risk of donor transmission of HIV, HBV, and HCV. SM in the preceding 12 mo People who have had sex with a person who has had sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 12 mo People who have had sex with a person who has injected drugs for nonmedical reasons in the preceding 12 mo. child who is 18 mo of age and born to a mother known to be infected with, or at risk for HIV, HBV or HCV infection People who have injected drugs for nonmedical reasons in the preced s from anti-HBc positive donors has been noted since 1992. but after initially excluding these donors, it has been found that allografts from these donors can be safely used[86-89]. a thorough approach is needed for successful management of the recipient. a thorough approach is needed for successful management of the recipient. HBIG should be administered to liver allograft recipients who lack surface antibody to HBV. non-immune non-hepatic allograft recipients should also receive antiviral prophylaxis if the donor is anti-HBc positive. donors should be screened for clinical symptoms of an influenza-like illness. other types of allografts can be accepted if additional consent is obtained. non-lung allografts from donors with adenovirus infection should be rejected. allografts from patients with suspected viral encephalitis should not be accepted given the risk of transmission of WNV, rabies, LCM and herpes simplex virus infections. this recommendation may extend to cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis where bacterial meningitis has not been proven by either culture or antigen testing indicating a specific bacterial pathogen as the cause of infection. treatment of renal allograft recipients from donors with candiduria should consist of a tailored antifungal agent for urinary tract involvement. treatment should be continued for up to 6 wk depending on whether there is vascular involvement of the urinary tract. coccidioidomycosis is a dimorphic fungus that is endemic in the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central and South America. agar gel immunodiffusion, complement fixation antibody titers, and urine Histoplasma antigen should be undertaken. fluconazole at an average daily dose of 200-400 mg can be used depending on whether prophylaxis is primary or secondary. transmission of Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, and Strongyloides has been reported. the optimal screening procedure for schistosomiasis has not yet been established. Chagas disease is an infection caused by trypanosoma cruzi. it is endemic to Mexico, Central, and South America but has the potential to cause DTI in the setting of transplantation from a donor from an endemic region to a recipient in a non-endemic country. the need for allografts for the treatment of end-stage disease processes continues to grow. the need for allografts for the treatment of end-stage disease processes continues to grow. a key advancement has recently occurred with the passage of the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act) critical infrastructure is now in place to investigate potential donor-transmitted event. critical infrastructure is now in place to investigate potential donor-transmitted event."}
