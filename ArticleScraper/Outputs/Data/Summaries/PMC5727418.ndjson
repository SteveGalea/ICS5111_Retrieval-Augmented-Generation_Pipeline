{"summary": "COMMENTARY Cryptococcosis is usually observed in hosts with impaired immunity. this has led to its characterization as an \u201copportunistic pathogen\u201d (1). this has led to its characterization as an \u201copportunistic pathogen\u201d (1). e for the pathogen classes was underpinned by the idea that host damage stemming from the immune response to a microbe can drive disease pathogenesis. e for the pathogen classes was the idea that host damage stemming from the immune response to a microbe can drive disease pathogenesis. e for the pathogen classes was the idea that host damage stemming from the immune response to a microbe can drive disease pathogenesis. pneumocystis pneumonia is associated with intense inflammation in children and after initiation of therapy in patients with HIV/AIDS. inflammation may drive pneumocystis- and cryptococcus-mediated damage, even in patients with severely impaired immunity, defying their initial classifications as class 1 and 2 pathogens. a class 2 pathogen caused damage in the setting of a weak or normal immune response. the immune response fails to limit fungal growth, which results in host damage. the parabola that rises above the black dotted line represents the threshold for clinical disease. mice developed wasting and systemic inflammation evidenced by high levels of Th1-type cytokines compared to control mice that did not receive CD4+ T cells. this model demonstrated that CD4+ T cell reconstitution induced systemic inflammation in C. neoformans-infected mice that closely resembled ART-induced IRIS. infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited a Th1-type bias. depletion of CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced mortality and inflammatory pathology. this suggests a possible explanation for why inflammation is often a prominent feature of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected, but not HIV-infected. lomannan (GXM) could enhance CD4+ T cell activation and damage. this may explain paradoxical worsening of cryptococcosis in certain patients after initiation of antifungal therapy. a weak immune response can result in tissue damage due to fungal proliferation. knowledge of where the immune response of an individual lies along the immune response co ntinuum depicted by the DRF parabola."}
