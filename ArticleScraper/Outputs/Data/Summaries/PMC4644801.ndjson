{"summary": "the central nervous system (CNS) has been considered for many years as an organ immunologically isolated from the peripheral immune system. skin grafts and the direct inoculation of viruses, bacteria or antigens in the nervous parenchyma did not induce an immune response. in the last decade, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the CNS is not only immune-competent, but it actively interacts with cells of the peripheral immune system. infiltration of lymphocytes in the CNS under pathological conditions is a common hallmark in many pathological conditions. lymphocyte infiltration has been related to protective functions, as occurs in the facial nerve axotomy paradigm (Serpe et al., 1999) lymphocyte infiltration has been shown to contribute to the exacerbation of the pathology. this is the case of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Brochard et al., 2009), VIH virus infection (Petito et al., 2003), stroke (Yilmaz et al., 2006) and some autoimmune diseases (Dittel, 2008) the natural Treg (nTreg) and the induced Treg (iTreg) are generated in the thymus during the maturation of T-cells by recognition of self-peptides with intermediate affinity. the iTregs are produced in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and lymph nodes) from nave CD4+Foxp3- T-cells under both homeostatic conditions. Activated microglia are considered the main APC in the CNS Microglial cells are considered the sole representative of the immune system within the CNS parenchyma. the precise origin of microglia during development remains under debate. microglial cells become rapidly activated when the homeostasis of the CNS is perturbed. microglia can rapidly proliferate and increase the expression or de novo express a multitude of different molecules. cytokines, chemokines and trophic factors make them able to modulate both the innate and the acquired immune responses within the CNS. expression of MHCs in microglia Resident glial cells, principally microglia, can establish a cross-talk with infiltrated T-cells regulating their recruitment, activation and function within the CNS. expression of MHCs in the absence of co-stimulation leads to the apoptosis or anergy of T-cells. ischemia and kainic acid injection (Finsen et al., 1993), graft vs. host disease (Sedgwick et al., 1998), facial nerve axotomy (Streit et al., 1989; Villacampa et al., 2015), entorhinal cortex lesion (Bechmann et al., 2001; Kwidzinski et al., 2003a) and different kar et al., 2011 Jin et al., 2013 Inhibition PD-1 B7H1 (PD-L1) + EAE models Schreiner et al., 2008 PPT Lipp et al., 2007 B7DC (PD-L2) n.d. \u2013 \u2013 Inhibition Unknown B7H4 n.d. \u2013 \u2013 Inhibition Unknown BTNL n.d. PT, perforant pathway transection; FNA, facial nerve axotomy; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; TMEV, Theiler\u2019s induced encephalitis; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; MS, multiple sclerosis. de novo expression of B7.1 and/or B7.2 has been reported in microglial cells. the ICOS-ICOSL pathway has important roles in the fine-tuning of effector T-cell functions and the control of T-cell tolerance. PD-1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of T-cell responses, expressed at low levels on the surface of T, B and natural killer T-cells. no studies regarding the expression of B7H3, B7H4, B7S3 or BTNL specifically in microglia are available in the literature. a second family of co-stimulatory receptors, the TNFR family, has been reported in the immune system. autoimmunity induced by thiamine deficiency (Ke et al., 2005), human HIV (D\u2019Aversa et al., 2002, 2005), different animal models of autoimmunity such as EAE (Becher et al., 2001; Ponomarev et al., 2006) and MS (Vogel et al., 2013). inhibition of CD40 in microglia results in the attenuation of -a expression of MHC-II in activated microglia in vivo has been reported. only a limited number of studies have addressed the question of whether activated MHC-II+ microglia simultaneously express co-stimulatory molecules.

ICOS-ICOSL pathway has important roles in fine-tuning effector T-cells. PD-1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of T-cell responses. PD-1 has two counter-receptors that are expressed on the surface of APCs. no studies on the expression of its ICOSL ligand on microglia are available. a second family of co-stimulatory receptors, the TNFR family, has been reported in the immune system. a second family of co-stimulatory receptors, the TNFR family, has been reported in the immune system. inhibition of CD40 in microglia results in the attenuation of -amyloid pathology and reduction of EAE severity. a subtype of DCs induced by IL27 has been shown to increase expression of CD39 and exert protective functions in EAE. the precise mechanism by which CD39 regulates T-cell responses is not clear. expression of CD39 and CD73 in the membrane of microglial cells has been extensively reported to regulate ATP levels within the CNS. it is easy to suggest that regulation of the expression of those enzymes in activated microglia take part in modulating the final outcome of infiltrated T-cells. perivascular space and juxtavascular parenchyma are considered strategically well-positioned for communication with blood-circulating pathogens or T-cells. these locations are considered strategically well-positioned for the communication with blood-circulating pathogens or T-cells. with aging, the number of DCs increases markedly in the perivascular space, meninges and choroid plexuses. the actual knowledge regarding the function of DCs in the brain come from studies using the inoculation of different types of DCs into the CNS under different circumstances. a question not yet addressed in this kind of studies is how these DCs interact with both glial cells and blood\u2013borne infiltrated cells. vascular or meningeal DCs observed in the healthy brain are recruited to inflammatory sites within the CNS parenchyma. other authors supported the idea that parenchymal DCs observed during neuroinflammatory conditions come from infiltrated monocytes. infiltration of monocytes is a common event in many of the above-mentioned neuroinflammatory situations. a population of professional DCs expressing MHC-class II and CD11c or ED2 are found in the meninges, the choroid plexuses and the perivascular space. under specific neuroinflammatory conditions, such as infections, traumatic brain injury or EAE, DCs have been also reported within the CNS parenchyma. a study using the CD11c-GFP mouse reported the presence of CD11c+ cells in the choroid plexuses and perivascular space. almost all CD11c+ cells in the juxtavascular parenchyma presented markers of microglial cells such as Iba1 and CD11b. a subpopulation of microglial cells is presumably able to express DC markers in steady-state conditions. a population of microglial cells that come from microglia can acquire the phenotype of DCs and consequently may act as professional APCs. one issue to be resolved is if these parenchymal DCs that come from microglia develop the same functions as other DCs or, conversely, may act as professional APCs. research to help clarify the question of the origin and a more complete characterization of the role played by these cells during the evolution of neuroinflammatory processes. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
