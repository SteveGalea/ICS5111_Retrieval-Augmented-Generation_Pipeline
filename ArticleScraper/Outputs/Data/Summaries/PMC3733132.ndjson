{"summary": "2-microglobulin (2M) is a low molecular weight, non-glycosylated protein synthesized by all nucleated cells. it composes the small, invariable light chain subunit of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen through non-covalent linkage on the cell surface. chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were made from 10-day embryos supplied by Merial-Vital Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing, China) a pair of specific primers was designed to amplify the full-length ch2M from the total RNA of the chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells. monoclonal antibodies BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 g synthetic peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant. boosted with 150 g in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 2 weeks later and 200 g in 0.01 M/L PBS (pH 7.2) after another 3 weeks. the lysates were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 r/min for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the samples of the supernatants, chicken serum, and plasma were respectively diluted 1:5 in sample buffer (0.5 M Tris [pH 7.0], with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, and 5% -mercaptoethanol) cells cultured in logarithmic growth phase were collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min. cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0C with 200 L ch2M MAb 3D1 at a 1:100 dilution in PBS with 1% BSA. HD11 cells were a replication-defective avian leukemia virus MC29-transformed macrophage-like cell line. cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 41\u00b0C and 5% CO2. chicken embryo fibroblasts were made from 10-day embryos supplied by Merial-Vital Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing, China) according to conventional procedures. the primer sequences contained the restriction site EcoR I in the forward primer (P1) and Xho I in the reverse primer (P2) positive clones (pGEM-T-ch2M) from an independent PCR reaction were sequenced by the Shanghai Sangon Company (China) the sequence was synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) the recombinant expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-ch2M was transfected into 293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000. cells were cultured for 48 h to express ch2M proteins. pcDNA3.1 vector DNA was as control. the cells were incubated with acetone-alcohol (3:2) for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. the cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. frozen sections of thymus, spleen, and bursa from 28-day-old chickens were fixed in chilled acetone for 30 min. they were then blocked with 5% horse serum in PBS and incubated with MAb diluted 1:500 with dilution buffer. the sections were then developed with diaminobenzidine substrate and hydrogen peroxide. 2M gene (B53282) has only seven amino acid substitutions at positions 81, 86, 95, 95, 96, 96, 97, 99, and 103. ch2M shared only 44.2% and 42.5% amino acid identity with human and mouse 2M. most of the amino acid substitutions were focused on the signal peptide domain and the C terminus. immunogluobin subtypes were identified as IgM for MAbs 1E2, 2E9, 7D5, and IgG1/ for MAbs 6E7 and 3D1. MAbs recognized a 12 kDa protein band from the lysates of 293T/ch2M. these MAbs also reacted with ch2M antigen from HD11 cells. the staining pattern by confocal positioning indicated that the MAb 3D1 reacted with ch2M epitopes on both the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of HD11 cells. HD11 cells (Fig. 3A, a) and CEF cells (Fig. 3A, b) demonstrated different expression levels of ch2M. thymus sections showed much stronger staining in medullary cells and mesenchyme, but weak staining in the cortical area. the thymus sections were strongly positive, but in a patchy fashion, with the most positive patches corresponding to lymphocyte-rich areas. ch2M shared only 44.2% and 42.5% amino acid identity with human and mouse 2M, respectively. most of the amino acid substitutions were focused on the signal peptide domain and the C terminus, which suggest that the C-terminus' amino acids are specific to ch2M. MAbs recognized a 12 kDa protein band from the lysates of 293T/ch2M. these MAbs also reacted with ch2M antigen from HD11 cells. the same band was found in chicken sera and plasma. HD11 cells showed different expression levels of ch2M. ch2M in HD11 cells produced a significantly stronger reaction than that in CEF cells. Flow cytometry analysis results showed that MAb 3D1 specifically could bind to the ch2M antigen on the membrane surface of MSB1 cells. antibody 6E7 and 3D1 are specific to the ch2M and no cross-reaction with human 2M. despite previous suggestions that 2M was relatively conserved between the different poultry species, we found that antibody 6E7 and 3D1 could not react. ch2M contains a typical -sheet with no -helix. the 20 amino acid residues of the C-terminus of ch2M consist of two discontinuous -sheets. the ch2M antigen is abundant on the surface of white blood cells. the biological functions of ch2M still need to be investigated. these MAbs will be good tools for analyzing the mechanism of the chicken immune system."}
