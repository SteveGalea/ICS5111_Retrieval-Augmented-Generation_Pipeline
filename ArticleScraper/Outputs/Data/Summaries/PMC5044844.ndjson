{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV), an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, is a common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (2\u20134). almost every person is exposed to HMPV in the first decade of life. nearly 100% of individuals test seropositive for antibody reactivity to HMPV antigens by the age of 10 (5). HS is a negatively charged polysaccharide belonging to the family of glycosaminoglycans composed of repeating disaccharide units formed by glucosamine and glucuronic acid. glucosamine can be N-acetylated, or N-sulfated and O-sulfated, in various positions and to various degrees. HSPGs have been implicated in virus-cell interactions for other viruses. occluding heparan sulfate with the peptide dendrimer SB105-A10 inhibits the binding interaction between HMPV F and target cells and airway tissues. these results provide additional support for a role for a role for HS-HMPV F protein interactions in physiologically relevant models. a rabbit polyclonal antibody against avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) was used to detect HMPV M protein by Western blotting (36) all other antibodies were purchased from the various companies: -actin (Sigma) and peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG. 10,000 cells were grown in triplicate overnight in a 96-well plate. cells were either incubated with 2 M SB105-A10 for 1 h, 40 g of iota-carrageenan/ml for 4 h or 10 M concentrations of each of the K5 derivatives for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatants of harvested cells and medium were subjected to centrifugation at 2,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C on a tabletop centrifuge. the supernatant was then stored in 1 sucrose phosphate glutamate (SPG; 218 mM sucrose, 0.0049 M l-glutamic acid, 0.0038 M KH2PO4, 0.0072 M K2HPO4) aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and th rgPIV5 was propagated in MDBK cells as described previously (40) and stored in 1 SPG. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed twice prior to storage at 80\u00b0C. the membrane was washed with t-TBS and incubated with superSignal west Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Fisher) for 10 min in the dark prior to development by using enhanced chemiluminescence. densitometry was quantified using ImageQuant TL, and an average density units of M protein per l of virus input was calculated. after 2 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and the infection medium was replaced. the cells were resuspended, fixed in 2% formaldehyde diluted in PBS with 50 mM EDTA. the data presented in the graphs represent the percentage of GFP-expressing cells as a percentage of the untreated control as previously described (17). the tissues were treated with 2 M SB105-A10 in Opti-MEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C prior to infection. the infection solution (100 l at an MOI of 5) was added to the apical surface of the tissues dropwise. after 2 h, the infection medium was aspirated, and the apical surface washed 1 with 200 l of HBS. the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and infected with 500 l of virus solution at an MOI of 1 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with rocking to prevent internalization. the cells were thawed and scraped on ice, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 55,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. primary normal bronchial human airway epithelial (HAE) tissue cultures were purchased from MatTek Corp. (Ashland, MA) cell culture inserts were placed atop two washers (MatTek) in six-well plates with 5 ml of AIR 100 growth medium (MatTek) in contact with the basal surface and incubated at an air-liquid interface at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. 10,000 cells were grown in triplicate overnight in a 96-well plate. cells were either incubated with 2 M SB105-A10 for 1 h, 40 g of iota-carrageenan/ml for 4 h, or 10 M concentrations of each of the K5 derivatives for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatants of harvested cells and medium were subjected to centrifugation at 2,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C on a tabletop centrifuge. the supernatant was then stored in 1 sucrose phosphate glutamate (SPG; 218 mM sucrose, 0.0049 M l-glutamic acid, 0.0038 M KH2PO4, 0.0072 M K2HPO4) aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and th viral titers were calculated by creating serial dilutions of viral samples in Opti-MEM. the number of GFP-expressing cells was counted in wells. for non-GFP expressing viruses, viral particles were estimated. membrane washed with t-TBS and incubated with superSignal west Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Fisher) for 10 min in the dark prior to development by using enhanced chemiluminescence. densitometry was quantified using ImageQuant TL, and an average density units of M protein per l of virus input was calculated for each sample. the cells were resuspended, fixed in 2% formaldehyde diluted in PBS with 50 mM EDTA, and analyzed with a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. the data presented in the graphs represent the percentage of GFP-expressing cells as a percentage of the untreated control as previously described (17). the tissues were treated with 2 M SB105-A10 in Opti-MEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C prior to infection. the infection solution (100 l at an MOI of 5) was added to the apical surface of the tissues dropwise. after 2 h, the infection medium was aspirated, and the apical surface washed 1 with 200 l of HBS. the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and infected with 500 l of virus solution at an MOI of 1 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with rocking to prevent internalization. the cells were thawed and scraped on ice, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 55,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. carrageenans have shown antiviral activity against a number of viral pathogens. iota-carrageenan has been used safely in human trials in form of a nasal spray to reduce viral infection (47\u201349) paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) does not use HS for binding. similar effects of iota-carrageenan on rgHMPV and rgPIV5 infection were observed in vero cells. results indicate that HS-HMPV interactions are critical in BEAS-2B cells. HMPV viruses (WT and recombinant mutants G and GSH) were treated with vehicle or 40 g of iota-carrageenan/ml and added to BEAS-2B cells at an MOI of 1 at 4\u00b0C for particle binding. HMPV was added to beAS-2B cells at 4\u00b0C, allowing for binding to occur but not infection. the amount of bound virus was quantified by detection of the HMPV matrix protein present in cell lysates. iota-carrageenan competes with the binding of HMPV to HS. GSH HMPV binding to BEAS-2B cells was more efficient on a per particle basis. the input number of particles for all three virus samples was verified for each experiment. the ratio of F to M protein in WT, G, and GSH HMPVs was determined by Western blotting. the data are reported as a ratio of the percent bound M to the input. the input of the three viruses was determined by Western blotting by detection of M and quantified by calculating the band intensity. iota-carrageenan-treated rgHMPV was used to inoculate the apical surfaces of the HAE tissues. iota-carrageenan-treated rgHMPV was used to inoculate the apical surfaces of the HAE tissues. a significant reduction in infection of approximately 75% was observed. a small library of derivatives with different degrees of sulfation has been synthesized using chemical and enzymatic modifications (38) sulfated K5 derivatives have been shown to inhibit infection in other viruses in a specific manner, including HPV (43), RSV (55), dengue virus (56), cytomegalovirus (57), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (58), and HIV (59) flow cytometry analysis of infected cells revealed dose-dependent inhibition of HMPV infection by all the O-sulfated K5 derivatives. rgHMPV was treated with a 1 M concentration of each of the K5 derivatives prior to incubation with BEAS-2B cells at 4\u00b0C at an MOI of 1. beAS-2B cells were infected with rgHMPV (B) or rgPIV5 (C) at an MOI of 1 treated with a 10 nM, 100 nM, or 1 M concentration of each K5 polysaccharide derivative or vehicle. infection was quantified by flow cytometry to detect GFP-expressing cells at 24 h postinfection. the data are reported as a ratio of M to -actin normalized to the untreated control for each virus. beAS-2B cells were treated with 40 g of iota-carrageenan/ml. the absorbance at 590 nm was normalized to the untreated control. highly sulfated K5 polysaccharide derivatives inhibit HMPV infection in HAE. HAE tissues were infected with rgHMPV or rgPIV5 at an MOI of 5 treated with 10 M K5-N,OS(H) or K5-OS(H) or with vehicle. occluding compounds that prevent further ligand binding are less likely to disrupt preexisting HS interactions. a compound that occludes HS may serve as a potential building block for antiviral development for HMPV and other viruses known to bind HS. the effects of SB105-A10 on rgHMPV or rgPIV5 infection were not reduced. both BEAS-2B and A549 cells were used to determine if the effect of SB105-A10 is cell type-dependent. this compound is mediating its effects by interacting with the target cell. beAS-2B cells treated with 1 M SB105-A10 or vehicle were infected with rgHMPV or rgPIV5 at an MOI of 1. the cells were imaged at 24 h postinfection. the data are reported as a ratio of M to -actin normalized to the untreated control for each virus. the data are reported as a ratio of M to -actin normalized to the untreated control for each virus. sulfated polysaccharide, heparan sulfate mimetics and compound occludes HS in combination with infection studies in human bronchial epithelial cells. iota-carrageenan has been used safely in human trials in the form of a nasal spray to reduce viral infection (47\u201349). iota-carrageenan, a well-characterized sulfated polysaccharide, has been shown to inhibit the infection of other viruses that bind HS. infection of BEAS-2B cells was performed using a recombinant HMPV (strain CAN97-83, clade A2) that results in green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. iota-carrageenan inhibits HMPV infection in cells and tissues by blocking binding. beAS-2B cells were infected with rgPIV5 at an MOI of 1. cells were imaged 24 HPI. the data are reported as a ratio of M to -actin normalized to the untreated control for each virus. the data are reported as a ratio of M to -actin normalized to the untreated control. recombinant HMPVs without G or SH, HMPV G and GSH, respectively, are replication competent in a nonhuman primate model of infection. we pretreated the recombinant HMPV G and GSH with iota-carrageenan and determined the effects on overall infection and binding in BEAS-2B cells. increased binding is not due to increased per particle F protein levels. iota-carrageenan inhibits binding of WT and recombinant HMPVs without G and SH in a manner that is dependent on F and not the other surface glycoproteins. the data are reported as a ratio of the mean F to the mean M abundance. the results in a monolayer cell culture model are limited in the ability to recapitulate the complex features of the respiratory epithelium. however, a monolayer cell culture model is limited in the ability to recapitulate the complex features of the respiratory epithelium. a-carrageenan had no effect on infection in the airway tissues. HS interactions with HS are also important in complex polarized airway tissues that histologically resemble the human respiratory tract. sulfated K5 polysaccharide derivatives mimic HS. highly sulfated derivatives, mainly K5-N,OS(H) and K5-OS(H), dramatically inhibited infection. rgHMPV at an MOI of 1 pretreated with the derivatives at 1 M was used to inoculate BEAS-2B cells. treatment of BEAS-2B cells with a 10 M concentration of the K5 polysaccharide derivatives did not reduce cell viability. rgHMPV was treated with a 1 M concentration of each of the K5 polysaccharide derivatives prior to incubation with BEAS-2B cells at 4\u00b0C at an MOI of 1 to allow for binding to take place. infection was quantified by flow cytometry to detect GFP-expressing cells at 24 h postinfection. data are presented as the percent infection of the untreated control. single (*) and double (**) asterisks indicate statistical significances of P 0.01 and P 0.0001 respectively. HAE tissues were infected with rgHMPV or rgPIV5 at an MOI of 5 treated with 10 M K5-N,OS(H) or K5-OS(H) or with vehicle (untreated) at 48 h postinfection, we observed a dramatic reduction in infected cells at the apical surface. heparan sulfate occlusion inhibits HMPV infection and binding. the removal of HS caused a robust block in HMPV infection. a compound that occludes HS may serve as a building block for antiviral development for HMPV and other viruses that are known to bind HS. dendrimer SB105-A10 has a branched peptide core with clusters of basic residues that bind to negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups. the peptide has previously been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against RSV (54), CMV (61), HIV (62), HPV (63), and HSV-1 and HSV-2 (64), as well as some filoviruses (65). B cells 2 M SB105-A10, the highest concentration used in any cell or tissue experiments, did not reduce cell viability. based on our hypothesis of HMPV attachment, we predicted that SB105-A10 inhibits infection by blocking particle binding, specifically by preventing the interaction between heparan sulfate and F. rgPIV5 at an MOI of 1 treated with variable concentrations of SB105-A10 in BEAS-2B (B) and A549 (C) cells was quantified using flow cytometry. the percent infection is reported normalized to the untreated control for each virus type. treatment with rgHMPV or rgPIV5 resulted in a >50% reduction in HMPV infection at the apical surface with SB105-A10 treatment compared to vehicle-treated control tissues. occlusion of HS on target cells inhibits HMPV binding and infection mediated by HMPV F. sulfated polysaccharides, iota-carrageenan and the heparan sulfate-like K5 polysaccharide derivatives inhibit this attachment step. occluding heparan sulfate with SB105-A10 also blocks HMPV binding by occluding HS from interaction with HMPV F. ymerized galactans ranging in molecular masses from 52 to 64 kDa were able to inhibit HMPV infection, as well as the intact polysaccharide. the potent anti-HMPV effect of iota-carrageenan on HMPV infection in both cells and tissue models has potential as a respiratory therapy. our results support the model that HMPV binding to HS mediated by F involves charge-charge interaction. this is demonstrated by the very high inhibitory activity exerted by K5-OS (H) this finding suggests the interaction between HMPV F and HS depends on a specific sulfation pattern rather than overall negative charges alone. recombinant HMPV viruses did not reveal a greater F content relative to the M viral protein. recombinant viruses bind and infect at WT levels in other cell types. this suggests there may be cell-type-specific differences in binding. heparan sulfate has been hypothesized to localize exclusively to the basolateral epithelium (50), making it unclear how a respiratory virus would access HS to infect apically. HS occlusion with SB105-A10 has also been shown to inhibit RSV infection at the apical surfaces of HAE tissues."}
