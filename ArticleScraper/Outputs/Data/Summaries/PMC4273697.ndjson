{"summary": "the single biggest advance in the management of ARDS has been the institution of lung protective ventilation (ARDSNet) mortality remains unacceptably high, ranging from the 32% to 41% reported in randomised controlled trials up to 44% in published observational studies [3],[4]. there has been uncertainty about the underlying pathophysiology and the link between the degree of pulmonary hypertension and outcome from ARDS. pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg Moderate PH - mPAP between 30 and 45 mmHg Severe PH - mPAP > 45 mmHg [6],[7] Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) mPAP-PAOP/cardiac output Pulmonary vascular resistance index mPAP-PAOP/cardiac output. studies that relate pulmonary haemodynamic variables to outcome from ARDS Study period Number PAP mmHg (mean PAP unless specified) PAOP mmHg Independent predictors of survival PAP PVR (I) Zapol and Snider [9] Pre 1977 30 28 to 32 (2.5 to 4.8) n/a N Y (trend) Villar et al.

Thrombosis Tomashefski et al. found 19 patients had evidence of microthrombi. nineteen had macrothrombi in the pulmonary arterial and capillary vessels. TF is a strong activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade. ARDS represents a procoagulant, anti-fibrinolytic phenotype and results in the local formation of microthrombi. vascular remodelling is a characteristic of the late stage of ARDS. it is present in approximately 55% of patients who die of this condition. mechanical disruption of the course of blood vessels is likely to contribute to the sustained elevation in PVR seen in non-survivors. the change in PVR is determined by the balance between overdistension of lung units and recruitment of areas with previously low numbers of open alveoli. pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) was lowest at 5 cm H2O in the normal lung but 10 cm H2O had to be applied to the injured lung. studies of pulmonary haemodynamics report inconsistent relationships with mortality. any effect of the mode of ventilation on PVR is likely to be related to the amount of PEEP and plateau pressure that is applied. in clinical practice, there is considerable variability in preload of patients with ARDS. bull et al.'s study found no association between PAP and outcome. the protocol standardised many extrinsic factors that can influence PA pressure independently of changes in pulmonary vascular resistance in ARDS. acute cor pulmonale (ACP) has been defined as the presence of RV dilation (ratio of RV end-diastolic area to left ventricle end-diastolic area >0.6) in association with dyskinesia of the interventicular septum in response to an increased afterload [19]. vieillard-Baron et al. have demonstrated an incidence of echocardiographic cor pulmonale of 25% in a study of 75 patients with ARDS [19],[61]. however, ACP was found to be reversible in those patients whose ARDS resolved, and it did not have a negative prognostic significance. the incidence of ACP in ARDS is still 22% and is independently associated with mortality in spite of greater use of nitric oxide and prone positioning. the relationship between ACP and outcome in ARDS is therefore unclear, and it remains to be determined. a non-specific pulmonary vasodilator (nifedipine) [70] or the phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor tadalafil [75] reduced the prevalence of pulmonary oedema in HAPE-susceptible individuals after rapid ascent to 4,559 m from 60% to about 10%. this suggests that excessive HPV may contribute to the development of acute oedema, possibly by redistributing pulmonary blood flow away ARDS may be due to injury to the pulmonary capillaries from inflammation and thrombosis and obstruction of pulmonary blood flow in the extra-alveolar pulmonary circulation. if PVD is primarily a downstream result of the activation of the inflammatory-coagulation cascade in the lung, then the reason it is associated with mortality in ARDS may be because it reflects the severity of the underlying inflammatory process. pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are linked to mortality in ARDS. pulmonary haemodynamics, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular dysfunction, right ventricle, right ventricular failure, acute cor pulmonale, or pulmonary artery catheter are also linked. pulmonary haemodynamics in ARDS Many indices of pulmonary haemodynamics have been measured in patients with ARDS. the two most commonly reported measures are pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. studies that relate pulmonary haemodynamic variables to outcome from ARDS Study period Number PAP mmHg (mean PAP unless specified) PAOP mmHg Independent predictors of survival PAP PVR (I) Zapol and Snider [9] Pre 1977 30 28 to 32 (2.5 to 4.8) n/a N Y (trend) Villar et al.

AP were not identified as being of prognostic significance. pulmonary vascular resistance and ARDS Pulmonary vascular resistance are known to be elevated in patients with ARDS. pulmonary artery pressure; PAOP, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; RAP, right atrial pressure; SVI, stroke volume index. the findings were replicated by Villar et al. there are marked differences between these studies, with some showing that pulmonary arterial pressure is independently associated with mortality. increased PVR was found to be a predictor of adverse outcome in some studies and not in others. the plot of mean pressure against flow is curvilinear with an intercept on the pressure axis that is equal to left atrial pressure. the blue curve represents a normal pressure flow curve (healthy lung), while the red curve represents pressure flow curve in the presence of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. at each cardiac output the pulmonary vascular resistance, (Ppa-LAP)/Q, is illustrated as the slope of the straight dashed line. airway pressure can have a marked effect on pulmonary blood flow. low (near residual volume) lung volumes were associated with a slight elevation in PVR. high lung volumes were associated with the highest PVR. this contributes to a marked elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance. plot of pressure against flow is a straight line passing through the origin. resistance to flow is well characterised as the ratio of the arterial pressure to the flow (cardiac output) in the systemic (A) and pulmonary (B) circulations. arterial pressure (mean); pulmonary arterial pressure (mean); Q, cardiac output (flow). a curvilinear relationship arises because of the marked distensibility of the pulmonary vasculature. increase in pulmonary arterial pressure results in an increased flow due both to the higher driving pressure and the distension of the vessels so that the diameter of the vascular lumen is increased. pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance cannot be used as interchangeable measures of the state of pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with ARDS. we will highlight the pathophysiology of some of the candidate mechanisms that explain an elevation in PVR in ARDS. the total lung PVR was 339 (29) dyne.s.cm5.m2 and increased by 28.9% to 437 (36) dyne.s.cm5.m2 when PvO2 was reduced to low values (46.6 0.1 mmHg) there is now ample evidence supporting the concept of lung injury causing local, as opposed to systemic, coagulation in ARDS. blockade of TF-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex may reduce degree of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS [44] levels of protein C, a natural anti-coagulant, are also reduced in ARDS [45] while levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 are increased in ARDS patients. biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation have been shown to provide good discrimination for the diagnosis of patients with ARDS [47],[48]. vascular remodelling was associated with distorted, tortuous arteries and veins. the number of capillaries was reduced, and they were often dilated. this mechanical disruption of the course of blood vessels is likely to contribute to the sustained elevation in PVR seen in non-survivors. benzing et al. took 11 patients with severe ARDS treated by veno-venous extracorporeal lung assist and ventilated them with an FiO2 of 1.0 for a period of 20 min prior to taking measurements. they then manipulated the mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen (PvO2) by adjusting the proportion of blood flow diverted through the oxygenator in order to assess HPV in non-ventilated regions. TF is a strong activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade. blockade of the TF-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex may reduce the degree of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS. remodelling Fibroproliferation is a characteristic of the late stage of ARDS. it is present in approximately 55% of patients who die of this condition. the presence of fibrosis on thin cut CT scan has been used to predict outcome in ARDS. the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) was lowest at 5 cm H2O in the normal lung but 10 cm H2O had to be applied to the injured lung in order to achieve minimal PVRi [58] there is currently no evidence that one mode of ventilation has more or less effect than any other mode on pulmonary vascular haemodynamics. pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) was lowest at 5 cm H2O in the normal lung but 10 cm H2O had to be applied to the injured lung in order to achieve minimal PVRi [58] there is currently no evidence that one mode of ventilation has more or less effect than any other mode on pulmonary vascular haemodynamics. in clinical practice, there is considerable variability in the preload of patients with ARDS. both volume loading and venous tone have a considerable influence on the amount of venous return reaching the heart. the presence of sepsis and the use of vasopressors will both affect venous tone. indices of pulmonary vascular dysfunction (mPAP-PAOP and PVRi) and mortality were found to independently predict greater mortality in ARDS. pulmonary hypertension may result in right ventricular failure (RVF) in ARDS patients. clinically, right ventricular failure has no agreed definition, but criteria include pulmonary hypertension associated with an RV cardiac index 2.5 L min1 m2 and a right atrial pressure >8 mmHg. the presence of RVF was not associated with death. the presence of RVF can also be inferred using echocardiographic criteria. a retrospective analysis of 352 patients with acute lung injury found a correlation between plateau pressure and the incidence of acute cor pulmonale. as measured plateau pressure increased, the incidence of ACP rose up to 42% with plateau pressures of >35 cm H2O. this did not hold true when the airway pressure was aggressively limited, in line with current practice. in both studies, groups with ACP had a higher use of nitric oxide and prone positioning compared to those without ACP. the relationship between ACP/RVD and outcome in ARDS is therefore unclear, and it remains to be determined. a subset of the population is prone to the development of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. ARDS is characterised by heterogeneous areas of alveolar hypoxia. there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in the general population who present with ARDS. PVD is associated with mortality in well-controlled studies of patients with ARDS. right ventricular dysfunction has not been consistently shown to be associated with mortality. ARDS studies are rarely adequately powered to look at mortality as they do not recruit sufficient numbers of patients. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
