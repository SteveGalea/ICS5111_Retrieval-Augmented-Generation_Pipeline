{"summary": "Resident Cells of the CNS Secrete Chemokines in Response to Viral Infection Chemokines are now recognized as critical regulators of leukocyte trafficking into the CNS. astronomytes and microglia are the primary source of chemokines following infection with a wide range of neurotropic viruses. in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted that CNS viral infection often results in distinct chemokine signature patterns. TLR2 and TLR3 cooperation leads to the expression of the macrophage chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL5 [3], while TLR2 and TLR9 mediate chemokine expression during HSV-1 infection [4], [9]. chemokines regulate glial-derived chemokine expression in response to CNS infection with LCMV (Traub strain) and HSV-1 [2], [9]. infection of mice with neurotropic virus results in rapid accumulation of neutrophils to the CNS [13], [14] studies using the JHMV model system have provided insight into the functional relevance of neutrophil migration to the CNS. astrocyte- and endothelial-derived expression of CXC chemokines, including CXCL1, attracts CXCR2-reactive neutrophils to the CNS. expression of chemokines early in response to infection with neurotropic viruses aids in effective host defense by promoting vascular permeability and regulating parenchymal lymphocyte infiltration. consequences of BBB degradation can vary from efficient viral clearance to fatal encephalitis and seizures. CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes are attracted by the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 respectively. they mediate viral control through direct cytolytic activity and/or cytokine secretion. CXCL12, which signals through CXCR4, may sequester T lymphocytes within the perivascular space. okine expression during viral infection promotes the generation and infiltration of immune effector cells necessary for quelling viral replication. fatal meningoencephalitis induced by LCMV infection is mediated by infiltration of virus-specific CTLs that promote subsequent myeloid cell and leukocyte entry [15], [25]. During infection with LCMV, sustained CXCL10 and CCL5 expression leads to continuing immune cell infiltration that manifests an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. the biological roles of chemokines in host defense and/or disease are constantly evolving. chemokines and their receptors are potentially relevant targets for treating various viral-induced neuropathies by dampening specific biological functions associated with disease."}
