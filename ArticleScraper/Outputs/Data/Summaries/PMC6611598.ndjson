{"summary": "five species are known with four causing hemorrhagic fevers in humans. EBOV enters host cells by binding to attachment factors such as lectins and TIM/TAM family members. GP is a class I fusion protein present at the surface of the virion. early work showed that host cell entry mediated by GPcl remains sensitive to lysosomotropic agents and the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d. these findings suggested that GPcl requires low pH and an additional activity inhibited by E64d, perhaps additional cathepsin cleavage, to trigger its fusion ability. our findings suggest neither the NPC1-C-loop nor full-length NPC1 are sufficient to trigger significant fusion at any pH tested. even the presence of additional factors including a reducing agent, a negatively charged lipid abundant in late endosomes, cathepsins, or the cations Ca++ and K+ did not elicit detectable fusion. cathepsin B and L substrates (Z-Arg-Arg-7-AMC and Z-Phe-Arg-7-AMC, respectively) were from Calbiochem. delipidated BSA was a gift from David Castle (University of Virginia) two days after transfection, cells were replated in a 10cm2 dish and incubated with 500 g/ml of zeocin. surviving cells were then maintained in complete DMEM + 500 g/ml zeocin. the cells were individually picked and transferred to wells of a 24 well plate. mouse monoclonal antibody was from Sigma Aldrich. sheep--mouse-HRP, donkey--rabbit-HRP and streptavidin beads were from GE Healthcare. cells incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C after washing (3 times, PBS plus 0.1% Tween-20, 5 min per wash), secondary antibodies (-rabbit IR800, -mouse IR680 or -rat IR680, in blocking buffer with 0.2% Tween-20) after drying, plates were scanned (Licor Odyssey CLx near-infrared imaging system) cathepsins were pre-activated in preactivation buffer (100mM sodium acetate, 1mM EDTA, pH 4.5 containing fresh 5mM DTT) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the preactivated cathepsins were then diluted to 5g/ml in HMS fusion buffer at the indicated pH. after that, the pH was reneutralized and the cells were processed. a mixture of 5 M BMP and 5 M delipidated BSA was added to the cells in serum free DMEM for 5 min at 10\u00b0C. the cells were then rinsed with PBS and subjected to a pH pulse. the next day, to generate effector cells, cells were transfected with 1 g/well of glycoprotein plasmid. cells were infected with plasmid encoding EBOV-FL-GP, EBOV-21K-GP or LCMV-GP. cells were cleaved to 19K form of GP with 0.25 mg/ml freshly prepared thermolysin. COS7 cells were transfected to express membrane-anchored NPC1-C-loop and Firefly luciferase. the cells were chilled on ice for 15 min and incubated with EBOV-21K-GP, EBOV-19K-GP, or LCMV-GP VSV-luciferase (Renilla) pseudoviruses. after binding in the cold, a pH pulse was applied for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in HMS buffer biosafety All work with VSV pseudoviruses (encoding LCMV and EBOV GPs) and primate cells was performed at the Biosafety 2 level. chemicals, enzymes, cell cultures and media Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), phenol-red free DMEM, trypsin-EDTA 0.05%, phenol-red free trypsin-EDTA 0.5%. HEK293T/17 cells were a kind gift from Douglas DeSimone at the university of Virginia. hek293T/17 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% CCS. hek293T/17 cells were a kind gift from James Casanova at the university of Virginia. pFurin plasmid was a kind gift from Gary Thomas at the University of Pennsylvania. the pFurin plasmid was a kind gift from Juan de la Torre at the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. the sheep--mouse-HRP, the donkey--rabbit-HRP and the streptavidin magnetic sepharose beads were from GE Healthcare. the mouse -VSV-M antibody (23H2) was a gift from Michael Whitt. the plates incubated 1 h at RT and then washed 4 times in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. after drying, the plates were scanned (Licor Odyssey CLx near-infrared imaging system) red and green intensities (per well) were determined. a pH pulse was applied for 5 min at 37\u00b0C (unless otherwise stated) acetate, 1mM EDTA, pH 4.5 containing fresh 5mM DTT. preactivated cathepsins were then diluted to 5g/ml in HMS fusion buffer. the cells were then incubated at RT for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the pH was reneutralized and the cells were processed. HEK293T/17 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (6.75 x 105 cells/well) to generate effector cells expressing EBOV-21K-GP, LCMV- GP, or no viral glycoprotein (No GP) cells were transfected with 1 g/well of furin plasmid to generate the 21K form at the cell surface. BHK21 cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected with plasmid encoding EBOV-FL-GP, EBOV-21K-GP or LCMV-GP. an additional 6 g of plasmid encoding furin was transfected alongside cells transfected with EBOV-21K-GP. the next day, cells were infected with VSV-G helper virus encoding Renilla luciferase. ase (Renilla) pseudoviruses (at least 3 wells per sample) a pH pulse was applied for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in HMS buffer adjusted to the indicated pH value. the buffer was replaced with DMEM containing 40 mM NH4Cl. twenty-four hours later, luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) loop and low pH are not sufficient to trigger detectable fusion by GPcl NPC1 is the intracellular receptor for EBOV [8,9], and its luminally-oriented C-loop is sufficient to bind cathepsin-primed EBOV-GP (GPcl) if fusion occurs, the resulting luciferase/split GFP construct (DSP1-7 and DSP8-11, respectively) effector cells expressing GP from LCMV were used as a positive control. luciferase activity levels were comparable to those seen with effector cells harboring no GP. luciferase activity levels were comparable to those seen with effector cells harboring no GP. effector HEK293T/17 cells were transfected to express surface-directed NPC1-C-loop and labeled with DiI. cells were then cocultured for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, subjected to a 5-min pulse at the indicated pH (at 37\u00b0C) after 2 h, the cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. the cells were kept in NH4Cl, a lysosomotropic weak base that raises endosomal pH, to prevent fusion that might occur through the normal endocytic route. for these tests we used VSV pseudoviruses expressing 19 kDa and 21 kDa EBOV GP, as well as ones bearing 21 kDa EBOV GP. d at pH 5.0, 5.7 or 7.2 for 5 min at 37\u00b0C after which time the buffer was replaced with pH 7.4 medium containing 40 mM NH4Cl. after 24 h, cells were lysed and assessed for the ratio of Renilla luciferase (virus entry and replication) over firefly luciferase (total cells), as described in the Methods section. effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl showed apparently increased binding to cells that expressed NPC1 C-loop compared to those that did not express NPC1 C-loop at their surface. a lipid mixing signal was detected with effector cells expressing LCMV GP and treated at pH 5, no hemifusion signal above background was detected. hek293T/17 cells were prepared, treated and analyzed for CCF. pH pulse was done at either 37\u00b0C or 50\u00b0C. results represent mean +/- SD of triplicate samples from one of two experiments. temperatures as high as 50\u00b0C failed to induce GPcl to mediate CCF to target cells expressing NPC1 C-Loop at any pH tested. however, no CCF above background was seen with effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl in presence of 5 mM TCEP at any pH tested. a similar result was found using the FFPM assay (S4 Fig) as a fourth additional factor we tested whether the addition of cathepsins B and L could evoke the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl. the last additional factor we tested was the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate (BMP) NPC1-C-loop is sufficient for binding EBOV-GPcl and to promote entry and infection through endosomes. but other domains of NPC1 could be needed to trigger optimal fusion by GPcl. effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl at their surface do not support detectable fusion with cells expressing Ebola GPcl. as with its C-loop, full-length NPC1 did not elicit detectable content mixing CCF activity for EBOV-GPcl at any pH tested. LCMV-GP, again, induced robust CCF at low pH. beta-tubulin was used as a control for protein loading and cell intactness. results represent mean +/- SD of triplicate samples from one of two experiments. each sample was compared to the respective No GP sample ****p 0.0001. results represent mean +/- SD of triplicate samples from two experiments. for A and B each sample was compared to the pH 7.4 sample in each group and for C compared to the respective No GP sample. effector cells expressing full-length EBOV-GP were used as a positive control. effector cells expressed one half of a split luciferase/split GFP construct. luciferase activity levels were comparable to those seen with effector cells harboring no GP. effector HEK293T/17 cells were transfected to express LCMV-GP, EBOV-21K-GP or No GP and DSP1-7. effector and target cells were cocultured for 3 h, subjected to a 5-min pulse at the indicated pH at 37\u00b0C. after 1 h, luciferase activity was measured as described in the Methods section. VSV pseudoviruses encoding Renilla luciferase and expressing GPcl were bound to target cells expressing NPC1 C-Loop at their surface. cells with bound pseudoviruses were then briefly pulsed at 4\u00b0C. after the pH pulse, the cells were kept in NH4Cl, a lysosomotropic weak base that raises endosomal pH. VSV pseudoviruses bearing the indicated GP were bound at 4\u00b0C to target (COS7) cells with (+) or without (-) NPC1-C-loop at their surface that had been pre-cooled. the cells were then pulsed at pH 5.0, 5.7 or 7.2 for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h, cells were lysed and assessed for the ratio of Renilla luciferase (virus entry and replication) over firefly luci effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl and labeled with the fluorescent lipid probe DiO are mixed with target cells expressing NPC1 C-loop. a lipid mixing signal was detected with effector cells expressing LCMV GP and treated at pH 5. no hemifusion signal above background was detected for effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl. we used the sensitive split luciferase CCF assay. in each experiment we included effector cells expressing LCMV GP as a positive control for CCF. Elevated temperature and reducing conditions do not trigger detectable fusion. psin B and 5 g/ml of cathepsin L were prepared as described in the legend to Fig 1A. effector cells were treated with an equimolar mixture of 5 M BMP and delipidated BSA for 5 min at 10\u00b0C. then subjected to a 5 min pulse at 37\u00b0C at the indicated pH. the third additional factor we tested was cations, specifically Ca++ and K+. EBOV entry requires an endosomal calcium channel [25] and the glycoproteins of Rubella [38], Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to require Ca++ for optimal functioning. full length NPC1, low pH and additional factors tested are not sufficient to trigger detectable fusion by GPcl. however, other domains of NPC1 could be needed to trigger optimal EBOV GPcl-mediated fusion. we therefore asked if full-length NPC1 could induce fusion activity of EBOV-GPcl. a substantial amount of NPC1 was found at the cell surface, as detected by cell surface biotinylation. cells transiently expressing full length NPC1 at their surface were then tested as targets in the split luciferase CCF assay. however, as with its C-loop, full-length NPC1 did not elicit detectable content mixing CCF activity for EBOV-GPcl at any pH tested. effector and target cells were analyzed for surface exposed EBOV-GP1 and NPC1 following surface biotinylation, avidin precipitation and blotting for EBOV GP or NPC1. cocultures of effector and target cells were then treated for CCF and analyzed as in Fig 1A. effector cells expressing full length NPC1 at the cell surface were prepared as described in the legend to Fig 5B. the target cells were then treated with (A) Ca++ or K+, (B) cathepsins or (C) BMP as described in the legend to Fig 3A, 3B and 3C. the conditions that elicit the fusion activity of the viral fusion GP have been debated. we re-examined the sufficiency of NPC1 to trigger the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl. we found that cells expressing either NPC1-C-Loop or full length NPC1 at their surface did not serve as adequate targets for detectable fusion. this apparent insufficiency was seen even if effector-target cell pairs were additionally exposed to elevated temperature, a reducing agent. small non-expanding fusion pores reported by Markosyan et al. [26] would likely not lead to productive viral infection, being too small to pass a viral nucleocapsid. this conclusion is consistent with x-ray analysis of the GPcl-NPC1-C-loop complex, indicating that only small, but likely important, conformational changes occur when EBOV GPcl binds to NPC1-C-Loop we favor the hypothesis that the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl requires NPC1 and a yet to be identified, likely endosomal, factor. the initial observation indicating a need for an additional factor was that pseudovirus particles bearing 19 kDa EBOV GP are not infectious if target cells are pretreated. the plasma membrane may contain a lipid or protein factor that is inhibitory to EBOV GPcl-mediated fusion. the plasma membrane may contain a lipid or protein factor that is inhibitory to EBOV GPcl-mediated fusion. another possibility is that an additional membrane protein, for example TPC2, is required. future studies are aimed at identifying the putative missing factor(s) and testing other filoviral GPs that may be more prone to fusion. effectsor (A) and target (B) cells used for fusion experiments were biotinylated and analyzed for surface exposed EBOV-GP1 (A) or NPC1-C-loop (B) GP, EBOV GPCL (19kDa form), or full-length EBOV GP to target cells expressing membrane-anchored NPC1-C-loop. data in A are the averages of triplicate samples (+/- SD) from one experiment. data in B are the averages of triplicate samples from one experiment. the cells were lysed and assessed for the ratio of Renilla luciferase activity (virus replication) over firefly luciferase activity (number of cells) at this time, equal inputs of the pseudoviruses used in (A) were added to cells, either mock-treated or pre-treated with 40 mM NH4Cl, and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. 4B and 6B statistics are based on Student\u2019s t-test."}
