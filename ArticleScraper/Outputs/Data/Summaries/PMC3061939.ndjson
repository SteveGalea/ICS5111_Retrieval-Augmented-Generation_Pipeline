{"summary": "Background Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) belongs to the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae. virulent strains cause severe disease in pigs characterized by immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. virulent strains of classical swine fever virus cause severe disease in pigs. diseased animals show hemorrhages in the skin, mucosa and internal organs. a general immunosuppression featuring a dramatic decrease of peripheral B- and T-cells early after infection of CSFV. studies have shown that cytokines released from monocytes/macrophages activated by the virus may play a critical role in the induction of immune cell apoptosis. proteomic analysis of serum protein profile of CSFV-infected pigs and uninfected controls. alterations of protein expression in serum were characterized by two-dimension differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) followed by MALDI-TOF MS or LTQ MS. a total of 10 differentialy expressed protein spots have been successfully identified. proteins with at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration in expression in serum from CSFV-infected pigs measured by 2-D DIGE and MALDI-ToF MS analysis Spotno.a Identified proteins GI no.b Ratio (I/U)c MMd (kDa)/pI M/Se Seq Cov (%)f Scoreh t-tes P value 632 similar to RNA binding motif protein 15B gi| 12633 GI no. is SEQUEST results of LTQ MS from the NCBI Suina database. 10 of these 17 differentially expressed protein spots were unambiguously identified by using MALDI-TOF MS or Finnigan LTQ MS (Figure 2, tables 1 and 2). the arithmetic mean of the standardized spot abundances is indicated by the symbol +. for each group (control and CSFV-infected pigs), the arithmetic mean of the standardized spot abundances is indicated by the symbol. measured by 2-D DIGE and MALDI-ToF MS analysis Spotno.a Identified proteins GI no.b Ratio (I/U)c MMd (kDa)/pI M/Se Seq Cov (%)f Scoreh t-tes P value 632 similar to RNA binding motif protein 15B gi| 126336349 -2.1 99/9.9 7/12 9 71 0.004 636 serotransferrin MMc/pI Ratio (I/U)d Coverage percent(%)e t-test P value 829 serotransferrin gi|136192 77/6.9 1.7 4.02 0.009 847 complement c4 gi|38455780 58/6.0 -1.75 9.86 0.004 1040 apolipoprotein A-I gi|1892 19/7.1 -1.80 11.59 0.002 1105 hap 2-D DIGE is a fluorescence-based technique for protein visualization and quantification. a total of 10 protein spots of all 17 differentially expressed protein spots were successfully identified by MS. the remaining 7 protein spots were not identified successfully. Thrombin inhibitor is a potent inhibitor of thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. it is capable of antagonizing host hemostasis and facilitating blood feeding. down-regulation of apo A-I may affect vascular endothelium repair and inflammatory inhibition. retinol-binding protein is a biomarker of acute kidney injury. it is known that CSFV infection may cause kidney petechial bleeding. upregulation of retinol-binding protein (VDBP) in pigs may be involved in kidney injury. serum proteins preparation Ten 60-day-old Landrace pigs were used. five pigs were injected intramuscularly with a lethal dose of highly virulent strain Shimen using a previous protocol. ourea, 62 mM Tris, 4%CHAPS, 0.2% IPG buffer, PH8.8) serum samples were labeled with cyanine dyes. 50 g of serum samples were minimally labeled with 400 pmol CyDye. all strips were loaded on 12.5% homogeneous SDS polyacrylamide gels. the second-dimensional separation was performed at 20\u00b0C at a constant current of 15 mA/gel for 30 min, then 30 mA/gel until the dye reached the bottom of the gel. Q MS (ThermoQuest) coupled with a Surveyor HPLC system (ThermoQuest) the peptide powders were re-dissolved in 5 l 0.1% TFA. one l of supernatant was spotted on anchorChip targets (Bruker Daltonics) and then mixed with 0.5 l matrix solution. a relative molecular mass of 57 Da was added to the average molecular mass of cysteines in the database search. both b ions and y ions were included in the database search. all pigs were free from CSFV infection, as validated by using a protocol described by Shi et al. serum samples were diluted to give stock solutions with final protein concentrations of about 5 mg/mL. equal volumes of serum from each infected pig and control pigs were mixed as an internal standard. serum samples were labeled with cyanine dyes. a trace of bromophenol blue was then loaded on 12.5% homogeneous SDS polyacrylamide gels. the second-dimensional separation was performed at 20\u00b0C at a constant current of 15 mA/gel for 30 min, then 30 mA/gel until the dye reached the bottom of the gel in the Ettan DALT Six System. peptide extracts were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS or Finnigan LTQ MS. peptide powders were re-dissolved in 5 l 0.1% TFA. one l of supernatant was spotted on anchorChip targets. the peptides were eluted from the C18 microcapillary column at a flow rate of 150 l per min. the peptides were then electrosprayed directly into a mass spectrometer (spray voltage 3.2 KV) the full scan range was from M/Z 400 to 2000. this work was supported by national \"973\" program (Grant No. 2005CB523200), national key technology R&D program (Grant no. 2006BAD06A03) and Ph.D Initiatory Fund of Liaoning Province (Grant no. 20091028)"}
