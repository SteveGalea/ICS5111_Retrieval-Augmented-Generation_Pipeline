{"summary": "scFvFc human antibodies were fused in frame with different transmembrane moieties to allow efficient high-level expression on human cells and lentivirus particles. both antibody-displaying human cells and virus particles bound antigen specifically. sulfation of tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. the mAb based immunotherapies are now standard of care in an increasing number of human cancers. since 2001, human mAbs developed through recombinant DNA techniques have constituted the largest number entering clinical study [1], [6], [7]. this shift, toward de novo human mAb isolation and their clinical use, is in part due to new antibody display and other library screening techniques. sulfation of tyrosine residues in the CDR residues of human antibodies can affect antigen recognition [15], [16] and contribute bidirectionally to the binding activity of antibodies [17]. scFvFc displaying human cells could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity. cFvFc protein was fused to a transmembrane (TM) moiety. all anchoring moieties consist of a short extracellular region, an entire TM domain and a cytoplasmic tail. eight residues of the most membrane-proximal HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail were also tested. the most membrane-proximal 12 residues of the extracellular domain (solid green) and 11 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (green vertical stripes) flank 21 residues of the TM region (horizontal purple stripes) an extracellular region consisting of 40 residues (solid purple) and a cytoplasmic region of 13 residues (purple vertical stripes) flank the 27-residue TM domain (horizontal purple stripes) 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1 based constructs encoding PS11-scFvFc antibodies of different configurations. pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. image a, cells transfected with ZsGreen only vector; Images b and c, cells transfected with vectors expressing either PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665\u2013856)-IRES ZsGreen or PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713)-IRES-ZsGreen. absence of the ZsGreen fluorescence in some of the APC+ cells is likely the result of low level expression of c-gp41 (665\u2013856) showed punctate staining with large aggregates. reticular staining pattern consistent with efficient ER folding and expression. rhodamine conjugated anti-human Fc staining was not detected on cells transfected with ZsGreen encoding vector alone. [17] showed only a relatively low level of APC-streptavidin staining (lane 4) the PS11-scFvFc-CD8-gp41 and PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 proteins were the most competent in binding the peptide. this result suggests that this motif may stabilize surface antibody expression, by promoting its proper folding and membrane association. sulfation occurs in selected surface displayed scFvFc antibodies. tyrosine sulfation occurs in novel areas of the V-region genes. sulfation occurs in novel areas of the V-region genes. unoprecipitation studies confirmed that sulfation occurred in the surface displayed X20-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 but not with X48-scFvFc-CD28-gp41. treatment of transfected cells with sodium-chlorate decreased expression but more significantly abolished sulfation of scFvFc proteins. sulfation was mapped to tyrosine in VH CDR scFvFc-TM was first examined by western blot analysis of equal amounts of viral particles. both PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713) and PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713) were detected in purified viral particles. a control CMV-GFP lentivirus showed no reactivity. cells were stained with anti-HIV p24 antibody followed by a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human Fc for surface Fc staining. shown separately are viruses stained for detection of p24 and scFvFc along with a merged image. ining profiles confirmed co-localization of the core with scFvFc. control CMV-GFP viral particles stained positively with anti-p24 antibody only. scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713) proteins are displayed on the surface of lentivirus and remain functional. at MOI of 1, there was about 5000\u20138000 of PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 surface expressed molecules per transduced human cell. transduced cells were harvested, stained for Fc-surface expression. expression of scFvFc was measured to monitor levels of transduction. two clusters of cells in Panel c represent high (R2 gated) and low (R3 gated) levels of 11A-scFvFc on their surface as measured by APC staining. these could reflect variations in cell-surface expression levels resulting from multiple integration events of the scFvFc cassette following transduction. 37% of cells transduced with the X48-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen lentivirus stained positive with streptavidin-APC. contrast, only background staining was detected when the same transduced cells were incubated with biotinylated GD03-Fc protein. 11A- and PS11-scFvFc cells were mixed at different ratios. incubated with a fixed concentration of biotin-GD03-Fc protein and streptavidin-APC. an enrichment step, using MACS-anti-APC microbeads, was performed. 293T cells were transduced with either PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen or 11A-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen encoding lentiviruses. mixed cells were incubated with biotinylated GD03-Fc protein antigen and APC-streptavidin. DNA sequencing results of individual clones recovered from different 11APS11 scFvFc expressing cell ratios (1103\u20131106) Neutralization of infection mediated by cell-surface displayed scFvFc It was next determined if transduced human cells expressing the unique surface anchored scFvFc could be used directly in a biological screen. TOR2 spike protein pseudotyped luciferase expressing lentiviral particles were incubated with increasing concentrations of 293T cells expressing on their surface the 80R scFvFc. as a control for non-specific reporter virus absorption, a VSV-G pseudotyped luciferase reporter lentivirus was also incubated with 80R scFvFc expressing cells (brown square) all anchoring moieties consist of a short extracellular region, an entire TM domain and a cytoplasmic tail. eight residues of the most membrane-proximal HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail were also tested for their ability to promote efficient pseudotyping of the scFvFc. the most membrane-proximal 12 residues of the extracellular domain (solid green) and 11 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (green vertical stripes) flank 21 residues of the TM region (horizontal purple stripes) for CD28, an extracellular region consisting of 40 residues (solid purple) and a cytoplasmic region of 13 residues (purple vertical stripes) flank the 27-residue TM domain (horizontal purple stripes) 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1 based constructs encoding PS11-scFvFc antibodies of different configurations. pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. cells were stained with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human Fc. images a, cells transfected with ZsGreen only vector; Images b and c, cells transfected with vectors expressing either PS11-scFvFc-gp41 or PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713)-IRES-ZsGreen. cells expressing PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665\u2013856) showed punctate staining with large aggregates. in contrast, PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 proteins were evenly distributed on the cell surface. rhodamine conjugated anti-human Fc staining was not detected on cells transfected with ZsGreen encoding vector alone (image a) inylated CXCR4 peptide showed only a relatively low level of APC-streptavidin staining (lane 4) the inylated peptide exhibited higher levels of peptide binding compared to the corresponding constructs without the envelope incorporation motifs. this result suggests that this motif may stabilize surface antibody expression, by promoting its proper folding and membrane association. panel a and b depict the percentage of positive cells that express a functional PS11 scFvFc as determined by staining with streptavidin-APC (Panel a) Error bars represent the standard deviation of the average of three experiments. radioimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed that sulfation occurred in the surface displayed X20-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 but not with X48-scFvFc-CD28-gp41. treatment of transfected cells with sodium-chlorate decreased expression but more significantly abolished sulfation of scFvFc proteins. sulfation was mapped to tyrosine in V scFvFc-TM was first examined by western blot analysis of equal amounts of viral particles. both PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 and PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706\u2013713) were detected in the purified viral particles. a control CMV-GFP lentivirus showed no reactivity (upper lane 1). cells were attached to Hela cells for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. cells were stained with anti-HIV p24 antibody followed by Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human Fc for surface Fc staining. shown separately are viruses stained for detection of p24 and scFvFc. scFvFc-CD28-gp41 proteins stained positively with anti-p24 antibody. scFvFc-CD28-gp41 proteins are displayed on the surface of lentivirus. a virion capture experiment was performed. cell-surface expression of scFvFc was detectable at very low multiplicity of infection. at MOI of 1, there was about 5000\u20138000 of PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 surface expressed molecules per transduced human cell. transduced cells were harvested, stained for Fc-surface expression. two clusters of cells in Panel c represent high (R2 gated) and low (R3 gated) levels of 11A-scFvFc on their surface as measured by APC staining. these could reflect variations in cell-surface expression levels resulting from multiple integration events of the scFvFc cassette following transduction. 37% of cells transduced with the X48-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen lentivirus stained positive with streptavidin-APC. contrast, only background staining was detected when the same transduced cells were incubated with biotinylated GD03-Fc protein. 11A- and PS11-scFvFc cells were pre-sorted for ZsGreen expression soon after transduction. Upon further propagation, 11A- and PS11-scFvFc cells were mixed at different ratios. an enrichment step, using MACS-anti-APC microbeads, was performed prior to FACS analysis and sorting of streptavidin-APC positive cells. 293T cells were transduced with either PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen or 11A-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen encoding lentiviruses. mixed cells were incubated with the biotinylated GD03-Fc protein antigen and APC-streptavidin. cell population (initial mixing ratio at 1106), magnetic beads enrichment (middle panel), and the R2 gated cells after sorting and expansion (middle panel) DNA sequencing results of individual clones recovered from different 11APS11 scFvFc expressing cell ratios (1103\u20131106) single round, TOR2 spike protein pseudotyped luciferase expressing lentiviral particles were incubated with increasing concentrations of 293T cells expressing on their surface the 80R scFvFc (blue diamond) as a control for non-specific reporter virus absorption, a VSV-G pseudotyped luciferase reporter lentivirus was also incubated with 80R scFvFc expressing cells. transduction of human cells with a self-inactivating, bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding scFvFc-CD28-gp41 and ZsGreen proteins resulted in a 106-fold enrichment of specific antibody expressing cells in one single tandem, two-step procedure. in the scFv gene PCR rescue experiment described in Figure 6b, only one week of cell propagation was used. the endogenous biochemical pathways that are responsible for hypermutation of antibodies are constitutively expressed in human B-cells [11], [12] and/or can be further manipulated in an inducible manner through retroviral gene transfer [26], [27] thus, affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation of displayed antibodies may be possible. lentiviral display system should complement existing antibody display technologies by virtue of providing properties unique to antibody expression in human cells. as few as 320 scFvFc expressing cells could be detected with as few as 320 scFvFc expressing cells. transduced cells expressing bivalent surface displayed antibodies may mediate cross-linking of antigen molecules expressed on the surface of human target cells following co-incubation. this could provide an early and direct screen to interrogate the desired biological activity of the antibodies without the need to initiate costly soluble antibody production and purification procedures. scFv antibodies used in this study were originally derived from the mehta I/II non-immune human scFv-phage libraries. they were cloned into a pcDNA 3.1-based expression vector as an Sfi-I/Not-I 856 bp insert, and fused in frame with a human Fc-region (hinge-CH2-CH3) that had been amplified by PCR. 5105 293T cells were harvested using 5 mM EDTA at 48 hour post transfection. cells were washed 3 times with PBS+2% BSA and analyzed by FACS. transfection efficiency of each sample was verified through GFP expression and analyzed concurrently by FACS. vFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen, PS11-scFvFc-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen or CMV-ZsGreen plasmids were negative control for cells that do not express scFvFc on their surface. samples were fixed with 3.9% paraformaldehyde (SIGMA) for 30 minutes, followed by washing once with PBS and permeabilization with PBS/0.05% sapon scFvFc-TM/VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviruses and 293T cells stably expressing scFvFc-TM through lentiviral transduction A self-inactivating pHAGE lentivector (a gift from R. Mulligan) was modified to accommodate subcloning of Sfi-I/Pac-I scFvFc-TM DNA fragments. 5106 293T cells were seeded on 100 mm diameter plates. they were co-transfected the next day with 10 g of the pHAGE lentivector. supernatant was concentrated by centrifugation (21,000 rpm; 15 minutes) and sterile filtered through 0.45 m filter. biotinylated peptide or protein antigens used for specific antibody binding analysis are described in the figure legends. a 96-well plate was coated with different antigens overnight at 4\u00b0C. wells were then washed 5 times with 200 l PBS. immunofluorescence of pseudotyped viruses Hela cells grown overnight on 12 mm cover-slips were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes with media containing 10 mM HEPES, pH-8.0. samples were fixed with 3.9% paraformaldehyde (SIGMA) for 30 minutes, followed by another wash in PBS and permeabilization with PBS 0.05% saponin (SIGMA) for 30 minutes. the \"Quantum Simply cellular anti-mouse IgG kit\" was used. cells expressing on their surface the scFvFc with a C9 tag were incubated with 10 g of an APC conjugated mouse anti-C9 monoclonal antibody 1D4. both cells and calibration beads were analyzed for APC staining intensity by FACS. 2% BSA for 30 minutes followed by staining with biotinylated GD03-Fc. cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and stained with streptavidin-APC in PBS/2% BSA. cells were then labeled with MACS-anti-APC magnetic beads. 80R scFvFc spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes with increasing concentrations of 293T cells expressing on their surface the anti-TOR2 spike 80R-scFvFc. both 80R- and PS11-scFvFc surface-expressing cells were also incubated with VSV-G pseudotyped viral particles. pCDNA 3.1-PS11-scFvFc expression vector was cloned, in-frame, as Xba-I/Pac-I digested PCR fragments. a C9 sequence [34] was inserted N-terminus of all TM domains. transfected cells were co-transfected with 4 g of each plasmids DNA. 293T cells were transfected with DNA encoding for a PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen, PS11-scFvFc-gp41-IRES-ZsGreen or CMV-ZsGreen plasmids. the latter served as a negative control for cells that do not express scFvFc on their surface. at 48 hours post transfection, samples were fixed with 3.9% 293T cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 expression plasmids using lipofectamine 2000. cells were washed and mounted for flurescence microscopy by using ProLong antifade kit (Invitrogen) scFvFc-TM/VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviruses and 293T cells stably expressing scFvFc-TM through lentiviral transduction A self-inactivating pHAGE lentivector was modified to accommodate subcloning of scFvFc-TM. it expresses the Zoanthus Green Fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) gene via an IRES sequence. viral supernatant was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (21,000 rpm; 2 hours) through a 20% sucrose cushion, aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. the titer of the pseudotyped virus particles was evaluated either by RT assay or by transduction of HeLa cells with increasing dilutions of the lentivirus stock. lentiviruses were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM PMSF; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM NP-40; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) reverse transcription analysis was performed on eluted particles. samples were then incubated with either a mouse anti-p24 antibody (AG3.0; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) or with an anti-human Fc-rhodamine antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour. samples were then washed and incubated with Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for an additional hour. lentiviruses were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM PMSF; 1 mM EDTA; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and proteins were probed with a mouse anti HIV-1-p24-HRP antibody (Immuno-Diagnostics) odamine antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour. cells were then washed and incubated with Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. samples were mounted for fluorescence microscopy by using a confocal microscope. 293T cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding either 11A scFvFc or PS11 scFvFc. total mixed cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 30 minutes. cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and stained with streptavidin-APC in PBS/2% BSA. 293T cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding either 11A scFvFc or PS11 scFvFc at MOI of one. total mixed cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 30 minutes. cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and stained with streptavidin-APC. cells were washed and re-suspended in 500 l PBS buffer containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. cells were then labeled with MACS-anti-APC magnetic beads. cells were then cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector. both 80R- and PS11-scFvFc surface-expressing cells were also incubated with viral particles. viral supernatant was used to infect 293T cells expressing the ACE2 receptor."}
