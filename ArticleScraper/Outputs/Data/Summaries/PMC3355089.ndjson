{"summary": "ubiquitination of target cell surface membrane proteins triggers its internalization and endocytic sorting. monoubiquitination of single ubiquitin moieties induces its internalization and transport to the lysosome for degradation. ubiquitination of membrane receptors 2 adrenergic receptor and interleukin 2 receptor chain is required for correct internalization and processing. the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the internalization of KSHV and its cognate receptor(s) has yet to be examined. in this study, we investigated the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the entry and intracellular trafficking of KSHV. ubiquitination is required for KSHV entry into endothelial cells and during its endosomal sorting and intracellular trafficking. primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with chemical inhibitors of the 26S proteasome, MG132 or epoxomicin (ePOX) for 1 hr prior to KSHV infection. inhibition of proteasome function significantly reduced the numbers of LANA-positive cells at 48 hpi. at the highest used doses of MG132 (96 g/ml) and EPOX (500 nM), LANA-positive cells were reduced from 96.86% of the untreated cells to 0% and 3.49%. these results indicate that proteasome activity is necessary for successful KSHV intracellular trafficking to the nuclei. cells were fixed and stained for LANA (red) and nuclei (blue) at 48 hpi. open boxes indicate the 75th and 25th percentiles. middle lines indicate the medians, also shown in \u201c%\u201d on tops. a greater proportion of viral particles were retained in the cytoplasm in the proteasome-inhibited cells compared to untreated cells. as expected, fewer viral particles reached the nuclear membrane (Figure 3F) the percentages of internalized KSHV particles in the cytoplasmic space are shown in (D) and the percentages of internalized KSHV particles docked at the nuclei are shown in (F). the increased number of viral particles in the cytoplasm suggests inhibition of proteasome activity might lead to an arrest in the maturation of viral particle-containing endosomes. HUVEC treated with DMSO, MG132 or EPOX were incubated with KSHV for 4 hr, stained for viral particles (red), EEA1 (green), membrane (white) and nuclei (blue) Imaris image analysis software was used to generate 3-D contoured images. 3-D colocalization analyses determine the total number of KSHV particles in a cell that are colocalized with LAMP1 (B), the numbers of viral particles localized at cell membranes that are LAMP1+ (C) and the numbers of viral particles localized within the cytoplasmic spaces that are LAMP1+ (D) clathrin-coated pits mediates internalization through endocytosis [21]. endocytic adaptor proteins such as Epsin and Eps15 may play an important role during KSHV entry. most KSHV particles were colocalized with both Epsin and Eps15 during infection of HUVEC. cell lysates were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect both low molecular weight free ubiquitin as well as ubiquitinated proteins. -actin was used as a loading control (bottom panel) the shorter exposure shown at the right panel was used to illustrate relative levels of ubiquitinated proteins. inhibition of proteasome function depletes the cellular pool of free ubiquitin. 3-D colocalization analysis revealed significant levels of colocalization between KSHV particles with integrin 1. less than 10% of RRV, transferrin or cholera toxin B was colocalized with integrin 1. HUVEC were pretreated for 1 hr with DMSO (C) or UBEI-41 (D) for 1 hr. they were labeled with a monoclonal antibody to integrin 1 for 1 hr. inhibition of E1 activating enzyme reduces KSHV entry. integrin 1 internalized and localized to the perinuclear region in untreated cells. after treatment with UBEI-41, it was retained at the plasma membrane. this suggests integrin 1 internalization requires ubiquitination. inhibition of E1 activating enzyme and ubiquitination reduced the number of viral particles that successfully entered the cells. c-Cbl is activated through phosphorylation by the Src family kinases at tyrosine residues 700, 731, and 774 [34]\u2013[36]. c-Cbl is activated through phosphorylation by the Src family kinases principally at tyrosine residues 700, 731, and 774 [34]\u2013[36]. thus, only a minimal amount of KSHV particles (6%) were colocal c-Cbl, phospho-Y700 c-Cbl and phospho-Y774 c-Cbl were colocalized with the Imaris software. Knock-down of c-Cbl had no effect on KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking. knock-down of c-Cbl but not Rabex-5 abolished KSHV infectivity. cells stained for Orf65+ viral particles (red) and nuclei (blue) Knock-down with c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of KSHV particles successfully docked at perinuclear regions. c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of LANA-positive cells. HUVEC pretreated with PP1 analog for 1 hr, infected with KSHV for 4 hr. treatment with PP1 analog prevents phosphorylation of c-Cbl. phosphorylation modifications were abrogated in presence of PP1 analog. MG132 is a peptide aldehyde that potently inhibits the transition state of the proteasome. ePOX selectively and irreversibly binds to the catalytic subunits of the proteasome and effectively inhibits multiple proteolytic activities. at 4 hr post-infection, the total numbers of viral particles docked at each nucleus or in a whole cell revealed by staining for small capsid protein Orf65 were quant inhibition of proteasome activity prevents KSHV entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to nuclei. cells were then infected with KSHV in the presence of the inhibitors. n represents total number of fields analyzed per sample. p-values 0.05 are statistically significant. we next sought to identify where viral particles were trapped. three-dimensional contoured images were generated using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. 3-D images in the upper panels were rotated on the x-axis to visualize viral particles attached at the cell membrane. video S4 depicts viral particles that have been engulfed, and are enclosed within a membrane-bound vesicle. increased number of viral particles in the cytoplasm suggests proteasome inhibition may lead to an arrest in the maturation of viral particles-containing endosomes. proteasome inhibition resulted in more viral particles colocalized with the early endosome marker, EEA1 in the entire cells. Imaris image analysis software was used to generate 3-D contoured images. videos S5, S6 and S7 correspond to cells treated with DMSO, MG132 or EPOX. Imaris 3-D colocalization analyses determine the total numbers of KSHV particles in a cell that are colocalized with EEA1 (B), the numbers of viral particles localized at cell membranes that are EEA1+ (C) particles localized at cell membranes that are LAMP1+ (C) and viral particles localized within the cytoplasmic spaces that are LAMP1+ (D). endocytic adaptor proteins such as Epsin and Eps15 may play an important role during KSHV entry. the detection of non-colocalized particles indicates that the observed colocalization is specific but not due to random distribution of the viral particles. results suggest that KSHV utilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells. either KSHV or its receptor(s) is subjected to ubiquitination during the viral internalization process. inhibition of proteasome function results in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and thus a reduction in the cellular pool of ubiquitin monomers available for de novo ubiquitination reactions. to test this, we treated endothelial cells with either MG132 or EPOX for 1 hr. less than 10% of RRV, transferrin or cholera toxin B was colocalized with integrin 1. HUVEC infected with KSHV were stained for viral particles (red) and integrin 1 (white) images were subjected to 3-D colocalization analysis. integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins composed of and chains. ubiquitination regulates the internalization of integrin 1 and KSHV. treatment with UBEI-41 abolished the level of ubiquitinated integrin 1. inhibition of E1 activating enzyme and ubiquitination reduced the number of viral particles that successfully entered the cells and trafficked to the nuclei. however, UBEI-41 had no detectable effect on the total numbers of viral particles per cell including those associated with plasma membrane. PI staining did not detect any cytotoxicity to the cells at all the concentrations used. bl are candidate E3 ligases that may mediate KSHV internalization. only a minimal amount of KSHV particles (6%) were colocalized with Rabex5 during KSHV infection. a significant fraction of KSHV particles (70%) were colocalized with c-Cbl. knock-down of c-Cbl but not Rabex-5 abolished KSHV infectivity. knock-down of c-Cbl inhibits KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking. c-Cbl, Rabex-5 or control shRNA lentivirus particles for 4 days. at 48 hpi, cells were stained for LANA (red) and nuclei (blue) c-Cbl shRNA but not Rabex-5 shRNA or control shRNA decreased the numbers of LANA-positive cells. treatment of HUVEC with increasing doses of PP1 analog inhibited viral entry and intracellular trafficking. HUVEC pretreated with PP1 analog for 1 hr, infected with KSHV for 4 hr. treatment with PP1 analog prevents phosphorylation of c-Cbl during KSHV infection. cells treated with proteasome inhibitors had higher numbers of EEA1+ particles at the membrane and higher numbers of EEA1+ particles in the cytoplasm. proteasome inhibition reduced the total number of KSHV particles in the LAMP1+ late endosome/lysosome compartments. integrins are heterodimers composed of and subunits. integrin 1 is targeted for ubiquitination following inoculation with KSHV. ubiquitination itself directly mediates viral entry and trafficking. ubiquitination may be required for the initial steps of internalization from the plasma membrane and maturation of the early endosome. further studies should delineate the possible roles for ubiquitination during post-early endosome stages. we have examined E3 ligases that mediate KSHV internalization and maturation of KSHV-containing endosomes. knock-down of c-Cbl significantly inhibited viral entry and intracellular trafficking. c-Cbl inhibition did in fact prevent phosphorylation of c-Cbl at tyrosine residues 700 and 774 during KSHV infection. the same group also investigated the ubiquitination of myosin IIA during KSHV infection, and found that c-Cbl may be mediating the formation of membrane blebs through its E3 KSHV-infected iSLK cells established from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a PEL patient were maintained in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells grown to log-phase were serum-starved overnight in RPMI1640. all the procedures for virus concentration were carried out at 4\u00b0C. cells were pretreated with the inhibitors in EBM-2 media for 1 hr prior to infection. cells were then inoculated with the virus preparation and incubated for indicated times in presence of the inhibitors. mouse IgG1, AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, and AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-rat were from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) DAPI was from BioChemika Ultra, Sigma. chemical inhibitors of proteasome function MG132 and EPOX were purchased from Sigma. images were acquired using an Olympus FV1000 scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60 NA 1.42 oil immersion objective. images were acquired for at least 5 fields of view per coverslip to allow counting of Orf65+ viral particles docked at nuclei. the red channel (Orf65) was masked to create a new channel that encapsulates the 500 nm region of the image around the center of each viral particle. the masked channel was then used to determine viral particle colocalization with each of the endosomal markers (EEA1 or LAMP1) as well as for epsin, eps15, Rabex-5, c-Cbl, Y700-c-Cbl, and Y cells treated with 100 ng/ml EGF were included as a positive control for c-Cbl phosphorylation. lysates were pre-cleared with protein G beads for 1 hr and incubated with mouse anti-integrin 1 for 2 hr. cells bearing a minimum of five viral particles per cell were included in the analysis. outliers outside the 90th and 10th percentiles are represented as black dots. culture medium was centrifuged at 5,000 g for 30 min to eliminate cell debris. centrifugation at 100,000 g for 3 h followed by centrifugation. undissolved debris was eliminated by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min. all the procedures for virus concentration were carried out at 4\u00b0C. mouse monoclonal antibodies to cbl and Rabex-5 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were also used for Western-blot detection. rat anti-LANA monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz. cells were incubated with each primary antibody for 1 hr and then the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 647 (Invitrogen) after washing with PBS, cells were stained with DAPI and mounted onto glass slides with FluorSave (Invitrogen) images were acquired for at least 5 fields of view per coverslip to allow counting of Orf65+ viral particles docked at nuclei. three-Dimensional Colocalization Analysis Z-stack images were first deconvolved with AutoQuant software using the adaptive point spread function. the threshold for each channel was automatically calculated by the program using the Pearson's coefficient approach. lysates were pre-cleared with protein G beads for 1 hr and incubated with mouse anti-integrin 1 for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. the protein G beads were used to precipitate the immune complexes. data were analyzed using t-test, analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests where appropriate. cells bearing a minimum of five viral particles per cell were included in the analysis. to detect colocalization or transferrin or cholera toxin B with integrin 1 cells were stained for integrin 1 (green) and nuclei (blue) images were subjected to colocalization analysis. figures were acquired and used for colocalization analysis.
