{"summary": "some island nations have explicit components of their influenza pandemic plans for providing travel warnings and restricting incoming travellers. but the potential value of such restrictions has not been quantified. the total number of travellers during the pandemic must not exceed 115 (for R0 = 3.0) or 380 (for R0 = 1.5) some island nations have explicit components of their influenza pandemic plans for providing travel warnings and restricting incoming travellers. some modelling work suggests that international air travel restrictions may contribute to delaying the spread of a pandemic. a global pandemic would spread around the world via aircraft travel. model for global pandemic were based on the published model InfluSim [8]. only 50% of \"moderately sick\" cases were assumed to be well enough to travel. assumptions are likely to be very conservative as they assume no exit screening. a given number of infected individuals enter the island during the global pandemic. the expected number of secondary cases per index case varies. we combine all possible events to calculate the probability that an island will either experience a major outbreak or ultimately escape the pandemic. assumptions on travel reductions We assumed that voluntary travel reductions might be similar to those experienced during SARS for travel between Hong Kong and the united states at 79% [9]. 99% were assumed to relate to restrictions imposed by governments of island nations and to reflect essential diplomatic and emergency travel only. for more severe pandemics, only four to five PICTs would have more than 50% probability of escaping. only one country (Tuvalu) was considered to have a high chance of escaping a relatively \"mild\" pandemic by relying on voluntary travel volume reductions. the coding of the island escape probability: standard type, 10%; italics, 10 - 50%; bold, > 50%; bold, > 50%. figures include arrivals by sea (4.4% of total visitor arrivals) for vanuatu this figure includes day visitors from ships (n = 85,922) for tonga this figure includes an estimate for returning residents and arrivals by ship and yacht. figure 1 shows how the island escape probability depends on the total number of travellers arriving on a PICT during the course of the global pandemic. 0 = 3.0, these critical values are 155 and 115 travellers respectively. nearly 75% of infected visitors do not show any symptoms upon arrival on a PICT. this value only depends on the natural history of the disease. but it is independent on R0. pandemic severity varies greatly with the experience of the current swine-origin (H1N1) influenza pandemic (at least to mid-2009) indicating a severity that might even be less overall than seasonal influenza. an overall travel reduction by 99% should delay an epidemic on an island by about three weeks if R0 is approximately 2. limitations This analysis made many simplifying assumptions. it could be improved by developing a more complex stochastic model that used log-normal or gamma-distributed sojourn times. only a few PICTs might be expected to avoid pandemic influenza by relying on extremely rigorous travel volume reductions alone. most PICTs need to consider multiple additional options in their pandemic planning. these measures might include: entry screening using health questionnaires and use of rapid diagnostic tests; routine facility quarantine [11] or home quarantine with intensive monitoring. pandemic severity varies greatly with the experience of the current swine-origin (H1N1) influenza pandemic (at least to mid-2009) indicating a severity that might even be less overall than seasonal influenza. some actions that would assist with severe travel volume reductions during pandemic influenza might be worthwhile in their own right. in a global pandemic the effective R0 would decline after the first few months of pandemic emergence. many countries around the world are very likely to adopt social distancing and other control measures. a pandemic strain vaccine might also become available. the technical appendix provides the detailed formulae data for the model used for assessing pandemic influenza importation into islands. two of the authors (NW and MB) have been assisted by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) grant for research work on pandemic influenza control at borders."}
