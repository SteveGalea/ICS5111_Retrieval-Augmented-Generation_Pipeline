{"summary": "the micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel. it has four inlets (one sample inlet, one dye inlet, and two hydraulic focusing sheath inlets) and one outlet for waste. the micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel. the microfluidic flow rates of both the sample and dye suspension were 12.5 L/h. the simulations were carried out using CFD-ACE+. a multi-mode fiber was inserted into the PDMS chip. the mixing zone was 136.8 mm long and 50 m wide. the residence time for mixing was in the range 25\u2013246 s. the concentrated core flow was 7.5 m wide, which is one-twentieth the width of the channel. multi-mode optical fiber with a core diameter of 3.5 m and a cladding diameter of 125 m (Thorlabs) was coupled with a single-mode optical fiber (core diameter: 3.5 m, cladding diameter: 125 m) the laser beam was focused on the core fluid using an objective lens (RMS20x-PF; 20x/0.5; Thorlabs) located beneath the microfluidic channel. the FLPSL particle suspension (1.45 103/L) was injected into sample inlet. as the flow velocity increased from 1.42 to 14.3 mm/s, the frequency of the particle SC and FL signals increased in proportion to the particle flow velocity. the average intensity of the measured SC and FL signals decreased from 140 arbitrary unit (a.u.)/60 a.u. to 46 a.u./30 a.u. the particle SC signal was significantly stronger than the FL signal. we evaluated the particle detection performance of the micro-optofluidic platform with various mixing ratios of FLPSL and PSL particles. the total microfluidic flow rate in the particle detection region was 7.1 mm/s. the FLPSL particle number increased linearly with the FLPSL concentration. the micro-optofluidic platform demonstrated real-time and continuous particle detection. the aerodynamic diameter is equivalent to the diameter of standard-density spherical particles with the same gravitational settling velocity as the original particles48. the number concentration of the particles in air was recorded for each APS channel size, divided by the logarithmic interval of the corresponding particle size range. sampler was 94.3% for the 1-m-diameter PSL particles. diameters in the range 0.6 \u2013 0.8 m and lengths in the range 0.8 \u2013 1.5 m. samples containing the bacterial suspension were injected into the micro-optofluidic platform using a syringe pump. the sample included non-microorganism particles or impurities, such as non-dyed particles or small debris. the microfluidic flow rate was 12.5 L/h at both the sample and dye inlets. concentration of bacteria obtained from the FL signal of the micro-optofluidic platform was compared with the conventional fluorescence microscopy cell counting and colony counting methods. for E. coli the normalized cell concentration by microscopic cell counting was 88 4.6%, and was 67 8.5% using colony counting. micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel. it has four inlets (one sample inlet, one dye inlet, and two hydraulic focusing sheath inlets), and one outlet for waste. the micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel. microfluidic flow rates of the sample and dye suspension were 12.5 L/h. the simulations were carried out using the optical setup. a multi-mode fiber was inserted into the PDMS chip. the equations were solved with Fick\u2019s law of diffusion to describe the dynamics and homogenization of the mixing process in the channel. the numerical simulations show that the mixing of the two fluids was complete approximately 0.1\u20130.4 mm from the entrance of mixing zone. the mixing zone was 136.8 mm long and 50 m wide. a diode-pumped solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and an output power of 2.0 mW (CNI laser, Changchun, China) was coupled with a single-mode optical fiber (core diameter: 3.5 m, cladding diameter: 125 m) a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) module was used to detect the SC and FL signals from the target particles. the particle detection performance of the optofluidic platform was evaluated using standard PSL particles. we used standard spherical polystyrene latex (PSL) and fluorescence PSL particles that were 1 m in diameter. in et al., only 5% of the particle SC signals were unaccompanied by coincident FL signals due to relatively low signal intensity36. the variation in the intensity results from variations in the particle size and particle position in the detection zone. the flow rate of both the PSL and FLPSL particles was 12.5 L/h at the sample and dye inlets. the FLPSL particle number increased linearly with the FLPSL concentration. the micro-optofluidic platform demonstrated real-time and continuous particle detection. the GMDs of E. coli and B. subtilis were similar at 1 m, and that of S. epidermidis was somewhat smaller at 0.8 m. the aerodynamic diameter is equivalent to the diameter of standard-density spherical particles with the same gravitational settling velocity as the original particles48. data are listed as the means of 10 repetitions plus/minus the standard deviation. airborne bacterial bioaerosols in the test chamber were collected using a bioSampler (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) the airborne particle collection efficiency of the BioSampler was 94.3% for the 1-m-diameter PSL particles. the difference between the total particle count (SC signals) and the total bacterial concentration (FL signals) was 7% for E. coli, 16% for B. subtilis, and 23% for S. epidermidis. it follows that the sample included other particles; non-microorganism particles or impurities, such as non-dyed particles or small debris. concentration of bacteria measured using fluorescence microscopy and colony counting was lower than that measured using the micro-optofluidic platform. the micro-optofluidic platform exhibited the highest cell counts and the lowest standard deviation, which is indicative of superior performance. quantitative analysis of the total concentration of particles with sizes of less than 1 m is limited by the resolution and the field of view of bright-field microscopy. the colony counting method measures only culturable cells in the medium. therefore, it is difficult to apply the colony counting method for the analysis of viable but non-culturable microorganisms. a micro-pump between the BioSampler and microfluidic channel could be included for continuous real-time analysis of airborne microorganisms. a micro-pump between the bioSampler and microfluidic channel could be used to create an analysis system that provides data on the physical, chemical and biological properties of the airborne particles. microchannel was a single-layer PDMS channel fabricated using soft lithography.
