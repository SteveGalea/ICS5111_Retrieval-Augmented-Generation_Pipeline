{"summary": "Coronaviruses and toroviruses contain positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes that are the longest known RNA genomes, ranging from 28 to 31 kb (1). first two-thirds of the genome encodes replicase proteins, which include the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and numerous nonstructural proteins (NSPs) NS2 is a critical determinant of MHV strain A59 liver tropism in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. MHVMut replication is reduced at least 10,000-fold compared to that of wild-type (WT) A59. onavirus CoV-4408 (HECoV), the equine coronavirus ECoV-NC99 (ECoV) and the more distantly related equine torovirus (EToV) Berne (BEV) encode NS2 homologs with predicted PDE activity. these proteins (with exception of PHEV NS2) do possess enzymatic 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity that is capable of antagonizing RNase L. the MHV NS2 and RVA VP3-CTD proteins are also structural homologous of AKAP7 CD. they exhibit 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity and can antagonize RNase L (4, 7, 8). the proteins are also structural homologous of AKAP7 CD. onavirus and torovirus 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs are enzymatically active and cleave 2-5A. the genes encoding them as well as their mutants with an Arg substitution of the second predicted catalytic His residue were expressed in Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography. chimeric viruses expressed each exogenous PDE from a MHV NS2 mutant backbone. each exogenous protein was constructed with a C-terminal Flag tag to allow verification of expression from the chimeric viruses. the chimeric viruses are expressed as means and standard errors of the means. in chimeric viruses, MHV NS2 residue 126 is mutated from H to R. the gene encoding the exogenous PDE or its catalytically inactive mutant was inserted in place of MHV NS4. to assess the expression of PDEs by Western blotting, we infected L2 cells with the chimeric viruses. chimeras expressing catalytically inactive exogenous PDEs failed to replicate robustly in B6 BMMs but did replicate efficiently in RNase L/ BMMs. the chimeric virus encoding PHEV NS2 was not assessed for replication in BMMs due to our inability to confirm PHEV NS2 expression. rRNA integrity was assayed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. total RNA was isolated from WT B6 BMMs at 9 hpi. rRNA integrity was assayed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. OC43, HECoV, ECoV, and BEV prevented rRNA degradation in WT B6 BMMs. exogenous viral PDEs restore MHVMut replication and pathogenesis in vivo. MHV causes profound hepatitis and associated liver pathology in mice. WT B6 or RNase L/ mice (n = 5 to 7) were infected intrahepatically with MHV and MHVMut (A) or with chimeric viruses encoding WT or mutant OC43 NS2 (B) or BEV pp1a-CTD (C) at 5 days postinfection, livers were harvested and viruses titrated by plaque assay. each data point represents a single mouse liver titrated in duplicate, with MHV-related betacoronaviruses encode proteins with 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activity. all of these proteins contain two conserved HxS/Tx motifs. the carboxy termini of the PHEV and BEV PDEs are truncated. MHV NS2 (PDB entry 4Z5V) and predicted structures of OC43 NS2 (B) and BEV pp1a-CTD (C) are shown. predicted structures were generated using Phyre2 and then visualized using UCSF Chimera 1.8. MHV NS2 was used as a positive control for inhibition of RNase L. OC43 and BEV proteins reduced RNase L activation to a degree similar to that with MHV NS2. MHV NS2 residue 126 is mutated from H to R, rendering NS2 catalytically inactive (NS2Mut) the gene encoding the exogenous PDE or its catalytically inactive mutant was inserted in place of MHV NS4. the exogenous PDEs were detected at high levels of abundance by Western blotting. the OC43, HECoV, and ECoV PDEs were detectable at high levels of abundance by Western blotting. PHEV NS2 expression from multiple viral clones and the swarm of uncloned recombinant viruses could not be detected. chimeras expressing catalytically inactive exogenous PDEs failed to replicate robustly in B6 BMMs but did replicate efficiently in RNase L/ BMMs. chimeric virus encoding PHEV NS2 was not assessed for replication in BMMs due to our inability to confirm PHEV NS2 expression. total RNA was isolated from WT B6 BMMs at 9 hpi. rRNA integrity was assayed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. this directly links the ability of the exogenous PDEs to rescue MHVMut replication to their antagonism. chimeric viruses expressing mutant OC43 NS2 or pp1a-CTD replicated robustly in the liver. at 5 days postinfection, livers were harvested and viruses titrated by plaque assay. each data point represents a single mouse liver titrated in duplicate. chimeric viruses expressing OC43 NS2 or BEV pp1a-CTD caused hepatitis in infected mice. liver sections were assessed for viral antigen and pathological changes. chimeric viruses expressing OC43 NS2 or BEV pp1a-CTD did not cause liver pathology in B6 mice. the presence of genes encoding these proteins in multiple lineage A betacoronaviruses suggests that the gene was acquired by an ancient common ancestor of this lineage. the maintenance of this highly conserved protein throughout lineage A betacoronaviruses supports the idea that this protein mediates an essential function in the diverse natural hosts of these viruses. this protein mediates an essential function in the diverse natural hosts of these viruses, spanning multiple mammalian families. PHEV NS2 is less enzymatically active than the other PDEs. the rotavirus VP3-CTD and BEV PDEs have activities similar to that of MHV NS2. this suggests that the PDE may have been essential in the PHEV ancestor but may not be required in the cells targeted by PHEV. chimeric MHVs encoding OC43 NS2 and BEV pp1a-CTD did not replicate quite as well as MHV in vivo. this is unlikely to be due to disruption of the ORF4 gene by insertion of the exogenous PDE genes. however, these chimeric viruses replicated robustly in vivo, causing hepatitis. NS2 genes from the lineage A betacoronaviruses OC43, HECoV, ECoV, and PHEV were synthesized and cloned into pUC57 by BioBasic. pUC-OC43NS2, pUC-HECoV, pUC-ECoV, and pUC-PHEV were synthesized and cloned into pUC57 by bioBasic. pMAL-OC43NS2H129R, pUC-HECVNS2H129R, pUC-NC99NS2H129R, pUC-PHEVNS2H129R, and pMAL-pp1aH4516R. MHV NS2 and NS2H129R had previously been cloned into pMAL-c2 (4). OC43 [75 g/ml], BEV [60 g/ml], PHEV [65 g/ml], or MHV [70 g/ml] MBP-PDE fusion protein was incubated in 150 l of assay buffer (20 M HEPES [pH 7.2], 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) after 1 h, reactions were stopped by heat inactivation at 95\u00b0 recombinant viruses were coding an NS2H126R mutation, as previously described (8). the full-length A59 genomic cDNA was assembled, and the recombinant viruses were recovered in BHK-R cells. when virus cytopathology was observed, virus was plaque purified from the supernatant and amplified on 17CL1 cells. L2 cells were infected with MHV or chimeric viruses. at 10 hpi, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. supernatants were mixed 3:1 with 4 SDS-PAGE sample buffer. samples were boiled, separated by 4 to 15% SDS-PAGE. four-week-old B6 or RNase L/ mice (4, 6\u20138) were anesthetized with isoflurane. inoculated intrahepatically with 2,000 PFU of virus in 50 l of Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco) containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) C57BL/6 (B6) mice were originally procured from the National Cancer Institute's mouse repository. primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were derived from marrow harvested from the hind limbs of 4- to 6-week-old B6 or RNase L/ mice as described previously (4, 22) select genes were subcloned into pMal parallel-2 expression vector. MHV NS2 and NS2H129R had previously been cloned into pMAL-c2 (4). integrity and purity of the purified MBP fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue R250 staining. reitol was incubated at 30\u00b0C with (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3 (2-5A) after 1 h, reactions were stopped by heat inactivation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 min of centrifugation at 20,000 g (4\u00b0C) chimeric viruses were constructed based on the infectious cDNA clone icMHV-A59 (19, 24) meric viruses expressing WT and mutant PDEs were named by the source of the PDE gene. the sequences were verified by PCR from the cloned chimeric virus genomes. the primers used for sequencing were Fns4 (5\u2032-TTGTTGATGAGTATGGAG), which maps 136 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon of the PDE gene. supernatants were mixed 3:1 with 4 SDS-PAGE sample buffer. samples were boiled, separated by 4 to 15% SDS-PAGE. blots were probed sequentially with antibodies. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) and inoculated intrahepatically with 2,000 PFU of virus in 50 l of Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) (Gibco) containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) part of the liver was fixed for histology and the rest was homogenized."}
