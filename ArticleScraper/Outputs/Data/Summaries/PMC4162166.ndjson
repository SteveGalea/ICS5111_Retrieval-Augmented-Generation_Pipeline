Fig. 4, A\u2013F, show comparisons between monomeric HYBC and dimeric fold of the HYB domain. differences in the folding arose from changes in the C2H2 ZnF in HYBC. this is in contrast to the sharing of zinc ions between the two monomers in the atypical zinc-binding motif of the HYB domain. the relative rotations that result in the conformational change are indicated by arrows orientated in a clockwise direction. the yellow dot represents the original position of the C-terminal zinc ion at Site 3 of the monomeric Hakai counterpart in the dimeric HYB domain. the green dot represents the new position of the Site 3 zinc ion in HYBC. topology of HYBC (E) is compared with that of the HYB domain (PDB code 3vk6) (F) the zinc ions are shown as spheres (color coded according to the monomer colors) in HYBC, Site 3 and Site 3\u2032 share residues from both monomers.

HYBC elutes as a dimer in the presence of the ligand and as a monomer in its apo form. HYBC undertook chemical shift perturbation analyses of HYBC in the presence of phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759). results showed a significant shift for 2 helix in the presence of phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) peptide. NH HSQC assignments for HYBC complex were confirmed by 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiment. the empty regions represent no information available for residues in those regions because the NH HSQC peaks of those residues were invisible or unassigned. asp750, Val752, Tyr(P)756, and Glu757 are the interacting sites from the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) peptide (14). the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) peptide ligand is shown in orange. gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism of the HYBC (aa 106\u2013194) showed a peak corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of monomeric HYBC (10,200 Da) the dynamic light scattering experiments also revealed an apparent molecular weight of monomeric HYBC. NMR structure of HYBC was refined to a final r.m.s. deviation of 0.63 0.21 (backbone) the solution structure of HYBC revealed a monomeric fold. the solution structure of HYBC contained three zinc-coordination sites. the two cysteines (Cys166 and Cys172) formed a hairpin loop and the two histidines (His185 and His190) were found juxtaposed to the -helix (2).

Fig. 4 shows comparisons between the monomeric HYBC and the dimeric fold of the HYB domain. a stretch of residues from 106 to 166 contains the RING domain and part of the C-terminal domain. the folds of HYBC and Hakai (aa 106\u2013206) of the HYB domain are completely different, with the helix 2 flipping by 180\u00b0 and separating by 25. the relative rotations that result in the conformational change are indicated by arrows orientated in a clockwise direction. the HYB domain (PDB code 3vk6) contains a dimeric fold of paired Hakai monomers. in monomeric HYBC, all four zinc-binding residues are situated in the same monomeric chain. the structure rearrangement arises because of a systematic reshuffling among the zinc-binding residues. the ITC experiment revealed that HYBC binds with the Tyr(P) ligand of E-cadherin with a binding stoichiometry of 2:1 (HYBC:Tyr(P) ligand) and an affinity value of Kd = 3.7 m. the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) ligand interacts with a dimeric form of HYBC. the results show the T1 and T2 values change in the presence and absence of the substrate peptide. the secondary structures and domain boundary of HYBC are illustrated in the middle of the figure. the missing residues and weak intensity residues are located in the region between 3 and 2. the results suggest that HYBC switches from a monomeric conformation to a dimeric form in the presence of a Tyr(P)-containing ligand. the results showed a significant shift for 2 helix in the presence of phospho-E-cadherin. the electrostatic surface potential representation of HYBC in the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) peptide complex model suggests that the Tyr(P) along with the surrounding acidic residues on the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) peptide potentially interact with the positively charged HYBC binding pocket. NH HSQC assignments for HYBC complex were confirmed by 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiment. HYBCTyr(P) peptide complex model was generated based on chemical shift data. previous mutational and binding studies showed the interaction of his127, Tyr176, His185, and Arg189 of HYB with the E-cadherin. gel-filtration elution profile showed that HYBC had an apparent molecular weight equivalent to a monomeric subunit. elution profile suggests that HYBC exists as a monomer in solution. a conformational change in HYBC in the presence of the phosphorylated ligand. the phosphorylated peptide of E-cadherin (corresponding to residues 747\u2013759) showed significant differences in the secondary structure composition between the monomeric HYBC and the dimeric HYB domain. the RING domain contained the third zinc-coordination site of HYBC, formed by the residues Cys166, Cys172, His185, and His190. the two cysteines (Cys166 and Cys172) formed a hairpin loop and the two histidines (His185 and His190) were juxtaposed to the -helix (2). 96.9% Residues in generally allowed regions 2.3% Residues in disallowed regions 0.8% Average R.m.s. deviations from mean structure ()e Heavy atoms 1.29 0.21 Backbone atoms 0.63 0.21 a The distance restraints were obtained by classifying the NOE cross peaks into three categories: strong (1.8\u20132.9 ), medium (1.8\u20133.5 ), and weak (1.8\u20135.0. the overall structure of HYBC was compared with other proteins present in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (34) the results showed several structural homologs containing a similar RING domain, but none bore any resemblance beyond amino acid residue 166 of the C-terminal domain of HYBC. the fold of the linker sequence (residues 149\u2013166) overlap in both HYBC and the monomer of the HYB domain. structural differences arose from residue 167 onward, which corresponds to the C-terminal zinc-coordination site and the terminal -helix (2). Fig. 4 shows comparisons between monomeric HYBC and the dimeric fold of the HYB domain. the yellow dot represents the original position of the C-terminal zinc ion at Site 3 of the monomeric Hakai counterpart in the dimeric HYB domain. the yellow dot represents the original position of the C-terminal zinc ion at Site 3 of the monomeric Hakai counterpart in the dimeric HYB domain. the monomeric fold of HYBC (green) contains a C2H2 ZnF in the C-terminal domain. the HYB domain (PDB code 3vk6) contains a dimeric fold of paired Hakai monomers. in monomeric HYBC, all four zinc-binding residues are situated in the same monomeric chain. isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments revealed that HYBC binds with the peptide ligand of E-cadherin with a binding stoichiometry of 2:1. this indicates that the phospho-E-cadherin-(747\u2013759) ligand interacts with a dimeric form of HYBC. the ligand-induced dimerization of HYBC was studied using sedimentation velocity analysis. the results show that the protein exists as a dimer in the presence of the ligand with an apparent molecular mass of 20,000 Da. D, 15N relaxation T1 (a) and T2 (b) values as well as the error values for each residues in free HYBC sample (labeled as a red star) the average T1 and T2 values for the free HYBC were 0.88 s and 120 ms respectively. however, upon binding to the peptide, the average T1 and T2 values for the complex were 1.02 s and 100 ms. our observations from the solution experiments, structural analysis, chemical shift perturbation data, and previous mutational data (14) suggest that the Tyr(P) ligand induces the dimerization to create a binding pocket in HYBC for substrate recognition. the NH HSQC assignments for HYBC complex were confirmed by three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments. the ligand-induced dimeric configuration of the HYBC monomers is shown in green and magenta. the zinc ions are shown as red spheres. the peptide ligand is shown in orange. the recently identified Tyr(P)-binding fold in Hakai, HYB, bears a novel dimeric fold consisting of two atypical ZnFs shared between the paired Hakai monomers. tyrosine phosphorylation mediated dimerization has been reported to occur via SH2 domains (44\u201346) the atypical atypical ZnF is replaced by a C2H2-type ZnF in HYBC. it is formed by two cysteines and two histidines, all situated on the same monomer. this represents a unique monomeric to dimeric switching mechanism. the ligand binds with the protein only in its dimeric form. RING finger ubiquitin ligase family members require dimerization for their function. cIAP, XIAP, RNF4, SIAH, and TRAF2 act as homodimers (56\u201360), whereas heterodimers form between MDM2 and MDMX, BRCA1 and BARD1 and RING1b and BMI1 respectively (61)"}
