{"summary": "RNA viruses are of great diversity, and they are the etiological agents of many important human and animal infectious diseases, including influenza, rabies, several types of infectious hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), classical swine fever, rinderpest and avian infectious bronchitis [1]\u2013[10]. this work is quite difficult if the RNA virus has not been discovered in the past. the first three correspond to the former nonofficial \u201cgroups\u201d 1, 2 and 3. all known CoVs detected from domestic fowls are members of the genus Gammacoronavirus [18], [19]. avian coronaviruses include infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and similar viruses isolated from pheasants and peafowl. 33 of the sequences are only 208 bp in length covering a short and conserved region in the viral 1b gene. we also performed a molecular survey of coVs in domestic fowls in china. if the target region in the viral genome is too conserved, the detection may be insensitive in identifying the target virus. the duck CoV was designated as DK/CH/ZJ2012 and abbreviated as DK2012-CoV below. these 22 sequences reads formed six contigs corresponding to the viral 1b gene. the six contigs harbored 15.70% different nucleotide residues compared to the sequences of the unique duck CoV. the phylogenetic relationships of the viral 1b gene were calculated using the maximum likelihood method. the results suggested that the 1b1, 1b2 and 1b3 sequences were distinct with their counterparts of IBVs. the mean identities in the amino acid sequences between DK2012-CoV and the 13 IBVs were 87.30% in 1b1, 86.37% in 1b2 and 86.66% in 1b3. a total of 2614 samples from domestic fowls were collected and detected in the survey. the prevalence of the virus was approximately 4.25% in chickens, 0.80% in ducks and 1.82% in geese. Clade 1 covered common IBVs distributed in many countries including the USA, China, Iran, Israel, India, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, France, Nigeria, etc. from the 1960s to the 2010s. Clade 1 could be further divided into Subclades 1.1\u20131.5. subclades are 0.1773 (SD = 0.0147) the mean of genetic distance within the clades is 0.0929 (SD = 0.0095). the mean of genetic distance within the clades is 0.0732 (SD = 0.0073). we further calculated the phylogenetic distribution of the 530 avian CoVs. two of them were genetically closer to the duck-specific Clade 4. the other two were genetically closer to the duck-specific Clade 4. the other two were genetically closer to the duck-specific Clade 4 along with the virus DK2012-CoV. a total of 13,781,274 sequence reads were obtained through the RNA-Seq detection of the pooled duck feces sample. 22 sequence reads were homologous with IBV genes through the standalone BLAST search in the downloaded nucleotide database. the duck CoV was designated as DK/CH/ZJ2012 and abbreviated as DK2012-CoV below. RT-PCR primers successfully used in amplification of viral 1b gene.

CK, DK, CH were the abbreviations of chicken, duck and china. phylogenetic relationships of the remaining 122 representative sequences were calculated using the simple neighbor-joining method. phylogenetic relationships of the remaining 122 representative sequences were calculated using the maximum likelihood method. Clade 1 covered common IBVs distributed in many countries including the USA, China, Iran, Israel, India, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, France, Nigeria, etc. from the 1960s to the 2010s. 530 avian CoVs reported by this study were marked with triangles. the corresponding strain designations were CK, DK, TK, GS, PN, CH. Clade 2 and Subclade 1.2 were likely specific to pigeons, ducks and geese. all the CoVs from turkeys and some CoVs from pigeons, ducks and geese were similar to many chicken IBVs within the same Clade 1. phylogeny of some CoVs based on their 1b3 sequences was prevalent in wild water fowls in the Bering Strait Area [31]. if the viral reads are highly divergent from any known viruses, no hits may be found for these viral reads. the genomes of avian CoVs are approximately 27\u201331 kb in length, the largest for known animal RNA viruses. rapid mutations plus large RNA genomes of CoVs create difficulties in developing effective vaccines and conducting viral genome sequencing. the host-specific clades or subclades may result from different virus strains. replication isolation can act on viral N gene through genetic hitchhiking. the region-specific clades may result from geographical isolation. feces samples from clinical dead ducks were collected from the intestines of the ducks that died from diseases. swab samples from poultry farms, backyard flocks, slaughtering houses and live bird markets were all collected with permission from multiple parties. filtered solution was mixed at 4\u00b0C for 2 h with a 1/10 volume of 50% (w/v) PEG 6000 which was dissolved in 1.5 M NaCl. solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. solution was further incubated with the cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes. analysis of RNA-Seq Data Sequences in the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database (NT) similar to the sequence reads of the RNA-Seq were searched using the standalone BLASTn [46]. results were parsed with the software MetaGenome Analyzer (MEGAN) [47] and were used for design of RT-PCR primers. RT-PCR was performed in a 50-L reaction system with incubation at 42\u00b0C for 30 min and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min. primers flank a 573-nucleotide region in the viral N gene. the primers flank a 573-nucleotide region in the viral N gene. the primers are conserved in all known avian CoVs within the genus Gammacoronavirus. phylogenetic relationships of viral 1b gene sequences in this study were performed in the same way except that only several reference sequences selected randomly from GenBank were involved in the analysis. genetic distances were calculated using the same parameters used for the phylogenetic analysis. the feces samples from clinical dead ducks were collected from the intestines of the ducks that died from diseases. the samples were pooled together and diluted using a nine-fold volume of phosphate buffered saline. the solution was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the solution was then incubated with the cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes consisting of 14 U of Turbo DNase ( RNA-Seq Library Construction and Sequencing The viral RNA was applied for cDNA library preparation according to the protocol reported previously. the first-stranded cDNA was purified using the Ampure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) the first-stranded cDNA was purified using the second adaptor. 2614 swab samples were collected randomly from domestic fowls in 17 provinces in china. the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min. the supernatants were inoculated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free eggs. min and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. RT-PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA extraction kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China), and directly sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer model 377 XL DNA sequencer. the best substitution model of the aligned sequences was determined as the one with the lowest Baye KC869933\u2013KC869936 for the sequences of the RNA-Seq contigs (>200 bp) sequences of avian CoVs reported previously or by this study were designated or re-designated."}
