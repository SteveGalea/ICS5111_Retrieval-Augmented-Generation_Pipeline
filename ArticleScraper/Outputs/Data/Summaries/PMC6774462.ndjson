{"summary": "people working in laboratory animal research are exposed to a variety of situations and experiences that, over time, can cause chronic stress and emotional exhaustion. these situations and experiences include frequent euthanasia of animals, creation and maintenance of animal disease models, unexpected adverse events involving animals. these experiences can negatively affect a person and lead to compassion fatigue. a study was conducted to assess complication rates in immunocompromised mice implanted with microchips using either physical or chemical restraint. one group each of NSG and NSG-SGM3 mice were microchipped using a physical restraint device. the restraint device method was then validated for groups (n=20) of nude (J:NU) and humanized (NSG and NSG-SGM3) mice. postimplantation did not vary significantly between groups (P > 0.06). the only notable complication was occasional microchip loss immediately following implantation using the physical restraint device. we concluded that all of the assessed microchipping methods were acceptable for use on immunocompromised mice. all data was normalized to each individual macaque\u2019s baseline data. dominance status remained unchanged throughout SIV infection for all pairs. dominance hierarchy is unlikely to affect data produced by the model. 100% of designated nonrecovery animals were successfully dosed with a 1:1 ratio of contrast and saline as seen on the fluoroscopic images. over 2,700 animals have been successfully dosed with minimal complications lasting less than 24 h. some PET and fluorescence tracers can be delivered in conscious animals. nontrappable PET tracers and probes for DCE-MRI and DCE-CT have to be delivered on scanner in anesthetized animal. techniques include a butterfly catheter with saline approach for standard PET tracers and imaging probes. modifying each of these items to be as minimally invasive as possible increased the primate\u2019s successful trials and decreased the amount of time spent on distraction-related behaviors. we hypothesized that these changes would result in a more relaxed primate, allowing the animal to learn tasks more efficiently. we designed a scalp retractor that is easily positioned and atraumatically retracts the scalp with substantial exposure of the skull. the shape, size, and tension imparted by the retractor is well matched to the size of the mouse. the limiting factors associated with performing the microdialysis and CMP surgery in the same surgical session are the time required to customize the chamber, the extended surgery time and the inability to ensure functionality. the next step was to evaluate if we need a customized head cap when targeting the cortex, a larger brain region. deficiency findings at the IACUC\u2019s semiannual inspections contributed to this complexity. the electronic training record website satisfied IACUC, AAALAC, OLAW, and environment, health and safety requirement of employee training records in a central location. ulock buttons were accessed twice weekly for 90 d postsurgery. the catheter was flushed with heparin:glycerol and a flush solution of heparinized saline. at the end of 90 d all animals were euthanized and a necropsy was completed. body weights were taken from weaning to 90 d of age, and again from 133 to 180 d of age. results indicated significantly improved outcomes for anxiety-based testing, consistently higher body weights, statistically fewer bite wounds, and a statistically significant decrease in identified aggressive behaviors from mice in partially divided cages. the dose site is shaved and scrubbed with chlorhexidine solution. the hind limb is bent to allow the indent on the knee at the end of the patella to be located. the needle is then gently inserted through the space below the patella and the needle will drop into the joint with no resistance. singly housed macaques experience a more profound decline in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells, greater T cell activation, and higher plasma and central nervous system viral loads. we hypothesized that social housing of SIV-infected macaques would cause changes in CNS dopamine and serotonin metabolism compared to single housing. rabbit models are used in the biomedical industry for good laboratory practice (GLP) safety and toxicity testing, antibody production, and preclinical studies. the goal was to introduce individually housed rabbits to a positive experience from the moment they arrived into the animal care program. the novel enrichment program has contributed to the 3Rs by refining environmental enrichment opportunities leading to a reduction in rabbit numbers and reuse of rabbits for training or retirement purposes. many training programs are institution-based, which limits the transferability of tools and programs between institutions and the field overall. skills based training must include a reference to the reason the institution is asking the employee to learn each skill, whether that be the company vision or the program\u2019s mission statement. we hypothesize that skills based training will generate a more flexible workforce long term. serial CSF samples can be obtained from the same mouse at 2-mo intervals. average collection volume is 6 l (2 to 10 l) a successful surgical outcome requires appropriate attention to aseptic and surgical techniques. at present, this registry has saved at least 3 investigators from having to import animals from outside sources. this registry has saved at least 3 investigators from having to import animals from outside sources. the use of antibiotics to decrease the microbial flora does not require special equipment. neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin in the drinking water for 4 wk. mice were placed on 1 of the following drinking water regimes: ampicillin/neomycin/metronidazole/vancomycin water (n=13), enrofloxacin/ampicillin water (n=11) mice were weighed and water consumption measured. s (6 males and 6 females per group) that were euthanized by carbon dioxide (30%, 50%, and 70% volume per minute displacement rate of 100% CO2), isoflurane (3% or 5% inhaled in 0.5L/min O2), or pentobarbital (354mg, IP) behaviors (rearing, freezing/walking backward, jumping, defecation) were recorded for each treatment. the longitudinal vaginal septa (LVS) are bands of tissue of varying thickness that bisect the vaginal canal longitudinally, creating a \u201cY\u201d in the vaginal canal. this is done to avoid lost research time, unnecessary per diem charges, and to prevent health complications and pain to the female mouse due to the risk of dystocia. the training program has evolved from a strictly instructor-led, classroom-based, classroom-based program to a blended learning method. comprehensive online training modules are used for the initial introduction of information while instructor-led follow-up sessions provide a review that emphasizes key concepts. the online modules must be effective at presenting the information in a manner conducive to comprehension. training focused on aseptic technique, analgesia, and supportive care. trainers were asked to develop lab-specific checklists, training references, and standard operating procedures. the program critically depends on enthusiastic lab participation to be effective. the clinical veterinarian presented the CE in two components: (1) a presentation which outlined proper dental charting, tools, techniques, and benefits associated with performing a COHAT. participants were awarded 3 h of continuing education credits. this CE provided a unique opportunity for staff to be directly involved in providing the gold standard of care for dogs maintained within our institution. mice with standard enrichment received a red polycarbonate shelter and 2 cotton squares. mice in complex enrichment had a red polycarbonate mezzanine with 2 side ladders. females in standard enrichment showed higher activity and longer duration of the response to visual inspection (P 0.01) while males in complex enrichment showed fewer bout events and fight wounds (P 0.05) tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) and eugenol submersion, and rapid chilling as euthanasia methods for tadpoles at 8, 23, and 45 d postfertilization. tadpoles were randomly selected for study groups (n=35) and placed in MS-222 (6g/L), eugenol (600uL/L), a ratio of ice:water, or a tank water euthanizing larval X. laevis tadpoles of various life stages of development was not acceptable. we recommend MS-222 at 6g/L as an effective method for euthanizing larval X. laevis. forceful perfusion can be used across several species to collect the entire spinal cord and spinal fluid simultaneously. forceful perfusion uses readily available laboratory supplies that provides pressure using air, saline, or PBS through the spinal canal. no differences in self-directed stereotypies, pacing, or affiliative behavior were detected. adult males housed with juveniles exhibited similar levels of pacing (T =.97, P=.36) and affiliative behavior (T =.37, P =.72) our team adapted the conical tube in a way that allowed the adult Gg domesticus\u2019 head, cone, and wattle to be completely sealed within a funnel connected to the isoflurane tube. the Leghorns were more susceptible to anesthesia due to the reduction in evaporation of liquid anesthesia typically caused by a poor seal. 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine and 1.5 mg/kg carprofen were administered separately via subcutaneous injections. the ET tube rested to the left of the upper incisors and was allowed to exit over the central bar of the U-frame on the left. h long infusion restraint included the use of a procedure cage where all limbs were secured with limit movement. the technique would be highly stressful for animals under 1 yof age. the hammocks are hung using 16-gauge galvanized steel formed into a hook. both rats were using the hammock to sleep, play, and groom. the hammocks have proven to be durable, easy to place and remove. our IACUC has established a Quality Assurance (QA) team. the QA specialists work to facilitate compliance and minimize barriers to the conduct of sound, robust research. results from the QA visits are bolstered by data collection projects. a total of 48 rats, 8-12 wk old, were randomly divided into 6 groups. rats received meloxicam, dipyrone, tramadol, and meloxicam-tramadol by intraperitoneal injection. DT and DT groups showed shorter distance traveled and lower average speed. rectal prolapse is defined as the exposure of the distal tissue of the rectum, appearing as a red mass of variable size protruding from the anus. it is an animal welfare problem because it can cause pain, irritation, and infection, besides potentially affecting digestive functionality of animals. acclimate mice to oral gavage by sham dosing the animals for 1 wk prior to beginning the study. the minimum frequency of dosing and duration of acclimation is unknown. the study was conducted over a 3-wk period. group 4 food consumption remained significantly lower than the control group until after d 13. body weight and food consumption data from group 4 show that sham dosing on a Monday\u2013Friday schedule over 2 wk is sufficient to acclimate mice to oral gavage procedure. aseptic techniques, and sanitation methods were implemented to document the work performed. successful reduction of the quarantine period to 2 wk (50% reduction) for mice arriving into Beijing promotes science, improves quality, shares knowledge, improves efficiencies, reduces costs. each experimental group contained 7 replicate cages. filter paper type 2 located on the cage bottom, and 3) 2, 10-wk-old, female, ICR sentinel mice. each group contained 7 replicate cages. two handlers work daily with the pigeon, in increasing time increments. the bird responds best to a slow approach of hands when they are below the bottom half of his body. a step-wise increase in nonhandling human interaction can be used successfully for behavioral modification of an undomesticated avian species. sulfoxaflor residues in rats and pigs were significantly correlated with those in rats. sulfoxaflor residues in rats and pigs were significantly correlated with those in rats. RIS manages over 400 IACUC protocols across 3 campuses. species range from fish and rodents to sheep and non-human primates. over time the vastness of the program led to inconsistency in how protocols are reviewed by the RIS. naming helps to decrease mouse usage while maintaining a high level training program. no work has been done to specifically examine the role that naming plays in animal care or the effect it has on the care staff. researchers have shown that pair-housed monkeys do not interfere with cranial implants for compatible macaques. pair-housed monkeys are typically separated from their partner, which may be stressful for both individuals. the retirement of nonhuman primates comes with a unique set of hurdles. the retirement of nonhuman primates comes with a unique set of hurdles that may need approval at many levels of the institution. erley* frontage Laboratories, Inc., Concord, OH pigs are becoming an increasingly popular species in pharmacology and toxicology. the use of modified rodent vascular buttons for blood sample collection in miniature pigs is becoming more common in Europe because of ease of access, reduced stress for animals and staff, and cost. technicians in enrichment activities met as rumor of these activities spread. the immediate outcome was the involvement of nonvivarium staff members to become involved in our enrichment program. this triggered a dialogue with nonvivarium workers about what our animal research entailed and the level of care we provide to our animals. a single intravenous plasma transfusion was capable of raising serum IgG levels in the premature lamb. a single intravenous plasma transfusion was capable of raising serum IgG levels in the premature lamb, but these levels were not elevated to the threshold of being considered protective. the QA hideaway program consists of placing plastic mice in empty mouse boxes or QA cards throughout the facilities for technicians to find and report to the veterinary staff. the sooner a QA mouse or card was found after being placed, the greater the prize. the sooner a QA mouse or card was found, the greater the prize. we descibes a user-friendly, portable fold-up device for humanely and easily restraining small- to medium-sized animals. the animals are comfortably restrained in sternal recumbancy, supported by an acrylic, fully washable fleece-lined hammock attached to a light weight folding frame. twenty-six males arrived and were housed in 2 groups in indoor pen housing. the monkeys were brought to our facility as models for pharmaceutical therapeutics for obesity. this process has opened honest communication among all parties. novel cage design was tested in a 5-mouse setting to operate on a 21-d cage change schedule using airflow rates of 30 ACH. a traditional IVC design was compared to the novel IVC design in breeding C57Bl/6J mice. anesthetized rabbits tend to exhibit large amounts of stress in most handling circumstances due to their nature as a prey animal. despite this fact, no definitive study has determined whether anesthetic premedication reduces stress versus mask induction alone. a neurosurgical laboratory was developed to train second-year neurosurgery residents on microsurgical techniques. each second-year resident attends one half-day session twice a month. modules 3 and 5 introduce the live rat under general anesthesia for femoral artery, vein and end to side dissection. phantom training tools have been created by the royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada for the training of surgeons in all specialties including neurosurgery. the 3Rs represent a practical method for responsible and humane care and use of animals in accordance with the principles of the guide. to create the phantom mouse, we wrapped a piece of felt secured with double sided tape to the hard-plastic mouse body. additional options include opting out of wrapping the tumors in the batting for beginner training and then advancing the training with smaller tumors. the Council for Science and Animal Welfare (C-SAW) is our expert group leading a global approach to the use of animals in research. AST support all internal animal research, local compliance, champion the 3Rs and animal welfare. sharing our animal work with nonanimal users has been well received. Adaptil, a widely available form of DAP comes in sprays and diffusers. blood collection took place whereas sling acclimation took place on Fridays for 6 consecutive wk. a technique using an automated periotome was identified. it provides a rapid in and out mechanical action using a thin blade to atraumatically sever the periodontal ligament. this approach drastically reduces procedure times and reduces ergonomic concerns. the region is 10 years late in development compared to America or Europe. it was proposed to change from a caging system to a penning system for a new colony of new Zealand white rabbits. staff assessed previously reported animal welfare improvements. serial microsampling reduces the number of rodents required, costs, and resources over terminal composite sampling. venipuncture sites may yield differences in clinical pathology values. the site of venipuncture should differ from site of intravenous drug administration. cling film (CF) is a practical, cost-effective alternative to sterile drapes for rodent surgeries. aluminum foil (AF) has also been proposed to assist in maintaining a sterile environment by covering surgical light handles, stereotaxic apparatuses. ATP bioluminescence remained at 0 RLU for 28 d after opening the box. the results support the use of CF and AF as acceptable alternatives for use during rodent aseptic surgery. vet techs are trained by the training team, which consists of the vet tech supervisors and the training manager. training sessions are scheduled on an as needed basis as new staff are hired. vet techs are required to practice on their own to become comfortable with performing the procedure on an active study. the procedure was purely visually monitored for signs of stress and pain in mice. a second issue was that we could not guarantee the required increase of CO2 due to the design of the chamber. we developed a fully automated fail-safe solution that guarantees a constant and measurable increase of CO2. research integrity specialist combines training from both the IACUC and IBC offices to ensure that reviews of both protocols were consistent with one another. this process alleviates the need for the administrator to blindly hand off the IACUC review to another reviewer who may not know the requirements for the IACUC review. the heifers were socialized by personnel up to 5 d per week for a minimum of 30 min per session. a qualitive and quantitative survey has been developed and will be used for the third and fourth cohorts. as of March 2019, 21 of 24 heifers in 3 cohorts have responded positively to staff. venipuncture was applied to pouched rats with and without spontaneously developed diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia. tests were performed without requiring venipuncture and confirmed clinical diagnoses of diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia. in 1984, the first central animal research facility of the UNAM was created and it houses the DM. for the last 35 years it has kept its name as unidad Acad\u00e9mica Bioterio (UAB) and continues to provide support to the scientific community of the DM. harm-benefit analysis is a well-established method in animal research where the word \u201crisk\u201d provides for a prospective mitigation of potential adverse effects. harm-benefit analysis was recently introduced in the european Union using the word \u201charm\u201d as a replacement word for \u201crisk\u201d in the benefits analysis process. CIRS-LAS.de is the world\u2019s first published web based critical incident database for laboratory animal science. more than 90 people from Europe are already registered users of the CIRS-LAS portal and more than 55 critical incidents have already been entered. the training team determined that part 2 had several design flaws in its original form. it included too much jargon, too many different class topics, few active learning opportunities, and ample opportunities for various instructors to teach the material differently. the training team analyzed the workshop content and used historical student evaluation data. Xenopus laevis were housed at 5 frogs per enclosure and provided with 25.2 liters of water per frog. in the wild, Xenopus are found in shallow, stagnant bodies of water where they remain still at the water surface or floor. this has led some institutions to allocate floor space as opposed to water volume. pathologists and comparative medicine veterinarians and scientists together into a single functional unit. early on we held a discovery engagement workshop attended by all pathologists and comparative medicine veterinarians and scientists. the aim of this workshop was to share learnings from the above activities and devise plans aimed at achieving our overall goal of functional integration. IQ Consortium member companies convened to develop an informed and objective response, focusing on potential gaps or missing information. the authors agree that many positions in the opinion generally align with industry views on the use of NHPs in research and testing. orientation training is becoming an essential learning management software. the benefits of online training include the ability to incorporate knowledge check questions to confirm that key points are retained. the ability of lab members to complete training on their own time and at their own pace. 64% of those who complete our training return to reference the material. carbon is widely used as an electrical conductor and we have developed an electrically powered resistive heater element using carbon fibre sheeting that works effectively on the bench. the heater elements are also cost effective to produce. we have developed an effective reporting structure with the IACUC to discuss and relay findings and ensure closure of documentation. we have developed a collegial rapport with the research staff, as demonstrated by the rate of compliance for amendment submission. temperatures within the clean cages continued to rise over time. within 20 min they were heated to 34\u00b0C (paper chip), 34.5\u00b0C (wood chip) and 32.4\u00b0C (corncob) the terrarium mat will remain in place for as long as vet staff recommend. the intraperitoneal implanted microchip gave reliable data, averaging within 0.9% of the rectal temperature values. the telemetry readings were within 1.7% and the subcutaneous values were within 2.7% of the rectal readings. the intraperitoneal implant readings consistently remained close to the rectal temperature values throughout the trial. the PCS was created to provide researchers with a pair of technical hands. this includes oral gavage, tail vein or retroorbital injections, blood collection, and colony management. this includes oral gavage, tail vein or retroorbital injections, blood collection, and colony management. a conscious jugular \u2018micro-sample\u2019 collection technique (50l) for rats, and a \u2018low volume\u2019 cephalic/saphenous collection technique (600l) for large animals (beagle/cyno) were developed. these techniques enabled the collection of TK samples using minimal sample volumes, and maintained the same (or more) time points. reduced overall collection volumes allowed for additional sample type collection, of particular value in primates and rats. we created an onboarding member survey to provide to new committee members after training to evaluate our new process. it is important for institutions to continually evaluate their training program to ensure the IACUC committee can effectively evaluate protocols and animal welfare issues. trainee satisfaction was higher (P 0.002, D > 1.0) in the new program for the areas of program delivery and engagement. the new training program was well received and appears to be producing successful trainees. the catheter and transcutaneous button were locked using heparinized (500 IU/ml) 50% dextrose solution. the catheter was aspirated to confirm the ability to withdraw blood. if aspiration failed, a saline flush was attempted. a monthly animal experiment technique hands-on workshop and a biweekly new user guidance education for animal research facility. the researcher should participate in the refresher training program as well as an ethical animal experiment seminar bimonthly. we educate approximately 450 new investigators every year. the interinstitutional animal care and use committee was established in 2019. the committee now allows to conduct and monitor all ABSL-2/ABSL-3 studies in accordance with international standards. the first important milestone in the development of sustainable IACUCs system has been successfully achieved. since 2016 the Georgian Association for Laboratory Animal Science (GALAS) aims to contribute to biomedical research by step-by-step implementation of laboratory animal care and use policy in Georgia. the ratification of the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes remain among the main objectives for further success. of 4 or 5 is reported to the veterinary staff for immediate welfare evaluation and a treatment plan that provides compassionate care, alleviates pain and distress, or results in euthanasia. increased awareness of these predictive signs through clinical scoring has improved the prevention of spontaneous deaths among research animals. a colony of cope\u2019s gray treefrogs presented in October 2018 for severe attrition of unknown etiology. the colony consisted of wild-caught frogs used for auditory research. the affected frogs were found dead with no previous clinical signs. all 3 frogs submitted for molecular diagnostics were negative for ranavirus. the colony collapse was attributed to chytridiomycosis. the colony collapse was attributed to chytridiomycosis. pulmonary lesions in all of these mice (15/15) were characterized by histiocytic and neutrophilic interstitial pneumonia with alveolar histiocytosis and pulmonary edema. one of 15 mice had concurrent eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia. 9 of 15 mice had pulmonary arterial hypertrophy with mild neutrophilic arteritis. rhesus macaques with cardiomyopathies have a higher VHS than those without cardiomyopathies. we hypothesize that rhesus macaques with cardiomyopathies have a higher VHS than those without cardiomyopathies and VHS could replace echocardiography as a screening tool. a VHS of 10.25 yields an AUC of 0.64 with sensitivity of 60.5% and specificity of 71.3%. the RL view may have some benefit in the clinical assessment. but VHS did not replace the need for echocardiography. the livers contained multiple, variably sized, tan nodules throughout all lobes. histology revealed necrotizing hepatitis (11/15, 73%), splenic and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis (15/15, 100%), glomerular histiocytosis (6/15, 40%), and metritis (5/10, 50%) a 5-y-old, 5.67 kg, white rabbit presented for red urine. the rabbit arrived as a 2-y-old retired breeder from a vendor. a urine dipstick test confirmed the presence of blood. vascular hamartomas are nonneoplastic, disorganized proliferations of vascular tissue that are thought to be congenital and typically do not cause clinical disease. the clinical signs observed in this case stem from an overlap of the conditions of endometrial venous aneurysm and vascular hamartoma. fecal flotation is the best method for detecting this parasite as eggs are accidently swallowed, although this method failed to detect the parasite. the direct life cycle of this parasite enables it to persist in highly dense populations where animals are interacting with cage mates. ocele protocol refinements include perioperative supportive care of the ewe, surgical and anesthetic techniques to minimize fetal stress, preterm delivery and resuscitation of neonatal lambs. we emphasize the challenge of reproducibility in large animal surgical literature, the importance of interdepartmental collaboration. nuclear scintigraphy of the lymphatics showed evidence of a lymphatic blockage at the level of the popliteal lymph node. the dog was therefore removed from the original study. a followup project was developed to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal treatment approach to clear the infection. a 2-y-old female cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) of mauritian origin was reported for acute, seizure-like activity. the animal had been evaluated 6 wk prior with no abnormalities noted on complete physical, neurologic, and ophthalmologic examinations. the animal was moderately responsive with decreased activity and sluggish ambulation. the occurrence of spontaneous brain neoplasms in cynomolgus macaques is rare. the occurrence of spontaneous brain neoplasms in cynomolgus macaques is rare. tricaine submersion can be effectively used for at least 3 times, along with secondary confirmation for Xenopus euthanasia. hypothermia is recommended for some fish, specifically small tropical or subtropical fish. fish were moved to a recovery tank and the number of fish recovered up to 180 minutes was recorded. no fish showed signs of stress. time to loss of muscle movement and operculation cessation were not significantly different between groups. differential diagnoses included primary infection, trauma with associated infection, and altered water quality parameters. tests included cultures, blood work, necropsies, and histopathology. the primary cause of morbidity was determined to be gas supersaturation. five CD1 mice naturally infected with S. muris were used per group. mice were euthanized and gastrointestinal samples were sent for histological examination. no treatment of fenbendazole, metronidazole or a combination of therapeutics were effective. patency defines the functional life of a JVC; therefore, it is important to examine potentially contributing factors such as catheter tip shape and maintenance. each JVC is made of 3-french polyurethane; 2 have a rounded tip, and 1 has a bullet tip. thelium of laboratory mice was historically described in immunompromised mice without ascribing definitive etiology. a novel mouse kidney parvovirus (MKPV) was the cause of this inclusion body-associated nephropathy. PCR was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded kidney sections using primer sets targeting NS1 of MKPV. all the mouse kidney sections tested positive for MKPV. the results demonstrate the existence of MKPV in our facility. cesarean section resulted in at least 1 live-born infant in 71.4% of cases (5/7), of which the majority of infants were fostered to a lactating surrogate female. further research will determine additional risk factors for the need to perform cesarean sections in marmosets. a follow up study was performed in another set of 6 healthy male guinea pigs with every 8 h dosing at 1.88mg orally for 4 d, compared to 3 saline only controls. a follow up study was performed in another set of 6 healthy male guinea pigs with every 8 h dosing at 1.88mg orally for 4 d. mice were monitored for clinical progression of the masses. pyogranulomatous inflammation secondary to bacterial infection, sterile pyogranulomatous inflammation, or neoplasia. mouse kidney parvovirus (MKPV, also known as mouse chapparvovirus, MuCPV) is highly genetically divergent from other mouse parvoviruses, such as minute virus of mice (MVM) and mouse parvovirus (MPV) viral infection results in inclusion body nephropathy and renal fibrosis, leading to chronic renal disease. at least 5 animals per room were tested, and at least 1 animal was tested from each gnotobiotic isolator. commercial colonies, including those at Asian production partners, tested MKPV-negative. the specific pathogens in our test panel were selected from relatively recent publications. rogs devoid of infectious diseases in our test panel are characterized as \u201cspecific-pathogen free\u201d three of the assays broadly detect many species within their respective genera (i.e. Ranavirus, Chlamydophila spp and Cryptosporidium spp) cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) showed significant hemorrhage via ultrasound. an intravenous catheter was placed in the right saphenous vein. a 6-cm midline abdominal incision was made and the cranial abdomen was packed with gauze. postoperative hematocrit showed significant anemia. NCG mouse carries a human-like variant of the sirpa gene which permits xenotransplantation of immature hematopoietic stem cells. the process of humanization can carry with it side effects of irradiation dose and the eventual onset and development of xenogenic graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) using a handheld ketone meter, we calculated a cageside cumulative score. this was compared to a subjective assessment of morbidity or moribundity. this helped to determine preemptive euthanasia prior to animals becoming moribund. this helped to reduce pain and distress associated with GvHD. no published reference ranges exist for blood ketones in the rhesus macaque. this reference range will be an invaluable resource for the management of diabetic macaques and will enable prompt detection and treatment of DKA in the rhesus macaque. a foreign body (hair shaft) was found as the core of 1 liver lesion. culture of the vehicle and all of its individual components showed no growth. however, culture of the serosanguinous abdominal fluid revealed Proteus mirabilis. all 3 groups ingested acetaminophen doses that were higher than the 200 mg/kg targeted therapeutic dose. the AW group ingesting the lowest average daily dose (350.9 mg/kg), and the AG group ingesting the highest average daily dose (619.6 mg/kg). there was no significant difference among the groups for the average daily acetaminophen dose ingested. light readings in the holding and procedure rooms were set at acceptable light levels according to the guide prior to animal occupancy. the vendor also reported high light levels in the area where the rats had undergone surgery. additional procedures have been put in place to ensure maximum acceptable light levels are not exceeded. rats were to be introduced to liquid diet 24 h prior to surgery and maintained on it for 8 d postoperatively. 85% of the RYGB animals (n=6 of 7) exhibited acute respiratory issues including coughing, open mouthed breathing, and wet/raspy breathing sounds. animals were euthanized and gross necropsy showed intact surgical sites. the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a valuable animal model for multiple areas of biomedical research, including neuroscience and immunology. the common marmoset is a valuable animal model for multiple areas of biomedical research, including neuroscience and immunology. hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were high compared to other parameters. the i-STAT blood parameters in the common marmoset were high. this study has generated the first clinical reference ranges. pale-tan nodules were adhered to the intestinal serosa, pancreas, hepatic capsule, and ovarian bursa. epithelial population was composed of cuboidal to columnar cells arranged in acini and tubules surrounded by poorly differentiated neoplastic cells with 21 mitoses in 10 HPFs. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and administered sustained-release meloxicam at 4 mg/kg or saline followed by a routine ovariectomy. postoperative behaviors were assessed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. the hooves and pads of swine in a research setting are treated and maintained differently than those cared for in a farm or production setting. length and condition of toes along with the health of the pads are 2 of the biggest concerns when housing swine. mice are regularly evaluated for signs of disease in mouse models of prion disease. observations are carried out weekly beginning at 90 d postintracerebroventricular inoculation with prion protein. the experimental endpoint is reached when an animal is displaying fulminant disease, as defined by 5 or more signs of disease for 3 consecutive examinations. the gnotobiotic foundation colony showed a significant decrease in disease incidence over the period of 2014-2016. the gnotobiotic foundation colony showed a significant delay in disease onset and decrease in disease incidence in 2015. by 2015, our foundation colony was refreshed as scheduled and gradually replaced the production colony during 2016-2017. the new production colony exhibited significantly earlier onset and much higher incidence compared to the old one. the new production colony exhibited significantly earlier onset and much higher incidence compared to the old one. a low-cost active scavenged anesthesia system differs from passively scavenged anesthesia systems by the presence of a vacuum. the nosecone was evaluated by our safety office and determined to be as effective as commercially available versions. to date, we have built and distributed over 70 mouse anesthesia nosecones. 20 clinically infected mice were submitted, of which 55% (n=11) had histological lesions consistent with suppurative bronchopneumonia, meningitis, enteritis, hepatitis, metritis. Kp was cultured from pulmonary abscesses and/or blood samples from 10 animals. most Kp isolates (5/6) did not exhibit a hyperviscous phenotype and were resistant to TMS (5/7) dystocia and hindlimb paralysis were suspected to be due to sciatic nerve impingement. a cesarean section was performed and the animal remained in cage housing for approximately 3 wk until adequate mobility was obtained. the animal was subsequently placed in an indoor enclosure within the social group for an additional 2 wk until adequate mobility was obtained. female Xenopus laevis presented with a 1cm x 1cm subcutaneous mass in the left cervicoscapular area. the frog had been used for a single nonsurgical oocyte collection between July and august 2018. a different frog in the colony was noted to have a similar subcutaneous mass, but was euthanized by the lab without further evaluation. the maternal animal was found to have a bicornuate uterus with 2 distinct uterine horns sharing 1 uterine body and cervix. the maternal animal was also found to have unilateral renal agenesis, a sequela common to women with this congenital uterine abnormality. us appeared to worsen over the past 12 mo. previous treatment include omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin E supplementation. previous treatment include omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E supplementation. study evaluated 3 different antiseptic preparation agents that simplify application and/or cost compared to standard triplicate application of povidone-iodine and alcohol. mice were shaved on the dorsum and culture swabs were taken for RODAC plating and bacterial identification. a clear criterion for defining aged mice has not been established. male and female C57BL/6 (C57BL/6NCrSlc(B6N), C57BL/6J(B6J) mice (4-wk-old) were purchased every 3 mo and kept over their lifetime. blood tests showed that the total WBC count started to decline at around 18 mo and the composition of WBC tended to change with age in both mice. crossfostering has been used to eradicate Helicobacter spp, murine norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, and mouse encephalomyelitis in laboraotry mice. a 15-y-old male rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) on a neuroscience protocol, and 1-wk post cranial implant revision, presented with acute lethargy and anorexia. clinical signs progressed to dull mentation, trembling, ataxia, and head pressing. a bacterial culture of the implant margin grew Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. neurosonography could be expanded clinically for diagnosing and monitoring encephalopathies in chronically implanted animals with lesions directly underneath or very close to the craniotomy site. rats housed in wire bottom cages with alpha cellulose bedding for 6 mo showed 44% of single (n=80) and 36% (n=89) of pair-housed rats developed hind foot lesions. body weights were taken monthly and foot lesions were scored monthly on a 0-3 scale. at 5 mo, 17% of single- and 3% of pair-housed rats developed foot lesions compared to 8% with round shelters. complete necropsies were performed on 16 of the affected mice. skeletal myodegeneration, necrosis and mineralization were identified in 12 of 16 mice. potential differential diagnoses for the myocardial and skeletal muscle lesions include toxicity, renal disease, paraneoplastic syndrome, endocrine disease. marmoset breeding and medical records from pregnant and nonpregnant females were retrospectively examined. values for pregnant and nonpregnant healthy animals were compared using a student\u2019s t test (nonpregnant n=148 chemistry panels from 44 females) a comparison of staple versus suture incisional closure was conducted. 10 rats had their laparotomy incision sites closed using skin sutures. no differences in postsurgical appearance, behavior or posteuthanasia incision area histopathology were observed between the two groups. natural infections typically occur in young and immunosuppressed mice. infection is typically pantropic with virus recovered from liver, brain, heart, pancreas, spleen, lymph nodes, and blood vessels. three tumor seeds transplanted into affected mice tested positive for reovirus by PCR. these cases highlight unusual lesions, specifically adrenal, tail, and ovarian necrosis. outbreak history, clinical and pathologic findings will be presented. records revealed a late onset, creeping hypercapnia, tachycardia, and hyperthermia which were unresponsive to hyperventilation, isoflurane manipulations, and temperature adjustments. the gold standard intervention for malignant hyperthermia, dantrolene, was not available for use. uremia peaked between 48 and 120 h but returned to normal by 30 d postoperative. the syndrome occurred predominantly in younger animals; 15/21 were 2-3 y of age at time of necropsy. all but 1 of the animals were derived from the same source colony. clinical signs included vomiting (17/21), diarrhea (18/21) and weight loss or poor weight gain (21/21) no infectious etiology was identified based on bacterial culture, histopathology, and electron microscopy of gall bladder and duodenum. this novel duodenal mucosal ulceration and stricture syndrome in a young adult marmoset cohort is being investigated. guinea pigs are prone to metastatic or dystrophic calcification. heterotopic bone formation is a unique clinical entity characterized by the presence of functional bone marrow. this lesion has been reported in aging pet guinea pigs. ivermectin treatment failed with commercially available fipronil spray. new shipments of snakes arrived from various sources. new shipments of snakes arrived from various sources. tattoo inks contain microbial contaminants that may initiate or contribute to inflammation and infection at the tattoo site. the tattoo inks also contain detectable levels of heavy metals. lesions continued to progress, with the animal developing hyperkeratosis and vesicular dermal lesions along the dorsum. the animal was sedated for collection of skin biopsies and blood for scabies ELISA. mice have differing standardized intestinal microbiota that represent the microbial spectrum of that seen in contemporary rodent colonies. these colonies can be used as embryo transfer surrogates for derivation of any mouse model of disease that possess one or more desired GM profiles. we have shown that composition of the resident GM is a primary determinant of disease severity in models ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to autism. one company\u2019s optimization solution is to use \u201cpie-shaped\u201d cages placed on a rotating carousel rack. this creates a smaller footprint per 100 cages as compared to traditional shoebox caging systems. this design mimics extended family groups, which is consistent with naturalistic social conditions. shaped configuration (single or conjoined) had a negative effect on pup survival and weight gain. after head-cap preparation, rats are generally individually housed to reduce the risk of damage caused by chewing. mouse gut microbiome AF Hoggatt*1, C Hallman3, A Ericsson2, CL Franklin2 1Center for Comparative Medicine, Boston, MA; 2University of Missouri, Columbia, MO; 3Boston University, Boston, MA. changes that effect the animal\u2019s microenvironment may introduce new experimental variables to ongoing research. the presence of intestinal parasites is a persistent problem in colonies of laboratory mice. the pinworms Syphacia obvelata and Aspiculuris tetraptera are the helminths most commonly found in the intestine of laboratory mice. unused bone wax must be disposed of as it is no longer considered sterile. labs stored excess wax in foil packaging and placed it inside a reclosable plastic bag for later use. this does not comply with our institutional survival surgery policy. to determine the new amount of feed needed per cage we used our maximum number of adult mice allowed per cage and the frequency we normally change cages out (5 mice for 7 d) our technicians monitor the feed daily as part of their daily animal health observations and normally add feed only when weekly cage changes are performed. plastic sheeting is used as the floor of the cage and is secured to the outside of the walls using duct tape. the prototype cage proved functional, customizable, easy to assemble and disassemble by 1 person. the plastic floor collects all waste within the cage and greatly reduces cleanup time. positive cultures were repeated once to correct for sampling error. flushing WG for 20 sec before use decreased positive culture results by 66%. zebrafish consume a varied diet, many of which are not accessible in a laboratory setting. the fish fed E diet, S+G diet or E+G diet, reached reproductive maturity length of 23 mm 3 wk sooner than the G diet and 1 wk sooner than the S diet. the fish fed E diet, S+G diet or E+G diet, also weighed 67% more than the G diet, 39% more than the S diet and 20% more than E diet. we evaluated the total absorbent capacity of the two beddings by immersion in water (20 ml, n=5 per bedding, per time point). we then measured the instantaneous absorption by dripping a fixed volume of water through a column of bedding which allowed nonabsorbed fluid to pass through. smart cages provide high-quality husbandry for the many cages of mice in our facility. the smart cage uses electromagnetic field technology to monitor the bedding condition, animal activity, and water levels of each cage. the cages require a learning phase, which is used to build an algorithm based on the facility\u2019s standards. 5 mice per box are changed on an average of 16 d compared to every 7 d. reducing labor hours used in animal room and cage wash, water used in cage wash, bedding and energy used in cash wash by approximately 55%. many institutions are pursuing the establishment of small-scale germfree and gnotobiotic research operations within existing laboratories or vivarium spaces. use of our methods and principles may offer established and developing small scale germfree rodent facilities ways to integrate new and existing housing systems. quarantats are inexpensive and safe disinfectants for most surfaces and widely used in laboratory animal facilities for sanitization. all diluted quat bottles initially tested between 700-850ppm. the water tested at 0ppm and the concentrate at greater than 1000ppm. the bottles were stored in a temperature-controlled, secure area with a 12/12 light/dark cycle. the committee implemented several initiatives including the use of a reusable single cup coffee brewing container in the break room, along with reusable dishes and mugs. euthanasia cards averaged 439 per week while food bags averaged 104 per week. ninety-five percent of the staff surveyed either felt fulfilled or that they were making a difference. animals with destructible enrichment provided immediately after surgery compared to postsurgical animals with our standard enrichment (stainless steel rattle, jingle ball, and dumbbell) the decrease resulted in a monetary savings of $13.85 as well as 30 min of staff time per collar replaced. more than half (n=9) use autoclaved bedding. cotton nestlets (n=13) and a standard rodent diet (n=6) were the most commonly mentioned. the ohio health doctor is aware of the changes and expects to see a decline in work injuries. the committee has made great strides in improving the work flow and creating innovative, simple solutions to some of our biggest problems. study found paper-based bedding decreased ammonia levels compared to corn cob bedding for mice housed in individually ventilated mouse cages. paper-based bedding decreased ammonia levels compared to corn cob bedding for mice. cob bedding, n=8 cages/group, males = 5 cages/group, females = 3 cages/group) no effect on intracage ammonia or CO2 levels with any of the paper-based bedding amounts compared to corn cob bedding, when controlled for days post change, mouse sex, and repeated sampling for each cage. the decision to euthanize was made due to complications associated with cardiovascular disease, Pastuerella, or neoplasia. the chronic feeding of alfalfa based diet can be safely accomplished in New Zealand White rabbits without increasing the chance of developing renal complications. a wide range of acceptable humidity levels for murine vivariums from 30-70%. the humidity increased in the mouse housing room to as high as 85%. the embryo yield from donor females would conversely decrease from 70% to 0%. highest embryo yield is within a humidity level of 35%-65%. staff is responsible for husbandry and housekeeping of animal rooms. PIs can focus on grants and less on study and personnel lab management. the use of enrichment is important for laboratory rodent models to reduce stress, abnormal/aggressive behaviors, and provide temperature regulation. we evaluated the efficacy of a half-sized twisted paper enrichment in 3 strains/stocks of mice. no statistical significance was observed in nest scores between the cages containing the full-sized or half-sized enrichment within the stocks/strains. the number and size of pups per litter was recorded in the breeding cages and weekly body weights were assessed in the cages. daily rounds were coordinated between veterinary and lab members to check the colony simultaneously, minimizing disturbance as much as possible. the birds responded well to these adjustments; they now have more time to eat undisturbed, and the incidence of opportunistic infections in the colony decreased to less than 3%. each strip (stain portion only) is cut into 5 equal pieces and preloaded into 1ml or 3 ml syringes fitted with syringe cap. technician can simply take 1 syringe each morning and fill with sterile saline, then use the solution for all cases that day. system was created to prepare the fluorescein stain in advance. our best practices are cataloged in a website sorted by the general body part that they will mostly benefit. some of the general best practices included keeping a natural wrist position while holding tools like an ear notcher or tail clipping scissors. some of the general best practices include dividing out specific tasks throughout the week and taking micro-breaks. there are no known disinfectants that can substantially penetrate dry biofilm. chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, and peracetic acid have had challenges affecting even the easier-to-treat wet biofilm. biotransformations, uptake, and production of metabolites are all biochemical pathways of metabolism that can be studied by employing metabolic caging that allows for the separate collection of both feces and urine. a common problem with metabolic caging is contamination with food particles that drop through the mesh cage flooring. traditional methods can provide robust monitoring of the quality of animal care. some of the traditional methods, such as supervisor observation or auditing against SOPs test knowledge of processes can be stressful and also do not monitor the performance of employees not being directly observed. the program was well received and increased employee engagement. the water provided to mice is treated through an animal water purification system designed to remove microorganisms, metals, and suspended materials from water. the first step in assessing the performance of a water system is to evaluate water quality over time. the customized change stations were customized so technicians have easy access to necessary supplies including gloves, sleeves, disinfectants, paper towels, food, cage cards, and logs. animal technicians recorded the time it took to complete routine cage changes using both old and new processes from initial setup to end of cleanup. isolators are constructed of polyurethane material and are completely sealed when the port caps are in place. they are perfectly suited as individual chambers to accommodate the chlorine dioxide gas without exposure to personnel. a port cap is modified to accommodate our gas generator connections. mice were exposed to an average fluctuation of 7.5\u00b0C during transportation from our facility in Michigan to 7 institutions in the northeast, midwest, south, and southwestern regions of the united states in April and may 2019. a 2-wk trial was conducted to compare the nest quality with 1 dental roll (n=70 cages) versus 2 cotton squares (n=70 cages) the trial was then expanded to a room with 800 cages, all receiving a dental roll weekly for 30 d. 9 adult mice were found with leg strictures associated with tangled dental roll fibers. the trial was discontinued due to leg strictures associated with tangled dental roll fibers. IVC Plenum Sanitation A Sparks*, K Nolan, C Martin, D Harrison, D Coble, C Ayres, JM Hickman-Davis Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. the manufacturer provided a 2-inch round head brush on a 6-foot flexible extension rod for removal of dust and rust in 59% of vertical rack plenums. rodent facilities must sterilize all food and water which is fed to their animals to ensure they continually exclude bacteria, viruses, mold, and fungi from these populations. most commonly, water is sterilized by autoclaving small quantities in glass bottles for both isolator and gnotobiotic cage systems. these bottles are subsequently submerged in sterilant baths before introduction into the GF/GN housing units. reuse would reduce cost to $40/isolator/year which could result in significant cost savings especially in larger, higher-throughput facilities. guinea pig caging was reallocated to a different campus only to have our program needs shift. guinea pig caging was reallocated to a different campus only to have our program needs shift. our initial solution was open-topped, rugged plastic tubs capable of housing 8-12 adult guinea pigs. the tubs were furnished with plastic huts, manipulanda, and feeding and watering devices. a 75% decrease in sleeping and hiding behaviors coupled with a 4-fold increase in active behaviors such as playing, exploring, and eating. the animals continued active behaviors regardless of the presence of staff in the room. rotifers can be propagated and maintained at a salinity of 5g/L. rotifers can be nutritionally enriched with an irradiated powdered larval diet. rotifers can be maintained successfully on powdered larval diet alone at densities of >1000 rotifers/mL. corridors were color coded to indicate supply needs for the color of the week. the associated corridors\u2019 supply carts were labeled with a large color-coded, autoclavable tag indicating the room number. our processes further evolved to improve PI cage supply orders, and to include other scheduled facility tasks. disinfectant wipes have varying claims on product efficacy and usability. using manufacturer guidelines on each product, we evaluated ease of use, user feedback, and efficacy of disinfectant via ATP testing. implementing these practices would be recommended for application in animal care facilities. the facility has undergone a rapid growth over the last 5 y. a rodent census increase of 25% and significant changes in our facilities. veterinary staff have developed a low-cost, electronic, real-time reporting system for health case management and medical recordkeeping. the system removes these duplicative steps and requires a 1-time entry. veterinary staff can be notified of a new health case at any time or location. the program allows animal care technicians to attach pictures for improved communication to veterinary staff in a decentralized facility environment. electronically entered data can be easily forwarded to the investigator, improving the speed of communication and reducing duplicative steps. regular diet + corncob bedding (99.72 14.28 mg/ml), regular diet + paper bedding (88.83 12.16 mg/ml), high-fat diet + corncob bedding (205 61.83 mg/ml), and 60% high-fat diet + paper bedding (191.17 65.96 mg/ml). paper bedding can provide a good alternative to the commonly used corncob bedding without compromising research outcomes. cross-foster rederivation has been used successfully in laboratory mice to clear pathogens such as MNV, Helicobacter, and MHV. however, we could not find any literature to support whether cross-foster rederivation was successful between 2 different species of Mus. management is now spending only 10 min a week on the schedule and technicians are able to understand their daily responsibilities without missing tasks. the schedule was 6 pages long. the technicians were responsible for making their own cages for their rooms. our autoclave went through major renovations and the manufacture of the new components said finalizing the IFSS would void warranty on our autoclave. in addition to the IFSS we installed a safety gate. this gate will prevent the door from closing and not allow the machine to run. new Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are a social species and per regulatory and welfare standards, should be housed in groups or pairs whenever possible. social housing is the possibility of food hoarding by the dominant rabbit, preventing the subordinate rabbits adequate access to necessary resources thus confounding longitudinal age-weight matched studies. reducing stress is important from a welfare perspective, and a scientific perspective to reduce confounding factors. reducing stress is important from a welfare perspective, and a scientific perspective to reduce confounding factors. all mice had the highest corticosterone levels immediately after shipping from the vendor. hand carried mice were higher than mice transported by cart or the control group the day following transport. no significant hematological changes in mice transported by hand or cart compared to the control group at day 18. patterned after updated practices developed and used by peer universities. applied a formula to simplify cost categorization between per diem and special service recharges. compared results with current rates derived from the legacy system. automated home cage monitoring of mice is a new technology that provides insights on how microenvironment, husbandry practices, and enrichment may affect animal welfare and behavior. in a second experiment, adult female SW mice (3/cage) were housed in IVC under 5 different bedding conditions (soft cellulose bedding, corn cob bedding, paper chip bedding, and soft cellulose bedding) mice housed with plastic huts showed the highest activity followed by no enrichment, cotton fiber squares, paper-huts, plastic tubes, and nesting material pucks. activity levels were significantly higher in cages with plastic huts compared to cages with paper-huts, plastic tubes, and nesting material pucks. mice are used in the development of xenograft and patient derived tumor models to research novel medicines intended to treat various human cancers. in 2018, we unexpectedly experienced high morbidity and mortality in an NSG mouse colony housed in barrier conditions. a new card system was developed for colonies of mice with rectal prolapse due to research-related or phenotypic issues. once a grade 2 rectal prolapse is observed, a veterinary staff member places a laminated rectal prolapse card on the cage. the card is flipped and on the opposite side is a request for the lab to euthanize along with the date and time of deadline. vivarium access has benefited both investigative and veterinary technical staff by increasing cage-side communication and decreasing excess paperwork. new research personnel drives the need to provide vivarium access. initial access requests typically require verification that medical, training, and security requirements are complete. effective compliance and animal facility administration software (CAFA) can provide significant operational efficiencies and cost savings for animal research facilities. the transition impacted all aspects of IACUC and IBC protocol management, financial, and animal facility management. lab animal holding facility, or vivarium, is a purpose-built building to accommodate research animals and exclude deleterious agents. it is possible to transition a large academic animal resource program to a new software in a limited timeframe. some of the bacterial agents identified in the hollow space were also detected in animals in the facility. this investigation highlights the importance of proper construction of vivarium doors and the risks associated with all hollow spaces within the vivaria. reusing gamma irradiated feed remaining in the hopper at the time of cage change would reduce overall costs while not impacting animal health. we disposed of any remaining feed in the hopper every 14 d when the cage was changed. chinchillas are often used for auditory research due to their accessible tympanic bullae and similarities to the human hearing range. the chinchillas were housed in modified rabbit caging with custom-cut plexiglass solid flooring placed over a portion of the existing cage floor. the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is known as the most fertile anthropoid primate due to its multiparous tendencies, relatively short gestation (mean=143-144 d), and absence of a lactational anoestrus period. most of the endocrinologic tests used for pregnancy detection in humans and Old World primates are unreliable in marmosets. our facility implemented a benchmark of 50 cage changes per hour (50ccph) using the traditional time and motion studies with current staff. each preceding week, the care staff provides estimated time needed for technical responsibilities along with the number of cages they will be changing in their assigned area for the following week\u2019s workload. rat pinworm eggs were collected from privately owned rats using double-sided cellophane tape. they were allocated to control, ultrasonic fogging, or soaking in liquid chlorine dioxide groups prior to incubation in hatching media. the use of double-sided tape for collection, evaluation, and incubation increased the efficiency of experiments. potential contamination sources include microbial contamination and leaching of inorganic compounds from water bottle stoppers. inorganic mineral content was well below national drinking water maximum contaminant levels established by the eu. our department has extended the limit for storage of rodent water bottles from 7 to 14 d. this study represents an evidence-based approach to reducing potable water waste in a laboratory animal facility. the approaches outlined will serve as a resource for animal care and use programs required to house and breed species novel to their vivaria. lean management is a popular model for efficient vivarium operations at biomedical research organizations around the world. the toolkit is comprised of 11 tools: 5S scoring sheets, 5 \u201cwhys\u201d sheet, fishbone Analysis, A3 problem-solving Worksheet, impact-effort matrix, go and see/gemba form, downtimw, standard work template, stakeholder analysis, plus-delta template, and control chart template. the tools, techniques, and assistance offered by the toolkit can equip managers with the confidence and capability to improve operations, efficiency, quality, and create an organizational culture of excellence. our husbandry technician time is dedicated to feeding primates and daily cleaning of cages and rooms. facility staff can use mobile phones to collect census and other data. a cage label can be printed on a self-service terminal printer by any user with a valid account ID. the system is wechat and internet accessible for ease of use. the study was conducted using CD-1 female mice housed 5 per cage. there were 10 cages of animals with 1 cage being a sham. the mice were fed pelleted rodent diet. mice housed on corn cob bedding showed a significant difference in increased FBG levels versus those housed on wood chip bedding. the results confirm the earlier UCLA study that mice housed on corn cob bedding showed a significant difference in increased FBG levels. baboons from the divided group were showing increased frustration and stress when they would witness their former cohorts involved in an even minor altercation. this behavior would have a domino effect eventually leading to all corrals becoming agitated and aggressive, sometimes leading to injuries that require medical attention. incorporating these large, colonywide visual barriers is beneficial for occluding negative visual interactions between neighboring groups. the husbandry team uses surplus seasonal produce and donations from the community to take advantage of what is already available from the public. weekly schedules are used to ensure a variety of foods are provided and rotated daily to avoid repetition. adjustments are also made as needed to accommodate specific research breeding groups which may require specific diets. a response rate of 79% was obtained with a majority being females (75%) and with more than 5 years of experience (52%). gloved hands alone were preferred overall (82%) compared to forceps alone (15%) and both gloved hands and forceps (3%) SOPs are fluid procedures that are constantly evolving and authority for managing SOPs and the scope of subjects vary between institutions. an approach for SOP creation, review, implementation and training has been developed. the greatest challenge at our facility is completion of a timely review. a large colony of 100 randomly sourced sled dogs are housed indoors for research purposes. the sled dogs are simultaneously exercised outdoors in 3 separate fenced play yards twice daily. many challenges faced developing an appropriate exercise regime such as playgroup compatibility to avoid dog fights. the refined procedure reduces the cost of wrapping a cylinder by about $190 per year just in high-temperature tape. the amount of time it takes to wrap a cylinder was also reduced by about 20 min per cylinder depending on the technician wrapping it. the germfree shipping container is ethylene oxide sterilized in a blue surgical wrap material. on the ship date, the germfree shipping container and mice are placed in the hood aseptically. a technician in sterile PPE then moves the mice from the iso-positive cage into the sterile cages used in the germfree shipping container. each pup is entered into the electronic colony management system and given a unique six-digit animal ID. all pups that require genotype analysis are then tattooed by well-trained personnel at P5-12 and at the same time, a small tail biopsy is taken for genotype analysis. this system allows for optimal usage of animal cage space in a complex transgenic mouse breeding colony. rat MI tops across all ventilation systems had significantly elevated bacterial counts compared to mouse MI tops at 14 days (P = 2.207e-06) mouse MI top total CFU were also stable across multiple ventilation systems yet remained lower than 50 CFU until at least 90 d. only a necessary number of females and vasectomized males were introduced into the facility to be used in the surgical implantation of cryopreserved embryos. ongoing mouse production efforts rely solely on internal embryo transfer and vasectomy surgeries in a specially designed operating room. ongoing mouse production efforts rely solely on internal embryo transfer and vasectomy surgeries in a specially designed operating room. entire rodent drinking water supply line needed to be replaced, a process that would culminate in 3-4 d in which no water would be delivered to our rodent colony spanning 2 buildings. operations and husbandry teams explored several options and made the critical choice for temporary water delivery: gel pouches. alterations in microbiome are associated with multiple disease states. diet composition has been shown to impact fecal microbiome. fecal and oral samples were collected before diet change and 2.5 wk after change from a representative subset of beagles. modification to maintain appropriate body condition decreased from 34.3% to 12.9%. this is the first study to investigate the microbiome of laboratory beagles. infected mice were euthanized at 3, 8, or 21 days post-inoculation. an increase in PEA formation was confirmed in the salivary gland at all post-inoculation timepoints. no alternate sites of platelet sequestration were noted. aicensis is used as an animal model for several viruses, including MERS-CoV, dengue virus, Zika virus, and Tacaribe virus. the study sought to establish hematologic baseline reference intervals in an apparently healthy, captive population of Jamaican fruit bats. the rabbit model helped elucidate the development of the subsynovial connective tissue. the subsynovial connective tissue in the carpal tunnel undergoes marked morphological changes. the subsynovial connective tissue in the carpal tunnel undergoes marked morphological changes. a method development study was conducted in preparation for 2 developmental and reproductive toxicology studies involving male and female fertility. the studies were to receive daily doses for a minimum of 8 weeks (males) and between 3 and 5 weeks (females) jugular catheters attached to externalized ports with magnetic protective caps were evaluated. a mouse must undergo 2 surgical procedures, a unilateral nephrectomy with a subsequent 2/3 nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney. a potential refinement to this renal failure model is a 3/4 reduction in renal mass conducted as a single surgical procedure. the aim of this study was to evaluate these 2 surgical models of kidney failure. mice in the 3/4 nephrectomy group had lower blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine with a higher urine creatinine and kidney to body weight ratio. these results are consistent with a more severe compromise to renal function in the 5/6 nephrectomy surgical model of renal failure. hexosaminidase B encodes a protein, beta-hexosaminidase B, that catalyzes lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids and other macromolecules. the putative mutation, Hexblysd, was predicted to be in-frame and result in deletion of 2 amino acids from the protein. the prevalence of genotoxin-encoding E. coli in cats is unknown. cyclomodulin genotoxins colibactin (pks), hemolysin-associated cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf) and cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) are associated with intestinal inflammation and cancer, urinary tract infection, and septicemia. PCR was performed to determine the presence of pks, cnf, and cdt genes. 12 of the 28 isolates (42.9%) were pks+, 13 (46.4%) were cnf+, and 10 (35.7%) were cdt+. most isolates encoded multiple cytotoxin genes. sepsis has a mortality rate of 28.6%, resulting in about 215,000 american deaths per year. 80% of the buprenorphine HCl mice surviving for 14 d. 80% of the buprenorphine HCl mice surviving for 14 d. male mice produce courtship ultrasonic vocalizations in response to female urine termed female urine-induced male mice ultrasonic vocalizations (FiUSV) mice produced FiUSV 4 of the 5 d (143 93 syllables, mean SD) and underwent vasectomy or sham surgery. vasectomized mice treated with buprenorphine and sham-surgery mice had no change in FiUSV from baseline at any time point after surgery. a decrease in FiUSV can detect decreased animal well-being at least 4 h after vasectomy in rats. mechanical (von Frey monofilament) and thermal (Hargreaves method) hypersensitivity was tested daily and analyzed on days -1, 1, 2, and 3. Consumed tablet postoperatively was 101-133 mg/kg for gabapentin, 5.5-5.8 mg/kg for carprofen, and 86-137/1.9-3 mg/kg for gabapentin/carprofen. both the gabapentin and carprofen groups attenuated mechanical hyper use of PMSG was aimed to promote superovulation and increase the number of offspring produced. study hypothesized elimination of PMSG would not have a significant negative impact on the reproductive performance of transgenic rabbits. elimination of a PMSG treatment regime may have a positive effect on the overall reproductive performance of the transgenic NZW rabbits. this study suggests that removal of PMSG is an option to consider in a commercial rabbit breeding operation regardless of the availability of commercially approved PMSG. BM-MSCs transfected CD81/OCLN or CD81/OCLN/miR-122 to infect the cells. the addition of exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could enhance its infectivity to HCV, the HCV virus load is up to 105 copies/mL and HCV Core antigen could be detected in the above cell culture. no research has examined how various methods of providing nest material may influence mouse behavior and welfare. we predicted that distributing nest material around the cage would allow mice equal access to the material, thereby reducing aggression. the signature injury of modern warfare is blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) due to the use of explosive devices. the clinical symptoms of BINT have been correlated with neuropathology including hemorrhage, neuronal necrosis, and increased paracellular permeability of the blood-brain barrier. a survivable Liver Biopsy Procedure in Mice to Assess Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Resolution C Rivera*1, S Oldham2 1AST, Astrazeneca, Clarksburg, MD; 2Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Diseases, Astrazeneca, Gaithersburg, MD Clinical trials assessing therapies for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis involve a baseline and end of study liver biopsy, and assessment of improvement in disease endpoint 118 mice were biopsied and 49 of those excluded due to low or high fibrosis. the remainder of the mice were sorted into groups for treatment. a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment improved fibrosis. buprenorphine HCl 1.8mg/ml is an FDA-approved veterinary drug labeled for 24-h analgesia in cats. in order to assess the potential use of the FDA-approved formulation in mice, we compared buprenorphine 1.8mg/ml with the compounded sustained-release buprenorphine. neonatal ferret is an attractive species in which to model preterm brain injury because it has a gyified brain with a white-to-gray matter ratio similar to the human. postnatal white matter maturation and complex cortical folding in ferret first 4 postnatal wk are equivalent to that observed in the human brain during the third trimester. a model of inflammation-sensitized HIH injury in the neonatal ferret provides a range of macroscopic injury, resulting in significant gait deficits and decreased spontaneous activity in the open field. this model can provide a platform to assess therapies for brain injury in near-term infants. we used a HER2-positve luminal B patient breast tumor resected from the metastatic site in brain to derive tumor spheres. after growth of the spheres was confirmed, the spheres were orthotopically injected (5x105cells) in 2 groups of nu/nu mice (4, 6-wk-old female, 4, 3-mo old) at cerebellum site, corresponding to the original tumor resection site. pregnant Dorset sheep at a gestational age range of 95-120 days were used. the study required blood collection from the fetus for a minimum of 7 d. two methods of fetal catheterization were performed, both accessed via hysterotomy. femoral catheterization eliminated patency issues. the length of the catheter was much greater allowing for it to be seated in the abdominal aorta/vena cava. the 3 rat models generated the Pde6B strain had the most aggressive disease with almost complete loss of the retinal outer nuclear layer by 4 weeks of age. rapid progression to end stage disease is ideal for testing novel therapeutics. a single preoperative dose of Bup HCl 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg SC effectively attenuates postoperative thermal hypersensitivity. a single preoperative dose of Bup HCl 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg SC effectively attenuates postoperative thermal hypersensitivity. the recent FDA approval of 5 immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/L1 has created the potential to significantly improve outcomes in UC patients. we aimed to quantitatively assess how much if any intravesical (IVS)-dosed CPI therapy \u201cleaks\u201d into systemic circulation. in the high volume (200uL) IVS-dosed mice, there was significant retrograde leakage via the ureters into the renal pelvis of the kidneys. radiolabeled drug exhibited normal systemic biodistribution to the liver and spleen. at lower volumes, IVS dosed-CPIs can remain in bladder with little if any leakage into systemic circulation thusensuring an optimal safety profile. male Sprague-Dawley rats (5-7 wk) were exposed to hypoxia while conscious (8-12% O2, 5 min each) or anesthetized with isoflurane (90 s, 12% O2) and cardiorespiratory parameters were measured. rats received right-sided cervical vagotomy (n=7) or sham surgery (n=7) ova were exposed to iHP fog using a whole-room fogging decontamination system in unoccupied housing rooms of 2,600 ft3 and 1,890 ft3 respectively. each room received an initial fogging injection time of 15 min at 0.5 ml/ft3/min of hydrogen peroxide. exposure to iHP fog and mist is effective in reducing hatching of siphacia spp. ova. further studies are needed to determine whether changes to exposure parameters of iHP treatments can further reduce or eliminate hatching, and infectious potential, of rodent pinworm ova. cMDVs of diluted meloxicam can remain sterile and stable for 365 d. transgenic mice become spontaneously diabetic and are used as a model of type 2 diabetes. high sensitivity ELISA assays require small amounts of serum collected from tail bleeds. a new model on the market, the B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd (R2G2) knockout mouse, lacks responsiveness to common gamma chain cytokines. multiple myeloma (MM1.S cells) were inject into 5 male mice via the tail vein at 50 x 104 cells per mouse. IVIS imaging was used to measure tumor burden of luciferase transfected MM1.S cells. tumor volume was measured twice weekly via calipers for 5 w. the FDA requires nonclinical safety assessment testing in animal models to occur before new drug products or medical devices can proceed into phase 1 human clinical trials. we postulated that other possible factors leading to unexpected animal mortality/adverse events may include underlying congenital disease, subclinical infections, experimental parameters leading to stress and stress related pathology. chera1, CE Roache1, MC Terzi1,2, T Coksaygan1,2, LJ DeTolla1,2, NL Schmidt3 1Comparative Medicine, University of Maryland, Ellicot City, MD; 2Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD; 3School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD. a potential research complication is immunosuppression which leads to unnecessary variability or discrepancies in data. fecal flotations were performed from the ceca and colons of the infested mice. no changes were observed in water consumption and suspension particles were noted in the water pouches. two cystometrograms were conducted in each sedated session. no significant differences were observed between peak pressure, bladder capacity or compliance. dexmedetomidine had the shortest time to lateral recumbency, as well as the shortest time to head up. genistein has been proposed to provide beneficial effects on health, including preventive or therapeutic actions in carcinogenesis. their structural similarity to estrogens allows them to bind at the cellular level with estrogen receptors. twenty-four nonovariectomized female SCID mice were used. the antitumoral effects of genistein were determined for 3 wk on an inflammatory mammary cancer xenograft model. no statistically significant differences in tumor size were found between control and control xenografts. 38 of 178 (21%) PDX tumors were EBV-associated human lymphoma by IHC (Immunohistochemistry) of antihuman CD20. the quantity of EBV DNA can be a predictor for PDX failure. the injection technique was refined throughout the trial to determine how far to insert the needle to ensure the microchip stayed in but not too far to injure the pup. a nonsterile approach was taken for the animals as well as the microchips. prairie voles may be useful in examining how different social stressors may affect response to acute trauma and recovery from injury. for example, disruption of social bonds has been shown to induce cardiovascular dysfunction in this species. the study generated baseline arterial blood gas and chemistry values in healthy prairie voles. it also explored the influence of anesthetic drugs on prairie vole blood parameters. all mice experienced significant and sustained weight loss during the 7-d period after placement on these diets. average weight loss exceeded 20% of baseline weight by d 6 on both diets in young mice and exceeded 20% by d 5 in the adult group given TAM. female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with a silastic capsule containing oil (n=12) or 100ng estradiol (n=9), which approximates a diestrus level. IL-1 elicited a significant reduction in LH at 120 and 180 min following administration. a significant increase in c-Fos in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), middle arcuate (mARC), ventrolateral medulla (VLM), and nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) these data suggest that estradiol affects the specific neural pathways by which stress hormones influence reproduction. acy were evaluated including quality of induction, pedal withdrawal reflex, palpebral reflex, muscle tension, and quality of recovery. the alf group had the longest immobilization time which was twice the time of Ket or Ket/Dex. the animal was anesthetized and moved to the MRI scanner. images were acquired using a 3D-TWIST sequence. the animal was placed in a broome restrainer in lateral recumbency. the animal was anesthetized and moved to the scanner. Tns2 is ubiquitously expressed in human and mice. we bred Apc deficient and Tns2 deficient mice to create combined mutation mice. however, little is known about the function of both domains. in C3H/HeJ mice we investigated whether intravaginal infection with Ct would induce a humanlike infection in the upper genital tract and cause lesions. in this study, 6 mice were randomly assigned in 2 groups. the groups of 3 mice each were either Ct infected or uninfected controls that receive buffer (SPG) mice used in a dose escalation study of Burkholdeira pseudomallei were inoculated with either 5,000, 10,000, or 2,5000 CFU. mice were observed for 3 d prior to inoculation, then at 4, 12, 20, 28, 36,45, 53, and 61 h after inoculation for the behaviors listed above, nesting activity, and body temperature. decline in nesting activity correlated well with appearance (r=0.87), activity (r=0.83), rearing (r=0.69) and body temperature (r=0.75). a negative correlation to orbital tightening (r=-0.23). mice treated with sterile swan had a statistically significant reduction in bacterial counts and diversity on their post-treatment skin swabs and fecal pellets. hypochlorous gel is a good treatment choice for UD when microbiome sparing is desired. nine rabbits were imaged on day 0 and 7 days following a surgical infection of the maxillary sinus with S. aureus. animals were either treated with saline or a novel nitric oxide based experimental compound. tremor mutant phenotype results from a recessive spontaneous mutation that arose from a colony of Swiss mice. the mutant mice did not differ from WT mice in physical and reflexology development from birth to 3 wk of age. tremor, ataxia, and spontaneous seizures can be observed around postnatal day 21. 8 animals were euthanized by decapitation and the contents of noradrenaline (NOR), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) infrared thermometers (IR) and IR imaging cameras (IC) offer an alternative to invasive techniques such as intrarectal thermometers and intracorporal implants to measure body temperature (BT) in mice. the IR devices were used to measure T in 25 obese mice (OM), averaging 54 g, and normal weight (NM) mice, averaging 26.2 g. standardization should be used to show intrinsic deviations for location, strai,n and type of research. more experiments are needed to further understand the changes and establish a standard method to reliably use IR devices. uninfested animals were treated with topical administration of imidacloprid/moxidectin or vehicle (vehicle controls) 80% of vehicle controls were negative by day 28. new testing methods include fur pluck, deep skin scrape, biopsy, and PCR assay. current testing methods include fur pluck, deep skin scrape, biopsy, and PCR assay. no clinically significant hematologic abnormalities or alterations in immunophenotype were evident in any of the strains throughout the experimental timepoints. findings align with the inherent immunophenotypes of each strain and demonstrate a need for Demodex musculi surveillance in immunocompetent mouse colonies. hematoxylin-eosin staining and RPE65 immunolabelling detected in rat lesions. progressive thinning of outer retinal layers was detected via OCT imaging throughout duration of the study. ganglion cell and nerve fiber layers were better preserved and sclera remained unaffected. this study attempts to determine if higher doses of buprenorphine can extend the duration of analgesia in mice. the same mice were treated with a single dose of 1 of 9 doses of buprenorphine (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 mg/kg), then challenged on the hot plate at 30 min, and at 4, 8, 24, 48, and 120 h. serial arterial vascular access poses a clinical challenge in coronary interventional preclinical studies. a coronary stenting project required weekly arterial vascular access for 5 wk followed by monthly access for a maximum of 10 procedures via the carotid or femoral arteries. for safety reasons, each vessel was cannulated no more than 3 times. a commonly used diet-induced NASH model consists of C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat, high-fructose, high-cholesterol diet with a large proportion of a trans fat. with the FDA ban on trans fats, this diet is no longer available. at 16 wk on diet, C57BL/6NTac mice (n=10) showed much higher body weight, liver weight, cholesterol, LDL, and transaminases compared to control mice on chow diet. data support use of palm oil diet as an appropriate diet for induction of NAFLD/NASH in C57BL/6NTac mice. mice were irradiated at 100 cGy and divided into 2 experimental groups based on irradiation method. at 4 h postirradiation, CD34+ cells were thawed, suspended in PBS and injected intravenously into the tail vein. our goal was to determine if large animal species, such as swine and sheep, could be reliably used for auditory studies. we report successful procedures such as transtympanic injection (TT) and recording of acoustic auditory brainstem response (aABR) in large animal species. the aABR threshold is not affected by anesthesia protocol for all frequencies tested. for both species the aABR threshold is not affected by anesthesia protocol for all frequencies tested. our system is sensitive enough to be used with subcutaneous electrode alone. two groups received either the TMV-CSP+ALFQ or the CSP+ALFQ vaccines intramuscularly at months 0-1-2. both models reproduced a mild skin reaction after the vaccination with no elevations in renal and liver function tests. both models predicted the superiority of TMV vaccine over CSP barring minor differences in their ability to detect differences in avidity. we sprayed or topically treated the mice a total of 8 times, 4 times per week consecutively, over a 2-wk period. the animals being treated with 10% chlorhexidine solution [spray] had final scores of 0 and 1, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution. a 4-y-old female lab guinea pig was evaluated after having acute weight loss, polyuria/polydipsia, and diarrhea. twenty-seven E. coli isolates were obtained from 25 animals. small mammals are a reservoir for potentially pathogenic E. coli with zoonotic risk. the development of active tuberculosis is often the result of known risk factors, either intrinsic or extrinsic. initial results show reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improved cellular viability in all treatment groups. results suggest increased macrophage immune response through vitamin-A dependent pathways. s into uterine foster mothers (ICR) obtained 17 weaned pups. urinary protein concentration in Mup-KO mice was significantly lower. protein analysis confirmed that Mup-KO mice had no Mup proteins in urines. mice were randomly assigned (n=10/group) and 1x105 or 5x105 cells in PBS were injected subcutaneously in their right flanks. tumor growth happened at a more rapid pace in the young mice than in the aged mice for those given 1x105 cells. rhesus macaques were randomly selected for clinical screening of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. commercially available fructosamine and commercially available A1C tests showed a false negative. rhesus macaques ranges from 4% to 5.7% binding of A1C to hemoglobin. sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is the most common antibiotic detected in natural waters. sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is the most common antibiotic detected in natural waters. sulfamethoxazole is the most common antibiotic detected in natural waters. antibiotics contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance in aquatic animals and potentially their environment. the impact of fasting and bedding on blood glucose and regional brain uptake of 18F-FDG R Speedy* has been used for nearly 30 y for cardiovascular, cancer, and neurological disorders. a single stranded, non-enveloped DNA virus categorized as a member of a currently unclassified Parvovirus subfamily. muCPV is genetically and antigenically distinct from Protoparvoviruses (e.g. MVM, MPV) muCPV has recently been linked with the development of kidney disease in laboratory mice. antigen was further tested by screening heterologous sera positive for other infectious agents. results showed no cross-reactivity with non-MuCPV antibodies. prkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice were implanted in 5 mice using a 14g needle, 10 mice in the MFP with 18g needle, and 10 mice in the MFP with 14g needle for each tumor model. there was no statistical difference in latency, doubling time or engraftment rates between implantation methods in each of the tumor models tested. twenty adult female CD-1 mice were split into 2 groups. 1 group receiving daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg ketamine daily. 1 group receiving daily injections of an equivalent volume of saline. pigs (7 total animals) were euthanized and injected intramuscularly (IM) and subcutaneously (SC) with 2 mL of dye solution. IM injections were performed in the cervical and hind limb musculature using 3 needle lengths (0.75, 1 and 1.5 inch) in all breeds, SC injection site characteristics did not vary significantly between anatomic locations or needle lengths. a subtype of extracellular nano-sized vesicle has been shown to mediate extracellular communication via transport of various biomolecules. this process impacts several physiological and pathological processes. a novel isolation method of exosomal miRNA from mouse feces has grown significantly. the miRNA was purified via acid phenol-chloroform method. this procedure successfully created high-yield exosomal miRNA that can be applied to most species. the choline deficient defined amino acid diet (CDAA) induces NASH. histopathology performed on biopsy tissue confirmed advanced steatosis and minimal fibrosis after 15 wk of CDAA diet feeding. ALT (P 0.0003) and PIIINP (P 0.02) levels were significantly elevated compared to chow fed group. diet change resulted in lowering body weight within first week. heart failure often develops after prolonged period of hypertension due to excessive load to the left ventricle. this form of left ventricular pressure overload (LVPO) causes a form of heart failure with unique features and is defined as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) however, therapies to treat HfpEF have not been forthcoming due to a lack of animal models. PDX mice used in preclinical trials are commonly dosed intravenously (IV) or oral gavage (PO) mice were implanted subcutaneously in the flank with PDX material. mice were randomized by tumor volume (150mm3) into 5 groups. experimental infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in biosafety level (BSL) 2/3 environment is frequently used as a mouse model to study acute and chronic viral infections. a third IVC rack, with cages containing mice noninfected with LCMV, was used as negative control. LCMV was detected in EAD capture media (1 positive out of 2 samples) and plenums swabs (n=3) from all racks and feces (n=6) from LCMV-infected mice cages. LCMV copy number in all samples was very low (1-10 copies) indicating that the virus was shed at a low level. measurements taken at monthly intervals from age 10 wk (24kg) to 30 wk(80kg) will serve as a guide in matching swine anatomy and age with target tissue morphology. predetermined sites and surface area per location were assigned at study start. behavioral study requires prolonged cage changes due to disruption of the animal\u2019s circadian rhythm. prolonged cage changing raises concerns of increased ammonia levels which may affect the animal\u2019s health. a concentrated formulation of buprenorphine HCl labeled for use in cats with recommended dosing every 24 h is commercially available. males and females were injected with 1 of the 3 buprenorphine formulations at a dose of 1mg/kg subcutaneously at time 0. h for all groups and 24 h for the SIM and BupSR groups. high blood level concentrations were observed in both groups 1 h. both groups had similar pharmacokinetic curves including rates of decline. all major organs were harvested from 3 adult female CD-1 mice. they were divided into 4 portions, placed in an OCT filled cryomold, and frozen by 2-methylbutane, 1-methoxyheptafluoropropane, hexane, and 1 portion was frozen directly in cryotubes placed in liquid nitrogen. twenty female rabbits were divided into 5 groups: buprenorphine 0.06mg/kg IM q8h, buprenorphine+low-dose maropitant 5mg/kg SC q24h, 3) buprenorphine+high-dose maropitant 10mg/kg SC q24h, 4) high-dose maropitant, or 5) saline. the aim of the study was to measure blood velocity and vessel diameter in commonly accessed swine peripheral vessels. the swine were anesthetized and ultrasonography was used to visualize peripheral vessels. femoral artery ( = 645.03 mm/s, = 168.23 mm/s) had overlapping standard deviations with the systolic velocity in the human radial ( = 313.8 mm/s, = 72.2 mm/s) and ulnar ( = 545.5 mm/s, = 104.5 mm/s) arteries from previous studies. additional vessels have shown similarities and differences between swine and human data. a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced retinal leakage model was established in rabbits. VEGF-induced leakage was completely blocked by anti-VEGF (ranibizumab) and 2 steroids. these behaviors were absent in animals treated with appropriate doses of BUP-SR prior to isoflurane anesthesia. these behaviors were absent in animals treated with an equivalent dose of BUP-SR subsequent to isoflurane anesthesia. sperm suspension was treated with 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. suspension of fresh sperm obtained from B6D2F1/Crlj mice was used for in vitro fertilization (13 females) fresh sperm was incubated with or without H2 for 20 min. treatment of sperm with hydrogen peroxide induced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. H2 can reach and react with intrasperm ROS, including hydroxyl radical, possibly in mitochondria and improve low sperm motility. ICGN-Tns2nph detected a novel major modifier locus on chromosome 10. the combined effect of the C57BL/6J alleles of the 2 loci reduced the urinary albumin excretion caused by Tns2 dysfunction. the identification of these modifier genes is expected to help elucidate the mechanism underlying podocyte injury. microchips are less likely to cause irritation, fall out, or be misread. compared to other identification methods, such as ear tags, microchips are less likely to cause irritation. mice were euthanized for gross pathology, subcutaneous culture, and histology. pathological assessment did not reveal a significant difference in inflammation (P > 0.999) between groups, and all culture results were negative. dominance status may affect immunological parameters of SIV infection. we hypothesize that dominance status would remain unchanged from preinoculation through acute infection and suppression. dominance hierarchy is unlikely to affect data produced by the model. rats are anesthetized to effect with isoflurane and placed in a ventral recumbency. a 27 g Lasse needle and a 100 L gas tight syringe are filled with the test material. a 100% success rate was determined for designated recovery animals with no lasting complications. preclinical imaging requires specific skills, knowledge, and equipment. it is important to have technicians who are proficient and accomplished at obtaining and maintaining venous access for anesthetized animals. specialized techniques help ensure clean delivery of agents. current training and restraint protocols for rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) typically involve generic solutions to behavioral challenges. this 1-size-fits-all approach, while largely effective, still leaves room for improvement. a scalp retractor is easily positioned and atraumatically retracts the scalp with substantial exposure of the skull. this improved retractor aligns with the 3Rs by minimizing tissue trauma while providing excellent exposure of the surgical site. a conscious nonhuman primate model allowing evaluations of pharmaceutical compound levels in brain fluids can have tremendous impact in disease areas such as Parkinson\u2019s. the interstitial fluid (ISF) compared to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can provide a better understanding of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of compounds in the brain. over the past 4 y we developed a combined microdialysis and CMP rhesus macaque model by way of 2 different surgical preparations. the electronic training record website satisfied IACUC, AAALAC, OLAW, and environment, health and safety requirement of employee training records in a central location. the goal was to create a program that would generate training requirements per job title, send automated notifications of new and revised standard operating procedures (SOP) cannulock buttons and medical-grade polyurethane catheters extended catheter patency for long term studies. the cannulock button provided a closed system that can be easily attached to any catheter and maintained a solid reliable connection because of the barbed stainless steel connector. mice were weaned at 21 d old into randomly assigned cages, either standard cages or cages with a partial cage divider. animals were tested on rotarod for balance and motor coordination, open field and elevated plus maze for anxiety-related behavior. id arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis are characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and swelling due to damage of the joint. intraarticular delivery is a route used to deliver potential new therapies for inflammatory joint conditions. this includes synovial fluid replacement, stem cells, and viral vectors. macaques are an essential animal model in HIV cure research. they are expected to reliably model changes to the immune system. stress has been shown to alter serotonin and dopamine metabolism. ptophan\u2019s alternate metabolite, kynurenine, is being shunted away from serotonin and melatonin production in socially housed animals. this decrease in the proinflammatory metabolite is consistent with the blunted immune response to SIV that we previously observed in singly housed animals. rabbits are easy and safe to handle by PIs and animal care staff. less stress has reduced premedication drug volumes and shorter anesthesia recovery time. a comprehensive and standardized training program must include a holistic approach to engagement, assessment, and opportunity. we propose a novel system that reframes the job description and employer expectations into a ranked list of skills. the training curriculum is then based on a standardized definition of skill-based training. we have optimized a refined cisterna magna puncture technique for CSF collection in the Theiler\u2019s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD) model. this sampling technique allows serial CSF samples to be obtained from the same mouse at 2-mo intervals. a university animal resources program (ARP) and institutional animal care and use committee established an inhouse rodent registry. it allows investigators to search a secure web page for specific rodent lines before looking to outside sources for their research needs. this registry does not account for every line on campus, but has been a powerful tool used by the investigator(s) looking for a model that may benefit their research. mice are born, raised, and studied in isolators in the absence of any known microbes. the use of antibiotics to decrease the microbial flora does not require special equipment. the use of antibiotics to decrease the microbial flora does not require special equipment. ampicillin resulted in improved palatability, improved elimination of the gut flora, and reduction in the gut flora at a more rapid rate. the most recent version of the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia recommend methods of euthanasia for laboratory rodents. 5% isoflurane was significantly decreased in the hamsters euthanized with pentobarbital. all three methods of euthanasia are appropriate options for the euthanasia of hamsters. there may be welfare concerns associated with the use of isoflurane. tocia in the original breeding colony, was used to perform a cost analysis and to determine the potential costs to the researcher of breeding a mouse with a LVS. the addition of the training tool has led to an increased comfort level in checking for this abnormality. this saves the researcher costs associated with per diem rates and the loss of productive research time while simultaneously improving animal welfare. labs must still train their personnel to perform the labs\u2019 specific procedures. this creates a culture of tribal knowledge transfer, where surgery practices often do not adhere to standards known to produce the best outcomes. we piloted a program to certify individuals within labs as surgeons. dental disease is recognized as a normal part of the aging process for dogs. a colony of beagles housed long-term on an IACUC-approved protocol, were noted to have developed dental disease. the clinical veterinarian presented the CE in two components. behavioural, physiological, and biological parameters are often used to evaluate the benefit of a new enrichment but little information is available on how different enrichment strategies might impact group pattern of activity. increased home cage activity has been correlated with increased aggression in males and animal handling procedures such as cage change. Xenopus laevis is a popular model for developmental biology and disease research. ample published data are available describing effective euthanasia methods. however, evidence-based euthanasia recommendations have not been published for adult X. laevis tadpoles. a subset of 10 tadpoles from each group had no detectable heartbeats after 4 h in recovery solution at all time points tested. eugenol at 600uL/L was variably effective at producing irreversible euthanasia; therefore, we deem eugenol at this concentration unacceptable for euthanasia. the animal model will allow preclinical testing of agents that induce immunemodulatory effects in the lower respiratory tract. this can lead to induction of systemic adaptive immunity and can be applied to other therapeutic groups. adult male pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) are commonly single housed when unable to locate a compatible partner. we introduced 3 different adult males to 3 separate juvenile groups. anesthetizing isoflurane on a cotton ball in a conical tube placed around Gg domesticus\u2019 beak until anesthetized. the cotton ball holds the isoflurane in its liquid state so that spilling would not occur. this method was successful for younger Leghorns. rabbits were anesthetized using a laryngoscope, size 3.0 cuffed endotracheal tube and an 8-French polypropylene urinary catheter as a guide stylet. the ET tube rested to the left of the upper incisors and was allowed to exit over the central bar of the U-frame on the left. rabbits were anesthetized for 3-4 h. no anesthetic deaths or serious complications in any of the 12 rabbits. animals were visually monitored, provided treats, juice, light projections, and chewing toys throughout dose duration. the snuggle board restraints were used for 13 wk, until the animals were over 1 y of age and large enough for the procedure cage. the hammocks have proven to be durable, easily sanitized, and easy to place and remove. QA specialists work to facilitate compliance and minimize barriers to the conduct of sound, robust research without compromising animal welfare. the inclusion of pain suppressive agents in experimental procedures requires detailed research involving various analgesic or anesthetic options. a total of 48 Wistar-Han rats, 8-12 wk old, were randomly divided into 6 groups. each rat to evaluate self-grooming at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 26 h after analgesic treatments. the data was analyzed using a 95% confidence interval considering a P less than 0.05 as statistically significant. the DT group had a lower grooming transfer test score at all times evaluated, showing significant differences compared with other groups. the degree of prolapse depends on the amount and condition of the exposed rectal tissue and the general condition of the animal. it is possible to detect small exudate spots (or blood in advanced stages) thus allowing to decrease animal manipulation and restraint to verify the state of the prolapse. animals in groups 3, 4, and 5 (sham dosing) were given 1-2 mL of drinking water over 2 wk. sham dosing on a Monday\u2013Friday schedule over 2 wk is sufficient to acclimate mice to the oral gavage procedure. u.s. team members with operational responsibilities in china began pursuing Chinese language classes to demonstrate our commitment to these relationships. the dedicated operational teams continue to work side-by-side with various Chinese organizations to provide resources. filter papers placed directly on the inside floor of an empty mouse cage were compared to the traditional use and testing of sentinel mice. each experimental group contained 7 replicate cages. both types of filter paper reliably detected each of the infectious agents shed by the study mice and were as effective as the use of live sentinel mice. pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala) are a species of bird not often used in research. the pigeon will often become stressed and flap around the cage causing feather loss and injury to itself. a behavior plan was designed to involve increased enrichment, housing space, and human interaction. the tool can be used by other institutions attempting to rehabilitate undomesticated species for transfer to an avian facility. sulfoxaflor residues in pig tissues were significantly correlated with those in rats. sulfoxaflor residues in rats and pigs were significantly correlated. sulfoxaflor residues in rats and pigs were significantly correlated. sulfoxaflor residue experiments to set MRL could be performed using laboratory small animals. lab animal science community is constantly looking for alternatives to animal usage whenever possible. we have developed training tools using 3D modeling that reduce the number of mice used but meet the standards for a strong training program. we hope to implement these newer models in the next few months. 87 per cent of respondents said they would name research animals. 76% disagreed with the statement \"I provide better care to named animals\" naming can have emotional consequences. two female cynomolgus macaques had a chronic catheter and catheter protection system. the monkeys groomed each other and engaged in other prosocial behaviors. there were no adverse clinical effects that resulted from the social housing. the retirement of nonhuman primates is often a complex decision. the retirement of nonhuman primates comes with a unique set of hurdles that may need approval at many levels of the institution. pigs quickly develop an aversion to the repeat blood sample collections that can be stressful to the animals and staff. the use of modified vascular access buttons may be a refinement for miniature pig blood collection for pharmacological and toxicological research. the use of modified vascular access buttons may be a refinement for miniature pig blood collection for pharmacological and toxicological research. premature lambs (118-121 d) are delivered and placed on an artificial placenta machine. some species, like humans, are born with passive immunity to pathogens. other species, like newborn lambs (Ovis aries), are not born with protective levels of maternal Ig. a single intravenous plasma transfusion was capable of raising serum IgG levels in the premature lamb. however, these levels were not elevated to the threshold of being considered protective. a quality assurance (QA) hideaway program was developed to help in the evaluation of employee performance and adherence to established policies and procedures. QA hideaway program is a fun and effective way to monitor technician performance and training needs. goal is to increase reporting results so that >90% of hideaways are reported within 24 h. we use a team approach to address welfare needs of animals. members of clinical, behavioral, and husbandry staff meet regularly to discuss issues surrounding individual animals. this increased communication has greatly improved animal care. individually ventilated caging (IVC) is used in many animal facilities. standard husbandry practices in this type of equipment are a 14-d cage change schedule and airflow rates of 60 air changes per hour. novel cage design had previously been tested in a 5-mouse setting. novel cage design saw an advantage over the traditional design in how many pups make weaning age. the novel cage also saw significantly lower pup loss (9%) than the traditional design (27%). both cage types saw increased ammonia over time, which is remarkable given the cage change schedule. half of the rabbits were masked down with isoflurane only, once they were anesthetized, blood was collected immediately after induction. additional rabbits were premedicated before being masked for a procedure, and blood was collected using the same method. neurosurgery residents and fellows dissect the rat femoral vessels to learn anastomotic techniques. the optimum utilization of our rats is via bilateral vessels on the same animal, cutting our rat numbers down by half. the optimum utilization of our rats is via bilateral vessels on the same animal. phantom training tools were created using hot glue tumors and commercially available indoor hunting cat food feeder mice. the tool was used to train technicians prior to in vivo acquisition of calipered tumor measures and demonstrated application of the 3Rs. 2Animal Sciences and Technologies, Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom. 4Animal Sciences and Technologies, Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, R&D, AstraZeneca, gothenburg, Sweden. AST are our expert group leading a global approach to the use of animals in research, including the promotion of initiatives around openness and transparency. a global approach to the responsible use of animals in research is an important step to earning the public\u2019s trust. a global approach to the responsible use of animals in research is an important step to earning the public\u2019s trust. blood collection took place on Wednesdays whereas sling acclimation took place on Fridays for 6 consecutive wk. results showed that DAP successfully reduces heart rates and respiratory rates during sling acclimation and helped to reduce behaviors associated with stress. retrospective assessment of Rabbit housing from individual Cages to floor pens MM Ricca*1, S Valenzuela2 1Animal Facility, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. staff assessed previously reported animal welfare improvements and technical staff perceptions. venipuncture sites may yield differences in clinical pathology values. the site of venipuncture should differ from site of intravenous (IV) drug administration due to potential extravasation. anesthetized penile vein dosing provides a refinement for IV dosing leaving the lateral tail and saphenous veins available for serial blood collection. the vein is superficial and can be visualized under the skin, enabling more confidence in accuracy of IV dosing. CF ATP bioluminescence remained at or below 10 RLU for 28 d after opening the box. RODAC plates had no growth for 70% of CF boxes at day 0, 100% at day 14, and 90% at day 28. our department has developed a training program for common rodent blood collection and dosing techniques. common techniques include intraperitoneal injections, subcutaneousinjections, submandibular blood collection, and cardiac puncture blood collection. vet techs are trained by the training team, which consists of the vet tech supervisors and the training manager. use of carbon dioxide (CO2) or cervical dislocation are the main methods employed for euthanasia of mice. wrongdoing or misuse is likely to cause immediate stress and pain for mice. research integrity specialist combines training from both the IACUC and IBC offices to ensure that reviews of both protocols were consistent with one another. this process alleviates the need for the IACUC administrator to blindly hand off the IBC review to another reviewer who may not know the requirements for the review. the heifers were socialized by personnel up to 5 d per week for a minimum of 30 min per session. the program has successfully acclimatized 3 of the 4 cohorts of heifers to personnel, wearing halters, and standing calmly in a stanchion. flash glucose monitoring system is available as an alternative to blood collection for diabetic human patients. patch measures interstitial glucose continuously for up to 14 d. blood collection in this species is impractical without anesthesia. research in animals was included in the syllabus when theories from the positivism and Darwinism became relevant at the end of the century. in the early 19th century, medical training did not include research with animals in Mexico. in the early 19th century, medical training did not include research with animals in Mexico. risk-benefit analysis is a well-established method in animal research where the word \u201crisk\u201d provides for a prospective mitigation of potential adverse effects. harm-benefit analysis was recently introduced in the european Union using the word \u201charm\u201d as a replacement word for \u201crisk\u201d in the benefit analysis animal protocol review process. CIRS-LAS.de is the world\u2019s first published web based critical incident database for laboratory animal science. more than 90 people from Europe are already registered users of the portal and more than 55 critical incidents have already been entered. CIRS-LAS.de is the world\u2019s first published web based critical incident database for laboratory animal science. the 3R principles will enhance animal welfare worldwide. the time to rethink has been achieved: to learn from negative results. the animal program provides a 2-part training workshop. Xenopus laevis is a commonly used laboratory frog species for which knowledge of optimal husbandry is limited. in the wild, Xenopus are found in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, limiting movement to feeding or evading predators. Xenopus remained at rest over 69% for the time reviewed at all housing densities. on average, Xenopus remained at rest over 69% for the time reviewed at all housing densities, the majority occurred on the enclosure floor. IQ Consortium member companies convened to develop an informed and objective response, focusing on areas of agreement, potential gaps or missing information. the authors agree that many positions in the opinion generally align with industry views on the use of NHPs in research and testing. orientation training was converted to an online course using learning management software provided by the institution in an effort to alleviate some of these issues. the benefits of online training include the ability to incorporate knowledge check questions to confirm that key points are retained. most commercial systems for heating animals within tomographic (3D) imaging systems use circulating warm air or warm liquid, both of which require free space around the animal. small resistive heater elements are effective; images are not distorted through their use. postapproval monitoring program under the Attending Veterinarian S Patton*, P Charlton Division of Laboratory Animal Services, Augusta University, Augusta, GA. the department of laboratory animal services has had to make many changes to keep pace. the new program is aimed at promoting alignment between laboratory practices and approved animal use protocols. a flooded cage is promptly reported to the veterinary staff and placed into a clean bedded cage. Depending upon supplies available in any given animal facility, heat lamps, heat discs, or warm-water recirculating blankets have been used to provide thermal support. a commercial terrarium heat mat and a 75-watt heat lamp clipped beside the cage were able to raise the bedded cage temperature 9\u00b0C within 10 min, to 30\u00b0C. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were implanted with 2 identical microchips each. each method of collection was compared to a rectal temperature to determine reliability and accuracy. the intraperitoneal implanted microchip gave reliable data. researchers spend significant amount of time designing experiments, performing in vitro bench work, writing papers, and completing grant submissions. the concept of a Pre-Clinical Rodent Services (PCS) was initiated based on researcher requests for training on these techniques which may take considerable time to master. the service was generated from basic techniques that researchers needed for drug discovery activities and management of breeding services. a conscious jugular \u2018micro-sample\u2019 collection technique (50l) for rats and a \u2018low volume\u2019 cephalic/saphenous collection technique (600l) for large animals (beagle/cyno) were developed, and found to have a direct benefit for serial collection of toxicokinetic (TK) samples. the decreased volume collection approach has also been applied to alternate sample types, including antidrug antibody (ADA) and metabolite identification (MetID) the IACUC committee is a vital part of animal research and ensures the safety of the animals. it is important that members of the committee have proper training in order to review protocols and make decisions to the best of their abilities. animal user training programs are essential components of research organizations ensuring appropriate training of personnel and satisfaction of mandatory regulatory requirements. evaluation of these programs is critical to confirming effectiveness of personnel to uphold high standards of ethical and humane research with animals. the use of transcutaneous buttons kept the catheters patent longer than the standard externalized catheters. this data suggests that bidirectional catheter patency for blood collection is relatively shortterm in comparison to catheter patency. mission for Ethical Animal Experiments Education Program at Seoul National University Hospital Y Won*, J Parl, B Kang Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea In the past 20 years, we have been operating several education programs for the staff and investigators in animal research facility based on the 3Rs principle. the development of IACUCs is an important step to national policy on care and use of experimental animals. the absence of national legislation regarding experimental animals negatively impacts both the credibility of Georgian scientific products, regardless of their scientific value. Georgian association for laboratory animal science (GALAS) aims to contribute to biomedical research by step-by-step implementation of laboratory animal care and use policy in Georgia. since 2016 the GALAS aims to contribute to biomedical research by step-by-step implementation of laboratory animal care and use policy in Georgia. the clinical scoring system was developed to meet AALAS and IACUC standards to minimize pain and distress in animals. a score of 0 reflects an animal showing no clinical signs while a score of 5 signifies an animal in a moribund condition. the system provides staff with veterinary care guidelines, which can help prevent compassion fatigue. the normal VHS range for aotus monkeys is 9.0\u201310.7. a colony of Cope\u2019s gray treefrogs presented in October 2018 for severe attrition of unknown etiology. over 100 frogs were moved to a new location in April. the affected frogs were found dead with no previous clinical signs. the colony collapse was attributed to chytridiomycosis, with emaciation and endoparasitism. a 2.5-mo-old, 20.9 g male C57Bl/6-TgN(gpt Delta) was used in a chronic ethanol treatment study (9 d on a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol) he presented with a hunched posture and a greater than 20% loss of body weight. 4 animals in the treatment group were found dead 2 d later. endemic Pneumocystis infection with associated morbidity and mortality in this colony of immunocompetent mice. the colony has been rederived through embryo transfer and additional preventative measures. reference intervals were established in the rhesus macaque without any identifiable cardiomyopathies. the VHS measured on the RL views, but not VD and DV views, was significantly higher in the cardiomyopathy group compared to the control group. only the nonHCM group had significantly higher VHS values when compared to controls. young NSG/NRG mice (n=49, mean age = 4 mo, +/- SEM 0.36) exhibited nonspecific clinical signs of moderate-severe lethargy, hunched posture, decreased body condition, and pallor. feces and environmental samples were collected for culture and PCR analysis. the current literature contains sparse reports of B. gladioli infections in immunocompromised mice. a potential differential for subcutaneous abscesses, hepatitis, and splenomegaly in immunocompromised mice. the rabbit re-presented for marked hematuria with several blood clots present in the pan. postmortem examination revealed multiple, dark red-brown, well-demarcated, small multinodular masses associated with the uterine horns. the clinical signs observed in this case likely stem from an overlap of the conditions of endometrial venous aneurysm. the ova were about 70 um x 43 um bipolar ovoid shapes embedded in the nasal epithilium. the parasite is likely of the genus Eucoleus, which is characterized by doubly operculated ova with pitted surfaces. reproducibility of fetal surgical protocols can prove challenging. multiple fetal and maternal factors complicate a straightforward protocol, such as unique nutritional and metabolic demands, appropriate selection of anesthesia and analgesia. a small number of dogs are infected with B. pahangi, and serve as a host for the adult worm to produce microfilaria. 1 dog developed clinical signs suggestive of peripheral lymphatic blockage, and was subsequently treated for lymphatic filariasis. a followup project was developed to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal treatment approach to clear the infection. limb edema had visibly resolved and the microfilarial count was negative for the 8 mo following treatment. a necropsy was performed at the time of euthanasia. no gross pathology or signs of adult worms were noted. neoplasm exhibited biphasic cytology (polygonal/fusiform-type), neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), mixed glioma, and meningioma. cynomolgus macaques is rare, especially in juveniles. 10 adult female frogs were randomly assigned to each group. group 1, 2, and 3 were immersed in freshly made buffered tricaine. after 1-h immersion, no frogs in any group displayed signs of spontaneous activity. a propofol overdose at 40 mg/L with a 10-min submersion euthanizes zebrafish as effectively as a 20- or 30-min immersion. thirty adult wild-type AB zebrafish were randomly divided into 3 groups of 10 fish each. all fish within each group were simultaneously immersed into 40 mg/L propofol for 10, 20, or 30 min then monitored for recovery. three adult, female, Xenopus laevis were reported for \"red legs\" 3 d after a system malfunction altered the housing tank temperatures. two frogs presented with acute hyperemia, skin sloughing, bloating, and lethargy. the third frog presented with minor hyperemia of the right hind interdigital webbing. fenbendazole and metronidazole for the treatment of mice naturally infected with S. muris were used per group. mice were euthanized with fenbendazole 50 mg/kg via sucralose-flavored medication delivery gel and untreated sucralose-flavored medication delivery gel as a control. no treatment of fenbendazole, metronidazole or a combination of therapeutics were effective in the treatment of S. muris. further studies are needed to see if higher doses are effective. bullet-tip catheters showed repeated instances of partial patency and had the first instance of nonpatency. rounded-tip design is superior to bullet-tip design in maintaining catheter patency. mouse kidney parvovirus (MKPV) was the cause of this inclusion body-associated nephropathy. es were lined by swollen, vacuolated tubular epithelial cells with pale-eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, and karyomegalic nuclei. these changes were consistent with a moderate to severe chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy associated with the presence of atypical, intranuclear inclusion bodies within the renal tubular epithelium in a manner similar to those observed in association with MKP the rate of cesarean section was 6.7% for all births during the study period (6/89) cesarean section resulted in at least 1 live-born infant in 71.4% of cases (5/7), of which the majority of infants were fostered to a lactating surrogate female. mirtazapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, is used in dogs and cats. it has anecdotally been used as an appetite stimulant in guinea pigs. but a therapeutic dose of mirtazapine has not been established for this species. mice had multifocal small, firm, raised, superficial masses on their tails. none of the masses expelled discharge and no treatment was prescribed. mice were monitored for clinical progression of the masses. a diagnosis of pyogranulomatous inflammation secondary to Staphylococcus xylosus infection was made. abnormalities of the Ncf1 gene leads to dysfunction of the NADPH oxidase protein in neutrophils. aseptic practices and special husbandry care should be implemented to prevent inadvertent infections. approximately 4.2% of mouse fecal samples, 5.1% of environmental samples, and 5.4% of transplantable tumors have tested positive to date. commercial rodent colonies comprise 78 health reporting groups which include open wire-top static cage or individually ventilated cage (IVC) barrier facilities. the specific pathogens in our test panel were selected from relatively recent publications as causing morbidity and/or mortality in Xenopus laevis and/or X. tropicalis. many of the pathogens in our panel are zoonotic diseases placing frog aquarists at risk for acquiring infections. the authors hope to share techniques that can be help increase successful intubation in the rabbit. the ability to repeatedly intubate rabbits, confirm tube placement in the trachea, and maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia with uneventful anesthesia recovery. the ability to understand the anatomy of the rabbit airway system combined with the use of practice animals for training successfully led to safe and effective rabbit anesthesia outcomes. the animal was observed 3 times a day for 1 wk and activity level increased each day. the surgical site healed successfully, the animal\u2019s appetite was good. the animal was taken to scheduled necropsy 13 wk later. humane endpoint criteria for humanization have not been clearly outlined in the veterinary science and humanized mouse literature. to address this issue, we developed a cageside scoring system specifically for NCG mice following the process of humanization with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. this scoring system included criteria surrounding overall appearance, physical exam parameters, behavioral scoring, and body condition scoring. the presence of ketonemia or ketonuria often indicates that the individual has an uncontrolled comorbidity or requires further diagnostic or therapeutic care. newer handheld ketone meters specifically measure BHBA and can help to identify animals in the earliest stages of ketogenesis. hydrated, had significant porphyrin staining around the eyes and nose, was hunched in posture, and tender on abdominal palpation. a foreign body (hair shaft) was found as the core of 1 liver lesion. culture of the serosanguinous abdominal fluid revealed Proteus mirabilis, which is described as a ubiquitous bacterium in the environment. Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups postsurgery based on the drug delivery system provided: acetaminophen in water (AW), acetaminophen in gel (AG), and acetaminophen in water and gel (AWG) there was no significant difference among the groups for the average daily acetaminophen dose ingested. outer retinal atrophy was observed during histopathological analysis of a 7-d rat safety study. this finding occurred at all dose levels, including control, indicating that the lesion was not test-article related. the male Wistar Han rats originated at a vendor where each undergone surgery. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40, male, 12-wk-old) were placed on 60% high fat diet (HFD) for 4 wk to induce a state of obesity prior to RYGB (n=35) or sham (n=5) surgical intervention. 85% of the RYGB animals (n=6 of 7) exhibited acute respiratory issues including coughing, open mouthed breathing, and wet/raspy breathing sounds. the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a valuable animal model for multiple areas of biomedical research, including neuroscience and immunology. the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a valuable animal model for multiple areas of biomedical research. the sample group was limited to healthy marmosets with blood drawn preoperatively for elective procedures. reference ranges were generated and evaluated by sex (16 males, 33 females) and age, with 22 juvenile to adult (less than 5 years) and 27 older adult to aged (5 years and older) marmosets included in the study. the right kidney was effaced by a pale-grey, multilobulated, firm to cystic mass occupying the right retroperitoneal space. the right renal parenchyma was replaced by a poorly demarcated, nonencapsulated, multilobulated, expansile mass composed of 3 neoplastic populations: epithelial, mesenchymal, and anaplastic blastemal-like cells. the extrarenal masses were predominantly composed of neoplastic epithelial cells. neoplastic epithelial cells were positive for pancytokeratin and mesenchymal and blastemal-like cells were positive for vimentin. nephroblastoma with peritoneal metastasis is highly unusual. rats took the longest time to approach and consume the yogurt treats at 3 and 6 h postoperatively. orbital tightening was the only behavior that was significantly different at 3 and 6 h postoperatively. the use of yogurt treat consumption as an indicator of pain is inadequate. data is still being evaluated to determine which commercial product is most effective. the results of this project will aid in assessing possible methods to prevent, but also treat hoof concerns in swine, for production and research settings. fulminant disease manifested an average of 13 and 3 d after the observation of each sign. kyphotic posture and \u201cstaring\u201d were identified as a late-stage signs. using this system, we can accurately predict the rapidity of clinical decline and the necessity for proactive intervention. our foundation colony is maintained in a gnotobiotic isolator. it ensures that all microbial organisms present are known. agents that are not specified on this exclusion list are not tested for or identified. commercially available mouse anesthesia nosecones use active scavenging. these devices typically use a tube within a tube (coaxial) design. the outer tube is connected to vacuum to scavenge any anesthetic gases that may escape around the nosecone-rodent interface. 27 mice were submitted for complete necropsy, histopathology, and bacterial cultures and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. 2 mice had neutrophilic enterotyphlocolitis and 5 had heavy burden of Tritrichomonas spp in the ceca and proximal colons. a 13-yold female rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) presented with dystocia and hindlimb paralysis that was suspected to be due to sciatic nerve impingement. a cesarean section was performed and the animal remained in cage housing for approximately 3 wk until adequate mobility was obtained. the animal was noted with caudal abdominal organomegaly, suspected to be a subsequent pregnancy. equina degeneration, necrotizing serositis of the cervix/vagina, and a mild cystitis have been noted in cattle following dystocia. prolonged labor has been identified as a risk factor for urinary retention in humans, and sciatic nerve degeneration has been noted in nonhuman primate cases. neoplasms in captive Xenopus spp are uncommonly described in the literature. this case highlights a common neoplasm in an uncommon location. an anomaly was noted that appeared to be a possible bicornuate uterus. the female offspring was found to be normal anatomically at necropsy. the female offspring were found to be normal anatomically at necropsy. previous treatment include omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin E supplementation, with no improvement. topical treatment of essential oils was implemented for 5 mo with minimal improvement in pruritus and no new hair regrowth. a CBC and serum chemistry was performed and revealed mild eosinophilia, neutrophilia, and a monocytosis. this animal is being used as a training animal for PI familiarization and non-invasive procedures. 3 antiseptic preparation agents were all equally effective at reducing bacterial populations at the immediate and 20-min postpreparation timepoints. results from this study indicated that all 3 products are comparable to povidone-iodine and alcohol preparations as agents in the aseptic preparation of surgical sites. body weight peaks at 16-18 mo-old (M) in B6N mice (approximately male 44.4g, female 33.8g) and only male mice showed rapid decrease at around 22 mo. also body weight peaks differed by sex (male 14M, female 22M) crossfostering has been used to eradicate Helicobacter spp, murine norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, and mouse encephalomyelitis virus. the colony has been astrovirus free for over a 1 based on PCR-based assessment. the colony has been astrovirus free for over a 1 based on PCR-based assessment. weekly MRIs were impractical and the abscesses were located beneath the craniotomy chamber. weekly neurosonography showed a decrease in abscess diameter and dissolution of the surrounding abscess capsule. the ultrasound sessions were augmented with MRI that confirmed resolution of the lesions and associated encephalitis and meningitis. a preliminary assessment of rats (n=169) housed on solid bottom cages with alpha cellulose bedding for 6 mo showed 44% of single (n=80) and 36% (n=89) of pair-housed rats developed hind foot lesions. lesions were more severe in single-housed rats. mice from a single vendor presented with low body condition scores, hunched posture, pallor, lethargy, increased respiratory rate and effort. all mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages with autoclaved aspen chip bedding, irradiated feed and acidified RO water. physiologic changes occur during pregnancy, many of which lead to changes in serum biochemical parameters. these are well documented in humans and reported in several species of nonhuman primates, including Rhesus macaques. study iterations involving a rat model for creating abdominal adhesions via laparotomy procedure found 25% of rats self-removed their incisional metal clips postoperatively. this necessitated repeat anesthesia and replacement of the clips, and introduced the potential for complications such as pain, infection, or evisceration. no differences in postsurgical appearance, behavior, or posteuthanasia incision area histopathology were observed between the two groups. the method of suture closure was deemed preferable to metallic clips by laboratory staff. mice with tail lesions had ischemic necrosis caused by vascular thrombosis. three tumor seeds transplanted into affected mice tested positive for reovirus by PCR. the animal evinced pale mucous membranes, a CRT over 4 sec, hypothermia, and dehydration. initial in-house clinical pathology confirmed severe dehydration as evidenced by hyperproteinemia and elevated PCV. a full biochemistry panel at a reference lab verified in-house results. this is the first successfully managed case of MH in a macaque. genetic testing may yield useful data to exclude animals with MH mutations from studies requiring inhalant anesthetics. the syndrome occurred predominantly in younger animals; 15/21 were 2-3 y of age at time of necropsy. no infectious etiology was identified based on bacterial culture, histopathology, and electron microscopy of gall bladder and duodenum. distended gall bladder and cystic ducts along with variable dilatation of the proximal duodenum and stomach were also observed. an ophthalmic exam localized the lesion to the anterior chamber using direct ophthalmoscopy and slit lamp biomicroscopy. there was no evidence of discharge, squinting, pain, or fluorescein stain uptake. no abnormalities were visible on lateral, dorsoventral, or ventrodorsal radiography of the skull. lab staff detected the common snake mite on paper liners and on animals approximately 2 wk after they were housed into the vivarium. the vendor was contacted and reported a pyrethrin soak as treatment prior to shipment, which had failed. with the help of the facility manger, research laboratory, veterinary, and husbandry staff all snakes were successfully treated and the mites were eradicated. tattoos have been widely used for decades as a reliable and clear method for rodent identification. however, this method can result in skin inflammation and primary or secondary skin infections. the animal was prescribed ivermectin and cephalexin as presumptive treatment for ectoparasites or bacterial infection. initial diagnostics included superficial skin scrape, cytology, bacterial and fungal cultures, and bloodwork. the animal was sedated for collection of skin biopsies and blood for scabies ELISA. breeding and colony management assistant: a tool Designed to maintain minimally inbred complex microbiota rodent colonies A Sharma*, AL O\u2019Neill, A Dewitt, M McDowell, J Waterman, CL Franklin Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO Understanding the causal relationship between the composition of the resident GM is a rapidly emerging challenge for biomedical researchers. the BCMA was developed keeping in mind the needs of technicians, animal research staff and principal investigators. it is highly flexible and suitable for diverse management needs including: a) maintenance of minimally inbred mouse colonies, b) minimization of animal numbers while meeting specific age and sex requirements for lab experiments and services. mice were housed in breeding groups ranging from a 1:1 male:female breeding pair in a single cage, up to 2:8 male:female breeding groups in conjoined cages. efficiency metrics include litters per breeding group or female over time, litter survival, weaning rate, pups weaned by number of females per cage. housing the rats in larger cages prevented the dust-caps being knocked off. all animal studies were ethically reviewed and carried out in accordance with the corporate policy on the care, welfare, and treatment of animals. microbiome DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon library preparation and sequencing were performed. no statistical differences were realized in microbiome richness of feces (n=8 mice/group) or cecum (n=4 mice/group) contents based on one-way ANOVA. a change in bedding substrate will not greatly impact mouse gastrointestinal microbiome and downstream phenotypes influenced by the microbiome. despite basic biosecurity measures, we still have to work on programs that minimize the risk of entry of these parasites. labs can store/use their excess bone wax for up to 37 wk when either of the 2 methods are used. our department focused on mice in ventilated caging. to determine how much feed was actually being consumed, we used groups of mice to measure the amount of feed needed per cage. fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) wall panels are used to create inexpensive walls that can be handled easily by 1 person. the walls are trimmed to optimal height with the remaining pieces used as wall extensions, animal dividers, or platforms for feeding and watering. water dispensing guns were used to fill water bottles and dispense water for rodent medicine treatments. WG were stored in clean cage wash, treatment rooms, and animal rooms. unique numbered sanitation cards were placed on each WG. feeding E diet or E+G diet produced 140% more eggs than G diet, 75% more eggs than the S diet and 39% more total eggs than S+G diet. the results show that the best feeding strategy for optimal growth and spawning would be the (E) or (E+G) increased concentrations of ammonia in ventilated mouse cages contribute to adverse health consequences. we hypothesized that the CPB has a significantly higher absorption capacity than corn cob and is able to modify ammonia production within the cage. ize ammonia concentration across the bedding types was measured at 2, 4 and 17 h. corn cob cages also had an increased rate of ammonia production over the first 2 hours. this rate of ammonia production correlated with the ammonia levels measured prior to cage change. smart cage software allows for cages to be changed only when required. software also plans out cage changes and provides an easy way to collect census and quickly identify animals. smart cages supports the refinement principle of the 3Rs. flexible film isolators can house up to 1,200 mice in our 284-sq-ft housing room. when made to our standards, flexible film isolators take 3 wk to prepare and validate. individually ventilated cages take only 48 h. the chemical manufacturer and supplier recommend daily mixing of quat dilutions which is cost- and time-prohibitive. a study was undertaken to determine if bottles could be refilled less frequently than every day. euthanasia cards averaged 439 per week while food bags averaged 104 per week. the green committee was able to combine these and recycle an average of 277kg of paper products instead of having them enter landfills each year. ninety-five percent of staff surveyed either felt fulfilled or that they were making a difference. 68% (24/35) of rabbits that damaged the e-collar did so within 9 d of placement. this included full removal with signs of self-mutilation of the surgical site or animals with their feet or mouth stuck in the placed e-collar. a study was conducted to evaluate the use of destructible enrichment as a potential deterrent to chewing the e-collar. incoming laboratory rodents first go into a quarantine area. they are provided with aspen chip bedding in static filter top caging, ad libitum irradiated fenbendazole feed, antiparasiticide on cotton balls, and given reverse osmosis (RO) water. the committee is made up of animal husbandry staff, supervisors, health and safety employees, as well as an occupational health doctor. the committee is still relatively new, but has made great strides in improving the work flow and creating innovative, simple solutions to some of our biggest problems. our veterinary team customized a web-based data capture system for rodent health cases. the system was designed with a modular point-and-click interface and supported with detailed online tutorials. the user enters a case number which prompts a custom-made questionnaire. paper-based bedding decreased intracage ammonia levels compared to corn cob bedding for mice housed in individually ventilated mouse cages. paper-based bedding in static cages does not alter intracage ammonia levels in the same manner as individually ventilated mouse cages. the rabbits were maintained on an alfalfa hay-based diet for their entire lifespan. the rabbits were assessed at least semiannually with a blood and urine sample collection. the decision to euthanize was made due to complications associated with cardiovascular disease, Pastuerella, or neoplasia. group 2, 3, and 4 received standard enrichment plus a wooden block, 2 tbls of sunflower seeds, or both a block and seeds respectively. there was no significant difference between the nongrinding group and grinding group that received sunflower seeds. the enrichment tested did not reduce the grinding observed. we used a dehumidifier in an attempt to bring the humidity back within the range where the embryo yield was hypothesized to be the highest (maximum 70% humidity) the dehumidifier remained in the room for one month and temperature and humidity levels were recorded. our institution can employ more technicians per rodent box than the standard 800-1,000 boxes/technician. allowing technicians to vary their daily duties between husbandry and technical work helps decrease repetitive work injuries. 100% of animal care staff AALAS certified, most (50%) at the highest LATG technologist level. nests were scored weekly according to the following system: 0-5; 0-undisturbed, 1-disturbed, 2-flat nest, 3-cup, 4-incomplete dome, or 5-complete dome. there was 100% use of the assigned enrichment product in all mouse groups, however, the extent of usage varied by strain. opportunistic infections in the colony have decreased to less than 3%. communication between veterinary, husbandry, and lab staff was vital to implementing a coordinated care and management plan to lower stress induced by human presence. fluorescein stain is used to assess if the cornea is ulcerated. this is critical to determining if topical medicine is necessary or if the defect is deep and painful enough to warrant enucleation. a system was created to prepare the fluorescein stain in advance. the method of preparing the fluorescein strips has simplified day-to-day assessment of ocular issues and increased veterinary technician compliance with standard diagnosis guidelines across our program. the additional bonus of reducing the waste of a full fluorescein strip per rodent. a heavy gross contaminant of biological matter adheres to tank surfaces. biofilm is necessary to the health of aquatic environments. pathogens inhabiting biofilm may compromise the health of fish. the fog only process outperformed wash only and significantly penetrated into the biofilm. 7% hydrogen peroxide pulse mist demonstrated a compelling improvement to the processes of decontamination in aquatic facilities. a common problem with metabolic caging is contamination with food particles that drop through the mesh cage flooring. exchanging pelleted diet (n=15) for diet gel (n=10) in an open food hopper also improved the average urine quality (4.1 to 2.1) using both of these methods decreases food contamination and generates better quality samples. the hide and go Squeak program was well received and increased employee engagement. the program enhanced our employee performance by reinforcing training. customized rodent change stations require technicians to walk cages between a cage rack and a stationary laminar flow change station. the process requires technicians to travel large cumulative distances (average of 12 mile per side of rack) to increase efficiency and decrease technician effort, we recently instituted a process in which technicians move mobile change stations to each rack. chlorine dioxide gas is a true gas, and when introduced via a generator, easily reaches every surface within the isolator. each isolator is exposed to chlorine dioxide gas to 720 ppm. mice were exposed to an average fluctuation of 7.5\u00b0C during transportation from our facility in Michigan to 7 institutions in the northeast, midwest, south, and southwestern regions of the united states in April and may 2019. results were categorized based on steps of the process: origin, ground agent; 2) origin, airline warehouse; 3) origin, cargo hold; 4) in-flight; 5) destination, cargo hold; 7) destination, airline warehouse; and 7) destination, ground agent. temperatures ranged from 7.4 1.5 (step 5) to 26.6 0.6\u00b0C (step 7) the most significant changes were seen during step 4 when temperatures decreased 10-20\u00b0C for flights lasting at least 100 min. temperatures in 4 shipments were not significantly different from local temperatures. nest quality was determined daily using a nest scoring system (0\u20135; poor\u2013best) over 7 d. the trial was expanded to a room with 800 cages, all receiving a dental roll weekly for 30 d. the trial was expanded to a 39-room facility (10,000 cages) groups of 11-22 unfamiliar females and 2-4 males were introduced in LBCs. average density was 22.9 ft2/animal in SBCs and 35.9 ft2/animal in LBCs. 57.1% of animals introduced remain in the groups 6-13 mo postintroduction. the new brush was large enough to withstand the force of passage through the plenum. the brush was dipped into a mop bucket of clean water prior to each passage. racks were processed in a standard rack washer and tilted to drain excess water. we autoclaved 3 bottles/caps as per our standard operating procedures. instead of discarding them after a single use, we reprocessed them 3 times. a sample of the water from within the bottle was taken and both culture and 16S qPCR was performed. the guinea pig caging was reallocated to a different campus only to have our program needs shift. the tubs were furnished with plastic huts, manipulanda, and feeding and watering devices appropriate for guinea pigs. the staff theorized that their inclination to hide was reserved for when people entered the room. the animals were introduced to a new style of caging, a solid-topped rabbit caging modified to house guinea pigs. the animals continued active behaviors regardless of the presence of staff in the room. the animals continued active behaviors regardless of the presence of the staff. rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) are reared in water with a salinity of 15g/L. salinity in a zebrafish tank is typically 1g/L. rotifers are typically fed live algae which have variable nutrition. our primary housing facility observed a rapid 52.9% increase in mouse census. we implemented a color-coded cagewash board to reduce supply circulation. a color-coded board allows staff to schedule their activities more efficiently. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) monitoring is a key part of the responsibilities of our comparative medicine department. we chose three different brands of disinfectant wipes currently available on the market. the results suggest that wipe 1 is the most efficacious product for our facility. implementing these practices would be recommended for application in animal care facilities. euthanasia scheduling staff rotations, grief education, and ways to acknowledge and show appreciation to our animal cohorts. the cost savings on equipment for this project was $1M. it required investing in an additional cargo truck to separate the transport of clean and soiled supplies around campus. animal care staff place orders for their cage wash supplies, and cage wash staff fill these orders. the new system is user friendly and allows for real-time communication of health concerns. veterinary staff can be notified of a new health case at any time or location. the software allows for designating appropriate treatments by veterinary staff. mice were divided into 4 groups based on bedding and feed types. regular diet + corncob bedding, 2) regular diet + paper bedding, 3) 60% high-fat diet + corncob bedding, and 4) 60% high-fat diet + paper bedding. body weight was monitored weekly for 11 wk. cross-foster rederivation has been used successfully in laboratory mice to clear pathogens such as MNV, Helicobacter, and MHV. cross-foster rederivation has been used successfully in laboratory mice to clear pathogens such as M. spicilegus. all serology tests on both foster dams and cross-fostered M. spicilegus pups were negative for all pathogens, including MPyV, MHV, and MNV. cross-foster rederivation can be used successfully across different Mus species to eliminate MPyV, MHV, and MNV infection. epoxies that withstand the Rigors of Autoclave chambers were tested first by using a mock unit that was placed in the autoclave on a cart. the epoxy was placed in the autoclave on a cart. if the epoxy held on the mock unit, the epoxy was ineffective. epoxy D was successful on adhering both the IFSS and swing door to our autoclave withstanding pressure and steam through 100s of autoclave cycles. the autoclave reached 250 degree F in both 25- and 45-min cycles. single-housed male rabbits experienced a 100% gain in weight compared with 115% gain in weight in pair-housed male rabbits. there were no significant differences between adult pair-housed rabbits (n=4) or single-housed male rabbits (n=2) over a 9-mo period. group 2 mice were carried on a cart (CC) for 15 min (17) and euthanized day 18. group 5 mice were HC for 15 min (17) and euthanized day 31. group 6 mice served as a control and were not removed from the study room. legacy system used an animal census database and an outdated database platform. the process involved multiple handling of the same data, subjecting data to human errors. the process involved multiple handling of the same data, subjecting data to human errors. the majority of anesthetic and analgesic agents used in research are controlled substances. distribution of these substances to research investigators is integral for providing appropriate anesthesia and analgesia to meet welfare and regulatory requirements. management of the distribution process for controlled drugs creates operational challenges. mice housed on soft cellulose bedding showed the highest activity followed by aspirated wood chips, corn cob bedding, paper chip bedding, and soft cellulose bedding. adult female SW mice (3/cage) were housed in IVC cages with corn cob bedding under standard husbandry practices for 1 month. mice are severely immunocompromised and used in the development of xenograft and patient derived tumor models to research novel medicines intended to treat various human cancers. in 2018, we unexpectedly experienced high morbidity and mortality in an NSG mouse colony housed in barrier conditions. a weekly sentinel program with NSG mice consists of histopathological examination of all segments of the gastrointestinal tract. samples of small intestine and feces are frozen for additional diagnostics as needed. a new system was developed for colonies of mice with rectal prolapse due to research-related or phenotypic issues. a veterinary technician fills out one side with the rectal prolapse grade (1-3 or mild to severe), the date it was last seen by the veterinary technician, and the clinical case number. once a grade 3 prolapse is reached, the card is flipped and on the opposite side is a request for the lab to euthanize their mice. an email is sent to the investigative staff to alert them to euthanize their mice. the system monitors the requirements for thousands of user accounts from multiple institutions. after a grace period, inaction results in withdrawal of access. the system\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly interface has also improved user satisfaction. a team of 3 temporary employees and 7 existing employees developed data lists and methods to validate the new platform. approximately 30 employees consisting of facility staff, administrative staff, veterinarians, and IACUC staff transferred all data and protocols into the new system manually over a 6-wk period. the successful CAFA data migration resulted in more accurate census and billing allowing a reduction in labor cost. vivarium doors and other hollow spaces within the vivarium require strong reconsideration for their potential to harbor vermin. no viral or parasitic agents were detected in the hollow space. the production room environment could serve the following purposes: to assess the risk for contamination of IVC cages from excluded organisms. we institute an environmental monitoring program that consists of monthly room air sampling using a microbial air sampler. results from up to 12 mo of monitoring indicate that our production rooms have surprisingly low levels of bacterial contaminants. chinchillas are often used for auditory research due to their accessible tympanic bullae and similarities to the human hearing range. chinchillas were housed in modified rabbit caging with custom-cut plexiglass solid flooring placed over a portion of the existing cage floor. the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is known as the most fertile anthropoid primate due to its multiparous tendencies, relatively short gestation (mean=143-144 d), and absence of a lactational anoestrus period. most of the endocrinologic tests used for pregnancy detection in humans and Old World primates are unreliable in marmosets. females marmosets are weighed for several weeks before the mating process begins to establish a baseline. a pregnant dam\u2019s weight has minimal change from baseline for the first and second trimester. a statistically significant inflection point of 30-50g occurs at approximately 103 d, from which it is possible to accurately predict the date of delivery. if a technician has 1,000 cages to change and 5 h of technical work for the week, this results in a total of 1250 cages or 250 cages per day. management expects 5 h of scheduled work per day. each technician\u2019s additional time can be used for ancillary assignments throughout the facility. tape was allocated to control, ultrasonic fogging, or soaking in liquid chlorine dioxide groups prior to incubation in hatching media. percent hatching between control and ultrasonic fogging groups were similar (78% and 80% respectively) and was less in the chlorine dioxide group (11%). autoclaved and nonautoclaved water bottles were stored in static polycarbonate rat cages measuring 10.5\u201d x 19\u201d x 8\u00bb, with 20 bottles per cage. water samples were submitted for bacterial culture and inorganic mineral analysis. we present specific challenges, environmental modifications, novel housing, and enrichment used while establishing, maintaining, and breeding a colony of spiny mice. the approaches outlined will serve as a resource for animal care and use programs required to house and breed species novel to their vivaria. managers have made significant progress in continuous improvement at the institutions which have implemented some or all of the tools. the tools, techniques, and assistance offered by the toolkit can equip managers with the confidence and capability to improve operations, efficiency, quality, and create an organizational culture of excellence. an alternative practice is creating individual biscuit counts for each primate based on biscuit consumption analysis and veterinarian consult. potential benefits include optimal body condition and reduced amount of leftover biscuits. however, time spent counting biscuits may offset time saved cleaning cages. study was conducted using CD-1 female mice housed 5 per cage. rodent caging accessories sampled were mouse igloos and wire bar feeders. swabs were analyzed in house with the ATP tester. mice were randomly distributed to 6 cages (5 mice per cage) each cage was subjected to 3 weeklong treatments replicated twice for each treatment over a 6-wk period. mice housed on corn cob bedding showed a modest but statistically significant increase in FBG levels. baboons have a biological need to socialize with conspecifics. but at times they may require privacy and a means to avoid conflict with others. nonhuman primate colonies housed in research settings are manipulated frequently due to research protocols, for breeding, and for veterinary procedures. the husbandry team is part of the comprehensive enrichment program that provides enrichment to 5000 nonhuman primates housed in both indoor and outdoor enclosures. the team uses surplus seasonal produce and donations from the community to take advantage of what is already available from the public to then pass on to enrich our animal\u2019s lives. an animal husbandry technician typically changes 200 mouse cages daily, lifting approximately 2,080 lbs. this routine procedure and the associated animal handling equate to repetitive motions that can be mentally and physically draining while also potentially causing stress on the animals. the prevalence rate of murine pathogens in our vivaria has not significantly increased since the transition. direct animal handling using gloved hands presents task refinement for personnel without compromising animal health. an approach for SOP creation, review, implementation and training has been developed. a large colony of 100 randomly sourced sled dogs are exercised outdoors in 3 separate fenced play yards twice daily. many challenges faced developing an appropriate exercise regime such as playgroup compatibility to avoid dog fights, staff communication, sanitation of the play yard. sled dog program is a unique system for addressing the exercise needs of the dogs. the main method of sterilization for supplies going into germfree flexible film isolators is using a slotted metal cylinder with an 18-in diameter opening. the refined procedure reduces the cost of wrapping a cylinder by about $190 per year just in high-temperature tape. a sterile germfree shipping container acts as a miniature flexible-film isolator without forced ventilation. the shipping container contains a 12-inch sleeve whereas our isolators come standard with an 18-inch port. the shipping container is sterilized in a blue surgical wrap material. a robust mouse identification system combines paw tattooing around postnatal (P) day 10 to distinguish littermates prior to genotype assignment, and ear notching at weaning (around postnatal day 21) each pup is entered into the electronic colony management system, and given a unique six-digit animal ID. the system allows for optimal usage of animal cage space in a complex transgenic mouse breeding colony. mouse MI top microbial loads do not increase until at least 2 wk and sanitation frequency may be delayed. it remains unclear how microbial loads differ on mouse versus rat MI tops, as well as across different ventilation systems. z, E Levee, SE Woods VelociGene, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY In an effort to address challenges in mouse pathogen exclusion and vivarium space use, our institution recently renovated a building to include a fully autonomous, 15,000 ft2, 104 isolator mouse production facility. the facility is equipped with a variety of methods to ensure all materials entering the vivarium are pathogen-free, if not sterile, including our new MPF successfully enable dependable, in-house sourcing of opportunistic pathogen-free mice necessary for our institution\u2019s business-critical research and development. our facility was faced with an unavoidable water outage that would affect thousands of cages that are dependent on an automatic watering system. fecal and oral samples were collected before diet change and 2.5 wk after change from a representative subset of beagles. fecal and oral samples were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize microbial microbiota. weight, body condition, and need for dietary modification were assessed monthly for the entire colony. weight, body condition, and need for dietary modification were assessed monthly for the entire colony. this is the first study to investigate microbiome of laboratory beagles. endothelial cells become infected with CMV, serving as a site for viral persistence in multiple organs, including in the salivary gland, spleen, and lungs. the formation of PEAs, namely PEA formation, contributes to platelet decline post murine CMV infection. despite ongoing studies in wild and captive populations, little is known about their normal physiology. the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), suborder Yangochiroptera, is used as an animal model for several viruses. the rabbit model helped elucidate the development of the subsynovial connective tissue over time. the rabbit model helped elucidate the development of the subsynovial connective tissue over time. the maximum number of consecutive days mice can be successfully dosed via tail vein is 14 days. a method development study was conducted in preparation for 2 developmental and reproductive toxicology studies involving male and female fertility. twenty-five male CD1 mice were implanted with jugular catheters attached to externalized ports. 84% of the externalized ports were patent for dosing. at wk 13, 52% remained patent for dosing. Surgically implanted catheters and externalized ports allow for more consecutive daily IV bolus injections. mice in the 3/4 nephrectomy group had lower blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine with a higher urine creatinine and kidney to body weight ratio. results consistent with a more severe compromise to renal function in the 5/6 nephrectomy surgical model of renal failure. the condition was inherited as a recessive trait with a median head tremor onset of 4.6 mo in both males (n=4) and females (n=6) cytoplasmic vacuolation was seen in a wider range of epithelia (gall bladder, bile duct, urinary bladder, renal tubular, bronchiolar, and mammary gland epithelium) gous mutant mice (Hexblysd/lysd and Hexbtm1Rlp/tm1Rlp) developed tremors, while no tremors were observed in either heterozygous genotype during an 8+-mo period. the prevalence of genotoxin-encoding E. coli in cats is unknown. free cats presented with resorptions, stillbirths, and pyometras in >50% of pregnancies. PCR was performed to determine the presence of pks, cnf, and cdt genes. pks-/cnf+/cdt-, 13 (46.4%) were cnf+, 10 (35.7%) were cdt+. the pks+/cnf+/cdt+ isolate had 189 base pair deletion in the cnf gene that may truncate the protein. the genomes were most similar to E. coli cultured from human patients with urinary tract infections and bacteremia. 80% of buprenorphine HCl mice survived for 14 d while saline and buprenorphine sustained-release polymer groups had only 40% survival. 80% of the buprenorphine HCl mice survived for 14 d while saline and buprenorphine sustained-release polymer groups had only 40% survival. activity, orbital tightness, posture, and piloerection were assessed at each postoperative time point. 25 of 38 male mice produced FiUSV 4 of the 5 d (143 93 syllables, mean SD) vasectomized mice without postoperative analgesia produced significantly fewer FiUSV 4 h postoperatively. male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups: 1) placebo tablet; 2) buprenorphine sustained release at 1.2 mg/kg subcutaneously once; 3) gabapentin 90 mg/tablet; 4) carprofen 5 mg/tablet; and 5) gabapentin 90 mg and carprofen 5 mg/tablet (gabapentin/carprofen) gabapentin/carprofen group attenuated only mechanical hypersensitivity on d 2 and 3. both gabapentin and carprofen effectively attenuate postoperative mechanical hypersensitivity for 3 days postsurgery in a rat model of incisional pain. the results indicated that use of a PMSG treatment did not have a significant effect on kindling rate (P = 0.414) the PMSG group had a significantly smaller mean litter size (8.6 kits vs. 10.0 kits) and a significantly smaller mean of live kits born per doe (7.9 kits compared with. 9.1 kits) than the control group. a tree shrew whole-genome analysis revealed a genetic relationship between tupaias and humans. it has been documented that tree shrews are susceptible to infections with HCV. the primary tupaia hepatocytes (PTHs) have been proved to be infected by HCV. we used BM-MSCs, derived from the tree shrew, to establish a HCV cell model. based on the cell model, we will reinfuse cells which transfected CD81/OCLN/miR-122 in the hope that they colonize themselves in the liver. the results show that all cages of mice in the nest puck treatment group showed no barbering. all cages of mice in the other 2 treatment groups had obvious barbering. further examination is needed to elucidate the behavior of mice housed in these treatment groups. alterations in expression with endothelial cells, tight junction proteins, tight junction adaptor proteins, basement membrane, and pericytes. the triple blast model demonstrated a 1.87-fold decrease (P = 0.028) in PDGFR- expression compared to that of the single blast. the mouse is surgically sutured and sterilely prepared for surgery. a wedge of liver is surgically removed and a similar-sized piece of absorbable gelatin is put in its place to stop any bleeding. the mouse is surgically sutured and analgesia is administered (0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine) stapled closed. the standard formulation of buprenorphine HCl (0.3mg/ml) is typically administered every 8 to 12. the use of compounded sustained-released buprenorphine has increased to provide up to 72 h of continuous analgesia following a single injection. the sustained release buprenorphine had a peak concentration of 3.1 ng/ml at 2 h. the sustained release had a peak concentration of 3.1 ng/ml at 2 h. the neonatal ferret is an attractive species in which to model preterm brain injury because it has a white-to-gray matter ratio similar to the human (unlike rodents) kits received 3mg/kg of LPS followed by bilateral carotid artery (HIH) ligation and consecutive HIH (30 min at 9%, 30 min at 80%, 30 min at 9%) at P42, gait and spontaneous activity were determined in an automated catwalk and open field. duri2 1Neurooncology and Translational Research, Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, WI; 3Oncology, Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, WI More than 300,000 women per year are diagnosed with breast cancer. if treated appropriately and timely, the risk of recurrence and metastasis in patients with luminal B breast cancer could be significantly reduced. younger mice developed tumors in within 8-12 wk. older mice failed to develop measurable tumors. PDX cells in-vitro demonstrated more sensitivity to MK1775 than patient cells. femoral catheterization was highly favorable and more successful with a 100% fetal viability and consistent reliable blood draws. the method of jugular/carotid line placement did not reliably allow for blood sampling over the duration of 7 days. three rat models of inherited retinal degenerative blindness were generated on the Sparge Dawley background via CRISPR-based deletion of the genes Pde6b, Rpgr, and Rho. animals were genotyped via genomic PCR. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia provided by buprenorphine HCl (Bup HCl) and lidocaine (LDC) in an incisional pain model. d 3 Sprague Dawley rat pups randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups. a single preoperative dose of Bup HCl 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg SC effectively attenuates postoperative thermal hypersensitivity in a neonatal rat incisional pain model. the recent FDA approval of 5 immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/L1 has created the potential to significantly improve outcomes in UC patients. mice were kept under anesthesia for 3 h prior to and then during PET scanning. normal systemic biodistribution concentrated the radiolabeled drug in liver and spleen. radiolabeled drug remained exclusively in the bladder without any appreciable extra-bladder biodistribution. nTS is important in the body\u2019s response to hypoxia. changes in nTS function are associated with diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea. decreased afferent input modulates nTS astrocyte morphology. changes in afferent input thus may play a role in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and modifying these changes could contribute to treatment regimens. ova were incubated in a hatching medium for 6 h. control tapes were maintained at room temperature without fog/mist exposure. exposure to both environmental and surface sprayer systems decreased the number of ova hatched vs controls. in this study, we created 15 cMDVs by diluting meloxicam with sterile water (dilution 1:10) cMDVs were punctured once daily for 30 d. the stability of 7 cMDVs were assessed on days 0, 10, 20, 30, and 365. transgenic mice become spontaneously diabetic and are used as a model of type 2 diabetes to test plant-derived proprietary compounds for their ability to slow diabetes progression. the compound was administered in drinking water ad libitum to hA transgenic (n=13) and non-transgenic (n=9) mice from age 21 d. a new model on the market, the B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd (R2G2) knockout mouse, lacks responsiveness to common gamma chain cytokines. this model exhibits defects in lymphoid development. the 1000 mm3 threshold by day 20-35 postinjection for all cell lines tested. a definitive diagnosis was established for approximately half of the cases. many of the undiagnosed cases had a clinical sign of neurologic symptoms. fenbendazole is a methylcarbamate benzimidazole antiparasitic agent that has been used to treat murine pinworms through premedicated feed. however, premedicated feed is costly and therefore unfeasible. a fenbendazole oral suspension is approved for use in the drinking water of poultry. mice were kept under strict quarantine conditions. fenbendazole is approved for use in the drinking water of poultry. sedative and anesthetic agents used for these studies are known to influence bladder function. five adult male cats were sedated 3 times with each of 3 agents. dexmedetomidine had the shortest time to lateral recumbency, as well as the shortest time to head up and ambulation. genistein treatment of canine inflammatory mammary cancer xenograft. genistein has been proposed to provide beneficial effects on health. genistein has been proposed to provide beneficial effects on health. the xenograft was directly established from a 9-y-old female dog with a spontaneous inflammatory mammary carcinoma. genistein ingestion promotes tumour proliferation and elevates metastatic rates by increasing intratumoural and circulating estrogen levels in a mammary cancer. PDX model is the only system that can accommodate full heterogeneity and variability of solid tumors. the PDX model has been hindered by spontaneous lymphomagenesis, which is highly suspected to be caused by EBV. a new technique was performed on 3 different litters for a total of 33 Sprague Dawley pups. five/33 pups had a scab and/or swelling at the injection site. all microchips were still intact and working. the injection technique was refined throughout the trial. effective method of identification for PND 1 pups will minimize identification issues, allow for direct data capture, and eliminate the risk of trauma to the pups\u2019 digits and digits. prairie voles may be useful in examining how different social stressors may affect response to acute trauma and recovery from injury. arterial whole blood was collected and processed using CG4+ and Chem8+ cartridges. lactate decreased from 7.7 mmol/L to 4.9 2.3 mmol/L, BUN increased from 26 2 mg/dL to 38 8 mg/dL. mice of 2 age groups were placed on either 400 mg/kg tamoxifen citrate diet or 500 mg/kg tamoxifen diet (TAM, n=21) the \u201cyoung\u201d subset of these mice were 7 wk of age and the \u201cold\u201d subset ranged between 20 and 24 wk of age (n=13 on TAMC and n=15 on TAM) interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) has been shown to inhibit the proestrus luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in female rats. in male gonadectomized rats, IL-1 delivered via intraperitoneal injection does not alter LH secretion, so the effect of IL-1 may depend on gonadal steroids. data indicate that estradiol is necessary for peripheral IL-1 to suppress LH. first, we performed a study (n=13) to measure pulsatile LH prior to and following IP administration of 20ng/g IL-1 or saline (control) in ovariectomized C57bl6 mice pretreated with estradiol. alfaxalone (Alf; 8 mg/kg IM) compared to ketamine (Ket; 20 mg/kg IM) alone or ketamine + dexmedetomidine (Ket/Dex; 4 mg/kg + 25 g/kg IM) with reversal (atipamezole; 250 g/kg IM) a total of 34 animals were evaluated, including 11 juveniles and 23 adults. mice with thermal jackets retained greater body heat, losing only 2-4 degrees (males=2C; females=4C) over the same interval. mice with thermal jackets retained greater body heat, losing only 2-4 degrees (males=2C; females=4C) Tns2 is a multidomain protein composed of a PTPase (PTP) domain at the N-terminus, and Src homology 2 (SH2)/phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at the C-terminus. however, little is known about the function of both domains. Tns2 wild-type (WT), PTP inactivated mutant (C231S), SH2-PTB domain deleted mutant (C) to HCT116. significant reduction of migration was observed in WT, but no difference was observed in C231S and C. mice induce hydrosalpinx, disruption of epithelial architecture, neutrophils in genital organs, suggesting intravaginal infection as natural route of C. trachomatis infection and replication. using this model and defined phenotype will substantially accelerate discovery of next generation antibiotics and vaccines. mice were observed for 3 d prior to inoculation, then at 4, 12, 20, 28, 36,45, 53, and 61 h after inoculation. orbital tightening increased during the first 12 h postinoculation. by 28 h postinoculation, appearance, activity, grooming, and nesting activity were absent. the rise of antibiotic resistance due to overuse of antibiotics is a growing concern. the rise of antibiotic resistance due to overuse of antibiotics is a growing concern. UD cases were randomly assigned to 2 groups, 6 mice treated with TAO and 6 mice treated with hypochlorous acid gel. u.s. adults were diagnosed with rhinosinusitis in 2016. this condition impacts the quality of life for sufferers. u.s. adults were diagnosed with the condition in 2016. the tissue was fixed in 10% formaldehyde, decalcified, sectioned, and stained with H&E, gram stain, and periodic acid-Schiff. treated animals had >50% improvement of their sinusitis compared to saline controls. the rabbit preclinical sinusitis model was refined by using a human CT scoring system. the mutant mice did not differ from WT mice in physical and reflexology development from birth to 3 wk of age. motor impairment was reported in adult mutant along with tremor, ataxia, and spontaneous seizures that can be observed around postnatal day 21. this mutation might represent an animal model for spontaneous seizures. the concentration of 5-HT (P = 0.0083) and 5HIAA (P = 0.0032) in mutant mice was significantly increased in the hippocampus compared with that WT mice. the contents of GABA (P = 0.0123), glutamate (P = 0.0217) and aspartate (P = 0.0124) were significantly increased in the hippocampus in the mutant. the IC data showed a 0.68\u00b0C lower T than NM (P 0.01). the IT showed higher T readings than IC by an average of 1.2\u00b0C (P 0.01). we believe the higher T finding in IT could be due to the heat generated by the digestion of the high fat/high sugar diet. serum IgE elevation has been shown in Swiss Webster, C57BL/6NCrl, and BALB/cAnNCrl mice. topical application of imidacloprid/moxidectin at 13/3mg/kg is effective treatment for D. musculi in TRP1/TCR mice after 8 consecutive weekly treatments. mice were housed with a Demodex-positive mouse for 42 d. D. musculi is an important pathogen to exclude in allergy or atopy studies where IgE levels are important. current testing methods include fur pluck, deep skin scrape, biopsy, and PCR assay. each strain (n=5) were euthanized 14, 28, 56, and 112 d postexposure to a Demodex-positive or Demodex-negative NSG mouse. mite burdens in NSG mice continued to increase while they plateaued at a considerably lower (100-fold) level in immunocompetent strains. six male and six female Sprague-Dawley rats were selected after FCRA was diagnosed via indirect ophthalmoscopy during screening of populations purchased for unrelated toxicology studies. two males and 2 females were euthanized at time points 2, 4, and 6 mo. buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist commonly found in rodent surgery protocols as a postsurgical analgesic. a more convenient dosing schedule may increase compliance, thereby increasing the welfare of the rodents after surgical manipulation. mice tend toward hyperalgesic behavior at time points as far as 120 h postinjection. the main side effect observed was hypoactivity in doses above 5 mg/kg. further studies are necessary to determine whether these doses are appropriate to treat type C fiber-associated pain. group B had slightly shorter average surgical times (35.5 min compared with 38 minutes), but the animals experienced more postoperative complications with the ventral neck incision. subsequent carotid accesses became increasingly difficult due to repeated ligations. compared to mice on the trans fat diet at 12 wk of age (n=6 per time point), C57BL/6NTac mice gained weight more quickly and had similar liver weights. at 16 wk on diet, C57BL/6NTac mice (n=10) were obese, with enlarged, fatty livers. the humanized mouse is created via a multistep process, which begins with irradiation of an immunodeficient mouse to deplete any native immune cells. the mice are then injected with human CD34+ hematopoietic cells, which develop into the various cellular components of the human immune system. as mice are communal animals, this mobile freedom often leads to huddling behavior. the use of individual partitions when irradiating mice does not affect human engraftment levels, though there is some donor-specific evidence to suggest that myeloid engraftment is impacted. the use of individual partitions when irradiating mice does not affect human engraftment levels. both swine and sheep have anatomical features of the middle/inner ear similar to humans. the surgical approach through the middle ear to reach the TM is complex. both species could be used using similar surgical approach. china-origin (IO) rhesus macaques are the current model of choice for malaria vaccines studies. since 1978, there has been a ban on importing IO rhesus macaques making research with these animals difficult due to the increase in demand. dermatitis can be treated most efficiently by 10% chlorhexidine solution [spray], sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution [spray], standard triple antibiotic ointment, and ophthalmic triple antibiotic ointment. dermatitis can be treated most efficiently by 10% chlorhexidine solution [spray] small mammal pets are rarely evaluated for genotoxin-encoding E. coli strains. a total of 65 pets, including mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, were screened. all genotoxin-encoding isolates belonged to the pathogen-associated phylogenetic group B2. representative genotoxin-encoding isolates had serotypes previously associated with clinical disease in humans and animals. bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from guinea pigs were used as an in vitro cell model of inflammatory macrophages preferentially infected by M. tuberculosis in vivo. initial results show reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improved cellular viability in all treatment groups. ome 4 in mice (C57BL/6N) by TAKE method with Cas9 proteins and 2 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting both ends of the gene cluster. we measured urinary protein concentrations in Mup-KO and wild-type mice. geneic Model P Collier*, J Yang, M Cheng The Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA Aging has been directly correlated to the likelihood of developing cancer. most tumor research is done in young, healthy mice while the actual cancer population tends to be older. the purpose of this study is to begin establishing tumor models in aged mice. the observed differences could bridge the gap between successful preclinical cancer studies and successful clinical trials. the A1Care report is more specific in detection and screening of Type 2 diabetes mellitus adult nonhuman primates than the commercial laboratory A1c test. nondiabetic adult rhesus macaques ranges from 4% to 5.7% binding of A1C to hemoglobin. study supports the use of A1Care for the detection of diabetes mellitus in adult rhesus macaques. fish were then exposed for 6 mo to subinhibitory concentrations of SMX. exposure of fish to the NOEC, a dose approximately 80-fold lower than the MIC, resulted in a 10,000 fold increase in resistant colonies. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on the scanner, imaged for 15 min, and then euthanized for postmortem autoradiography. results showed that there is a significant sexual dimorphism in blood glucose levels and regional brain PET uptake. this suggests these factors should be not only reported but controlled for all imaging studies where glucose is being monitored. potency of the purified protein was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay (MFIA\u00ae) purified 57kD VP1-protein was assessed by staining of SDS-PAGE gels and western blot (WIB) analysis. a prevalence of >15% in the population. the standard method for an orthotopic breast cancer involves surgically clearing the mammary fat pad prior to engrafting the cells or tissue. in this study, we developed a nonsurgical approach where the PDX tissue is engrafted directly into a noncleared MFP using a method similar to SQ engraftment. daily ketamine administration does not alter the GM of mice used in research. daily administration of 100 mg/kg ketamine for 10 d significantly alters the GM of mice used in research. three Yucatan minipigs, two G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, and two Yorkshire cross domestic pigs were euthanized and injected intramuscularly (IM) and subcutaneously (SC) with 2 mL of dye solution. IM injections were performed in the cervical and hind limb musculature using 3 needle lengths (0.75, 1, and 1.5 inch) cervical IM injections in Yucatans and 1 inch for IM hindlimb injections in G\u00f6ttingens and Yorkshires provided accurate delivery into targeted muscles. this may be due to IM injections occasionally being deposited within intramuscular fascial planes. this may be due to IM injections occasionally being deposited within intramuscular fascial planes. two fecal pellets (approximately 60mg) were vortexed with steel beads with the same mass of isotonic buffer. the supernatant was then passed through a 0.2m filter twice. the sample contained 8.891010 +/- 1.79109particles/ml of exosomes, ranging from 75\u2013150 nm in size. at 18 wk, animals were distributed to treatment groups based upon ALT, PIIINP, and NAS. at 18 wk, animals were distributed to groups based upon ALT, PIIINP, and NAS. a porcine model of progressive LVPO and HFpEF progression was developed using an implantable hydraulic system allowing for sequential increases in LVPO. this requires a surgical team to perform the aortic surgery in Yorkshire pigs, provide pre and post-operative management, and perform serial assessment of left ventricular function. a large animal model of LVPO and HFpEF can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for this progressive and fatal disease. the development of the patient-derived PDX mouse model has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy research by fast-tracking the start of clinical trials. one-point injection (compound being directed to the tumor center) and fanning injection (compound being directed across several areas of the tumor) techniques were trialed. the mice received the same 10-d dosing regimen, with 2 groups receiving one-point injections and 2 groups receiving fanning injections. two IVC racks were each populated with 2 infected mice cages. a third IVC rack, with cages containing mice noninfected with LCMV, was used as negative control. LCMV copy number in all samples was very low (1-10 copies). study uses ultrasonography of the neck, inguinal, and flank of domestic Yorkshire farm swine (n=6) to define thickness of dermal and subcutaneous tissue strata as a function of age and weight. swine neck, inguinal, and flank anatomy are sites for injection assessment. neck has the thickest dermis (4mm), twice of inguinal or flank (2mm) and literature for typical human dermis (2mm) the flank has the largest surface area (294cm2 total) allowing for higher n value studies requiring more swine. the first color change occurred on day 7 where ammonia levels for all 8 sensors changed from low to low-medium. a low reading indicates ammonia levels of 0-1 ppm. the second major color change occurred on day 14 where the levels changed to medium. a concentrated formulation of buprenorphine HCl labeled for use in cats with recommended dosing every 24 h is commercially available. males and females were injected with 1 of the 3 buprenorphine formulations at a dose of 1mg/kg subcutaneously at time 0. Groups of mice (n=8) were sacrificed at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 h for all groups. ers Squibb, Redwood City, CA Frozen sections are usually used when there is a need to preserve nucleic acids or when the antigen being visualized by IHC is sensitive to crosslinking fixation techniques. freezing in liquid nitrogen remains the gold standard for RNA preservation and produces the highest quality RNA. the 1-methoxyheptafluoropropane is less toxic and flammable than Hexane and 2-methylbutane, and offers a safer method for freezing tissues. an incisional pain model was used to determine the effects of buprenorphine on pain, appetite, and fecal output. three rabbits received maropitant 10 mg/kg SC for pharmacokinetic sampling. samples were taken 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after drug administration. some rabbits tolerated less pressure with von Frey testing. the right saphenous artery, right cephalic artery, right femoral artery, right cephalic artery, left cephalic artery, left femoral artery, left saphenous vein, and the left cephalic vein. swine vessels showed no differences when comparing the left and right sides. rabbit models of ocular diseases are particularly useful, since rabbits share more common anatomical and biochemical features with humans compared to rodents. rabbits can be easily handled and share more common anatomical and biochemical features with humans compared to rodents, such as longer life spans and larger eye size. rabbit can be used for DME research. YS Moreno*, J Stathopoulos, T Caron Comparative Medicine, The Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA Sustained-release buprenorphine is widely used as a postoperative analgesic in mice. blood concentrations of mice treated with BUP-SR after isoflurane exposure rose to 1.4 ng/mL at 180 min post administration (P = 0.0003) remained above 1.2ng/mL for 24 h (P = 0.01) and fell to levels comparable with animals dosed before isoflurane exposure at 48 h. timing of treatment relative to administration of isoflurane anesthesia may lead to profound differences in blood buprenorphine levels in mice. stained sperm stained with NAO, mitochondrial cardiolipin binding dye, and MitoTracker Red, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dye. sperms were treated with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in damaged sperm with low motility rate (14.6%) in ICGN mice is caused by the deletion mutation in the Tensin2(Tns2) gene. it is a focal adhesion-localized multidomain protein expressed in various tissues. its dysfunction leads to alterations in podocytes. heavy metal and pesticide analyses have been performed on 15 lab animal diets for 25 years. the QA pesticide screen included 22 of the 23 pesticides on the certified diet list. since 1990 14 of the pesticides listed for certified diets have been banned from use. literature review reveals that animals engaged in positive reinforcement training display less stress, aggression, and stereotypical behaviors due to the sense of control, human interaction, and psychological enrichment. previous studies have shown that clicker training shelter dogs led to decreased barking and an increase in positive behavior changes. standard institutional interventions provided to the NHPs to curb FS include destructible enrichment (e.g. box filled with paper and food items), expanded cage space, or a water cup filled with food-grade baking extract as needed. the use of finger paints as a novel intervention would lead to a reduction of FS in NHPs. continuous and noncontinuous breeding trios of C57BL/6 mice followed longitudinally over 18 wk. a total of 20 cages were followed, 5 per study condition. no significant difference in breeding efficiency between groups. design that uses perforated false bottom to hold bedding was compared with a traditional IVC system housing 5 diabetic mice per cage. the novel IVC system was changed 3 times per week, and the novel IVC system changed once per week. intracage T and RH may be affected by factors including macroenvironment, cage type, animal number, activity, bedding, and cage change frequency. we hypothesized that T and RH are higher in static versus individually ventilated (IVC) cages. Approximately 20% of our census are immunocompromised, including NSGTM mice. 19 cases reported in a 6-mo window versus our typical annual caseload of 1-2 cases. two factors potentially contributing to the increase included a new staff member and the introduction of Staphylococcus xylosus. the need to generate strain-specific animals at germ-ree health status in vivo also arises. this derivation process is technically difficult when limited to working within the microenvironment of the flexible film isolators. the historical approach to germfree isolator work relies on large quantities of toxic chemicals to clean up the macroenvironment. visual cues were initiated in order to indicate to the rabbits what activity was about to occur. the rabbits were exposed to laminated signage which hung on the wall facing all caging. the team used signs consisting of 1 colored shape designated for each procedure type. a 2-year-old, intact female tree shrew presented for recurrent mild periocular dermatitis. a fluctuant, subcutaneous, 1.5cm x 1.0cm mass at her second left abdominal mamma was identified. a fine needle aspirate was taken of the mass revealing a uniform population of neoplastic epithelial cells. a 1-y-old male ferret was examined for lethargy, weight loss, and pale mucous membranes. the animal was anesthetized with 1-5% isoflurane in an induction chamber. it was maintained on 1-3% isoflurane for a jugular blood collection. the animal was prescribed erythropoietin (150 IU/kg IM), iron dextran (10mg/kg IM), ad lib carnivore care (6.4 tbsp dry/kg PO) and daily polyvit (0.5mL PO) for 4 d. the anemia was unresponsive to therapy after three days. the macaque was dyspneic with pale blue mucus membranes. the indwelling right internal jugular catheter was flushing appropriately. fluoroscopy evaluation revealed restricted inflation of lungs and a large, round, stationary cardiac silhouette. male chimera mouse was examined for 2 discrete swellings with dorsal deviations along the tail. the proximal swelling was located at the tail base, with a narrowed, circumferential area of apparent constriction caudally. radiographs of the animal revealed a significant amount of soft tissue opacity in the areas of the swellings, caudal vertebrae malformations, and mild lysis of the dorsal aspect. teratomas are most commonly described in the reproductive organs of animals. but spontaneous teratomas are seen more often in younger animals. the presence of pulmonary metastasis makes this an unusual finding. bital injection containing either 1 million B6.129S2-Ifnar1tm1Agt/Mmjax or B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88tm1.1Defr/J cells with 1 million B6.SJL cells. mice were euthanized, and 2 were submitted for necropsy. no further clinical evidence of facial edema or mortality were noted. this case emphasizes the differences between irradiation sources and their effects on dose dependent clinical signs. gmatic serosa, numerous adhesions, and an anterior uterine/cervical leiomyoma were herniated through a rent in the diaphragm, leading to atelectasis of the left caudal lung lobe. invasive endometriosis found within the membranous portion of the diaphragm likely led to the weakening of and fenestrations within the tissue, allowing for cholelithiasis, cholangitis, amyloidosis, neoplasia, or a gallbladder mucocele have been diagnosed. cholelithiasis, cholangitis, amyloidosis, neoplasia, or a gallbladder mucocele have been reported. a 13-y-old, 4.5 kg male castrated domestic shorthair cat presented with episodic syncope and signs consistent with cardiogenic shock. physical exam revealed pale and tacky mucous membranes, decreased peripheral pulse strength, mild dehydration estimated at 5-7%. an intravenous catheter was placed and 50 mLs of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered. AV block and the cat remained clinically stable. no cardiogenic or systemic cause of the AV block was determined. the cat was removed from the study and was placed for adoption. necropsy revealed an enlarged, friable liver; histopathology confirmed hepatic lipidosis. the ultimate cause of hepatic lipidosis in this nonanorectic rabbit remains unknown. prolonged lactation may have been a precipitating factor. a 2-mo-old female C57BL/6J mouse presented with a left-sided head tilt. the animal had been provided a purified high fat diet (AIN-93) ad libitum. the animal was euthanized due to poor prognosis. a 9-year-old female Xenopus laevis was reported for a white growth on its left leg. on physical exam, the frog was quiet and had a white, cotton-like mass on the left tarsus. both eyes had white corneal opacities that were easily irritated and bled freely. the final diagnosis was a multi-organ, T cell lymphoma. the presence of Saprolegnia warrants investigation into both environmental and pathological causes of immunocompromise in Xenopus laevis. mice were fed a chemically defined amino acid diet with menadione (MD) as the form of vitamin K. phylloquinone (PK) is a synthetic, water-soluble form of vitamin K used in diets for multiple species. Crohn\u2019s disease is 1 of 2 chronic inflammatory bowel diseases that affect the lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. several environmental factors contribute in large part to the multifactorial etiology of this disease. a knock-in rat model harboring an ATG16L1 gene variant responsible for increased CD predisposition in humans. histologic signs included multifocal liver necrosis and multifocal areas of lamina propria inflammation, mucosal erosion, and transmural ulceration of the ileum and colon. further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying why this genetic variant causes increased sensitivity to NSAID administration resulting in CD-like lesions. cloacae from a nonhuman primate open craniotomy site demonstrated bacterial attenuation at our selected doses to validate antimicrobial efficacy. the selected doses caused neither behavioral changes postoperatively, as measured by cageside observation for pain behaviors or neurologic abnormalities. 10 C57BL/6 female mice were superovulated with either AIS or PMSG. a subset of fresh embryos were immediately cultured to assess their developmental potential to blastocyst stage. DR is the most common neurovascular complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 140 million diabetics worldwide. a sustained release, insulin-loaded, biodegradable nanogel system was developed as a potential long-term therapeutic to rescue retinal neurons from apoptosis. Scotopic ERG measurements were performed on both diabetic and non-diabetic control rats after two hour dark adaptation one day before, one week after, and two weeks after treatment. results suggest that the insulin-loaded nanogels improved photoreceptor and amacrine cell function in diabetic rats. a one-time injection of analgesics at the time of intratibial injection of PCa cells would have no effect on tumor growth. mice were injected subcutaneously with an analgesic (carprofen 5 mg/kg or buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline 0.1 ml) at the time of intratibial injection with PCa cells. male and female Crl:CD1(ICR) mice were given a single IP dose of ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg or etomidate 20 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg. physiologic parameters, anesthetic time points, and mortality rate were evaluated. male NU/J showed moderate-severe acidosis as compared to males of other strains. X IP anesthesia may only be acceptable as a safe and effective alternative to KX anesthesia in C57BL/6NCrl mice. the variability among mouse strains and between sexes requires further investigation to optimize IP EX dosage. rabbits in the CsA group and one rabbit in the anti-CD4 group showed signs of illness such as hyporexia, decreased fecal output, and lethargy. qPCR analysis of spleen cells proved more diagnostic than PBLs. a model of epidural infusion was used for percutaneous epidural catheter placement in each anesthetized animal with concurrent carprofen analgesia. behavior was assessed prior to catheter placement and during vehicle infusions using a modified visual analog scale (VAS) by 2 blinded veterinarians. swine offer a robust platform to test tolerability of novel agents intended for use in the awake patient. swine were premedicated with intramuscular midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, butorphanol 0.3 mg/kg and xylazine 4 mg/kg. at the start of the lab, isoflurane was discontinued. a second group of swine (n=4) received 1 ml/kg bolus of guaifenesin 0.1% ketamine and 0.1% xylazine (GKX) the differences in mean arterial pressure and heart rate between protocols can be attributed to the action of xylazine in the GKX protocol. both protocols present viable options for use in swine and can be used preferentially based on drug availability and targeted length of anesthesia. four of 10 animals were from the following strains: NOD/ShiLtJ [NOD], NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid>IL2rgtm1Wjl>/SzJ [aka NOD scid gamma, or NSG]. none of these cases had gross or histologic evidence of luminal obstruction. ula into the Cecum of a Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was castrated to remove the influence of testosterone on the variable of study. a 2-incision method was used, incising over each testicle in the scrotum, exteriorizing the testicle, clamping and ligating the vessels and spermatic cord with absorbable suture. a postmortem exam revealed a fistula formation between a previous abscess and the cecum through the body wall of the mouse. this case highlights possible unusual sequelae to a relatively straightforward surgical procedure. an optimal phenotype requires postweaning oral gavage with Helicobacter hepaticus. bacteria in the genus Helicobacter present in the mid-jejunal contents of all control mice analyzed. a PCR to screen for H. hepaticus was then performed in the remaining breeding animals. the colony was reestablished, and routine screening of mice was implemented. despite increased monitoring, 2 mice were found dead and 3 moribund mice were euthanized 3 d later. one mouse exhibited severe neurologic signs, with lateral recumbence, opisthotonus, and paddling. mice were infected with H. pylori (SS1) and fed a chemically defined amino acid diet containing 2 mg folate/kg. eighteen weeks postinfection, specific cohorts were switched to an 8 mg/kg folate diet and/or received helicobacter eradication therapy consisting of omeprazole (400 mol/kg/day), metronidazole (14.2 mg/kg/day) and clarithromycin (7.15 mg/kg/day mice on 8 mg/kg folate diet had pale tissues, a pale and friable liver, and a stomach filled with unclotted blood. at 24 WPI, 2 mice on 8 mg/kg folate diet that did not receive antibiotics were also found dead with the same findings on necropsy. the baboon (Papio anubis) has been developed as a bladder augmentation model. there is a paucity of information with regards to complications. a retrospective review of 24 patients (12 males, 12 females) was performed. 10-y-old female common marmoset presented with cervical swelling and bruising. further evaluation revealed poor dentition with significant gingival recession and pytalism. diagnostics included CBC, serum chemistry, and pharyngeal culture. a large yellow-brown cystic left thyroid mass extending dorsomedial to the larynx with associated lateral deviation of the trachea was noted. histologic findings consistent with thyroid follicular carcinoma in a common marmoset. the animal was started on antiviral (galvancyclovir 13mg/kg), antiinflammatory (prednisone 1mg/kg), antimicrobial (ceftiofur 20mg/kg) and gastroprotectant (famotidine 0.5mg/kg), all of which were negative. an intact amniotic sac measuring 18mm in diameter was surrounded by echogenic fluid within the placenta, distending the placental lumen to 33 x 46 mm. the amniotic sac was visible, and the placenta remained distended with fluid, suggesting that the fetus died at approximately 48 d of gestation. nonhuman primates may represent a subchorionic hemorrhage or hydroallantois. medical options include administration of oxytocin, misoprostol, or mifepristone as initial treatment. many workplace injuries can be prevented by proactively identifying jobs or tasks with a higher injury risk. over a period of 2 y, we have seen a 38% reduction in the total number of injuries reported. over a period of 2 y, we have seen a 34.8% reduction in the number of injuries categorized as WMSDs. the daily MMP targets improved posture and body mechanics, maintaining flexibility in movements that offset ergonomic risks in AST and strategic strengthening to increase musculoskeletal resilience. ROI is estimated to be 10.0 for the whole site with a potential cost avoidance of up to $102,059 for the department. collaborators evaluated the available toxicity and health hazard data for humans and specific animal models. the majority of chemicals fit within 3 CCLs, with some chemicals needing to be handled at a higher CCL for administration and a lower CCL for animal housing. lab animal care provider may be experiencing compassion fatigue. we are designing a novel pilot program to implement or strengthen preexisting communication skills. the focus is creating an environment where personnel can seek support from their external support system without concern over judgement or lack of understanding. Armenian hamsters are preferred species for monoclonal antibody generation. majority of hamsters used in research consist of Syrian hamsters. most literature and published procedural techniques are based around Syrian hamster anatomy and temperament. our veterinarian, training manager, and technicians keep up-to-date on current literature and emerging techniques to provide the proper care to this infrequently used and little known species. CCHF is a tick-borne Nairovirus causing hemorrhagic fever in humans. tortoise housing must contain, and aid with tracking of, free-feeding ticks infected with CCHFV. despite these challenges, we successfully created appropriate housing by modifying standard guinea pig tubs and bedding. the peafowl are fed Purina Layena crumbles, which they work for during the week in an auditory test chamber. the animals are weighed daily while on test, and this feeding regimen allows them to maintain a healthy body weight. this method of laboratory housing has maintained peafowl health. study examined cagemate- and stranger-grouped mice exposed to 10%, 30%, or 50% v/min CO2. video of adult male C57BL/6J mice exposed to different CO2 flow rates was scored for durations of dyspnea, ataxia, and consciousness. blood was collected at time of unconsciousness and assayed for ACTH. neonatal immune system has several differences compared to that of adults. it is known that cord blood monocytes secrete decreased levels of mature IL-1 compared to adult monocytes. newborn humans and mice display increased nitric oxide (NO) levels. the protective effect of iNOS inhibition during NMEC infection was lost when pups were also treated with anti-IL-1R antibody (n=11/group) this suggests that the protective effect of nitric oxide inhibition during NMEC infection is due to improved IL-1 signaling, and may indicate a target for future therapeutics. a cohort of these mice (n=3) were infected with HIV-1 and monitored for plasma HIV viremia and CD4 T cell depletion. as a control, the NSG mice (n=6) were used to compare the TKO mice. uninfected female 5-9-wk-old Stat1 KO mice were IP administered either isotype IgG (10 g/mouse) or GCSF (0.5 g/mouse) daily for 7 days to induce granulopoiesis. daily IP administration of GCSF caused a significant depletion of pre-B/immature and mature B cells (2.2 fold and 2.4 fold respectively) in the BM. conditional disruption of Hematopoietic protein1 (Hem-1) is a hematopoietic cell-specific subunit of WAVE (WASP-family verprolin homologous protein) complex. it acts downstream immune receptors (including BCR, TCR, TLR, and cytokine receptors) to stimulate filamentous actin polymerization. neutrophils from Nckap1lfl/flLyzMCre mice exhibited defective F-actin polymerization and impaired migration in response to the chemoattractant 1 M fMLP or LTB4. nckap1lfl/flLyzMCre mice were much more susceptible to 10 PFU influenza virus (H1N1/PR8) infection based on significantly increased body weight loss. mice are severely immunodeficient, characterized by reduced B and T cells, impaired neutrophil migration and phagocytic abilities. we used the Cre-LoxP system to generate mice that were conditionally deleted for Nckapl1 in a B cell specific manner. we hypothesized that Hem-1 is important in B cell development, B cell migration, and antibody production. mutations in Nckap1l could be the cause of some undefined PIDs in humans. we predict that mutations in Nckap1l could be the cause of some undefined PIDs in humans. lorimetry and measurement of mouse activity were performed simultaneously. mice were euthanized and lungs harvested. IAV infection induced severe hypoxemia and pulmonary edema at 6 dpi. to reduce the number of mice prematurely removed from an experiment, we assessed the use of a nutritional gel (NG) supplement that is palatable and provides hydration, calories/carbohydrates, and electrolytes. both male and female C57Bl6/J mice were infected with mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34 virus at low (0.2 times the lethal dose 50 (LD50), medium (0.5 LD50; SOC n=30, NG n=27 the sooty mangabey (SM) is a natural host of simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as they maintain high viral loads and avoid progression to acquired immune disease syndrome (AIDS) and SIV in rhesus macaques (RhMs) the natural host would show evidence of a beneficial shift of microbiota with SIV infection allowing them to prevent disease progression. with chronic SIV infection in SMs, no statistically relevant changes were found (p 0.05) with chronic SIV infection in SMs, no statistically relevant changes were found. german-origin (GO) marmoset samples were collected at three time points. GO samples showed greater phylogenetic diversity and less species evenness. a greater shift in GO samples suggested a role of diet in shaping the gut microbiota. coccidia (systemic isosporosis, also known an atoxoplasmosis) is a common parasitic disease of passerine birds. the time between arrival and onset of clinical signs ranged from 2 d to 2 mo. postoperative complications, specifically surgical site edema and dehiscence, occurred on d 6 in the forelimbs of both animals. the dehiscence in the second sheep was treated with standard wound management, analgesia, and preemptive antibiotics. both sheep achieved complete resolution of their forelimb complications within 4 weeks post-debridement. despite the pronounced foreign body reaction witnessed in these two cases, all hindlimbs of the seven sheep healed normally after the engraftment procedure. all rabbits were given a sustained release opioid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesic. a postoperative schedule was created to perform assessments and care every 8 h. the rabbits handled the recovery process differently, behaviorally and physically. glactin 910 was elected due to its low memory, ease of handling, and knot security. biopsy results from the site indicated a suture-related pseudoinfection. postmortem necropsy definitively demonstrated a suture-related pseudoinfection. 9 of 24 birds were reported for multiple, tan, proliferative, 2.0mm-3.0mm masses on 1 or more digits. a female bird developed 5 3.0mm-5.0mm masses on multiple digits. this bird was euthanized and submitted for postmortem examination. a 12-y-old castrated male DLH cat presented with multiple dry lacerations measuring 3mm to 1cm on the caudal abdomen. the cat failed to respond to systemic amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and topical chlorhexidine soaks. within 2 wk, additional lesions, some with purulent discharge, were present. mycobacterium genome has not been reported as a cause of feline atypical mycobacterial panniculitis, nor has it been reported as a zoonotic agent. observational learning facilitates positive reinforcement training in macaques (Macaca mulatta) 6 of the observers reliably presented, none of the nonobservers learned this task. infants whose mothers were trained learned this task sooner than other infants (P 0.01). these results suggest that observational learning may facilitate PRT for inhibited monkeys. the IACUC can be instrumental in encouraging investigators to consider the role that positive reinforcement training can play in their research. the IACUC can be instrumental in encouraging investigators to consider the role that positive reinforcement training can play in their research. computer-based training can be set up remotely, allowing 1 person to train multiple animals at a time. an accessible user interface which allows trainer to move the animal through each approximation with minimal interruption can help create that kind of seamless experience. monkeys are often restrained in open restraint chairs (ORC) using the pole and collar technique. a closed box chair (CBC) is a clear, plexiglass box in which the monkey is trained to sit. the technique reduces stress on the animals, while enhancing the quality and quantity of sperm samples. positive reinforcement training is applied across the globe with nonhuman primates in the laboratory animal science environment. benefits include increased cooperation with husbandry, clinical, and research procedures, increased welfare, decreased stress and fear, decreased time to conduct procedures once training is complete, and increased safety for animals and personnel. chimpanzees using behavioral management programs to establish personalized care routines are a valuable tool for the care and wellbeing of the animals. Personalized therapy and exercise routines, including squats, standing, finger and toe extensions, weight shifts, and climbing were created for 9 chimpanzees. each chimpanzee\u2019s mobility rating and progress are assessed. positive reinforcement training (PRT) is used to enhance the welfare of NHPs in many ways. training the animals to participate in their own veterinary care decreases stress. nonhuman primates have also been trained to urinate on demand. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were trained using mixed reinforcement training. rhesus macaques learned faster than cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) there are 27 individual units, each housing up to 11 females. they are trained to come to a holding cage for swabs before being released into the main unit. the animals are trained to enter via the back of the cage. remote data was recorded for 2 h before, during, and after physical restraint for 6 h in total. animals were placed in an infusion chair on 5 consecutive d for 2 h and once again on d 8, following 2 d rest. exposure of pigmented and non-pigmented rats to light at night suppresses nighttime pineal circadian melatonin production. exposure of rats to blue-enriched (465-485 nm) LED light at daytime (bLAD) revealed a marked positive effect on neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral parameters. daytime exposure of mice to bLAD, compared to LAN, has a profound positive impact on circadian regulation of metabolism. light entrains the master biological clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which regulates the nocturnal pineal melatonin signal. mice housed under 12:12-h light:dark cycle in CWF light. C3H mice in bLAD evinced a 6-fold higher peak nighttime plasma melatonin level. mice were monitored every three days for dietary/water intake, body weight, and feed conversion efficiency. mice were measured every three days for dietary/water intake, body weight, and feed conversion efficiency. day light exposure period blood was collected over one week at 6 circadian time points to obtain blood chemistries and complete blood counts. there were no differences in light duration or within cage light intensities (illuminance/irradiance) between bLAD and CWF (32.25 1.88 ; 78.80 1.88 W/cm2) groups. uM mice were injected with the labelled human T cells. there were 3 mice in each group. whole body FMT imaging was performed to evaluate the trafficking. an in vitro project was performed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 antibiotics on 15 novel mouse-C. bovis isolates from across the country. an infectious dose of C. bovis was applied to 2 of 3 groups (n = 4-5/group) of singly housed, athymic nude (n = 15) and NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG, n prophylactic antibiotics can be used to prevent C. bovis infections. some strains of Kp exhibit antibiotic resistance and hypermucoviscosity. plasmid-encoded class 1 integron harboring antibiotic resistance genes for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfonamide was identified in 12/13 genomes. all genomes also contained resistance genes for beta-lactams and fosfomycin. the role of the gut microbiome in health remains a significant area of research for many investigators. changes in the gut microbiota can have a major role in driving experimental variability. a group of 12 mice associated with gut microbiota were housed and bred for two subsequent generations. new viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and can alter the physiology of infected cells and communication or interaction with other cell types. it is imperative to have a rapid and comprehensive screening of virus in research rodent colonies to know the variables that may influence data obtained during biological investigations. nephropathy spontaneously occurs in mice. chronic tubulointestitial nephropathy and kidney fibrosis in mice. dinucleotide deletion at nucleotide 495 compared to the MKPV genome from MKSCC and IC. deletion is located immediately downstream of the coding region of NS2-P. PCR and qPCR assays using designed primers conserved among the known MKPV genome sequences were established. the subgross examination of pelts may not efficiently and accurately demonstrate the status of ectoparasite infestations in laboratory animals using the IVC system. in 15 rodent colonies, the multiplex PCR assay has successfully detected the dual or triple natural infestations of fur mites in 17 of 48 rodents by fur swabs and in 10 out of 25 rodent cages by cage swabs. we have developed a minimally invasive, morphology independent solution for subcutaneous tumor measurement using 3D imaging, thermography, and AI. our platform captures integrated tumor volume from the 3D surface as well as 3D morphological and thermal features. we will demonstrate the extent of calliper measurement inconsistencies from a dataset of 2,500 tumor volume measurements from 1,600 mice. the animals involved in xenotransplantation are not specifically described under the AWA but addressed under the FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry\u201d documents instead. current animal protection laws other than the AWA vary from state to state, while animal welfare monitoring for livestock production relies heavily on voluntary audits. clinical signs of infection include emaciation, spinal deformities, reduced growth, altered behavior, gdecreased fecundity, and increased mortality. no treatment is currently available for microsporidiosis, making its exclusion from laboratory animal facilities challenging. environmental enrichment (EE) is another factor which may affect behavior and reproduction in adult AB strain zebrafish. fish housed with EE had more averaged entries (13.97) into the top of the test tank than fish housed without EE (8.04) no statistical differences were found for LDT. SPF fish produced, on average, more eggs (17.49) than infected fish (4.47 and 1.06 respectively) this exampler resulted in a box savings of over 19 boxes, a decrease in overall costs of over $1,000, and a savings of 138 mice. genetic drift and the impact and number of potential mutations that occur over multiple rounds of in house breeding without genetic control is also a factor. a reputable vendor enables principal investigators to obtain animals of the correct age, strain, and sex. veterinary hospice and in-home euthanasia is one of the fastest growing specialties in veterinary medicine. hospice veterinarians focus on appropriate pain management, palliation of symptoms at the end of life, humane euthanasia, and grief support for the owners. the Welfare and Wellness ASLAP Group (WWAG) was created to maximize the positive human-animal interaction opportunities within our institution\u2019s robust environmental enrichment program. the initiative provided practical hands-on experience for laboratory animal career-focused students. home cage behavior was evaluated in 3 strains: SJL/JOrlCrl (high aggression), C57BL/6NCrl (moderate aggression) and A/JCr (low aggression; n = 8/strain; 24 cages*5 mice/cage =120 mice) aggression had a negative relationship with nest and sweat odors. odors in nesting material and sweat correlate with low aggression and high affiliative behaviors. odors in nesting material and sweat correlate with low aggression and high affiliative behaviors. 5.6%), while chronic pain research with mice was most supported (63.6%). participants provided open-ended comments, showing that an online forum can also provide qualitative feedback on research protocols. results illustrate the type of public input that can emerge. mice of both sexes and four strains (C57Bl/6, FVB/n, DBA/2, and BALB/c, total n=38) were restrained by 3 different restraint methods. a standard immobilizing scruff designed to draw the forelimbs back, prevent head movement, and create a crease on the ventral neck as a consequence of a longitudinal fold of skin. BRAD promotes peer education about animal research, offers a platform for those working with or supporting animals to discuss their work with animals. the event also serves as a pipeline for future careers in biomedical research and laboratory animal care and medicine. canine lumbar and cervical IVDs were collected aseptically after euthanasia for reasons unrelated to this study. human IVD tissues were cultured for 3 d and media collected at the end of culture period. acupuncture is a traditional Chinese practice for pain alleviation that involves insertion of thin needles into the skin and underlying tissue followed by manual manipulation or electrical stimulation. but the efficacy of acupuncture in managing osteoarthritis is uncertain, as much of the evidence is of questionable quality. electroacupuncture is a nonpharmacological therapeutic technique that has been shown to have a clinically relevant effect on chronic pain. a 3-week period of electroacupuncture had a positive effect on symptom, but not disease, modification in a rodent model of osteoarthritis. a total of 24 rats (CRL:SD) were divided in 3 groups: 1) no TBI/no EA, 2) TBI/no EA and, 3) TBI/EA. treatment was started 30 min after cTBI as preemptive acute treatments. chronic pain can drastically impair an individual\u2019s quality of life due to alterations in limb function and therefore mobility. most marketed instruments assess rodents at an abnormal incline or during locomotion. 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine SC could not reduce pain scores after orthopedic surgery. 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine SC could be used to compensate for a lower F. AUC was significantly lower for SC 0.05 than: (i) IV in females (423 148 and 725 211 g/L*min, P = 0.003) but not males (423 149 and 530 163 g/L*min, P = 0.086), (ii) IM in females (773 185 g/L*min, P = 0.004) but not males (634 141 g/L*min, P = 0.026), (i in the early days of primate research, manual/physical restraint was used. chemical immobilization with ketamine or other anesthetics became the most commonly used method. elimination of anesthesia reduces risks to the animal. pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases involves genetic defects in specific cell populations within the brain. a major challenge for gene therapy research aimed at correcting these defects is developing methods capable of delivering therapeutic genetic material to cells most affected by the disease process being studied. cuprizone mouse model is used to study de/remyelination associated with motor deficits. results from standard behavioral assays are highly variable with reports of open field activity that is increased or decreased. continuous monitoring showed that different conditions throughout the study, such as time of day or procedure, interact with the cuprizone treatment to produce different behavioral outcomes. results highlight the utility of continuous collection of undisturbed behavior for better characterization of motor abnormalities in disease models. Iso+CO2 rats were transferred to a charged CO2 chamber for euthanasia. MAP, ECG, and GLU were continuously acquired prior to gas exposure through death. MAP increased in both the CO2exp and Iso+CO2 groups. cardiovascular disease strains (C57BL/6J mice with Apoe or Ldlr mutations) and diabetes models with inactive leptin (Lepob) and a C57BLKS/J strain with sustained hyperglycemia (BKS-db) on a standard chow diet, serum cholesterol measured on chemistry analyzer was higher at 8 wk in Apoe-null males. 40 of each) were at 8 wk in B6-db (males were 1.7 g more; P = 0.0037) and 16 wk in B6-ob (females were 2.5 g more; P = 0.0017). db/db males had higher blood glucose than females (415 vs 357 mg/dL; P 0.0001) at 8 wk. bred inhouse for approximately 20 y and have routinely tested negative for common rodent pathogens. the differential diagnosis list included neoplasia, hematoma, or abscess. on neurologic exam, there was moderate kyphosis and decreased weight bearing in all limbs. the mouse generally remained in a sitting position with hindlimbs splayed. withdrawal reflexes were decreased, and hindlimb splay reflexes were absent. the hindlimbs appeared mildly erythemic. a 14-y-old male research white carneau pigeon used in psychology studies was assessed for a soft tissue mass on the right ventral neck near the crop. two months prior, a mass suspected to be a feather follicle cyst 1cm in diameter was noted at the same location. a portion of the mass was pecked and removed by the pigeon. is and subcutis were expanded by a well-demarcated, nonencapsulated, densely cellular mass. cells formed variably sized nodules surrounding dilated veins, arteries, and cystic cavitations. neoplastic cells exhibited moderate to marked atypia and 91 mitotic figures per 10 HPFs. two morbid animals were euthanized for detailed necropsy. the skin of the dorsum on both mice was slightly depressed and irregular. intact male rabbit found dead in its cage 3 d after treatment of minor skin lacerations suspected to be fight wounds. lupus erythematosus is associated with autoimmune disease including systemic lupus erythematosus. sudden death in transgenic animals can act as a sentinel event. biopsy of unusual skin lesions, complete tissue collection from animals found dead, and assessment of serum autoimmune antibodies will be useful in following this colony. the marmoset recovered well after the second surgery, but the distal tail and left foot became necrotic over the next several days. the cause of morbidity in this patient was likely multifactorial. clinical chemistry revealed elevation of leakage and induced liver enzymes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. the liver also had evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the gallbladder, lung, pancreas, ovaries, uterus, mesenteric, and peri-pancreatic lymph nodes. microCT revealed an intraabdominal hyperdense fetiform structure in the region of the palpated mass. Differential diagnoses included teratoma, ectopic pregnancy, or fetus in fetu. acute presentation appeared due to severe rhinitis and necrotizing laryngotracheitis with mixed gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the animal had severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the clinical presentation did not appear to be due to acute cardiac decompensation. a cohort of 20 adult male and female STAT2 knockout Syrian hamsters was imported from another academic institution. 6 hamsters presented with multiple swellings on the face and/or legs or with poor body condition and an enlarged abdomen with a firm, palpable mass. the animals were euthanized and necropsies were performed. a diagnosis of transmissible lymphoma induced by hamster polyomavirus (HaPyV) was made based on prior pathogen surveillance testing at the sending institution, clinical presentation, and gross and histologic evaluation. the study focused on the need for understanding principles of human behavior change to improve animal welfare. current rodent housing standards and speciesism were identified as the primary reasons for current welfare issues. most interviewees remain optimistic that it is possible to move beyond these limitations. the survey supports the existence of cognitive dissonance associated with laboratory animal medicine. the study supports the existence of cognitive dissonance associated with laboratory animal medicine. the training program was developed for a large commercial institution. it includes use of best practice sharing amongst facilities, creation of a training guidebook for 2 types of housing environments, as well as program implementation and assessment. it is widely acknowledged that good quality science goes hand in hand with good welfare. the RSPCA, as a scientific animal welfare organization, has managed to improve implementation of the 3Rs. we highlight how the scientific community has managed to improve implementation of the 3Rs. a range of resources that we have produced will be presented. the compliance unit standard procedure (CUSP) project offers an option to address administrative burden at the institutional level. a working group representing over 40 institutions has been formed to support site design and development. target training encourages animals to step onto a scale to be weighed, stand still while being examined or data is being collected, return to their kennel, and walk on a treadmill. refinements have decreased behavioral signs of stress in the animals when they\u2019re being handled. webpage was created by the IACUC office in an effort to establish a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for new PIs. it provides relevant information on topics such as accessing the electronic protocol management system, writing an animal protocol, completing required training, and obtaining animal facility access. meeting the new PI in person allows for customized discussion and the ability to answer questions about their specific research needs. 802 laboratory animal personnel completed an online survey about professional quality of life, social support, euthanasia, stress/pain levels. higher self-reported levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress were associated with less social support, enrichment provision, and control over euthanasia. scores from 3 domains were compared between individuals who euthanized animals and those who did not using a 2-sample t-test. there was no difference (P = 0.10) in the compassion satisfaction T score between those who euthanized animals (mean 49.6, SD 10.0) and those who did not (mean 51.7, SD 10.1). we will analyze our survey data further to determine whether factors such as years of employment, animal species, or method of euthanasia are associated with feelings of burnout and traumatic stress. this information may be used to inform targeted interventions to mitigate these aspects of compassion fatigue. after immunization with NP-Ficoll, MNV-4 infected Stat1 knockout mice had an average OD value of 1.04 compared to uninfected Stat1 knockout mice with an average OD value of 0.36. the significant depletion of B cells in the bone marrow does not result in a significant difference (P > 0.05) in serum IgG levels compared to uninfected mice immunized to either KLH or NP-Ficol only malathion, on occasion, exceeded its minimum detectable concentration (.01 ppm) since 1990 14 of the pesticides listed for certified diets have been banned from use. nonhuman primate staff received training from the nonhuman primate enrichment and behavior group on how to use the clicker and recognize positive versus negative behavior traits. initial subjective feedback from the husbandry, veterinary, and enrichment staff reported favorable results. the use of finger paints as a novel intervention would lead to a reduction of FS in NHPs. observations were made 6 h, 24 h, 7 d, and 14 d after cage change for individuals exhibiting FS (n=7) breeding success was determined by analyzing litter size, pup weights, and litter mortality. we scored the cage condition, animal appearance, and animal behavior every 2 wk. no significant difference in breeding efficiency between groups. relative humidity, humidity, and humidity were collected in both caging systems. traditional cages displayed low ammonia throughout the cage-change cycle. the novel cages saw ammonia increase on day 5 but remain under 25 ppm by day 7 of the cage change. male or female mice were housed at 1, 3, or 5 per cage in static or IVC cages in 2 rooms maintained at 12h:12h light:dark cycles. data loggers in cage lids, rooms, and outside the building provided hourly T and RH readings. 19 cases reported in a 6-mo window versus our typical annual caseload of 1-2 cases. two factors potentially contributing to the increase included a new staff member and the introduction of Staphylococcus xylosus. bioexclusionary containment structure prevents efficient and successful outcome for the many coordinated parts of the biological derivation process. the historical approach to germfree isolator work relies on large quantities of toxic chemicals to clean up the macroenvironment and facilitate the success of isolator port entry of materials and supplies. lab animal technicians are bound by the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide, the IACUC and our own morality to mitigate unnecessary stress to the animals under our care. the team used signs consisting of 1 colored shape designated for each procedure type: husbandry/enrichment (blue circle), invasive procedures (red triangle), or status quo (green square) a 2-year-old, intact female tree shrew presented for mild periocular dermatitis. a fluctuant, subcutaneous, 1.5cm x 1.0cm mass at her second left abdominal mamma, centered underneath the nipple was identified. a fine needle aspirate was taken of the mass revealing a uniform population of neoplastic epithelial cells. radiographs showed no evidence of metastasis and FNA of cranial mammae/lymph nodes showed no evidence of neoplasia. Surgical mastectomy should be considered in cases of mammary carcinoma. thropoietin (150 IU/kg IM), iron dextran (10mg/kg IM), ad lib carnivore care (6.4 tbsp dry/kg PO) and daily polyvit (0.5mL PO) for 4 d. the macaque was dyspneic with pale blue mucus membranes. complete blood count and biochemistry were unremarkable. fluoroscopy evaluation revealed restricted inflation of lungs and a large, round, stationary cardiac silhouette. euthanasia was elected. a 30-d-old male chimera mouse was examined for 2 discrete swellings. the proximal swelling was located at the tail base, with a narrowed circumferential area of apparent constriction caudally. the area of annular constriction was immediately followed by a second, more distal, fusiform shaped lesion with mild, dark blue to black subcutaneous discoloration. teratomas are most commonly described in the reproductive organs of animals. the literature describes induced teratomas as a model for assessing pluripotency and tumorigenesis. however, spontaneous teratomas are seen more often in younger animals. a cesium irradiator and C57BL/6J recipient strain were used. the affected mice were euthanized, and 2 were submitted for necropsy. a 19-y-old female rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) was examined for an abdominal mass. radiographs and ultrasound revealed a thick-walled, fluid-filled mass in the caudal abdomen and increased soft tissue opacity in the left caudal lung fields. differentials for the mass included endometriosis, neoplasia, ovarian cyst, and possible hematoma. endometriosis in rhesus macaques is a rare presentation for a well-known disease. left undiagnosed, endometriosis in rhesus macaques can lead to various complications. an 8 percent decrease in body weight was noted. no choleliths were seen and the liver appeared of normal size and echogenicity. only 6 cases of gallbladder adenocarcinoma have been reported. a 13-y-old, 4.5 kg male castrated domestic shorthair cat on a vitamin D supplementation study presented with episodic syncope and signs consistent with cardiogenic shock. the cat returned to his normal housing, vitamin D2 supplementation was discontinued, and continuous video monitoring was installed inside of the room. hepatomegaly has remained stable with no apparent cardiogenic deficits. enlarged, soft mammae of normal color and temperature. enlarged, soft mammae of normal color. the ultimate cause of hepatic lipidosis in this nonanorectic rabbit remains unknown, but prolonged lactation may have been a precipitating factor. Previously reported causes of leporine galactorrhea, including prolactinoma, were ruled out by these findings. animal, part of a cohort in a study investigating the influence of inflammation on breast cancer development and progression, had been provided a purified high fat diet (AIN-93) ad libitum since arrival from the vendor 2 wk earlier. differential diagnoses included idiopathic necrotizing arteritis, bacterial otitis media/interna (Pasteurella pneumotropica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a 9-year-old female Xenopus laevis was reported for a white growth on its left leg. on physical exam, the frog was quiet and had a white, cotton-like mass on the left tarsus. both eyes had white corneal opacities that were easily irritated and bled freely. hypovitaminosis K in mice due to dietary insufficiency combined with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. mice were fed a chemically defined amino acid diet with menadione as the form of vitamin K. hypovitaminosis K was confirmed as no additional morbidity was noted following treatment with 100 g of PK subcutaneously for 3 d and then every 3 d for 2 wk. the diet was reformulated with 1.2 mg/kg PK. a knock-in rat model harboring an ATG16L1 gene variant responsible for increased CD predisposition in humans showed shifts in the gut microbiota composition as well as CD-like histologic signs in ileal and colonic tissues of rats heterozygous for the Atg16l1 CD susceptibility variant (HET) the results indicate that rats harboring the Atg16l1 variant causing increased CD predisposition in humans are more sensitive than males. 405nm \u201ctrue violet\u201d light has been shown to kill multiple clinically relevant bacterial species in vitro while leaving mammalian cells unscathed. we tested in vitro efficacy against a clinical bacterial isolate. mice were observed daily until euthanasia at 1, 3 or 21 days postsurgery. the selected doses caused neither behavioral changes postoperatively, as measured by cageside observation for pain behaviors or neurologic abnormalities. a subset of fresh embryos were immediately cultured to assess their developmental potential to blastocyst stage. the percentage of fresh embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage from either AIS or PMSG were not different (p>0.05) DR is the most common neurovascular complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 140 million diabetics worldwide. current treatment options, including laser vitrectomy and anti-VEGF agents, are only used for advanced DR. a sustained release, insulin-loaded, biodegradable nanogel system was developed to target the neuronal degeneration in DR. a-wave and oscillatory potential amplitudes were significantly increased two weeks after treatment with the nanogels compared with one day before treatment. these results suggest that the insulin-loaded nanogels improved photoreceptor and amacrine cell function in diabetic rats and can be potentially developed as a long-acting therapy. ID mice were injected subcutaneously with an analgesic (carprofen 5 mg/kg or buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline 0.1 ml) at the time of intratibial injection with PCa cell lines. neither carprofen or buprenorphine administration affected tumor growth, behavioral or clinical parameters compared to the saline control for either cell line. BALB/cJ (n=37) and NU/J (n=34) mice were given a single IP dose of ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg or etomidate 20 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg. Surgical depth was confirmed by a negative pedal withdraw response to both manual finger pinch and regulated forceps pinch. a new Zealand white Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) Model AJ Osborne*1, K Balogh2, S Brendle2, J Hu2, C Sample3, ND Christensen2 1Comparative Medicine, Penn State Hershey, Harrisburg, PA; 2Pathology, Penn State Hershey, Hershey, PA Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpesvirus that infects over 90% of rabbits reached humane endpoints despite veterinary supportive care. qPCR analysis of spleen cells proved more diagnostic than PBLs. anti-CD4 rabbits were strongly positive for EBV within splenic cells. indwelling epidural catheterization in conscious swine is feasible and safe for a period of at least 2 wk. swine offer a robust platform to test tolerability of novel agents intended for use in the awake patient. swine were premedicated with intramuscular midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, butorphanol 0.3 mg/kg and xylazine 4 mg/kg. all swine received intravenous buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg prior to surgery. at the start of the lab, isoflurane was discontinued. a series of 10 purpose-bred laboratory mice with pancreatic cystic lesions are characterized by dilated spaces surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule often accompanied by early fibroplasia and/or edema (7/10). acinar atrophy (6/10) and hemosiderin-laden macrophages were characterized by varying degrees of pancreatic acinar atrophy (6/10) and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. four of 10 animals were from the following strains: NOD/ShiLtJ [NOD], NOD.CB17-Pkrdcscid>/J [NOD scid], NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid> Il2rgtm1Wjl> Tg(CMV-IL3,CSF2,KITLG) and BTBR.V(B6)Lepob>/WiscJ [BTBR obese] and C a 2-incision method was used, incising over each testicle in the scrotum. mice were administered meloxicam at 2 mg/kg once every 24 h. enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously for at least 2 more d. the IL10/ mouse is used as a model to study inflammatory bowel disease. an optimal phenotype requires postweaning oral gavage with Helicobacter hepaticus. the increase in disease severity of the control mice was contributed to contamination with H. hepaticus in the colony breeders and stock animals. the colony was reestablished, and routine screening of mice was implemented. this occurrence stresses the importance of pre-inoculation screening. livers had severe macro- and micro-vesicular hepatic lipidosis. the white matter at the levels of the hippocampus and cerebellum in this mouse exhibited multifocal areas of spongiosis with mild laminar neuronal loss, and astrocytosis with Alzheimer type II cells. mice were infected with H. pylori (SS1) and fed a chemically defined amino acid diet containing 2 mg folate/kg. mice that received the eradication therapy became lethargic and appeared scruffy, hunched, and pale within 4 d. starting at 19 WPI, 41% of the mice that were given antibiotics were found dead or moribund. the source of vitamin K added to both the 2 and 8 mg/kg folate diet was 0.5 mg menadione sodium bisulfite (MD) per kg of feed. previous studies question the bioavailability and optimal feed concentration of menadione in animal feed. the rate of UTI was 16.7% in the cystectomy group, 67% in the ileocystoplasty group, 33.3% in the commercial biomaterial group, and 33.3% in the experimental biomaterial group. the predominant bacteria isolated were Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, and Aerococcus sanguinicola further evaluation revealed poor dentition with significant gingival recession and pytalism. diagnostics included CBC, serum chemistry, and pharyngeal culture. no significant findings were noted on bloodwork. this is the first report of thyroid follicular carcinoma in a common marmoset. this case highlights the need for anatomical description and imaging assessment of normal structures in the common marmoset. the animal was started on antiviral (galvancyclovir 13mg/kg), antiinflammatory (prednisone 1mg/kg), antimicrobial (ceftiofur 20mg/kg), and gastroprotectant (famotidine 0.5mg/kg) therapy. additional diagnostics included standard NHP serology panel (Herpes B, SRV, SIV, STLV), SV-40 serology, flavivirus serology panel (Dengue, West female, uniparous africa green monkey was diagnosed with her second pregnancy. ultrasound showed a fetus with a heart rate of 160 beats per minute. an intact amniotic sac measuring 18mm in diameter was surrounded by echogenic fluid within the placenta. work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are reported by the oSHA as the \u201cmost widespread occupational health hazard facing our nation today\u201d many workplace injuries can be prevented by proactively identifying jobs or tasks with a higher injury risk. over a period of 2 y, we have seen a 38% reduction in the total number of injuries reported and a 34.8% reduction in the number of injuries categorized as WMSDs. we highlight changes made to our system of injury reporting while using case-based examples to illustrate how we obtained, analyzed, and used injury reporting data. ROI is estimated to be 10.0 for the whole site with a potential cost avoidance of up to $102,059 for the department. the administration of chemicals to research animals is continually increasing and evolving. the recommended safety procedures may be unintentionally inaccurate or incomplete, putting both lab and animal care staff at risk. lab animal, IAUCU, veterinary, and EHS professionals can take the information back to their institution to help streamline their review process and improve safety for those working with animals exposed to hazardous chemicals. the department created the Compassion Awareness Project, which works internally to prevent, reduce and mitigate the negative effects of compassion fatigue on laboratory animal personnel. a group of recently received NHPs did not show much interest in the usual enrichment activities our department has used in the past. this has made an imaginative environment for technicians who get to come up with innovative ways of presenting food enrichments. the majority of hamsters used in research consist of Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) most literature and published procedural techniques are based on Syrian hamster anatomy and temperament. this posed a unique challenge when researchers requested the use of Armenian hamsters (Cricetulus migratorius) PS47 Withdrawn PS48 Development of Greek tortoises and Hyalomma aegyptium Tick Feeding Model at BSL-4 to study the transmission of CCHF virus in nature. CCHF is a tick-borne Nairovirus causing hemorrhagic fever in humans, and is a select agent that must be maintained at the biosafety level-4. a peacock\u2019s train produces infrasound that is thought to be used in social signaling. a peacock\u2019s train produces infrasound that is thought to be used in social signaling. a peacock\u2019s train produces infrasound that is thought to be used in social signaling. the peafowl are fed Purina Layena crumbles, which they work for during the week in an auditory test chamber. on weekends, the animals are provided free access to the food for 40 min each day. this feeding regimen allows them to maintain a healthy body weight. blood was collected at time of unconsciousness and assayed for ACTH. cagemates experienced significantly longer durations of conscious dyspnea and ataxia with 10% v/min CO2 compared with 30% and 50% v/min. tal immune system has several differences compared to that of adults. it is known that cord blood monocytes secrete decreased levels of mature IL-1 compared to adult monocytes in response to stimulation with bacterial products. newborn humans and mice display increased nitric oxide levels. the protective effect of nitric oxide inhibition during NMEC infection is due to improved IL-1 signaling. this suggests that the protective effect of nitric oxide inhibition during NMEC infection is due to improved IL-1 signaling, and may indicate a target for future therapeutics. the hu-PBMC mouse model supports humanization and HIV-1 infection. the model supports engraft of human immune cells: CD3, CD4 and CD8 T cells. fected female 5-9-wk-old Stat1 KO mice were IP administered either isotype IgG (10 g/mouse) or GCSF (0.5 g/mouse) daily for 7 days to induce granulopoiesis. daily IP administration of GCSF caused a significant depletion of pre-B/immature and mature B cells (2.2 fold and 2.4 fold, respectively) in the BM. hematopoietic protein1 (Hem-1) is a hematopoietic cell-specific subunit of WAVE (WASP-family verprolin homologous protein) complex. it acts downstream immune receptors to stimulate filamentous actin (F-actin) polymerization. inactivating mutations in NCKAP1L have been recently associated with primary immunodeficiency disease in humans. nckap1lfl/flLyzMCre mice were much more susceptible to 10 PFU influenza virus (H1N1/PR8) infection based on significantly increased body weight loss, increased peribronchial inflammation, reduced neutrophil and interstitial macrophage numbers, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. mice are severely immunodeficient, characterized by reduced B and T cells, impaired neutrophil migration and phagocytic abilities. we hypothesized that Hem-1 is important in B cell development, B cell migration, and antibody production in a B cell specific manner. despite availability of vaccines and antiviral drugs, seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) epidemics cause >300,000 deaths/year worldwide. IAV infection alters lung epithelial cell metabolism. IAV infection induced severe hypoxemia and pulmonary edema at 6 dpi. there was a significant decline in nocturnal activity and a decrease in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), indicating a shift towards increased lipid catabolism for ATP generation. both male and female C57Bl6/J mice were infected with mouse-adapted influenza virus at low (0.2 times the lethal dose 50 (LD50); SOC n=21, NG n=20, medium (0.5 LD50; SOC n=30, NG n=27), or high doses (1.25 LD50; SOC n=23, NG n=22) the sooty mangabey (SM) is a natural host of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) they maintain high viral loads and avoid progression to acquired immune disease syndrome (AIDS), which is unlike HIV in humans, and SIV in rhesus macaques (RhMs) the gastrointestinal environment and mucosal immunity play a strong role in determining disease outcome. s ribosome-based taxonomic characterization was performed by amplification of the V4 hypervariable region. with chronic SIV infection in SMs, no statistically relevant changes were found (p 0.05) for Shannon diversity. GO samples showed greater phylogenetic diversity and less species evenness. evenness increased and richness decreased in GO samples at 100 d, but rebounded to baseline at 1 y. a greater shift in GO samples suggested a role of diet in shaping the gut microbiota. twenty-one european starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were caught in California in 2016. the time between arrival and onset of clinical signs ranged from 2 d to 2 mo. signs included anorexia, dropping food, neurologic deficits, conjunctivitis, and sudden death. two of seven 2-year-old, female Dorset sheep (Ovis aries) on a nerve regeneration study received 7-cm-long bioengineered grafts imbibed with autologous stem cells in their median (left forelimb) and sural (right hindlimb) nerves. postoperative complications, specifically surgical site edema and dehiscence, occurred on d 6 in the forelimbs of both animals. despite the pronounced foreign body reaction witnessed in these two cases, all hindlimbs of the post-surgical forelimbs healed normally after the engraftment procedure. however, all forelimbs of the post-surgical forelimbs developed some level of edema and inflammation. in these two cases, it is proposed that two separate post-surgical events acted as inciting causes for a heightened inflammatory response. a postoperative schedule was created to perform assessments and care every 8 h. food and water in shallow bowls, hay, and fresh fruits and vegetables were provided on the cage floor. all rabbits handled the recovery process differently, behaviorally and physically. postmortem necropsy showed a suture-related pseudoinfection with extrusion of suture material from the ovarian pedicle ligatures through the body wall and skin leading to numerous sterile abscesses in the flank areas. this is the first report of polyglactin 910 suture-related pseudoinfection in a veterinary patient. 1 male bird developed a severe beak malformation resulting in inability to close the beak. eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were present in mononuclear cells in the nasal and oral submucosa. a fast-growing mycobacterium was then cultured from the draining lesions and submitted for identification by whole genome sequencing (WGS) the cat mycobacterium genome was most closely related to Mycobacterium porcinum, a fast-growing mycobacterium. observational learning facilitates positive reinforcement training in macaques. despite the benefits, training can involve a large initial input of time. but not every animal learns at the same rate than exploratory animals. the process of reviewing and approving research protocols by the IACUC can be a powerful method for enhancing positive reinforcement training of monkeys assigned to research projects. some IACUC members must be familiar with animal training methods, and be aware of the types of behaviors currently being trained across the laboratory animal science field.

PRT is used to train cooperation with husbandry, clinical, and research behaviors, including teaching NHP to tolerate some restraint behaviors. benefits include increased welfare, decreased stress and fear, decreased time to conduct procedures once training is complete, and increased safety for animals and personnel. Personalized therapy and exercise routines were created for 9 chimpanzees with mobility impairments. veterinary technicians rate each chimpanzee on 6 categories of movement and mobility once per month. each chimpanzee\u2019s mobility rating and progress are assessed, and new PT targets are created or increased. nonhuman primates have been trained to urinate on demand, present for evaluation of blood glucose values, and cooperate with integrative pain-relieving therapeutics such as acupuncture and laser therapy. training opportunities improve the welfare of the animals, but also enriching for the staff. experienced trainers observed a negative association between willingness to accept a treat from the hand in primates with an inhibited temperament at colony entry. all animals completed training, learned the task, and demonstrated behaviors consistent with productive coping evidenced by voluntary approach and engagement with trainers. data collected on 44 nave females confirmed 100% compliance with animals coming forward for vaginal swabs after 21 days of positive reinforcement training. acclimatization to physical restraint procedure in an infusion chair over repeated training intervals reduced stress levels in primates. after animals were hand caught and placed in the infusion chair, glucose levels and heart rate increased in parallel as expected. while tissue glucose decreased under physical restraint back to nearly baseline within 1 h, heart rates remained elevated until the animals were released into their home cages. mice exposed to blue-enriched (465-485 nm) LED light at daytime (bLAD) showed a marked positive effect on neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral parameters. LAN disrupts, while bLAD enhances, circadian rhythms of metabolism and physiology associated with animal health and wellbeing. physiology RT Dauchy*1, DE Blask1, AE Hoffman6, S Xiang4, JP Hanifin2, B Warfield2, GC Brainard2, M Anbalagan4, LM Dupepe3, GL Dobek3, EM Dauchy5, SM Hill4 1Laboratory of Chron-Neuroendocrine Oncology, Tulane Univ School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA. light regulates the nocturnal pineal melaton wk on a common lighting regimen 12L (68.8 5.2 lux; 168.6 12.8 W/cm2 (within cage); lights on 0600 h:12D (0 lux) on either CWF (control) or bLAD (experimental) lighting. C3H mice in bLAD evinced a 6-fold higher peak nighttime plasma melatonin level. laboratory animal facilities are transitioning from conventional cool white fluorescent (CWF) lighting to light emitting diode (LED) lighting technology due to higher efficiency, cost effectiveness, and lower environmental impact. previous studies showed that the quality of light (wavelength) impacts metabolism and physiology in rodents. CWF (32.25 1.88 ; 78.80 4.80 W/cm2) and bLAD (32.25 1.88 ; 78.80 1.88 W/cm2) groups. significant differences in dietary intake and body weights (P 0.05) only in C3H male mice maintained in bLAD compared to CWF lighting. the labelled T-cells can be labeled by Cellvue815 without affecting the viability in vitro. liver and spleen as major organs for T-cell accumulation. an in vitro project was performed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 antibiotics on 15 mouse-C. bovis isolates from across the country. an infectious dose of C. bovis was applied to 2 of 3 groups (n = 4-5/group) of singly housed, athymic nude (n = 15) and NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG, n = Klebsiella pneumoniae is an intestinal bacteria that can cause septicemia, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia particularly in immunocompromised hosts. some strains of Kp exhibit antibiotic resistance and hypermucoviscosity, making infection challenging to effectively treat. plasmid-encoded class 1 integron harboring antibiotic resistance genes for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfonamide was identified in 12/13 genomes. PCR identified this integron in 20/23 additional isolates. a group of 12 mice associated with gut microbiota were housed and bred for two subsequent generations within an isolator microenvironment. a group of 12 mice associated at birth were housed and bred for two subsequent generations within an isolator microenvironment under gnotobiotic husbandry practices. PCR detection of rodent viruses is limited by available known virus genome diversity. serology can only determine viral presence based on available virus antigens for the detection of specific antiviral antibody production. RNA and DNA was isolated from fecal samples and converted to double stranded DNA. chronic tubulointestitial nephropathy spontaneously occurs in mice. chronic tubulointestitial nephropathy and kidney fibrosis in mice is linked to infection of an atypical parvovirus, termed mouse kidney parvovirus. a segment of the MKPV genome was identified in wild mice (Peromyscus leucopus) originating from Massachusetts Taken together, our data indicate that MKPV is prevalent in laboratory and wild mice. the new PCR assay provides new insights into the evolution of the MKPV genomes. multiplex PCR assay targets rRNA genes to simultaneously detect and differentiate these ectoparasites. this assay is very sensitive and specific with a detection limit of 10 copies for all target agents. the status of the parasite infestations in these animals was confirmed with pelts examination and specific PCR assays followed by DNA sequence analyses. a dataset of 2,500 tumor volume measurements shows 92% and 98% measurement agreement for length and width respectively. users can be trained eight times faster compared to callipers. a further benefit is that users can be trained eight times faster compared to callipers. animals involved in xenotransplantation are not specifically described under the AWA but addressed under the FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry\u201d documents instead. current animal protection laws other than the AWA vary from state to state. current animal protection laws other than the AWA vary from state to state. erio's growing popularity in research is the widespread prevalence of zebrafish microsporidiosis. clinical signs of infection include emaciation, spinal deformities, reduced growth, altered behavior, gdecreased fecundity, and increased mortality. environmental enrichment (EE) is another factor which may affect behavior and reproduction in adult AB strain zebrafish. more viable embryos at 6 d postfertilization (11.7) than infected fish (4.47 and 1.06 respectively), with EE in breeding tanks not resulting in a difference in reproductive outcomes. our findings support both the exclusion of P. neurophilia from laboratory zebrafish and the use of EE in housing tanks. experimental refinements, including anesthesia and peri- and postoperative analgesia protocols, humane endpoints, and euthanasia methods, were reviewed in over 500 basic and applied animal research proposals. a literature review was conducted to assemble the latest best practice approaches in regards to housing and care. animal hospice and in-home euthanasia is one of the fastest growing specialties in veterinary medicine. veterinary veterinarians focus on appropriate pain management, palliation of symptoms at the end of life, humane euthanasia, and grief support for the owners. members of the Ohio State University ASLAP Club completed a written application to assess individual goals for the program. students engaged their canine companions in leash training, forming playgroups and enhancing canine socialization with one-on-one interactions. home cage behavior was evaluated in 3 strains: SJL/JOrlCrl (high aggression), C57BL/6NCrl (moderate aggression), and A/JCr (low aggression; n = 8/strain); 24 cages*5 mice/cage =120 mice. aggression had a negative relationship with nest and sweat odors. odors in nesting material and sweat correlate with low aggression and high affiliative behaviors. odors in nesting material and sweat correlate with low aggression and high affiliative behaviors. a potential response is to make protocols publicly accessible. the use of a validated smartphone-based electrocardiogram in mice was validated. it was used by researchers to validate the use of a smartphone-based electrocardiogram in mice. this could reduce the risk that practices fall out of step with community values. this could provide a better understanding of what types of animal research people accept. three experienced mouse handlers performed the experiments. there was no difference in heart rate between the light restraint and 3-finger restraint method. the median heart rate using the immobilizing scruff was significantly decreased by 50-66%. the flexible nature of BRAD allows each event to be tailored to reach specific audiences and fit the resources and goals of any organization. we discuss how BRAD has been implemented at an institutional level, within an entire region at multiple organizations. explants were separated into 2 groups, control and cytokine stimulated (10 ng/ml IL-1) in supplemented DMEM. media were tested for inflammatory and degradative metabolites using commercially available assays. ture is a traditional Chinese practice for pain alleviation that involves insertion of thin needles into the skin and underlying tissue followed by manual manipulation or electrical stimulation. but the efficacy of acupuncture in managing osteoarthritis is uncertain, as much of the evidence is of questionable quality. a 3-week period of electroacupuncture had a positive effect on symptom, but not disease, modification in a rodent model of osteoarthritis. further investigations into mechanistic pathways that may explain the efficacy of electroacupuncture in this animal model, as well as longer term studies, are needed. animals in the TBI/EA group showed a statistically significant reduction in orofacial and somatic allodynia compared to TBI/no EA group. the goal of these studies is to enhance the opportunity for the translation of safe and effective treatments for human TBI injury-induced spasticity and pain. mice and rats with unilateral inflammatory pain induced by Capsaicin or Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA; 200 L of 1 mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis) were used to measure static weight bearing. meloxicam (1 mg/kg), an NSAID used for inflammatory pain, was administered to evaluate the ability to attenuate pain-associated weight bearing asymmetry. five female and 5 male rabbits were administered buprenorphine SC (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), IV and IM (0.05 mg/kg) in a randomized order with 2 weeks wash-out between administrations. males (423 149 and 530 163 g/L*min, P = 0.086), males (634 141 g/L*min, P = 0.026) and males (958 387, P 0.001) bioavailability significantly lower for SC 0.05 than: (i) IM in both females and males (50 20 and 95 21 %) and (ii) SC 0.1 in males (71 23 %) but not females (36 14 %) injuries associated with unsedated blood collection included those occurring during animal training and during blood collection. the risk was higher for unsedated animals (P = 0.04 by chi square analysis), but the low number of incidents makes statistical interpretation questionable. adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) are delivered to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using a frameless stereotactic device under MRI guidance. percutaneous pins stabilize the skull and a surgical drape that maintains sterility of the prepared surgical site. results from standard behavioral assays are highly variable with reports of open field activity that is increased, decreased, or normal in cuprizone-treated mice. continuous data collection allows for a more comprehensive characterization of behavioral traits. transient disturbances are detected as anomalies within a larger data set. results highlight the utility of continuous collection of undisturbed behavior for better characterization of motor abnormalities. MAP, ECG, and GLU were continuously acquired prior to gas exposure through death. MAP increased in both the CO2exp and Iso+CO2 groups when exposed to CO2 or isoflurane. MAP in the Iso+CO2 group further dropped when exposed to CO2. serum cholesterol measured on chemistry analyzer was higher at 8 wk in Apoe-null males (531 vs 470 mg/dL; P = 0.0036; n=20 per sex) but did not differ significantly by sex in Ldlr-null mice. male and female cholesterol was higher than sex-matched controls. male and female homozygotes had similar body fat despite differences in control genotypes. BKS-db/db insulin was higher relative to controls at 8 wk. db/db levels did not differ by sex (n=10 per sex) a 15-month-old female athymic nude mouse was examined for acute hindlimb lameness. on physical exam, the mouse was bright, alert, responsive, hunched, slightly dehydrated and thin. no external wounds were seen on physical examination. osteoarthrosis, osteomyelitis, myositis, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, and osteosarcoma were euthanized. the animal was euthanized and submitted for histopathology which revealed acute polyradiculoneuritis of the nerve roots and ganglia. a 14-y-old male research white carneau pigeon used in psychology studies was assessed for a soft tissue mass on the right ventral neck near the crop. two months prior, a mass suspected to be a feather follicle cyst 1cm in diameter was noted at the same location. the next day, the mass was cavitated, suggesting that a portion of it was pecked and removed by the pigeon. sized nodules surrounding dilated veins, arteries, and cystic cavitations containing necrotic debris extended to deep and lateral surgical margins. neoplastic cells showed moderate to marked atypia and 91 mitotic figures per 10 HPFs. the cause of hind limb paresis was determined to be halogen lamp-induced severe deep thermal injury with myelopathy. a 13-mo-old, pair-housed, male rabbit was found dead in its cage 3 d after treatment of minor skin lacerations suspected to be fight wounds. skin ulcerations on the ear and dorsum had been clipped and cleaned under inhalant anesthesia. different diagnoses for sudden death included adverse anesthetic/analgesic reactions, hemorrhage or infection of wounds, stress-related intestinal ileus, or glomerulonephritis due to C1Q insufficiency. two stillborn fetuses were delivered following medical intervention. radiographs and abdominal ultrasound revealed 2 remaining dead fetuses. the marmoset developed swelling, erythema, and lameness of the right leg below the stifle. the cause of morbidity in this patient was likely multifactorial. hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy and compression of the vena cava while supine during surgery may have contributed to decreased peripheral perfusion and subsequent injury to the extremities. clinical chemistry revealed elevation of leakage and induced liver enzymes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. liver also had evidence of cholangiohepatitis and coagulative necrosis. a large, oval heterogenous mass was found adhered to the margins of the left liver and abdominal wall. microscopically, the mass had a thick fibrous capsule and contained bony structures surrounding 2 skull-like structures. differential diagnoses, and prevalence in nonhuman primates will be discussed. the animal had severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) the clinical presentation did not appear to be due to acute cardiac decompensation. there was severe rhinitis and necrotizing laryngotracheitis with mixed gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 6 hamsters presented with multiple swellings on the face and/or legs or with poor body condition. the animals were euthanized and necropsies were performed. findings included exophytic growths on oral mucosa and within cheek pouches. study focused on the need for understanding principles of human behavior change to improve animal welfare. participants were recruited from the membership of CALAS and CALAM. results identified no discernible differences in response comments. cognitive dissonance in laboratory animal medicine may cause a negative emotional state, which can lead to engagement of compensation mechanisms to resolve the dissonance. 164 veterinarians and 145 veterinary technicians were asked to rate their opinions of various statements on a scale of 1-10, where the numbers represented \"strongly disagree to strongly agree\" discussions about COI impact all research due to requirements found in federal regulations, scientific journals, research contracts, grant agency guidelines, and institutional policies. the failure to disclose industry relationships in scientific manuscripts has resulted in increased media and public concern about COI. the training program was developed, including use of best practice sharing amongst facilities, creation of a training guidebook for 2 types of housing environments, as well as program implementation and assessment. the royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals believes that ending \u2018severe\u2019 suffering should be a top priority. IACUCs work to minimize harms and ensure judicious use of animals. Harm-benefit analysis (HBA) of the experiment is usually discussed during committee review. the Compliance Unit Standard Procedure (CUSP) Project offers an option to address administrative burden at the institutional level. the goal of this project is to create an online resource where institutions can share standard procedures used in animal care protocols with the broader animal welfare compliance community. these refinements have decreased behavioral signs of stress in the animals. the care staff can perform their duties in a safer and more efficient manner since the animals are better trained. the new principal investigators (PIs) require guidance in establishing their first animal protocol and understanding their responsibilities as PI. the IACUC office also arranges a meet and greet between each new PI, the IACUC chair/vice chair, and an IACUC administrator. each month, the IACUC is provided with metrics communicating the volume and type of new PIs joining the program. higher self-reported levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress were associated with less social support, enrichment provision, and control over euthanasia. higher reported levels of social support, enrichment provision, and control over euthanasia, as well as lower levels of animal stress/pain were associated with less compassion fatigue. scores from 3 domains were compared between individuals who euthanized animals and those who did not using a 2-sample t-test. the overall web survey response rate was 30.8%, with a total of 414 responses out of 1,341 surveys. a total of 273 self-reported in the survey that they euthanized animals and 73 self-reported that they did not. murine norovirus (MNV) infection significantly reduces all stages of B cell populations in the bone marrow in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) dependent manner as early as 7 d postinfection. we hypothesize that depletion of B cells in the bone marrow may cause an impaired ability to effectively produce antibodies when exposed to novel antigens. the significant depletion of B cells in the bone marrow of uninfected mice infected with MNV-4 does not result in a significant difference (P > 0.05) in serum IgG levels compared to uninfected mice immunized to either KLH or NP-Ficoll. these results suggest that B cells in MNV-4 infected mice can still mount an effective adaptive immune response to novel antigens."}
