{"summary": "IFITMs are a subfamily of a larger transmembrane protein family called Dispanins [9], which are generally considered to be comprised of IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM10 [10] the immune-related IFITMs exhibit high constitutive expression in target cells and are strongly induced by types I and II IFNs. the proteins contain a CD225 domain composed of transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) and a cytoplasmic domain. two exons encode transmembrane polypeptides. the N-terminal region plays an important role in the correct cellular localization of IFITM3. us canaria IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009102512), and Nipponia nippon IFITM3 (GenBank: XM_009463652) could restrict influenza viruses, but information regarding goose IFITMs was unavailable. TMUV genome encodes three structural proteins, namely the core (C), membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins. TMUV was a kind gift of the Avian Diseases Research Center of Sichuan Agricultural University. agonists R848 (InvivoGen, USA), Poly (I:C), ODN2006 (InvivoGen, USA) and LPS (InvivoGen, USA) mimic treatment with single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, synthetic oligonucleotides, and lipopolysaccharides. cDNA was stored at 80\u00b0C until needed for cloning and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) the primers IFITM1-F, IFITM1-R, IFITM3-F, and IFITM3-R were designed based on the conserved regions of their respective counterparts in chicken and duck to amplify the partial sequences of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3. the primer IFITM3-3\u2032R was designed according to the predicted IFITM3 sequence from goose transcriptome data. the complete CDs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were amplified using Primer STAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) the complete CDs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were amplified using primer STAR Max DNA polymerase. mRNA expression levels of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in the various tissues were detected by the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad CFX96) the relative expression of target genes was calculated using the Livak and Schmittgen 2CT method [26] and was normalized to goose GAPDH. PBMCs were cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. the cells from each treatment group were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis. five days after infection, three goslings from each group were euthanized. eight tissues (bursa of Fabricius, cecum, cecal tonsil, harderian gland, lung, small intestine, spleen, and thymus) were collected immediately for RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. the nucleotide sequences of IFITM1 and IFITM3 from numerous species were compared by pairwise identity analysis using the Species Demarcation Tool [28]. the phylogenetic evolutionary tree was constructed by MEGA6 using the neighbor-joining method. \u00b0C until needed for cloning and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) the primers IFITM1-F, IFITM1-R, IFITM3-F, and IFITM3-R were designed based on the conserved regions of their respective counterparts in chicken and duck. the full-length cDNA of IFITM3 and the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of IFITM1 were obtained by rapid amplification of the primer IFITM3-3\u2032R was designed according to the predicted IFITM3 sequence from goose transcriptome data [25]. the complete CDs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were amplified using Primer STAR Max DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) were cloned into the pMD19-T vector for sequencing. mRNA expression levels of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in the various tissues were detected by the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) and Eva. the relative expression of target genes was calculated using the Livak and Schmittgen 2CT method [26] and was normalized to goose GAPDH. PBMCs were cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. three goslings from each group were euthanized. eight tissues (bursa of Fabricius, cecum, cecal tonsil, harderian gland, lung, small intestine, spleen, and thymus) were collected immediately for RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. sequences of IFITM1 and IFITM3 from numerous species were compared by pairwise identity analysis using the Species Demarcation Tool [28]. the multiple alignment analysis of amino acid sequences was performed using the neighbor-joining method [30]. the phylogenetic evolutionary tree was constructed by MEGA6 using the neighbor-joining method. the pairwise identity scores of IFITM1 and IFITM3 are shown in Tables S1 and S2 respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of goose IFITM1 (a) and IFITM3 (b) are presented below the nucleotide sequences. terminal domain (NTD: IFITM1, 1\u201353 aa; IFITM3, 1\u201346 aa); conserved intracellular loop (CIL: IFITM1, 77\u2013101 aa; IFITM3, 70\u201399 aa); and short, highly variable C-terminal domain (CTD: IFITM1, 125\u2013129 aa; IFITM3, 123\u2013141 aa) Neither the N- nor C-terminus of either goose IFIT chicken, mouse, and human were subjected to multiple alignment analysis using ClustalW. the proteins each consist of an N-terminal domain (NTD), transmembrane domain 1 (TM1), conserved intracellular loop (CIL), transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), and C-terminal domain (CTD). the blue highlights the Yxx motifs, which are absent in IFITM1. high relative expression levels of goose IFITM3 were detected in the Harderian gland and lung compared to the other tissues. muscle tissue exhibited the lowest transcription level of goose IFITM3. qRT-PCR monitored whether goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were activated in response to exogenous stimulation. TMUV and all the agonists led to extremely significant upregulation of goose IFITM3. however, only poly(I:C) and R848 effectively caused significant upregulation of goose IFITM1. the transcription levels of goose IFITM3 were obviously upregulated in the cecal tonsils and lungs from TMUV-infected animals. mRNA levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were quantified. the identified goose IFITM3 (GenBank: KX594327) contains a 55-bp 5\u2032-UTR, a 390-bp ORF, and a 204-bp 3\u2032-UTR. the nucleotide sequences from fourteen species were compared by pairwise sequence alignment analysis. the five predicted protein domains of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 are indicated by underlining. the blue, pink, and green lines represent extracellular domains, transmembrane helices, and intracellular domains. neither the N- nor C-terminus of either goose IFITM1 or IFITM3 were predicted to be oriented toward the extracellular space. a highly conserved Yxx motif appears in the NTD of IFITM3, which promotes the internalization of IFITM3. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequences of IFITM1 and IFITM3 from diverse species. the avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 were clustered into two groups. predictably, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were closely related to their homologs in ducks. expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 in PBMCs were assessed by qRT-PCR. TMUV and all the agonists led to extremely significant upregulation of goose IFITM3. however, only poly(I:C) and R848 effectively caused significant upregulation of goose IFITM1. transcript levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were quantified in triplicate in the goose PBMCs that were challenged with TMUV, R848, Poly (I:C), ODN2006, and LPS. the data are presented as the mean SEM (n = 3) and were analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed t-test: P 0.05 and P 0.01. 3.6. mRNA levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were quantified. each dot represents an individual goose. the data are presented as the mean SEM (n = 3). phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences showed that goose IFITM1 shares a much higher identity with its counterparts in duck (GenBank: KF584228) and chicken (GenBank: XM_420925) (70.6%) than with duck IFITM3 (GenBank: KF584226) and chicken IFTM3 (GenBank: XM_001233949) (59.4%). the 20-Yxx-23 sorting signal in the N-terminal region is critical for the internalization of IFITM3 from the cell periphery to endosomal compartments. the conserved motif in goose IFITM3 is also involved in the internalization and antiviral actions of duck IFITM3 [18]. in vitro, we explored the immunological characteristics of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3. the mRNA level of IFITM3 in PBMCs sharply increased with TMUV infection and with R848, Poly (I:C), ODN 2006, or LPS treatment. all four agonists and the TMUV genome can be recognized by PRRs. expression levels of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 appeared in TMUV-infected gosling tissues. the lowest viral copy numbers were seen in lung tissues. we speculate that goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 might facilitate IFN-mediated defenses against TMUV."}
