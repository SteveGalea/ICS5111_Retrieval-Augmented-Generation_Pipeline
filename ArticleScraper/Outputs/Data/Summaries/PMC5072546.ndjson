{"summary": "the clinical manifestations of RSV infection range from mild upper-respiratory-tract illnesses (URTIs) to severe and potentially life-threatening lower-respiratory-tract illnesses (LRTIs) the most common form of LRTI in RSV-infected infants is bronchiolitis, but pneumonia and croup are also seen. two independent respiratory specimens can differ, even when both specimens are taken from the same individual at a same time. comparative quantification PCR using a housekeeping gene, such as -actin (ACTB) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) might be suitable for the analysis of these types of respiratory specimens. patients with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, increasing lung markings, dyspnea, or an abnormal pulmonary breath sound were categorized as having LRTI. patients with high fever ( 38\u00b0C), chills, dizziness, headache, myalgia, or debility were categorized as having LRTI. the amplified nucleic acids were detected with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. the cycling conditions were 48\u00b0C for 10 min, 94\u00b0C for 2 min, and then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 s. a Conserved G gene specific for RSV-A, RSV-B, and human ACTB gene were used for detection. a panel of respiratory pathogens commonly found in the respiratory tract were used to determine the specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR. the target DNAs were purified with a TIANprep DNA gel extraction kit. the purity and concentrations of the RNA transcripts were established with a nanodrop spectrophotometer. common respiratory pathogens detected in RSV-positive patients were tested simultaneously for the following 17 respiratory pathogens. comparative viral loads (CVLs) of RSV-A and RSV-B were calculated by dividing the viral load by the amount of human ACTB transcripts in the same sample. p0.05 was considered statistically significant. patients\u2019 clinical presentations were collected from their medical records using designed presentation cards. URTI, LRTI, systemic influenza-like symptoms, gastrointestinal illness, neurological symptoms. patients with high fever, chills, dizziness, headache, myalgia, or debility were categorized as having LRTI. multiplex real-time RT\u2013PCR was conducted using our optimized reaction buffer and cycling conditions. each 25 l reaction mixture contained 1 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.9], 75 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol), 0.6 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.4 M each primer (for RSV A, RSV B, and human ACTB a Conserved G gene specific for RSV-A, RSV-B, and human ACTB gene were used for detection. the nucleic acids were extracted from samples positive for RSV-A, RSV-B, influenza A virus (InfA), influenza B virus (InfB), four types of parainfluenza (PIV1\u20134), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), four strains sensitivity of multiplex real-time PCR was established for RSV-A, RSV-B, and human ACTB RNA transcripts. the target DNAs were purified with a TIANprep DNA gel extraction kit. the purity and concentrations of the RNA transcripts were established with a nanodrop spectrophotometer. common respiratory pathogens detected in RSV-positive patients were tested simultaneously for the following 17 respiratory pathogens. a panel of samples positive for RSV-A, RSV-B, and other respiratory pathogens were tested with the multiplex real-time PCR. fluorescent signals were used to calculate the minimal amounts of detectable RSV-A RNA (20 copies), RSV-B RNA (40 copies), and ACTB mRNA (60 copies) in 5 l of RNA solution. good linear relationships were found from 50 to 5 1010 copies of RSV-A (r2 = 0.9973), 500 to 5 1010 copies of RSV-B (r2 = 0.9989) and 500 to 5 1010 copies of ACTB mRNA (r2 female ratios were 2.33 (261:112) for RSV-A- and RSV-B-positive patients. median ages of the RSV-A- and RSV-B-positive patients were 0.83 years (interquartile range, 0.42\u20131.96) and 0.92 years (interquartile range, 0.42\u20132.00), respectively. copathogens were common, and were found in 128 of the 729 (17.6%) RSV-positive patients. co-pathogena total(n = 128) Co-pathogen with RSV-A (n = 56) Co-pathogen with RSV-B (n = 72) p valueb RV 34(26.6) 14(25) 20(27.8) 0.233 infA 27(21.1) 11(19.6) 16(22.2) of the 729 (97.4%) RSV-positive patients were children under 5 years old (p 0.001) and 632 of the 729 (86.7%;
