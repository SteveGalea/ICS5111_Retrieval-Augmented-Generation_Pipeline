{"summary": "steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) often occurs following steroid treatment for many non-orthopaedic medical conditions [1\u20133], with a morbidity rate of 9% to 40%. patients with SAON often require total hip arthroplasty (THA) after collapse of femoral heads, which accounts for more than 10% of THA performed. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro is regarded as an essential mediator of angiogenesis. the combination of CD with PTH [1\u201334] administration will enhance bone repair and revascularization, thus improving the prognosis of SAON. the whole experiment was performed according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory promulgated by the United States National Institutes of Health. four rabbits each in the SAON and the sham groups were randomly selected for MRI on day 0 and day 14. the rabbits were anaesthetized with intramuscular xylazine and ketamine (50 mg/kg) Rabbits in the SAON group were equally divided into the SAON-CD and SAON-CD-PTH groups randomly (n = 16 each) the sham group served as the Sham-CD group (n = 10) animals were administered recombinant PTH from day 1 to week 6 postoperatively. four rabbits were randomly selected in each group for MRI on Day 0, 14, and 56. the region of interest was set between the distal metaphysis and distal diaphysis. the average signal intensity (SI) of ROI on T1- and T2-weight images and the area ratio of abnormal SI in the femoral marrow was quantified. the distal femurs were prepared to an identical thickness of 8.5 mm with the bone tunnel in the middle. a load was applied to compress the bone precisely perpendicular to the middle of the bone tunnel at a rate of 10mm/min. the parameters of blood vessels, empty osteocyte lacunae, necrosis foci, MS/BS and MAR were analyzed as described previously. RNA isolation and quantitative PCR Distal femurs were cut into half and crushed into powder with liquid nitrogen. total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) western blot Distal femurs (n = 4 in the Sham-CD group, n = 6 in the SAON-CD group, n = 6 in the SAON-CD-PTH group) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed with appropriate secondary antibodies. uthanasia through the common iliac artery was centrifuged to separate serum at 2,000 rpm (425xg) for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the serum calcium level was measured by the automatic biochemical analyzer. all samples, diluted appropriately, were assayed three times. all animals were euthanized by an overdose of pentobarbital at the endpoint. all efforts were made to minimize suffering during the whole experiment. four rabbits each in the SAON and the sham groups received NS as control. rabbits were anaesthetized with intramuscular xylazine and ketamine. CD was performed bilaterally from the attachment of the medial collateral ligament to the contralateral cortex at the medial aspect of the distal femur. MR imaging and analysis Rabbits were anesthetized with intramuscular xylazine (2 mg/kg) and ketamine (50 mg/kg) and MRI was performed (T1-weighted image, TR 540ms, TE 10 ms; T2-weighted image, TR 2500ms, TE 120ms) four rabbits randomly selected in each group for MRI on Day 0, 14, and 56. specimens were subjected to a compression test with a small-diameter (2.5 mm) indenter. the distal femurs were prepared to an identical thickness of 8.5 mm with the bone tunnel in the middle. the medial halves were embedded in resin without decalcification and cut into 10-m sections. the decalcified sections were analyzed under light microscopy. the parameters of blood vessels, empty osteocyte lacunae, necrosis foci, MS/BS and MAR were analyzed. western blot Distal femurs were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. total protein were separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membranes. the following primary antibodies were used: anti-BMP2, anti-VEGF (1:200; Santa Cruz Biltech, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and anti-tubulin (1:8000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). blood was collected during euthanasia through the common iliac artery and centrifuged to separate serum at 2,000 rpm (425xg) for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. osteonecrosis in the distal femurs was established successfully. no changes were observed in the sham group. MRI images and histological analysis confirmed successful establishment of the SAON model. a normal signal was demonstrated in distal femurs of the Sham-CD group. in the SAON-CD group, there was focal inhomogeneous high SI on the T2-weight and low SI in the T2-weight image. however, in the SAON-CD group, there was focal inhomogeneous high SI on both T1-weight and T2-weight images. the vBMD (162.4631.27 vs. 103.9850.57mg/cc, P = 0.021), the BV/TV (3.973.37 vs. 8.224.56%, P = 0.018), the Conn.D (5.913.09 vs. 2.091.88/mm3, P = 0.014) and Tb.N (1.050.30 vs 0.600.25, P = 0.08) were markedly decreased in the SA decreased maximum load (53.187.21 vs.37.379.27 N, P = 0.033) and stiffness (100.4027.56 VS. 52.6518.07 N/m, P = 0.009) were detected in the SAON-CD group. both the loads to failure (60.4020.45 vs.37.379.27 N, P = 0.045) and stiffness (100.4027.56 VS. 52.6518 arrows decreased the number of mononuclear cells and empty lacunas (yellow arrows) in the distal femurs with steroid-induced osteonecrosis after CD. compared with the sham-CD group, a disordered architecture of marrow tissue was observed. TH exerted a strong effect on bone mineralization in SAON after CD surgery. marrow was labeled during regeneration and remodeling by calcein (green) and andalizarin red (red) (A) the MAR and the MAR were measured and presented. data are presented as mean SD, and error bars in the figure denote SD, *p0.05, **p0.01. the number and the mean diameter of vessels in the bone marrow were decreased in the SAON-CD group when compared to the Sham-CD group. levels of BMP-2, bFGF, RUNX2, IGF and VEGF were observed in the SAON-CD-PTH group. RT-PCR detected the gene expression levels of BMP2, Runx2, IGF-1. bFGF and VEGF in the distal femurs from each group. a marker of vascularization reported previously was detected with PTH treatment, as compared to the SAON-CD group. Fig 3 showed that the appearance of abnormal SI, increased ER on T2-weight and decreased ER on T1-weight. the remaining animals were euthanized after six-weeks of PTH/normal saline therapy. the percentage of empty osteocyte lacunae (E) and the mean fat cell diameter (F) were measured. data are presented as mean SD, and error bars in the figure denote SD, **p0.01,*p0.05. a normal signal was demonstrated in distal femurs of the Sham-CD group. PTH enhances osteogenesis in/out of the tunnel in the distal femur Three-dimensional micro-CT images (Fig 5A) revealed less bone formation within the bone tunnel in the SAON-CD group. compared with the SAON-CD group, bone formation was significantly enhanced and the microstructural indices are shown in Fig 5A. the SAON-CD-PTH group, n = 8 in the SAON-CD group, n = 4 in the sham-CD group. error bars in the figure denote SD, *p0.05, **p0.01. both the loads to failure and stiffness were enhanced upon treatment with PTH. PTH promotes the repair of SAON after CD surgery in the bone tunnel and bone marrow of each group. compared with the SAON-CD group, a disordered architecture of marrow tissue was observed with osteonecrosis foci. specimens from the SAON-CD group showed a lower mineral apposition rate (MAR) and mineralizing surface/bone surface (MS/BS), compared with the sham-CD group. no statistically significant differences were found in MS/BS. the number per area of tissue and (D) the diameter of blood vessels were measured. data are presented as mean SD, and error bars in the figure denote SD, *p0.05, **p0.01. as CD could reduce bone marrow pressure and improve capillary blood flow, we also evaluated neovascularization in the bone marrow. the mRNA and protein expression levels of BMP-2, bFGF, RUNX2 and VEGF were decreased while the mRNA expression of IGF-1 was elevated. there were no significant differences between the SAON-CD group versus the Sham-CD group. a higher serum calcium level was observed in the SAON-CD group versus the Sham-CD and SAON-CD-PTH group. a significant increase (P0.05) in serum VEGF level was detected with PTH treatment, as compared to the SAON-CD group. discussions SAON often leads to collapse, which require joint arthroplasty in the final stages [35] MRI is commonly regarded as the most sensitive method for the detection and evaluation of early stage osteonecrosis [36, 37]. MRI is commonly regarded as the most sensitive method for the detection and evaluation of early stage osteonecrosis [36, 37]. analysis revealed more osteoblasts, fewer empty lacunae and osteonecrosis foci. this validated that PTH could enhance bone repair and decrease the incidence of osteonecrosis. this could reduce the incidence of fracture after CD. larger diameter of vessels in the marrow was observed, but unexpectedly, no significant difference in the number of vessels with PTH treatment in the tunnel. bFGF, IGF-1, VEGF and RUNX2 are reported to be the downstream genes affected by PTH administration during osteogenesis and angiogenesis [29\u201331]. low serum osteocalcin levels were found in glucocorticoid-treated patients. both local expression and serum VEGF level was increased in the SAON-CD-PTH group, as compared with the SAON-CD group. the quantification of osteoblasts is shown. data are presented as mean SD, and error bars in the figure denote SD, *p0.05, **p0.01."}
