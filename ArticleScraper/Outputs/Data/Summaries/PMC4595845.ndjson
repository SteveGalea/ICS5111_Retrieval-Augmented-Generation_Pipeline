{"summary": "the majority (94%) of zoonotic viruses described to date (n = 162) are RNA viruses, which is 28 times higher than the proportion of RNA viruses among all vertebrate viruses recognized. wild animals were significantly more likely to be a source for animal-to-human spillover than domesticated species (exact P = 0.001) most (63%) zoonotic viruses infecting humans were reported in animal hosts from at least two different taxonomic orders. 45% were reported in four or more orders, in addition to humans. virus-host unipartite network illustrates high connectivity among host groups sharing zoonotic viruses. the width of each edge connecting hosts is proportionate to the number of viruses shared by the connection between hosts. aViral family was included as a main effect in the model. primate hosts were most frequently cited as the source of viruses transmitted by direct contact during hunting. rodent hosts were more likely to be implicated in transmission by indirect contact in and around human dwellings and in agricultural fields. 40% of zoonotic viruses involving wild animals required arthropod vectors for transmission to humans. human-to-human transmission of zoonoses facilitates sustained spread of disease with a rapidity and reach infeasible for zoonotic viruses. we find virus host plasticity to be positively correlated with capability for human-to-human transmission. viruses in the arenaviridae and filoviridae families are more likely to possess human-to-human transmissibility. zoonotic viruses found in 10 host orders are 12 times more likely to be human-to-human transmissible than zoonotic viruses found in only one animal host order. zoonotic viruses found in 10 host orders are 12 times more likely to be human-to-human transmissible than zoonotic viruses found in only one animal host order. human practices facilitating heightened contact between taxonomically diverse animal hosts have likely facilitated selection of viruses with high host plasticity. increased host range among viruses transmitted by wildlife kept in similarly confined circumstances supports the concept that the breeding and keeping of taxonomically diverse domesticated species in regular close contact with people. risk for a new human pandemic is likely highest at the high-risk interfaces facilitating disease threats in the past. wild animal hosts and high-risk interfaces facilitating spillover of zoonotic viruses, particularly beyond their first emergence, remains vastly under-reported. zoonoses, infectious animal disease, emerging wildlife disease, cross checked with world health organization (WHO), fda, CDC, and the OIE web-based reports. pathogen-specific searches using the Web of Science database were then made using pathogen common and scientific names to identify general transmission properties and specific circumstances involved in disease transmission from animals to humans. each virus was categorized as human-to-human transmissible if horizontal human-to-human transmission was reported. transmission interfaces involving wildlife were stratified by direct and indirect contact transmission and summarized in categories describing human contact as follows. animal species included were implicated in the scientific reports as hosts suspected in animal-to-human transmission of a given virus. domestic species were grouped according to taxonomy and stratified by similarity in circumstances for human use of animals and their products. zoonotic viruses were further classified according to 3 categories of international spread. bipartite affiliation (two-mode) networks were generated for virus-host and virus-interface matrix data to evaluate connectedness between host orders and high-risk disease transmission interfaces involving wildlife. betweenness centrality was measured for all viruses to indicate the number of connections with wild and domestic animal hosts in the virus-host network. virus host plasticity, general transmission categories, and wildlife transmission interfaces were also evaluated for associations with international spread. putative risk factors with P 0.20 in univariable analyses were entered forward stepwise and retained in models if P 0.05. deviance measures were used to evaluate changes in model fit to the data with each parameter independently. hosts and human activities associated with naturally occurring animal-to-human transmission from 1990\u20132010 were collated and summarized for each virus. zoonotic viruses were included in analyses of interfaces and hosts if data were available on the circumstances surrounding virus transmission from animals to humans. each virus was also categorized as human-to-human transmissible if horizontal human-to-human transmission was reported. an extended search was conducted to identify confirmed or suspected hosts serving as a source of spillover. animal species included were implicated in the scientific reports as hosts suspected in animal-to-human transmission of a given virus. wild terrestrial host species were then categorized further by taxonomic order, except for orders within superorder xenarthra. a literature search was conducted to identify geographic range reported for each virus in humans and animals. zoonotic viruses were further classified according to 3 categories of international spread based on published reports as to whether viruses had been reported within a single country only. network analyses were conducted in the network analysis platform Gephi. centrality indices were normalised for two-mode data26. unadjusted bivariate relationships were examined using exact statistics. overall model fit was evaluated using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. incidence rate and odds ratios were estimated with 95% confidence intervals."}
