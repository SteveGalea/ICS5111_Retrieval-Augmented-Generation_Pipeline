{"summary": "airborne particulate matter (PM), e.g., PM2.5 and PM10 can be easily removed by mucosal clearance. higher specific surface area of PM2.5 facilitates their role as carrier for numerous contaminants, such as water soluble inorganic ions, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pathogens and bioaerosols. pathogenic microorganisms bound onto the PM are becoming a threat to public health. airborne sampling methods involve air pump-mediated compression of air, followed by impact of microbes on the surface of quartz filters. impact process may lead to the escape of abundant microbes from the filters, also resulting in undervaluation of microbial integrity. the gelatin filters were dissolved in 5 mL sterile water (preheated to 37 \u00b0C) the gelatin filters were lysed by the alkaline lysing liquid (NaOH 50 mmol/L, SDS 1%, Protease K 10 mg/L, RNase 20 mg/L) the extracted DNA was stored at 80 \u00b0C for further use. the primers were synthesized by Sangon Ltd., Beijing. high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA. sequences with similarities greater than or equal to 97% were grouped into operational taxonomic units. morphology of PM samples on the gelatin membranes was characterized by a Phenom scanning electron microscope (SEM), supported with image software (SEM, ProX, Holland) DNA extraction The gelatin filters were dissolved in 5 mL sterile water (preheated to 37 \u00b0C) primer 806R (5\u2032-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u2032) and ITS2 (5\u2032-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3\u2032) primers synthesized by Sangon Ltd., Beijing. high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA The obtained total 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA were sequenced by double end sequencing (Paired-End) method. daily average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations estimated from samples collected from November 30 to December 21, 2016. a total of 584 OTUs of bacteria and 370 OTUs of fungi at the genus level were identified during hazy days. in all samples, Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, and four other dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. compared to the samples from the clear days, the samples from hospitals and traffic hubs during hazy days contain much higher levels of human health-related bacteria. the genus Sphingomonas is detected on both the clear days and hazy days. the dominant fungi were Malassezia (58.0%) in Hosp1 and (54.9%) in Hosp2, Alternaria (55.5%) and Cladosporium (9.17%) in Tran3. the sample Sch3 showed partially similar bacterial diversity to the control group. concentrations of PM2.5 were higher than 200 g/m3 in 8 days. concentrations of PM10 were higher than 200 g/m3 in 10 days. TUs of fungi at the genus level were identified during hazy days. rarefaction curves and Shannon index derived from observed OTU numbers. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, and four other dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. compared to the samples from the clear days, the samples from hospitals and traffic hubs during hazy days contain much higher levels of human health-related bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, and Du icolor, Malassezia (Pityrosporum) folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Alternaria could enter the deep lung and cause respiratory diseases[24]. in china, numerous studies have been conducted to monitor regional air pollution[27] and the exposure-response relationships between airborne PM and cardiovascular diseases. however, little information has been available on the association of particle-bound pathogenic bacteria with the prevalence of infectious diseases and epidemics. the results showed that both bacterial and fungal diversities could be accurately evaluated by this method. this study provides a new strategy for evaluation and surveillance of airborne epidemic diseases that increasingly threaten urban population."}
