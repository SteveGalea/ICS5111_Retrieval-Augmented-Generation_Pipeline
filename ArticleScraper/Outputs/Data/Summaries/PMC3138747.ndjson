{"summary": "the caseins are serine rich phospho-proteins which are almost exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland [1], [2]. in cows the casein proteins together constitute up to 80% of total milk protein and also 80% of total mRNA in the lactating mammary gland [3]. can sequester amorphous calcium phosphate, probably in the Golgi vesicles of mammary secretory cells, to form thermodynamically stable complexes of defined chemical composition. apatite only forms by maturation of the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate. in most milks, the majority of the total calcium is sequestered within the casein micelles. amplicon size acas6 5\u2032 GTT CCA GTA CGC TAA GAG CTT AAA ACT GC 3\u2032 acas7 5\u2032 TAG GGG GCA AAA ATG TGT ATT ATC CTA GC 3\u2032 53\u00b0C 1566 bp acas6 5\u2032 TAG GGG GCA AAA ATG TGT ATT ATC CTA GC 3\u2032 53\u00b0C 1566 bp acas6 5\u2032 GTT CCA GTA GG TAA GGG AAG AAG AT 3\u2032 53\u00b0C 289 bp mGAPDH1 5\u2032 GCT TTC CAG AGG GGC CAT CCA CA 3\u2032 mGAPDH2 5\u2032 ACG GCA AAT TCA ACG GCA CAG TCA A 3\u2032 61\u00b0C 426 bp acas1 5\u2032 ATG AAA CTC CTC ATC CTC ACC TGC 3\u2032 acas7 5\u2032 TAG the targeting construct carries a hygromycin-thymidine kinase fusion gene under the control of the murine phospho-glycerol kinase (PGK) promoter as selection marker. mice were kept in same-sex groups of 2 to 6 littermates. animals were kept in opaque M3 type cages with dimensions of 48(15(13(cm) from North Kent Plastics, UK equipped with bedding (\u2018Eco-bedding\u2019, B&K Universal Ltd, UK) and nesting material (\u2018Nestlet\u2019, Datesand Ltd, UK) the environment was kept at 21+/(2(C and 55+/(15% relative air humidity with a 12(hour light 12(hour dark cycle (lights off 8:00 pm) food and tap water one wild type female had 1 pup stillborn and 2 born alive but lost between day 1 and cross fostering. two -casein deficient females lost 2 pups and one pup respectively between day 1 and cross fostering. 0 Dragging 1 Horizontally extended 2 Elevated/Straub Tail (>45\u00b0) Touch Escape: Approach the mouse with a finger sideways. 0 No response Observe how close the finger is when the mouse escapes. 1 Slight resistance 2 Extreme resistance, board like Corneal Reflex: Stimulate the cornea of the mouse with the 0 None body (not the tip) 1 Active single eye blink the mouse closes the eyelids. pups were weighed every second day and screened daily to detect the day when both eyes were opened. day 3: presence/absence of a milk spot and position of the animals regarding the nest was taken with a cut off time of 60 sec. muscle tonus in fore/hind legs and abdomen was recorded by applying slight pressure with the index finger of the free hand. to assess reflexive biting reaction, the individual was stimulated with a cotton swab followed by a check for conspicuous teeth and mucosa condition. the animals were individually screened using a protocol adapted from [22], including parameters on health, general behaviour and reactivity, reflexes and muscle strength. first the animal was placed into a transparent Perspex cylinder (height 18 cm, 15 cm) and observed regarding general activity, respiration and occurrence of tremor. the animal was transferred into a Makrolon IV cage (423027 cm, Allentown) milk samples were well suspended, diluted 1 in 4 in distilled water, and centrifuged for 5 sec. at 200 g in a table top centrifuge. the lower phase containing the defatted whole milk was removed from the upper lipid layer into a new tube and diluted with 2 volumes of distilled water. the pellet containing the whey fraction was re-suspended in an equivalent of 3 volumes (of starting volume) of distilled water. the extracts were incubated on ice for 5 min. and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 1 min. at 10000 g.

Western blots were done after semi-dry transfer of the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane as described [25] RNA and quantitative PCR RNA were isolated from tissues using the Ambion RNAwiz reagent following the supplier's protocol. a one in 10 dilution of the reaction was then used as template for quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast System) PCR arrays were carried out using a mouse apoptosis array. expression of casein genes was then correlated with expression of reference genes (-actin or GAPDH) the slides were then washed in deionised water and 1 PBS. slides were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight after addition of primary antibody. slides were then washed twice for 5 min. in 1 PBS-Tween. horseradish peroxidise activity was detected using a dye-kit. protein concentrations were measured using a Bradford assay (Sigma) the assay provides a pro-luminescent caspase-3/7 substrate, which contains the amino acid sequence DEVD in a reagent optimised for caspase activity, luciferase activity and cell lysis. three or more parallel samples were analysed to measure caspase activity. a targeting construct was established based on previous experience with constructs used to inactivate the - and -casein genes. the targeting event removes the complete second exon which includes the translational start codon and the 15 amino acid signal peptide. the hytk selection marker gene is indicated as striped box. the PGK promoter element directing expression of the selection marker gene is indicated as arrowhead. the relative positions of the EcoRI restriction sites (EI), the Southern blot probe (probe), sizes of hybridising DNA fragments and the primer binding sites used for genotyping are indicated. a 688 bp band is detected in both samples and represents the unmodified -casein allele [U] the second clone carries a targeted -casein allele as indicated by the occurrence of a 450 bp PCR product [T]. grp78/BiP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. in addition two further ER-resident proteins, grp94 and PDIA6 were detected in milk of the -casein deficient mice. milk was purified as indicated in the methods section and defatted whole milk, whey and the casein fraction were separated on a 10% gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. band protein aa expected MW reported MW observed MW MS score coverage number of sequences #1 transferrin 697 78.8 kDa 80

species. the number of peptide sequences and the fraction of the total protein covered are also indicated. protein bands #9-13 are detected in the milk of wild-type mice. homozygous [/] -casein deficient mice (n = 5) were scanned in a Kodak densitometer. the net intensity of the milk proteins was compared with the intensities of molecular weight marker proteins of know concentration. comparisons of [+/] vs [+/+] are significant with p0.05. the ratio of -casein to albumin in control milk is 21. the ratio in milk from homozygous -casein deficient mice is 11. this reduction is also detected by Western blot analysis. in to -casein (acas/bcas), -casein to -casein (bcas/gcas), -casein to albumin (bcas/alb.) and -casein to albumin (gcas/alb.) were determined. the data were analysed by ANOVA for one way comparisons. grp78, grp94 and PDIA6 are all ER resident proteins. their up-regulation is typically associated with ER stress. this suggests that the lack of -casein protein in mammary epithelial cells induces ER stress. the grp78/BiP protein was detected using a goat-anti grp78 antiserum. panel C: Correlation of gene expression in wild type [+/+], heterozygous [+/] and -casein deficient mice using quantitative PCR. lower casein protein levels in -casein deficient mice are accompanied by a significantly lower concentration of calcium and phosphate in milk. cDNA derived from representative wild-type, heterozygous [+/] and homozygous [/] -casein deficient mice was analysed using primer pairs specific for -casein, -casein and reference gene GAPDH. quantification of -casein was done in 3 [+/+], 3 [+/] and 3 [/] mice. expression in heterozygous and -casein deficient mice is presented as percentage of median casein gene expression in wild-type control mice [+/+] (set to 100%) Error bars represent standard deviations. expression is reduced to around 20% of control levels in -casein deficient mice. no consistent reduction of -casein, -casein and -casein expression is detected. expression changes in heterozygous vs wild-type mice are marginally or not significant. k-casein was done in 3 [+/+], 3 [+/] and 3 [/] mice. p values are below the cut off points of 0.01 or 0.001. sections of mammary tissue were obtained from animals at peak lactation. caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity was measured in cytoplasmic protein extracts. a significant increase in caspase activity could be detected in RAW cells treated with 10 M staurosporin. extracts from RAW264 cells treated with 10 M staurosporin (STS) were used as positive control. the sizes of the protein molecular weight markers are indicated as are the positions of the -actin and caspase 3 proteins. potential changes in candidate genes were assessed using a PCR array containing 84 apoptosis related genes. expression of 16 genes was changed significantly (11 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated in -casein deficient mice vs. control) only 3 genes showed consistent and significant expression differences between control and -casein deficient animals. weight gain during lactation was significantly reduced in offspring nursed by -casein deficient dams with the other two groups after day 3. effect was seen when -casein deficient dams nursed their own pups and if the offspring of wild-type mice was nursed by deficient dams. effect was seen in two further litters after breeding of the -casein deficient mice onto a CD1 background. panel A: Photograph of wild-type mice nursed by wild-type and -casein deficient dams at 11 days of age. panel B: Photograph of mice nursed

-casein deficient dams was not significantly different. the growth rate of wild-type and heterozygous pups nursed by wild-type dams was not significantly different (p = 0.729 for both comparisons) mice nursed by -casein deficient dams were exposed to an early phenotyping protocol. pre-weaning observations indicated physical impairment in the \u2018small\u2019 mice. 60% and 50% of the pups nursed by wild-type dams had both eyes opened on day 14. significantly fewer pups nursed by -casein deficient females showed a provoked biting response at day 21 when compared to wild-type dams (100%) at pre-weaning the -casein deficient milk suckled pups were smaller and physically weaker than those reared on wild-type milk. eye condition norm/consp 21 ns whiskers trimmed n/y 21 ns discharge from

analysis assessing the 5\u2032 end of the targeted -casein gene. panel C: PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from three representative ES cell clones using primer combination acas6, acas7 and pBKpA2. a 1566 bp band is detected in all samples and represents the unmodified -casein allele [U: unmodified] the second clone carries a targeted -casein allele as indicated by the occurrence of a 450 bp PCR product [T: targeted] milk from control animals showed a series of protein bands, with the most prominent proteins corresponding to molecular weights previously observed for -, - and -casein. the identity of the proteins bands was confirmed using mass-spectrometry. milk from -casein deficient mice shows some characteristic protein bands which are absent from milk of wild-type or heterozygous mice. panel B: SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of milk derived from wild-type [+/+], heterozygous [+/] and homozygous [/] -casein deficient mice. defatted whole milk, whey and the casein fraction were separated on a 15% gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. the sizes of the protein molecular weight markers are indicated as is the position of WAP (whey acidic protein). 3.6 kDa 43 kDa 42

of milk derived from wild-type mice. the -casein protein was detected using a goat-anti -casein antiserum. comparisons of [+/] vs [+/+] are significant with p0.05 (*) where indicated. for comparisons against wild-type mice in a one-way ANOVA p0.01 is indicated by **, p0.001 by ***. analysis of the data using one-way ANOVA showed that the changes in the concentration of - and -casein in the milk of -casein deficient mice are highly significant (p>0.001; Table 5). the concentration of milk proteins is consistent with published data [5]. in -casein deficient milk the reduction in protein secretion also affects the mouse WAP protein, which is secreted into the whey fraction of milk. this suggests that all milk proteins secreted from mammary epithelial cells are affected by the absence of -casein. -casein deficiency causes a generalised reduction in milk secretion. analysis of gene expression rates of grp78, grp94 and PDIA6 confirms all three genes are significantly up-regulated in tissue samples of -casein deficient mice. REDD1 [34] is not significantly regulated by the absence of -casein. quantification was done in 3 [+/+], 5 [+/] and 5 [/] mice. expression increases for biP, grp94 and REDD1 observed in -casein deficient mice with respect to both wild-type and heterozygous. cDNA derived from representative wild-type, heterozygous [+/] and homozygous [/] -casein deficient mice was analysed using primer pairs specific for -casein, -casein and the reference gene GAPDH. expression of the casein genes was correlated with the reference gene and is expressed as pg casein/pg GAPDH. control mice [+/+] (set to 100%) error bars represent standard deviations. for comparisons against wild-type mice in a one-way ANOVA p0.05 is indicated by *, p0.01 by **, and p0.001 by ***. expression of the casein genes was correlated with expression of the reference genes GAPDH and -actin (Fig. 5d) the consistent reduction of -, - and -casein gene expression in the -casein deficient mammary tissue is highly significant. expression changes in heterozygous vs wild-type mice are marginally or not significant (all p values>0.01; table 6). sections of mammary tissue were obtained from animals at peak lactation. as expected -casein expression was clearly detectable in tissue from wild-type control mice and heterozygous mice. in contrast no -casein protein could be detected in sections of a-casein deficient mice. panel A: Paraffin embedded sections of mammary tissue (day 10 lactation) were analysed using a rabbit-anti -casein antiserum. slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. analysis of caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity in cytoplasmic extracts. extracts derived from RAW264 cells treated with staurosporin were used as positive control. expression of genes encoding apoptosis related proteins nucleolar protein 3 (Nol3; up-regulated), Birc5 (up-regulated) and Traf1 (down-regulated) were correlated with the expression of the reference gene -actin. expression of anti-apoptotic genes survivin (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing-5; Birc5) and nucleolar protein 3 (Nol3/ARC: nuclear apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) increased by 22 and 2.5 fold respectively. expression of another anti-apoptotic gene, TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (Traf1), was reduced to 5% of control levels in -casein deficient mice. all females were able to nurse their pups, as indicated by the presence of milk in the stomach (\u2018milk spot\u2019) by day 6, pups nursed by -casein deficient dams were visibly emaciated. by mid-lactation offspring nursed by -casein deficient mice are significantly smaller than offspring nursed by control dams. panel B: Photograph of mice nursed by wild-type and -casein deficient dams at 11 days of age. panel D: Photograph of mice nursed by wild-type and -casein deficient dams at 21 days of age. wild-type pups nursed by -casein deficient dams had a significantly slower growth rate than pups nursed by wild-type dams. growth rate of wild-type and heterozygous pups nursed by wild-type dams was not significantly different. 60% and 50% of the pups nursed by wild-type dams had both eyes opened on day 14. all of the pups nursed by wild-type dams still had their eyes closed at that age, opening them only around 3 days later. day 14 day 15 day 16 day 17 day 18 median G1 (wt \u2013 wt) 18 14 1 0 1 day 14 G2 (wt \u2013 null) 0 0 10 14 1 day 17 G3 (het \u2013 wt) 11 11 0 0 0 day 14.5 The number of pups opening their eyes on the indicated day are presented. y/n 21 ns sense of touch y/n 21 ns vision y/n 21 ns gait norm/consp 21 ns tail position norm/consp 21 p0.05 provoked biting y/n 21 p0.05 hanging on grid y/n 21 p0.05 fur norm/consp 21 p0.05 faeces weighing cage 21 p0.05 vertical pole test 21 p0.05 Significance level p0.05 for Fisher's exact test the role of caseins in milk protein secretion Deficiency for -casein severely impairs milk protein secretion in mice. in contrast -casein deficiency does not result in a similar decline. deficiency for -casein (but not for -casein) may decrease the stability of the biofluid. results argue against a functional redundancy of the calcium-sensitive caseins. milk protein secretion from mammary epithelial cells is curtailed in homozygous -casein deficient mice. the lack of -casein has significant impacts on protein processing and transport in the mammary epithelium. secretion of grp78/BiP and grp94 is also observed in mice over-expressing human protein C. lactation is not terminated prematurely in the deficient animals suggesting that at least a significant portion of the mammary epithelial cells is viable. a reduction in the expression of the Traf1 gene suggests a balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses to -casein deficiency. steady state levels of mRNAs encoding -casein, -casein and -casein are also severely reduced in the mammary gland of -casein deficient mice. the effect of -casein deficiency in mice is similar to that reported for a S1-casein deficient goat breed (Cn0) the absence of -casein does not appear to have a critical effect on calcium secretion in goats. this indicates that there may be species (and maybe also strain-) specific differences in the assembly of casein micelles. protein deficient diets have been implicated as important regulators of metabolic programming and later health outcomes in mice and men. the combination of poor foetal and rapid post-natal growth leads to increased susceptibility for metabolic disease and reduces life-span. axis result in both, small body size and an increased life- and health-span. increased resistance to metabolic disease is also observed in mice nursed by dams on a low protein diet. -casein may decrease the stability of the biofluid resulting in a precipitation of calcium-phosphate in the Golgi vesicles. the results argue against a functional redundancy of the calcium-sensitive caseins (-, -, - and -casein) despite the clear evidence for changes to the expression and localisation of ER resident proteins there is no clear evidence for significant increases in mammary apoptosis in the absence of -casein. lactation is not terminated prematurely in the deficient animals suggesting that at least a significant portion of the mammary epithelial cells is viable. steady state levels of mRNAs encoding -casein, -casein and -casein are also severely reduced in the mammary gland of -casein deficient mice. the deletion of cis-acting DNA elements in the -casein gene may affect the expression of the entire casein gene locus. effect of -casein deficiency in mice is similar to that reported for a S1-casein deficient goat breed (Cn0) the absence of -casein does not appear to have a critical effect on calcium secretion in goats. the most critical consequence of -casein deficiency for the offspring is a sustained shortfall in body size. iency in the mother leads to intra-uterine growth delay in offspring. but when such offspring is cross-fostered onto dams on a control diet, they show a phase of rapid catch up growth during lactation. the combination of poor foetal and rapid post-natal growth leads to increased susceptibility for metabolic disease. phenotype of -casein deficient dams confirm role of lactation in determining life-long body size and underline role of protein supply during this developmental window. mice represent a genetically defined model system of nutritional restriction with a significant impact on whole animal metabolism."}
