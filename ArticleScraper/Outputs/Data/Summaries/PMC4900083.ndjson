{"summary": "cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for avascular necrosis of the hip, but it is rare even in cirrhosis patients. cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for avascular necrosis of the hip. the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry (DHR) is a clinical database of all primary or revision total hip arthroplasties performed in Denmark since January 1, 1995. the indication for arthroplasty has been confirmed by medical chart review and radiographs in 79 of 80 randomly selected AVN patients. we excluded reference individuals according to the same criteria as cirrhosis patients. the reference individuals were given the same index date as the corresponding cirrhosis patient. this exclusion resulted in a situation where not all cirrhosis patients were matched 1:5. we followed the cirrhosis patients and the reference individuals from the index date to the date of total hip arthroplasty for AVN, date of death, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2011). we found no violations of the proportional hazards assumption when we tested it using Schoenfeld residuals and checked it by inspecting the log-log plot. alcohol intake is a well-known risk factor for AVN, and cirrhosis patients have a high prevalence of alcohol intake. we repeated the regression analysis and restricted it to cirrhosis patients who had not been hospitalized for an alcohol-related disorder. all Danish residents are given universal, tax-paid access to hospitals. the central office of civil registration monitors the vital status of Danish residents. it issues a unique personal identification number to everyone at birth or immigration. this number enables linkage of individual-level data between the NPR, the DHR, and the civil registration system. we identified previous emergency room visits, inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations for conditions predisposing to AVN (diabetes, HIV infection, myeloproliferative disease, hemoglobinopathy, chronic renal failure, gout, and solid organ transplantation) as an indicator of alcohol intake, we identified emergency room visits and inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations for alcoholism or alcohol-related disorders before the index date. une hepatitis 573.02 K73.2, K75.4 0.90 0.02 Rheumatoid arthritis 712.0x\u2013712.2x M05.x 0.56 0.44 Connective tissue disease 734.xx M3x.x 0.73 1.2 Outcomes and statistical analysis We examined one outcome: time to total hip arthroplasty for AVN. we used stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of total hip arthroplasty for all statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12.1 and the R software package version 2.14. results We included 25,421 cirrhosis patients and 114,052 reference individuals. their median age was 57 years and 65% were male. 45 cirrhosis patients and 44 reference individuals underwent total hip arthroplasty for AVN. a nationwide cohort study found a strong association between cirrhosis and total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis. the absolute risks of a total hip arthroplasty for AVN were low, but markedly higher in cirrhosis patients than in reference individuals. the main strength of this study was its population-based design and complete follow-up. incomplete confounder control could have led us to overestimate the effect of cirrhosis on the rate of total arthroplasty for AVN. cirrhosis patients suffer from coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for avascular necrosis requiring total hip arthroplasty. avascular necrosis is a rare condition, even in cirrhosis patients. a causal link between cirrhosis and AVN is plausible."}
