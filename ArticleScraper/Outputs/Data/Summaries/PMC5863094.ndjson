{"summary": "wild-type (WT) measles virus (MeV) is transmitted by aerosol or respiratory droplet (77,90) and spreads from the respiratory tract to lymphoid tissue. infected mononuclear cells enter the circulation and spread the virus to multiple nonlymphoid organs (e.g., skin, conjunctivae, kidney, lung, and liver) lipid envelope belongs to the morbillivirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae. the 16 kb genome encodes eight proteins. six proteins are found in the virion. three receptors have been identified: membrane cofactor protein or CD46, a complement regulatory protein present on all nucleated cells. signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) or CD150, present on activated immune cells. polio virus receptor related 4 or nectin 4 present on epithelial cells. the live attenuated measles vaccine was developed at the same time as the formalin-inactivated vaccine with initial passage of the Edmonston virus in primary renal and amnion cells. the original Edmonston wild type virus was isolated in human cells and attenuated primarily by passage in chick embryo fibroblasts. the formalin-inactivated measles vaccine was delivered with a three-dose schedule, but provided only short-term protection from measles. Previously vaccinated children were at risk for developing a prolonged high fever, hemorrhagic or vesicular rash, and severe pneumonitis (142). studies in monkeys have shown that atypical measles is due to failure of the inactivated vaccine to induce a mature Ab or T cell response with greb has a slightly different lineage that includes passage in human WI-38 cells (8,128). the original Edmonston wild type virus was attenuated primarily by passage in chick embryo fibroblasts. the further attenuated Schwarz, Moraten, and Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine strains are widely used throughout the world. adaptation of WT MeV to growth in vero cells selects for a virus that no longer causes a rash in monkeys (6,70,175) many studies of virulence have focused on the changes required for growth of WT MeV in vero cells or CEFs. changes in multiple protein genes (P/C/V, M, F, H, and L) are selected. cynomolgus macaques of recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing WT viruses with vaccine (Ed-tag) H instead of WT (IC-B) H showed attenuation without a change in tropism. the importance of changes in any of these parameters for in vivo attenuation is unclear. analysis of validated C and V proteins from vaccine and WT strains shows no differences in ability to regulate the IFN response (44,105) there is little evidence of type I IFN induction in humans with measles (190) activated lymphocytes, activated monocytes, and mature dendritic cells (DCs) are the most important receptor for meV infection of lymphoid tissue (28,75) vaccine and WT viruses use SLAM as a receptor (39,86\u201388,111,119,153,155,182,187) recombinant viruses contain mutations (Y110H, C272R) present in the early MeV vaccine cDNA clone (EdTag) that are not present in vaccine strains. analysis of validated C and V proteins from vaccine and WT strains shows no differences in ability to regulate the IFN response. infected DCs and macrophages are major early myeloid cell targets of WT and vaccine MeV (28,30), and after intramuscular infection of macaques with eGFP-expressing EZ MeV vaccine, infected DCs and macrophages can be visualized at the site of inoculation. infection may provide an important pathway for entry into many tissues. ab that neutralizes infectivity of MeV is directed primarily against the H protein, with some contribution from Ab to F (29). high avidity Ab to H is required for neutralization of SLAM-mediated WT MeV infection of lymphoid cells, but not for neutralization of CD46-mediated vaccine virus infection of Vero cells. the current vaccine is usually given subcutaneously or intramuscularly in combination with live virus vaccines for mumps, rubella (MMR), and sometimes varicella (MMRV) not all children respond to the initial dose of measles and rubella (MR) vaccine given in infancy (85% at 9 months, 95% at 12 months) a phase 1 trial of the MeV recombinant CHIKV vaccine showed that it was safe and induced Abs to CHIKV in adults with pre-existing MeV immunity (141). cancer treatment Because the MeV vaccine is cytolytic for many tumor cells in vitro (11,113), recombinant MeVs are also being retargeted as oncolytic agents for cancer therapy. these approaches have shown promise in animal models and clinical trials using doses orders of magnitude higher recombinant MeVs are being retargeted as oncolytic agents for cancer therapy. these approaches have shown promise in animal models and clinical trials. they have been initiated for treatment of multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, T cell lymphoma, and glioblastoma (47,74,81,99,149,183,188,189)"}
