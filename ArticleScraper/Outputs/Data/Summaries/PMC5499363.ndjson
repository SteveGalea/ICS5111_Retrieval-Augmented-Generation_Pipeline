{"summary": "dengue disease may present as a nonspecific febrile illness or as a more severe infection marked by hemorrhage or circulatory failure. deNV is a flavivirus that exists as 4 distinct serotypes (DENV-1\u2013DENV-4) and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (5). peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy blood donors can be used to generate monocyte-derived DCs. these cells can be productively infected with DENV and are the primary human ex vivo model for studying primary DENV infections. a comprehensive functional analysis comparing DC infections with DENV-2 and its most phylogenetically distant serotype, DENV-4. we show that DENV-2 and DENV-4 display different replication strategies and induce different antiviral innate immune responses in human DCs. this may be related to differences in viral fitness, transmission, and pathogenesis. DCs infected with DENV-2 showed significantly higher levels of DENV nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein (Figure 1C) at 48 and 72 hpi compared with the DCs infected with DENV-4. together, these data suggest that DENV-2 infects fewer DCs later during infection, with each infected cell producing many infectious particles. paired, 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared DENV-4 to DENV-2. asterisks represent statistical significance for either DENV-2 or DENV-4 compared with mock-infected cells at each time point. DCs infected with DENV-2 and DENV-4 did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in expression of cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, or in levels of cell death. cellular marker positivity during mock, dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), and DENV-4 infections by autogating. the comparative effects on each marker were calculated as the log10 of the relative risk for positive marker frequency between the indicated infection conditions. the phenotypic landscape is different during DENV-2 versus DENV-4 infection in DCs. cells expressing high levels of DENV envelope (DENV E) protein were not limited to one phenotypic DC population. IL-8 expression was more broadly distributed but also largely colocalized to the same region of the viSNE plots. cells most highly expressing IP-10 did not correspond with DENV E\u2013expressing cells. the responses to DENV infection were heterogeneous and there were distinct cellular phenotypes associated with cells expressing viral antigens. the previous data (Figures 2 and 3) revealed marked phenotype differences induced by DENV-2 and DENV-4 for the entire population of each DC sample. proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IL-1), chemokines (IL-8) and ISGs (IP-10) demonstrated distinct patterns of production in DENV-infected versus bystander DCs. both DENV-2\u2013 and DENV-4\u2013infected DCs demonstrated higher percentages of cleaved caspase-3+ cells compared with their respective bystander cells at later time points. the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was performed within each time point to adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons. bystander cells show distinct cytokine and cleaved caspase-3 phenotypes compared with infected cells during DENV infection. multiplex ELISAs were performed to evaluate extracellular cytokine secretion by DCs during DENV infection. in contrast, DENV-2 infection induced minimal IFN- and IP-10 secretion compared with mock and DENV-2 infection of DCs. deNV-4 infection also induced greater secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with mock infection. cytokine and chemokine production during DENV-2 and DENV-4 infection appears to be replication dependent. differences in cytokine and chemokine production could be due to the different proportion of infected cells in the culture between the two viruses. e and chemokine secretion depended less on viral load (MOI) and more on inherent strain differences between the two virus strains. we infected human donor-matched DCs with DENV-2 and DENV-4 (MOI of 0.5) the viral isolates used were representative of prevalent genotypes of the DENV-2 and DENV-4 serotypes. DENV-2 and DENV-4 demonstrate replication differences in human DCs but not in mosquito cells. mass cytometry by time-of-flight analysis of DCs infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) and DENV-4. we observed comparable replication kinetics for DENV-2 and DENV-4 during a 5-day time course. the rapid peak and subsequent decline in titers for DENV-4 during DC infection was not observed in mosquito cells. these viruses have different replication kinetics, and presumably different viral fitness strategies, in human DCs but not in mosquito cells. DCs infected with DENV-2 and DENV-4 did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in expression of cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, or in levels of cell death. compared cellular marker positivity during mock, dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), and DENV-4 infections by autogating. viSNE plots were generated using all 18 phenotypic markers used for mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) staining except markers for dengue virus. each point in the plot represents a single cell, and the axes show arbitrary units based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm. a small number of cells expressing high levels of DENV E were visible but distributed throughout the viSNE plots. DC costimulatory markers CD80, CD86, and CD40 were notably upregulated during DENV-2 infection compared with mock treatment. this indicates that the cells upregulating cytokines are distinct from those upregulating high levels of DC maturation markers during DENV infection. DC activation markers CD80, CD86, CD40, and CCR7 were similarly upregulated by DENV-infected and bystander cells following both DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections. both DENV-2\u2013infected and DENV-4\u2013infected DCs showed increased production of TNF-+ and IL-1+ cells compared with their respective bystander cells. bystander cells show distinct cytokine and cleaved caspase-3 phenotypes compared with infected cells during DENV infection. bystander cells show similar DC surface marker phenotypes compared with infected cells during deNV infection. the cells were stratified as DENV-infected (I) cells (filled circles) or bystander (B) cells (open circles) the percentage of mock, bystander, or DENV-infected cells of DENV-2 (green) and DENV-4 samples stained positive intracellularly for the cytokines (A) TNF-, (B) IL-1, (C) IL-8, and (D) IP-10. IL-6, IL-1, IL-12, MIP-1, MIP-1, RANTES, and IL-8) compared with mock and DENV-2 infection. DENV-4 infection of DCs induces greater cytokine and chemokine secretion compared with DENV-2 infection. the observed differences in cytokine and chemokine production by DENV-2 and DENV-4 could be due to the different proportion of infected cells in the culture between the two viruses. cytokine and chemokine secretion for DENV-2 infection was generally MOI dependent, with greater cytokine and chemokine secretion at the higher MOI. this is the first study to utilize CyTOF to examine cells infected with a hemorrhagic fever virus. this is the first study to utilize CyTOF to examine cells infected with a hemorrhagic fever virus. this strain is also more capable of activating human DCs, upregulating DC migration markers, and inducing cytokine production compared with this DENV-2 strain. the most 5\u2032 region of the DENV 3\u2032 untranslated region is one of the least conserved regions of the DENV genome among the serotypes (46). the most 5\u2032 region of the DENV 3\u2032 untranslated region is one of the least conserved regions of the DENV genome among the serotypes (46) different DENV sfRNA species accumulate in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts during host change, with subsequent implications for innate immune induction and viral fitness. the viSNE analysis in this study is elucidating because it shows that the DCs producing the highest amount of cytokines are largely distinct from those upregulating the highest amount of DC activation markers during DENV infection. data also show that type I IFN is secreted at higher levels during DENV-4 infection of DCs as compared with DENV-2 infection of DCs. bystander cells should be unable to block IFN signaling, since they do not contain DENV NS5 protein, which degrades STAT2 in infected cells. cells undergoing apoptosis may release viral progeny, contributing to virus spreading, or may release apoptotic bodies later engulfed by other DCs. loss of DENV-infected DCs by apoptosis could impair the connection between innate and adaptive immunity and diminish the human immune response to DENV infection. both infected and bystander DCs are then able to migrate to draining lymph nodes and interact with T cells (57). bystander cells could also have been abortively infected or could have captured DENV antigens via phagocytosis of exosomes containing DENV antigens. aedes aegypti cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in -MEM GlutaMAX. they were supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES. these tissue culture reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. a prototypic DENV-2 strain belonging to the Asian I genotype (Supplemental Figure 2) that was isolated from a patient with dengue shock syndrome in Thailand in 1964. a DENV-4 strain belonging to genotype IIB (Supplemental Figure 1) that was isolated from a patient with dengue fever in Indonesia in 1976 (DENV-4 1036) were used in this study. a set of 10 primer pairs was designed based on the sequence of available DENV-4 complete genomes. each primer included the sequence of universal primers M13-fwd or M13-rev. RT-PCR was performed using the superscript III high-fidelity RT-PCR kit.
