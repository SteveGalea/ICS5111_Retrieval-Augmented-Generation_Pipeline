{"summary": "HPeV is structurally similar to other picornaviruses because of its icosahedral symmetry and appearance on electron microscopy. it was first described in 1961 as echoviruses 22 and 23 of the genus Enterovirus on the basis of serology and clinical presentation on identification from an outbreak of diarrhea among children. however, further studies showed that properties of the virus, such as nucleotide sequence in replication and translation elements, differ from other members of the genus Enter id is not further cleaved to generate the capsid proteins VP4 and VP2. HPeV differs from members of the genus Enterovirus by not shutting off host cell protein synthesis during replication. a large enterovirus surveillance in the united states from 1983. the most common genotype of HPeV in Europe is HPeV1, followed by HPeV3 [15,21,22]. in japan, HPeVs were isolated from 0.3% of 13,656 clinical samples collected from 1991 to 2005. most infections of HPeVs are asymptomatic or clinically mild in severity in children > 5 years old and adults. HPeV3 differs from HPeV1 by lacking the RGD motif in VP1 so an alternative receptor may exist, thus changing the cellular tropism of HPeV3. the technique is not routinely detected in most laboratories because it grows poorly in culture, typing reagents are not widely available for new types, and the technique is laborious. T84 colon carcinoma cells (BCRC: 60149) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% and 10% FBS. IFN-2a and IFN-2a were used for virus inhibition assays. cDNA was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, then centrifuged at 7,500 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. after removal of supernatant, it was air dried for 10 min in a laminar flow hood. cDNA was synthesized with a 50 mM random primer with 1 g total RNA in a total reaction volume of 12 l. HPeV type 2 strain Williamson (accession no. AJ005695); HPeV type 3 strains can82853-01 (accession no. AJ889918) and A308/99 (accession no. AB084913); HPeV type 4 strains K251176-02 (accession no. DQ315670) and Fuk2005-123 (accession no. AB433629); HPeV type 5 strains T92 new Zealand rabbits were vaccinated with pep VP0-21 peptide in six boosts over 2 months. at 7 days after last boost, immunized rabbit serum containing anti-HPeV1 VP0 antibody was harvested and peptide affinity-purified. phospho-IRF3 (pS386) (#2562-1, Epitomics), phospho-STAT1 (phospho-Tyr701) (GTX50118, GeneTex), STAT1 (phospho cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. harvested cells were incubated with primary antibody, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. images were acquired by using of biospectrum image system (UVP, Upland, CA) the HPeV1 KVP6 was isolated by the Virology Group, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. a549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, HeLa human cervical cancer cells, and J774A.1 mouse macrophage cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RNA extraction, viral genome sequence and quantitative real-time PCR. cDNA was synthesized with a 50 mM random primer with 1 g total RNA in a total reaction volume of 12 l. the relative gene mRNA expression was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) as a loading control. random selected HPeV genome sequences for phylogenetic and similarity plots analysis were HPeV type 1 strains Harris (accession no. L02971), SH1 (accession no. FJ840477), and 7555312 (accession no. FM178558); similarity analysis involved the known full-length nucleotide sequences of HPeV1 to HPeV8 genomes against HPeV1 KVP6. new Zealand rabbits were vaccinated with pep VP0-21 peptide in six boosts over 2 months. cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-diami-dino-2-phenylindole (1 mg/ml, 1:100,000 dilution in PBS) after three washes with PBS, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. cell proliferation assay WST-1 assay (Roche) was used to monitor cell proliferation. pRL-TK (Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase under an HSV thymidine kinase promoter, was an internal control. luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. genome organization of HPeV1 KVP6 is identical to that of other HPeVs. full genome alignment showed that HPeV1 KVP6 shared the highest nucleotide sequence homology, 87%, with the HPeV1 strain 7555312. however, HPeV1 KVP6 shared 97% amino acid homology with other HPeV isolates. similar findings were noted in the phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural regions. the cell tropism of HPeV1 was measured by immunofluorescence assay with anti-VP0 antibody. several cell types were infected with HPeV1 for 6 h at multiplicity of infection = 1. the cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral genome are changed during viral amplification, we propagated the HPeV1 KVP6 virus from the 4th progeny (P4) in vero cells with serial sub-passaging. no CPE at post-infection day 10 in P5 infected cells, which might due to the extremely low virion production. RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA level of HPeV1 structure-protein (VP1) positive sense (+) and negative sense (-) in A549 cells (2105, upper panels) and T84 cells (2105, lower panels) infected with HPeV1 (MOI = 1) RT-qPCR analyses of HPeV1 viral genes showed two peaks of positive- and negative-sense RNA gene expression of VP1. the first peak occurred at 6 hpi and the second but smaller surge at 72 or 96 hpi. however, the two peaks of VP1 replication in A549 cells were not found in T84 cells. the effect of incubation temperature on HPeV1 replication is unclear. if these phenomena are cell type-dependent, further investigation is needed. phospho-IRF3, total IRF3 and -actin expression in cells harvested from HPeV1 infected A549 cells (upper panels) and T84 cells (lower panels) or DBTRG-5MG cells (D) at indicated times and temperatures. polyI:C-induced IRF3 phosphorylation level was lower in 33\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C in A549 and T84 cells. more HPeV1 virions were produced in T84 than A549 cells at 33\u00b0C. the infection rate of HPeV1 was estimated by immunofluorescence assay. IFN-2a and IFN pretreatment reduced HPeV1 infection. but this effect was not shown with IFN post-treatment in A549 cells. red fluorescence of VP0 staining cells was quantified and calculated with DAPI nuclear staining signaling to show infectivity. data are mean SD from 3 observed fields. IFN induced the mRNA expression of antiviral-associated proteins such as Viperin, IRF7, PKR, MxA and MAVS. HPeV1 infection interfered in type I IFN signaling activation. complete genome of the HPeV1 virus contains 7,329 nucleotides. the predicted polyprotein is encoded by a 6,537-nt single ORF. genome organization of HPeV1 KVP6 is identical to that of other HPeVs. strain 7555312 and a mean of 77% identity with other HPeV isolates. at the polyprotein level, all isolates possessed a mean of 88% amino acid identity; however, HPeV1 KVP6 shared 97% amino acid homology with HPeV1 strain 7555312. similar findings were noted in the phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural regions. T84 cells (intestinal carcinoma), A549 cells (lung carcinoma cells) and DBTRG-5MG (glioblastoma cells) were susceptible to HPeV infection. BHK21 cells (baby hamster kindney epithelial cells) and J774A.1 cells (mouse macrophages) were not infected with HPeV1. gene mutation during virus passage was reported in hepatitis A and E virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) infection. mutation in nucleotide position 2984 adenosine was replaced by thymine. mutation in amino acid position 768 from Asparagine to Isoleucine may be of interest. HPeV1 structure-protein (VP1) positive sense (+) and negative sense (-) in A549 cells (2105, upper panels) and T84 cells (2105, lower panels) infected with HPeV1 (MOI = 1). RT-qPCR analyses of HPeV1 viral genes showed two peaks of positive-. the two-peaks of VP1 replication in A549 cells were not found in T84 cells. the mRNA and protein expression of HPeV1 VP1 peaked at 6 hpi. the fold increase in VP1 RNA was lower in T84 than A549 cells. HPeV1 virion production was inhibited at 39\u00b0C incubation at 24 hpi in A549 and T84 cells. HPeV1 infection with 6-h short-term incubation at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C retained the infectivity of the positive control. RT-qPCR analysis of IFN and IFN mRNA expression in A549 or T84 cells (2105) infected by HPeV1 (MOI = 1) or stimulated by poly I:C (2 g) at indicated times. data are mean SD from 3 independent tests. Virus-mediated IRF3 activation was ambiguous at all three culture temperatures in T84 cells. more HPeV1 virions produced in T84 than A549 cells at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. we measured the level of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. compared with T84 cells, A549 showed that IFN-2a and IFN induced higher levels of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1. 49 and T84 cells (2105) were treated with IFN-2a or IFN (1000 U/ml) for 24 h before HPeV1 infection (MOI = 1). data are mean SD. Student t test, * p0.05, ** p0.01 compared with control. the evasion of an antiviral mechanism would be important for HPeV1 replication. HPeV1 downregulates type I IFN activity. recombination of HPeV1 virus may be associated with HPeV evolution and pathogenesis. in vitro study showed impaired HPeV1 replication at 39\u00b0C culture so physically high temperature restricts HPeV1 replication. the VP1 C-terminus of most HPeVs contained the RGD receptor-binding domain, which is critical for cell entry. previous reports indicated frequent recombination among HPeV1, -4, -5 and -6 but more restricted among HPeV3 strains. the innate immune response of type I IFN is initiated in host cells. the transcription of type I IFN is rapidly induced via cooperative binding to its promoter by three families of transcription factors. the secreted IFN acts on neighboring cells and activates the STAT pathway via type I IFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression. poliovirus, enterovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, hepatitis A virus, rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus B3 can block RIG-I-, MDA5- and MAVS-mediated type I IFN production by viral protease activity [56,57,58,59,60,61] the most frequent breaking points for recombination flanked the capsid-encoding region [35,36,47]. recombination at this position could thus have important evolutionary mechanisms in HPeVs [35,36]. we found that HPeV1 infectivity was retained at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C but impaired at 39\u00b0C incubation before cell inoculation. the innate immune response of type I IFN is rapidly induced via cooperative binding to its promoter by three families of transcription factors. poliovirus, enterovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, hepatitis A virus, rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus B3 can block RIG-I-, MDA5- and MAVS-mediated type I IFN production in T84 cells. the positive controls (upper panels of A, B) are cells infected with HPeV1 without pre-incubation. polyI:C stimulates IRF3 activation at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C incubation.
