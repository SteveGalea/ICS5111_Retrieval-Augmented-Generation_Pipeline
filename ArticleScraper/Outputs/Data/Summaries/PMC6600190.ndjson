{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an RNA virus that belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales. the PRRSV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA approximately 15 kb in length. nsp1 and nsp1 are the most potent IFN antagonists (8, 10) nsp1 is a multifunctional protein playing roles in viral genome replication (16), nsp2TF translational frame shifting (4), and type I IFN suppression. nsp1 blocks the nuclear export of host mRNAs to the cytoplasm and thus inhibition of host innate immunity (19). Mutations in the nsp1 SAP motif conferred clinical attenuation of PRRSV in pigs (17, 18, 23), indicating that the inhibition of host mRNA export contributes to PRRSV virulence. the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins and RNAs is a critical process for many cellular functions. the N-terminal aa 1-to-327 region of Nup62 is rich in FG repeats and functions as a docking site for nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) and for nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) the region interacts with a distinct subset of nuclear transport receptors for nucleocytoplasmic transport or with other Nups to facilitate the anchoring of nup62 to the NPC via its coiled-coil structure (35\u201341) the mechanism for different viruses may vary, but the outcomes are similar, leading to suppression of the host antiviral defense and the increase of viral replication. we investigated the molecular basis of the inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export and its biological consequences. no distinct changes were observed in the distribution or degradation of ALY and NXF1 or in their colocalization with nsp1. the nup62 gene was cloned with a hemagglutinin tag at its N terminus to facilitate detection. arrows indicate colocalization of nsp1 and HA-Nup62. cells were stained with anti-PRRSV-nsp1 and anti-Nup62 antibodies. a mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed (66, 67) since the N protein of PRRSV forms homodimers (67), N was included as a positive control. cells were transfected with respective genes, along with p5XGal4tk-luciferase as a reporter and pRL-TK Renilla plasmid as an internal control. expression of GST-nsp1 fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pGEX-4T3 or pGEX-4T3-nsp1. cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. cell lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS-10% PAGE. the N-terminal aa 1 to 327 representing the FG-rich and Thr-rich linker region (Nup62-N) and the C-terminal aa 328 to 522 representing the coiled-coil domain (Nup62-C) were constructed and examined for their binding to nsp1. pVP16-Nup62-C increased luciferase activity significantly (P = 0.000813) amino acids 328 to 522 of Nup62 contain binding domain for nsp1. luciferase assay using pM-nsp1, pVP16-Nup62, pVP16-Nup62-N, or pVP16-Nup62-C. whole-cell lysates were probed with anti-HA MAb (top gel) or anti-FLAG PAb (bottom gels). -Actin served as a loading control. nup62-nsp1 interaction determines host mRNA nuclear export. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and subjected to ISH. cells were stained with DAPI and stained with -FLAG MAb (green) and -HA MAb (red) cell lysates were prepared and resolved in SDS-10% PAGE. asterisks indicate GST, GST-nsp1 or its mutant proteins. the precipitates were incubated with HeLa cell lysates. the binding of nsp1 to nup62 was the basis for nsp1-mediated host mRNA nuclear retention. nsp1 showed the greatest impact on inducible-gene expression, intermediate impact on regular gene expression, and neglectable impact on housekeeping gene expression. total mRNAs for IFN- and IFN- were decreased by nsp1. this was probably due to the fact that nsp1 impaired IFN production by inhibiting IRF3 activation and nuclear translocation. nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic factors involved in various signaling pathways. g of nsp1 genes and stimulated with PIC (0.5 g/ml) were isolated separately. relative amounts of the respective mRNAs were calculated by normalizing the values to that of total GAPDH. 3D4/21 cells were transfected with the nsp1 gene for 24 h and stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. total cytoplasmic RNAs were isolated, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted. viral effectors\u2014sPKR, sOAS, sMx1, sISG15, sIFIT1 and sIFIT2\u2014were reduced in the cytoplasm of nsp1-expressing cells. these results demonstrate that nsp1 decreased the amounts of antiviral mRNAs, and thus, the antiviral host response would be suppressed. absolute gray intensities were quantified using the FluroChem R system. relative intensities were normalized using -actin. the data represent the results from one of two independent experiments. mutant PRRSV vL126A mutant virus was first examined for inability to disintegrate Nup62 in infected cells. vL126A mutant virus was first examined for inability to disintegrate Nup62 in infected cells. expression promoted the growth of lelystad virus (LV), as well as the prototype of PRRSV-1. we chose porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is in the same order as PRRSV and because PEDV readily infects MARC-145 cells (75). PEDV growth was enhanced in nsp1-expressing MARC-145 cells. the supernatants were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi for PRRSV (B to D) or at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hpi for PEDV (E) titers were determined by plaque assay for PRRSV (B to D) or TCID50 for PEDV (E) nup62-specfic small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment reduced Nup62 expression to 37% and 43% at 24 h and 48 h posttransfection. control siRNA (siControl) did not affect Nup62 expression. nsp1 subunits of PRRSV, LDV, and SHFV colocalized with Nup62. nsp1 subunits of different arteriviruses did not cause reduced staining. only PRRSV nsp1, LDV nsp1, and SHFV nsp1 precipitated HA-Nup62. the images were taken by confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) the whole-cell lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG MAb. the whole-cell lysates were probed to indicate the expression of each protein. the nup62 gene was cloned with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N terminus. staining was seen in pXJ41, nsp1 and N gene-transfected cells. the staining was evident in pXJ41, nsp1 and N gene-transfected cells. arrows indicate colocalization of F-nsp1 and HA-Nup62. cells were stained with anti-PRRSV-nsp1 PAb (red) and -Nup62 MAb (green) coexpression of pM-nsp1 and pVP16-Nup62 increased reporter activity. similar results were obtained using an alternative promoter. similar results were obtained using an alternative promoter. the GST or GST-nsp1 protein was immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. protein precipitates were subjected to Western blotting using anti-Nup62. nup62-N and nup62-C were examined first in the mammalian two-hybrid system. when coexpressed with pM-nsp1, pVP16-Nup62-C increased luciferase activity significantly. pVP16-Nup62-C increased luciferase activity significantly. two-hybrid luciferase assay using pM-nsp1, pVP16-Nup62, pVP16-Nup62-N, or pVP16-Nup62-C. cells were transfected with p5XGal4SV40-luciferase and pRL-TK. we identified a SAP motif in the PLP1 region of nsp1. we showed that leucine 126 (L126) within this domain was critical for the nuclear retention of host mRNA. lysine 124 (K124) has been shown to be nonessential for nsp1 function. cells were cotransfected with HA-Nup62 and nsp1 or its mutants. arrows indicate colocalization of nsp1 and Nup62. images were taken by confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) GST, GST-nsp1, or its mutant proteins were coupled with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. the precipitates were subjected to Western blotting using -Nup62 MAb. nsp1 to nup62 was the basis for nsp1-mediated host mRNA nuclear retention. mRNAs for inducible-gene expression showed the highest nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio after stimulation. mRNAs for other genes, including DEPTOR, NOL6, SH2, and -actin, showed lower nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios. nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic factors involved in various signaling pathways. nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF3, p65, and STAT1 and STAT2 for IFN production, NF-B signaling, and IFN signaling pathways. nsp1-overexpressing cells were transfected with pXJ41, F-nsp1, F-nsp1, or F-nsp1-L126A plasmids. they were stimulated with poly(IC) (0.5 g/ml) (C), TNF- (20 ng/ml) (D), or IFN- (1,000 U/ml) (E and F) poly(IC) stimulation increased amounts of the sIFN- and sIFN- mRNAs in pXJ41-transfected cells. the mutant L126A did not inhibit host mRNA nuclear export to the cytoplasm by nsp1. the mutant L126A did not inhibit host mRNA nuclear export to the cytoplasm. 3D4/21 cells were transfected with 2 g of pXJ41, nsp1 or nsp1-L126A plasmid for 24 h and stimulated with PIC by transfection. cytoplasmic RNAs were isolated for RT-qPCR analysis. error bars represent means and SD (n = 3). the y axes represent the ratios compared to pXJ41. the error bars represent means and SD (n = 2). vL126A mutant virus was first examined for inability to disintegrate Nup62 in infected cells. titers of wild-type PRRSV FL13 were detectable as early as 6 h postinfection. nsp1 overexpression promoted growth of lelystad virus (LV) PEDV growth was enhanced in nsp1-expressing MARC-145 cells. peak titer was also higher in these cells than in mock-transfected or L126-expressing cells. inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking by nsp1 broadly confers benefits. the error bars represent means SD (n = 2). at each time point, mean titers marked with different lowercase letters indicate statistical significance (P 0.05) siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Nup62. vL126A grew poorly, with a peak titer of 2.8 log10 PFU/ml. in siControl-treated cells, the vL126A titer increased to 4.0 log10 PFU/ml. vL126A growth was rescued by depletion of Nup62. HFV nsp1 and SHFV nsp1 all did not cause reduced nuclear rim staining or colocalize with Nup62. only PRRSV nsp1, LDV nsp1, and SHFV nsp1 precipitated HA-Nup62. the nup62-nsp1-binding and colocalization data were consistent with the results on the inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export mediated by the nsp the whole-cell lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG MAb. the whole-cell lysates were probed to indicate the expression of each protein. -Actin was used as a loading control. luciferase assay, GST pulldown assay, and co-IP. further studies have shown the C-terminal residues 328 to 522 of Nup62 to be the nsp1-binding domain. it is plausible that nsp1 binding to nup62 disrupts the structural integrity of the NPC. the nsp1 proteins of PRRSV, LDV, SHFV, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) Lpro share high similarity in the PLP domain (76), which may explain their binding to Nup62. the biological consequence of the nsp1-Nup62 interaction has also been investigated. the vL126A mutant virus is attenuated in its growth in MARC-145 cells. the growth attenuation of vL126A can be rescued in cells overexpressing nsp1. this mechanism confers benefits on PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2 and another cytoplasmic RNA virus. vL126A is a mutant PRRS virus generated by replacing Leu at position 126 of nsp1 with Ala of the FL13 infectious clone (19, 79). vL126A is a mutant PRRSV-1 virus generated by replacing Leu at position 126 of nsp1 with Ala of the FL13 infectious clone.
