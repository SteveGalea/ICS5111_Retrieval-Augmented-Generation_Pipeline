{"summary": "FMD is caused by FMD virus (FMDV), which belongs to the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family (1, 2). the genome of FMDV is about 8.5 kb in length, with only one open reading frame (ORF) to encode a polyprotein. the viral polyprotein is processed into precursors and individual structural and nonstructural proteins later on (2, 3). tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK1/Tyk2)-mediated phosphorylation, STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus. they bind to IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the transcription complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3. ISGF3 in turn, sequence-specifically binds to an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) that is present in numerous type I I 3Cpro has been shown to cleave the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-B) essential modulator (NEMO) and impair the ability of NEMO to activate downstream IFN production. however, whether FMDV inhibits the type I IFN signaling pathway remains unclear. the plasmid pISRE-Luc contains ISRE binding sequence upstream of the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene. the plasmid contains the Renilla luciferase reporter under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) promoter. cDNAs encoding KPNA1, -2, -3, and -4 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) pXJ41-NS1 expressing swine influenza virus (SIV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and pXJ41-GST expressing glutathione S-transferase were used as positive and negative controls.

RNA was further purified by using an RNeasy Minikit. one microgram of purified RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase. 1 l cDNA was then used for SYBR green PCR assay. the values were normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase activities. the results were expressed as relative luciferase activities. all assays were repeated at least three times, with each experiment performed in triplicate. specific reaction products were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG (Boster, Wuhan, China) the membranes were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate according to the manufacturer's suggestions. cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then washed again three times with ice-cold PBS. the coverslips were then incubated with anti-STAT1 or STAT2 polyclonal Ab (1:1,000) and anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (MAb; cells were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 5 min at 5,000 g in a microcentrifuge. cell pellets were resuspended in cytosolic extraction buffer A. the pellets were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 5 min at 12,000 rpm. DNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) three fragments, A, B, and C, were individually PCR amplified with three pairs of PCR primers (FMDV-A-Fwd/FMDV-A-Rev, FMDV-B-Fwd, and FMDV-C-C-Rev) the first fragment A containing the T7 promoter was digested with AscI and NotI and clone BHK-21 cells grown to 80% confluence in six-well plates were transfected with 5 g of RNA and 10 l of DMRIE-C (1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxy ethyl ammonium bromide and cholesterol; Invitrogen) supernatants from cells at 48 h posttransfection were serially passaged on PK-15 cells. mRNA levels of ISG15, ISG56, Mx1, OAS, and PKR increased 24.7-, 339.9-, 534.2-, 43.2-, and 27.1-fold respectively. expression of 3Cpro showed a 2- to 4-fold greater inhibitory effect than 3ABC. but such an inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing 3A and 3B. pXJ41, pXJ41-GST, pXJ41-NS1, pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3A, pXJ41-3B, or pXJ41-3C were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- at 24 h posttransfection. pXJ41-GST and pXJ41-NS1 were used as negative and positive controls. 3A- and 3B-expressing cells induced luciferase activity at levels similar to those of the negative controls. however, the ISRE promoter activity in FMDV 3ABC-expressing cells was 5.1-fold lower than that in pXJ41-transfected cells. in 3Cpro-expressing cells it was approximately 8.6-fold lower than that in pXJ41-transfected cells. expression of 3ABC, 3A, 3B, or 3C protein in pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3A, pXJ41-3B, or pXJ41-3C was detected by Western blotting using FLAG or HA antibody. all assays were repeated at least three times, with each experiment performed in triplicates. the catalytic triad of H46, D84, and C163 of 3Cpro played essential roles in FMDV 3Cpro suppressing ISRE promoter activity. previous reports have shown that the catalytic triad of H46, D84, and C163 of 3Cpro played essential roles in its enzyme activity. luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted as described above. expression of 3Cpro was also shown. lysates from 3Cpro-expressing cells were subjected to Western blotting using phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT2 antibodies. FMDV 3Cpro did not alter the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2 after IFN- stimulation. antibody followed by immunoblotting with STAT2-Y690 antibody showed the presence of phosphorylated STAT2 in the samples. no obvious difference was observed between the IFN-treated cells transfected with pXJ41 and pXJ41-3C. STAT1 translocated to the nucleus in 90.0% of pXJ41-transfected cells. pXJ41-transfected cells or cells expressing WT 3Cpro without stimulation were treated with IFN- at 18 h posttransfection. cell staining with STAT2 antibody showed results similar to those with STAT1 antibody. FMDV 3Cpro inhibits nuclear translocation of STAT1. cells were transfected with pXJ41, pXJ41-3C, or individual mutants of pXJ41-3C. 76.0% of STAT1-Y701 and 79.0% of STAT2-Y690 were detected in the nuclear fraction of pXJ41-transfected cells. only 25.0% and 26.0% of STAT1-Y701 and 29.0% and 28.0% of STAT2-Y690 were detected in the nuclear fraction of cells expressing the mutant. the fractionation results are in line with the observation from IFAs. the catalytic triad H46, D84, and C163 of 3Cpro are critical for 3Cpro-mediated inhibition of STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. these results are consistent with our earlier observation that the catalytically inactive 3Cpro mutants lost their capacity to suppress ISRE promoter activities. the protease activity of FMDV 3Cpro was critical for blocking STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. we examined whether KPNA1 was degraded in cells expressing 3Cpro. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed, and Western blotting was done individually with antibody against FLAG, HA, or -actin. AG antibody shown as the relative protein expression levels, normalized with -actin. blotting with KPNA1 was shown as the relative protein expression levels, normalized with -actin. pXJ41, pXJ41-3C, or individual mutants of pXJ41-3C were transfected. the endogenous KPNA1 was examined by Western blotting. the results may explain why the 3Cpro and 3Cpro mutants prevent STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. endogenous KPNA1 levels in FMDV-infected cells were reduced at 12 hpi. these results were consistent with the observation in cells expressing 3Cpro in gene transfection experiments. PK-15 cells were harvested at 24 hpi for Western blotting. pXJ41, pXJ41-GST, pXJ41-NS1, pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3ABC, pXJ41-3A, pXJ41-3B, or pXJ41-3B. pXJ41-NS1 was used as a positive control. mRNA levels of ISG15, ISG56, Mx1, OAS, and PKR increased 24.7-, 339.9-, 534.2-, 43.2-, and 27.1-fold respectively. expression of 3Cpro showed a 2- to 4-fold greater inhibitory effect than 3ABC. expression of 3Cpro showed a 2-fold greater inhibitory effect than 3ABC. 3ABC of FMDV is eventually cleaved into 3A, 3B, and 3Cpro (2). it is 3Cpro which contributes to 3ABC inhibiting the transcript levels of ISGs. expression of SIV NS1 significantly inhibited ISG mRNA synthesis. pXJ41-NS1 was used as a positive control, and pXJ41 and pXJ41-GST were used as negative controls. the ISRE promoter activity in FMDV 3ABC-expressing cells was 5.1-fold lower than that in pXJ41-transfected cells. in 3Cpro-expressing cells it was approximately 8.6-fold lower than that in pXJ41-NS1. pXJ41-GST and pXJ41-NS1 were used as negative and positive controls. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were incubated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN-. expression of 3ABC, 3A, 3B, or 3C protein was detected by Western blotting using FLAG or HA antibody. pXJ41-3B, or pXJ41-3C, was detected by Western blotting using FLAG or HA antibody. the data represent the means of three independent experiments, with each experiment performed in triplicate. 3Cpro cells were transfected with pXJ41, pXJ41-3C, or individual mutants of pXJ41-3C and 0.5 g of pISRE-Luc. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were incubated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 16 h. the data represent the means of three independent experiments. cells were either left untreated () or treated (+) with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 1 h. same blot was incubated with -actin antibody as a protein loading control. FMDV 3Cpro does not alter the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2 after IFN- stimulation. the data suggest that the heterodimerization of STAT1 and STAT2 in 3Cpro-expressing cells is not remarkably affected. pXJ41-transfected cells or cells expressing WT 3Cpro without stimulation showed efficient translocation to the nucleus. the majority of the STAT1 remained in the cytoplasm of cells expressing WT 3Cpro and the 3Cpro-H205R mutant even after IFN- treatment. fected cells or cells expressing WT 3Cpro without IFN- stimulation, STAT1 translocated to the nucleus in 90.0% of pXJ41-transfected cells. in 3Cpro-expressing and 3Cpro-H205R mutant-expressing cells, STAT1 translocated to the nucleus only in 10.0% and 9.0% of cells, respectively. cell staining with STAT2 antibody showed results similar to those with STAT1 antibody. antibodies against STAT1-Y701 and STAT2-Y690 were used to detect the presence of the phosphorylated proteins in those fractions. in pXJ41-transfected cells, more STAT1-Y701 and STAT2-Y690 were found in the nuclear fraction than in the cytoplasmic fraction after IFN- treatment. in H46Y, D84N, and C163G mutated 3Cpro-expressing cells after IFN- treatment 77.0%, 76.5%, and 77.2% of STAT1-Y701 and 78.5%, 78.8%, and 79.5% of STAT2-Y690, respectively, were detected in the nuclear fraction of cells expressing the WT 3Cpro and 3Cpro-H205R mutants. the band intensities of each fraction are shown as the relative percentages of the total density of corresponding cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. normalization for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was done with HSP90 and PARP, respectively. western blotting was done individually with antibody against FLAG, HA, or -actin. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with the cell lysis buffer supplemented with PMSF. cells were harvested 6 h later, and the endogenous KPNA1 was examined. neither MG132 nor zVAD-FMK inhibited 3Cpro-mediated KPNA1 degradation. we then examined whether the protease activity of 3Cpro induced KPNA1 degradation directly. the band intensities of blotting with KPNA1 antibody are shown as the relative protein expression levels, normalized with -actin. data represent the means the standard deviations (error bars) of three experiments. PK-15 cells were harvested at 24 hpi for Western blotting using antibody against KPNA1, mouse anti-3C serum, or -actin. the data presented here are results from one experiment of three Western blotting experiments. FMDV 3Cpro interferes with the IFN signaling pathway by degrading KPNA1 and thus blocking STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. previous studies have demonstrated that FMDV 3Cpro inhibits the production pathway of type I IFN (24) 3Cpro blocks STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation, and protease activity of 3Cpro is associated with the inhibition of STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. multiple levels of regulation occur during ISGF3 translocation to the nucleus. degradation was specifically attributable to protease activity of FMDV 3Cpro. mutants did not prevent STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. degradation of endogenous KPNA1 was shown in PK-15 cells. our results provide a new insight into how viral proteins of FMDV function as inhibitors of type I IFN signaling."}
