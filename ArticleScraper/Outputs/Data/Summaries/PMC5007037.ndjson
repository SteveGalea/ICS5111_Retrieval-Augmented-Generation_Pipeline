{"summary": "antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) engage other innate immune cells as effectors to clear infected host cells, immune complexes, and opsonized virus. innate immune cells also influence downstream adaptive immune response by stimulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. antibody effector functions are important not only for vaccination, but also for cure and passive immunotherapy strategies revolving around the delivery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) recent passive immunization trials show that their protective activity is not solely due to neutralization, but also in part due to Fc-mediated function. antibodies mediating antibody-dependent internalization show greater breadth of activity against heterologous strains compared with neutralizing antibodies. antibody-mediated phagocytosis may play a role in preventing mucosal HIV-1 transmission. impaired phagocytosis is one of the hallmarks of chronic HIV-1 infection. differences in antibody physiological localization may also play a role. phagocytic activity is likely to vary depending on the FcR and antibody subclass involved. antibody-mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions does not require neutralization. antibody isotype/subclass profiles may differ due to differing potencies in antibody-mediated phagocytosis. the findings raise the hypothesis that antibody isotype/subclass profiles may differ in their protective efficacy due to differences in antibody-mediated phagocytosis. immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (VH) and light-chain (VL) gene segments were de novo synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector containing full length IgG1, IgG3, IgA1 or IgA2 constant region genes. supernatants were harvested after 4\u20135 days using polyethyleneimine (PEI, Polysciences Inc.) cubation at 37\u00b0C and 8% CO2, concentrated, and affinity purified by protein G or peptide M chromatography per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. wild-type IgG1 antibodies designated IgG_SEK were produced based on the IgG3 heavy chain constant region coding sequence. sCD4 blocking was performed in order to reduce background levels of virus internalization due to Env-CD4 interactions. antigens/viruses and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour for phagocytosis/virion internalization. a background level of phagocytosis was determined based on the mean + 3 standard deviations (SD) of non-HIV-specific antibodies. a range of phagocytosis scores between 2 and 20 were obtained. similar results were obtained with control antibodies and replicating key phagocytosis experiments. the instrument was controlled by Data Acquisition 9.0 software (Fort\u00e9bio) two sets of 8 biosensors were regenerated in glycine buffer pH 2.0. then, CH31 IgG1 or IgG3 and the respective CH65 IgG1 or IgG3 at 10 g/mL were separately loaded on a set of 8 anti-human IgG Fc Capture biosensors. traction of negative control CH65 IgG1_SEK and CH65 IgG3 to exclude non-specific binding interactions. similar results were obtained for association and dissociation without negative control subtraction. iVirion = 100- flow-through infectivity / virus no-Ab infectivity) x 100%. rVirion = [captured viral RNA copies / (captured viral RNA + flow-through viral RNA) x 100%. separate assays using the same primary monocyte donor were averaged and treated as a single data point. all subjects were consented following 45 CFR 46. no minors were recruited into this study. immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (VH) and light-chain (VL) gene segments were de novo synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector containing full length IgG1, IgG3, IgA1 or IgA2 constant region genes. supernatants were harvested after 4\u20135 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C on a rotator. 8% CO2, concentrated, and affinity purified by protein G or peptide M chromatography per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. wild-type IgG1 antibodies designated IgG_SEK were produced based on the IgG3 heavy chain constant region coding sequence M12958_X03604. sCD4 blocking was performed in order to reduce background levels of virus internalization due to Env-CD4 interactions. blocking was achieved by pre-treating cells at 10 x106 cells/ml with 20 g/ml anti-human CD4 antibody (clone SK3) for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C before adding them to the antibody-beads/virus mixture. ness of the assay was confirmed by multiple scientists. we have obtained a range of phagocytosis scores between 2 to 20. ness of the assay dynamic range is determined by a division of the antibody-dependent internalization components. the instrument was controlled by Data Acquisition 9.0 software (Fort\u00e9bio) two sets of 8 biosensors were regenerated in glycine buffer pH 2.0. then, CH31 IgG1 or IgG3 and the respective CH65 IgG1 or IgG3 at 10 g/mL were separately loaded on a set of 8 Anti-Human IgG Fc Capture (AHC) biosensors. IgG1_SEK and CH65 IgG3 from. CH31 IgG1_SEK and CH31 IgG3 respectively to exclude non-specific binding interactions. similar results obtained for association and dissociation without negative control subtraction. total virions captured (rVirion) were calculated independently with different denominators. iVirion = [(100- flow-through infectivity) / (virus no-Ab infectivity)] x 100%. rVirion = [captured viral RNA copies / (captured viral RNA + flow-through viral RNA) x 100%. HIV-1 IgA mediates phagocytosis of beads and virions in primary monocytes through FcRI. antibody-mediated internalization of virions exert antiviral activity for a number of pathogens. representative histograms of bead uptake by THP-1 cells for CD4bs bNAb CH31 mIgA2 and negative control anti-influenza mAb phagocytosis activity are shown. red traces represent antibody-mediated internalization of beads, while the black trace represents background internalization of beads in the absence of antibody. anti-CD89-mediated blocking of antibody-mediated phagocytosis was quantified by taking the difference in phagocytosis score. we hypothesized that THP-1 cells might express a different Fc receptor profile compared to primary monocytes. IgA-mediated phagocytosis activity was much higher when primary monocytes were the phagocytes in the assay instead of THP-1 cells. non-HIV-1 antibody, CH65 mIgA2 [57], did not mediate phagocytosis of HIV-1 Env-coated beads. bead size was reduced to 0.2 m, a size closer to that of HIV virions. 91.5% blocking of phagocytosis was observed with 5 g/ml of anti-CD89 mAb. so, HIV-1 IgA-mediated phagocytosis in primary monocytes is largely mediated by FcRI. mIgA1, mIgA2 and IgG1 mediates greater phagocytosis than mIgA1 and mIgA2 for virions but not for beads. flow cytometry analyses the uptake of immune complexes by primary monocytes. both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were capable of internalizing HIV-1 virions in an antibody-specific manner (S1A and S1B Fig). both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were capable of internalizing HIV-1 virions in an antibody-specific manner (S1A and S1B Fig). IgG3 showed a non-significant trend toward higher phagocytosis of conSgp140-conjugated 1m beads (median phagocytosis score 14.1) compared CH31 IgG1 (median 10.2). 3.8-fold higher phagocytosis score than CH31 IgG1 (median phagocytosis score 4.6) anti-influenza mAb CH65 in each subclass backbone were also tested as negative controls. the differences in phagocytosis score were compared using a Sign test (D) different antibody isotypes/subclasses was caused by the ability to bind HIV-1 envelope, CH31 IgG1 and IgG3 were tested for their binding to HIV-192Th023 gp120 protein by biolayer interferometry. similar results were obtained with and without subtraction of negative control CH65 IgG3 and IgG1 non-specific binding respectively, since non-specific binding levels of CH65 to HIV-192Th023 gp120 antigen were low IgG3 showed greater virion internalization than CH31 IgG1 and CH31 mIgA1, with higher mean intensity in the virus fluorescence channel (10.5 x 103, 6.8 x 103, and 5.1 x 103 MFI, respectively) values for all CH31 antibodies remained above all negative controls. the percentage of fluorescence intensity comparing the 5-pixel-eroded image to the original image is shown for each CH31 antibody form. a mask determined by the ImageStream IDEAS Spot Wizard algorithm was applied, representing the areas with peak brightness defined by a spot-to-background ratio of 2.0. the percentage of fluorescence lost as the image was eroded was consistent across antibody isotypes/subclasses. image stream analysis confirms the antibody-mediated internalization of virus particles. the number of viral foci per cell was counted using the image stream. IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were produced for multiple epitope specificities. we tested these antibodies for phagocytosis of HIV-192TH023-Tomato virions. no differences were found between the two IgG1 forms. IgG3 has significantly higher phagocytosis potency than IgG1_SEK across multiple epitopes. IgG3 has enhanced phagocytosis potency across multiple HIV-1 epitopes. mucosal IgG from vaginal wecks could mediate virion internalization. we isolated IgG from 14 HIV-1+ women to test for virion capture. gp41, gp120, gp140, the V1/V2 loop, and the CD4 binding site. mucosal IgG from HIV-1+ individuals can mediate internalization of infectious HIV-1. mucosal IgG from vaginal wecks from HIV-1+ women can capture virions and mediate internalization of infectious HIV-1BaL. the ability of mucosal IgG in chronically infected women to mediate virus capture and virion internalization was quantified. blue circles represent phagocytosis scores for HIV-1BaL-Tomato virions in THP-1 cells. green squares represent virus capture percentages as measured by RT-qPCR. immune complexes were prepared in vitro by mixing IgA with 1 m fluorescent beads. the uptake of IgA-ConSgp140 immune complexes was analysed by flow cytometry. anti-CD89-mediated blocking of antibody-mediated phagocytosis was quantified by taking the difference in phagocytosis score between experiments conducted in the presence of 5 g/ml and 0 g/ml anti-CD89 (F) results from 3 independent experiments are shown. both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes expressed very low levels of the IgG receptor CD16 (FcRIII) both THP-1 cells expressed 2.5-fold higher levels of FcRII (CD32) than primary monocytes (median MFI 1.6 x104 and 6.2 x103 respectively) anti-human CD89 blocking abrogated phagocytosis in monocytes. 91.5% blocking of phagocytosis was observed with 5 g/ml of anti-CD89 mAb. all three forms of CH31 mAb mediated similar levels of phagocytosis of conSgp140CFI-conjugated fluorescent beads in primary monocytes. mIgG1 mediates greater phagocytosis than mIgA1 and mIgA2 for virions but not for beads. both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were capable of internalizing HIV-1 virions in an antibody-specific manner (S1A and S1B Fig). both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were capable of internalizing HIV-1 virions in an antibody-specific manner (S1A and S1B Fig). IgG3 is more potent than IgG1 for HIV-1 Bead and Virion Internalization. the broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibody CH31 [55] was generated in different Fc backbones as recombinant IgG1 (wild-type SEK) or IgG3 (wild-type), and the resulting antibodies were compared for potency in internalization of conSgp140-conjugated 1m beads. wild type CH31 IgG3 and IgG1 were tested for internalization of conSgp140-conjugated 1 m fluorescent beads (N = 8 independent experiments representing 6 different donors) (A), HIV-1BaL-Tomato virions (N = 19 independent experiments representing 11 different donors) and HIV-192TH023-Tomato virions (C) in human primary monocytes. association rate (kon), and dissociation rate (koff) are shown for 3 independent experiments (G), and their respective median values are also shown (H). if the variance in the virion internalization by different antibody isotypes/subclasses was caused by the ability to bind HIV-1 envelope, CH31 IgG1 and IgG3 were tested for their binding to HIV-192Th023 gp120 protein. the phagocytosis assay was set up similar to previous experiments. fixed cells were visualized on an ImageStream cytometer. we observed internalization of virus within monocytes, seen as distinct intracellular fluorescent puncta. internal virus fluorescence was quantified using the mean fluorescence intensity of all single, focused cell images for each antibody. the percentage of fluorescence intensity comparing the 5-pixel-eroded image to the original image is shown for each CH31 antibody form. a mask determined by the ImageStream IDEAS Spot Wizard algorithm was applied. escence excluded after erosion compared to internal probes. the pattern observed between antibodies isotypes and subclasses remained unchanged. imagestream analysis confirms antibody-mediated internalization of virus particles. IgG3 mediates Enhanced Phagocytosis Across multiple HIV-1 epitopes. gp41 principal immunodominant domain (gp41 PID), a gp41 conformational epitope, the V1/V2 loop, the CD4 binding site core, and the C1 conformational epitope. 23-tomato virions (median phagocytosis scores 2.0 to 3.1) compared to their IgG1 counterparts. IgG3 has significantly higher phagocytosis potency than IgG1_SEK across multiple epitopes. the differences in phagocytosis score were compared between IgG1_SEK and IgG3 using a linear mixed effects model. we then tested whether HIV-1 specific mucosal IgG from the female genital tract could mediate virion internalization. we previously reported the capacity of mucosal IgG from vaginal wecks to bind infectious virions. purified IgG from these four participants captured 47\u201361% of total HIV-1BaL virus particles. human mucosal IgG from HIV-1+ individuals can mediate virion capture and internalization of infectious HIV-1. the ability of mucosal IgG in chronically infected women to mediate uptake of HIV-1BaL-Tomato virions was quantified by flow cytometry. blue circles represent phagocytosis scores for HIV-1BaL-Tomato virions in THP-1 cells (N = 2 independent experiments), while green squares represent virus capture percentages as measured by RT-qPCR. we identified significant differences in IgA, IgG1 and IgG3 in mediating virion internalization. a previous report of improved protective functions for IgA1 over IgA2 was determined with antibodies specific for the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. further work is needed to understand if the structure of the IgA is beneficial for some, but not all, epitope specificities and antiviral functions. IgG3 mediated phagocytic function supports findings in both virus controllers and in RV144 vaccinees [4, 5] that this antibody response is associated with a more functional antibody profile. however, unlike Chung et al. who concluded that IgG3 may only be a surrogate of a functional IgG1 response. IgG3 shows stronger binding to several Fc receptors [48]. no difference in virion internalization was observed between CH31 IgG1_SEK and CH31 IgG1_AAA antibodies. this is consistent with the known low expression of FcRIII. mucosal IgG purified from vaginal wecks of HIV-1 infected women mediated phagocytosis of virions. mucosal IgG purified from vaginal wecks of HIV-1 infected women mediated phagocytosis of virions. a larger study is required to examine the relationship between antibody epitope specificity and virion internalization. we found a similar dichotomy between smaller and larger particles. smaller particles including 0.2 m beads, 40 nm beads, and HIV-1 virions (0.1 m) had higher phagocytosis scores in primary monocytes compared to THP-1 cells. larger particles (1 m beads) had higher phagocytosis scores in THP-1 cells compared to primary monocytes. HIV-1 virions and IgG Fc mediated antiviral activity can be active at the vaginal mucosa. these data provide fundamental insights on Fc mediated antibody effector functions that may be important for protection against HIV-1 acquisition. more than 1400 single, focused cells were acquired using an imageStreamX Mark II (EMD Millipore) AMNIS IDEAS software (v6.1) was used to analyze the images. the intensity of HIV-1BaL-Tomato, CD14-PE-Cy7, and DAPI fluorescence was calculated across a defined cell area. phagocytosis efficiency in THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. the uptake of conSgp140-conjugated 1 m, 0.2 m, or 40 nm fluorescent beads was analyzed by flow cytometry."}
