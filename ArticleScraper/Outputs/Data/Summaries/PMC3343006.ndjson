{"summary": "the coV virion consists of a helical nucleocapsid, made up of the CoV N protein and the genome, surrounded by a lipid envelope. the coV E protein is small (76\u2013108aa), is predicted to contain a single hydrophobic domain (HD) and is a minor component of the virion envelope. there is no direct evidence that CoV E acts as an ion channel during infection. addition of HMA to either MHV or HCoV 229E infected cells inhibits viral replication. mutations introduced into the HD of MHV E impair virus production suggesting that the putative ion channel activity may play a role during infection. the hairpin topology has been reported for MHV E and SARS-CoV E [15]\u2013[17]. these discrepancies suggest that CoV E may adopt more than one membrane topology. if this is the case, CoV E may perform distinct functions depending on how it is inserted into the membrane. this finding linked the efficient release of particles to the alteration of the host secretory pathway. we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis on the HD and identified a key residue required for disrupting the secretory pathway. we also addressed the role of topology in disrupting the secretory pathway. glycoproteins become resistant to digestion with endo H in the medial-Golgi. this assay monitors the rate at which a glycoprotein moves through the Golgi complex. a single polar uncharged residue within the HD of IBV E is required for disrupting protein trafficking. a single polar uncharged residue within the HD of IBV E (T16) is required for the disruption of the secretory pathway. a single polar uncharged residue within the HD of IBV E (T16) is required for the disruption of the secretory pathway. T16 does not tolerate Substitution of Conserved Amino Acids. mutations at position 16 in IBV E replaced threonine with serine, asparagine or glutamine. mutant proteins were transiently expressed along with VSV G to determine their effect on protein trafficking. IBV E protein with S, N or Q substituted for T16 does not induce Golgi complex disassembly. asterisk denotes a significant increase in Golgi disruption compared to the control by Student's t-test. data were normalized to the amount of M expressed in each sample. the amount of M released with IBV E was set to 1 for ease of comparison. asterisk denotes a significant decrease in VLP level compared to IBV E by Student's t-test (p4103) we found that the half-life of IBV E was longer (3.6 h) than that of MHV E (2 h), SARS-CoV E (2.1 h) or TGEV E (2.6 h) we could not compare the absolute expression level of each protein. therefore, it is possible that MHV E, SARS-CoV E and TGEV E do not accumulate to as high a level as IBV E in this expression system. as a control we co-expressed a luminal ER protein (CFP-KDEL) and a protein present on the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi complex (golgin160-Myc) as expected, the cytoplasmic epitope of golgin160-Myc was accessible after either Triton X-100 or digitonin permeabilization. the luminal epitope of CFP-KDEL was not accessible when cells were mutant IBV E proteins predominantly adopt either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology. this difference was not statistically significant, but we speculate there may be a small population of IBV E that is inserted as a membrane hairpin. the transmembrane topology of IBV E promotes disruption of the Golgi complex. the asterisk denotes a significant increase in Golgi disruption compared to the control by Student's t-test. the topology of IBV E-T16A was identical to IBV E. ssIBV E disrupted protein trafficking similar to IBV E. this could indicate the IBV E hairpin does have some effect on trafficking. ssFLAG-IBV E disrupted the Golgi complex, but to a lower degree than IBV E or ssIBV E. cells expressing ssIBV E produced less VLPs than wild-type IBV E. cells expressing ssIBV E produced almost no VLPs. ssIBV E or FLAG-IBV E produce normal levels of VLPs. data were normalized to the amount of M released with no E, IBV E, ssIBVE or FLAG-IBV E. trafficking of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) was measured using metabolic labeling in a pulse-chase assay coupled with endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion. a single polar uncharged residue within the HD of IBV E is required for disrupting protein trafficking. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on cells transiently expressing IBV E or the mutant proteins. cells were stained for IBV E and GM130, a marker of the Golgi complex. the asterisk denotes a significant increase in Golgi disruption compared to the control by Student's t-test (p5.4103). a multiple sequence alignment of several different coV E proteins showed that a polar uncharged residue is conserved at position 16 in IBV E. T16 to S, N, or Q does not induce Golgi complex disassembly. asterisk denotes a significant increase in Golgi disruption compared to control by Student's t-test. data were normalized to the amount of M released with no E, IBV E, T16A, T16S, T16Q or T16N. asterisk denotes a significant decrease in VLP level compared to IBV E by Student's t-test (p4103) we found that the half-life of IBV E was longer (3.6 h) than that of MHV E (2 h), SARS-CoV E (2.1 h) or TGEV E (2.6 h). however, we could not compare the absolute expression level of each protein. it is possible that MHV E, SARS-CoV E and TGEV E do not accumulate to as high a level as IBV E in this expression system. we transiently expressed IBV E, ssIBV E, and FLAG-IBV E in HeLa cells. as a control we co-expressed a luminal ER protein (CFP-KDEL) and a protein present on the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi complex (golgin160-Myc) as expected, the cytoplasmic epitope of golgin160-Myc was accessible after either Triton X-100 or mutant IBV E proteins predominantly adopt either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology. the NC ratio was lower for ssIBV E than for FLAG-IBV E. mutant IBV E proteins predominantly adopt either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology. asterisk denotes a significant decrease in NC between the Triton X-100 and digitonin signal by Student's t-test. transmembrane topology of IBV E promotes disruption of the Golgi complex. the transmembrane topology of IBV E promotes disruption of protein trafficking. ssIBV E disrupted protein trafficking similar to IBV E. this could indicate the IBV E hairpin does have some effect. ssFLAG-IBV E disrupted the Golgi complex, but to a lower degree than IBV E or ssIBV E. cells expressing ssIBV E produced less VLPs than wild-type IBV E. ssFLAG-IBV E also produced reduced levels of VLPs. cells expressing FLAG-IBV E produced almost no VLPs. this indicates that the membrane hairpin topology alone may not support the production of particles. this result is harder to interpret. mutants showed that a transmembrane topology was required for secretory pathway disruption. the residue equivalent to T16 in SARS-CoV E, N15, is predicted to lie in the pore region of a homo-pentamer. both are predicted to be important for the ion channel activity of the peptide. the best studied viroporin is influenza M2, which forms a tetrameric pH-activated proton channel. the M2 channel acidifies the interior of the virion during entry to aid in unpacking the genome. the secretory pathway raises the pH of the trans-Golgi to prevent premature activation of the fusion protein. a future goal will be to analyze recombinant viruses carrying mutations at T16 with quantitative trafficking assays. a future goal will be to analyze recombinant viruses carrying mutations at T16. a future goal will be to analyze recombinant viruses carrying mutations at T16. at least some function(s) of the E protein are conserved among CoVs. however, the requirement for its function(s) may vary significantly due to the compensatory action of other viral proteins or differences in cell and tissue types infected. IBV E is significantly larger and contains more polar residues in its HD than the other CoV E proteins. this could be addressed by determining how chimeric proteins affect the secretory pathway and virus replication. previous reports on CoV E protein topology have suggested that it may exist either as a transmembrane protein or as a membrane hairpin. a small amount of coV E in the membrane hairpin conformation could play a catalytic role during assembly. it is possible that a portion of the E protein adopts a membrane hairpin topology. this would explain why FLAG-IBV E could not support VLP production on its own. ssIBV E was amplified by RT-PCR of RNA from IBV infected cells. mutations of the HD of IBV E were introduced via Quikchange mutagenesis. the vector was digested with EcoRI and BglII. ssFLAG E was generated by ligating the same FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) into the ssIBV E construct after digestion with BglII. pCAGGS SARS E (Urbani) has been previously described. mouse anti-GM130 was from BD Biosciences, rabbit anti-GFP was from Molecular Probes, mouse anti-FLAG M2 was from Sigma and the monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. the Texas Red conjugated donkey anti-rat was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. cells were incubated in cysteine-methionine free DMEM for 15 min. labeled cells were labeled with 50 Ci of Expre35S35S [35S]-methionine-cysteine. samples were lysed in detergent solution with protease inhibitor cocktail. orescence microscopy cells plated on glass coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence 18\u201322 h after transfection. cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. cells were permeabilized in 0.5% TX-100 for 3 min and washed in PBS/Gly. the cells were transfected with CFP-KDEL (0.2 g) and golgin160-Myc (1 g) for control samples or with IBV E (0.5 g), pCAGGS-ssIBVE (1.5 g), pCAGGS-FLAG-IBV E (0.5 g), pCAGGS ssFLAG-IBV E (0.5 g), pCAGGS ssFLAG-IBV E (0.5 DNA stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 g/ml) DNA was stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 g/ml) samples were prepared 42\u201348 hours post transfection. the pellet containing the VLPs was resuspended in 1 glycoprotein denaturation buffer. the cells were scraped off the dish in 1 ml PBS and pelleted at 4000g for 2 min. both samples were digested with PNGase F. proteins HeLa cells were treated with 100 g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) diluted into culture media at 18 hours-post transfection. images were collected from each time point at the same exposure time. a sequence encoding an initiation codon and the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) with flanking BglII sites was ligated directly upstream of the start codon of IBV E to generate ssIBV E. pCAGGS SARS E (Urbani) has been previously described. rabbit anti-MHV E and rabbit anti-TGEV E used for immunofluorescence were kind gifts from Paul Masters. the rabbit anti-GM130 was from BD Biosciences, rabbit anti-GFP was from Molecular Probes, mouse anti-FLAG M2 was from Sigma. the monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. cells were transfected with pCAGGS VSV G (1 g) or a control plasmid (0.5 g pCAGGS IBV M) cells were labeled with 50 Ci of Expre35S35S [35S]-methionine-cysteine (Perkin Elmer) in cysteine-methionine free DMEM for 15 min. labeled proteins were visualized by using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimager (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad) cells plated on glass coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence 18\u201322 h after transfection. the percent disrupted was calculated by dividing the number of cells scored as disrupted by the total number of cells measured. cells were washed with a cold KHM (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 110 mM KOOCH3, 2 mM Mg(OOCH3)2) and kept on ice. the cells were moved to room temperature and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. antibodies were the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (11000), Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (11000), and Texas Red conjugated donkey anti-rat (1500).
