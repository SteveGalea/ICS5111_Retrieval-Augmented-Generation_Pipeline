{"summary": "hepatitis C is a disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a hepacivirus that infects approximately 3% of the world\u2019s population. the healthcare costs associated with HCV infection are estimated to be $6.5 billion in the united states alone. new viruses have been found in a wide range of mammalian hosts, including bats (Epstein et al. 2010; Quan et al. 2013); primates (Lauck et al. 2013; Sibley et al. 2014); rodents (Drexler et al. 2013; Kapoor, Simmonds, Scheel, et al. 2014); domesticated animals such as dogs (Kapoor et al. 2011; El genomes of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses are conserved and share many similarities. both genera are single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. genomes of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses tend to be around 10 kb in length. hepaciviruses and pegiviruses infect a wide range of mammals. hepaciviruses and pegiviruses infect a wide range of mammals. hepaciviruses are of significant interest for at least two reasons. meric mice have been used as small animal models of HCV infection. lack of functional or natural immune system limits use of hepaciviruses. recombination may explain origin of pegivirus-like ribosomal entry sites in rodent hepaciviruses. in this study, we perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses that draws together all currently available data. intriguingly, we find some evidence for interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses. hepacivirus and pegivirus alignments were 1,927 and 2,233 amino acids in length. this represents 64% and 74% of their total coding regions. ML phylogenies were estimated using RAxML (Stamatakis 2006) a single representative was randomly chosen from each defined lineage in the ML phylogenies of hepaciviruses (lineages A\u2013J in fig. 2) and pegiviruses (lineages K\u2013Q in fig. 3. for the hepaciviruses, these were sequences U94695, KC796075, KC796087, KC410872, KC796088, KF234499, and U22303. letters indicate the different Pegivirus lines discussed in the main text. phylogeny of the Pegiviruses was assessed using a bootstrap approach (100 replicates) Tip and branch labels are colored by host species type. multiple phylogenies were estimated from genomic regions either side of the putative recombination breakpoints. for each potential recombinant lineage, we estimated a ML phylogenetic tree from the proposed recombinant region within the genome-wide multiple alignment. potential recombinant lineages will change their position in the phylogeny if recombination has taken place. one representative genome from each genotype of HCV and HPgV was selected for inclusion in the data set. Biological information obtained for each sequence included accession number, host species, isolate name, and country of collection. alignments were generated for hepacivirus and pegivirus complete coding sequences. multiple alignments of partial NS3 and NS5B proteins contain substantially less phylogenetic information but include a wider range of taxa. a single representative was randomly chosen from each defined lineage in ML phylogenies of hepaciviruses. giviruses were sequences U45476, KC796090, JQ434007, KC411806, KC796077, KC411777, KC815312, KC551802, AF179612, and KP265943. Statistical support for phylogenetic nodes was assessed using a bootstrap approach (100 replicates) sequences that met these conditions underwent additional investigation using the RDP4 program (Martin et al. 2015), which implements multiple methods of recombination detection including GENECOV (Padidam et al. 1999), 3SEQ (Boni et al. 2007), Chimaera (Posada and Crandall 2001), and MaxChi (Maynard-Smith 1992). equids and bovids share a similar ecological relationship with humans through domestication that may play a role in cross-species transmission. a computer program (available on GitHub with basic documentation at https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline) was used to identify parallel amino acid changes, that is, those present in all viruses descended from the ancestral branches defined above. phylogeny of genome-wide hepacivirus alignment (fig. 2) shows two distinct monophyletic clades. only viruses from bats and rodents are found in both upper and lower clades. taxa within most lineages are genetically relatively similar. some differences between the genome-wide and subgenomic phylogenies may be due to random error or long-branch attraction. but the well supported rearrangements seen in the partial NS5B tree suggest that detailed analysis of potential recombination in the hepaciviruses is warranted. lineage M contains viruses from africa and Asian bats of various species. lineage O contains sequences of GB virus A from south american primates. lineage P represents equine pegivirus species from Europe and North America. lineage Q contains rodent and bat virus viruses sampled in africa and north and south America. hepaciviruses exhibit fewer topological changes among the different phylogenies. many of the non-HPgV s were sampled in africa. only the equine pegiviruses were isolated in Europe. the proposed recombinants identified by RECCO were subsequently analyzed in detail using the methods implemented in RDP (table 1). each putative recombinant event had an associated binomial P value 0.00001, representing the probability that, in the specified region, the recombinant is more closely related to the minor parent than the major parent by chance alone (the minor parent is the apparent contributor of smaller recombinant fragment) estimated 5\u2032 breakpoints positions are 1,000\u20131,500 nt downstream of those detected with RECCO. recombinant fragments most likely lie between 5\u2032 boundary and middle of NS5B. recombinant fragments most likely lie between 5\u2032 boundary and middle of NS5B. the putative recombinant region of KC551802 is closely related to lineage J. this observation could result from random error or long-branch attraction rather than recombination. for KC796077 and KC796090, the topology of trees estimated for the two genome regions are substantially different. disproportionate number of parallel mutations found in hepaciviruses. hepacivirus NS3 and NS5B regions exhibit high density of parallel mutations. hepacivirus NS3 and NS5B regions exhibit high density of parallel mutations. hepaciviruses identified one parallel amino acid mutation shared by three branches basal to human/primate viruses. one mutation shared by three branches basal to human/primate viruses (lineages B, F, and H; position 4923 in hepacivirus reference genome H77; fig. 1). phylogeny of genome-wide hepacivirus alignment shows two distinct monophyletic clades (upper and lower; defined by the most basal well-supported split) only viruses from bats and rodents are found in both the upper and lower clades. lineage J represents the recently discovered hepacivirus lineage in cattle. hepacivirus lineage (J) is an outgroup of the lower clade. the lowest bootstrap scores are observed for lineages E and I. the topology of the upper clade is maintained. equine and canine hepaciviruses lineages are isolated from hosts from the same continent, except for lineages E, I, and J. lines E and I contain diverse viruses found in African, European, and North American rodents. lineage J contains viruses isolated in African and European cattle. lineage n contains sequences of GB virus A from south american primates. genome-wide pegivirus phylogeny shows that HPgV is a well-supported sister group of the african simian pegiviruses (lineages K and L; fig. 3). lines M and N are also closely related. most lineages are separated by long internal branches. non-HPgV s were sampled in africa and only the equine pegiviruses were isolated in Europe. recombination analysis of that genus was not pursued. significant results were obtained for the representatives of three hepacivirus lineages. RDP results from the Hepacivirus Lineage Representatives Recombinant Lineage Sequence Binomial P Value Bootstrap Support (%) Major Parent Lineage Minor Parent Lineage Positive in Programs Recombinant Positions (H77 Reference) the recombinant fragments most likely lie between the 5\u2032 boundary and the middle of NS5B. the hypothesized major parent lineages for each putative recombinant are consistent with the hepacivirus phylogeny estimated from the genome-wide alignment. trees were estimated from the putative recombinant fragment (bottom row) and from remainder of the genome (top row) using ML. tree topology was fixed for all sequences except the putative recombinant sequence in question. tree topology was fixed for all sequences except the sequence in question. the hepacivirus NS3 and NS5B regions exhibit a high density of parallel mutations (15 and 13, respectively). the hepacivirus NS3 and NS5B regions also exhibit a high density of parallel mutations (15 and 13, respectively). parallel mutations are of particular interest if they occur on genetically distinct lines that infect related hosts. these are less likely to arise by chance and may represent viral adaptations to specific types of hosts. hepaciviruses identified one mutation along that was parallel along three branches basal to human/primate viruses. bats have been suggested to be a reservoir of both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses due to their basal position in phylogenetic trees and the paraphyletic grouping of bat pegiviruses. the currently known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses from bats are unlikely to represent the virus populations directly responsible for zoonotic transmission. pegiviruses in commensal rat species represent a population with considerable direct and indirect interactions with humans. there could be intermediate hosts between humans and horses, as the branches separating HCV and equine hepaciviruses are not short. only further sampling will be able to resolve this. many new hepaciviruses and pegiviruses have been discovered in recent years. there is a huge diversity of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses yet to be discovered. only 22 species of bat have had hepaciviruses or pegiviruses isolated from them. a high level of undersampling is by no means unique to these two genera. it has been estimated that within just nine viral families there is likely to be a vast diversity of viral species yet to be discovered in mammals. if new viruses are found that fall basal to the currently known hepaciviruses, then we would expect that the original criteria for defining these two sister genera may be questioned. hepacivirus NS3-4A protease can cleave human antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) equine hepacivirus NS3-4A protease is capable of cleaving human mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) it remains unclear whether either equine hepacivirus or HCV proteases can cleave human MAVS. previous studies have analyzed the phylogenetic history of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses using partial NS3 and NS5B gene sequences. these genes are highly conserved due to their importance in viral replication, making them easier and quicker to identify in new host species using PCR. the number of sequences for these regions is correspondingly greater than for whole genomes. the sites exhibiting parallel evolution identified here will provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of species-specific replication and the evolution of host\u2013virus interactions. further investigation in future research will shed light on the mechanisms of cross-species transmission."}
