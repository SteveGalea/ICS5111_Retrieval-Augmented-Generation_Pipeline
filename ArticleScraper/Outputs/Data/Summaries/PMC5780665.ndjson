{"summary": "the world was fortunate not to have experienced another devastating influenza epidemic, because the fatality rate of the new virus strain was similar to seasonal influenza virus. there remains an inevitability of a new influenza pandemic, which could be highly infectious and deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic. methods Surveillance site Wuxi is a prefecturelevel city of Jiangsu province. it has seven districts and two countylevel cities (Jiangyin and Yixing) routinely collected data included respiratory illness with fever and classified pneumonia. the total number of patient visits ranged from 11 000 to 14 000/week. the total number of patient visits ranged from 11 000 to 14 000/week. adjusted average weekly proportion of ILI (P\u2019) and standard deviation (Sp\u2019) were calculated with those data in the state of statistical control. the threshold was defined as P\u2019 + 2Sp. the proportion of patient visits for ILI was calculated as the number of patients with ILI divided by the total number of patients. the system was built with special attention to lower respiratory illness, especially pneumonia caused by unknown reagent like SARS. the chisquare test was used to check the normality of the data. both a control chart method 5, 6, 7 and a moving average regression method 8, 9 were applied to produce the threshold value. alarms of potential epidemics were raised when the input surveillance data of 2009 surpassed the threshold. influenza epidemic spread widely during September to December in the general population. 132 confirmed cases in September, 89 cases in October, 146 cases in November, and 113 cases in December. last identified patient was reported on February 12, 2010. the 2003 SARS outbreak provided an opportunity to learn about outbreaks and prevention measures. in 2009, significantly higher RIWF counts and total visiting patients were observed compared with those observed in 2007 and 2008. the proportion of RIWF to total patient visits (1176%) was significantly higher than that in the previous 2 years. control chart method was used to determine an influenza threshold by week. alarms of aberrant higher proportions of illness appeared in week 18, week 20 to week 29, week 31 to week 41, week 45 to week 47 and week 49. the ILI counts were higher than mean + 16 SD in week 34 to week 37, week 39, and week 45 to week 47. the aberration points were consistent with the reported date of the first local case, the outbreak in schools, and the peak in the general population. the proportion of ILI appeared 4 weeks earlier before the first imported case of influenza A (H1N1) and started to decline after week 28. the proportion of ILI peaked in the general population at week 39 (474%), when the schools also experienced a peak of illness. the proportion of RIWF began to increase in week 32, around the time of the first imported influenza A (H1N1) case. the trend of UP surveillance data was similar to the trend of ILI data (2, 3). the threshold was calibrated as the average weekly proportion of ILI + 2Sp (32%) weekly ILI% is calculated as the weekly counts of ILI to total patient visits. occurrence of each important epidemic event is marked by a vertical line. weekly counts of ILI to total patient visits marked by vertical line. Ip, the first imported influenza A (H1N1) case; Lc, the first local influenza A (H1N1) case; Sc, the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in school; Pk, the epidemic peak of influenza A (H1N1) in general population. the population at risk could be another reason for not being able to detect outbreaks because the sentinel UP data provide additional information to detect influenza epidemic. the increased proportion of ILI and RIWF observed after week 29 was more likely due to the high incidence of H1N1 influenza in general population. the control chart method and the Serfling method are time series approaches. the serfling method optimizes the threshold calibration by excluding unexpected data that are beyond the controlled scope. the control chart method detected all four remarkable signals. the control chart method had better sensitivity and timeliness. the second alarm was 1 week after the peak in the general population. the second alarm was 1 week after the peak in the general population. the principle is to improve performance of surveillance systems and allow timely precautionary measures to be implemented in vulnerable populations. the study was supported by the National Megaproject of Science Research Project (2009ZX1004904), Jiangsu Provincial Project of Health Research (H200956), and Jiangsu Provincial Project of Preventive Medicine Research (Y201026) infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1998; 19:194\u2013214.
