{"summary": "twenty-one resolutions adopted in the 16 assemblies between 1948 and 2013 targeted one or more of these eight NZDs, representing 4% of the total resolutions on infectious diseases passed to date. however, three major NZDs remain outside this recent resolution: anthrax, brucellosis, and bovine TB. endemic countries are still lacking despite being prioritised by the WHA as early as the 1950s. global advocacy for control of the NZDs as a whole would benefit from one health approach as is promoted for the NTDs under WHA66.12. rapid response to recent zoonoses outbreaks demonstrates how the mobilisation of considerable political and financial support is possible on a regional\u2014if not global scale. the linkages between poverty and the Millennium Development Goals are clearly acknowledged in the literature. the WHO has identified a subgroup of eight endemic or \u201cneglected zoonotic diseases\u201d (NZDs) the endemic zoonoses may truly be cast as \u201cneglected\u201d in terms of political profile and relative funding. resolutions from all 66 WHA meetings held between 1948 and 2013 were examined to determine those that include a specific focus on the eight major NZDs. resolutions relevant to NZDs were selected from the annual lists of resolutions [14]\u2013[17]. Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) 1950 WHA3.28 Expert Committee on Zoonoses (1950), WHA5.60 (1952), WHA66.12 (2013) Described as \u201cone of the most dreaded diseases\u201d in first decade of existence of WHO. no subsequent mention since 1958. WHA66.12 Encompasses 17 WHO-listed NTDs including 5 NZDs. the three bacterial NZDs (anthrax, BTB, and brucellosis) Zoonoses 1969 WHA22.35 WHA31.48 (1978) anthrax was one of five diseases dealt with in detail at the inaugural meeting in 1950 of the expert committee on zoonoses. the disease is addressed by the recent Resolution WHA55.16 (2002), which concerns bioterrorism. an expert group on brucellosis was convened at the inaugural WHA in 1948. it requested that the WHO Director-General designate regional centres for control of the disease. there have been no further brucellosis-specific WHA resolutions, and the disease is not included in WHA66.12. despite the fact that HAT comprises two distinct diseases (chronic Gambian and acute Rhodesian sleeping sickness) that demand different control approaches, they are not distinguished in the currently adopted resolutions nor within any TDR directive. the passing of WHA60.13 in 2007 was an important step in advocacy for this disease. no subsequent resolutions specifically addressed rabies until WHA66.12 included this disease within the group of 17 targeted NTDs. resolution follows the London Declaration on NTDs in 2012 [26] and is a landmark for advocacy for the NTDs and NZDs. anthrax and brucellosis are listed as \u201ctool-deficient\u201d diseases for which better control methods need to be developed. this report acknowledged their importance, flagging veterinary public health as one of five public-health strategies for the prevention and control of NTDs. a series of high-profile meetings for advocacy for NZDs has been promoted by a series of high-profile meetings for advocacy since 2005. the inaugural NZD advocacy meeting, entitled The Control of Neglected Zoonoses: a route to poverty Alleviation, focused on reasons why the poor suffer disproportionately from NZDs. the meeting focused on reasons why the poor suffer disproportionately from NZDs. in 2011, a high-level technical meeting was convened by WHO/FAO/OIE. the HLTM highlighted rabies as a priority, indicating that advocacy for NZDs is steadily improving. there is a perception that the NTDs and NZDs have been historically \u201cneglected\u201d by decision makers. three neglected zoonotic diseases were omitted from Resolution WHA66.12. they include anthrax, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis. the resolution raises awareness of the potential for integrated control and surveillance systems. chinococcus, human africa trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis are included in the list of NTDs identified by Resolution WHA66.12. however, anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, and brucellosis are still lacking the high-level advocacy required to mobilize political support for their control in endemic countries. brucellosis, hydatidosis, and bovine tuberculosis were highlighted in the early years. a joint FAO/WHO meeting in 1967 highlighted more than 150 zoonoses. 21 resolutions targeted one or more of the eight NZDs. the disease was deemed a significant risk to public health and trade. there has been no specific mention of anthrax as a zoonotic disease at the WHA. the disease is addressed by the recent Resolution WHA55.16 (2002). the disease is not included in a resolution in 2013 under WHA66.12. the disease had been highlighted in the WHO's \"Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases 2008\u20132015\" as a \u201ctool-ready\u201d disease. leishmaniasis was not specifically addressed at the WHA until 2007, despite the 1950 Expert Committee listing this as one of the diseases that required further study. the passing of WHA60.13 in 2007 was an important step in advocacy for this disease. countries where it is a public-health problem have been urged to strengthen efforts for control and strengthen existing epidemiological data. resolutions previously targeted specific NTDs separately, but sufficient momentum can now be built towards control and eradication of these diseases as a group. the cluster of bacterial NZDs that present a significant burden to rural populations in endemic countries are not included in Resolution WHA66.12. veterinary public health is one of five public-health strategies for the prevention and control of NTDs. a four-year commitment to address neglected tropical diseases in africa in January 2012 firmly recognises the importance of NTDs. the subsequent WHO Roadmap for NTDs acknowledges that control of NZDs is cost-effective. the meeting focused on reasons why the poor suffer disproportionately from NZDs. the benefits of joint human-animal health systems was considered key for successful NZD control. a third international NZD meeting focused on community-based approaches for NZD control. interaction between stakeholders encouraged by the Tripartite and collaboration in control efforts may pave the way for zoonotic diseases to move higher up the agenda of disease control and international health. there are a number of reasons for such neglect, partly driven by the fact that their burden is often solely found in developing countries. unless a problem can be quantified, it is difficult to argue for funding and attention by policy makers. the passing of resolution WHA66.12 in may 2013 is seen as a significant step in the right direction towards increased advocacy for the neglected tropical diseases. the resolution raises awareness of the potential for integrated control and surveillance systems that tackle a number of coendemic diseases simultaneously under a One Health approach. neglected tropical diseases have historically been \u201cforgotten\u201d in terms of funding and collective action for control. the passing of the recent World Health Assembly Resolution WHA66.12 is a key step in the advocacy process for the neglected tropical diseases. anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, and brucellosis are still lacking the high-level advocacy required to mobilize political support for their control in endemic countries. key papers in the field Hotez PJ, Molyneux DH, Fenwick A, Kumaresan J, Sachs SE, and others."}
