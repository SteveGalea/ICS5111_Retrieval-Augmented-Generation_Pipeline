{"summary": "influenza epidemics and unpredictable yet potentially severe pandemics are the consequence of the continuing variation of these viruses. the virus is related to the antigenic instability of the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) currently available drugs for prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections are the M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) adenovirus fusion inhibitors have been described as potent inhibitors of adenovirus binding to sialic acids (22). a compound for use in an alternative strategy, enzymatic removal of the sialic acid moieties from the host cell receptors, is currently being explored in the form of Fludase (4). the acidic pH inside the endosome triggers an extensive and irreversible rearrangement of the HA protein to adopt its fusogenic conformation. zin was shown to cause NP aggregation, thereby preventing nuclear import of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) alternative approaches focus on inhibition of cellular proteins involved in influenza virus entry, such as PI3K/Akt signaling factors (13) or protein kinase C (PKC) (45). the study reported here is the first to elaborate on the anti-influenza virus potential of glycopeptide derivatives. we focused on a compound designated SA-19, which contains an aglycoristocetin moiety coupled to a phenylbenzyl-substituted cyclobutenedione. a different glycopeptide compound with anti-HCV activity was shown to inhibit a postentry event. the human influenza virus strains A/PR/8/34 (A/H1N1) and B/HK/5/72 were obtained from ATCC. the strains A/X-31 (A/H3N2) and B/HK/7/87 (A/H3N2) were a gift from J.

RESULTS Activity of glycopeptide derivatives against human influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses. the basic anti-influenza virus activity was evaluated in a CPE reduction assay with two virus strains, i.e., A/HK/7/87 (A/H3N2) and B/HK/5/72. aglycoristocetin and aglycoteicoplanin contain similar central heptapeptide cores. aglycoristocetin lacks the chloro substituents on the tyrosine of the E unit. aglycoristocetin lacks the chloro substituents on the C and E rings present in aglycoteicoplanin. antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50, defined as the compound concentration producing 50% inhibition of virus replication. d Cytotoxicity was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC); the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50; estimated by the MTS cell viability assay); or the concentration causing 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50; determined by cell counting). demic A/H1N1 virus (strain A/Virginia/ATCC3/2009) has two (V27T and S31N) amantadine resistance mutations in the M2 protein. SA-19 was equally effective against wild-type A/X-31 virus and an HA-D1122N A/X-31 mutant. 2 0.10 0.55 0.03 10 2 0.12 0.06 A/X-31 (HA2-D112N)d 0.41 1.1 16 25 0.056 0.082 A/HK/2/68 1.5 0.5 1.9 0.5 10 0 10 1 1.2 0.6 5.9 2.8 A/Victoria/3/75 0.86 0.28 0.88 0.26 8.3 1.4 8.3 2.0 0.20 0.20 0.20 A/HK/7/87 0.36 0.15 0.58 0.06 8.2 1.1 the strong activity of SA-19 was confirmed in virus yield experiments. the EC99 values were 0.55 0.03 M for SA-19, 0.12 0.06 M for oseltamivir, and 10 2 M for ribavirin. FITC-labeled maackia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra-I lectin showed that all cell lines expressed both types of receptors. the expression level of the receptor type was 3-fold lower in QT6 cells, 2-fold lower in Vero cells, and 2-fold higher in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. the antiviral compounds were added at times in a range from 30 min to 8 h p.i. at 10 h p.i., vRNA copies were quantified by RT-PCR. MDCK cells were infected with a/X-31 influenza virus at an MOI of 0.0004 PFU per cell. compounds were added at 30 min, 0 h, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, or 8 h p.i. at 10 h p.i., the cells were subjected to RNA extraction for subsequent vRNA analysis by real-time RT-PCR. lysates were treated with trypsin to cleave HA0, washed, and incubated for 15 min. pH was lowered to 5.0 and cells were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. aglycovancomycin analogue was antivirally inactive in the CPE assay. aglycoristocetin is 11-fold less active than SA-19. aglycoristocetin is 11-fold less active than the aglycovancomycin analogue. HA-expressing HeLa cells were preincubated with compound. then briefly exposed to pH 5 to trigger refolding of HA. no inhibition was seen with SA-19, whether added during the preincubation stage or the acid pulse and/or syncytium formation phase. three clones (designated 15-cl1, -cl2 and -cl3) were randomly selected for antiviral testing. their antiviral EC50s for SA-19, amantadine, and oseltamivir (Table 3) were similar to the values obtained for the A/Ned/378/05 starting virus (Table 2). the control virus that underwent passage in the absence of compound contained no mutations in HA. the control virus that underwent passage in the absence of compound contained no mutations in HA. 0 7-cl2 NA, none; HA, R1561G; G1891R 0.29 0.06 105 24 >100 >100 12 2 7-cl3 NA, none; HA, R1561G; G1891R 0.42 0.06 198 98 >100 >100 11 0 Control (no compound) 15-cl1 HA, M2, NA: none 0.25 0.10 11 8 0.21 0.05 0.10 9.1 0.5 15-cl2 vRNPs released from the endosomes efficiently entered the nucleus within 1 h p.i. at 1 h p.i., virus was localized by confocal microscopy. in the absence of compounds, the vRNPs released from the endosomes efficiently entered the nucleus within 1 h p.i. the inactive aglycovancomycin analogue, SA-26, and underivatized ristocetin (panels F1 and F2) did not inhibit the nuclear entry of the vRNP. with SA-48, the aglycoteicoplanin analogue of SA-19, a complete inhibition was observed, but only at cytotoxic concentrations. MDCK cells were infected with a/X-31 influenza virus (at 4 PFU per cell) in the presence of 10 M SA-19. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained. influenza virus was detected with anti-NP antibody. infected cells, staining for EEA1 and LBPA unchanged by SA-19 or 4c. neither of the two compounds exerts an aspecific effect on the formation of early and late endosomes. transfection was kept as small as possible (32). Upon confocal microscopy, the green color representing GFP-coupled Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 or YFP-coupled LAMP-1 showed a punctate pattern, indicating that the bulk of the expressed proteins was indeed associated with endosomal vesicles. SA-19 inhibits nuclear entry by causing the formation of intracellular aggregates. acridine orange is an acidotropic dye. it is protonated and sequestered and fluoresces red. the dye has no effect on the endosomal pH. a general antiviral effect of SA-19 on diverse viruses can be excluded. we examined whether SA-19 inhibits the entry of retroviral particles carrying the influenza virus HA and NA (to allow release of the particles from the producer cells) both compounds produced a marked and dose-dependent inhibition of the transduction by HA-containing pseudoparticles. both compounds also inhibited the transduction of VSV-G-carrying particles. the effect appears to be directed toward the influenza virus spike protein (HA or NA) or the virus envelope. analysis of antiviral EC50 data enabled us to further define the structure-activity relationship. the most potent compound, SA-19, showed an average EC50 of 0.39 M. it consists of aglycoristocetin coupled to a cyclobutenedione and substituted with a phenylbenzyl group. aglycoristocetin lacks chloro substituents on the C and E rings present in aglycoteicoplanin. the 4-methyl substituent is missing in aglycoteicoplanin. the chloro substituents appear to have the highest negative impact on anti-influenza virus activity. antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50, defined as the compound concentration producing 50% inhibition of virus replication. d Cytotoxicity was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC); the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50; estimated by the MTS cell viability assay); or the concentration causing 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50; determined by cell counting). antiviral activity in influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus-infected MDCK cellsa Strain CPE reduction assay. results in increased pH of HA-mediated fusion and renders virus resistant to the fusion inhibitor 4c (59) 88 0.26 8.3 1.4 8.3 2.0 0.20 0.20 A/HK/7/87 0.36 0.15 0.58 0.06 8.2 1.1 6.4 0.9 1.4 0.8 2.7 1.5 A/Ishikawa/7/82 0.77 0.22 0.73 0.08 9.6 0.6 9.5 0.9 2.6 1.4 1.1 0.4 B B/Lee/40 1.4 0.8 0.91 0.49 14 7 16 4 1.3 1.4 0.9 B/HK/5/72 0.30 0.10 0. natant of a/X-31-infected MDCK cells at 72 h p.i. were 0.55 0.03 M for SA-19, 0.12 0.06 M for oseltamivir, and 10 2 M for ribavirin. the EC99 values were very similar to the antiviral EC50s for the A/X-31 virus strain determined by the CPE reduction assay. expression level of the (2, 6) receptor type was 3-fold lower in QT6 cells, 2-fold lower in Vero cells, and 2-fold higher in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. the virus was able to replicate in all cell lines used, since the increase in vRNA copies between 0 and 8 h p.i. was at least 50-fold in all cases. rimantadine (an M2 ion channel blocker); chloroquine (a weak base that increases the endosomal pH); bisindolylmaleimide I (a protein kinase C inhibitor that prevents nuclear entry of the vRNPs) at 10 h p.i., vRNA copies in the cells were quantified by RT-PCR. the cells were subjected to RNA extraction for subsequent vRNA analysis by real-time RT-PCR. the vRNA synthesis is presented as the fold increase in the number of vRNA copies at 10 h p.i. relative to the amount of virus particles added at time zero. HA-transfected cells were treated with trypsin to cleave HA0. pH was lowered to 5.0 and cells were incubated for 15 min. cells were fixed, stained with Giemsa, and examined by microscopy. inhibition of virus binding does not account for the potent antiviral effect of SA-19. it is likely related to the tendency of these lipophilic glycopeptides to exhibit aspecific protein binding. fusion inhibitor 4c binds to prefusion HA and prevents its conformational change. sensitivity to SA-19 remains unchanged after repeated virus passages. amantadine and oseltamivir were used as reference compounds. sensitivity to SA-19 remains unchanged after repeated virus passages. virus breakthrough was observed after only 5 passages. two amantadine-resistant virus clones were isolated. neither of the clones showed cross-resistance among the three test compounds. cloneb Mutation(s)c Antiviral EC50d (M) of: SA-19 Amantadine Oseltamivir carboxylate Zanamivir Ribavirin SA-19 (10 M) 15-cl1 HA: E692G 0.29 0.11 11 8 0.16 0.10 0.16 7.1 3.0 15-cl2 HA: E692G 0.36 0.02 6.5 3.7 0.58 0.39 0.40 9.2 0.3 15 the highest compound concentration used during the selection procedure is shown in parentheses. influenza virus isolate A/Ned/378/05 (A/H1N1) was subjected to serial passage in MDCK cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of SA-19, amantadine, or oseltamivir carboxylate. SA-19-treated cells contained large aggregates which showed an intense NP fluorescence staining. this indicates that the intracellular uptake of influenza virus was not reduced by SA-19. the pattern of NP staining in the presence of SA-19 was different from that obtained with reference compounds. MDCK cells were infected with a/X-31 influenza virus (MOI: 4 PFU per cell) in the presence of compound and incubated for 1 h at 35\u00b0C. after fixation and permeabilization, the cells were stained with anti-NP antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (green) influenza virus was detected with anti-NP antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (green) the nuclei were visualized with DAPI (blue) bar, 25 m. Colocalization studies with markers of early and late endosomes. influenza virus was visualized with anti-NP antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (green) analysis was performed with anti-EEA1 and LBPA primary antibodies as early and late endosome markers and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled secondary antibodies (red) NP staining at 1 h p.i. showed that SA-19 inhibits nuclear entry of the virus by causing the formation of intracellular aggregates. none of the endosomal or lysosomal markers appeared to colocalize with the virus trapped by SA-19. acridine orange is an acidotropic dye. its fluorescence is green at low concentrations, which changes to orange-red at high concentrations. lysosomal acidification is completely inhibited, resulting in yellow fluorescence. a general antiviral effect of SA-19 on diverse viruses can be excluded. we examined whether SA-19 inhibits the entry of GFP-expressing retroviral particles carrying the influenza virus HA and NA (to allow release of the particles from the producer cells) influenza viruses remain the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, posing a serious health threat during seasonal outbreaks as well as periodic pandemics. the only influenza virus entry inhibitors that are currently available, i.e., the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, have a low barrier for resistance selection. central aglycoristocetin moiety is coupled to a phenylbenzyl-substituted cyclobutenedione. the activity is confined to aglycoristocetin compounds. the lack of anti-influenza virus activity is clearly related to the two chloro functions in the heptapeptide core (ERJ-147), in which both chlorine atoms are absent. aglycoristocetin is well known for its property of causing thrombocyte aggregation. the rhamnose substituent is considered to play an essential role in the interaction of ristocetin with vWF. removal of this rhamnose was found to eliminate the thrombocyte-aggregating activity (3, 55) virus mutants with marked resistance to amantadine or oseltamivir appeared after only five or seven passages with amantadine or oseltamivir. the high resistance barrier for SA-19 may be considered an advantage in terms of its potential clinical application. the amantadine-resistant mutants that we selected contained mutations in HA. in time-of-addition experiments, the influenza virus entered the nucleus of MDCK cells within 1 h p.i. the consecutive stages in influenza virus entry consist of (i) HA-mediated binding to sialylated glycan receptors; (ii) endocytosis of the virus particle, presumably by the clathrin-mediated pathway. HA-mediated membrane fusion requires a low-pH-induced and extensive rearrangement of the coiled regions in the HA stem structure and extrusion of the conserved hydrophobic fusion peptide (6). removal of the acylation sites has been shown to impair HA-mediated syncytium formation in some studies. the NP staining pattern in SA-19-treated cells was clearly distinct from that seen with unrelated virus entry inhibitors. the ea1 early endosome marker is specifically associated with the cytoplasmic face of the early endosome membrane (63), while the LBPA late endosome marker is present in the complex system of internal membranes within the lumen of the late endosomes (27). Rab5 and Rab7 have been implicated in influenza virus endocytic trafficking. a disturbance effect of SA-19 during early endocytic trafficking seems contradicted by our observation that the arrest does not occur in Rab5- or EEA1-positive vesicles. aglycovancomycin analogue carrying the same lipophilic phenylbenzyl substituent (SA-26) was shown to be antivirally inactive. aglycovancomycin analogue carrying the same lipophilic phenylbenzyl substituent (SA-26) was shown to be antivirally inactive, while unsubstituted aglycoristocet was shown to be antivirally inactive. lipophilic substituent, did show anti-influenza virus activity. the finding that SA-19 was devoid of any inhibitory effect in the polykaryon assay contradicts the notion that SA-19 could act as a membrane fluidity modulator at the level of the plasma membrane. we hypothesize that the intracellular trapping of influenza virus by SA-19 may be related to a hydrophobic interaction between SA-19 and one or more cell membrane lipids. exposure was extended to 24 h, extensive accumulation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) was seen, independent of whether the cells were virus infected or not. several pharmacological agents are known to induce accumulation of MVBs, which, in the case of oritavancin, appears to be related to a lipid storage disorder (58). Whether SA-19 has similar effects on lipid storage is presently unknown. SA-19 appears to reversibly disturb the endocytic uptake of the virus by the host cell, causing virus trapping in a distinct vesicular compartment. further exploration of SA-19 or related analogues for potential use in influenza virus therapy is warranted."}
