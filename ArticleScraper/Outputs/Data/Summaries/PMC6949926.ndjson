{"summary": "TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen. one-third of the world\u2019s population is infected with TB. nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis. study was conducted at a regional hospital in Vhembe district, Limpopo province, south africa between 2014 and 2015. it used a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive design to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at regional hospital. the study was conducted at a regional hospital in Vhembe district in Limpopo province, south Africa. the total population of nurses working in the TB ward was 22 nurses. inclusion criteria were all nurses with five years\u2019 experience caring for TB patients since it was believed that they would provide information-rich data. data was collected by means of audio-recordings, field notes, and interviews. data was stored in a password-protected computer. access to the database was restricted to the researcher and supervisors only. participants were informed of their right to refuse to participate, or to withdraw from participating if they felt that they could not continue. participants were assured that the information they provided would not be used against them or shared with other people but would be reported as findings of the study. the participants were not victimized for refusing to participate in the study. the total population of nurses working in the TB ward was 22 nurses. 2.4. Sampling Procedure The study used a non-probability purposive sampling method. it involves selection of individuals for participation based on their knowledge of a phenomenon that is being studied. data was collected by means of audio-recordings, field notes, and in-depth interviews. data was stored in a password-protected computer. access to the database was restricted to the researcher and supervisors only. participants were informed of their right to refuse to participate, or to withdraw from participating if they felt that they could not continue. participants were assured that the information they provided would not be used against them or shared with other people but would be reported as findings of the study. participants were not victimized for refusing to participate. a discussion of findings follows the presentation of each theme. participants articulated that the hospital has a poor, aging infrastructure. TB wards were not structured to the standard that is suitable for TB wards. a study that was done by Kieft et al. [13] indicated that improved hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue and increase effectiveness in delivering care. findings of this study concur with the study that was done by Brophy [14], which indicated that the nurses were concerned with their occupational environment. findings of this study show there was a poor practice environment in the TB wards. there was also an inadequate supply of personal protective materials. this leads to negative practice by the nurses, since they are afraid to contract diseases. patients continued to default treatment for different reasons, such as side effects, alcohol abuse, cultural and religious beliefs. some default because they wanted to continue receiving the TB grant. findings of this study concur with those of a study done by Herrero et al. delays in TB diagnosis common in many regions worldwide. lack of equipment and working resources important in healthcare setting. lack of equipment and working resources impact quality of health in TB wards. a study by ten Hoeve et al. [21] found that there was a lack of skills and in-service training in the wards. a lack of skills and in-service training hindered the provision of quality healthcare, proper conduct of tests, therapies, investigations, and surgery. transmission generally occurs indoors, in dark and poorly ventilated spaces. the following sub-themes will be discussed under fear, anxiety, stress, and risk of contracting infection. TB patients are likely to transmit the disease to the healthcare workers since TB is an airborne disease. the transmission risk to HCWs is highest when patients have unrecognized TB or are receiving inappropriate treatment. many factors influence the risk of transmission and progression to active disease, including healthcare setting, occupational category, individual susceptibility/immune status. air droplet nuclei can remain airborne in room air for many hours. there must be a person with TB disease who produces the TB bacilli. anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected. despite TB being a curable disease, in almost all new cases, professionals have indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population. despite TB being a curable disease, in almost all new cases, professionals have indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population. nurses experience stress, frustration, and pain due to the conditions of TB patients. they always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives. when a patient dies, nurses feel sad and hurt. nursing managers are the vital link between hospital senior executives and direct care nurses. lack of support from the management confuses the nursing staff and causes staff to lose interest in their job. nurses do not receive personal psychological support when they need it. nurses are on the front line of fighting diseases in the world. they risk their lives to provide quality healthcare services in the hospital. TB nurses feel unappreciated for what they are doing. TB nurses are on the frontline of the fight against highly infectious diseases. they do not receive a danger allowance and the hospital does not celebrate TB day. poorly designed or overcrowded healthcare facilities play an important role in TB transmission and also increases the chances of cross-infection between patients and healthcare workers. a good ventilated working environment should have natural, mechanical, and negative pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of spreading TB infection. healthcare facilities should design policies and procedures for TB control. it should be reviewed periodically and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB. nurses have various unmet needs when they are doing their job. participants expressed the need for special support from the management. poor working conditions, lack of resources, special managerial support from the hospitals in south africa were the reasons why nurses left south africa to work abroad. the wards\u2019 layout is not conducive for TB wards, it has small windows that fuel bacterial concentration. nurse (N2) said: \"the working environment is poor since we sit in the wards with patients all day long\" a study that was done by Kieft et al. showed improved hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue. the findings of this study show there was a more negative practice environment in the TB wards than a positive one. this leads to negative practice by the nurses, since they are afraid to contract diseases. physical environment was poor and TB ward designs were not conducive. a study found that improved hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue. study found that there was a more negative practice environment in the TB wards than a positive one. the findings of the present study concur with those of a study done by mametja [16], which indicated that there was a more negative practice environment in HIV/AIDS wards. some patients default because they go to traditional healers and the healers tell them that they have been bewitched; they are not really sick. some patients continue to smoke and drink alcohol and worsen their conditions as they fail to adhere to their treatment. delays in diagnosis were due to fear of stigma, patients\u2019 dissatisfaction with service from private healthcare providers, lack of knowledge, patients\u2019 beliefs, and patients choosing to consult traditional healers rather than healthcare facilities. many people in africa visit traditional healers prior or concurrently with formal healthcare services. lack of equipment and working resources hindered the provision of quality healthcare, proper conduct of tests, therapies, investigations, and surgery. a study by ten Hoeve et al. found that one of the independent functions of a nurse is education. the findings of this study show there was a lack of skills and in-service training in the wards. this finding concurs with those of a study conducted by Yang et al. [22], which indicated various barriers contributing to poor TB treatment. delays in diagnosis can be effectively achieved if individuals with the disease receive adequate and timely treatment. early diagnosis and prompt effective therapy form the key elements of the tuberculosis control programme. delays in diagnosis were due to fear of stigma, dissatisfaction with service from private healthcare providers, lack of knowledge, patients\u2019 beliefs. the performance of a health organization depends on the knowledge, skills, and motivation of individuals. it is important for employers to provide suitable working resources to ensure that the performances of employees meet the desired standards. there is a shortage of equipment and working resources impacting the quality of health in the TB wards. the quality, efficiency, and equity of services are dependent on the availability of skilled and competent health professionals. a study by ten Hoeve et al. [21] found that one of the independent functions of a nurse is education. healthcare professionals need to seek up-to-date scientific knowledge from national, international, academic and research institutions. TB is a major occupational hazard for health care workers worldwide. the transmission of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs through infected drops aerosolized by patients with active pulmonary TB. TB patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. TB patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air. TB is not usually spread by brief contact, but anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected. nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection, even when they are outside TB wards. nurses are exposed to a great risk of being infected by TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB because they do not have personal protective materials in place. the hospital also has poor infection control measures. TB patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. a person with TB disease produces the TB bacilli, and another person inhales the droplet nuclei containing the bacilli. nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection, even when they are outside TB wards and that contributes to an outbreak of TB in rural areas. nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection, even when they are outside TB wards and that contributes to an outbreak of TB. despite TB being a curable disease, in almost all new cases, professionals have indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population. TB is surrounded by intense grief, with implications to different spheres of life, including social relationships. healthcare professionals believe TB\u2019s ability to impact patients\u2019 lives and causes death has strong emotional impact on the life of a patient since it evokes disability, impotence, and self-discrimination. nurses experience stress, frustration, and pain due to the conditions of TB patients. they always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives. when a patient dies, nurses feel sad and hurt. nurses experience stress, frustration, and pain due to the conditions of TB patients. nurses always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives. when a patient dies, nurses feel sad and hurt. the following sub-themes will be discussed under support system available in the hospital. support from the managers, support from the psychologist and appreciation of staff. hospitals are widely accepted as the most influential force in staff satisfaction and retention because of their role in work environments. nurses seem to be overexposed to a range of psychosocial stressors. it is important that they receive psychological support regularly in order for them to cope in their working environment and remain productive. TB nurses feel unappreciated for what they are doing. the hospital does not celebrate TB day as a way of appreciating nurses as pioneers in the hospitals who risk their lives in order to fight TB disease. nursing managers are the vital link between hospital senior executives and direct care nurses. lack of support from the management confuses the nursing staff and causes staff to lose interest in their job. nurses seem to be overexposed to a range of psychosocial stressors. it is important that they receive psychological support regularly in order to cope in their working environment and remain productive. nurses are on the front line of fighting diseases in the world.
