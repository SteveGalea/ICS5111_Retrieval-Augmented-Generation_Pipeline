{"summary": "Ixodes pacificus ticks are the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi. I. pacificus ticks are also vectors for several other vector-borne pathogens. PCR/ESI-MS can also detect novel and uncharacterized organisms. PCR amplicons were analyzed by electrospray ionization followed by time of flight mass spectrometry system (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines IL) the base count of the amplicons can be determined and compared to a database to identify the organism(s) present.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in only 3 of the 982 ticks tested. this signature is consistent with the detection of a novel Anaplasmataceae species. three representative tick samples containing this signature were selected for DNA sequence analysis. the four loci sequenced were chosen to clarify the relationship of the novel species with named Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and \u2018Candidatus Neoehrlichia\u2019 species. the observed deviations from the reference genome sequence in the 16S rRNA gene (1 SNP) and gltA (2 SNPs) were shared with independent sequences of California isolates of A. phagocytophilum (AF172167, AF304137) these differences are mostly likely unique to isolates from California. previously characterized Anaplasma species share 95.2% identity across the 16S rRNA gene. previously characterized Anaplasma species share over 95.2% identity across the 16S rRNA gene and only 90.4% to 92.9% identity with Ehrlichia species. all ticks tested were adults except for 126 nymphal ticks collected at a single site in Sonoma County. the Rickettsia endosymbiont of I. pacificus was detected in 96.9% (952/982) of the ticks tested. at least one tick-borne microorganism was detected in 14.9% of the ticks surveyed (146/982). 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 75 BCT348 BCT3515 BCT1083 BCT1084 (gltA) (rpoB) (16S rRNA) (23S rRNA) (rnpB) (rnpB) the only species detected in California ticks was B. odocoilei. not all of the specimens were tested due to limited nucleic acid extracts. this organism is known to be transmitted by Ixodes scapularis. the PCR/ESI-MS signature of this novel bacterium was similar to that of A. phagocytophilum. three representative tick samples containing this signature were selected for DNA sequence analysis. the four loci sequenced, the 16S rRNA gene, gltA, groEL and rpoB, were chosen. the four gene sequences of the A. phagocytophilum isolate had 99.4% to 100% identity to the A. phagocytophilum genome sequence (GenBank NC_007797) the observed deviations from the reference genome sequence in the 16S rRNA gene (1 SNP) and gltA (2 SNPs) were shared with independent sequences of California isolates of A. phagocytophilum (AF172167, AF304137) 16S rRNA sequence from our novel Anaplasmataceae bacterium shared 93.4% to 94.2% identity with characterized Anaplasma species. previously characterized Anaplasma species share over 95.2% identity across the 16S rRNA gene and only 90.4% to 92.9% identity with characterized Ehrlichia species. PCR primers are capable of detecting and distinguishing a wide range of Borrelia species including B. americana, B. bissettii, and B. californiensis previously detected in I. pacificus ticks. only B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi were observed in this study. the most prevalent organism we found in the ticks was a previously undescribed Anaplasmataceae species. the base count signature of this novel species was detected in 4.9% of ticks analyzed. the 16S rRNA sequence was found to share a maximum of 94.2% identify with any named Anaplasma species. the average identity computed between the novel California isolate and the established Anaplasma species is 93.6%, 84.7%, 58.6% and 83.0% across the same loci. the divergence seen between the established genera Ehrlichia and \u2018Candidatus Neoehrlichia\u2019 is greater than the divergence seen between the established genera Ehrlichia and \u2018Candidatus Neoehrlichia\u2019. the bacterium identified in the present study represents a lineage distinct from known Anaplasma species. further studies are needed to culture this organism and to determine its range of hosts. members of the -Proteobacteria placed phylogenetically within the family Anaplasmataceae. not cultivated.
