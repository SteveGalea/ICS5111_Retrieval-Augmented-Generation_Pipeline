{"summary": "a multi-author report entitled \u2018Highlights of the 30th International Conference on antiviral research\u2019 gave an overview of a broad range of the ICAR presentations. this meeting report gives detailed accounts of the lectures by the recipients of ISAR\u2019s three major awards held in memory of Gertrude (Trudy) Elion, Antonn (Tony) Hol and William (Bill) Prusoff. viral hepatitis is a major, worldwide clinical problem. about 170 million chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 350 million with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the united states, the burden of mortality with viral hepatitis due to HBV had been falling steadily. in the same period, the mortality due to HIV was less than one per 100,000 each year. the NS5B polymerase is highly conserved across all HCV genotypes. the highly active, critical nature of the polymerase active site means any mutations resistant to nucleoside/tide drugs are likely to reduce polymerase efficiency and hence the fitness of the mutated virus. in a 14-day monotherapy phase II study in HCV GT1 non-responder patients, there was a 2.7 log10 reduction in HCV RNA levels. the high doses and the twice-daily dosing regimen were of concern which were unlikely to be overcome by the prodrug approach. the phosphoramidate approach is well known but there are side chains which can influence the properties of the prodrug. the concept of liver targeting using phosphoramidates was never contemplated. the ELECTRON Phase II clinical study became known as \u2018The Game Changer\u2019 because it was the first ever study in which HCV therapy, without IFN, had given 100% sustained viral response for 24 weeks (SVR24) sofosbuvir-based cure regimens have been shown to be effective in patients co-infected with HIV, in previously difficult-to-treat patients \u2013 African Americans, in cirrhotic patients, in those with decompensated liver disease and in liver transplant patients. long-term therapy with nucleoside/tide analogues has given good control of HBV replication. preferred therapies have been entecavir and tenofovir. the latter now being replaced by the new prodrug tenofovir alafenamide. ARB-1740 has modified oligonucleotide chemistry and changes in the HBV sites targeted. in both HBeAg positive and negative patients, there was 0.5 log10 reduction in HBsAg levels. multistep enantiomeric syntheses were devised for d- and l-1,3-dioxolane nucleosides, starting from d-mannose and l-glucose. the d-dioxolanes led to two compounds (DAPD and DOT) with activity against HIV and the l-dioxolanes included a compound (l-BHDU) active against herpesviruses. interest in 1-(-d-d-dioxolane)thymine (DOT) was stimulated when it was discovered that it retained its anti-HIV activity. resistance profile for DOT was done in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using cloned HIV with known resistance mutations. l-BHDU does not interfere with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolism. this became an important toxicity issue when BVdU and 5-FU were co-administered to cancer patients. hepatitis virus (WHV) in woodchucks (n = 4/group), l-FMAU (clevudine) at various doses was administered for 28 days and the levels of serum WHV DNA (pg/ml) were followed for 16 weeks. with the lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg), WHV DNA remained undetectable to week 14, then low levels were detected at week 16. FMCA was tested in a cell culture HBV DNA replication assay against both wild-type (wt), lamivudine-resistant strains (M204V, M204I, L180M and L180M/M204V) and adefovir-resistant strain (M236T) both FMCA and its phosphoramidate prodrug retained good activity (1.2- and 0.9-fold) FMCA appears to have a good safety profile, having minimal inhibitory effects on cellular and mitochondrial DNA replication. further in vivo evaluation of FMCA-P is ongoing. such drugs will play a vital role in controlling HBV replication while minimising drug resistance. the consortium was set up in 2014 with funding from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. the four projects are on flaviviruses, alphaviruses, coronaviruses and influenza. there are monthly teleconferences and face-to-face meetings at least once a year. the administration core includes Rich Whitley, Mary Wyatt Bowers and maaike herself. the need for data has to be explained \u2013 data on ALL compounds are required to determine structure\u2013activity relationships. there must be free exchange of data and engagement of the whole team. the flavivirus entry viral glycoprotein (E) has clear biochemical functions. it is closely related to west Nile, Zika and other pathogenic flaviviruses. the flavivirus entry viral glycoprotein (E) is a pre-fusion dimer on the surface of virions. coside, identified a potential drug-binding pocket located between domains I and II. phenotypic screens were used to find inhibitors of dengue virus entry. these were then screened for compounds likely to affect this process through interactions with E. resistance to 7-148-6 was obtained at passage 4 due to a single mutation, E-M196V, located in the detergent-binding pocket. this mutation reduces the affinity of recombinant E for all three series of inhibitors. additional point substitutions in the pocket were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. eight new scaffolds that inhibit dengue virus by binding to E were found. IC50 values for inhibition of the ALPHAscreen assay were well correlated with EC90 values for antiviral activity. the fusion inhibitors have also been used to define the stoichiometry for inhibiting E-mediated fusion of virus-like particles. ICAR Keynote lecture focused on the fast developing story of RV-C species. first discovered in the 1950s, two types of RV were recognised, RV-A and RV-B. RV-C was associated with children with asthma exacerbations. about 70% of the particles contained RNA (full), the other particles being empty. the full and empty particles of RV-C had spikes formed by VP-1. in modern humans, there are two forms of CDHR3, Tyr529 and Cys529 (CDHR3 Y529 and CDHR3 C529, respectively) children with genes encoding Tyr/Cys CDHR3 had intermediate risk. proportions of patients with asthma were 67, 3 and 29%, respectively. the emergence of RV-C may explain why the Cys529 protein has become so dominant in the modern human population. it does not account for the early appearance of this variant in ancient human DNA prior to \u2018out of Africa\u2019. a phylogenetic tree was created in collaboration with Nels Elde and Alesia McKeown. the polio laboratory at CDC serves as the lead centre for the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network supporting the global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, there were about 350,000 cases/year in 125 countries \u2013 by the 2000 target year, there were less than 3000 cases. polioviruses can evolve rapidly during prolonged replication of OPV in immunocompromised subjects. mutation rate is faster than that for HIV, influenza viruses and HCV. some mutations in OPV are under negative selection pressure to revert towards the wt. in the period 2010\u20132016, over 50 cases were reported (cf. 10 in 1980\u20131989). majority of shedders are derived from the type 2 attenuated virus within the OPV. 67% only type 2 and 72% when including co-infection with either type 1 or 3. pocapavir (V-073, capsid inhibitor, preventing viral RNA release) and V-7404 (3C protease inhibitor (PI) have the potential to be progressed quickly. both compounds have known cell culture activity against poliovirus, preclinical bioavailability and safety profile data. it is necessary to determine the resistance profile in the target iVDPV population. pocapavir and V-7404 were tested in cell culture assays. it was confirmed that the combination results in a marked reduction of viral resistance frequency. newly infected partners have been followed for up to eight years. NIH-funded work is also supported by the international AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) the proportion retaining more than 300 CD4 cells/mm3 was 100%, about 25% and virtually 0%. the high VL group reached the end point within three years (p = 0.001) the transmitted virus is derived from a viral quasi-species that has evolved in its chronically infected host. this is because in the infecting partner, the HLA-directed cellular immune response leads to the selection of escape mutations. this is because in the infecting partner, the cellular immune response leads to the selection of escape mutations. pei-Yong Shi is a key speaker at the 2017 ICAR. he has considered two possible approaches to produce an attenuated vaccine with a good safety profile. he compared vaccines with 10-, 20- and two different 30-nucleotide deletions. the 10-del ZIKV seemed to be more attenuated than both a 20- or 30-nucleotide deletion vaccines. this may be due to the 10-del ZIKV being more susceptible to IFN than the other deletion vaccines. in mice infected with wt virus, the viraemia was over 6 log10 PFU/ml at day 4. in the vaccinated mice, the viraemia was undetectable on day 4 but similar to the control group on days 5, 6 and 7. this low-dose vaccine group had similar antibody titres at day 28. in the wt groups, there was a dose\u2013response but there were some deaths even at the lowest dose. in the vaccine groups, there were no deaths, even at the highest dose. the vaccine efficacy was evaluated in male mice. viraemia on day 30 (two days after challenge) were high in the challenged-placebo group. the virus levels in the testis tissue were high in the challenged-placebo group. the sperm counts were low in the challenged-placebo group. the placebo group had neither viraemia nor antibodies until after the virus challenge. in the 20-del ZIKA vaccine group, 2/3 had low levels of viraemia and 3/3 with high antibody levels from day 14 onwards. an ICAR Keynote lecture focused on the fast developing story of RV-C species. first discovered in the 1950s, two types of RV were recognised, RV-A and RV-B. RV-C was detected in 60% of children with asthma exacerbations versus 24% with either RV-A or RV-B. 14% with another virus without RV and 8% with no virus detected. in modern humans, there are two forms of CDHR3, Tyr529 and Cys529 (CDHR3 Y529 and CDHR3 C529, respectively) children with genes encoding Tyr/Cys CDHR3 had intermediate risk. the proportion of patients with asthma were 67, 3 and 29%. the new samples included the first genome-wide ancient DNA (8500\u20133000 years before present) from Anatolian Neolithic farmers. 25% had the Cys529 variant and 75% had the Tyr529 form. in modern times, the majority of humans have both genes for the Cys529 protein. the polio laboratory at CDC serves as the lead centre for the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network supporting the global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, there were about 350,000 cases/year in 125 countries \u2013 by the 2000 target year, there were less than 3000 cases. each year, this low number of cases has continued to decline. polioviruses can evolve rapidly, the RNA replication error rate is 104/cycle. in an individual, there are about 1 or 2 base substitutions/week, giving an overall evolution rate of about 1%/year. most mutations will generate synonymous codons that do not alter the protein coding. iVDPV shedders are being identified at a greater rate due to improved surveillance. the majority of shedders are derived from the type 2 attenuated virus within the OPV, 67% only type 2 and 72% when including co-infection with either type 1 or 3. pocapavir (V-073, capsid inhibitor, preventing viral RNA release) and V-7404 (PI) have the potential to be progressed quickly. both compounds have known cell culture activity against poliovirus, preclinical bioavailability and safety profile data. this challenge study were that pocapavir was well tolerated and had significant activity but that there was a high incidence of drug resistance which appeared rapidly and was transmitted to some of the placebo group. it was confirmed that the combination results in a marked reduction of viral resistance frequency. newly infected partners have been followed for up to eight years. new partners have been followed for up to eight years. NIH-funded work is also supported by the international AIDS Vaccine Initiative. individuals followed for five years, starting with widely varying set point VLs. for individuals with low vRC, intermediate vRC and high vRC virus, the proportion retaining more than 300 CD4 cells/mm3 were 100%, about 25% and virtually 0%. high vRC virus is linked to enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines. this is linked to increased viral burden in nave CD4+ T cells and CD4+ memory T cells. this finding is linked to significantly faster decline of CD4 cells. reversal is not possible because of the adaptive immune system. pei-Yong Shi is a key speaker at the 2017 ICAR. he has considered two possible approaches to produce an attenuated vaccine with a good safety profile. his target enzyme was methyltransferase, which enables the Zika virus to acquire a cap to protect the viral RNA. 10-, 20- and 30-nucleotide deletions seemed to be more attenuated. this may be due to the 10-del ZIKV being more susceptible to IFN. the reason for the differing IFN responses is not known. in mice infected with wt virus, the viraemia was over 6 log10 PFU/ml at day 4. in the vaccinated mice, the viraemia was undetectable on day 4. the viraemia was similar to the control group on days 5, 6 and 7. intracerebral inoculation using a range of doses (10, 100, 1000 and 10,000 IFU) in the wt groups, there were no deaths, even at the highest dose. vaccine efficacy was evaluated in male mice. ted group and one of the placebo groups were challenged with ZIKV. Viraemia on day 30 were high in the challenged-placebo group. the virus levels in the testis tissue were high in the challenged-placebo group. infected control group had high viraemia, high antibody levels from day 14. placebo group had neither viraemia nor antibodies until after virus challenge. wt virus infected half (20/36) of mosquitoes. for several years, ICAR has included at least one Keynote lecture, this year there were four. all eight speakers gave excellent presentations, each on a different topic. each gave excellent presentations, each on a different topic. drugs with the highest genetic barriers were nucleoside/tide analogues. but not all nucleoside/tide analogues have a high genetic barrier. a good safety profile is just as important as a good activity. the uridine analogue (PSI-6206-TP) was less potent than the cytidine analogue (PSI-6130-TP) as an inhibitor of the HCV polymerase. the 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily. the second crucial decision was to select the half-life as the more important parameter. ka vaccine (Pei-Yong Shi) has been selected for progression. standard therapy is with TAF, an excellent nucleotide-analogue drug. but it does not eliminate viral cccDNA or the production of VPs. resistance to (S)-HPMPDAP appeared in two strains of camelpox virus after passingaging 30 times, taking 18 months, before resistant clones could be obtained. Priscilla\u2019s group prepared various dengue mutant viruses containing point substitutions. none of the current compounds were active against all these mutant strains. the protease substrate is no longer inhibited by the PIs. the \u2018back door escape route\u2019 is not available to the viral polymerases. careful combinations of nucleoside/tide analogues have given the drug therapies with the highest genetic barriers. the greatest medical need is to treat those SCID patients in whom poliovirus infection has continued for many years. experience with other long-lasting chronic infections indicates that drug therapy requires a combination of drugs, which includes at least one nucleoside/tide inhibitor with a genetic barrier to resistance. maaike described the pros and cons of various collaborations involving different organisations. her talk reminds me of the time when I started work at Beechams in 1969. she joined a newly formed multidisciplinary antiviral team."}
