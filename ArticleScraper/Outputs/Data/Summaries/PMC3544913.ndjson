{"summary": "the factors associated with switching at 180 days were evaluated by multivariate regression analyses. thiazide diuretics had the highest switching rate (5.6%), followed by ACEIs (4.5%), CCBs (4.4%) and beta-blockers (3.2%). study among 25,196 urban adults aged 18\u201374 years in northeast of china showed the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 40.5% [5], which conferred increased cardiovascular risks [6]\u2013[7]. hypertension has also been evaluated as the most contributory component of metabolic syndrome in the association with ischemic heart disease in Taiwanese Type 2 Diabetic Patients [8]. studies have previously reported the rates of switching among antihypertensive agents in Chinese adults. age, gender, visit type (new clinic visitors vs. follow-up consultation), number of comorbidities and socioeconomic status were significant factors determining switching. the HA provides free or low-cost primary and secondary care services to the public. clinical guidelines are provided to all physicians regarding the need to enter diagnosis of the consultation in the form of ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codes. over 7 million, a median age of 39 years, roughly equal number of males and females, and a median household income of US$2,240 [28] Definition of the Cohort We included all adult patients aged 18 years or older who attended any public healthcare services in Hong Kong during the study period from January 2001 to December 2005. those who started medications in 2004 were not included in our analysis as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic heavily affected the public healthcare system, limiting medication refill in that year. drug switching group and non switching group were compared on the basis of sociodemographic variables. the classes of antihypertensive drugs prescribed included thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers [CCB] and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Incorporation, Chicago Illinois) version 16.0. all p values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. this study used the Clinical Data Analysis Reporting System (CDARS) of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. patients are assessed by medical social workers who determine their inability to pay medical consultation fees. each consultation costs US$5.77 including investigation and prescription fees unless a fee waiver applies. the data used in this study includes information from all patients in the whole Territory of Hong Kong. drug switching is defined as the absence of a refill prescription in all subsequent clinic visits combined with the prescription of another antihypertensive drug within 180 days since the date of the first prescription. a longer time (180 days) has been used instead of 90 days, taking into account the practice of prescribing antihypertensive drugs for a period of more than 90 days. over all clinic visits was used. the selection of independent variables was hypothesis-driven. all predictor variables were entered unconditionally into the regression equations. switcher non-switcher Overall Excluded# N = 6163 N = 153650 N = 159,813 N = 63,474 Age * 49 991 (2.6%) 36517 (97.4%) 37508 (23.8%) 24563 (38.7%) 50\u201359 1313 (3.9%) 32252 (96.1%) 33565 (21.0%) 9488 (15.0%) 60\u201369 1452 (4.2%) 32992 (95.8%) 34444 (2 ACEI1 838 (4.5%) 17783 (95.5%) 18621 (11.7%) 4379 (47.8%) alpha-Blockers 196 (2.1%) 9301 (97.9%) 9497 (5.9%) 3958 (6.2%) beta-Blockers 2145 (3.2%) 65701 (96.8%) 67846 (42.5%) 30829 (48.6%) CCB2 2192 (4.4%) 47780 (95.6%) 49972 (31.3%) 156 # 27,238 visited the clinic setting only once, 4,391 were prescribed more than one antihypertensive agent. 31,845 stayed in the cohort for less than 180 days including die within the first 180 days. systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were also included as covariates. .67, 0.75)* 0.65 (0.61, 0.70)* 0.37 (0.27, 0.51)* Payment status Public assistance 1.07 (0.99, 1.14) 0.92 (0.85, 0.99)* 0.94 (0.87, 1.03) 0.93 (0.85, 1.02) Others 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 service type In-/Day- Patient 1.25 (1.07, 1.47)* 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) 1.02 (0.85, 1.22) 1.14 CCB 0.97 (0.90, 1.06) 0.97 (0.89, 1.05) 1.01 (0.90, 1.12) 1.01 (0.90, 1.12) Thiazide 1.25 (1.13, 1.38)* 1.39 (1.25, 1.55)* 1.49 (1.31, 1.69)* 1.48 (1.31, 1.69)* Co-morbidity (diagnosed within 180 days) No 1.00 1.00 1.00 Yes 1.64 (1.55, 1.73)* the association between antihypertensive drug class and switching remained statistically similar when propensity score was included in the regression analysis. the total eligible sample size was 159,813, and the characteristics of the patients excluded were shown in Table 1.
