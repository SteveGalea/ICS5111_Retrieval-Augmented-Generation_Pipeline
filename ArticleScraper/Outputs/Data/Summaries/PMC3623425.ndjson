{"summary": "Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that colonizes different areas of the human body. it can become pathogenic and cause local or systemic infections in immunocompromised subjects. neutropenia is a hallmark risk factor for development of disseminated candidasis. human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are more susceptible to mucosal candidiasis (1, 2). Xin et al. have recently reported a TT-coupled self-adjuvanting glycopeptide vaccine (17); whether such a vaccine could also overcome the requirement for T-cell help remains to be tested. a protein resulting from fusion between rCRT/39\u2013272 and recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (rEGFP) is able to induce anti-EGFP IgG Abs in not only BALB/c but also athymus nude the spike protein (S450\u2013650) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was also able to induce S450\u2013650-specific IgG in mice (27) on the basis of these data, we wondered if CRT/39\u2013272 could be used as an effective carrier or adjuvant for carbohydrate antigens and assist the production of glycotope-specific IgG Abs. laminarin (Sigma-Aldrich) (15 mg) was incubated with 4 mM sodium periodate\u20131.5 ml PBS (pH = 7.0) in the dark for 1.5 h at room temperature. the mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) and lyophilized. pore-size sterile syringe filter passed twice through a polymyxin B column (Sigma-Aldrich) the endotoxin levels were less than 1 ng/mg. the resultant cells were over 95% positive for surface CD19/B220 (double staining) and CD3, respectively. for the last 8 h of incubation, the cells were pulsed with 0.2 Ci/well of [3H]thymidine (Atom HighTech); the cultures were subsequently harvested on an automatic cell harvester (Tomtec) the concentration of IgM in cell culture supernatant after 48 h was determined using a mouse IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantitation set. the wells were washed five times with PBS-T containing 0.05% Tween 20. then 100 l of diluted mouse sera was added into the well. the reaction was developed with 100 l of O-phenylenediamine (OPD) for 5 min. fungus cultured in yeast form in liquid Winge medium at 28\u00b0C. washed twice in saline solution, counted in a hemocytometer. resuspended to desired concentration in sterile saline solution. the number of CFU per organ was determined by a plate dilution method on Sabouraud dextrose agar. each kidney was examined separately, and at least three distinct dilutions from each sample were assayed in triplicate. laminarin (15 mg) was incubated with 4 mM sodium periodate\u20131.5 ml PBS. mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) and lyophilized. cyanoborohydride was added to achieve a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. splenocytes were freshly collected from nave BALB/c mice or nude mice. the resultant cells were over 95% positive for surface CD19/B220 (double staining) and CD3 respectively. the concentration of IgM in cell culture supernatant after 48 h was determined using a mouse IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantitation set. the wells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then 100 l of diluted mouse sera was added into the well. washes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, or IgG3 antibody (SouthernBiotech) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was developed with 100 l of O-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min and stopped with 100 l of suspensions were inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 30 min, washed, and stored at 4\u00b0C for no more than 1 week. a total of 150 C. albicans germ tubes were incubated in 200 l of RPMI-fetal calf serum (FCS) medium in the presence of sera (undiluted or diluted 1:10) from LAM-CRT-immunized mice. all experiments were repeated at least three times. differences were considered statistically significant at a P of 0.05. laminarin was conjugated with rCRT/39\u2013272 or rEGFP. samples of laminarin, rCRT/39\u2013272, rEGFP, LAM-EGFP, and a mixture of laminarin and rEGFP were run in 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. freshly fractionated B and T cells from nave BALB/c mouse splenocytes were stimulated, in triplicate, with rCRT/39\u2013272 or rEGFP (10 g/ml plenocytes were used as responder cells in parallel experiments. rCRT/39\u2013272 was able to drive B-cell activation and proliferation. splenocytes from nave athymic nude mice effectively activated by LAM-CRT. LAM-CRT was a better immunogen than LAM-EGFP in eliciting laminarin-specific IgG responses in vivo. titers of laminarin-specific IgG1 Abs in mice immunized with LAM-CRT were approximately 16-fold higher than that of the LAM-EGFP-immunized group. anti-mouse IgM or IgG were assayed in laminarin-based ELISAs. antisera from all 3 groups were also titrated against laminarin using HRP-labeled IgG1-specific Abs. only LAM-CRT, but not laminarin or LAM-EGFP, was able to induce laminarin-specific IgG responses. laminarin-specific memory B cells seemed to be generated by LAM-CRT immunization in nude mice, since an elevated response to a booster dose was seen. ELISAs were based on carbohydrate antigens including dextran, pustulan, linear -1,3-glucan, laminarin, mannan, alginic acid, and heparin. glucan-specific IgG Abs were then affinity purified from the antisera using a laminarin column. affinity-purified IgG Abs were incubated with either laminarin or dextran (100 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the yeast cells were stained with affinity-purified Abs preincubated with laminarin (100 g/ml) Vaccination with LAM-CRT confers protective immunity against C. albicans infection. BALB/c mice were immunized twice with LAM-CRT or rCRT/39\u2013272 alone as a control, followed by a lethal-dose i.v. challenge with viable C. albicans 28 days later. viable yeast cells in the kidneys were quantitated using the plate dilution method. the results were calculated using the \u201cNMS\u201d wells as a reference. the results are expressed as mean percent growth inhibition SD. the saccharide/protein ratios of LAM-CRT and LAM-EGFP were estimated to be 0.75 and 0.7, respectively, reflecting high conjugation efficiency. samples of laminarin, rCRT/39\u2013272, rEGFP, LAM-EGFP, and a mixture of laminarin and rEGFP were run in 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. freshly prepared nave BALB/c nu/nu mouse splenocytes were used as responder cells in parallel experiments. data represent results from 3 independent experiments. rCRT/39\u2013272 was able to drive B-cell activation and proliferation and IgM production. s.c. injected twice in absence of adjuvant, while laminarin alone was hardly able to do so. titers of laminarin-specific IgG1 Abs in mice immunized with LAM-CRT were approximately 16-fold higher than that of the LAM-EGFP-immunized group. the detection antibody was HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG with OPD as the substrate. antisera from all 3 groups were also titrated against laminarin using HRP-labeled IgG1-specific Abs for detection. groups of nude mice were immunized twice with laminarin, LAM-EGFP, or LAM-CRT. only LAM-CRT, but not laminarin or LAM-EGFP, was able to induce laminarin-specific IgG responses. the fine specificity of the LAM-CRT-induced antisera was analyzed by using ELISAs based on carbohydrate antigens. laminarin and unbranched linear -1,3-glucan were recognized by IgG Abs in the LAM-CRT-induced antisera. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was employed as a detection Ab followed by development with OPD. wells not precoated with any Ags (None) were included as a control. mice were s.c. immunized twice with LAM-CRT or rCRT/39\u2013272 alone as a control, followed by a lethal-dose i.v. challenge with viable C. albicans 28 days later. antisera from the LAM-CRT-immunized mice showed effective inhibition of the growth of C. albicans cells in vitro. s.c. immunization with LAM-CRT induced high-titer anti-glucan IgG1 Abs. the Abs thus induced could inhibit the growth of C. albicans in vitro. the resultant conjugates were as effective in eliciting carbohydrate Ag-specific IgG responses in mice. despite the fact that CRT is constitutively expressed in mammalian cells, possible induction of pathological autoimmune damage in the hosts by vaccination with rCRT/39\u2013272-containing products is always of concern. results from animal experiments completed thus far suggest that this is unlikely to occur. rEGFP and rCRT/39\u2013272 were expressed in Escherichia coli with a histidine tag. rEGFP and rCRT/39\u2013272 have similar molecular masses. traditional carrier proteins such as KLH, TT, and DT are glycoproteins. rEGFP and rCRT/39\u2013272 are highly soluble. laminarin was not different from laminarin alone in the ability to elicit humoral responses in mice. presumably, LAM-CRT can activate B cells via both B-cell receptors (BCR) and CRT-binding proteins in a synergistic manner, thereby inducing IgG production in the absence of T-cell help. this finding is supported by the fact that the titer of anti-laminarin IgG in LAM- rCRT/39\u2013272 could be presented via the class II antigen-processing pathway. glucan carries a substantial advantage as a candidate vaccine antigen over other fungus-encapsulating polysaccharides such as mannan. 3-Fba (-1,2-mannotriose conjugated with a 14-mer Fba peptide derived from the N-terminal portion of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase) resulted in a self-adjuvanting vaccine that promotes robust antibody responses to disseminated candidiasis without the need for an additional adjuvant (17)."}
