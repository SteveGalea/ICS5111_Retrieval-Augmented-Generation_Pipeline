{"summary": "the Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that was discovered in 1947 near Entebbe, Uganda. it is a flavivirus that was discovered in 1947 near Entebbe, Uganda. it is a flavivirus that was associated with a mild disease characterized by fever, rash, arthritis, and conjunctivitis. ZIKV has a positive sense ssRNA genome that encodes for one large polyprotein including three structural (C, M, and E) proteins and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. most, if not all, viruses encode proteins that interfere with the activation host innate immune responses. ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protein complex promotes the degradation of Jak1. NS1, NS2B3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins inhibit expression of IFIT2 gene. NS1, NS2B, NS4A, and NS5 proteins also inhibit IFN-induced. ZIKV NS5 interacts with IKK, an important downstream kinase of the RIG-I pathway. this interaction leads to impaired ability of IKK to phosphorylate and activate IRF3 leading to reduced activation of IFN promoters. plasmids for the wild type (wt) RIG-I, wtIRF3, FLAG-tagged MAVS, FLAG-tagged MAVS, FLAG-tagged TBK-1, FLAG-tagged IKK, and FLAG-tagged HCV NS3/4A have been described previously. multiple cloning site with segment from pGEX-2T(+) bacterial expression vector. inserted segment encodes glutathione S-transferase gene and contains a thrombin recognition site and the multiple cloning site with a BamHI recognition site. antibodies Rabbit anti-IRF3 (FL-425; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser396) (4D4 guinea pig anti-ZIKV-NS5 was prepared against NS5 based on FB-GWUH-2016 sequence.

NS5 of the flavivirus NS5 is required for its inhibition activity on the RIG-I pathway. the expression of the domains was confirmed by immunoblotting. full-length NS5 and HCV NS3/4A strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the activation of IFN-1-promoter. hek293 cells were co-transfected with the RIG-I expression plasmid and IFN-1 promoter reporter constructs containing inactivating mutations. ZIKV NS3 had no inhibitory effect on either one of the mutated IFN-1 promoter constructs. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for RIG-I and ZIKV NS3 or NS5 plasmids. an expression plasmid for HCV NS3/4A was used as a control. Luc activity was measured at 24 h after transfection. ZIKV NS5 inhibited the activation of IFN-1 promoter by all the pathway components. it is noteworthy that the inhibitory effect of ZIKV NS5 on IKK overexpression-induced activation of the IFN-1 promoter was detected only with reduced amounts (from 30 ng per well to 3 ng per well) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for TBK-1, IKK, or IRF3. cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for RIG and wtIRF3. NS5 exerts an inhibitory effect on the RIG-I pathway also upstream of IRF3 phosphorylation. expression levels and the phosphorylation status of the proteins were detected with immunoblotting. HCV NS3/4A degrades MAVS to a slightly smaller protein form by HCV NS3/4A. overexpression of TBK-1 resulted in autophosphorylation of itself. luciferase assays indicated that ZIKV NS5 exerts an inhibitory function on IKK by either directly or indirectly reducing the amount and phosphorylation of IKK. the results from luciferase and immunoblot assays indicate that ZIKV NS5 exerts an inhibitory function on IKK. a non-binding protein, influenza A/Udorn/72 nucleoprotein (IAV NP), were used as positive and negative controls. MAVS did not bind to any of the three viral proteins, neither as an in vitro-translated protein nor as a cell-expressed protein. soluble cell extracts were prepared, proteins in the cell extracts were allowed to bind to immobilized GST, GST-NS5, GST-NS2 and GST-NP. the presence of MAVS, IKK, and TBK-1 were analyzed by immunoblotting. a virus strain isolated in 2015 was chosen for the expression of ZIKV structural proteins. expressed proteins were distributed in the cytoplasm. NS5 protein was localized mainly in the cell nucleus. cells were transfected with expression plasmids for various ZIKV proteins. plasmid encoding constitutively active form of RIG-I (RIG-I) encoding luciferase gene under IFN promoters. hepatitis C NS3/4A (HCV NS3/4A) inhibited RIG-I-induced IFN-1 promoter activation. none of the structural proteins had any inhibitory effect on IFN-1 promoter activation. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids for RIG-I, IFN--promoter-luciferase, ZIKV NS3 and NS5 expression plasmids. luc activity was measured at 24 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected with IFN--promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids. the same cytokines and respective amounts mentioned above were added at 24 h post transfection. d, IFN-1-promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, and ZIKV expression plasmids for NS3 and NS5 were treated with a mixture of neutralizing anti-human type I IFN antibodies that neutralizes the effect of IFN- and IFN-. NS5 showed a similarly strong 80% inhibition of IFN--induced activation of IFN-inducible MxA-promoter. the MxA-promoter-luciferase construct was used as a control. none of the cytokines activated the IFN-1 promoter, whereas MxA-promoter was readily activated in response to stimulation with increasing amounts of cytokines. these results confirm that the observed ZIKV NS5-mediated inhibition of the IFN-1 promoter is due to the interaction of ZIKV NS5 with the RIG-I pathway and not on the flavivirus NS5 proteins are composed of two functional domains: an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase, aa 1\u2013278) domain and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp, aa 276\u2013903) it has been reported that the full-length native NS5 protein is required for the inhibitory effect to occur [22] full-length ZIKV NS5 is required for the inhibitory effect on IFN-1 promoter. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RIG-I, IFN-1-promoter luciferase, and ZIKV MTase and RdRp. expression levels were detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. s for ZIKV NS3 and NS5 as well as HCV NS3/4A proteins. overexpression of RIG-I strongly activated both IRF3 and NF-B-site. ZIKV NS5 had no inhibitory effect on either one of the mutated IFN-1 promoters. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active form of IRF3. ZIKV NS3 and HCV NS3/4A were used as putatively negative and positive controls. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for RIG-I, MAVS, (C) TBK-1, (D) the constitutively active form of IRF3 (IRF3-5D) and (E, F) IKK. an expression plasmid for HCV NS3/4A was used as a control. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for (A) RIG-I (400 ng/well) and wtIRF3 (400 ng/well), (B) MAVS (400 ng/well), (C) TBK-1 (400 ng/well), (D) IKK (40 ng/well and 30 ng/well) and (E) the constitutively active form of IRF3 (400 ng/well) luciferase assays indicated that ZIKV NS5 exerts an inhibitory function on IKK by either directly or indirectly reducing the amount and phosphorylation of IKK. both HCV NS3/4A and ZIKV NS5 reduced the expression levels and phosphorylation of IKK. a known TBK1/IKK interacting protein, HCV NS2 [30], and a non-binding protein, influenza A/Udorn/72 nucleoprotein (IAV NP) were used as positive and negative controls. a clear binding of IKK to ZIKV NS5 and HCV NS2 was detected. GST, GST-NS5 (ZIKV), GST-NS2 (HCV) and GST-NP (IAV) were produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. each lane represents one-tenth of the amount of the reticulate lysate used in each binding experiment. IFN-1 is important in protecting epithelial barriers from virus infection. IFN-1 is important in protecting epithelial barriers from virus infection. unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV has the means to inhibit or delay the activation of innate immune responses. ZIKV NS5 inhibited RIG-I-induced activation of both IRF3- and NF-B transcription factors that coordinately regulate IFN-1 promoter activation. NS5 also inhibited IFN-1 promoter activation by all components of the RIG-I pathway upstream or at the level of IRF3. Xia et al. [21] reported that NS5 inhibited the activation of the promoter. NS4A suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation and NS5 was suggested to function on IRF3. NS5 inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK and IRF3. different flaviviruses are known to have different functions for the same/similar proteins. NS5 sequences of flaviviruses show up to 45% differences at amino acid level [17] allowing these proteins to have variable biological functions. lineage ZIKV strain isolated from fetal brain. NS5 seemed to reduce expression and phosphorylation of IKK. inhibitory effect of NS5 on IFN-1 promoter activation abolished. a new phenomenon of how ZIKV NS5 protein interferes with the host innate immune system providing potentially novel targets for rational drug design. in 2013, Zika virus spread to the immunologically nave population in the Americas and was found to cause severe neurological symptoms."}
