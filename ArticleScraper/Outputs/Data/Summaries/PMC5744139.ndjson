{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide variety of animals and are common in the world. they cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases with variable severity, from asymptomatic to severe. the family is one of the three viral families closely monitored in the context of emerging diseases. the aim of this study was to explore the presence of Coronaviridae in specific relevant species of wildlife in France. intestinal samples were tissues with the highest CoV RNA concentration in hedgehogs [3] and were successfully used to detect CoVs in bats, rodents, and rabbits [5]. intestinal samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C without additives. samples of hedgehog droppings were fecal samples collected in three animal shelters in 2015 and 2016. phylogenetic tree was inferred using sequences from positive samples. coronavirus sequences representing the whole diversity of the group. phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood was done using PhyML v3.0. taxa labels of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and clade grouping Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are in purple, blue, and orange respectively. Viruses detected in this study are depicted in red (HE: Sequences from hedgehogs, R: Sequences from rodents, CS: Sequences from bats; L: Sequences from rabbits) intestinal samples were taken from animals killed by hunters during rabbit hunting. no wild animal was killed specifically for the purpose of this study. fecal samples were collected in three animal shelters in 2015 and 2016. phylogenetic tree was inferred using sequences obtained from positive samples aligned with coronavirus sequences representing the whole diversity of the group. tree was also inferred using the Bayesian approach implemented in the Beast package. coronavirus RdRp sequences were aligned with original sequences from this study in SEAVIEW v4.6. a gradual color code of the tree shows significant posterior probability values. taxa labels of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and of the clade grouping Gammacoronavirus are in purple, blue, and orange. the coronavirus found in one Myotis nattereri exhibited a 95% identity with an unclassified coronavirus found in a myotis nattereri in Hungary. the nucleic sequences of the two infected animals had an identity of 99% and 98% with coronaviruses found in the same species in Bulgaria. the estimated prevalence for all the animal shelters was 50% (CI95%: 38.89; 61.11), with no statistical difference between the three animal shelters. all sequences were strongly homogeneous with a maximum of four differences at the nucleotide level. myodes glareolus NC 3/32 0/4 0/2 0/0 (3/38) 7.89 [2.72; 20.80] Arvicola terrestris NC 0/0 0/0 0/16 (0/16) 0 [0.00; 19.36] Microtus sp.

KT345294, KT345295, and KT345296 in France, KF500945 in Italy, and GQ259964 in the Netherlands clustered into these two distinct groups. the sublineage of hedgehog sequences, human MERS-CoV, camel MERS-CoV-like, and bat MERS CoV-like sister clade is different from the other beta-CoVs. study described presence of coronavirus infection in four wild mammal orders in france. results suggest that coronaviruses seem to be relatively common in these species, regardless of the place and time of sampling. studies about coronaviruses in bats are numerous in comparison with other wild mammals. the overall prevalence in bats of 2.4% (CI 95%: 1.37; 4.12) was consistent with other studies in european countries. this was the second report of Myotis emarginatus infection by coronavirus inside the usual range of this bat. study showed the circulation of beta- and alpha-CoVsin wild rabbits. most of the detected nucleic sequences were close to the beta-CoV of domestic rabbits in china [5], and the others were close to an alpha-CoV KU739072 detected from rodents in the UK [4]. the circulation of non-specific alpha-CoVs within rodents corroborates this hypothesis. the proximity of the Rodentia order to the Lagomorpha order corroborates this hypothesis. all sequences from rodents were identified as beta-CoV. coronaviruses separated by a 3.1% to 3.4% nucleotide distance in an 816-nt RdRp fragment were found. the similarity between sequences could be the result of co-evolution between viruses and hedgehogs."}
