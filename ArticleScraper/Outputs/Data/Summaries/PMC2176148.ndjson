{"summary": "up to 90% of patients in the u.s. with type 2 diabetes are either overweight or obese (2,3). obesity contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Lagerstroemia speciosa Lagerstroemia speciosa is a tropical plant found in many parts of Southeast Asia including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and southern China. it is a tree that can grow as tall as 20 m. only in the Philippines are the dried and shredded banaba leaves known to be used as a treatment for diabetes and kidney disease. 5% banaba water extract was used to feed female obese KK-Ay/Ta Jcl mice. no change in food intake was observed (20) liver triglyceride content was reduced by more than 40% in the banaba extract-treated mice. however, both the identity of the effective component(s) and the mechanism for the activity were not studied. corosolic acid (A) is a triterpenoid (21), not a tannin. Lagerstroemin (B) is an ellagitannin (22). ellagitannins were identified in the water extract of banaba. corosolic acid does not possess insulin-like glucose transport stimulatory activity. the IR mediated signaling pathway must be independent of the IR mediated signaling pathway. in 2006, the same group of researchers found corosolic acid significantly reduced blood glucose levels in KK-Ay diabetic mice. BE inhibits the adipocyte differentiation activity induced by MDI. the anti-differentiation activity is anti-insulin like, since insulin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and is a component of MDI. however, insulin is adipogenic, which is considered to be a negative side effect of insulin. cells treated with either 1 M insulin or 30 M penta-galloyl-glucose (PGG) were used as positive controls. samples were in triplicate in the experiment, and the experiment was repeated three times. no difference was found by a one-way ANOVA statistical analysis. penta-O-galloyl-D-glucopyranose (PGG) is the most effective compound in TA. the -anomer was found to be slightly more active than the -form in its glucose transport stimulatory activity. TA is known to reduce blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients. both - and -PGG possess the adipogenesis inhibitory activity exhibited by the banaba extract (28) and by TA (29) this suggests that these two activities are associated with the same molecules. both compounds may have the potential to reduce hyperglycemia without increasing adiposity. Lagerstroemia speciosa (banaba) is a tropical plant found in many parts of Southeast Asia including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and southern China. it is a tree that can grow as tall as 20 m. only in the Philippines are the dried and shredded banaba leaves known to be used as a treatment for diabetes and kidney disease. KK-Ay/Ta Jcl mice treated with banaba extract had significantly reduced body weight (10%) compared with control mice fed with a regular diet (20) no change in food intake was observed (20) liver triglyceride content was reduced by more than 40% in the banaba extract-treated mice. ellagitannins were identified in the water extract of banaba as the activators of glucose transport in fat cells with a glucose uptake assay. the researchers speculated that Lagerstroemin could act intracellularly or bind to the insulin receptor (IR) extracellularly. in 2004, a separate group of researchers found that glucose transporter 4 translocation from the intracellular microsomal membrane to the plasma membrane was significantly increased in the muscle cells of mice treated orally with corosolic acid. corosolic acid significantly reduces blood glucose levels and plasma insulin levels in KK-Ay diabetic mice (26). in 2006, the same group of researchers found that corosolic acid significantly lowered blood glucose levels at the 90 min mark in an oral glucose tolerance test done on type 2 diabetic patients (27). however, no statistical difference was found for any other time point during the test. be differs from insulin in that it is anti-adipogenic whereas insulin is adipogenic, which is considered to be a negative side effect of insulin. tannins comprise up to 40% of the material in the extract, but the remaining extract was not able to induce glucose transport. negative (vehicle) control and corosolic acid samples were repeated three times. no difference was found between negative (vehicle) control and negative (vehicle) control. corosolic acid-based banaba extract product glucosol (30) annins (tannic acid, A) and PGG (B) exist in two anomeric forms. TA is known to effectively reduce blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients. TA was found to be much more potent and efficacious than the ellagitannin Lagerstroemin (29). both compounds may have the potential to reduce hyperglycemia without increasing adiposity. both compounds may have the potential to reduce hyperglycemia without increasing adiposity, a desirable combination of properties that insulin lacks. tannins were identified as the effective component for the insulin like glucose transport inducing activity in banaba extract. the most effective tannin molecule in the extract has not been identified. a well designed bioassay (glucose uptake assay) guided isolation should be able to complete this task."}
