{"summary": "nearly two-thirds of EIDs are zoonotic and three-quarters originate in wildlife. targeted disease surveillance may be useful to optimize prevention and control measures and reduce the threat of future zoonotic EIDs. pathogens from a published database of 335 emerging infectious disease \u201cevents\u201d from 1940 to 2004. this database includes EID events caused by newly evolved strains of pathogens, novel pathogens that have entered human populations for the first time. we excluded emergence events that arose through the evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance and those caused by newly evolved strains of known pathogens. zoonotic diseases are more likely to be transmitted through specific pathways. each pathogen in the analysis received a total value of 1. for organisms that could only be transmitted through one pathway (e.g., rabies), that pathway received the full value of 1 (assuming transmission would occur via that pathway 100% of the time) if a pathogen could be transmitted via multiple \u201cunlikely\u201d or \u201crare\u201d pathways, the value of 0.1 was split equally between those pathways. the most common mode of transmission reported is airborne transmission via inhalation of aerosols from contaminated soil or animal waste. more rare modes of transmission to humans include tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products. to calculate which pathways were associated with each EID driver, we split the data into subsets by driver, summed the weights for each transmission category, and divided the sum by the total number of EID events per driver. to minimize the probability of detecting false positives, we selected a rejection alpha of 0.10. the majority of zoonotic EIDs were viral and bacterial in origin. for viruses, transmission was most likely to occur through the foodborne and vector-borne pathways. the majority of rickettsial and protozoal infections were likely transmitted through vectors, whereas the direct contact and airborne pathways were most relevant for fungal diseases. the most relevant pathway is oral transmission (58%) for food industry change, the most relevant pathway is oral transmission (58%) for food industry change, the most relevant pathway is oral transmission (58%) (Fig. 2). Pairwise permutation t-Test Results Comparing the Difference in Documented Pathways Between All Possible Pairwise Disease Drivers (121 Possible Combinations) emergence of pandemic zoonoses, zoonotic viruses of pandemic potential, and those of regional concern make targeting of surveillance programs a crucial tool for combating pandemics. this approach may have value for targeted surveillance of pathogens known to emerge through different pathways. land-use change is the leading driver for emerging zoonoses. disease emergence in regions under pressure from land use change has most often occurred through the vector-borne pathway and direct animal contact. zoonotic disease emergence is likely to increase in the future. climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to a higher incidence of food-borne (shellfish poisoning) and water-borne infectious diseases. changes in climate have also been shown to affect disease transmission of many vector-borne diseases by shifting the vector's geographic range, increasing reproductive and biting rates and shortening the incubation period. supplementary material Supplemental data Supp_Table1.pdf (62.1KB, pdf) Acknowledgments This study was made possible by the generous support of the american people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT. the contents are the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government."}
