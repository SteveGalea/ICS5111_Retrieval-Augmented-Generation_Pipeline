{"summary": "a total of 56 Swiss Webster Crl:CFW (SW), 42 C57Bl/6NCrl BR, and 40 BALB/cAnNCrl mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA) sentinel mice are tested quarterly and remain negative for mouse parvovirus, minute virus of mice, mouse norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, polyomavirus Disinfectant A was 10% bleach (The Clorox Company, Oakland, CA), an aqueous solution of 5.25% to 8% sodium hypochlorite diluted 1:10 in tap water. Disinfectant B was Accel TB (Virox Technologies, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), a ready-to-use formulation of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide combined with a surfactant accelerant. those tested included the self-inactivating lentivirus RRL-CMV-GFP (4.3 108 Infectious Units (IU)/mL), adenovirus ad-CMV-GFP (2.1 1011 IU/mL), and adeno-associated viral vector AAV-2 IRES-GFP (2.7 107 IU/mL) the initial stock of adenovirus was diluted to a concentration of 4.2 109 IU/m cells were exposed to serial dilutions (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000 in CCM) after 8 h of incubation, the diluted disinfectant mixture was aspirated from the plated cells and replaced with fresh CCM. at 24, 48, or 72 h after exposure, the cells were incubated in cell dissociation buffer (TC 10, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) negative controls were expected to yield viral concentrations of 4.2 105 IU/mL, 4.3 104 IU/mL, and 2.7 103IU/mL for adenoviral, lentiviral, and adeno-associated viral vectors. the cells were incubated for another 60 to 70 h at 37 \u00b0C. the addition of 75, 50, or 25 L of disinfectant would yield 75, 50, and 25% concentrations of the disinfectant. after 1 min of exposure, the virus\u2013disinfectant mixture was diluted 1000-fold in CCM, plated, incubated, and analyzed. this protocol was repeated 3 times, by using a fresh sample of disinfectant and aliquot of virus each time. a clear plastic, acrylic 3-chamber apparatus was custom built by the UCLA psychology Technical Services. the apparatus consisted of 3 identical chambers, one central and 2 side, separated by 2 walls. each disinfectant agent was sprayed on one of the side chambers and tap water was sprayed on the other side. the 3-chamber apparatus was used for testing innate aversion. mice were preexposed to either disinfectant A or B for 15 min each day for 3 consecutive days prior to the aversion test using the same disinfectant from the preexposure phase. aversion testing results were conducted using SPSS (version 20, IBM, Armonk, NY), with aNOVA of the preference ratio followed by least squares different posthoc comparisons when justified. for analysis across all 3 mouse strains, the factors of disinfectant, strain, and agent side were included in the ANOVA. mice were socially housed in polycarbonate cages on corncob bedding. the animal room was environmentally controlled, with a temperature of 68 to 79 \u00b0F (20.0 to 26.1 \u00b0C), relative humidity between 30% and 70%, and 12:12-h light:dark cycle. disinfectants A through D were oxidants, whereas disinfectant E was a denaturant. each disinfectant requiring reconstitution or dilution was made fresh on the day of exposure. HEK-293T cells were plated at 2 104 cells per well on 12-well plates. cells were incubated for approximately 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were then exposed to serial dilutions of each test disinfectant or negative control. HEK-293T cells were incubated for 24 h as previously described. we placed 10-L aliquots of viral vectors into 2-mL microfuge tubes. 90 L of a disinfectant at the recommended concentration was added to each tube, yielding a 90% concentration of disinfectant. the data were analyzed by using FlowJo cytometric analytical software. a baseline of 0.5% GFP expression was established as a cutoff. the detected expression was considered to be zero. adenoviral vector was suspended at a ratio of 10 L per 90 L of CCM. the viral suspensions were allowed to dry onto the plates for approximately 24 h. for each exposure, 300 L of disinfectant was added to each well. for each exposure, 300 L of disinfectant was then immediately diluted. resuspended cells were counted with a cell counter (TC 10, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after a 10-min incubation with 5 L of propidium iodide. we then placed 10-L aliquots of viral vectors into 2-mL microfuge tubes. 90 L of a disinfectant at the recommended concentration was added to each tube. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. the data were analyzed by using FlowJo cytometric analytical software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) adenoviral vector was suspended at a ratio of 10 L per 90 L of CCM. the resultant 100-L aliquots of CCM containing 4.2 107 IU of adenovirus were placed in the wells of a 12-well plate. the viral suspensions were allowed to dry onto the plates for approximately 24 h. the apparatus was placed in a dimly lit room measuring 5 Lux. each disinfectant agent was sprayed on one of the side chambers. tap water was sprayed on the other side of the apparatus. the mice were first placed in the central chamber with the side doors closed. mice were preexposed to either disinfectant A or B for 15 min each day for 3 consecutive days prior to the aversion test using the same disinfectant. a follow-up experiment was conducted in which mice were preexposed to either disinfectant A or B for 15 min each day for 3 consecutive days prior to the aversion test. disinfectant as a factor and the following groups: tap-water control, disinfectant A, preexposure to disinfectant A, disinfectant B, and preexposure to disinfectant B. 2 BALB/c mice were excluded from the behavior study for failing to spend more than 30 s exploring either side chambers. the percentage of HEK-293T cells expressing GFP was negligible and did not vary significantly from the baseline GFP expression of cells unexposed to viral vectors. similar results were obtained when adenovirus was treated with disinfectants. serum was used to dilute disinfectants to 75% of recommended concentration. at 75% concentration, exposure to disinfectants A and D resulted in a GFP expression of 0%. at 50% concentration, disinfectants B and C resulted in 100% GFP expression. microscopy is less sensitive than flow cytometry in detecting fluorescence. percentage of live HEK-293T cells expressing GFP after incubation with adenoviral vector that had undergone 1 min of exposure. exposure to disinfectants A and D led to negligible GFP expression, equivalent to the expression of cells unexposed to virus. hazard ratings for disinfectant B were the lowest, with health, flammability, and reactivity\u2013physical hazard ratings all of 0. all mouse strains had significant aversion to disinfectants A and B. there was no overall effect of strain (P = 0.830) or strain\u2013agent interaction (P = 1.61), indicating that all 3 mice showed the same behavioral pattern. positive value indicates that the mice spent more time on the agent side. negative value indicates that the mice spent more time on the tap-water side. preexposure reduced but did not eliminate aversion to both disinfectants A and B. lentiviral vectors in suspension were effectively eliminated by all tested disinfectants at all contact times. the percentage of HEK-293T cells expressing GFP was negligible and did not vary significantly from the baseline GFP expression of cells unexposed to virus. effect of dilution of disinfectants with FBS on elimination of adenoviral vector in suspension after 1-min contact times. when serum was used to dilute disinfectants to 75% of recommended concentration, significant differences in efficacy were noted. at 75% concentration, exposure to disinfectants A and D resulted in a GFP expression of 0%. adenovirus vector was applied onto cells after 1-min contact times in suspension with disinfectants A through D diluted with FBS to 75%, 50%, or 25% of the recommended concentration. GFP expression increases with decreasing disinfectant concentration. microscopy is less sensitive than flow cytometry in detecting fluorescence. disinfectants A and D continued to result in negligible GFP expression at 5- and 10-min exposure times. there were no significant trends for disinfectants B or C, CCM, or water after 5- and 10-min exposures. value is significantly different from baseline fluorescence of cells unexposed to virus. disinfectant E did not effectively eliminate all virus, yielding an average GFP expression of 90.2% for 1 min of contact. the GFP expression percentage for all contact times with disinfectant E was greater than that of other disinfectants (P 0.0001) but less than that of the water and CCM controls. disinfectants B and C resulted in 100% GFP expression. at 50% concentration, disinfectants B and C resulted in an average of 4% GFP expression, which was equivalent to those of the water and CCM controls. 50% disinfectant D yielded 17% GFP expression. all 4 of the tested disinfectants yielded negligible GFP expression after 1 min of contact at levels as low as 25% of the recommended concentration. Efficacy of disinfectants against adenoviral vectors dried on a nonporous surface. disinfectants A and D resulted in a negligible GFP expression percentage. health, flammability, and reactivity\u2013physical hazard ratings were lowest. all other disinfectants had a health-hazard rating of 2 or 3. all other disinfectants had a health-hazard rating of 2 or 3. data are expressed as means SE; value differs significantly (P 0.001) from that for the water control. preexposure reduced but did not eliminate aversion to both disinfectants A and B. aversion testing indicated that disinfectants A and B caused significant aversion in mice, whereas disinfectants C and D caused no behavioral changes. the use of nonreplicating, GFP-expressing viral vectors as surrogates for equivalent viral diseases has proven to be an effective way to verify and compare the efficacy of various disinfectants. a preliminary assay performed early in the study showed that cell viability was retained after exposure to disinfectants diluted to this degree. the serial dilutions used after the disinfectant contact times were sufficient to arrest the antiviral activity of these disinfectants but maintained the surviving virus at a sufficiently high titer to transduce into cells. however, viral isolation and propagation, which had been required in some previous studies, were unnecessary. quaternary ammonium compounds are considered to be less effective than most oxidant disinfectants. one study found sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and potassium peroxymonosulfate were able to inactivate feline calicivirus, parvovirus, and herpesvirus in suspension. the efficacy results for disinfectant E provided an additional validation of the methodology. disinfectants A and D performed better than disinfectants B and C. they killed 100% of the virus in a little as 1 min of contact time. this result was expected for disinfectant A, given sodium hypochlorite represents the \u2018gold standard\u2019 against which the other products were compared. suspension testing of protein-buffered virus was not performed previously. the maximum burden of FBS to be overcome in dry-surface carrier testing was 5% in the cited study. previous efficacy testing has supported the virucidal activity of liquid formulations of chlorine dioxide,27,107 such as disinfectant C. organic material interferes with disinfectant function through chemical reactions, making pathogens less susceptible to disinfection. the best way to overcome the described physical and chemical barriers is to apply the disinfectant in a manner that ensures appropriate contact. the best way to overcome the described physical and chemical barriers is to apply the disinfectant in a manner that ensure appropriate contact. disinfectants are often sprayed onto a surface and left to act for a period of time before being wiped away. one study found that the way a disinfectant was applied did not have a significant effect as long as the same amount of disinfectant was ultimately present. a human error in disinfectant application or reconstitution may decrease the efficacy of a disinfectant. some products may have a synergistic effect when combined with chemicals that cause neutralizing reactions. water hardness, pH, and temperature all influence disinfectant efficacy. many of the information necessary to assess safety can be found in the SDS. the hazard ratings range from 0, which is negligible, to 4, which is extreme or life threatening. the hazard ratings range from 0, which is negligible, to 4, which is extreme or life threatening. the pH values in the SDS of the tested products indicate that most of them are beyond the recommended range for disposal via the sewage system. dilution in water is not considered an adequate means of achieving compliance with the discharge limitations set forth by the Los Angeles Municipal Code. however, pH might be neutralized by other means, such as buffering. disinfectants A and B were aversive, whereas disinfectants C and D did not have significant effects on behavior. this effect was consistent among all strains and stocks tested, allowing the data for all 3 populations to be pooled. the results are likely representative of the general laboratory mouse population. disinfectant A, a sodium hypochlorite suspension, is considered by many facilities to be the gold standard for disinfection. the disinfectant performed well in efficacy testing, but has considerable health and reactivity hazards and caused aversion in mice. disinfectant D was as effective against viruses and caused less aversion in mice. the present study explored several critical characteristics of surface disinfectants. it validated the need for a comprehensive approach to product assessment. no single disinfectant is best for every purpose."}
