{"summary": "aluminum hydroxide primarily induces a Th2 type antibody response. but for infections such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increasing evidence indicates that there exists a need for adjuvants that can additionally bolster cellular immunity. pIC has been shown to enhance isotype switching and antibody titers. it also appears to effect TLR3-mediated cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. studies have shown that mucosal immunity achieved by natural infection is more effective and protective against viral infection compared to systemic immunity induced by parenteral vaccines. IN administration of dsRNA induces Th1 chemokine production in the lungs and airways. this correlates with increased numbers of non-antigen specific CXCR3+ T lymphocytes that migrate to the lung and airways. the migration of T cells to the respiratory tract occurs in a biphasic manner. ligands CCL3-5 and CCL8 showed a similar pattern of expression in wild-type mice (2-5-fold) after pIC treatment compared to control mice. pIC treatment was incapable of enhancing the production of these chemokines in mice lacking signaling through the type I IFN receptor. -PCR represents relative fold increase in expression of (A) CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 or (B) CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and CCL8 using Gapdh as the endogenous control and wt PBS treated mice as the calibrator. the data are representative from two independent experiments with 3 mice/group. total leukocyte numbers in the airways decreased while there was a resurgence in the frequency and absolute number of T lymphocytes. the first wave of pIC induced T cell recruitment to the airways corresponds with inflammatory leukocyte migration. fraction of the CD4 and CD8 T cells present in the airways on day 1 after pIC administration. by day 5 after pIC treatment central memory T cells waned from the airways. effector memory (CD62LlowCD43low) and effector (CD62LlowCD43high) T cells constituted the majority of the T lymphocytes present in the airways. 3\u20136% airway T cells expressed CCR5 on their surface but CCR5 could be detected intracellularly in approximately 50% of the T cells (Figure S1). these results are in concordance with Kohlmeier et al. [25] and indicate that CCR5 is rapidly internalized following ligand binding. first wave of recruitment (day 0\u20133) occurred both in wild-type and IFNAR/ mice. second wave of T lymphocyte recruitment (day 5\u201312) to the airways was characterized by an increase in both the frequency and number of T lymphocytes but not in the number of mononuclear cells in the airways. a small percentage of CD44hi T cells proliferated and peaked in the MLN of pIC treated mice around days 4\u20135. a small percentage of CD44hi T cells proliferated and peaked in the MLN of pIC treated mice around days 4\u20135. a small but significant fraction of airway T cells had incorporated BrdU in pIC-treated mice compared to PBS controls. despite our observation that 10% of the airway T cells proliferated in response to pIC, our data indicate that de novo T cell proliferation does not substantially contribute to the increase in T cell frequencies. LMW pIC significantly influenced the total number of leukocytes present in the draining LNs by d9 and the total number of BrdU+ and Ki67+ CD3 T cells in the MLN. pIC induced recruitment of leukocytes and proliferation of T lymphocytes in the MLN requires recognition of dsRNA by a combination of dsRNA PRRs. sRNA has been demonstrated to enhance the production of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL11 in serum and in draining lymph nodes [6] Conversely, the Th2-biased adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, is known to inhibit TLR-induced production of CXCL10. pIC treatment failed to induce the expression of CXCL9-11 in IFNAR/ mice. dsRNA induces IFNAR signaling dependent expression of CXCR3 ligands in the lung and airways. total RNA was isolated from whole lung tissue of wt balb/c and IFNAR/ mice following 48 hours of treatment with pIC or PBS (control) the frequency and absolute number of T lymphocytes present in the BALF and lung parenchyma was determined 48 h later. a temporal kinetic analysis of T lymphocytes present in the airways revealed that IN pIC induced two waves of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte recruitment to the airways. however, total leukocyte numbers in the airways decreased while there was a resurgence in the frequency and absolute number of T lymphocytes. b/c mice 2 days after pIC or PBS instillation were harvested at indicated time points. the absolute number of leukocytes (upper panel), the absolute number of T lymphocytes (center panel) and the frequency of T lymphocytes (bottom panel) present in the BAL after IN treatment was determined by FACS analysis. pIC treatment increased frequency and absolute number of CXCR3-expressing T lymphocytes in the airways following IN pIC administration. 3\u20136% airway T cells expressed CCR5 on their surface but CCR5 could be detected intracellularly in approximately 50% of the T cells. the data are representative from two independent experiments with 3 mice/group. the findings indicated that IFNAR signaling affected Th1 chemokine expression in the lung. enchyma and MLN in wild-type mice but not in IFNAR/ mice. pIC induces sustained T lymphocyte recruitment to the airways. downstream products of type I IFN signaling influence T lymphocyte migration. a small percentage of CD44hi T cells proliferated and peaked in the MLN of pIC treated mice around days 4\u20135. despite our observation that 10% of the airway T cells proliferated in response to pIC, our data indicate that de novo T cell proliferation does not substantially contribute to the increase in T cell frequencies and numbers observed in the airways of mice treated IN with pIC. bar graphs depict the number of BrdU+ CD8 T lymphocytes (black bars) relative to the number of BrdU- CD8 T lymphocytes (grey bars) the data are representative from three independent experiments with 3 mice/group. the molecular size of pIC affects T cell recruitment. pIC was loaded on a 1% agarose gel (L, LMW; H, HWM; M, 1 Kb ladder) bar diagrams generated after FACS analysis depict the frequency of lymphocytes in the MLN of mice treated with LMW pIC. the absolute number of proliferating T cells in the MLN on day 9 post IN treatment with LMW pIC was determined by an automated hematology analyzer. IN pIC resulted in two waves of T cell migration to the airways. it was possible that pIC was acting in combination with antigen washed into the airways along with the pIC. pIC induced IFNAR signaling was essential for efficient T cell migration. type I IFN signaling has been shown to influence T cell differentiation, survival and proliferation depending on when and how the T cell is stimulated [35] and to support CD8 clonal expansion and memory formation. pIC is capable of inducing T cell proliferation in the absence of TCR recognition. the defect in IFNAR signaling contributed to poor T cell migration to the airways. both LMW and HMW preparations of pIC were able to stimulate T cell proliferation in the draining lymph nodes. pIC is reported to exclusively act through TLR3 [28]. pIC signals through both cell surface and intracellular dsRNA sensors. pIC signaling through TLR3 appears to beget proliferation of T lymphocytes. pIC induced recruitment of T cells seems to require recognition. male mice (6\u201312 wks of age) were IN administered 50 ug poly (I:C-HMW) in a 50 ul volume under light anesthesia. organs were harvested on the indicated days post treatment. groups of three to six animals were used for each data point. real time PCR Total RNA was isolated from lung tissue of wt and IFNAR/ mice. 2 g of total RNA was reversed transcribed in a 20 l volume. data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. BrdU Administration and Staining Balb/c mice were interperitonally injected with 1.5 mg BrdU on the day of pIC treatment. intracellular staining was achieved using the BD Pharmingen BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) Flow Cytometry analysis single-cell suspensions were obtained from the bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL), lung parenchyma, mediastinal lymph node (MLN) and spleen [42] all animals were maintained in biosafety level 2 (BL2) containment under pathogen-free conditions. unless otherwise indicated, all antibodies listed were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) or Biolegend (San Diego, CA) real time PCR Total RNA was isolated from lung tissue of wt and IFNAR/ mice by homogenizing the tissue in TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) 2 g of total RNA was reversed transcribed in a 20 l volume using Applied Biosystem\u2019s high capacity reverse transcription kit. intracellular staining for BrdU and Ki67 (clone B56) was achieved using the BD Pharmingen BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for two-sample comparison, Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine the significance of differences. absolute numbers of CD44+ T cells expressing CCR5 intracellularly present in the CD3+CD4+ (dark grey bars) and CD3+CD8+ (light grey bars) subpopulations of lymphocytes in the airways. results represent the means of triplicate cultures. the data are representative from two independent experiments with 3 mice/group.
