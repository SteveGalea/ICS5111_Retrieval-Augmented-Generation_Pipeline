{"summary": "this crossover study evaluated 30 healthcare providers from 1 emergency department who performed CC with real-time feedback. the first, second, and third groups started with a cup-type, fold-type, and valve-type respirator. the fit factor values significantly decreased for the cup-type (44.9% 42.8%, P =.003) and valve-type respirators (87.5% 30.3%, P =.012). the protection that is provided by these devices is dependent on the filter's efficiency and seal quality. this is influenced by the shape of the sealing surface, the pressure generated by the tethering devices, the respiratory flow rate, and the wearer's movements. however, even if healthcare providers wear N95 filtering facepiece respirators, there is still a risk of infection related to their movements. the study was performed at the Hanyang University Simulation Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) during August 2016. the local ethics committee approved the study in July 2016. the study's protocol was registered with the Clinical Research Information Service. participants were certified in basic life support by the American Heart Association. quantitative fit test performed using the porta-Count Plus 8038 device. manikin was laid on a backboard (450 600 10 mm, 3 kg Lifeline Plastic; Sung Shim Medical Co., Bucheon, Korea) participants completed questionnaire about their demographic information (age, sex, body weight, and height), experience using N95 filtering facepiece respirators, and experience performing CCs in clinical situations. all participants were prohibited from smoking, eating, chewing gum, and drinking for 30 minutes before starting the quantitative fit test. participants wore the respirators before starting the CCs. the fit factors were measured during 2 minutes of normal breathing. the participants began performing compressions using the manikins on the beds. participants We recruited healthy 20- to 60-year-old healthcare providers from a tertiary medical center during August 2016. we excluded individuals with lung disease (uncontrolled chronic asthma or pneumonia), high blood pressure (systolic pressure of >160 mmHg) and wrist or lower back disease. the cup-type respirator is preformed into a cup shape (3 M 1860) the fold-type respirator is flexible and free-folded (3 M 1870) the valve-type respirator is similar to the fold-type and has a valve for reducing exhalation resistance. participants were prohibited from smoking, eating, chewing gum, and drinking for 30 minutes before starting the quantitative fit test. participants were allowed to practice donning the respirators and to briefly review the department of infection management's instructions regarding wearing the respirators. participants wore the respirators before starting the CCs. they began performing compressions using the manikins on the beds. primary outcome was the adequate protection rate, which was calculated as the proportions of respirators achieving a fit factor of 100. the cup-type and valve-type respirators provided lower adequate protection rates during the CCs than at baseline. the protective performance of the fold-type respirator did not decrease during the chest compressions. the baseline adequate protection rates were significantly different for the 3 respirators (P =.002) the fold-type respirator provided the greatest adequate protection rate (100.0% 0.0%), followed by the valve-type (87.5% 30.3%) and cup-type respirators. respirator preferences Twenty-eight participants (93.3%) preferred the fold-type or valve-type respirators. only 2 participants (6.7%) preferred the cup-type respirator. simulated workplace testing for respirator fit typically considers 8 standard exercises. manual CCs remain the standard of care for the treatment of cardiac arrest. however, manual CCs remain the standard of care for the treatment of cardiac arrest. the physical characteristics of respirators could have different effects on the protective performance during CC. fit testing is needed to confirm whether the respirator is functioning properly during tasks that involve moving the head. this type of testing may help improve safety and protection of healthcare providers in emergency departments."}
