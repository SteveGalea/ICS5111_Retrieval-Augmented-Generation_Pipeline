{"summary": "CM and severe malarial anemia are most serious life-threatening clinical syndromes of Plasmodium falciparum infection in childhood. different host responses to infection are likely to be reflected in plasma proteome-patterns that associate with clinical status. a total of 946 children participated in this study. the current WHO case definitions for severe malaria combine P. falciparum blood stage parasitemia with coma, severe anemia or respiratory distress. the pathogenesis of severe disease is not well understood. previous studies have attempted to define malaria syndromes by studying plasma correlates of severity using reductionist approaches with variable success[12]\u2013[14]. Ibadan has a long 8 months rainy season from March to October with malaria transmission and severe disease present all year round (holoendemic) the study site is located in the UCH Ibadan Department of Paediatrics. malaria-negative children, the controls, are Disease Control (DC) and Community Controls (CC). we followed the WHO criteria for severe P. falciparum malaria [10]. children with hypoglycemia were excluded from the study. the DC group consists of malaria-negative children with infectious diseases such as meningitis, otitis media, diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. the DC group consists of malaria-negative children with infectious diseases such as meningitis, otitis media, diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. plasma was harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 10 minutes), aliquoted and frozen at 80\u00b0C no later than 4 hours following collection. plasma samples were coded, blinded and randomized before application onto the following solid-phase fractionation surfaces. each proteinChip\u00ae 96 well Bioprocessor included 1 quality control plasma standard derived from a single healthy individual, placed at random. mass spectra were generated on a system 4000 Bio-Rad proteinChip\u00ae mass spectrometer. spectrometer calibration was performed using all-in-1 Peptide and Protein calibrants (Bio-Rad) wKIERA combines stochastic-search estimation of distribution algorithm with a kernel pattern-recognition method. we then used discovered relevant subsets of mass clusters to build discriminatory predictive models. we used 10-fold cross validation to select parameters for the SVM. Ibadan has a long 8 months rainy season from March to October. malaria transmission and severe disease present all year round (holoendemic) the study site is located in the UCH Ibadan Department of Paediatrics. we followed the WHO criteria for severe P. falciparum malaria. children with hypoglycemia were excluded from the study. CM patients recover consciousness after effective antimalarial therapy. all clinical groups PCV significantly different to CC (p0.05). the DC group consists of malaria-negative children with infectious diseases such as meningitis, otitis media, diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. plasma was harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 10 minutes), aliquoted and frozen at 80\u00b0C no later than 4 hours following collection. plasma samples were coded, blinded and randomized before application onto the following solid-phase fractionation surfaces (ProteinChip\u00ae arrays Bio-Rad) each proteinChip\u00ae 96 well Bioprocessor included 1 quality control plasma standard derived from a single healthy individual, placed at random. mass spectra were generated on a system 4000 Bio-Rad ProteinChip\u00ae mass spectrometer. spectral peaks corresponding to mass/charge (m/z) clusters were detected and clustered using proteinChip\u00ae datamanager client 4.1 software (BioRad) we used 10-fold cross validation to select parameters for the SVM. for the final model parameters, we selected those that gave the overall highest accuracy across the whole 10-fold cross validation. to obtain robust accuracy estimates, we took 100 random re-samplings of the data. children with either CM, SMA or UM, and 130 malaria-negative DC or CC children are presented in Table 1. both discovery and validation SMA groups had PCVs below 16%. CM, UM and CC groups had mild anemia in both cohorts. CC had normal mean hematocrit (Table 1). blue bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with non-parasitemic CC. orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). the best predictive model for each group comparison in the discovery cohort was asked to predict the group class in the validation cohort. we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive models for both discovery and validation cohort groups in ROC space. CM and SMA groups showed overlap at the cluster interface and clearer segregation at the periphery. in comparison of both severe forms (CM and SMA) with UM we observed that the severe patients had compact center clusters surrounded by a more disperse cluster of the UM patient group. each sphere represents an individual child proteome profile plotted in 3D space defined by the first three principal components. CM vs. UM and (f.) SMA vs. UM. f1 to f6 represent anionic plasma fractions at pH 9.0 (f1), pH 7.0 (f2), pH 5.0 (f3), pH 4.0 (f4), pH 3.0 (f5) and organic phase. CM, CM, SMA (malaria-positive) and DC (malaria-negative) ill children from the malaria-negative well children CC. each plasma fraction (f1 to f6) contains a set of proteins that clearly define both the malaria-positive and malaria-negative ill children to those malaria-negative well children. 160 malaria-positive children with either CM, SMA or UM, and 130 malaria-negative DC or CC children are presented in Table 1. both discovery and validation groups had PCVs below 16% (Table 1). Parasite densities across all the infected groups were similar (Table 1). blue bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with non-parasitemic CC. orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). orange bars compare (CM, SMA and UM) with DC (non-parasitemic). the best predictive model for each group comparison was asked to predict the group class in the validation cohort. we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive models for both discovery and validation cohort groups in ROC space and found them to be similar. CM and SMA groups showed overlap at the cluster interface and clearer segregation at the periphery. we then compared the severe forms (CM and SMA) with UM. each sphere represents an individual child proteome profile plotted in 3D space defined by the first three principal components. CM vs. UM and (f.) SMA vs. UM. f1 to f6 represent anionic plasma fractions at pH 9.0 (f1), pH 7.0 (f2), pH 5.0 (f3), pH 4.0 (f4), pH 3.0 (f5) and organic phase. CM, CM, SMA (malaria-positive) and DC (malaria-negative) ill children from the malaria-negative well children CC. each plasma fraction (f1 to f6) contains a set of proteins that clearly define both the malaria-positive and malaria-negative ill children to those malaria-negative well children. the plasma proteome differences are specific for the malaria disease process and not surrogate markers of acute illness. we have also discovered plasma proteome differences that are specific to each of the childhood malaria syndromes assessed in the present study. our findings provide a starting point to refine the current WHO definitions of these syndromes. proteome profiling has been used to define a variety of disease states[16], [19]\u2013[24]. complex plasma protein patterns were necessary to discriminate between the different malaria syndromes. this further underlines the advantage of using unbiased high-throughput pattern recognition based methods."}
