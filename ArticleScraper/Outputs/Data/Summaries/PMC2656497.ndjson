{"summary": "the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is used to amplify GMO-specific DNA sequences. results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible. dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP. s used contain, at their 5' end, a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site. displacement primers help the formation of these hairpins at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed, these structures can be copied into a series of DNA fragments containing multiple units of the target sequence. insertions of the transgenes have different breakpoints from the plasmids. it was possible to design assays for the RF3 and MS8 events using a common set of primers within the transgenes. specificity of the two assays was tested using plasmid DNA for each event. copy number detection was measured by serial dilutions of known amounts of DNA containing the target sequences, either as genomic or plasmid DNA. a. Sensitivity of LAMP using genomic target. analyses of these products show that they are formed by interactions of the primers used [8], to form LAMP equivalents of primer-dimers. in the absence of target, low background DNA may aid the formation of non-specific products that go on to be amplified. freeze-thaw repetitions may induce damage to the primers to permit the formation of 'primer intermediates' ten roundUp ReadyTM GMO targets were detected in a background of 100 ng of genomic oilseed rape DNA. this background DNA represents a GMO level of 0.01% for both T-nos and P-35S assays. the use of 100 ng of this sample would be equivalent to adding 200 copies of the transgene sequence, considerably more than the experimental input of 10 copies. sensitivity and reliability of the LAMP method for GMO detection. the technique relies on the design of inter-related primers. orientation and positions are important for self-priming through stem-looped products. the plant sequences are those shown in Table 1. dark blue bases highlighted are the outer displacement primers. yellow and green sequences are the 5' and 3' ends of the LAMP primers respectively. serial dilutions of the plasmid pGreenII were amplified using primers for the Pnos target. numbers represent the calculated copy numbers of the plasmid derived from the DNA value. LAMP of samples containing 10 copies of RoundUp ReadyTM soya transgene (S) and in a background of 100 ng of oilseed rape DNA (O) was tested using assays for commonly-used sequence motifs, the CaMV 35S promoter (P-35S) and the Agrobacterium promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene. we have found that denaturation of template was a pre-requisite step prior to amplification. this can be explained by the fact that we do not use a base pair destabiliser, such as betaine, in the reaction buffer. the consistent amplification within all dilutions showed that LAMP is an 'all or nothing' reaction, with little of the tailing off effect that is often observed in PCRs with diluting templates. this makes it easy to identify positive reactions. the sample was emulsified with 5 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 TE (100 mM Tris:Cl, 10 mM EDTA pH 8) and purified using Qiagen DNeasy kit to a final volume of 200 L of 0.1 TE (1 mM Tris 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8). DNA containing RoundUp ReadyTM soya was extracted from soya Roundup ReadyTM GMO Reference Material (Fluka Biochemika, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) the plasmid pGreenII 0049 was a gift from Mark Smedley and Wendy Harwood of the John Innes Centre.
