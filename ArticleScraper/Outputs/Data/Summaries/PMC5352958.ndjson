{"summary": "METHODS In 2014, surveillance was conducted in two phases among Australian Hajj pilgrims. 26 (14.2%) tested positive for S. pneumoniae; 4 had received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. pharyngeal colonisation of pathogens may contribute to serious bacterial infections, including pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. localised meningococcal outbreaks have been linked to international travel, migration, attendance at Hajj and participation in sporting events. a 20.9% carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was found. of these 1.5% were methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [22]. in another study in four Makkah hospitals, MRSA accounted for 199 of 512 (39%) S. aureus clinical isolates. nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected on the fifth day of their stay in tents. in a subset of pilgrims who had respiratory symptoms, swabs were also collected on the first day of recruitment. the swabs were transported approximately 5 km on ice to the collaborating laboratory in Makkah. Bacterial colonies growing following 24-48 h of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C were identified using the Bruker Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, United States) matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) NAT of N. meningitidis was detected using a previously described assay[34], that uses a single amplification real-time PCR targeting a 110 base-pair segment of the meningococcal capsular transfer gene, ctrA. the reaction mix was amplified at 95 \u00b0C 15 min (96 \u00b0C 10 s; 63 \u00b0C 1 min) for 45 cycles. idis serogroup Samples where N. meningitidis was detected were further evaluated using a previously described molecular serotyping method[35]. samples were tested using five single-plex conventional assays targeting different regions of the orf-2 and siaD genes which are specific for serotypes A, B, C, W and Y. nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from pilgrims in their tents. the swabs were transported approximately 5 km on ice to the collaborating laboratory in Makkah. the swabs were transported approximately 5 km on ice to the collaborating laboratory in Makkah. abs collected during the second phase were directly plated onto mannitol aztreonam methicillin salt, chocolate and nalidixic acid (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) and modified New York City (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, United States) agar plates were identified using the Bruker Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, United States) matrix-assisted NAT of N. meningitidis was detected using a previously described assay[34] that uses a single amplification real-time PCR targeting a 110 base-pair segment of the meningococcal capsular transfer gene, ctrA. NAT of N. meningitidis serogroup Samples where N. meningitidis was detected were further evaluated using a previously described molecular serotyping method[35]. samples were tested using five single-plex conventional assays targeting different regions of the orf-2 and siaD genes which are specific for serotypes A, B, C, W and Y. a total of 246 pilgrims were recruited to this study. median age for pilgrims was 40 years (range 12-67), 126 (51.2%) were women. median age for pilgrims was 40 years (range 12-67), 126 (51.2%) were women. thirty-eight (20.8%) participants had a confirmed history of receiving 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine within six months prior to travel. only one (0.6%) tested positive for N. meningitidis (serogroup W). seventy-six (41.5%) participants reported using a facemask. 92 (50.3%) reported not using a facemask at anytime during Hajj. the pneumococcal carriage rate was similar in those who used a facemask. of the 93 participants in this group, 38 (40.9%) reported receiving pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13 in all. thirty-two (34.4%) reported using a facemask, 59 (63.4%) reported not using a facemask. of 59 pilgrims who did not use a facemask, S. aureus was isolated from 9 (15%) (P = 0.27) twenty-six (14.2%) participants had a confirmed history of receiving 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) within six months prior to travel. only one (0.6%) tested positive for N. meningitidis (serogroup W) 89 (95.7%) reported receiving the quadrivalent meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine before travelling to hajj. four (4.3%) did not recall their vaccination history but had attended Hajj before. a 14.2% pneumococcal carriage rate in pilgrims during the Hajj 2014 is moderately high. about 2 in 5 received conjugate pneumococcal vaccine before travel. the prevalence of PCV13 vaccine-serotypes was only 1.1%. the carriage rates reported in all studies including ours were much lower than the high carriage rate of 62% found by Benkouiten et al[39] among french pilgrims during the Hajj 2013. high PCV13 uptake (39%) in the post-Hajj cohort may have reduced the carriage rate or it could be an effect of antibiotic use (17.2% reported receiving antibiotics while at Hajj) pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine uptake among australian pilgrims ranged between 14% and 29%[41-43]. a study conducted in mina during Hajj 2003 among 344 pilgrims from 29 different nations identified a carriage rate of 3.2%[44], following the 2000-2001 W epidemic. 20 percent of the pilgrims reported receiving antibiotics for respiratory illnesses during Hajj[8]. this high rate of antibiotic use compares with 17.2% reported by participants in our study. in 2010, 27% of returned Turkish Hajj pilgrims were positive for meningococcal carriage. transnational dissemination of multi-drug resistant organisms has been reported[52] in the context of pneumococcal disease. about 20% of the pneumococcal isolates at Hajj are penicillin resistant. antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical specimens for meningococci and pneumococci is important[52]. we found an 18% carriage rate of S. aureus in the second phase of the study, but did not detect MRSA. this compares with a nasal carriage rate of 25% among arriving international pilgrims and 20.9% among departing pilgrims during the Hajj 2009[58] this is the first Australian carriage surveillance study for potentially pathogenic bacteria such as pneumococci, meningococci and S. aureus among Hajj pilgrims. the discordance in the number of participants between first and second phase was due to unavailability of some participants for post-Hajj sampling within 2 mo after Hajj. this study found a moderately high carriage rate of S. pneumoniae amongst pilgrims during the Hajj 2014. applications This pilot study demonstrates that a larger study is feasible and important to inform public health measures to prevent the transmission and limit the impact of significant infectious diseases. further information on the serotype of circulating pneumococcal isolates will optimise the use of pneumococcal vaccination in pilgrims. pneumococcal isolates will optimise the use of pneumococcal vaccination in pilgrims. circulating pneumococcal isolates will optimise the use of pneumococcal vaccination."}
