{"summary": "researchers are beginning to explore mathematical models that incorporate such actions. these models have been used to inform strategies to control the spread of disease. a number of models have linked media communication about a disease to protective action. model is an extension of our previous model, ALARM [14], which attempted to quantify the level of social reaction to disease. but the model did not take the role of media into account in the disease transmission process. the model is based on the case of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) transmission in Mexico City. the observed media coverage of the outbreak differs substantially from what would be predicted by approximate media functions. in the model, we explicitly quantify media influence, which leads to a reduction in per-contact probability of disease transmission. if vaccine is available, we implement an imperfect vaccine, with a delay of d time units before becoming effective. for influenza, the delay before full immunity is approximately two weeks [18]. it has been shown that formulating imperfect vaccination as an all-or-nothing effect equal to the vaccine efficacy correctly estimates the direct effectiveness of the vaccine. the media function, g, decreases as the exponentially-weighted moving average of the number of news articles increases. we used the exponentially-weighted moving average of the number of news articles, assuming that articles published in the recent past would continue to have bearing on current behavior. simulations were conducted on a network of 500,000 individuals (scale-free network with mean degree of 4), with 10 initially infected individuals. for baseline per-contact infection probability, p0 = 0.35, and time to recovery, TR = 1. one week was used as the value of TR, since influenza cases typically recover within a week. to model Mexico City we used a scale-free network [28] with mean degree 2k and 885,108 nodes [29], each representing 10 people. the quality of fit was determined by mean absolute error (MAE) between the observed total number of cases and the median number of simulated cases per week taken over 1000 replications. the best estimate of seroprevalence comes from a study conducted in Monterrey, Mexico. the best estimate of seroprevalence comes from a study conducted in Monterrey, Mexico. the 2014-2015 influenza vaccine had low effectiveness, only 18%. coverage of the outbreak was limited. the number of news articles per week peaked at the height of the influenza season. if X t - 1 i = S and X t i = I, then: X t i = = X t + T R - 1 i = I and X t + T R i = R. when vaccine is available, we implement an imperfect vaccine, with a delay of d time units before becoming effective. the delay before full immunity is approximately two weeks [18]. we used the exponentially-weighted moving average of the number of news articles. assuming articles published in the past would continue to have bearing on current behavior. but the level of influence would decrease with time. if vaccine is available, we implement imperfect vaccine with a delay of d time units before becoming effective. for influenza, the delay before full immunity is approximately two weeks. if susceptible individual, i, is vaccinated at time t: X t + d j = R with probability S with probability 1 -. the number of news articles increases, meaning that transmission is most slowed when there have been many articles published about the disease in the recent past. we used the exponentially-weighted moving average of the number of news articles, assuming that articles published in the recent past would continue to have bearing on current behavior but that the level of influence would decrease with time. simulations were conducted on a network of 500,000 individuals (scale-free network with mean degree of 4), with 10 initially infected individuals. for baseline per-contact infection probability, p0 = 0.35, and time to recovery, TR = 1, we simulated outbreaks varying the media parameters. to model Mexico City we used a scale-free network [28] with mean degree 2k and 885,108 nodes [29], each representing 10 people. the quality of fit was determined by mean absolute error (MAE) between the observed total number of cases and the median number of simulated cases per week taken over 1000 replications of the model. the value of p0 and TR does not affect the interpretation of the roles of and. simulations were conducted on a network of 500,000 individuals (scale-free network with mean degree of 4), with 10 initially infected individuals. the quality of fit was determined by mean absolute error (MAE) between the observed total number of cases and the median number of simulated cases per week taken over 1000 replications of the model. the spring and fall outbreaks were weighted equally. the best estimate of seroprevalence comes from a study conducted in Monterrey, Mexico. we assumed that the disease prevalence in Mexico City was also 33%, and scaled the confirmed cases appropriately. the spring outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City attracted intense media interest. the best estimate of seroprevalence comes from a study conducted in Monterrey, Mexico. we assumed that the disease prevalence in Mexico City was also 33%. we assumed that the disease prevalence in Mexico City was also 33%. the 2014-2015 influenza vaccine had low effectiveness, only 18%. the number of vaccinations per week peaked at the height of the influenza season. high values of can produce two wave outbreaks, if the value of is high enough to dramatically slow transmission but not high enough to altogether stop transmission for long enough for the outbreak to die out. as increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission. most common media function from the literature takes the form: f ( I, d I d t, a, b ) = e - max 0, a I + b d I d t. proposed media function, g, based on number of published news articles is compared with the media function, f, based on the number of infected individuals and the change in the number of infected individuals. the proposed media function accurately captures both the large reduction in the spread of disease during the spring outbreak, due to social distancing, and the insignificant reduction during the fall outbreak. use of actual media data fills the void, allowing us to account for the heightened attention to the disease in the spring that led to the extreme social distancing that eventually curtailed the outbreak. the best-fit parameters achieved an excellent fit to the observed cases. the median number of cases was not substantially different than the median number in simulations conducted assuming no media coverage. media exposure causes individuals to implement protective behaviors, reducing the per-contact transmission probability. high values of can produce two wave outbreaks, if the value of is high enough to dramatically slow transmission but not high enough to altogether stop transmission for long enough for the outbreak to die out. as increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission. During the spring outbreak, the average reduction was 62.4%. During the fall outbreak, the average reduction was 17.0%. the best-fit parameters for Mexico City 2009 A(H1N1). Fig 3C compares the best-fit curve obtained using the proposed media function with the best-fit curve obtained using the media function f. the proposed media function, g, is compared with the media function, f, based on the number of published news articles. the proposed media function accurately captures both the large reduction in the spread of disease during the spring outbreak, due to social distancing, and the insignificant reduction during the fall outbreak. the model overestimates the peak by over twice as much during the spring outbreak. the model relies on volume of news coverage to estimate the media signal. the proposed model relies on volume of news coverage to estimate the media signal. During the spring outbreak, the average reduction was 62.4%. During the fall outbreak, the average reduction was 17.0%. the best-fit parameters for Mexico City 2009 A(H1N1).
