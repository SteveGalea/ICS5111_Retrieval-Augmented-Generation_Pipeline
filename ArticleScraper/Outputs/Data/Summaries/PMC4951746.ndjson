{"summary": "in outbreaks of infectious disease, healthcare personnel are at increased risk of contracting emerging infections in the process of patient care. the rate of HCP-related infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus, Ebola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus has been reported to be around 1% to 27%. the literature on infection control practices for HCP appears to focus mostly on healthcare professionals other than students. in the early summer of 2015, middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) struck south Korea, and 36 (19.35%) died of the disease. students pursue clerkships in specific clinical disciplines of interest at the SMC. on average, 40 students are enrolled in each academic year. mainly students in Year 4, 5 and 6 were exposed to risk of contracting MERS. the first Korean patient with MERS was reported at the SMC. several nearby patients were subsequently identified as having MERS. one doctor also acquired the disease from the index patient. the emergency committee was convened to develop a response. the school was partially closed and stopped admitting outpatients. an increasing number of faculty members were suspected to have contacted patients with MERS and were isolated at home. the school was concerned with transmission of the disease in the hospital even after students returned from the break. a tertiary hospital has 33 clinical divisions and five speciality centers. students perform clinical clerkships at KSH in Year 6 for further training in specific disciplines of interest. the school assisted faculty members at KSH with curriculum/program design. guidelines for avoiding student infection. 125 students developed an infection. the school successfully executed the two scheduled tutorials. but there are a few things that could have been better. students cannot be expected to share the same risks and duties as professional health care workers. it behooves medical schools and hospitals to ensure student protection from a contagion. decision-making process needs to be rational and flexible. a number of web-based tools available for distance learning ranging from freeware to virtual classroom tools. the use of such tools can substantially reduce the possibility of cross-infection while continuing education for medical students during outbreaks of infectious disease. medical schools may consider offering web-based courses in similar outbreaks that prohibit face-to-face meeting of individuals. medical schools can acquire adequate cooperation of the hospitals with rapid curriculum changes in an emergency situation. proper communication with individual faculty, students, and parents is necessary since they are directly affected by changes in the curriculum. the rationale of decisions needs to be detailed so that key players are aware of the school\u2019s actions against an infection outbreak. the emergency committee was convened to develop a response. the committee acknowledged a high risk of infection exposure to MERS. the clerkships were halted, lecture classes continued unless instructors were suspected to have MERS. an increasing number of faculty members were suspected to have contacted patients with MERS and were isolated at home. the school was concerned with transmission of the disease in the hospital even after students returned from the break. a limited number of patients were hospitalized due to the partial closure of the hospital. the emergency committee directly contacted KSH executives and openly discussed the circumstances that the school was confronting. the school assisted faculty members at KSH with curriculum/program design. the school provided sample rubrics for student evaluation during the clerkships. the emergency committee was convened to develop a response. the committee acknowledged a high risk of infection exposure to MERS. the clerkships were halted and lecture classes continued. an increasing number of faculty members were suspected to have contacted patients with MERS and were isolated at home. the school leadership admitted an imperative need to completely restrict student access to the hospital, which amounted to closure. the emergency committee declared the school closure period (4 weeks) to be the summer break. the emergency committee directly contacted KSH executives and openly discussed the circumstances that the school was confronting. the school assisted faculty members at KSH with curriculum/program design. the school also provided sample rubrics for student evaluation during the clerkships. a number of suggestions for medical schools to consider in case of outbreaks of highly infectious agents such as MERS. a cessation of clinical clerkships to restrict student access to the index hospital was one of the early interventions of the local medical schools to protect their students [7,8]. students cannot be expected to share the same risks and duties as professional health care workers. school administration might consider closing the school in order to ensure student safety. the decision-making process needs to be rational and flexible. the use of such tools can substantially reduce the possibility of cross-infection while continuing education for medical students during outbreaks of infectious disease. medical schools may consider preparing web-based courses in similar outbreaks that prohibit face-to-face meetings of individuals. the dean of sKKUSOM regularly emailed faculty, students, and parents to share details of the school\u2019s reactions to the evolving situation during the MERS outbreak. the dean of sKKUSOM regularly emailed faculty, students, and parents to share details of the school\u2019s reactions to the evolving situation during the outbreak. medical students should confront the realities of professional life and gain experience with infection control measures including the use of personal protective equipment. students cannot be expected to share the same risks and duties as professional health care workers. it behooves medical schools and hospitals to ensure student protection from a contagion. a number of web-based tools are available for distance learning. the use of such tools can substantially reduce the possibility of cross-infection while continuing education for medical students during outbreaks of infectious disease. medical schools may consider preparing to offer web-based courses in similar outbreaks. medical schools have more than one affiliated hospital where students take clerkships. they are responsible for monitoring the clerkship schedules at each hospital and maintaining contact with hospital personnel in charge of student education. the dean of SKKUSOM regularly emailed faculty, students, and parents to share details of the school\u2019s reactions to the evolving situation during the MERS outbreak. the decision to suspend all educational activities should be carefully made, taking into account the need to balance appropriate precautions against the disruption to normal activities. the school can opt to continue nonclinical teaching through the use of information technology through the use of web-based synchronous technology."}
