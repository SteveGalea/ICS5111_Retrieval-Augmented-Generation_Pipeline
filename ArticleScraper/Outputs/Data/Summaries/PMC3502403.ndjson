{"summary": "astroviruses form a family of small, non-enveloped, positive strand RNA viruses that infect many animals. first identified in human stool samples in 1975, these viruses were named after their star-shaped appearance in some electron micrographs. astroviruses have been shown to replicate in cells of the intestinal tracts of infected organisms. a domestic rabbit colony of about 100 animals experienced an outbreak of enterocolitis near Johnson City, TN, USA. the predominant rabbit breeds were angora, satin and mini rex. no changes in diet had occurred in 1.5 years. 4 of 5 small intestinal cultures grew E. coli that was found not to be an attaching effacing effacing E. coli. electron microscopy observed 30 nm virus-like particles in the stool of 1 of 2 animals tested. initial attempts to isolate virus from 2 samples in tissue culture were unsuccessful. virus-like particles were observed but diagnostic testing failed to identify known viruses. several samples were subjected to Virochip analysis. total nucleic acid was extracted from the stool of four sick animals and one unaffected control. additional degenerate primers and 3\u2032 RACE were used to recover a 5 kbp contiguous sequence. but repeated attempts using 5\u2032 RACE and other PCR-based strategies failed to recover the full predicted 7 kb genome. the average Sanger quality score of these sequences was 19.5 at base 1, 17.3 at base 100, and 14.4 at base 150. the average Sanger quality score of these sequences was 19.5 at base 1, 17.3 at base 100, and 14.4 at base 150. deletions occurred at a frequency of 1.3% (1.3 indels per 100 bases aligned), more frequent than mismatches, which occurred at a frequency of 0.28%. 1.9105 unique sequences (6% of sequences) derived from the astrovirus, corresponding to >1000x average coverage of its genome. mmalian cell lines previously shown to support the replication of human astroviruses: Vero, HT-29, and Caco-2. culture supernatants were collected on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 post innoculation. rabbit astrovirus RNA was detected in the day 1 supernatant (in the innoculum) Phylogeny based on the first 420 amino acids of the indicated ORF2 (capsid) sequences. RT-PCR using these primers indicated that only the EM-positive sick rabbit tested positive for the virus. nm virus-like particles were observed in the stool of 1 of 2 animals tested.
