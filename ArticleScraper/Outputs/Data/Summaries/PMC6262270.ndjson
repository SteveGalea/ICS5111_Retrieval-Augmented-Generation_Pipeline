{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces rearrangements of the host cell membranes known as the membranous web. these membrane alterations are thought to create a platform bringing together the replicase proteins, virus genomes, and host proteins required for replication. these membrane alterations are thought to create a platform bringing together the replicase proteins, virus genomes, and host proteins required for replication. biochemical analyses of purified DMVs have shown these vesicles contain an enzymatically active viral replicase capable of catalyzing de novo HCV RNA synthesis. replication complexes may cease to be active after the sealing of the DMV membranes [5] the rare investigations performed on liver biopsy specimens from HCV-infected patients have not addressed the question of the membranous web. ultrathin sections were cut, stained with 5% uranyl acetate 5% lead citrate. sections were placed on electron microscopy grids coated with collodion. for each biopsy specimen, at least 5 consecutive squares of the TEM grid (5000 m2) were observed, representing several hundred hepatocytes. the area indicated by the white arrow in panel A contains a vesicle cluster characteristic of HCV-infected livers. this high magnification clearly shows the presence of vesicles composed of a single membrane that cannot be confused with two tightly apposed membranes. the area indicated by the white arrow in panel A contains normal ER. dsRNA-triggered antiviral responses have been reported in such cells [5,12]. the concealment of viral RNA in DMVs may be part of the immune response mechanisms of the host cell itself, particularly in cell lines cultured in vitro. dsRNA-triggered antiviral responses may be part of the innate immune response mechanisms. a structure similar to that observed here was reported in the liver biopsy specimens from HCV-infected chimpanzees used for the initial description of the membranous web. this study provides the first description of the membranous web established by HCV in human liver."}
