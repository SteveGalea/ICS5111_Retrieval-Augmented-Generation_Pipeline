{"summary": "guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and CpG ODNs are a promising new type of therapeutic agent for malignant tumors. both guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and CpG ODNs are a promising new type of therapeutic agent for malignant tumors. a contiguous 4-guanosine sequence in c-myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc) antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides could inhibit the growth of human lung cancer cells. however, there are still no detailed data on the effect of the inclusion of the CpG motif on the anti-adhesive potential of GRO. poly-guanosine (polyG) and CpG motifs can inhibit tumor cell adhesion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. all ODNs were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.0) buffer. B16 cells (4104 per well) were co-cultured with ODN at 6g/mL for 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C. nonadherent cells were slightly washed away with PBS. the number of adherent cells in four replicate wells was counted. unpaired 2-tailed Student's t-test was applied to analyze the data. the experiments were carried out using 6- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Vital River) well culture plate was coated by a mixture containing FN at 10 g/mL and BW001 at 6 g/mL and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. after incubation, the plate was treated in the same way as mentioned above. cell adhesion to endothelial cells A total of 4104 HUVECs in 100 L IMDM were seeded in the 96-well plate. dherent cells were slightly washed away, and then sections were fixed with 4% polyoxymethylene, and covered with 20% glycerol. the number of adherent cells was counted under fluorescence microscopy. in the i.p. model, the mice (n=4\u20135) were inoculated with tumor cells and sacrificed 7 days later. the number of colonies was counted in the peritoneal cavity of each mouse. 10 mice in each group were monitored for 30 days after tumor challenge. fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and penicillin\u2013streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and penicillin\u2013streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen) in an incubator (Heraeus) with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the sequences in box were phosphodiester linkage, and the sequences outside the box were phosphorothioate linkage. the influence of polyG tail. (polyA) BW001, (polyC) BW001, and (polyT) BW001 were the forms that replaced the ployG tail. in vitro assay Cell adhesion in culture plate A total of 4104 cells per well was seeded in a 96-well plate and co-cultured with ODN at 6 g/mL or equal volume of PBS at 37\u00b0C incubator. the average number of four replicate wells was used for each sample. a total of 4104 cells per well in 100 L of IMDM were seeded in a 96-well plate containing 10% FBS. then 4104 tumor cell suspensions containing 6 g/mL ODN were added into the HUVEC monolayer. the plate was treated in the same way as mentioned above. fibronectin (FN) at 10 g/mL and BW001 at 6 g/mL washed by PBS three times. suspensions of 4104 B16 cells were added in each well. plate was treated in the same way as mentioned above. the number of adherent cells was counted under fluorescence microscopy. the cell suspension was fixed with 75% pre-cooled alcohol and stained with propidium iodide (PI) and then the PI-labeled cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. p. model, the mice (n=4\u20135) were inoculated with tumor cells and sacrificed 7 days later. the number of colonies was counted in the peritoneal cavity of each mouse. 10 mice in each group were monitored for 30 days after tumor challenge. self-designed CpG ODN BW001 decreased adherent numbers of B16 cells to a plastic plate. well-known CpG ODNs (CpG 2216, 2006, and C274) did not affect adhesion of the B16 cells (p>0.05 vs. PBS) the cells treated with BW001 clumped together compared with the spreading state of the cells in the 2216-, 2006- and C274-treated wells. tailed Student's t-test was applied to analyze the data. tailed Student's t-test was applied to analyze the data. polyG motif at the 3\u2032 end of BW001 was replaced with polyA, polyC, or polyT. the polyG motif failed to inhibit the adhesion of B16 cells (p>0.05 vs. PBS) however, there was no influence on the anti-adhesive activity of the BW001. 16 cells displayed decreased adhesion ability on a plate coated by FN or type 1 collagen. we therefore used FN and collagen type 1 to mimic the ECM. we found that the number of adherent B16 cells was less in the BW001 wells than in the PBS wells. g/mL with BW001 at 6 g/mL and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. nonadherent cells were slightly washed away with PBS. the average number of adherent cells in four replicate wells was counted. a total of 4104 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in 100 L Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium were seeded in the 96-well plate and cultured overnight to form a confluent monolayer (A), then 4104 BEL-7402 cell (B) or B16 cell (C) suspensions containing ODN at 6 g/mL were added into the HUVEC monolayer and co-cultured the number of melanoma colonies decreased in the peritoneal cavity. the survival time of tumor-bearing mice was prolonged by BW001 treatment. female C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 3.5105 B16 cell suspensions containing indicated ODN (25 g per mouse) or PBS. all mice were sacrificed 7 days later. female C57BL/6 mice (n=8\u201310) were intraperitoneally inoculated with B16 cells (3.5105/mouse) suspensions containing indicated ODNs (25 g per mouse) female C57BL/6 mice (n=6\u201310) were intraperitoneally inoculated with BW001 1 hour earlier before tumor challenge. co-administration of 3.5105 B16 cells and BW001 was used as control group. we found that tumor growth was arrested and tumor size was smaller in the BW001 group than in the PBS group. however, there was no difference between that of other ODN groups and the PBS group (p>0.05). the data suggest that BW001 can delay the growth of melanoma in vivo. the number of melanoma colonies in the BW001 group was the lowest (p0.001 vs. all others) the number of melanoma colonies in the other ODN groups was not different from the number in the PBS group (p>0.05). however, we found that there were no differences in colony numbers between the BW001 group and the other groups when BW001 was injected 1 hour before tumor challenge (p>0.05) BW001-treated melanoma cells showed decreased adhesion, spreading, and proliferation ability. a self-designed CpG ODN BW001 decreased the adherent numbers of B16 cells to a plastic plate. well-known CpG ODNs (CpG 2216, 2006, and C274) did not affect the adhesion of the B16 cells (p>0.05 vs. PBS) oligodeoxynucleotides were co-cultured at 6 g/mL for 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C. the number of adherent cells in four replicate wells was counted. unpaired 2-tailed Student's t-test was applied to analyze the data. guanine-cytosine (GC)-reversed form of BW001 had an effect similar to that of BW001 (p>0.05) but partPSBW001 or NStailBW001, representing the form of only the polyG tail to be phosphorothioated or the backbone to be phosphorothioated of BW001, could not inhibit the adhesion of B16 cells. the data show that the B16 cell adhesion-inhibiting activity of BW001 depends on the existence of a full-PS backbone and more than four contiguous guanosines. we therefore used FN and collagen type 1 to mimic the ECM and observe the influence of BW001 on the adhesion of B16 cells to the ECM. 96-well culture plate was coated with FN at 10 g/mL (A) or type 1 collagen at 18.25 g/mL (D) with BW001 at 6 g/mL. suspensions of 4104 B16 cells were added in each well and co-cultured. in both the BW001 and BW002 groups were less than in the PBS group. however, there were no differences between partPSBW001 or BW001-6 and the PBS group (p>0.05 vs. PBS). this indicated that a BW001-like structure can inhibit the adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells. fewer adherent cells in the BW001 group than in the PBS group. the influence of BW001 on adhesion of melanoma cells to lung tissue was shown in Fig. 5. the number of melanoma colonies in the peritoneal cavity decreased in the peritoneal cavity. colonies in the BW001 group were the least (p=0.007 vs. PBS; p=0.016 vs. BW002), followed by the number of colonies in the BW002 group (p=0.032 vs. PBS) a BW001-like structure can decrease melanoma colony formation in the mouse peritoneal cavity. melanoma-bearing mice in the BW001 group were the longest (p0.05 vs. all others), followed by the survival rates of the partPSBW001 and BW001-6 groups (p0.05 vs. PBS) there were no differences in the survival times of the mice among the polyG20, BW002 and PBS groups. this ability depends on the existence of the CpG motif and can be enhanced by the appearance of the polyG motif. the growth of subcutaneous melanoma was delayed by BW001 treatment. the mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 3.5105 B16 cells suspensions containing ODN (25 g per mouse) the tumors were measured every 2 days beginning with the appearance of palpable nodes. the number of melanoma colonies in the BW001 group was the lowest (p0.001 vs. all others) the number of melanoma colonies in the other ODN groups was not different from the number in the PBS group (p>0.05). however, we found that 8 of 10 mice immediately died in the BW002 control group after injection of the mixture of B16 cells and the ODN. co-administration of tumor cell and ODN was used as control group. co-administration of tumor cell and ODN was used as control group. melanoma colony numbers on lung surface were counted. macrophages are abundant in the peritoneal cavity. CpG ODN can recognize TLR9 expressed in macrophages. it stimulates tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages. in our study, we found that when BW001 was separately injected, it did not induce a metastasis-inhibiting effect similar to that of the BW001-B16 cells co-administered group. this suggests the possibility that contact of BW001 with melanoma cells may block the binding of melanoma cells with the metastasizing organ. the tumor-inhibiting effect of BW001 may partially benefit from the other antitumor properties of we repeated the procedures three times, and found a similar phenomenon in which the mice immediately expired with co-administration of B16 cells and BW002. however, there was no such incident in the BW001 group. therefore, it is possible that BW002 may more easily form intramolecular duplexes by itself or exist intermolecular interaction between BW002 and the surface molecular on B16 cells. this provides a new direction for further research. interests exist."}
