{"summary": "core competencies for global health education among PCCM trainees have not been formalized. a framework can be derived from national and international bodies of global health education as well as from the experience of numerous academic institutions in implementing global health educational programs. integrating global health tracks aim to teach core competencies in global health over the course of PCCM fellowships. the global health tracks currently implemented within these two training programs combine local global health\u2013oriented didactics and journal clubs with rotations at international sites. the PCCM global health pathway leverages these longstanding collaborations in Kenya to conduct studies of chronic lung diseases and air pollution. established partnerships between U.S. institutions and international sites generate a wide array of projects that can be adapted to locally relevant clinical and research concerns.
