{"summary": "PRRSV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae (1). the virus-caused economic loss in the united states alone is estimated to be $560 million per year (2). PRRSV is a significant issue to the swine industry across the world. ing of type I IFNs is initiated after they bind to their receptors on the cell surface (16\u201318) this receptor binding activates Janus kinases (JAK), which then phosphorylate both signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. PRRSV inhibits the IFN-activated JAK/STAT signal transduction and expression of ISGs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells. VR-2385 Nsp1 diminished the protein's ability to reduce KPNA1. the replacement of the nucleotide at the same position caused a reduction of KPNA1. this discovery provides further insight into PRRSV interference with IFN-activated signaling. the pCAGGS-FLAG-KPNA1, -KPNA2, -KPNA3, and -KPNA4 plasmids were obtained from Addgene (24) the pCDNA3-Ubiquitin-Myc plasmid was provided by X. Zhu (The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY) the cDNA sequences of Nsp1 were amplified from cDNA of strains VR-2385, a mutation of A to G at nucleotide 55 of MLV Nsp1 was also performed. the primer 2385nt55R was replaced with 2332nsp1R and primer 2385nt55F with 2332nsp1R. the resulting recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies against phosphorylated STAT1 at tyrosine-701 (pSTAT1) (Millipore, Billerica, MA), KPNA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ubiquitin (Santa Cruz), hemagglutinin (HA); FLAG (Sigma), STAT2 (Santa Cruz), and -tubulin (Sigma) the IP samples were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against pSTAT1, ubiquitin, FLAG, and HA. ubiquitinated KPNA1 was included in the lysis buffer at a final concentration of 2.53 M. RNA isolation and real-time PCR were conducted as previously described. pEGFP-C1-STAT1 plasmid for STAT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was obtained from Addgene (24) the pCAGGS-FLAG-KPNA1, -KPNA2, -KPNA3, and -KPNA4 plasmids were provided by M. L. Shaw (the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY) PCR was done with primers 85nsp1F2 and 2385nt55R for fragment 1. the second-round PCR was done with primers 85nsp1F2 and 85nsp1R2 for overlapping PCR on both fragment 1 and 2. the product of the overlapping PCR was cloned into the pCAGEN-HA vector. protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (25, 26). the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies against phosphorylated STAT1 at tyrosine-701 (pSTAT1). the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and incubated with FLAG antibody (Sigma), followed by incubation with protein G-agarose. the final pellet from IP was subjected to elusion with Laemmli sample buffer or 100 mM glycine solution, pH 3.0. the coverslips were mounted onto slides using Fluoromount-G clear mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) the coverslips were incubated overnight, and transfected. western blotting of whole-cell lysates showed similar levels of pSTAT1 in cells with or without Nsp1 expression. the KPNA1 levels in cells with Nsp1 were lower than the KPNA1 levels in control cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing KPNA1. IP and Western blotting showed that the pSTAT1 levels in cells with MLV Nsp1 were similar to the pSTAT1 levels in control cells. the results indicate that VR-2385 Nsp1 reduced pSTAT1/KPNA1 complexes in cells after IFN stimulation. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Nsp1 and a plasmid expressing KPNA1, KPNA2, or KPNA4. the results confirmed that Nsp1 specifically reduced KPNA1 levels. densitometry analysis of experimental results showed relative KPNA1 and Nsp1 levels after normalization with tubulin. incremental amounts of Nsp1-HA plasmid DNA were shown on the x axis. MG132 treatment of cells with the expression of VR-2385 or VR-2332 Nsp1 resulted in the restoration of KPNA1 to levels similar to the levels in the cells with empty vector. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Nsp1-HA and KPNA1-FLAG plasmids. MG132 treatment of cells with Nsp1 expression restored KPNA1 levels. this was due to degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. hek293 cells were transfected with KPNA1-FLAG, ubiquitin-Myc, and VR-2385 Nsp1-HA plasmids. blotting with ubiquitin antibody showed stronger signals in the lane with Nsp1 than in the lane with the empty vector. whole-cell lysate was used in the blotting, which showed that Nsp1 did not induce elevation of total ubiquitination in the cells. Western blotting of IP samples with antibodies against ubiquitin and tubulin. HEK293 cells cotransfected with KPNA1-FLAG and VR-2385 Nsp1 plasmids were treated with cycloheximide. the KPNA1 level 6 h after the cycloheximide treatment was reduced 0.5-fold in the cells with Nsp1 expression. expression of Nsp1 induced a shortening of the KPNA1 half-life from approximately 21 h to 6 h. the Nsp1 half-life was approximately 17 h. endogenous KPNA1 levels in HEK293 cells with expression of Nsp1 deletion constructs. cells with Nsp1 D1 and Nsp1 D2 had significantly lower KPNA1 levels than cells transfected with empty vector. the KPNA1 levels in cells with empty vector were 0.8- and 1.1-fold respectively. full-length Nsp1 was included as a control and resulted in lower KPNA1 levels. the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1 to 55) of Nsp1 was correlated with the degradation of KPNA1. western blotting showed that the KPNA1 levels in the cells with the mutant Nsp1 of VR-2385 were similar to those found in cells with the empty-vector control. densitometry analysis showed that the KPNA1 levels in the cells with the mutant Nsp1 of VR-2385 were 0.37-, 0.88-, 0.49-, and 1.18-fold compared to those in cells with the empty-vector control. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type (VR) or Nsp1 mutant (V19I) plasmids. at 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with IFN- at 300 U/ml. at 10 h later, the cells were harvested for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant Nsp1 plasmids of VR-2385. IFN- was added to the cells 48 h after the transfection. the cells were harvested 10 h after the IFN stimulation. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV strain VR-2385, MLV, or VR-2332. compared to the levels in mock-infected cells, KPNA1 levels in cells infected with VR-2385 and VR-2332 were reduced to 0.48-fold. RT-qPCR was done to quantify KPNA1 mRNA at 24 h.p.i. Fold changes in comparison with the amounts of mRNA in MARC-145 cells detected by RT-qPCR. p1 reduces STAT1/KPNA1 complex after interferon stimulation. PRRSV VR-2385 Nsp1 reduces complexes of phosphorylated STAT1 interacting with karyopherin-1. VR-2385 Nsp1 reduces complexes of phosphorylated STAT1 and KPNA1. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were treated with IFN- for 1.25 h. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Nsp1 of VR-2385, VR-2332, and MLV. hek293 cells were cotransfected with Nsp1 and a plasmid expressing KPNA1, KPNA2, or KPNA4. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids of KPNA1-FLAG and Nsp1-HA. at 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for Western blotting. the KPNA1 levels were reduced from 0.88- to 0.4-fold in the cells transfected with 0.125 to 1 g of Nsp1 plasmid DNA. the results suggested that the reduction could be due to a decrease of transcription and/or translation. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Nsp1-HA and KPNA1-FLAG plasmids. at 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with MG132. overexpression of KPNA1 was also detected to exclude possibility that overexpression of Nsp1 affected expression of exogenous KPNA1. 293 cells were transfected with KPNA1-FLAG, ubiquitin-Myc, and VR-2385 Nsp1-HA plasmids. western blotting with ubiquitin antibody was then performed to detect ubiquitinated KPNA1 in the cells with Nsp1 expression. the results indicate that Nsp1 did not induce elevation of total ubiquitination in the cells. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with KPNA1-FLAG, VR-2385 Nsp1-HA, and ubiquitin-Myc plasmids. the cells cotransfected with KPNA1-FLAG, VR-2385 Nsp1-HA, and ubiquitin-Myc were lysed for IP. KPNA1, Nsp1, and tubulin were detected by Western blotting. the half-life in the presence of Nsp1 was shortened from approximately 21 h to 6 h. four fragments of Nsp1 were cloned into the pCAGEN-FLAG vector. overexpression of Nsp1 truncation constructs in HEK293 cells was confirmed. endogenous KPNA1 levels in HEK293 cells with expression of Nsp1 deletion constructs. western blotting was done with antibodies against KPNA1 and tubulin. densitometry analysis showed fold changes of KPNA1 levels. the results from the Nsp1 deletion constructs showed that the amino-terminal domain was correlated with the degradation of KPNA1. the two nucleotides result in two different amino acids, valine at residue 19 and serine at residue 151 for VR-2332 Nsp1 and isoleucine and phenylalanine. the presence of valine-19 in VR-2385 Nsp1 with isoleucine-19 has no effect on KPNA1 levels. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with KPNA1-FLAG and Nsp1-HA plasmids. mutant VR-2385 Nsp1 loses inhibitory effect on IFN-induced elevation of STAT2 protein. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with KPNA1-FLAG and wild-type (MLV) or mutant Nsp1 plasmids. western blotting showed that after IFN treatment, the STAT2 protein level was considerably lower in cells with Nsp1 expression than in cells with empty vector. Conversely, the cells with mutant Nsp1 had STAT2 levels similar to the levels in cells with empty-vector control. to confirm the effect of valine-19 on Nsp1, we conducted mutagenesis of MLV Nsp1 to mutate isoleucine-19 to valine. RT-qPCR was done to quantify KPNA1 mRNA levels in MARC-145 cells after PRRSV infection. the results showed that KPNA1 transcripts in the cells with PRRSV infection had no significant difference from those in control cells. the cells were harvested at 16, 24, and 38 h.p.i. to test the kinetics of KPNA1 expression after PRRSV infection. the cells were harvested at the indicated times (h) after infection. expression had smaller amounts of pSTAT1/KPNA1 complexes. the total levels of pSTAT1 remained unchanged. the total KPNA1 levels were reduced in the cells with Nsp1 expression. al half of Nsp1 contains the functional domain responsible for the KPNA1 degradation. deletion constructs D1 and D2 contain the N-terminal domain. expression resulted in KPNA1 reduction to a level similar to that induced by full-length Nsp1. a mutation at nucleotide 55 from G to A diminished VR-2385 Nsp1's ability to inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. both VR-2385 and VR-2332 reduced KPNA1, while MLV did not. only two nucleotides that differed between the VR-2385 and MLV Nsp1s were potentially associated with KPNA1 reduction. p1s is either valine or isoleucine, which are highly conserved across the strains in type 2 PRRSV. the stretch of residues around valine-19 has also been shown to be involved in inhibition of type I IFN induction (35) the mutant virus recovered was able to induce higher levels of type I IFN transcripts in infected macrophages. VP24 interacts with KPNA1 in the region overlapping with pSTAT1. the ORF6 product of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disrupts nuclear import of pSTAT1 by tethering KPNA2 to endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane. PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells led to lower KPNA1 levels. presence of valine-19 in the N-terminal domain of Nsp1 was found to correlate with the KPNA1 degradation."}
