{"summary": "astroviurses (HAstVs) have been recognized as one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in children, associated with 2\u20138% of infections. astroviruses are classified within the unassigned Astroviridae family. genome 6.4\u20137.9 kb long comprised of a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), three open reading frames (ORFs) the region encodes a non-structural polyprotein (serine protease), ORF1b encodes a polyprotein including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein [18]. the viruses lack a RNA-helicase domain encode in 2004, two genera were recognized; Mamastrovirus (MAstV) and Avastrovirus (AAstV) that were known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively,. viruses were classified solely on the species of origin. however, the advent of sequence based characterization rendered this approach inadequate. iAstV), bats (BAstV), rats (RAstV), mice, rabbit (RabAstV), fox, marmot (HHMastV), porcupine, shrew, vole, and larger species including deer (CcAstV), monkeys, water buffalo (BufAstV), yak, camel (DcAstV), and cheetah (ChAstV) phylogenetic tree of Mamastrovirus (MAstV) capsid (a) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (b) genes. tree was generated from nucleotide sequences using maximum-likelihood method. proposed species yet to be recognized are designated with a symbol. vastrovirus GI.B, and avastrovirus GII.A were renamed respectively. tree was generated from nucleotide sequences using maximum-likelihood method. trees with full taxa names are provided as Supplementary Materials. the ORF1a region encodes a non-structural polyprotein (serine protease), ORF1b encodes a polyprotein including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein. the viruses lack a RNA-helicase domain encoded within the genome and utilize a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to translate the RdRp. in 2004, two genera were recognized; Mamastrovirus (MAstV) and Avastrovirus (AAstV) that were known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively, and viruses were classified solely on the species of origin. the advent of sequence based characterization rendered this approach inadequate, revealing that viruses isolated from different species can be genetically similar. the current ICTV classification reveals 19 recognized species of Mamastrovirus (MAstV-1\u201319) within two genogroups GI and GII; Mamastrovirus 1 (GI.A-human); Mamastrovirus 2 (GI.B-feline); Mamastrovirus 3 (GI.C-porcine); Mamastrovirus 4 (GI.D-California sea lion); Mamastrovirus 5 (GI.E-canine); Mamastrovirus 7 (GII. phylogenetic tree of Mamastrovirus (MAstV) capsid (a) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (b) genes were generated from nucleotide sequences using the maximum-likelihood method. trees with full taxa names are designated with a symbol. maximum-likelihood tree of Avastrovirus (AAstV) (a) capsid and (b) RdRp genes. tree generated from nucleotide sequences using maximum-likelihood method. trees with full taxa names are provided as Supplementary Materials. surveillance has revealed that HAstV-1 is the most commonly detected type in children, followed by HAstV-2\u20135, whereas HAstV-6\u20138 have been rarely detected. HAstV-4 and HAstV-8 have been associated with infection of older children. the majority of MLB1 strains characterized to date have been detected in India, Kenya, and Japan with limited detected in the USA, China, Bhutan, Egypt, Brazil, and Italy. a seroepidemiologic study in the USA revealed that primary exposure to MLB1 occurs in childhood and that seropositivity reached 100% by adulthood suggesting the widespread circulation of the virus in the human population [41]. VA4 has only been detected in Nepal [43] and the BF34 strain has only been detected in burkina faso [45]. VA1/HMO-C viruses have been detected and associated with encephalitis in immunocompromized children and adults. prevalence of VA1/HMO-C viruses in stools ranges from 0.2% to 1.6% in diarrheic and non-diarrheic subjects worldwide. surveillance has revealed that HAstV-1 is the most commonly detected type in children, followed by HAstV-2\u20135, whereas HAstV-6\u20138 have been rarely detected. a HAstV-4 strain was also isolated from an infant with fatal meningoencephalitis [30]. a HAstV-4 strain was also isolated from an infant with fatal meningoencephalitis. MLB3 has been associated with meningitis and other CNS complications. prevalence in stools ranges from 0.6% to 3.1% [40,44]. MAstV-8 There is a dual naming system for some HAstV species due to the simultaneous characterization of these viruses. divergent human astrovirus-like virus tentatively named Bastrovirus was isolated from patients in the Netherlands. the capsid region is homologous to the capsid of HAstV while the RdRp region is more closely related to members of the Hepeviridae family. the capsid regions clusters closest to the MLB1-3 viruses suggesting an evolutionary relationship to these divergent human astroviruses. porcine strains may have been transmitted to cats and subsequently to humans. it is not clear if this is a recent transmission from domesticated cats or if the virus is circulating independently in cheetahs. canine strains form a small, discrete cluster comprising species MAstV-5. 80% of studies suggest that pigs may be persistently infected with various strains of PAstV. swine are highly permissive to astrovirus infection often without symptoms of disease. swine are highly permissive to astrovirus infection often without symptoms of disease. bovine astrovirus strains are not associated with a significant burden of diarrheal disease in bovine species. the first bovine astrovirus was detected in England in 1978 [66] and bovine astrovirus strains have been detected in association with neurological disease, including encephalitis [14,15,16,67,68,69]. one of the mammalian species with the highest burden of symptomatic astrovirus infection is mink; infection is associated with pre-weaning diarrhea syndrome and the neurological condition \u201cshaking mink syndrome\u201d [17,76]. mink viruses cluster within multiple lineages suggesting that the species is permissive to infection with multiple, diverse lineages of viruses. minke whale and BdAstV-3 strains are divergent to characterized astrovirus strains. a single divergent feline strain along with a fox strain cluster comprised of human HMO strains (MAstV-8 and -9), sea lion (MAstV-11), unclassified sea lion, mink (MAstV-21) and bat (MAstV-12) strains. TAstV-1 comprises TAstV-1, AAstV-2 comprised of ANV1 and ANV2 and AAstV-3 comprised of TAstV-2 and duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1) there are numerous yet-to-be classified viruses, including turkey astrovirus 3 (TAstV-3), chicken astrovirus A (CAstV-A), chicken astrovirus B (CAstV-B), TAstV-2 is the predominant TAstV lineage, with a wider global circulation and greater genetic diversity compared to TAstV-1. based on phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene there appears to be limited interspecies transmission of TAstV-2-like viruses detected in chicken and duck. tV-A viruses form smaller, discrete lineage, clustering closest to DAstV-2 strains. CAstV strains have limited detection in other avian species with sporadic detection in pigeon and duck. first serotype of ANV (ANV-1) was isolated from a healthy broiler chick in 1976. the virus designated pigeon ANV (P-ANV) was detected during an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in young pigeons in china [103] based on phylogenetic analysis, P-ANV strains share a high degree of genetic similarity to ANV-2 strains and cluster closely with strains also circulating in china suggesting a localized transmission event. this may reflect common recombination events between ANV strains, but the analysis of a small region does not DAstV-1 is closely related to other unclassified duck strains. DAstV-2 strains are more closely related to TAstV-2 strains. astrovirus DAstV-3/CPH has been suggested to transmit horizontally and vertically. TAstV Avian astrovirus have been detected in outbreaks of enteric disease in turkey poults. avian astrovirus were first reported as agent of gastroenteritis and mortality in young turkeys in 1980. sporadic reports of astrovirus outbreaks in turkeys, associated with a condition known as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) the capsid region is distinct to TAstV-2 strains, forming a discrete cluster in a lineage of unclassified viruses. these GFAstVs were possibly derived from recombination and interspecies events followed by sustained transmission in the guineafowl population. this highlights the limitation of classifying viruses based on a single region of the genome. the first serotype of ANV (ANV-1) was isolated from a healthy broiler chick in 1976 [99] and was initially regarded as a picornavirus. the second serotype (ANV-2) was later described from chicks with stunted growth. a third serotype (ANV-3) was proposed based on sequencing of the ORF1a region. DAstV Astrovirus infection in ducks has been associated with a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis. the 9th ICTV report classified DHV-2 and DHV-3 as DAstV-1 and DAstV-2 respectively. DAstV-2 viruses, currently unclassified, form a discrete, highly conserved cluster closest to CAstV-A strains. novel stV strains circulating in duck species have limited detection in other avian species including geese. fewer land dwelling wild birds have been found to harbor avian astroviruses including doves and pigeons (order Colombiformes), european roller (order Coraciiformes), and black-naped monarch (order Passeriformes) viruses from multiple species, all recognized to cause neurological symptoms, are closely related including human VA1/HMO-C viruses and mink and bovine viruses also associated with neurological symptoms. there appears to be a high degree of cross species transmission of avian astroviruses between farmed poultry species. mink strains detected in china represent novel clade of astroviruses. these viruses are recombinant strains with the capsid region clustering with CAstV-B strains and the RdRp region clustering with human MAstV strains. a strain clustering close to ANV-1 strains detected in turkey and chicken was isolated from a child in the Gambia. astroviruses have been detected in the environment and the durability of the virus in this environment may greatly contribute to cross-species transmission within and between terrestrial and aquatic species. both intra-species and inter-species recombination can rapidly generate novel, divergent viruses. a recombinant strain derived from porcine astrovirus and human HAstV-3 strains was reported from piglets and children from various regions of Colombia [62]. a recombinant strain derived from recombination events between ANV-1 (ORF1b) and ANV-2 (ORF2) have been described in the USA [85]. a nomenclature that records the appropriate metadata associated with sample collection would vastly improve the usability of strains for more complex analyses."}
