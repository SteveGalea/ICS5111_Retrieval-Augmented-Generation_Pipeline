{"summary": "inTRODUCTION KSHV is associated with various human malignancies. the immune-compromised individuals have higher prevalence. the viral latency in infected cells can be reversed to lytic phase by various chemical inducers and viral gene products. Egr-1 regulates genes of various pathways that are involved in cellular proliferation [28, 29], differentiation [30, 31] and apoptosis [32\u201334]. extracellular stimuli trigger the expression of Egr-1, to modulate various signaling cascades through alteration of target genes expression [35\u201337]. induction of Egr-1 phosphorylation followed by enhanced virion production have been evidenced by Okadaic acid treatment. suppression of both phosphor-Egr-1 and generation of virions seemed to occur on incubating with p38 MAP kinase/Raf inhibitors. reactivation of KSHV is triggered by various stimuli in which RTA plays a predominant role. role of Egr-1 as a cellular transcription factor depicts its various functional properties. resveratrol is known to activate MAPK family members such as p38, ERK 1/2 and JNK. the expression level of RTA was also monitored at 12, 24 and 48h. both the KSHV positive cells, BC-3 and BCBL-1, depleted for Egr-1, showed reduced levels of RTA expression at all the time points post-induction. BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells transfected with (scr/Egr-1 siRNA) were analyzed for RTA expression after induction for respective time points, 0, 12, 24 and 48h. the densitometric analyses of RTA expression at respective time points, 0, 12, 24 and 48h. kinases controlling Egr-1 phosphorylation needed to be determined. we used Okadaic acid, an inducer of Egr-1 phosphorylation [62], to treat BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells. this enhanced Egr-1 phosphorylation in BC-3 and BCBL-1 cells. BC-3 and b. BCBL-1 cells were treated with the combination of Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml); Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml) and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (30 ng/ml); Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml) and GW5074 (50 M) respectively for 24h. ions were processed for viral genome extraction and quantification through qPCR. a. BC-3 and b. cells were treated with the combination of Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml); Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml) and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (30 ng/ml); Okadaic acid (30 ng/ml) and GW5074 (50 M) the results showed an upregulation of RTA promoter with a gradual increase in concentration of CBP and p300. the cooperative effect of CBP and Egr-1 was higher as compared to the combined dosage of p300 and Egr-1 in modulating the RTA promoter. 10 106 BC-3 cells were induced with TPA for 24h. the cells were harvested and processed for the detection of Egr-1 phosphorylation through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. 2 106 293T cells were co-transfected with either RTAp (0.1g); RTAp (0.1g), p300 (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), p300 (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), CBP (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), CBP (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), Egr-1 (0.5g), CBP (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), Egr-1 (0.5g), C 2 106 293T cells were transfected with either RTAp (0.1g); RTAp (0.1g), CBP (0.5g), p300 (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), Egr-1 (0.5g), CBP (0.5g); RTAp (0.1g), Egr-1 (0.5g), CBP (0.5g), CBP (0.5g), p300 (0.5g) the cells were harvested after 48h post-transfection for luciferase truncation from 550 to 298 removed CRE and C/EBP binding sites. this may have contributed to a significant reduction in the promoter activity. however, we wanted to confirm the significance of Egr-1 binding site on CBP/p300 mediated RTA promoter upregulation. a total of 2 106 293T cells were cotransfected with the combination of Egr-1 (0.5g), CBP (0.5g), p300 (0.5g) and RTAp-2570 (0.1g)/RTAp-2039 (0.1g)/RTAp-1490 (0.1g)/RTAp-1327 (0.1g)/RTAp-500 (0.1g)/RTAp-298 (0.1g)/RTAp-169 (0.1g). 293T cells were transfected with: lane 1- RTA promoter (with Egr-1 binding site) 0.1g; lane 2- RTA promoter (mutated Egr-1 binding site) 0.1g, CBP (0.5g), p300 (0.5g) and Egr-1 (0.5g) the binding of p300 was also detected at RTA promoter during viral reactivation. the recruitment of CBP was lower than Egr-1 at RTA promoter. however, comparative binding of both Egr-1 and CBP at RTA promoter was higher in the induced cells than the uninduced cells. the comparison was made between the phosphorylated form of Egr-1 from uninduced and induced cells. we confirmed that the higher binding of CBP to Egr-1 was not due to a higher level of CBP in induced cells. these results indicated the possibility that Egr-1 phosphorylation could be responsible for its enhanced binding with CBP during viral reactivation. -1 is one of the key factors in regulating viral reactivation. to this end, we used a monocytic cells, THP-1 and endothelial cells, HUVECs for de novo infection. the infection of HUVECs and THP-1 with KSHV showed phosphorylation. 2106 HUVECs were infected with either live or UV inactivated KSHV at 10 m.o.i for 12h. the target cells were harvested and processed for luciferase assay. 106 HUVECs were transfected with either RTA promoter (mutated Egr-1 binding site) or RTA promoter (mutated Egr-1 binding site) concentration of plasmids transfected were 0.1g, 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g and 0.5g respectively. target cells were harvested and processed for luciferase assay.

Okadaic acid in combination with p38MAP kinase inhibitor or Raf inhibitor leads to a reduction in Egr-1 phosphorylation. also enhanced Egr-1 phosphorylation leads to higher copies of virion produced as compared to those with suppressed Egr-1 phosphorylation. ic acid could be used to decipher the involvement of various kinases involved in the regulation of Egr-1 phosphorylation in KSHV infected cells. we have studied the role of Egr-1 and CBP in regulating RTA promoter activity during de novo primary infection. the Egr-1 depleted cells infected with KSHV showed a significant reduction in RTA transcripts level. this observation was again confirmed by overexpressing Egr-1 in the target cells before infecting with KSHV. the balance between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of Egr-1 might be an essential criterion for the maintenance of latent and lytic states of KSHV. the HUVECs were cultured in endothelial growth medium (M200, ThermoFisher Scientific) with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the BJAB cells stably infected with recombinant KSHV.219 were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. 2 106 293T cells were grown overnight per well in a 6 well plate. the cells were harvested 48h post-transfection, lysed and used for the reporter assay. results presented were the average of triplicate experiments with the error bars. the immunoprecipitated proteins were pelleted and washed three times with RIPA buffer containing 300 mM NaCl. the proteins were electroblotted to the nitrocellulose membrane, probed with appropriate antibodies, washed and then developed with infrared dye-tagged secondary antibodies using Odyssey Imager. the extracted DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction. the primers used were ORF50 forward, 5\u2032-CTACCGGCGACTCATTAAG-3\u2032, and ORF50 reverse, 5\u2032-GTGGCTGGACAGTAT-3\u2032. cDNA was synthesized using a high Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) virions were concentrated through ultracentrifugation at 25000 rpm for 2h at 4\u00b0C. the concentrated virion pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI1640. about 100l of the virions were used for viral DNA extraction and quantification. the protocol for nucleofection was followed according to instructions provided by manufacturer. the FITC conjugated scrambled siRNA (100 pmol) was used as control for monitoring the efficiency of siRNA transfection. the medium was removed after 12h of siRNA transfection and replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS for THP-1 and endothelial growth medium. for viral entry experiments, THP-1 and HUVECs were infected with KSHV for 2h. the cells were harvested and proceeded for genome extraction. the target gene ORF58 was used as a reference. pMX-Egr-1 was sub-cloned using primers S-Egr-1 (HindIII)-5\u2032-AACTTAAGCTTCATGGCGGCGC-3\u2032; AS-Egr-1 (EcoRI) 5\u2032 CTGCAGAATTTCAA-3\u2032. pGL3-RTA promoter, p300-myc (Addgene) was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Lieberman. target cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 0.5 ml ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 [NP-40], 10 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl) chromatin immunoprecipitation assay A total of 10 106 BC-3 and 10 106 BCBL-1 cells were treated with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde and cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature. cross-linked cells were washed in 1X PBS and counted so that approximately 8 106 cells were used in each immunoprecipitation reactions. cDNA was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) the synthesized cDNA was subjected to amplification on an ABI StepOne Plus real-time PCR machine. the gene expression data was normalized to the levels of housekeeping gene, GAPDH. the concentrated virion pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI1640. a total of 2106 HUVECs/ 2106 THP-1 was plated per well in 6 well plates. a total of 100 pmol (Egr-1) and 100 pm (CBP) were mixed together. the efficiency of Egr-1/CBP silencing was checked after 48h of siRNA transfection through western blotting. the cells were spun down for 5 min at 1200 rpm prior to infection. the cells were resuspended in 2ml of RPMI complete medium with virions. cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 2 h at room temperature. excess stain was washed with deionized water and samples were allowed to dry at room temperature."}
