{"summary": "H7N9 influenza is a recently emerging infection and has a high rate of mortality. Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation (1,2) Cytokines and immune cells regulate the immune response to viral infection, mediate inflammatory responses, and are involved in tissue damage and repair. all patients had been treated with oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and methylprednisolone (1\u20132 mg/kg/day) antibiotics given to all patients included moxifloxacin, sulbactam and cefoperazone. some patients also received continuous renal replacement therapy (n=4) and mechanical ventilation therapy (n=7) samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Epics XL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.) results are expressed as the percentages of the T-cell subset in the total lymphocyte population. FITC-CD8 mAb, cat. no. 6602385; PE-PD-1 mAb. 100 l sodium citrate anticoagulant was added to the sample in each flow tube. mouse fluorescence-labeled mAbs were then added (10 l) mAb, PE-IL-4 mAb or PE-IL-17A mAb (10 l) according to manufacturer's recommendations. one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparisons tests were used. mAbs fluorescently labeled with phycoerythrin (PE), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin-anthocyanidin (PE-Cy5) and phycoerythrin-anthocyanidin (PE-Cy5) were purchased from BD Biosciences. FITC-CD45 mAb; PE-Cy5-CD3 mAb; ECD-CD8 mAb, cat. no. 6604728), NK cells (FITC-CD45 mAb; PE-Cy5-CD3 mAb; PE-CD56 mAb, cat. no. IM2073U), regulatory T cells (Tregs; FITC-CD4 mAb, cat. no. 6604551), regulatory T FITC-IFN- mAb, FITC-IFN- mAb, cat. no. IM2716U) and Th17 cells (CD3+CD8IL4+ T cells; ECD-CD3 mAb; PE-Cy5-CD8 mAb; PE-IL-4 mAb, cat. no. IM2719U), 50 l whole blood was treated with hemolysis reagent (BD PharmingenTM) the ages of the patients ranged from 20 to 75 years, and the median age was 69 years. the study was approved by the Ethics and Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin-anthocyanidin (PE-Cy5) or phycoerythrin-Texas red (ECD) were used. the samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Epics XL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.) monocytes (PE-CD14 mAb, cat. no. IM0650U; FITC-CD16 mAb, cat. no. IM2636U; PE-PD-1 mAb) and CD8+PD-1+T cells (FITC-CD8 mAb, cat. no. 6602385; PE-PD-1 mAb) whole blood was treated with hemolysis reagent (BD PharmingenTM; San Diego, CA, USA) for 4\u20136 h. cells were harvested, stained with ECD-CD3 mAb and PE-Cy5-CD8 mAb (10 l), then stained with FITC-IFN- mAb, PE-IL-4 mAb or PE-IL-17A mAb (10 l) NK, natural killer; Th, T helper; PD-1, programmed death 1; Treg, regulatory T cell. both NK cell and monocyte frequencies were found to be increased initially. all cases were classified as having a reduction in B cells. the frequencies of NK cells, Th1 cells and Tregs were less than those in the recovery period (P=0.0003, P=0.0001, P=0.013 and P=0.0001, respectively). the frequencies of NK cells, Th1 cells and Tregs exhibited no significant differences between the two periods (P=0.85, P=0.88 and P=0.62, respectively). frequencies in the pathogenesis of the critical H7N9 infection occurred. these frequencies exhibited a normalization trend during recovery. reductions of CD4+T cell andCD8+T cell frequencies occurred during recovery. peripheral Th1 cell, Th2 cell, CD4+PD-1+T cell, Tregs and Th17 cell frequencies fluctuated slightly in a narrow range. all recovering patients exhibited an increased trend of Tregs frequencies. in patients who presented with higher levels of Th1 cells, levels were subsequently reduced during recovery.

PD-1+CD4+T cells 3.780.92 5.900.45 7.520.41a PD-1+CD8+T cells 0.500.15 4.170.79 9.330.81a Tregs 5.950.56 4.280.43 4.020.31c Th17 cells 0.290.75 3.400.47 1.710.22a Data are presented as mean standard deviation. patients with a higher level of NK cells in the progression period exhibited a quicker recovery from the disease. if infection is accompanied by a dynamic NK cell change, this could indicate that the body is in a balance between anti-infective immunity and autoimmune damage. CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells all demonstrated detectable changes. this included an imbalance of CD4/CD8 in the progression stage. this could indicate that the disease progression may be attributed to inhibition of the antiviral immune response of T cells, thereby causing the ratio to balance during recovery. the incidence of severe H1N1 is highest in the 15- to 19-year-old age group. this difference in patient age might be responsible for differences in immune cell differences between H1N1- and H7N9-infections."}
