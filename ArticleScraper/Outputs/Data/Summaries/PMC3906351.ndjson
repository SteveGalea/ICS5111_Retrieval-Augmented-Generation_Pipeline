{"summary": "despite advances in strategic preparedness of US agencies for biodefense, vaccine design remains a significant obstacle to national biodefense. despite these important advances in the strategic preparedness of US agencies for biodefense, vaccine design remains a significant obstacle to national biodefense. avian influenza virus emerging in china has led to even greater scrutiny of methods used to respond to infectious disease public health threats. in 2009\u20132010, the FastVax group began to discuss whether existing tools and vaccine production platforms could be used to accelerate the development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases. the proposed approach would begin with analysis of the genomic sequence of an emerging pathogen with immunoinformatics tools. intracellular proteins are processed and their constituent peptides are loaded onto major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I and class II-peptide complexes are then transported to the surface of an APC. from these different antigen processing and presentation pathways, two distinct T cell responses are generated. epitope-based vaccines can be developed to recreate this response. cross-reactive T cell epitopes were responsible for the limited morbidity and mortality associated with pandemic H1N1 in 2009. a broad-based immune response directed against multiple antigenic proteins associated with the pathogen can be elicited without the need to manufacture and administer large quantities of protein. this is likely to reduce formulation challenges, decrease cost and accelerate the development process. peptide epitopes stimulate protective immune responses in a range of animal models, including complete protection of BALB/c mice against RSV challenge,8 partial protection of BALB/c and CBA mice against encephalitis following intracerebral challenge. cross-reactive T cell epitopes were responsible for the limited morbidity and mortality associated with pandemic H1N1 in 2009. genome sequencing, immunoinformatics tools and epitope-driven approach now make it possible to develop vaccines on demand in response to emerging pathogens. the first step to making \u201cfaster vaccines\u201d is to design vaccine immunogens directly from pathogen genomes. the integration of epitope mapping into a step-by-step vaccine design process makes it possible to design vaccines in the shortest time possible. the overall impact would be minimal, since T cell epitopes are linear; in contrast, sequence variations may compromise the structural integrity of a whole protein vaccine with negative effects on immunogenicity. the fastVax consortium favors DNA vaccines because production is scalable, the vaccines are stable at room temperature, manufacturing can be easily distributed to different geographic locations. alternative scalable and rapid production methods include plant-derived vaccines, phage-based vaccines and recombinant vaccines produced in cell culture. a key principle of rapid biodefense vaccine production is that safety and speed are paramount for eliciting a protective immune response prior to the epidemic. the bulk vaccine product would then be coated onto pre-manufactured micro-needle patches that provide direct delivery to the dermis or would be delivered using another skin-based method such as \u201cscarification\u201d a number of self-applied patch delivery systems have already been developed. vaccines designed to stimulate HLA-restricted human immune responses may not demonstrate the true efficacy of the product. however, alternative approaches may need to be considered. trials will establish correlates of protection for a new influenza vaccine. approval and emergency use authorization for the fastVax vaccine-on-demand system would require close cooperation between the vaccine manufacturer and the agency. the manufacturer can provide clinical safety and efficacy data for a variety of vaccine products based on standardized vaccine platform, manufacturing, specifications, operating procedures and method of delivery. this would involve redundancy and higher costs, but it would allow for the rapid production and scale-up of vaccines at any given moment. genome-derived, epitope-driven vaccine strategy (GD-EDV) first step to making \u201cfaster vaccines\u201d is to design vaccine immunogens directly from pathogen genomes. first step to making \u201cfaster vaccines\u201d is to design vaccine immunogens directly from pathogen genomes. tools for carrying out the task have been applied to the development of vaccine candidates for SARS,23 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza,24 smallpox,25 and a number of emerging and biowarfare agents. tools for carrying out the task have been applied to the development of vaccine candidates for avian-origin influenza. no influenza vaccines containing adjuvants are FDA approved. no influenza vaccines containing adjuvants are approved. a number of strategies are currently being evaluated. cGMP seed lot of bacteria containing the vaccine plasmid with cassetted payload can be rapidly produced and vialed using existing SOPs for release and characterization assays. scale-up for DNA production is much more rapid than traditional vaccine designs; only three to four weeks would be required to produce one million doses per facility. clinical trials There are more than 30 Phase II trials listed in clinicaltrials.gov. FDA approval of a DNA vaccine appears to be on the horizon. but until then, the FastVax DNA vaccine may encounter an additional FDA-associated barrier. immunity as described in the \u201cTwo Animal Rule\u201d may not demonstrate the true efficacy of the product. the MIMIC assay could be used for initial safety studies and to qualify release of actual vaccine intended for emergency use. the manufacturer can provide clinical safety and efficacy data for a variety of vaccine products based on standardized vaccine platform, manufacturing, specifications, operating procedures and method of delivery. the agency may be able to provide a rapid review and emergency use allowance/authorization. release of the vaccine would then be possible through emergency use authorization by the HHS Secretary. in vitro assay like the MIMIC could serve as a release characteristic of the multi-site lots that would run in parallel with the patch loading, preventing a single problematic DNA vaccine batch from impeding the release of patches generated with other batches. pilot runs would need to be undertaken at every facility, most likely with different methods tested, to maximize the likelihood of determining the best method for production. two of 11 vaccinees and five of 11 control subjects developed laboratory-confirmed influenza (symptoms plus virus shedding) symptoms of influenza were less pronounced in the vaccinees. there was a significant reduction in the number of days of virus shedding in those vaccinees who developed influenza. T cell-driven vaccines offer significant advantages over conventional vaccines for infectious diseases. despite strain-to-strain variation at the protein level, immunoinformatics tools can be used to identify highly conserved T cell epitopes that are immunogenic and broadly representative or universal. s for many of the high-priority biodefense pathogens and emerging infectious diseases under development are not currently available. the need for new vaccines for protecting against bioterror pathogens and emerging infectious disease is great, and the time to advance these vaccines is now."}
