{"summary": "emerging rickettsial diseases have been reported throughout the world. these pathogens include spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR, Far eastern spotted fever, Japanese spotted fever, Siberian and Queensland tick typhus) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus, ST) groEL [11] of O. tsutsugamushi and OmpB [7], 17 kDa [9], and gltA [12, 13] of Rickettsia. loop-mediated isothermal amplification has been developed [14\u201320] as a potential alternative for PCR based tests. assays have been developed for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine samples [23], diagnosis of Cryptosporidiosis in animal and patient specimens [30], and detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [31], Francisella tularensis [32], and group B Streptococci [33]. the optimal reaction temperatures for RPA and the detection limit was achieved by both RPA-exo and RPA-nfo. the specificity was evaluated using genomic DNA from closely related microorganisms at 1000 folds excess in copy number. further evaluation was done using DNA extracted from liver, lung and spleen collected from infected mice. primers and probes were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL) and Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma, CA), respectively. experimental design RPA-nfo and RPA-exo kits were both purchased from TwistDx (Cambridge, UK, www.twistdx.co.uk) the purified plasmid was used as a template to optimize the RPA assays. Genomic DNA from multiple strains of O. tsutsugamushi was extracted from renografin gradient purified organisms using QIAamp mini DNA kit (Qiagen, CA) DNA was extracted from 100 l each of the three cultures using the QIAamp Blood and Tissue DNA kit. the bacterial load was determined by qPCR to be within the range of 1010 -1011copies/ml. the final concentration of the 200 l of spiked NHP was 2,000 copies/ml. the reaction mixture contained rehydration buffer, recombinases, and Bsu strand displacing polymerase with the addition of 420 nM each of the forward and reverse primers. 2.5 l of 280 mM magnesium acetate was pipetted into the tube lids. 5 l of DNA was added to the reaction mixture unless otherwise indicated. the DNA was diluted to the desired copy number in a total volume of 5 l to perform the RPA. the reaction was performed a minimum of 6 times for each amount of genomic DNA. only 47-RPA-nfo was performed with 1 L of DNA. qPCR was performed to determine the amount of mouse genomic DNA in the total DNA extracted from organs of O. tsutsugamushi infected mice. the animal study protocol (#D11-06) was reviewed and approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fig 1B shows a general scheme describing the design of the experiments. the two TwistAmp kits used for detection of amplicons using a lateral flow strip, a cross contaminated proof cassette, or a real-time monitoring of fluorescent signal. gene was extracted from 100 l each of the three independently prepared R. typhi cultures using the QIAamp Blood and Tissue DNA kit (Qiagen, CA) the number of R. typhi present in each of the three independently prepared R. typhi cultures was determined. the DNA was used as template for the 17-RPA assay. qPCR was used to quantitate the copy number of the 17 kDa gene. different reaction times, concentrations of primers and probes, and temperatures ranging from 37\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C were evaluated. tubes were briefly agitated at 4 minutes after the reaction was initiated. tubes were placed into a heating block at 37\u00b0C for 20 minutes. the reaction in each tube was monitored in real time following the increase of fluorescent signals. quantitative PCR was performed using 5 l of extracted DNA. qPCR was performed to determine the detection limit of the RPA assay. qPCR was used as a gold standard to quantitate the DNA. set that provided the best detection limit for the individual detection of O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi DNA was identified (Table 1). Primer sequences for qPCR and RPA detection of O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi DNA were identified. all RPA primers and probes are named with nfo or exo to be specifically used for the nfo or exo detection method. the 47-RPA-nfo appeared to be detecting 53 copies/reaction. the detection limit ranged from 10 to 400 copies per reaction. different copy # of pure O. tsutsugamushi genomic DNA as determined by qPCR were added in the RPA reaction. at the end of reaction, amplicons were removed and diluted as described in Materials and Methods for lateral flow strip detection of amplicons. over time was observed no later than 10 minutes post initiation of the reaction. signals plateaued within 20 minutes, suggesting differentiating positive and negative samples based on the slope. different copy # of pure O. tsutsugamushi Karp strain genomic DNA as determined by qPCR were added in the RPA reaction. the same results were obtained using 47-RPA-nfo. positive results were only observed when at least 104 copies/reaction of DNA were present. other SFGR, such as R. honei and R japonica were also evaluated. tospira genomic DNA (purple line), and 6x104 copies per reaction of Bartonella genomic DNA (red line), and negative control (black line) Detection limit of the two RPA methods running at least 6 replicates for each assay. the 47-RPA-nfo and 47-RPA-exo had different detection limits. the 17-RPA-nfo and 17-RPA-exo had very similar detection limits. Percent positive is calculated based on [# of positive/total # of samples tested] for each sample load condition, at least 6 independent replicates were analyzed. 8 out of 10 positives were 47-RPA-nfo positive while all 10 negatives were negative. the 47-RPA was also evaluated using extracted DNA from liver, spleen and lung of infected mice. the same extracted DNA was used as a template for both 47-RPA-exo and 47-RPA-nfo. qPCR negative samples were determined negative by 47-RPA-exo and 47-RPA-nfo. liver, spleen and lungs from five mice each at day 4, 7 and 11 post infection were collected. DNA from one mouse per time point was extracted as described in Materials and Methods. extraction of R. typhi DNA from normal human plasma spiked with R. typhi for evaluation of RPA-exo and RPA-nfo. copy number of 17 kDa gene was determined by qPCR. 10 L of extracted DNA was used for RPA-exo or RPA-nfo detection. the RPA-nfo assay for both 17 kDa gene of R. typhi and 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi was performed as described in Materials and Methods. the appearance of a red line along the T mark indicated the positive detection of FAM labeled probe. pathogens Method Primer/probe name* Primer sequence O. tsutsugamushi qPCR 47-F AACTGATTATTCAAACTAATGCTGCT 47-7F TAAAGTTGCATGATGGTTCAGAACT RPA 47-3R-nfo Biotin-TATTGCAATAACCTGATCCTACTCTAGA 47-3R-exo 5\u2019d FAM-ATTAAATTAATTCTCCAGCAGCATTATCT all RPA primers and probes are named with nfo or exo to be specifically used for the nfo or exo detection method. the 47-RPA-nfo appeared to be detecting 53 copies/reaction. the detection limit ranged from 10 to 400 copies per reaction. different copy # of pure O. tsutsugamushi Karp strain genomic DNA was added in the RPA reaction. at the end of reaction, amplicons were removed and diluted. Lane N: negative control, lanes 1\u20134 contained 130, 45, 20, and 6 copies/reaction of R. typhi DNA, respectively. representative results of RPA-exo for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi or R. typhi genomic DNA were added. different copy # of pure O. tsutsugamushi Karp strain genomic DNA as determined by qPCR were added in the RPA reaction. the same results were obtained using 47-RPA-nfo. positive results were only observed when at least 104 copies/reaction of DNA were present. the performance of 17-RPA-exo was also evaluated using DNA extracted from R. prowazekii. 47-RPA-nfo and 47-RPA-exo had different detection limits. the 17-RPA-nfo and 17-RPA-exo had very similar detection limits. 47-RPA-exo detected 100%, 77% and 42% of samples with 100\u2013120 copies, 40\u201360 copies and 10\u201312 copies per reaction. 40\u201360 77 c 10\u201312 41.7 17- nfo 100\u2013120 100 40\u201360 72.7 20\u201325 71.4 5\u201315 57.1 17- exo 100\u2013120 87.5 40\u201360 90.9 5\u201315 42.9. qPCR confirmed laboratory, O. tsutsugamushi-in. the same extracted DNA was used as a template for both 47-RPA-exo and 47-RPA-nfo. the results showed that 78% sensitivity and 100% specificity was achieved using DNA extracted from organs obtained from O. tsutsugamushi-infected mice. liver, spleen and lungs from five mice each at day 4, 7 and 11 post infection were collected. DNA from one mouse per time point was extracted as described in Materials and Methods. the expected copy number of 17 kDa gene present in each spiked sample was 8 copies per L based on 2000 copies/mL of 200 L of spiked NHP. the expected copy number of 17 kDa gene present in each spiked sample was 8 copies per L based on 2000 copies/mL of 200 L of spiked NHP. typhi and 47 kDa gene of O. tsutsugamushi was performed as described in Materials and Methods. the reaction mixture contained no DNA template and complete primer sets for 47 kDa gene and 17 kDa gene with FAM labeled probes. the appearance of a red line along the T mark indicated the positive detection of FAM labeled probe. the method offers multiple end-point detection options with similar detection limits that could fit into many different laboratory settings. successful detection of O. tsutsugamushi from clinical and mouse samples known to be infected demonstrated the potential clinical application of the assay. a slight difference in detection limit between RPA-nfo and RPA-exo was less pronounced for R. typhi detection. the difference in detection limit was less pronounced for R. typhi detection as shown in Table 2. gene codes one of the major protein antigens recognized by sera from patients infected with many strains of O. tsutsugamushi [40] the sequences of 47 kDa proteins have been compared to show greater than 96% identity [41] between strains. the gene has been used as the target for the development of PCR, qPCR, and LAMP assays. 17 kDa genes from SFGR that were tested share 89% of the identity with the full length 17 kDa gene of R. typhi. the 17 kDa gene of R. conorii, shares 95% of the identity with the 17 kDa gene of R. prowazekii. 8 out of 10 PCR confirmed O. tsutsugamushi positives were positive. 10 out of 10 PCR confirmed O. tsutsugamushi negatives were negative. no samples collected prior to day four post infection had qPCR detectable O. tsutsugamushi. both 47-RPA-exo and\u2013nfo showed consistent results of 78% sensitivity and 100% specificity, similar to the observation made using DNA extracted from scrub typhus patients. this is probably related to the number of live organisms injected into the mice, the naturally-slow growth of O. tsutsugamushi and the rate of dissemination of O. tsutsugamushi once it enters the mice. the XCP cassette was not designed to detect RPA-nfo products. it provides a single XCP cassette that can be used for the detection of practically all FAM (or DIG) labeled probe amplicons, including qPCR, LAMP and RPA-nfo. the sequences of RPA primers targeted region of the 47 kDa gene from 8 strains were analyzed using ClustalW2. there are 13 bases that were mismatched out of 156 bases among the 8 strains. this is greater than 90% (91.7%) identical in sequence among these 8 strains."}
