{"summary": "IFITMs have an average length of 130 amino acids, contain two predicted transmembrane domains and a conserved intracellular domain [2,3] the antiviral function of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was established only when their potent restriction of influenza A virus, west Nile virus and dengue virus was reported. the function of IFITM10 is unknown except that it is the most conserved among all IFITM proteins across many eukaryotic species. IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, inhibit Rift Valley fever virus [7] deleting the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 allows the mutant to potently inhibit both BH10 and NL4\u20133 viruses. this highlights the important role of this C-terminal domain in regulating the antiviral function of IFITM1. Results Human IFITM1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1BH10 but not HIV-1NL4\u20133. the positions of three deletion mutations are indicated. both the wild type and mutated IFITM1 have a Flag tag attached to the N-terminus. IFITM1 mutants diminished HIV-1NL4\u20133 entry by 2 to 3-fold. this inhibition appears to be specific to HIV-1. neither the WT IFITM1 nor its C-terminal truncations affected entry. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA expressing wild type IFITM1 and its mutants (117\u2013125), (112\u2013125) or (108\u2013125) together with Rab5-GFP. localization of IFITM1 and its mutants were determined by immunostaining with anti-Flag antibody. images shown represent the major subcellular distribution of each protein. the deletion mutant exhibited an intracellular localization similar to the wild type IFITM1. this suggests that the mutant may employ a distinct mechanism to deter HIV-1 entry. no apparent endocytic sorting signals are present within the sequence 117-QIIQEKRGY-125 of IFITM1. mouse IFITM1 suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells. further, mouse IFITM1 markedly decreased the entry of HIV-1 but not the entry that was mediated by VSV G protein. these data further highlight the importance of the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 in modulating its antiviral function. exchange of the 2.7kb DNA fragment between the SalI and BamH1 restriction sites allowed BH(SB) resistant to IFITM1 and reciprocally, NL(SB) sensitive to IFITM1 inhibition. this SB DNA fragment encodes four viral proteins, Tat, Rev, Vpu and Env. HIV-1NL4\u20133 is more efficient than HIV-1BH10 in cell-to-cell transmission. similar defects were also observed for HIV-1NL4\u20133 infection of IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. tab SupT1 cells were treated with doxycycline (500 g/ml) for 16 hours to induce IFITM1 expression before infection with HIV-1BH10 (A, B) or HIV-1NL4\u20133 (C, D) forty hours after infection, cells were harvested and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 antibody. results of three independent transmission experiments are summarized in the bar graph. IFITM1 inhibits replication of strain BH10 in SupT1 cells. resistance of an HIV-1NL4\u20133-derived virus called NLENY1-IRES to IFITM1. ulin were probed as internal controls. a representative result of three independent infections is shown. human IFITM1 has a relatively long C-terminal region. WT IFITM1 and its mutants affected entry that was mediated by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) levels of virus entry were determined by monitoring the cleavage of CCF2 by BlaM-Vpr. the periphery of the immunostained cells was outlined with white dot lines. the percentage of IFITM1 at the cell periphery was then calculated. the results obtained from at least 10 cells were shown as meanstandard derivation. docytic sorting signals present within sequence 117-QIIQEKRGY-125 of IFITM1 which was deleted in (117\u2013125) blocking endocytosis caused relocation of IFITM1 to the plasma membrane. removal of its C-terminal sequence causes relocation to the plasma membrane where it interferes with HIV-1 entry. mouse IFITM1 suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells. human IFITM1 and mouse IFITM1 are highlighted in red letters. the two predicted transmembrane domains are indicated. the two predicted transmembrane domains are indicated. HIV-1NL4\u20133 Env enabled HIV-1BH10 to replicate in IFITM1-expressing cells. inserting the Env of HIV-1BH10 into HIV-1NL4\u20133 dramatically reduced virus replication in the presence of IFITM1. we recently reported that HIV-1BH10 became resistant to IFITM1 restriction in the spread infection through acquiring mutations in viral Env and Vpu proteins that together enhance the virus transmission between cells. this phenotype was readily reversed when the Env sequence was exchanged between HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133. similar observations were made for virus transmission from control SupT1 cells to SupT1 cells expressing IFITM1. ELISA to measure HIV-1 p24/CA. results of three independent experiments are summarized in the bar graph. Fig 7. Cell-to-cell transmission of BH10, NL4\u20133 and their chimeric viruses. (A) Cell-to-cell transmission between SupT1 cells that did not express IFITM1. the role of HIV-1 Env protein in determining viral sensitivity to IFITM1 corroborates our recent report showing that HIV-1BH10 was able to develop resistance to IFITM1 through mutating Env and Vpu [27] there are precedents illuminating the function of viral Env in overcoming host restriction. the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission is determined by viral Env protein. inserting the Env sequence of HIV-1BH10 into HIV-1NL4\u20133 diminishes cell-to-cell transmission of the parental virus. this exchange in Env sequences also switches the sensitivity of HIV-1BH10 and HIV-1NL4\u20133 to human IFITM1. HIV-1 entry is pH-independent and occurs at the plasma membrane. VSV enters cells in the endosomes of low pH. removal of the last 9 amino acids from the C-terminus of human IFITM1 relocates this protein from intracellular sites to cell periphery. deleting the C-terminal sequence may change the membrane topology of IFITM1 and disturb its subcellular localization. it remains to be determined if other HIV-1 strains are also differentially inhibited by human IFITM1. pRetroX-Tight-Pur mutants (117\u2013125), (112\u2013125) and (108\u2013125) have different lengths of the C-terminal sequence. the cDNA clone of mouse ifitm1 was purchased from ATCC, amplified by PCR, and cloned into pRetroX-Tight-Pur to generate Tet-mIFTM1. virus stocks were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells with HIV-1 proviral DNA clone using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) the viruses were aliquoted, used immediately or stored at -80\u00b0C for future use. M-Vpr that has HIV-1 envelope protein, and NLENY1/VSV-G/BlaM-Vpr that has the VSV-G protein as the envelope. the amount of viruses in each stock was determined by measuring viral p24(CA) in ELISA. cells were labeled with a cell tracker BMQC (Invitrogen) after 8 hours, the cell mixtures were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. after staining with FITC-conjugated anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody, the donor and target cells were scored. the cDNA of human ifitm1 gene was inserted into the pRetroX-Tight-Pur vector. the cDNA clone of mouse ifitm1 was purchased from ATCC. a flag tag was added to the N-terminus of mIFITM1 to facilitate detection by western blotting. retrovirus stocks were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells with HIV-1 proviral DNA clone using Lipofectamine2000. virus growth was monitored by measuring viral reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatants at different time intervals. the virus stocks were first produced by transfecting the HEK293T cells using either HIV-1NL4\u20133 proviral DNA or the NLENY1-IRES-ES DNA (Env-) and the pCMV-VSV-G DNA together with pCMV-BlaM-Vpr. the amount of viruses in each stock was determined by measuring viral p24(CA) in ELISA. cell mixtures were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. cells were stained with indicated primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) the nuclei were stained by DAPI. imageJ software was used for post-acquisition measurement of the fluorescent intensity. effects of IFITM2 and 3 on the replication of HIV-1NL4\u20133."}
