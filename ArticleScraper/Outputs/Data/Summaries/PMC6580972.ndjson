{"summary": "henipaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Paramyxoviridae. they have mortality rates in humans ranging from 40% to 100%. vaccine strategies have been explored, but none have been approved for use in humans. paramyxoviruses that bind sialic acid generally conform to this model (16\u201320) the attachment glycoprotein G and the F precursor F0 tightly assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. in this model, the strength of H and F interactions is reduced for proteolytically cleaved F (F1 + F2) while presumably still blocking premature F triggering. fusion peptide located at the N terminus of F1 is inserted into the neighboring cell membrane, forming a prehairpin intermediate (PHI) further conformational changes bring together two highly conserved heptad repeat regions located in F1 (HR1 and HR2) into a six-helix bundle (6HB) after fusion conformation. fusion protein chimeric constructs have further elucidated the role of the fusion protein in regulating membrane fusion. a study showed that switching an 45-amino-acid residue region in canine distemper virus (CDV) F to that of a homologous MeV F region resulted in fusion when triggered by MeV H (34). extracellular tags (HA) have been used for henipavirus Gs. but they have not been described for the F glycoproteins (8). results revealed equal homologous but unequal heterologous glycoprotein F-triggering capabilities. a FLAG tag was inserted just N terminal to the cathepsin L cleavage site. an AU1 tag, inserted at the intracellular C terminus of F (type I transmembrane protein), has been previously used for the detection of NF and HF. an insertion of a FLAG tag in the ectodomain of the related morbilliviruses canine distemper virus (CDV) and measles virus (MeV) does not significantly modulate their bioactivity. the henipaviral Fs are processed by cathepsin L and not furin. nuclei in syncytia per field are 200; five fields for each combination, n 4 independent experiments. neither the sequence, position of the tag, nor the presence of both tags significantly altered the fusogenic capacity of the fusion protein significantly. fusion levels significantly lower than those of the wild type for the NF/HG pair. the heterologous NF and HF (FCSE, 47.9% and 58.4% respectively) and the heterologous NG and HG (GCSE, 88.9% and 90.1% respectively) were expressed similarly on the cell surface (P > 0.05) however, GCSE levels appeared to be affected by the F glycoprotein expressed. we used mean FIs (FIMean) for each glycoprotein combination. this is the combined mean for FIs calculated with GCSE and FCSE. however, heterotypic fusion yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype for the NF/HG pair. effector HEK293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and chimeric fusion and attachment glycoproteins. target HEK293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and chimeric fusion and attachment glycoproteins. effector HEK293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and DSP2. syncytium counts measure nuclei inside cell-cell fusion events. syncytium counts measure nuclei inside cell-cell fusion events. HEK293T cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C to synchronize receptor binding. subsequently cells were allowed to undergo F triggering at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the peptide\u2019s binding area in the HR1 region is identical between NiV F and HeV F. a headless NG consisting of the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains (NG167) was sufficient to trigger NF to execute cell-cell fusion, suggesting that the G stalk triggers F (10. we created NG167 with an HeV head (NG167HG) or HG167 with an NiV head (HG167HG) by swapping functional domains. the resulting chimeras, NF488HF and HF488NF, were constructed with FLAG tags in their ectodomains. the resulting chimeras, NF488HF and HF488NF, were constructed with FLAG tags in their ectodomains. ephrinB2 binding was divided by CSE to account for differences in CSE between Gs. the indicated wild-type or chimeric NiV and HeV G proteins were expressed in HEK293Ts. lysates were then analyzed under reducing or nonreducing conditions. both the head- and stalk-containing domains of NG contribute to inducing the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the HF/NG combination. this result suggests that both the head- and stalk-containing domains of NG contribute to inducing the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the HF/NG combination. Pearson correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. HF with the TM/CT domain of NiV F (HF488NF) yielded a significantly hyperfusogenic phenotype when combined with either wild-type or chimeric G glycoproteins. wild-type HF induced hyperfusogenicity only in combination with wild-type NG. affinity purification was directed against either the HA tag in the attachment glycoprotein G or the FLAG tag in the fusion glycoprotein F. only F that directly associated with G (IP, -HA) or only G that directly associated with F (IP, -FLAG) was coimmunoprecipitated. binding avidities for all F-G interactions were normalized to the levels of NF/NG. binding avidities were normalized to the levels of NF/NG. lysates from cells transfected with F only served as controls. statistical analysis was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. we found that the strongly hypofusogenic NF/HG combination had a significantly higher binding avidity than the NF/NG combination (avidities, 2.83 and 1.00, respectively; P 0.0001) highly hyperfusogenic combination HF488NF/HG167NG yielded increased levels of viral entry. we used previously established BSL-2 pseudotyped viral entry assay. vseudotyped virus carrying NiV G but lacking F was used as a negative-control virus. the hyperfusogenic combination (HF488NF/HG167NG) showed 5- to 6-fold greater viral entry levels than the wild-type NF/NG combination. however, the hyperfusogenic HF/NG and hypofusogenic NF/HG (FIMean, 1.81) and hypofusogenic NF/HG (FIMean, 0.42) combinations showed viral entry levels similar to that of the NF/NG combination. cells were infected with serial dilutions of HNV/VSV-rLuc pseudotyped virions containing either WT (NF/NG) or chimeric G and F (HF488NF/HG167NG) or the heterotypic combinations NF/HG or HF/NG (A, right) cell-cell fusion is highly dependent on glycoprotein CSE. polyclonal antisera against NiV F have been previously used to detect F (i.e. rabbit 834) (9, 19), it is uncertain whether HeV and NiV Fs could be equally detected by these or any other antisera or monoclonal antibodies. a FLAG tag was inserted just N terminal to the cathepsin L cleavage site (Cat L) the results were normalized to NF (FLAG)-NG fusion. a one-way ANOVA statistical analysis was performed. the data represent averages SEM from at least five independent experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with F and G expression plasmids. fusion levels were determined 16 to 20 h posttransfection (hpt) by counting nuclei inside syncytia per field. fusion levels were determined by normalizing the fusion levels to that of the wild-type NiV fusion (FLAG NF and NG, set to 100%) levels were determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG and/or rabbit anti-HA antibodies (FCSE and/or GCSE), followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. the heterologous NF and HF (FCSE, 47.9% and 58.4%, respectively) and the heterologous NG and HG (GCSE, 88.9% and 90.1%, respectively) were expressed similarly on the cell surface (P > 0.05) for the NF/NG combination was set to 1.0; therefore, levels significantly greater than 1.0 would be considered hyperfusogenic and those significantly lower than 1.0 would be hypofusogenic fusion phenotypes. to determine statistical significance, we performed a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey pairwise multiple-comparison test. FIs were normalized to the FI of the NF/NG combination, set at 1.0 (dotted line) effector HEK293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and DSP2. hek293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and chimeric fusion. a t test comparing each combination to the NF/NG pair was performed. effector HEK293T cells were transfected with ephrinB2 and DSP2. HEK293T cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C to synchronize receptor binding. subsequently cells were allowed to undergo F triggering at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the peptide\u2019s binding area in the HR1 region is identical between NiV F and HeV F. a headless NG consisting of the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains (NG167) was sufficient to trigger NF to execute cell-cell fusion, suggesting that the G stalk triggers F (10). a headless NG consisting of the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains (NG167) was sufficient to trigger NF to execute cell-cell fusion, suggesting that the G stalk triggers F. the TM and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains in F are strongly conserved between the two viruses and have previously been implicated in viral budding. both the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains are important for membrane fusion as well as virus-like particle formation. differences in oligomerization patterns may affect cell surface expression levels and fusion (8, 46\u201348) wild-type NiV and HeV G and their chimeras displayed similar tetramer/dimer oligomerization ratios (one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey pairwise multiple-comparison test) both the head- and stalk-containing domains of NG contribute to inducing the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the HF/NG pair. this result suggests that both the head- and stalk-containing domains of NG contribute to inducing the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the HF/NG pair. HA was calculated to determine binding avidities for all F-G interactions. the fusion index scores from panel B are shown for each averaged value. the NiV F TM/CT domain can enhance the fusogenicity of HF. coimmunoprecipitation was directed against either the HA tag in the attachment glycoprotein G or the FLAG tag in the fusion glycoprotein F. only F that directly associated with G (IP, -HA) or only G that directly associated with F (IP, -FLAG) was coimmunoprecipitated. performing F pulldown experiments (IP, -FLAG) to determine the avidity of F-G interactions. we then determined binding avidities for all F-G interactions as GIP/(GLys FIP) to account for differences in G or F expression or pulldown efficiencies. the obtained values were used to determine binding avidities for all G and F combinations. binding avidities were normalized to the levels of NF/NG, set as 1.00. the data represent averages SEM from at least three independent experiments. the mechanism of viral entry (virus-cell membrane fusion) is generally closely related to the mechanism of cell-cell membrane fusion (49), although the two processes do not always correlate (10, 50), so we asked whether the highly hyperfusogenic combination HF488NF/HG167NG would yield increased levels of viral entry. HF488NF/HG167NG and HF488NF/HG167NG combinations were much lower than those of the NF/HG, HF/NG, and HF/HG combinations. however, the hyperfusogenic combination (HF488NF/HG167NG) showed 5- to 6-fold greater viral entry levels than the wild-type NF/NG combination. HF488NF/HG167NG protein pair is enhanced compared to that of the NF/NG combination. vero cells were infected with serial dilutions of HNV/VSV-rLuc pseudotyped virions containing either WT (NF/NG) or chimeric G and F (HF/HG) or the heterotypic combinations NF/HG or HF/NG (A, right) homologous HeV glycoproteins fused relatively more efficiently than the NiV glycoproteins using a vaccinia T7 expression system (36). bossart et al. speculated that the fusion potency correlates with the fusogenicity of the F protein. but that study did not quantify the glycoprotein CSE levels. we found that the HeV G glycoprotein is less fusogenic in homo- and heterotypic F glycoprotein combinations than NiV G. heterotypic fusion was highly increased or decreased depending on the viral origin of the glycoproteins. both cell-cell fusion and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HeV and NiV glycoproteins are able to efficiently interact structurally and functionally. syncytium levels were likely a result of membrane fusion steps prior to or coincident with F triggering. the hypofusogenic NF/HG combination appeared to show slightly lower G and F CSE levels than the homotypic NF/NG combination. it is unclear whether the relative intracellular retention observed is due to the stronger NF-HG interactions within the cell prior to cell surface transport. residues 1 to 167) or head (residues 168 to 604) domain between HeV and NiV G. the CT/TM/stalk domain of HeV G is a main determinant of the hypofusogenic NF/HG phenotype. this may be attributed to a stronger binding avidity of the HG CT/TM/stalk domain to NF. we created chimeras by exchanging the TM/CT domains between the HeV and NiV F glycoproteins. the viral origin of the F head domain dominantly determined the membrane fusion phenotypes. the NiV F TM/CT domain was able to enhance the ability of HeV F to induce cell-cell fusion. the relationship between cell-cell fusion activity and viral pathogenicity remains complex and remains understudied. henipaviral vaccines using the matrix (M) and the F and G glycoproteins recently have been shown to protect against NiV disease in a hamster model (3). the removal of the glycine did not affect the fusogenic capacities of NiV G. G proteins had a C-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and F proteins had a C-terminal AU1 tag (DTYRYI), as previously described (8). where indicated, F proteins with an internal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDDDK) were constructed and utilized. to construct the G chimeras, we used NG167HG_F/HG167NG_F (5\u2032-GCAAGTTCACCCTGCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC six-well plates of HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant G and/or F expression plasmids. cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and syncytial nuclei (4 or more nuclei per cell) were counted in each microscopic field. cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS) and incubated with fluorescently labeled anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies for 45 min at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed, fixed, and analyzed as described above.
