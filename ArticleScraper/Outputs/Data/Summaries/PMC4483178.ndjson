{"summary": "intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) is the most widely used circulatory assistance method for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) it can increase myocardial and peripheral perfusion and reduce afterload and then improve cardiac output. it is also used in patients being weaned from a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the national health research institutes in Taiwan obtained informed consent. an exemption was obtained from the institutional review board of Chi Mei Medical Center. the details of the NHIRD have been described in hundreds of published papers. mortality was defined as the number of patients treated with IABP who died before being discharged from the hospital. in-hospital mortality was defined as the number of patients treated with IABP who died before being discharged from the hospital. RD consists of detailed healthcare claims data from more than 23 million enrollees, more than 99% of Taiwan\u2019s population. in-hospital mortality was defined as the number of patients treated with IABP who died before being discharged from the hospital. the cochran-Armitage trend test was used to test the association of trends in proportions over specific periods. the log-rank test was used for the comparisons between genders and different age groups. 65.22 12.74 66.39 13.99 65.04 12.52 0.0007 Age [n (%)] 35 224 (2.25) 39 (2.83) 185 (2.16) 0.0001 35\u201350 949 (9.54) 146 (10.60) 803 (9.36) 50\u201365 3056 (30.71) 323 (33.46) 2733 (31.87) 65\u201380 4870 (48.93) 697 (50.62) 4173 (48.66) 80 853 (8.57) 172 (12 baseline clinical history of patients treated with IABP showed HTN (n = 2696; 27.09%), DM (n = 2381; 23.92%), prior MI (n = 1538; 15.45%), prior CVA (n = 706; 7.09%), prior heart failure (n = 1904; 19.13%), prior CABG (n = 92; 0.92%) surgery, and prior PCI (n = 22; 0.22%) IABP use in Taiwan has been increasing annually since 1998. in-hospital mortality rate per IABP has been decreasing annually since 1999. in-hospital mortality rate of patients treated with IABP in a particular year fell from 10.49% in 1999 to 7.25% in 2008. trends of in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients treated with IABP combined with coronary revascularization, 1998\u20132008. mortality rate was calculated by dividing [the number of patients who underwent PCI or CABG and died in a particular year] by [the total number of patients who underwent PCI or CABG and were treated with IABP in that particular year]. mortality in patients who had been treated with IABP and PCI for 1 vessel, 2 vessels, or 3 vessels in the same admission was not significantly different. the mortality in patients who had been treated with PCI-only plus IABP was 15.45%. patients with acute myocarditis who were being treated with IABP had the highest mortality rate: 26.47%. in-hospital mortality of patients with ACS was 15.14%. in-hospital mortality of patients with ACS was 15.14%, and of patients with CS was 22.14%. women had a greater risk for major complications from IABP. in-hospital mortality in patients 35 years old treated with IABP was the second highest. there is no consensus on the timing of removing intra-aortic balloon pumps. ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes showed that IABP was most frequently used in patients with CAD. most patients (n = 7635/9952, 76.7%) had been treated with IABP and CABG during the same admission. most patients required IABP to be weaned from a CPB, not to treat CS. 8% in-hospital mortality rate in patients with AMI comorbid with CS was much lower than in other studies. emergency revascularization using PCI or CABG is done in Taiwan for most patients with STEMI and comorbid CS. all the diagnoses were based on the ICD-9-CM codes, not patients\u2019 medical charts or personal observation by the authors. the IABP-related complications, such as vascular and septic complications, are not inferable from claims records."}
