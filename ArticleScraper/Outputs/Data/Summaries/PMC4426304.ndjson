{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection triggers host immune responses by increasing the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. these chemokines are one of the major coordinators that regulate the immune response during HIV-1 pathogenesis. they either participate in host defense or contribute toward disease progression. HIV-1 invades the CNS during the early phase of infection through migrating perivascular monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. this upregulation of cytokines and chemokines by the virus and viral proteins is mediated by signaling molecules. HIV-1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 increases expression of cytokines and chemokines in multiple cell types. gp120 activates c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38. also, chemokines CCL2 and MIP-1 stimulates the production of CCL5 in astrocytes. phosphorylation of MAPK kinases results in infiltration of neutrophil into tissue compartments. human recombinant IL-1 and neutralizing antibody against IL-1 were purchased from millipore. ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK inhibitors were purchased from Abcam. 3 mL of Histopaque 1077 was layered on 3 mL of histopaque 1119. 6 mL blood was layered on top of the Histopaque layers. the tube was centrifuged at 890 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. supernatants were collected, spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and filtered through a 0.22 m filter to remove cellular debris. differentiated (7\u20138 day old) MDMs were either infected with HIV-1 at a multiplicity of infection. the cDNA product was used to perform gene expression array using a Taqman 7900HT machine. data were normalized with endogenous controls (included in the array) and differential regulation of proinflammatory chemokines (fold change) was analyzed from the Ct values. treatment of neuronal cell lines and primary neurons and apoptosis analyses Briefly, primary neurons (3104 cells/well) as well as NT2 and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to HIV-1- or mock-infected MDM supernatants. to detect neuronal apoptosis, cells were washed twice with 1PBS and were stained with the JC-1 staining solution. supernatants were harvested at 48\u201372 h postinfection. chemotaxis assay was used to monitor migration of neutrophils. blots were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. the immunoblotting images were quantified using the ImageJ software. for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) data analyses the SABiosciences web-based software was used. 3 mL of Histopaque 1077 was layered on 3 mL of histopaque 1119. 6 mL blood was layered on top of the Histopaque layers. the tube was centrifuged at 890 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C. supernatants collected, spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and filtered through 0.22 m filter to remove cellular debris. differentiated (7\u20138 day old) MDMs were either infected with HIV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. the cDNA product was used to perform gene expression array using a Taqman 7900HT machine. data were normalized with endogenous controls and differential regulation of proinflammatory chemokines (fold change) was analyzed from the Ct values from day 0 to 20 using the SABiosciences web-based tools. reporter activity was measured 3 h posttreatment as suggested by the manufacturer. primary neurons (3104 cells/well) as well as NT2 and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to HIV-1- or mock-infected MDM supernatants. s were pretreated with 5 g of anti-CXCL5 for 2 h followed by HIV-1 or mock infection. anti-CXCL5 was maintained during the infection period. s were harvested at 48\u201372 h postinfection and used for chemotaxis assay. the data were analyzed using Student's t-test for normally distributed data with equal variances and P0.05 was considered as significant. the data were quantified using the imageJ software. most significant chemokine exhibiting 57.6-fold increase over control with the significance of P=0.022. we focused the rest of this study to delineate the expression pattern of CXCL5, its regulation and its functional consequences in HIV-1 pathogenesis. 13.4445 \u2014 \u2014 2.903 4.7709 2.1719 CCL20 51.4957 12.3806 3.4045 \u2014 3.2644 \u2014 3.0303 2.3544 CCL21 \u2014 \u2014 2.2504 \u2014 3.405 \u2014 \u2014 CCL23 6.921 10.0733 2.1044 4.1452 2.8435 4.8126 \u2014 5.4594 CCL24 2.2726 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2.7078 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 HIV-1-infected and mock-infected MDMs were assessed by qRT-PCR. positive values indicate upregulation and negative values downregulation of inflammatory chemokine genes in HIV-1-infected MDMs compared with mock. concentration of secreted CXCL5 increased drastically in HIV-1-infected MDMs. compared with mock-infected culture supernatants, the fold change ranged from 3- to 9-fold higher in infected culture supernatants. HIV-1 regulates the expression of CXCL5 through IL-1 in infected MDMs. IL-1 triggers the expression of CXCL5 through IL-1 in different cell types. mRNA transcript analyses indicate that IL-1 and CXCL5 have parallel expression pattern. supernatants were harvested at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h postinfection. hek293T cells were treated with 1, 10, or 20 ng of recombinant human interleukin-1 or MDM supernatants from HIV-1-infected and mock-infected cultures. reporter activity measured posttreatment exhibited a dose-dependent increase in CXCL5 promoter activity by rhIL-1 stimulation compared with no stimulation. a significantly higher level of luciferase gene expression was also observed in these cells treated with HIV-1-infected MDM supernatants compared with mock-infected supernatants. was assessed in HIV-1-exposed/infected and control MDM cell lysates. results indicate a significant increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 within 30 min postexposure in HIV-1-treated MDMs compared with mock-treated culture. but SAPK/JNK showed no significant difference between these groups. MDMs treated with vehicle (DMSO) were considered negative control. increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 is associated with upregulation of CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected MDMs. a chemotaxis assay was performed with a CXCR2 (receptor for CXCL5 ligand)-expressing cell line (L1.2 cells) as well as primary neutrophils using HIV-1-infected or mock-infected MDM supernatants. at a concentration of 1 nM rhCXCL5, the number of migrated L1.2 cells was 12 times higher compared with mock. however, at 10 nM there was no additional blocking of CXCL5 reduced neutrophil migration by 30% in control MDM supernatants. reduction was 65% in HIV-1-positive MDM culture supernatants (P=0.0161) results indicate that CXCL5 plays a major role in recruitment of neutrophils. neuronal cell lines NT2, SH-SY5Y, and NP cells were treated with HIV-1- or mock-infected MDM supernatants. cell death in neuronal cells exposed to control MDM supernatant ranged between 8% to 13% in NT2 and SH-SY5Y cells and 17% in primary neurons. blocking of CXCL5 did not have any significant effect on neuronal survival. induced differential regulation of chemokines in MDMs role in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis. normal donor-derived MDMs were infected with HIV-1 at an MOI of 0.1 or mock infected. compared with mock-infected controls, HIV-1-infected MDMs expressed a number of chemokines at different time points postinfection. in HIV-1-infected MDMs Compared with Mock-Infected Control Cell Gene symbol Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 8 Day 12 Day 16 Day 20 CCL1 47.1821 16.3458 \u2014 \u2014 4.4766 \u2014 3.932 \u2014 CCL2 4.8856 3.3757 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3.1553 \u2014 2.1894 CCL3 4.5349 2.3376 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2.4965 2.8851 CCL \u2014 \u2014 2.7078 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 positive values indicate upregulation and negative values downregulation of inflammatory chemokine genes in HIV-1-infected MDMs compared with mock. qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, quantitative real-time PCR. Combined analysis (n=6) showed significant increase of CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected MDMs over mock-infected MDMs. together, the results indicate that HIV-1 infection increases the level of CXCL5 both at the mRNA and protein level in MDMs. expression of IL-1 and CXCL5 is induced, in part, by IL-1. infected MDMs were infected with either HIV-1 at an MOI of 0.1 or mock. cells and supernatants were harvested at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days postinfection. transfected cells treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were used as negative (vehicle) control. reporter activity was measured as relative light unit (RLU) 3 h posttreatment. reporter activity measured posttreatment exhibited a dose-dependent increase in CXCL5 promoter activity by rhIL-1 stimulation compared with no stimulation. the fold increase was 1.4, 1.7, and 3.7 for 1, 10, and 20 ng of IL-1 treatment with the significance of 0.0042, 0.0037, and 0.0021. a significantly (P=0.0145) higher level of luciferase gene expression was also observed in these cells treated with HIV-1-infected SAPK/JNK showed no significant difference between these groups. the specificity and involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in HIV-1-induced CXCL5 production is regulated by ERK1/2 signaling in MDMs. cells were harvested 30 min posttreatment. ation of ERK1/2 and p38 is associated with the upregulation of CXCL5 in HIV-1-infected MDMs. MDMs were treated with SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), and SP600125 (SAPK/JNK inhibitor) before infection with HIV-1. blocking ERK1/2 pathway with PD98059 showed significant reduction. a chemotaxis assay was performed with a recombinant CXCL5 (receptor for CXCL5 ligand)-expressing cell line (L1.2 cells) as well as primary neutrophils using HIV-1-infected MDM supernatants. natants (P=0.0161) indicate that CXCL5 plays a major role in recruitment of neutrophils and cells expressing CXCR2 receptor. transmigration of L1.2 cells in response to HIV-1 or mock-infected MDM supernatants was assessed by chemotaxis assay. cell death in neuronal cells exposed to control MDM supernatant ranged between 8% to 13% in NT2 and SH-SY5Y cells and 17% in primary neurons. cell death increased to 21%\u201325% in case of NT2 and SH-SY5Y and 37% in primary neurons. blocking of CXCL5 did not have any significant effect on neuronal survival. infection both in vitro and in vivo as well as by other viruses. association of CXCL1 and CXCL5 in the west Nile Virus induced encephalitis through IL-22 was reported. IL-1 is known to be regulated by HIV-1 as part of the proinflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and immune activation are hallmarks of HIV-1-associated diseases. inflammatory response in infected individuals remains high, suggesting an interaction between HIV-1 particles and signaling molecules. this interaction could potentially alter signaling events that trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ERK1/2 is related to CXCL5 production is not established. it is possible to predict that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 could phosphorylate or translocate transcription factors and/or IL-1 that could potentially bind and transactivate the CXCL5 promoter. CXCL5 primarily contributes to the movement of neutrophils or CXCR2-positive cells. it is possible to predict that the virus may have a role in infiltration of other cell types. hyperactivation of neutrophils in HIV-1-infected patients is associated with deregulation of the apoptosis/necrosis equilibrium.
