{"summary": "Background Nucleolar localization sequences (NoLSs) are short targeting sequences responsible for the localization of proteins to the nucleolus. the nucleolus is a sub-nuclear cellular compartment accessible to a large number of proteins since it is not surrounded by a membrane. the most well-characterized function of the nucleolus is the biogenesis of ribosomes. many proteins have been found to localize cyclically or conditionally to the nucleolus. many of these sequences can localize non-nucleolar reporter proteins to the nucleolus when fused to them. despite this, numerous disparate reports of short nucleolar targeting sequences have been published over the past 20 years. the current implementation of NoD uses a local version of Batchman from the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator [12] and the human-trained NoLS prediction model developed previously [10] to provide the prediction for each encoded subsequence. the prediction is displayed as shown in Figure 1 if at least one NoLS is predicted in the input protein. clinod produces the same results as a web server but is more suitable for processing of multiple sequences. for better integration with other bioinformatics tools, many more output options are supported. for example, the input sequences can be cleaned (stripped of ambiguous characters) a virtual appliance version of NoD offers the same functionality as our public server, with the exception of JPred predictions. the virtual appliance version of NoD offers the same functionality as our public server. the current implementation of NoD uses a local version of Batchman from the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator [12] and the human-trained NoLS prediction model developed previously [10] to provide the prediction for each encoded subsequence. the prediction is displayed as shown in Figure 1 if at least one NoLS is predicted in the input protein. the user is provided with the option of also running JPred secondary structure predictions [11] to include as input to the NoLS neural network. clinod produces the same results as a web server but is more suitable for processing of multiple sequences.
