{"summary": "PED is an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease in nursing pigs. it is caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) it is characterized by vomiting and lethal watery diarrhea. it is a global problem, especially in many swine-producing countries. the ability to propagate the virus is critical for the diagnosis and molecular analysis of PEDV. the ability to propagate the virus is critical for the development of inactivated or attenuated vaccine. the characteristics of PEDV cultured in this cell line have not been reported. a virulence experiment for IEC-adapted NJ also confirmed that the virus had a tendency towards attenuation at 45 passages. the virus isolated from samples was identified as PEDV by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) the small intestine tissue was homogenized with serum-free DMEM. the supernatant was filtered using 0.22-m pore-size cellulose acetate. the PCR purified products were cloned into pMD-19T vector. the PCR purified products were cloned into pMD-19T vector. a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing CPE by the Reed\u2013Muench method. virions were resuspended in 100 L of DMEM and observed by transmission electron microscopy (H-7650, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) were incubated as first and second antibodies, respectively, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) the coverslips were mounted on microscope glass slides in mounting buffer and cell staining was examined. the S gene sequences of PEDV strain NJ and the sequences of 33 known PEDV strains (listed in Table 1) were subjected to comparative analysis. in vivo swine studies were performed in a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory. PEDV-negative piglets as confirmed by RT-PCR method were neonatal landraces obtained from a pig farm without a PED outbreak or vaccination with PEDV vaccine. the piglets were divided into three groups. fetal bovine serum (Gibco) isolated from samples was identified as PEDV. the small intestine tissue was homogenized with serum-free DMEM. the supernatant was filtered using 0.22-m pore-size cellulose acetate. the PCR purified products were cloned into pMD-19T vector. the confluent cell monolayer was washed once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and incubated with 1 mL of inoculum for 1 h in a T25 flask supplemented with 21 g/mL of trypsin (Gibco) titer was measured in 96-well plates by 10-fold serial dilution of samples at five-passage intervals. the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing CPE by the Reed\u2013Muench method. mouse anti-PEDV S protein monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) were incubated as first and second antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Beyotime, China) the coverslips were mounted on microscope glass slides in mounting buffer. representative PEDV isolates, phylogenetic analysis of the parent NJ strain was performed by the neighbor-joining method using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software. bootstrap values were estimated for 1000 replicates. reference strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) used in this study. the pathogenicity of the lower and higher generations of NJ should be compared. PEDV-negative piglets as confirmed by RT-PCR method were neonatal landraces obtained from a pig farm without a PED outbreak or vaccination with PEDV vaccine. vero cell cultures were negative for the M gene after two passages. visible CPEs were observed at each passage. compared with uninfected IECs, the PEDV-infected IECs were characterized by cell fusion. titers of PEDV strain NJ propagated in IECs post-serial passages. all the results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. the virion was circular in shape and 80\u2013120 nm in diameter. Detection of PEDV strain NJ in IECs by immunofluorescence assay at 24 h post-infection. mouse anti-PEDV S protein monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) were respectively used as primary and secondary antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. serial passaging to evaluate the amino acid variability of the IEC-adapted PEDV strain NJ during serial passagings. the sequences of the S gene of the parent NJ and those of the virus at the 15th, 30th and 45th passage were amplified by RT-PCR. these amino acid sequences were then compared with the corresponding S protein sequences of the classical PEDV CV777 and its vaccine strain. all piglets infected with 5th passage cultures and three (3/8) piglets infected with 45th passage cultures showed diarrheic feces, significantly emaciated body condition, and severe watery diarrhea with vomiting. abundant yellow, watery, and foul-smelling stools were also observed around the perianal region of the piglets infected with 45th passage virus. however, in the control group, the piglets were healthy without watery diarrhea a severe outbreak of acute diarrhea had been reported in sucking piglets. the genome RNA of the serially propagated virus was extracted and identified by RT-PCR. the viral titer of the PEDV strain NJ propagated in IECs. the viral titer reached 104.5 TCID50/0.1 mL at passage 45. the virion was circular in shape and 80\u2013120 nm in diameter. PEDV strain NJ and cell nuclei were detected using mouse anti-PEDV S protein monoclonal antibody and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. green signals were observed in the PEDV strain NJ-infected IECs, but not in mock-infected IECs. these results suggest that the Chinese southern epidemic PEDV strains were likely derived from the same source. we did not find any insertions and deletions in the S gene compared with the Chinese PEDV S gene recombinant variants like IA1, IA2 and MN identified in U.S. Figure 5. Phylogenetic analysis of PEDV strain NJ based on the S gene. the clinical signs and survival percentage of the piglets was monitored daily over a 10-day observation period. all piglets infected with 5th passage cultures and three (3/8) piglets infected with 45th passage cultures showed diarrheic feces, significantly emaciated body condition, and severe watery diarrhea with vomiting. however, in the control group, the piglets were healthy without watery diarrhea. the intestinal tracts of infected piglets were thin and transparent. mesenteric congestion, and the small intestinal wall was thin and transparent. the viral antigen was predominantly present in the small intestines. pigs infected with IEC-adapted NJ at 45th passage. the adaptability of PEDV isolate infected with cell lines was the first step to successful isolation in vitro. we successfully isolated and propagated the epidemic PEDV strain using porcine intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. this is the first report on the characteristics of PEDV cultured in this cell line which was established by Wang et al. the PEDV strain NJ was detected in cell culture during serial passages, by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence assay. the sensitivity of IECs, the trypsin concentration used in IEC culture was lower than that used in Vero cells during PEDV absorption. the titer of the IEC-adapted strain NJ propagated in IECs increased gradually and reached 104.5 TCID50/0.1 mL at 45 passages. ated strains have been extensively studied [40,41]. to investigate the genetic variability of the S protein of the PEDV strain NJ, the S gene was amplified during various serial passages and analyzed. compared with the parent strain, four mutations in the S protein occurred after the 15th passage, and another seven mutations occurred after the 30th passage. we successfully isolated and identified a novel PEDV strain NJ from clinical samples using IECs. this is the first report to describe the isolation and characterization of the IEC-adapted strain NJ."}
