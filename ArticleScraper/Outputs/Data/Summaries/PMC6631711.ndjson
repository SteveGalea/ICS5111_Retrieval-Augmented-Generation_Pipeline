{"summary": "ZIKV is a human pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes. the virus also induces a wide range of symptoms that go from fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle pain, and conjunctivitis to severe ocular lesions. there is no specific antiviral therapy licensed for the treatment of ZIKV infection. the knowledge on virus-host interactions has exponentially grown. it is expected that the detailed knowledge of the metabolic alterations during ZIKV and other arboviral infections could help design novel therapeutics. it is also expected that the detailed knowledge of the metabolic alterations during ZIKV. the interactions of viral proteins with lipids are important to complete different aspects of the ZIKV life-cycle. the interactions of viral proteins with lipids are important to complete different aspects of the ZIKV life-cycle, remarking the relevance of lipids during infection. the involvement of lipids in flavivirus biology begins at the step of virion morphogenesis. the lipid envelope of ZIKV is hijacked from the membrane of the endoplasmic Reticulum. replication is associated with a marked rearrangement of the cytoplasmic membranes. NS1 (a major host-interaction protein that functions in flaviviral replication, pathogenesis, and immune evasion) also associate to cellular membranes, despite lack of transmembrane domain. lipids in other cellular structures (peroxisomes and lipid droplets) have also been related to ZIKV infection. it has been documented that the capsid (C) protein of the ZIKV localized to lipid droplets [32,35] and that this association can be abolished by specific amino acid substitution in the C protein [36]. it could be important for virion biogenesis as described for DENV [37] several structurally-unrelated inhibitors of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins pathway reduces ZIKV-infection in cultured cells. these compounds, namely nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), its methylated derivative tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid (M4N), PF-429242, and fatostatin (Table 1) could constitute lead compounds for the development of antiviral therapies against ZIK a series of small-molecule inhibitors (PF-05175157, PF-05206574 and PF-06256254, Table 1) of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) support the role of lipid metabolism and specifically fatty acid synthesis in ZIKV, DENV, and WNV infection. one of these inhibitors, PF-05175157, has undergone clinical trials in healthy volunteers (NCT01433380), and for sphingolipids, and specifically sphingomyelin, play important roles in cellular physiology and disease [65], and have been associated with diverse steps of flavivirus infection both in vitro and in vivo using animal models [17,66,67,68]. cholesterol is involved in key steps, such as entry and membrane fusion, innate immunity, or virion biogenesis. the importance of cholesterol for ZIKV infection can be extended to its mosquito vectors. the insect parasite bacteria Wolbachia modulates host-cell lipids [70] and disrupts cholesterol and vesicular trafficking, blocking the DENV and ZIKV life cycle. lipid envelope antiviral disruption appears as a complementary antiviral strategy to inhibit ZIKV. the small molecule CLR01 [62] or an amphipathic -helical peptide also disrupt the virion envelope and reduce ZIKV-infectivity. several structurally-unrelated inhibitors of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins pathway reduces ZIKV-infection in cultured cells. these compounds, namely nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), its methylated derivative tetra-O-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid (M4N), PF-429242, and fatostatin, could constitute lead compounds for the development of antiviral therapies against ZIKV PF-05175157, PF-05206574 and PF-06256254, respectively, has undergone clinical trials in healthy volunteers. one of these inhibitors, PF-05175157, was tested against WNV in mouse models. AMPK inhibits ACC enzymatic activity by phosphorylation at serine 79. ACC inhibitors PF-05175157 [54] PF-05206574 [54] PF-06256254 [54] Benzamil [22] Imipramine [57] Cholesterol derivatives 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) [58,59] 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) [43] Lipopeptide antibiotic Daptomycin [60] Lipid envelope disruptors Extract from Aphloi the importance of cholesterol for a ZIKV infection can be extended to its mosquito vectors. for example, the insect parasite bacteria Wolbachia modulates host-cell lipids [70] and disrupts cholesterol and vesicular trafficking, blocking the DENV and ZIKV life cycle [71,72,73] anti-ZIKV activity in neurons is 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC, Table 1). the proposed mechanism of inhibition of ZIKV infection is likely related to the induction of cellular autophagy by this compound. lipid metabolism is actually a first order pharmaceutical target for the treatment of human diseases. both AMPK and SREBP currently constitute important pharmacological targets for human diseases (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and cancers) most of the drugs targeting lipid metabolism here reviewed are effective against more than one flavivirus. repositioning drugs that target lipid metabolism as antiviral candidates could lead to more affordable broad-spectrum compounds. effective antiviral treatments lowering the viral load should be useful to prevent ZIKV transmission by diminishing mosquito infection during blood-feeding. yet to be completed before the implementation of these antiviral strategies in clinical practice, the current scenario and their potential benefits support future research efforts aimed to repositioning of lipid metabolism modulators as antiviral compounds."}
