{"summary": "mRNA and mRNA vaccines have generated significant interest and efforts because of their potential as platform technologies. both can be quickly made with fairly generic manufacturing processes and can be constructed directly from the genetic sequence of the desired protein, whether the origin of the protein is human or from a pathogen. a gene construct coding for the antigen instead of inactivating the pathogen is vastly easier, more rapid, and avoids potential risks of working with live pathogens. in 1990, Felgner and colleagues demonstrated that plasmid DNA could be directly injected into muscle with resultant expression of the encoded protein by myocytes. the observation was important because up until then, significant effort had been devoted to formulations to deliver DNA in vivo. the same 1990 publication also demonstrated that naked RNA could similarly result in the in vivo expression of encoded protein. a key issue was how to optimally deliver the DNA plasmid or the mRNA into the desired cells. for gene therapy, the encoded protein needs to not stimulate an immune response against the protein if it were an antigen. the type of cell producing the protein (and hence the cell type transduced by the plasmid DNA) is relevant. two developments were important for changing the perception and reality of mRNA. these were the demonstration by weissman and Kariko that the use of modified nucleosides made in vitro-transcribed mRNA less immunogenic [16] further work explored the use of other nucleosides, such as substituting 5-methylcytidine for cytidine with further improvement. only one out of 10,000 molecules of mRNA will escape an endosome into the cytoplasm [5]. the amplification by translation of the mRNA into protein has to overcome losses and the inefficiencies of degradation and the transduction process. plasmid DNA is more stable than mRNA, and each molecule results in the production of multiple mRNA molecules. plasmid DNA has been shown to persist in muscle up to six months in a non-integrated fashion. the ability to make either a plasmid DNA or an mRNA construct quickly by simply knowing the genetic sequence of a desired antigen makes plasmid DNA or mRNA much faster technologies (compared to current approaches) to produce a vaccine, if needed, for an epidemic or an emerging disease. the advent of recombinant proteins provided a simpler way of making vaccine antigens. however, this still had drawbacks, such as ensuring that the antigen had any crucial antigenically correct post-translational modifications. mRNA is made by in vitro transcription starting from a linearized DNA template, performing in vitro transcription, then getting rid of the template by digestion with DNAses. stability of mRNA as a vialed product is a separate consideration from the stability in vivo. rabies mRNA vaccine was still effective for pre-clinical protection after several months at temperatures ranging from 80 \u00b0C to as high as +70 \u00b0C. the most direct way to ensure delivery of the gene encoding an antigen to a professional APC is to transfect the cells in vitro prior to administering the transfected cells back to the patient. the largest number of mRNA clinical trials currently underway involve transfection of cells with mRNA encoding tumor antigens followed by re-infusion of the transfected cells into the patient. plasmid DNA and mRNA are being developed for indications other than vaccines. both entities are anionic due to the negative charges of the phosphate groups. both entities are anionic due to the negative charges of the phosphate groups, and various formulations have utilized polycations. initial work by Felgner showed that expression of protein encoded by plasmid DNA was highest in muscle following intramuscular injection versus expression in other tissues after intravenous injection. immune responses were highest with direct i.m. syringe injection of naked plasmid DNA rather than via intravenous (i.v.), intradermal (i.d.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injections. certain formulations, such as delivery of a particular encapsulated lipoplex mRNA vaccine, were found to specifically take up mRNA by endocytosis. delivery devices such as the gene gun (where mRNA is put onto gold particles) and electroporation are also being explored. self-amplifying systems for both mRNA and DNA Vaccines Significant efforts have been expended to take advantage of a system employed by certain viruses. these constructs encode viral proteins that result in the transduced cell producing many copies of mRNA encoding the protein of interest (i.e., the antigen) without making a whole viral particle. thus, significantly more mRNA encoding the antigen and hence antigen protein, are made. in pre-clinical models, this has resulted in increased potency for these vectors on a per molecule of vector basis. the reason for the increased efficacy may be more than simply the increased amount of antigen produced. dsRNA intermediaries result in increased production of interferon and subsequently other immunologic effects. plasmid DNA also acts on the TBK1-STING pathway through cytosolic receptors. this results in the generation of type 1 interferons, which act as adjuvants for the generation of immune responses against the antigen(s) encoded by the plasmid DNA vaccine. mRNA acts via multiple pathways, including the innate system. possible utility of RNA-induced inflammation for vaccines is demonstrated by the fact that one of the first uses of RNA for vaccines was to include non-coding RNA in human clinical trials as an adjuvant for a rabies vaccine. the continued evaluation of non-coding RNA as an adjuvant is ongoing in clinical testing for various cancers without the provision of an antigen. clinical adverse effects include myopathy, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, lipodystrophy, liver steatosis, and nerve damage. some toxicity has been reported for mRNA pre-clinically along with limited human adverse events. some toxicity has been reported for mRNA pre-clinically along with limited human adverse events. both mRNA and mRNA vaccines are thought of as simply an expression system for the desired protein, but neither is immunologically inert. both DNA vectors and in vitro transcribed mRNA activate the innate immune system via their CpG motifs, which stimulate TLR9. the double-stranded structure of the DNA plasmid is thought to be an immune stimulant [48] through non-TLR mechanisms. plasmid DNA also acts on the TBK1-STING pathway through cytosolic receptors. this results in the generation of type 1 interferons, which then act as adjuvants for the generation of immune responses against the antigen(s) encoded by the plasmid DNA vaccine. possible utility of RNA-induced inflammation for vaccines is demonstrated by the fact that one of the first uses of RNA for vaccines was to include non-coding RNA in human clinical trials as an adjuvant for a rabies vaccine. the continued evaluation of non-coding RNA as an adjuvant is ongoing in clinical testing for various cancers without the provision of an antigen. toxicities of mRNA seen with antivirals and anti-cancer drugs. clinical adverse effects include myopathy, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, lipodystrophy, liver steatosis, and nerve damage. some toxicity reported for mRNA pre-clinically along with limited human adverse events. mRNA rabies vaccine may reflect the inflammatory nature of the mRNA. results highlight potential toxicity downside of the inflammatory activity of mRNA vaccines, adverse effects not seen to this extent with plasmid DNA. this would likely require repeat administration of mRNA, which might increase the potential for toxicities. a proposed mechanism for possible autoimmune responses is via the induction of type I interferon [63], which may result in both inflammation and possibly autoimmune responses [64]. this includes work showing that the responses seen in mice were similar to those seen in humans for an influenza mRNA vaccine construct via TLR7 and TLR8 in humans. five plasmid DNA products (four of them vaccines) have received licensure for veterinary applications. these include a fish vaccine for infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus licensed in 2005, and a vaccine against salmon pancreas disease licensed in 2016. a dog cancer immunotherapeutic vaccine for melanoma was licensed originally based upon comparison with historic controls in the us in 2010. s are not very good at inducing antibodies, yet this DNA vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies of sufficient titer for protection and licensure in horses. the lack of potency of DNA vaccines in human trials was considered to reflect the size of humans compared to the usual small pre-clinical animal models. plasmid DNA as a prime followed by a heterologous boost has resulted in significant potency for the generation of immune responses, including CTLs. phase II studies for the treatment of two autoimmune diseases, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, yielded encouraging clinical responses. however, clinical trials of DNA vaccines for cancer utilizing electroporation have provided encouraging results. 78% of each group had \"solicited systemic adverse events\" including ten patients (10% of all injected patients) with grade three adverse events. a second construct for rabies is now in clinical testing. no publications found NCT03392389 mRNA-1388 Moderna/DARPA Chikungunya Not Disclosed (ND) ND 1 Active, Not Recruiting Primary Completion: March 2019; no results

Monoclonal antibody prophylaxis for In jjar (the company has published relatively little in the peer-reviewed scientific literature related to their clinical trials) a clinical trial has been initiated with mRNA encoding a monoclonal antibody antibody for use in prevention of Chikungunya virus infection. mRNA as an adjuvant is listed. a number of trials for cancer utilize mRNA for ex vivo transfection of dendritic cells that are then re-infused into the patient. five plasmid DNA products (four of them vaccines) have received licensure for veterinary applications. the licensure and immunogenicity of the equine WNV vaccine are significant for human DNA vaccine efforts. the lack of potency of DNA vaccines in humans was considered to reflect the size of humans compared to the usual small pre-clinical animal models. the ease of making both DNA and mRNA vaccines is considered a tremendous advantage for rapid responses to emergent or epidemic diseases. a variety of clinical trials for several other diseases, such as HIV, plasmid DNA as a prime followed by a heterologous boost has resulted in significant potency for the generation of immune responses. a dog cancer immunotherapeutic vaccine for melanoma was licensed based on comparison with historic controls in the us in 2010. a vaccine for west Nile virus (WNV) prevention in horses was licensed in 2005 [74], although it is no longer used in favor of the previously licensed killed virus vaccine for unpublished reasons. a human clinical trial of a equine WNV DNA vaccine in humans showed that all subjects generated antibodies that were considered protective in the horses. in a subsequent study using a construct with a stronger promoter, older adults had neutralizing antibody responses as good as the younger adults. this suggests that it is not a limitation of the technology per se to generate effective antibodies, but rather the target and the optimized constructs are key elements. clinical trials of DNA vaccines for cancer have provided encouraging clinical responses, including for CIN3 and CIN2/3. other clinical trials of DNA vaccines for cancer have included using DNA that encoded fusion proteins including a tumor CTL epitope(s) and a T helper stimulator. clinical trials for mRNA prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases are now in clinical testing. none 1 active, not

RNA as an Adjuvant Trials utilizing non-coding RNA as an adjuvant are listed. studies include using non-coding RNA as an adjuvant for a licensed rabies vaccine resulting in improved immunogenicity. developed is steering towards personalized cancer immunotherapeutic vaccine products via a library of mRNAs coding for different antigens that can be combined to be personalized for an individual. a much larger number of trials for cancer utilize mRNA for ex vivo transfection of dendritic cells that are then re-infused into the patient. the rabies vaccine effort was replaced by a vaccine using mRNA encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein. new construct versus prior trial NCT03713086 mRNA-1851 Moderna Influenza H7N9 Influenza Hemagglutinin H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013. no published data NCT03345043 mRNA-1440 Moderna Influenza H10N8 Influenza Hemagglutinin H10N8. moderna press release says 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 endpoints met, but no published data Not listed on clinicaltrials.gov Table 4. mRNA-based Adjuvant: long-chain non-coding RNA complexed with a short cationic peptide (ssRNA adjuvant); no mRNA-encoded antigen Rabies: Phase 1, Completed; ssRNA adjuvant plus licensed rabies vaccine. personalized, tumor-derived antigens Gastronintestinal cancers Non-small cell lung cancer Breast cancer Various personalized tumor vaccines. one company initially highlighted a focus on therapeutic disease areas but reprioritized vaccines, possibly due to the recognition of the low amount of antigen actually produced by the mRNA coupled with the low amounts of protein needed for vaccines. the company has published relatively little in the peer-reviewed literature related to their clinical trials. mRNA as a therapy for HIV infection was tested in two clinical trials where it was administered intranodally. the second phase 2 trial was terminated after the interim analysis due to lack of immunogenicity above that seen with placebo. mRNA adjuvant was tested in two clinical trials where it was administered intranodally. the second phase 2 trial was terminated due to lack of immunogenicity above that seen with the placebo. four completed studies have been terminated or completed for prostate cancer. pre-clinical immunogenicity or even protection/therapy, and human immunogenicity are low hurdles and are not predictive of human efficacy. the vaccine technology alone is not the only piece of the puzzle. mRNA vaccines have been extensively studied pre-clinically and clinically. mRNA needs to escape the endosome (but does not need entry into the nucleus, whereas plasmid DNA does) 3) Immunostimulatory effects may decrease potency via multiple pathways. finding the optimal delivery formulation/device for humans may be challenging given the unknown predictability of animal models. limited systemic AEs for the majority of patients (78%) and grade three AEs in 10% of patients following doses of 80\u2013400 g mRNA via different routes. it is not known whether the pre-clinical hepatic toxicity that proved to be a \u201cno go\u201d result for a particular mRNA candidate is relevant to the mRNA vaccine studies from the same company. edward et al."}
