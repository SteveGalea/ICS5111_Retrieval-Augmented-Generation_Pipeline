{"summary": "despite successful eradication of smallpox in 1979, last case of rinderpest in 2008 and current campaigns to eradicate poliomyelitis and measles through mass-immunization programmes, we still face the prospect of emerging or reemerging viral pathogens. these include intravenous drug abuse, unregulated marketing of domestic and wild animals, expanding human population densities, increasing human mobility, and dispersion of livestock, arthropods and commercial goods. arboviruses are transmitted between arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, midges, bugs...) and vertebrates during the life cycle of the virus. many arboviruses are zoonotic, i.e., transmissible from animals to humans. arboviruses have an enormous choice of arthropod species potentially capable of being infected. 116 different species are currently known to transmit arboviruses. 25 midge species have been shown to transmit arboviruses. outbreaks of west Nile fever/encephalitis in north America often appear to occur in the late summer. aedes albopictus occurs more commonly in semi-urban or rural areas. however, these are not hard and fast rules. tick-borne encephalitis virus occurs mainly in northern temperate regions which are the primary habitats of Ixodes species ticks (forests etc.) despite the relatively localized distribution of arboviruses, dispersion to distant locations occurs via animal migration. the virus survives via its sylvatic life cycle which may involve a wide variety of species currently not identified. eggs can also provide a long term reservoir for tick-borne arboviruses. non-viraemic transmission provides an efficient mechanism for transmission of the virus directly between ticks, without necessarily infecting the vertebrate host. arboviruses adapt readily to new susceptible hosts by alteration of receptor specificity, transmission efficiency, antigenicity, and ecological and environmental conditions. humans, livestock and/or domestic animals are not an essential part of this arbovirus life cycle. the reservoir for arboviruses in wild species places a limitation on our ability to control disease emergence. on 6 December 2013, it was reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the French Caribbean island of Saint Martin from where it dispersed to the Americas. it also dispersed eastwards from southern Asia, reaching Polynesia by October 2014.6 Worryingly, CHIKV is now frequently introduced into non-endemic Europe and northern Asia by incoming humans. the concept of arthropod-borne disease transmission was born out of the studies of a physician, Josiah Clark,48 and 40 years later developed by Carlos Finlay49. in the 21st century genetically engineered live attenuated vaccines can be manufactured within months, to protect humans from potentially fatal infection by yellow fever virus. arthropod control measures can still play an important but transient role in reducing the impact of emerging arboviruses. there is also a lack of inter-disciplinary expertise on arbovirus diseases and understanding their vectors, and epidemiology. only a small number of arboviral diseases can be prevented using vaccines or specific antiviral drugs. arboviruses and arbovirus-related viruses infect more than just humans, invertebrates and land-based animals. they also infect plants, fish and marine animals. this is undoubtedly an incomplete list of recommendations and probably some cannot easily be implemented. arbovirus disease control in the future!"}
