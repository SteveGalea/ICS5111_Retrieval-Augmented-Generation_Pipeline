{"summary": "small molecule inhibitors of RNA virus replication are potent antiviral drugs. CPZ and QC compounds inhibited TBSV RNA accumulation in plants and in protoplasts. QC was shown to have an effect on multiple steps of TBSV replication. TBSV, a small (+)RNA virus of plants, has emerged as a highly suitable model virus for studying viral RNA replication and recombination. p33 is an essential replication co-factor performing recruitment of the viral RNA template into replication [11], [12], [13], and in assembly of the viral replicase [14]. systematic genome-wide screens covering 95% of yeast genes have led to the identification of over 100 host factors affecting TBSV RNA replication. one of the surprising findings from these genome-wide screens is the observation that TBSV co-opt some host factors that also affect prion propagation, such as protein chaperones and ribosomal proteins [20], [21], [26], [27]. two acridine derivatives are known anti-prion molecules active against both yeast and mammalian prions. the TBSV genomic (g)RNA was introduced via electroporation into Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts, whereas CPZ and QC were added to the culture media either prior to electroporation or after electroporation. both CPZ and QC inhibited TBSV accumulation by 70 and 50%, respectively, when applied prior to electroporation the samples were harvested 40 hours after electroporation. the ethidium-bromide stained gel at the bottom shows the ribosomal (r)RNA levels as loading controls. in vitro replicase assembly assay, first 40 min consist of recruitment of repRNA, viral replication proteins and host proteins, such as Hsp70 to the membrane [23], [32], followed by the assembly of the membrane-bound replicase complex. CPZ and QC likely inhibit early steps in virus replication. the second in vitro replication assay was similar to that described in panel A. the membrane fraction of the yeast cell-free extract was treated with CPZ, QC or DMSO first, followed by a washing step to remove the unbound compounds. the experiments were done in duplicates and the right panel shows reproducibility. CPZ pretreated the membrane fraction of the yeast cell extract for 15 min with either CPZ, QC or DMSO as a control. then we washed the membrane fraction with buffer A to remove the chemicals not bound to membrane lipids. the TBSV replicase can be successfully assembled in vitro. virus replicase was reduced to 23% by QC treatment. CPZ had only minor effect (lanes 2, 4, 5) when compared with DMSO treated sample. neither compounds inhibited the activity of the solubilized and partially purified tombusvirus replicase programmed with a ()repRNA template. in vitro binding experiments suggest that QC can strongly interfere with binding of p33 to the TBSV (+)RNA. effect of CPZ on the interaction might only be effective at lower p33 concentrations (e.g., in beginning of infection) in vitro wheat germ translation assay was programmed with artificial capped p33 mRNA carrying a poly(A) tail. CPZ and QC inhibit TBSV RNA Accumulation in N. benthamiana plants Based. infiltration of leaves with 600 M CPZ solution 30 min prior to inoculation of the same leaves with TBSV virion preparation resulted in 99% inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation at 4 dpi. CPZ treatment also inhibited the virus symptom formation and the rapid death of the plants caused by the systemic invasion by TBSV RNA. CPZ inhibits the Accumulation of Tobacco Mosaic Virus and Turnip Crinkle Virus. DMSO treatment of plant leaves prior to inoculation with TBSV virion preparation also resulted in inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation in the infiltrated leaves. the protection caused by QC treatment against TBSV infections is incomplete and temporary under the conditions used. CPZ inhibited the accumulation of TMV RNA by 80% (Fig. 7A, lanes 3\u20134) and that of TCV by up to 43% (Fig. 7B\u2013C). QC treatment reduced TCV RNA accumulation by 90% when applied prior to electroporation in protoplasts. DMSO concentrations were the following: 0.03%, lanes 3, 6, 11; 0.04%, lanes 4, 7, 12; 0.06%, lanes 5, 8, 9, 13, 14; and 0.08% in lanes 10 and 15. DMSO concentrations were the following: 0.005%, lanes 1, 4; 0.01%, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6; 0.02%, lanes 7, 10; and 0.06% in lanes 8, 9 and 11. the TBSV genomic (g)RNA was introduced via electroporation into Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts. CPZ and QC were added to the culture media either prior to electroporation or after electroporation. both CPZ and QC inhibited TBSV accumulation by 70 and 50%. CPZ was also effective in reducing TBSV RNA accumulation by 60% in protoplasts when applied after electroporation. the gRNA can reach rRNA levels in N. benthamiana protoplasts. the survival of the plant cells was checked by measuring rRNA levels in total RNA extracts. CPZ and QC inhibit TBSV rep. CPZ, QC and DMSO were added to the assay at 0, 20, 40 or 60 min after the start of the assay, which lasted for 3 hours. CPZ, QC and DMSO were added to the assay at 0, 20, 40 or 60 min after the start of the assay. the experiments were done in duplicates and the right panel shows reproducibility. the data show the averages and standard deviations including both sets. the third in vitro replication assay contained a partially purified tombusvirus replicase preparation, a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled nucleotides. repRNA was detected in the in vitro replication assay in the presence of the control DMSO. pre-treatment of the membrane fraction with CPZ led to 3-fold decrease in the TBSV replicase activity in vitro. QC inhibits the subsequent assembly of the TBSV replicase complex. QC Inhibits the Binding of p33 replication protein to the Viral (+)RNA Previous works defined binding of p33 replication protein to an internal recognition element, termed p33RE. binding of p33 to RII(+)-SL is absolutely essential for TBSV replication in plants, plant protoplasts, in yeast cells and in the authentic in vitro TBSV replication system. in vitro band-shift assay included the radiolabeled RII(+)-SL sequence. p33C is a soluble, N-terminally truncated version of p33. p33C is a soluble, N-terminally truncated version of p33. CPZ and QC inhibit TBSV RNA Accumulation in plant leaves. both compounds were needed at higher concentrations for treatment of plant leaves. infiltration of leaves with 600 M CPZ solution 30 min prior to inoculation resulted in 99% inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation. leaves were first infiltrated with CPZ (600 M), followed by inoculation of the same leaves with TBSV virion preparation. samples for viral RNA analysis were taken from the infiltrated leaves at 4 dpi. DMSO sample was chosen as 100%. delay in symptom development due to TBSV infections in the CPZ treated plant. infiltration of leaves with QC (1600 M), inoculation with TBSV and analysis of RNA samples were done as described under Fig. 5. QC treatment resulted in delay of TBSV symptom formation when compared with DMSO-treated control plants. CPZ inhibited the accumulation of TMV RNA by 80%. QC reduced TBSV RNA accumulation by 90% when applied prior to electroporation in N. benthamiana protoplasts. TBSV replication was more sensitive to CPZ treatment than TCV replication. DMSO concentrations were the following: 0.005%, lanes 1, 4; 0.01%, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6; 0.02%, lanes 7, 10; and 0.06% in lanes 8, 9 and 11. Discussion Small molecule inhibitors of virus replication are drug candidates to interfere with virus infections or cure viral diseases. CPZ and QC affected TBSV replication. QC also inhibited minus-strand synthesis, but not (+)-strand synthesis. QC also inhibited the translation of TBSV genomic RNA. cis-acting RNA structures, such as p33RE, are magnified. CPZ has been shown to affect mostly one step. TBSV replication was not inhibited by QC efficiently. CPZ did not inhibit () or (+)strand synthesis in an assay with the solubilized/purified tombusvirus replicase. in vitro replication of the TBSV repRNA was reduced only moderately by CPZ when used at a late (60 min) time point. it is likely that CPZ inhibits the assembly of the TBSV replicase. replication and the assembly of the replicase of some RNA viruses needs bending of the membranes in inward direction to assemble viral-induced spherules. the opposing bending effect of CPZ and viral replication proteins during the replicase assembly might lead to reduced efficiency of viral replicase assembly. CPZ has been shown to inhibit the assembly of enveloped viruses [65], [66], which also require membrane bending. effect of QC seems to be narrower and includes plant viruses without cap and poly(A) ends, such as TBSV and TCV, members of a large family of plant viruses. TBSV, TMV and TCV RNA Accumulation in N. Benthamiana Protoplasts Total RNA was extracted 40 hrs after electroporation, followed by agarose gel analysis and Northern blotting using radiolabeled TBSV probe. the template for the TMV RNA probe was generated by PCR using the full-length cDNA for TMV and primers. a close relative of TBSV can replicate TBSV RNA templates as efficiently as the TBSV replicase [34]. the replicase is template dependent and it can use added TBSV-derived RNA templates for complementary RNA synthesis, including (+) or ()RNA synthesis. the recombinant proteins were used in 1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.1 g for incubation with 1 ng of radioactively labeled RII(+)-SL RNA [13] in a binding buffer [12 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 15 mM KCl, 0.2 M DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 U of RNase inhibitor (Ambion)] 1 l of CPZ (final concentration of 30 M or 50 M), QC (10 or 20 M) and DMSO (0.05%) was also added. in vitro translation was stopped by denaturation at 100\u00b0C for 3 minutes. CPZ and QC dissolved in DMSO were added to protoplasts 30 min before or 1 hour after electroporation of the viral RNAs. in the control samples, DMSO was added to the protoplasts at similar concentrations to that present in CPZ or QC preparations. incubation of protoplasts was done in the dark at room temperature. the membrane fraction washed twice with 100 l buffer A (30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, and 2 mM magnesium acetate) after the wash step, we performed the TBSV replication assay for 3 hours at 25\u00b0C using the above membrane fraction. radioactively labeled RII(+)-SL RNA was obtained using PCR template. PCR template made with primers # 2144 (5\u2032-GTAATACGACTATAGAGGTTTGTGTGTAAGTACG-3\u2032) and DI-72 cDNA clone. 0.3 pmol of RNA transcripts, 3 l wheat germ extract and 0.3 l amino acid mix without methionine were mixed in 50 mM potassium acetate with a final volume of 6 l. in vitro translation was stopped by denaturation at 100\u00b0C for 3 minutes. s. Northern blot analysis was performed with a TBSV specific probe."}
