{"summary": "DNA vaccines are circular plasmid DNA molecules that encode vaccinating antigens. these antigens are synthesized inside cells of the injected body. many efforts have been made to increase the immunising potential of these vaccines. if there are no plasmids detected, plasmid integration event may not have occurred. it is conceivable that there is a potential risk of partial or complete integration of plasmid DNA into the host cell genome. if there are no plasmids detected, plasmid integration event may not have occurred. pigs were anesthetized with an auricular intravenous injection of thiopental (1 g/50 kg body weight) the first and second group were injected with 2.5 1014 copies of PrV-gB-pcDNA3 prepared in 600 L PBS. the third one received 2.5 1014 copies of pcDNA3 and the last group was injected with PBS. each pulse [7] was applied through stainless-steel electrodes (0.2 mm wires, 1 cm long, and 10 mm apart) the electric current was applied with a BTX ECM 830 pulse generator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) plasmid DNA concentration was measured in each muscle sample by quantitative PCR (qPCR) the target of the qPCR is a 92 nucleotides sequence located in the neomycin gene of the plasmids. pigs were injected with 2.5 1014 copies of PrV-gB-pcDNA3. the third one received 2.5 1014 copies of pcDNA3. the last group was injected with PBS. 0.45 mm 12 mm needles were used. DNA Extraction and Quantification of Plasmids by quantitative PCR (qPCR) prior to DNA extraction, the 2 cm long pieces of muscle excised were divided into six equal samples (from the superior to the inferior part of the muscle) each muscle fraction was weighed and resuspended in PBS buffer according to the measured mass. homogenization was carried out using a Teflon pestle at 30 Hz for 1 min. adverse reactions, no fever, and no delay in the growth of the pigs were observed during the 6-week period following these injections. the mean weight of the animals 6 weeks after injection was 66.5 5.4 kg. this means that the piglets gained 41.8 4.0 kg during the whole experimental period (i.e., about 170% of their initial weight) the concentrations were higher in F2\u2013F4 (1 pig in F2, 2 pigs in F3, and 1 pig in F4) when electroporation was applied. in F4-F5 (3 pigs in F4 and 1 pig in F5), that is, deeper, in the other case. this seems consistent with the fact that less diffusion of the plasmids and better precision of injection are observed with electroporation. the excised muscle portion was divided into six fractions, F1 to F6. plasmid DNA concentration was measured in each fraction after DNA extraction. levels of PrV-gB-pcDNA3 present in injected piglets were quantified by real-time qPCR. conflict of interests The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
