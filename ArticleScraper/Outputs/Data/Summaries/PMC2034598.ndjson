{"summary": "the paradigm for class I fusion proteins consists of two heptad repeat regions, and a hydrophobic fusion peptide [1]. this motif is present in SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. fusion proteins can also be divided into two sub-types. the virus is internalized in the cell by endocytosis. the SARS spike performs the same fundamental task in viral entry to the host cell as other class I viral fusion proteins. the two large external domains S1 and S2 are largely responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. the fusion core heptad repeats of the spike have been solved to atomic resolution [2], [3], [24]\u2013[26]. the atomic resolution structures of two neutralizing antibodies bound to the SARS spike receptor-binding domain have been solved. the aim of the present study was to delineate any possible structural changes in the SARS spike that accompanied receptor-binding, and to precisely localize the receptor binding domains. inactivated -irradiated virus preparations were incubated with a human ACE2-human Fc chimeric protein. the ACE2-Fc construct was selected because it is soluble and dimeric. immuno-EM confirmed that recombinant ACE2 protein bound to virions and that binding affinity was not affected by -irradiation. Cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV and ACE2 bound to ACE2 were employed to investigate the binding of ACE2 to the spike of SARS-CoV. ACE2 is approximately spherical when observed by cryo-EM, but both its size and shape vary slightly. however, individual spikes on the surface envelope of the virus do provide a repetitive structure that is ideal for single particle techniques. the bound spike difference map included both the ACE2 component (purple) and a re-arrangement of the outer edges of the three \u201cblades\u201d of the S1 domain (green). the resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between two half reconstructions of the SARS spike-ACE2 complex. the exact location of ACE2 binding on the distal end of the spike is centered at 70 from the central axis of the spike, with a 30 gap between the axis of symmetry and ACE2. the density of these ACE2 molecules is high in the 3D density map, indicating a high occupancy of binding sites. previously we modeled the putative location of the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 in the cryo-EM structure of the unbound spike using solely the receptor-binding domain atomic resolution data. the actual location of the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 are in fact shifted 29 towards the 3-fold axis, corresponding to about 40% of the diameter of ACE2. the results from the present study will aid in the precise location of future atomic resolution structure fragments of the SARS spike the spike of SARS-CoV is approximately spherical when observed by cryo-EM. both its size and shape vary slightly, and thus it is not amenable to single-particle averaging techniques. however, individual spikes on the surface envelope of virus particles do provide a repetitive structure that is ideal for single particle techniques. the resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between two half reconstructions of the SARS spike-ACE2 complex. the positive component attributed to the SARS spike in (B,G) indicates a re-arrangement in the S2 core. the positive component attributed to the SARS spike in (B,G) indicates a re-arrangement in the S2 core. a structure 220 high in the 3D density map shows a high occupancy of binding sites. binding of one ACE2 to the spike would not sterically hinder binding of additional ACE2 molecules on the other two propeller-blades of each trimer. the receptor-binding domain- ACE2 data were docked with a correlation score of 0.965 using the SITUS software package. the actual location of the receptor binding domain and ACE2 are in fact shifted 29 towards the 3-fold axis, corresponding to about 40% of the diameter of ACE2. the results from the present study will aid in the precise location of future atomic resolution structure fragments of the SARS spike. the coronavirus S protein is known to mediate both virion-cell membrane fusion, and intercellular membrane fusion [22], [30]\u2013[33]. we show that purified inactivated virions are also fusion-competent. the trigger that initiates membrane fusion varies amongst class I fusion proteins. class I viral fusion proteins achieve membrane fusion have been proposed [1], [4], [17]\u2013[19], but complete structural evidence for the role of intermediate structures in these mechanisms has yet to be obtained. the structural biology of this process has been best characterized for the influenza hemagglutinin, and paramyxovirus fusion (F) protein. oligomeric multiples higher than three would be favored, whereas the \u201ctripod\u201d model of receptor binding favors the conserved trimeric structures of class I viral fusion proteins. ACE2\u2013SARS structures were solved in this cryo-EM investigation. RNA viruses have a high rate of mutation and recombination. rapid evolution to gain specificity for novel ACE2 species has been demonstrated. structure and large size of spike appears to be adaptation related to utilization of large host cell-surface molecules such as ACE2 as specific receptors. virus was inoculated onto vero E6 cells grown in modified eagle medium. it was supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.22 mg/ml l-glutamine. cell supernatant was harvested (300 ml) with a SARS-CoV TCID50 titre of 5107/ml. syncytia was not detected at either dilution of irradiated virus. the presence of nucleic acid in syncytia was investigated by iodide staining. grids were fixed for 2 minutes (1% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS), washed in deionised water and negatively stained with 2% methylamine tungstate (Nanoprobes) digital images were collected using a Tecnai 20 G2 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated at 200 kV. images of SARS-CoV were digitized on a Nikon super coolscan 9000 ED scanner at a pixel size of 2.125. processing was carried out using the EMAN and SPIDER/WEB image processing program packages. images were corrected for contrast transfer function (ctf) using the \u201cctfit\u201d function in the EMAN software package. the resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction was estimated to be 18.5 using the 0.5 FSC criteria. the structures of the pre-fusion HR2 domain and the ACE2-receptor-binding domain were docked into the cryo-EM reconstruction using the \u201cfloodfill\u201d and \u201ccolores\u201d functions in the SITUS software package. the resultant docking generated one distinct location for the ACE2-receptor-binding domain. 6 cells grown in modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.22 mg/ml l-glutamine. virus pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer, layered onto a 12\u201330% iodoxanol gradient. the plates were washed three times with fresh culture medium to remove unbound virus. syncytia was not detected at either dilution of irradiated virus. grids were fixed for 2 minutes (1% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS), washed in deionised water and negatively stained with 2% methylamine tungstate. digital images were collected using a Tecnai 20 G2 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated at 200 kV. nification in the microscope that SARS-CoV was imaged at was determined to be 29,968 using a calibration grid (Pelco International) images were digitized on a Nikon super coolscan 9000 ED scanner at a pixel size of 2.125. processing was carried out using the EMAN and SPIDER/WEB image processing program packages. the structures of the pre-fusion HR2 domain and the ACE2-receptor-binding domain were docked into the cryo-EM reconstruction using the \u201cfloodfill\u201d and \u201ccolores\u201d functions. the resultant docking generated one distinct location for the ACE2-receptor-binding domain, which placed ACE2 in the additional mass that was not present in the reconstruction of the spike alone. the movie starts showing the spike-ACE2 complex viewed from an end-on perspective. the reconstruction then tilts 90o, followed by a 120o rotation along the three-fold axis of symmetry of the spike. in the second section the cryo-EM reconstruction becomes transparent.
