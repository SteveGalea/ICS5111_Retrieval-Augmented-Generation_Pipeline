{"summary": "Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. infected macrophages secrete intercellular signaling factors, proinflammatory cytokines, to mediate the inflammatory response leading to the formation of granuloma. signaling pathways induced by mycobacteria have long been a subject of interest. previous reports have shown that p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are required in the induction of TNF- expression in human monocytes infected with phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases (MKPs) are also known as MAPK phosphatases (MKPs). the regulatory role of MKP-1 on cytokine induction is best demonstrated by MKP-1 knock-out macrophages. the emergence of DUSP2 turned the concept up side down. it was shown that DUSP2 behaves differently and is opposite to the function. DUSP2 KO cells produced less inflammatory mediators. crosstalks between MAPKs and phosphatases need further investigation. the MKP family plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses. innate immune response protects host from MTB infection. effects on MKP-1 induction continued for 3 hours post-treatment with Pam3Cys. poly IC did not induce MKP-1. different inducers show differential up-regulation of MKP-1 expression. kinetics of MKP-1 expression in PBMo was studied by using QPCR. the effects lasted for at least 6 hours (Figure 2A) the results showed that there was MKP-1 induction in response to BCG activation in human monocytes. inhibition of p38 MAPK either by specific inhibitor or siRNA reduced the expression of MKP-1 in LPS- or peptidoglycan-treated macrophages. levels of MKP-1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR method. transfection of siRNA into PBMo was used to knockdown activity of MKP-1. cells were treated with Mock (M) or BCG (B, MOI = 1 CFU/cell) for 3 hours. levels of MKP-1 mRNA were measured by Western blotting. the levels of BCG-induced MKP-1 protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 4-6). together, the results suggest that MKP-1 siRNA reduced the MKP-1 mRNA in BCG treatment but also abrogated the BCG-induced MKP-1 protein. mRNA were measured by QPCR method. following exposure to control or MKP-1 siRNA, there were significant inductions of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels for 3 hours after treatment. the effects of MKP-1 siRNA were examined on the cytokine expression induced by BCG. p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in response to BCG was decreased in monocytes transfected with MKP-1 siRNA instead of the expected increase in phosphorylation. results suggest that reduced level of TNF- production in BCG stimulated monocytes is due to reduced phosphorylation of MAPKs by MKP-1 siRNA. ys (TLR2 agonist), poly IC (TLR3 agonist), or LPS (TLR4 agonist) for 1 and 3 hours. effects on MKP-1 induction continued for 3 hours post-treatment. different inducers show differential up-regulation of MKP-1 expression. kinetics of MKP-1 expression in PBMo was studied by using QPCR. the effects lasted for at least 6 hours. the protein levels were maintained for 2 hours and dropped to basal levels at 3 hours. the results showed that there was MKP-1 induction in response to BCG activation in human monocytes. inhibition of p38 MAPK either by specific inhibitor or siRNA reduced the expression of MKP-1 in LPS- or peptidoglycan-treated macrophages [14] BCG (MOI = 1 CFU/cell) was then added for 1 hour and RNA was harvested. levels of MKP-1 were measured by QPCR. monocytes were treated with Mock (M) or BCG (B, MOI = 1 CFU/cell) for 3 hours. levels of MKP-1 mRNA were measured by Western blotting. the levels of BCG-induced MKP-1 protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 4-6). however, the levels of BCG-induced MKP-1 protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure 4B, lanes 4-6). CG-induced cytokine expression, levels of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA were measured by QPCR method. following exposure to control or MKP-1 siRNA, there were significant inductions of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels for 3 hours after treatment. the effects of MKP-1 siRNA were examined on the cytokine expression induced by BCG. phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in response to BCG was decreased in monocytes transfected with MKP-1 siRNA instead of the expected increase in phosphorylation. the results suggest that MKP-1 knockdown would result in reduced MAPK phosphorylation by BCG. previous reports have shown that MKP-1 induced by LPS or peptidoglycan is dependent on p38 MAPK. this is because degradation of MKP-1 is reduced after ERK1/2 phosphorylation. it is believed other proteins may be involved in the BCG-induced MKP-1 expression. MKP-1 plays a critical role in regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. in this scenario, LPS activates MKP-1, which in turn dephosphorylates and deactivates phospho-p38 MAPK, resulting in less TNF- induction. DUSP2 behaves differently from other MKP family members. in DUSP2 KO macrophages treated with LPS, they produced less inflammatory mediators including less TNF, IL-6, nitric oxide, and IL-12-producing cells. it is plausible that these unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by DUSP2 were due to crosstalks between MAPKs [13] in this case, BCG induces MKP-1 expression while also activates MAPKs including p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. the unknown factor in turn inhibits MAPKs activation, which ultimately leads to more TNF- induction. plasma was removed and incubated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. it was quickly chilled on ice and centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes. supernatant was then filtered through syringe filter and used as autologous plasma.
