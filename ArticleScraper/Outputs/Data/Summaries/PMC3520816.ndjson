{"summary": "a variety of animals have been used to produce monoclonal antibodies against antigens. however, the production of monoclonal antibodies from animals remains challenging. mAbs from animals other than rodents have not been routinely produced. the use of ASPCs is best suited to the isolation of high affinity mAbs. the current plasma/plasmablast cell isolation protocols rely on a small number of identified PC-specific markers combined with the absence of one or more B cell differentiation antigens. however, expensive equipment and acquired technical skills are required to identify and isolate ASPCs from the bulk of the PC population. antigen-specific PC screening method is termed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based identification of antigen-specific antibody-producing cells (ERIAA) using FACS and a fluorescent dye specific for the endoplasmic reticulum. a 1-week protocol for the production of recombinant mAbs from a variety of animals. the pairs of IgH and IgL genes were cotransfected into 293FT cells grown in 96-well culture dishes. a fluorescent dye specific for the ER could be used to identify PCs. 79.3% of the IgGlow ERhigh cells (R2 gate) were found in the PC fraction. 75.7% of the IgGlow ERhigh cells (R2 gate) were found in the PC fraction. an intense cytoplasmic IgG signal was found in 70% to 90% of the R2-gated cells. the percentage of PCs identified by IgGlow ERhigh in R2 gate is not compatible with that identified by lineage markers (2.7%). the forward-versus-side-scatter (FSC vs SSC) with gate R1 represents lymphocytes. the R1-gated cells were stained with anti-mouse IgG Dylight 488 and ER-tracker. the relative number of cells in each region is given as a mean percentage of three separate experiments. the cells stained intracellularly with anti-human IgG Dylight 488 (green) the numbers indicate the percentages of cells with intense cytoplasmic IgG. the cells in the R3 and R4 gates were sorted and examined for expression of an IgG specific for GFP. 76% of the IgGlow ERhigh GFP- cells (R4 gate) expressed an intense cytoplasmic IgG signal, but only 11% of the cells reacted with GFP. low ERhigh GFP+ cells (R3) or IgGlow ERhigh GFP- cells (R4) showed 76% of the cells reacted with GFP. only 2% of the R4-gated cells reacted with GFP. both rabbits and rats received the same GFP as the immunogen. percentages of cells stained intracellularly with anti-rabbit IgG Dylight 594 (red) and GFP-Dylight 488 (green) numbers indicate mean percentages of cells exhibiting IgG and GFP signals from two separate experiments. the numbers indicate the mean percentages of cells in the gated area from three separate experiments. guinea pigs produce high-affinity antibodies against human insulin. guinea pigs produce high-affinity antibodies against human insulin. guinea pigs were stained with anti-guinea pig IgG Dylight 488, ER-tracker and insulin-Cy3. a high amplification success rate for cognate pairs of VH, VL and/or VL genes from the single-cell-sorted R3-gated cells was achieved (89%, 126 of 142) guinea pig lymphocytes stained with anti-guinea pig IgG, ER-tracker and insulin-Cy3. we hypothesized that a fluorescent dye specific for the ER could be used to identify PCs without using antibodies against lineage markers. 79.3% of the IgGlow ERhigh cells (R2 gate) were found in the PC fraction. an intense cytoplasmic IgG signal was found in 82% of the R2-gated cells. PCs identified by IgGlow ERhigh (0.2%) in R2 gate are not compatible with that identified by lineage markers (2.7%). rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends PCR (5' RACE PCR) resulted in the amplification of cognate pairs of VH, VL and/or VL genes. results clearly indicate that PCs can be isolated without using antibodies against lineage markers. mouse IgG Dylight 488 (green) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue) the numbers indicate the mean percentages of cells with intense cytoplasmic IgG from three separate experiments. a representative FACS graph of cells prepared from the lymph nodes of cancer patients is shown. a series of antibodies against lineage markers is not required for PC identification. this procedure enables PC isolation from a variety of animals. we then tried to isolate ASPCs using a fluorescently labeled antigen as a tag for a complementary cell surface IgG. a single-cell-based 5' PCR of the R3-gated and R4-gated cells resulted in the amplification of cognate pairs of VH and VL genes. mAbs specific for GFP were produced with a high efficiency from the R3-gated cells. mAbs specific for GFP were produced with a high efficiency from the R3-gated cells. method to identify and collect ASPCs from rabbit antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells (ASPCs) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) cognate pairs of linear IgH and IgL genes were cotransfected into 293FT cells. antigen specificity of mAbs was expressed as relative light units (RLU)/IgG (lower) cognate pairs of linear IgH and IgL genes were cotransfected into 293FT cells. the antigen specificity of the mAbs was expressed as relative light units (RLU)/IgG. guinea pigs produce high-affinity antibodies against human insulin. clones clustered in group 1 (a32, c08 and c68) were directed to an epitope that includes residues B20-30. clones react with the C-terminal of the B chain, but their binding was partially inhibited by B1-20 nor B20-30. the isolation of ASPCs is one of the most challenging types of cell separation due to the scarcity of ASPCs in lymph nodes and blood. the main limitation in isolating ASPCs is the non-specific binding of cells to fluorescently labeled antigens. mice, rabbits and rats were able to isolate ASPCs with a fluorescently labeled antigen. the isolation of ASPCs from spleen by ERIAA is less efficient due to the presence of non-plasma cells with strong ER-tracker signal. anti-mouse CD45R-PE, anti-mouse CD38-APC, anti-human CD20-PE and anti-human CD38-APC were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec. all antibodies were diluted in 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI 373XL DNA sequencer (Life Technologies). Restriction enzymes and PrimeStar DNA polymerase with 1 PrimeStar GC buffer were obtained from Takara Bio (http://www.takara-bio.com/). Guinea pigs were immunized four times intramuscularly at the tail base. at 1 week after the final immunization, the iliac or popliteal lymph nodes were surgically removed. human lymphocytes were prepared from surgically removed regional lymph nodes from patients with gallbladder and colon cancers. versus-side-scatter (FSC vs SSC) lymphocyte gate (R1) was applied to exclude dead cells. cells were deposited onto propyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides. cells were stained with a fluorescently labeled antibody against IgG. rabbit, rat and guinea pig immunoglobulin gamma (IgG), kappa (IgK) and lambda (Ig) constant regions were amplified using lymphocyte cDNAs as the templates. the amplified DNA fragments digested with XhoI and NotI were inserted into the corresponding sites of pJON-IgG. the antigens were labeled with DyLight Fluor Labeling Reagents. Molecular cloning of VH and VL genes from single cells VH and VL genes were amplified by 5' PCR using the 3'-end homopolymer-tailed cDNA fragments as the templates. the second round of PCR was performed with a forward primer (Nhe-Eco47) and a respective nested reverse primer (IgGV AS2, IgKV AS2 or IgV AS2). the primers used are summarized in Table 1.
