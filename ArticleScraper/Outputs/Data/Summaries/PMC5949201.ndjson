{"summary": "the introduction porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been one of the most economically significant swine pathogens worldwide for over two decades. it is characterized by reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory disease in all stages of pigs [3, 4], leading to huge economic losses to global swine industry [5, 6]. a number of transcriptomic experiments have been conducted to reveal the gene expression profiles of PRRSV-infected PAMs in an in vitro infection model or in vivo challenge model. the in vitro model helps us to assess the direct impacts of PAMs in response to PRRSV infection independently of the respiratory immune system. RNA-Seq provides enormous amounts of sequence data, usually tenfold or one hundredfold greater than those produced using traditional Sanger sequencing technology. lncRNAs are arbitrarily defined as RNA molecules of greater than 200 nucleotides in length with poor protein-coding capacity. compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs are more cell type-specific, less expressed, and less well-conserved. lncRNAs are more cell type-specific, less expressed, and less well-conserved. we also unraveled the potential role of essential lncRNAs involved in PRRSV infection in PAMs. a comprehensive understanding of the roles of PRRSV-PAMs interaction in PRRSV at the transcriptional level remains to be determined.

RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation. clean data of high quality were then aligned to the Sus scrofa genome assembly (Sus scrofa 10.2) using topHat2 (v2.0.9) [47]. Transcripts, including annotated mRNAs and lncRNAs, were identified according to the Sus scrofa genome assembly (Sus scrofa 10.2) lncRNA differential expression analyses were performed for all pairwise comparisons including PV6 versus PM, PV9 versus PM, PV12 versus PM, and PV12 versus PV9. differentially expressed genes in all PRRSV-infected groups were compared with the genes in mock-infected group (PV versus PM) all qRT-PCR reactions were performed on a 7500 real-time PCR system (Fisher Scientific) using Quant One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (TIANGEN) with technical triplicates. qRT-PCR reactions were performed on a 7500 real-time PCR system. Graphpad Prism software (version 5.0) was used to determine the significance of the variability among different groups by two-way ANOVA test of variance. p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified (Figure 1). the number of upregulated mRNAs and lncRNAs was more than those of downregulated ones, indicating the activation status of PAMs. transcripts with the same change tendency and significant differences during PRRSV infection were also screened out for further analysis. further analyzing the potential role of these mRNAs and lncRNAs in the biological function of PAMs is required in order to expand the effect of PRRSV infection on PAMs in vitro. dots denote the expressed genes with a greater than 2-fold expression change and p value 0.05. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of expression profiles of differentially expressed mRNAs, annotated lncRNAs, and novel lncRNAs with the same change trend in PRRSV-infected groups. mRNA level of PRRSV N gene (a), expression patterns of multiple annotated mRNAs (b\u2013e), expression patterns of two annotated lncRNAs (f, g), and expression patterns of two novel lncRNAs (h, i) qRT-PCR was performed by using the primers specific for corresponding gene. these differentially expressed protein-coding genes included biological process terms (inflammatory response, immune response, defense response, and endocytosis) these genes included cellular component terms (nucleosome, DNA bending complex, and protein-DNA complex), molecular function terms (carbohydrate binding, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, oxidoreductase activity acting on a sulfur group of donors, and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily binding) overrepresented pathways were presented in Figures 5(e) and 5(f) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed protein-coding genes. shown are the top overrepresented pathways between PV6 and PM group (a), PV9 and PM group (b), PV12 and PM group (c), PV12 and PM group (d), and PV12 and PV9 group (e) PRRSV has evolved multiple strategies to interfere with IFN-mediated signaling pathways and to block the action of ISGs with antiviral activity. only PIK3R5 and PIK3CB were significantly suppressed in Pv9 group and Pv12 group (Table S3) by comparative analysis between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected groups. the basal levels of most characterized receptors in M1, M2a, and M2c phenotypes were higher. two M1-specific cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-), one M1-specific metabolic factor PTGS2, one M2a-specific chemokine C-C motif chemokine ligand 23 (CCL23) and one M2a-specific and one M2b-specific chemokine C-X-C motif ligand ( KEGG enrichment analysis showed the overrepresented antigen processing and presentation pathways. multiple isoforms of SLA-I and SLA-II and key genes involved in antigen processing were remarkably suppressed during PRRSV infection. several lncRNAs have been identified to regulate the proximal protein-coding genes in cis. none of them have been functionally identified in Sus scrofa assembly.
