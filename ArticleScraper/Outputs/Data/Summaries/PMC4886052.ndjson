{"summary": "melanoma is resistant to most types of chemotherapy by exploiting their intrinsic apoptosis resistance and by reprogramming the proliferative pathways during melanoma development [1\u20133]. melanoma cells have the ability to delay apoptotic death [4]. p-PD in the hair dyes is reported to serve as an external dyeing agent [5]. study using mice melanoma model showed p-PD induced apoptosis to inhibit tumour growth. monoclonal anti-PARP antibody (9532) and anti-actin antibody (4970) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, USA. anti-Bid antibody (ab77185) from Abcam, USA, was a kind gift from Dr. P. C. Sil from the Department of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India. p-PD, glutathione reductase, glutathione, NADPH, EDTA, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), DTNB, and all other reagents if not stated otherwise were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company, USA. the cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors for 2 hours and then treated for 24 hours with indicated concentrations of p-PD. this value was subtracted from the values obtained from all MTT assays using caspase inhibitors. the corrected values for sets without or with inhibitors were computed using the following equation. measure of Glutathione (GSH), Glutathione Disulfide (GSSG), Catalase, and Glutathione Reductase Activity GSH and GSSG were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. crude cell-free extract was added to an equal volume of 2 M HClO4 containing 2 mM EDTA and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. hed with PBS, and resuspended in 1x binding buffer. Annexin V-FITC and DAPI (1 g/mL) were added and incubated in the dark for 15 min. cells were then subjected to flow cytometric analysis on BD FACSVerse. the samples were analysed by BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSuite software. at least 20,000 events were analysed and recorded. immunofluorescent staining was done using fluorochrome conjugated anti-BrdU antibody. cells were stained with 7-AAD followed by analysis in BD FACSVerse. at least 20,000 events were recorded and analysed. in Vivo Antitumour Activity of p-PD B16-F10 cells (106 cells/50 L) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) on the right flank of Swiss-Albino mice for tumour generation. the tumour took approximately 2 weeks to become visible. anti-JNK antibody (sc-137018), caspase 9 inhibitor (C 1355), caspase 8 inhibitor (C 1230) and PAN caspase inhibitor (C 1355) were from Dr. Pijush. p-PD (100 mg/mL) was dissolved in DMSO. both types of cells were seeded at a density of 4 105 cells/30 mm plate. the culture medium was replaced with new medium before adding different concentrations of p-PD to treat the cells for indicated time points. % change in viable cell thus obtained were plotted against respective concentrations of p-PD. caspase 8 inhibitor (20 M), caspase 9 inhibitor (15 M), and PAN caspase inhibitor (40 M) cells treated only with these inhibitors do not show any adverse effect. the same neutralized extract was treated with 2-vinylpyridine (50 : 1, v/v) for 1 hour at room temperature. the same neutralized extract was treated with 2-vinylpyridine (50 : 1, v/v) for 1 hour at room temperature. basal early and late apoptosis values were first subtracted from respective values of 2nd and 3rd group. modified values are then used to calculate the % of reduction in apoptosis number. cells positive for only Annexin V-FITC and for both Annexin V-FITC and DAPI were considered as early and late apoptotic cells. JC 1 stained normal polarized cells will show high fluorescence in PE channel. low fluorescence in FITC channel (FITC fluorescence due to monomeric JC 1 present in the cell) at least 10,000 events were analysed and recorded. at least 10,000 events were analysed and recorded. p-PD treatment shows a positive increase in the median of green fluorescence hence in the quantity of ROS. the first group received vehicle in normal saline i.p. and the second and third groups received p-PD at doses 5 and 10 mg/kg/3 days (dose 1 and dose 2, resp.) i.p. up to 6 weeks. p-PD mediated death of melanoma cells. melanoma cells grown in a 96-well were treated with p-PD for 16, 24, and 48 hours at 37\u00b0C. in a similar manner, A375 cells were also treated with o-PD for 24 and 48 hours with indicated concentrations. mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with p-PD (5 and 10 mg/kg) at an interval of 3 days. after the treatment, the mice appeared to be quite active as the untreated ones. therefore, month-long peritoneal administration of as high as 10 mg/kg of p-PD did not show any sign of toxicity in Swiss-Albino mice. each set comprised 6 mice except for set (B) where initially 18 mice were used for the experiment. a meagre percentage of human population is reported to be allergic to p-PD at a concentration of 1% or above. study revealed no mortality and toxic symptoms with no biochemical changes in the major organs of the test groups treated with higher selected dose (10 mg/kg p-PD) no significant differences were found in body weight gain/loss, weight of major organs, and haematological and biochemical parameters of the control and test groups. the active form of PARP (89 kDa) was present in the treated cell lysates (lanes 2\u20134, 6\u20138, and 10\u201312) the active form of PARP (89 kDa) was present in the treated samples (lanes 1, 5, and 9) which are much less intense. p-PD mediates apoptosis in melanoma cells. p-PD mediates apoptosis in melanoma cells. a375 cells were treated with p-PD as indicated. a clear correlation is observed between the apoptotic cell numbers estimated by two different methods. it is to be noted that B16-F10 cells are more sensitive than A375 cells. sub-G0/G1 cells were estimated using standard cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. p-PD treated and untreated (control) A375 andB16-F10 cells were subjected to Annexin V-FITC assay as mentioned in the Materials and Methods. the number of cells in S phase for each set was determined and plotted against indicated concentration of p-PD. apoptotic cells, the activation of PARP could be the result of two divergent pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, for which activation of caspases 8 and 9 is the respective signature. p-PD activates extrinsic apoptotic pathways earlier than the intrinsic ones in human melanoma cells. cells treated for 6 and 24 hours were lysed with protein loading buffer. cells treated for 48 hours were lysed and analysed by western blot. the protective effects of the inhibitor of caspase 8 were 55, 41, and 45% for 20, 40, and 100 g/mL of p-PD. it is obvious that this effect is more in the cells treated with lesser p-PD. tBid is a known destabilizer of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) cells treated with 1 g/mL of p-PD for as low as 2 hours have undergone decrease in MMP. p-PD treatment for longer time led to formation of tBid in these cells. DCFH-DA staining was used to uncover the status of ROS in the control and treated cells. it is clear that A375 cells showed significant increase in the amount of ROS after 16 hours of treatment. this trend continued in 24-hour treated samples. cells isolated from p-PD treated mice tumours also showed a substantial increase in the ROS level when compared to the untreated tumour. change in biochemical parameters of oxidative stress induced by 100 g/mL of p-PD for 24 hours on a375 cells. p-PD treatment imparts strong oxidative stress to the cells. NAC, decreased the amount of ROS induced by p-PD (40 g/mL) these pretreatments also reduced extent of apoptosis in p-PD treated cells. this result strongly established a correlation between the ROS generation and the apoptotic death of p-PD treated melanoma cells. the increase in ROS in response to p-PD could not be obliterated by blocking the activation of caspase 8. this suggests that stimulation of ROS in p-PD treated cells occurs independently of the activation of caspase 8. suppression of ROS by NAC showed marked reduction in p-PD mediated apoptotic death in vitro. p-PD mediated death of melanoma cells in melanoma cells. treatment with 100 g/mL of p-PD reduced the viable cells up to 40 and 20%. four wells were used for each concentration in every time point. one set of untreated cells (0.1% DMSO) was kept as control for each time point. the % viable cell over control was plotted against respective concentrations of p-PD. two weeks later, when tumours were visible, i.p. injections of 2 and 4 mg/kg of p-PD were given to mice bearing melanoma tumours. cells derived from those p-PD treated tumours showed increased apoptosis. a meagre percentage of the human population is reported to be allergic to p-PD at a concentration of 1% or above. the concentration range of several standard anticancer drugs which are administered intravenously lies between 1 and 100 mM. p-PD is presumed to be very safe in reducing melanoma tumour mass in mice. in body weight gain/loss, weight of major organs, and haematological and biochemical parameters of the control and test groups shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Arrow and \u201c\u201d indicate the cleaved fragments of caspase 9 and caspase 9, respectively. caspase 8 inhibitor decreases number of dead A375 cells. cells were pretreated with the inhibitors of caspase 8 (a), caspase 9 (b), and PAN caspase (c) for two hours. this protective effect is either the |value of white bar + value of black bar| or the decrease in dead cell number as denoted by. flow cytometry results show that cells treated with 1 g/mL of p-PD for as low as 2 hours have undergone decrease in MMP. p-PD depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential of both melanoma cells. cell clusters that are high in PE fluorescence are gated in the top part of each dot plot. p-PD treatment increases the level of ROS in A375 cells. cells treated with p-PD for 16 hours were subjected to DCFH-DA stain. the percentage change of ROS was calculated using the expression 100/ROSControl.
