{"summary": "a number of geographic hosts of A. americanum ticks are infected by HRTV. the virus is closely related to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which is associated with hundreds of cases of severe disease. Gc is proposed to be located at the membrane-proximal portion of the complex according to the combination of electron microscopy (EM) data and crystal structure data of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) Gn, Gc, SFTSV Gn, and Puumala virus (PUUV) Gn (14, 15, 42) previously, two prefusion conformation structures of bunyavirus Gc from RVFV in the Phenuiviridae family and Hantaan virus the structure of two hantavirus Gc proteins (PUUV and HTNV) and one phenuivirus Gc (SFTSV) in the postfusion conformation has been determined. the rearrangement of -strand A0 that occurs during the fusogenic conformational change of phenuivirus Gc is similar to that of the flavivirus E protein (20, 21). this rearrangement among hantaviruses is unusual. domain II has an elongated shape with two subdomains, a six-stranded -sheet and a five-stranded -sandwich. domain III is an IgC-like module with a seven-stranded -sandwich. Glycans in domain III interact with residues in domain I. there are 27 cysteines in the crystallized Gc ectodomain, including 13 disulfide bonds and an unpaired cysteine (Cys621) in domain I. this cysteine pattern is partially conserved across phleboviruses. phenuivirus and hantavirus pivot 75.1\u00b0 and 132.6\u00b0 respectively. the hinge of domain II at the domain I/II junction between these two genera is almost the same, displaying 25.9\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 shifts. HTNV (magenta) and PUUV (yellow) Gc postfusion structures were superimposed on domain I. on the right, domain II pivots 25.9\u00b0 toward the domain I/II junction. angle between the two domain IIIs rotates 75.1\u00b0. all of the structures are displayed in cartoon representation. three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (N857, N918, and N940) are conserved in both HRTV and SFTSV Gc. in both the HRTV and SFTSV Gc structures, only one N-linked glycosylation (N940) in domain III can be observed. in the SFTSV Gc, only one N-GlcNAc can be observed. the postfusion Gc trimer exhibits different interprotomer interactions among bunyaviruses. hantavirus Gc (taking HRTV Gc as an example) -strand A0 is parallel to -strand B0 in the adjacent protomer. the fusogenic conformational change (22), the disulfide bond between C567 and C608, stabilizes the N terminus. no disulfide bond is formed at the N terminus of hantavirus Gc proteins. strand A0 therefore is more flexible for rearrangement. the conformations of the fusion loops show no difference between prefusion and postfusion states. there are three disulfide bonds in phlebovirus Gc, one of which links the loop and -strand, fixing the fusion loop's conformation. in hantavirus Gc, two disulfide bonds are located between loops, which is not as stable of a structure as the disulfide bonds in the Gc of HRTV, SFTSV, and RV database sequence accession numbers: HRTV, gb, AFP33394.1; SFTSV, gb, AGM33042.1; UUKV, gb, M17417.1; SFTV, gb, NC_015411; PPV, gb, HM566179; Palma virus (PALV), gb, JQ956380; Bhanja virus (BHAV), gb, JQ956377; TOSV, the structure of HRTV Gc was refined to 2.1- resolution (Table 1). the structure of HRTV Gc crystals was obtained at pH 4.5. a single trimer of HRTV Gc was observed in the asymmetric unit. there are 27 cysteines in the crystallized Gc ectodomain, including 13 disulfide bonds. an unpaired cysteine (Cys621) in domain I is partially conserved across phleboviruses. s608 is replaced by Cys608-Cys621. corresponding cysteine mutation assay results for SFTSV Gc (C617M) HTNV has a 310 helix (2) and a short -strand (k) instead. in domain III, the HTNV Gc has one -strand (G) more than the PUUV Gc at its C terminus. strand M0 in domain I is unique in phenuiviruses, which interacts with C0 in an antiparallel manner. color scheme is identical to that described for Fig. 1. three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in both HRTV and SFTSV Gc. in PUUV Gc, only the inner GlcNAc molecule of N-glycans in domain II interacts with N999 in domain III of the neighboring protomer. in HTNV Gc, only the inner GlcNAc molecule of N-glycans in domain II interacts with N999 in domain III of the adjacent protomer. hantavirus Gc (taking HTNV Gc as an example) is parallel to -strand B0 in the adjacent protomer. a similar phenomenon is also observed in RuV E1, which inserts the stem region into the neighboring molecule. phlebovirus Gc has more than one fusion loop in domain II. three loops (bc loop, cd loop, and ij loop) are obvious at the tip of domain II. in hantavirus Gc, two disulfide bonds are located between loops. the tip of domain II of the postfusion Gc from HRTV (A), SFTSV (B), PUUV (D), and HTNV (E) and the prefusion Gc from RVFV (C) and HTNV (F) are displayed in cartoon representation. the amino acid sequence alignment of the fusion loops among 13 phleboviruses. the ectodomain of HRTV shares 71% identity to SFTSV Gc. the overall structures between these two Gc proteins are identical. soluble HRTV Gc is monomeric in solution at both nonacidic pH and acid pH (5.0) the N-linked glycosylation sites of fusion proteins from alphaviruses (chikungunya virus, SFV, and Sindbis virus, and TBEV) are located in domain I and also contribute to the stabilization of the prefusion dimer conformation. however, the structures of SFTSV/HRTV Gc in its prefusion form or RVFV Gc in its postfusion form still are needed to understand phenuivirus Gc rearrangement during fusogenic conform histidines (H944 in HRTV, H1087 in RVFV, and H940 in SFTSV) that contribute to the stabilization are located in domain III. distinct features of Gc from either phenuiviruses or hantaviruses indicate newly defined family specificity. this calls for further structural work on other family members. c was purified from cell supernatants by metal affinity chromatography using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and then further purified using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. the protein fractions were concentrated to 5 mg/ml. codon-optimized synthetic DNA encoding the HRTV Gc ectodomain was cloned into the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) in frame with an amino-terminal gp67 signal peptide for secretion and a 6His tag. transfection and virus amplification were performed according to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system manual. initial restrained rigid-body refinement and manual model building were performed with REFMAC5 (38) and COOT (39), respectively. further refinement was performed with Phenix (41)."}
