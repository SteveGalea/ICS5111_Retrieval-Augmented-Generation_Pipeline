{"summary": "one host cell factor, REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage response-1), affects MV replication via regulation of mTORC1 [2] another host cell factor, KDELR2, was significantly increased upon the ectopic expression of A3G [2] ER chaperones GRP78/BiP, calreticulin, and calnexin have been shown to play an important role in the maturation and surface expression of MV-H in infected cells. ER stress is induced after the infection of cells with MV or canine distemper virus (CDV), or by ectopic viral glycoprotein expression. vero cells were transduced with the following vectors to generate transduced vero cells. human embryonic kidney 293T cells and vero cells were cultivated in DMEM medium containing 5 g/mL of puromycin [19] or FACS sorted based on DsRed2 fluorescence. natant virus was harvested together. cloned into pF6gW-DsRed. oligonucleotides were aligned and cloned into pF6gW-DsRed. two days after transfection, the supernatant was harvested and filter sterilized (0.4 m) the particle preparations were concentrated using Amicon\u00ae Ultra 100K centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and titrated. cells were infected with MV-eGFP at a MOI of 1 for 2 h. after 2 h, the virus inoculum was replaced by medium containing 200 M FIP. cells were stained with respective antibodies at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min to 1 h. d three times and stained with anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:400) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. staining was done using DAPI (1:1000), then slides were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) unoprecipitation, mock-treated and MV infected cells were lysed at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h with 1 mL of IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0 real time qPCRs were performed using the 2X SYBR Green qPCR Master mix (Bimake, Houston, TX, USA) the total RNA was isolated independently three times from control Vero 023 and Vero A3G cells using the GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA kit. transduced cells were grown under selection pressure with 5 g/mL of puromycin or FACS sorted based on DsRed2 fluorescence. human embryonic kidney 293T cells and vero cells were cultivated in DMEM medium containing 5 g/mL of puromycin [19] or FACS sorted based on DsRed2 fluorescence. oligonucleotides were aligned and cloned into the HpaI and XhoI sites of F6gW-DsRed. sequences of the clones were confirmed by sequencing. sequences of the clones were confirmed by sequencing. rabbit anti-KDELR2 (Sigma SAB1401554, St. Louis, MO, USA), rabbit anti-GAPDH (Santacruz sc-25778; Dallas, TX, USA), rabbit anti-GRP78 (Pierce, PA5-11418, Hubei, China), rabbit polyclonal anti MV-H cytoplasmic domain (Eurogentec, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium) cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.4% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide) cells were seeded on a NuncTM Lab-TekTM II Chamber Slide and infected a day later with recombinant MV at a MOI of 1 for 2 h. the viral inoculum was then replaced with media containing FIP throughout the in immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation Cells (5 106) were lysed at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h with 1 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 1.0% Igepal CA-630 (NP-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (DTT) cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. beads were then washed three times in IP buffer and three times in PBS. proteins were blotted semidry on nitrocellulose membranes. real time PCRs were performed using the 2X SYBR Green qPCR Master mix (Bimake, Houston, TX, USA ). Primers for KDELR2 were forward: 5\u2032 CTCTCTGCTGCGAAGT 3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032 ATGGAAAGCAGCCAAAACTC 3\u2032. a melting curve analysis was performed after each run to verify single PCR products. vero-KDELR2 cells, vero-A3G, and vero 023 cells were transduced with a KDELR2 expressing lentiviral vector. the titers of newly synthesized MV were determined after 1, 2, and 3 days. the titers of newly synthesized MV were determined after 1, 2, and 3 days. new tab The A3G upregulated gene KDELR2 reduces MV replication in vero cells. total RNA from vero 023 and vero A3G was isolated and reverse transcribed into cDNA. KDELR2-specific cDNA was then amplified using SYBR-Green real-time qPCR. KDELR2 reduces MV replication in CEM-SS T cells. transduced CEM-SS T cells were infected with MV-eGFP at a MOI of 0.1. the total MV-H expression was reduced by A3G, but not by KDELR2. KDELR2 over-expressing vero cells were infected with MV-eGFP at a MOI of 0.1 for 48 h. microscopically, the signals for KDELR2 and MV-H were clearly separated and did not reveal any co-localization at all time points after infection. findings suggest there is no direct interaction between KDELR2 and MV-H. Western blots were treated with antibodies to GRP78 (upper panel) or to Flag detecting KDELR2 and secondary antibodies as indicated (lower panel). calnexin, GRP78/Bip and calreticulin interact with MV envelope glycoproteins and support their transport to the cell surface. MV infection reduced this interaction (Figure 4C, lane 8) the interaction of KDELR2 with calnexin and GRP78 was confirmed. co-localization coefficients were 0.66 for calnexin, 0.75 for GRP78, and 0.54 for calreticulin. the subcellular localization of the chaperones calnexin (C), GRP78 (D) and calreticulin (E) in comparison to KDELR2-Flag and nuclei (DAPI) was analyzed using a confocal microscope (enlargement 1000; size bar = 20 m). qPCR showed a tendency of increased KDELR2 mRNA expression in vero-A3G cells 1.3-fold [2] (Figure 1B, lane shRNA treated cells express less KDELR2 than vero-023 cells. this is probably due to the fact that shRNA treated cells express less KDELR2 than vero-023 cells. this is probably due to the fact that shRNA treated cells express less KDELR2 than vero-023 cells. significance was calculated using the Student\u2019s t test (** p 0.01) significance was calculated using the Student\u2019s t test (** p 0.01). KDELR2 reduces MV-H surface expression in MV-infected vero-023, vero-A3G, and KDELR2 over-expressing cells. MV-H surface expression was significantly reduced by 35% and 32% on vero-A3G and KDELR2 expressing cells. total MV-F expression was reduced by approximately 20% on the vero-A3G cells. data of mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) were presented as a percent of control normalized to values of Vero-023 cells. results of three experiments are summarized in bar graphs (B,D) lysates of MV-infected and uninfected (as indicated) vero-023 and vero-KDELR2-Flag (KD) cells remained untreated (input, lanes 2 to 5) or were treated with anti-Flag antibody-conjugated beads for precipitation (IP: anti-Flag, lanes 6 to 9) Western blots were treated with antibodies to GRP78 (upper panel), or to Flag detecting KDELR2 surface expression of the chaperones calnexin, GRP78, and calreticulin was analyzed by flow cytometry in the control and KDELR2 over-expressing cells in the presence and absence of MV infection. quantification of the total expression of the chaperones revealed only a tendency of reduced expression in response to KDELR2 over-expression. KDELR2 over-expressing Vero cells (KDELR2) remained uninfected (open columns) or were infected with MV-eGFP for 48 h at a MOI of 0.1 (grey columns) cells were stained after fixation (surface, A), and after fixation and permeabilization (total, B) with antibodies to calnexin, GRP78, and calreticulin as indicated. eGFP-positive cells were evaluated as terminal amino acids KDEL are located in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi. they catch KDEL-bearing proteins escaping from the ER and re-transport them to the ER lumen. in the trans-Golgi network, prM is cleaved by cellular proteases. in the case of the vaccinia virus, similar mechanisms may occur. a higher concentration of KDELR2 leads to the retention of an increased fraction of calnexin and GRP78 in the ER. this also suggests that a higher concentration of KDELR2 leads to the retention of an increased fraction of calnexin and GRP78 in the ER. this also suggests that a higher concentration of KDELR2 leads to the retention of an increased fraction of calnexin and GRP78 in the ER. induction of A3G in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), IL-2, and type I interferon also leads to increased KDELR2 expression. the investigation of A3G-dependent consequences for host factor expression such as KDELR2 requires the ectopic expression of A3G and/or specific inhibition by interfering RNA."}
