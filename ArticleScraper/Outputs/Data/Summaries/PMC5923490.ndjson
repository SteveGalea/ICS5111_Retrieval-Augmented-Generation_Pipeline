{"summary": "IFNs are typically induced by the activation of host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), mainly retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLR) and Toll-like receptors (TLR) during viral infection [1,2]. to date, three types of IFNs (mainly IFN-/) have been characterized. triggering of the pathway result in expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). the pathway was initially characterized based on its role in type I IFN-mediated responses [16]. the STAT proteins have also been shown to be critical for transmission of signals of many diverse membrane receptors. all JAKs are characterized by a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain, and a related, but enzymatically inactive pseudokinase or kinase-like domain. the pseudokinase domain is thought to regulate JAKs kinase activity by interacting with the kinase domain. bioinformatics analysis suggests a remarkable similarity among STAT genes, with the exception of STAT2 [28]. all STATs share a similar structure comprised of the following domains. STAT1 and STAT2 are the major players involved in type I IFN-mediated signaling. other complexes induced by type I IFNs include homodimers for STAT1 to STAT6, and heterodimers, including STAT1-STAT3, STAT1-STAT4, STAT1-STAT5, STAT2-STAT3, and STAT5\u2013STAT6. the STAT3 was the first well-characterized unphosphorylated STAT (U-STAT) in mammalian cells. it was due to its constant trafficking into the nucleus in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. however, in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, STATs still perform unique functions by constantly shutting between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. a half hour, but steadily decreased after two hours, and to basal levels by eight hours. expression of ISGs could last far longer than 24 h after high dose IFN- treatment. if cells were stimulated with low dose IFN- (5 U/mL), expression of ISGs increased after six hours and persisted after 48 or 72 h. some U-ISGF3-induced proteins are capable to mediate resistance to DNA damage in many cancers in which U-ISGF3 is overexpressed. STAT2 and IRF9 can form complexes as well, and direct a prolonged ISGF3-like transcriptional response to achieve antiviral activity in the absence of STAT1 [57] NF-B response elements come into play after U-STAT3/U-NF-B trafficking to the nucleus that depends on the presence of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of STAT3. tyrosine-unphosphorylated STAT5 (U-STAT5) has been reported to restrain megakaryocytic differentiation and activation of a canonical pSTAT5 response. phosphorylation of serine 727 (S727) in STAT1-TAD occurs only on promoter-bound STAT1 [65], which is similar to IL-6-induced S727-phosphorylation of STAT3 [66]. cytokine-induced phosphorylation of STATs is accomplished by components of the general transcription machinery that are assembled at the promoter. pSTAT1 (S727) promotes specific expression of ISGs. in vivo function of serine monophosphorylation within the TAD of STATs has been exclusively investigated for STAT1. previous studies in Stat1/ cells demonstrated the occurrence of STAT1-independent, STAT2-dependent gene expression is a delayed event during the transcriptional response to type I IFNs. NK cells derived from Stat1-S727A mice show significantly higher cytotoxicity against a range of tumor cells. phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 plays a role in a cell-specific manner. current understanding of tyrosine phosphorylation-independent non-canonical STATs activation remains limited. kinase inhibitors as targeted drugs for cancer therapy have shown that inhibition of CDK8 kinase can result in decreased phosphorylation of STAT1 at S727 in a variety of cancer cells. phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 could serve as a biomarker of CDK8 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. the pseudokinase domain is thought to regulate JAKs kinase activity by interacting with the kinase domain, which is responsible for JAKs basal activity [26,27]. in mammalian species, there are seven members (encoded by individual gene) of the STAT family: STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, and 6 [28]. JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues located in the cytokine-receptor cytoplasmic domains to provide binding sites for STATs SH2 domains. STATs are then phosphorylated by JAKs on tyrosine residues around amino acid (aa) 700, depending on the length of a particular STAT. phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine residue Y701 only leads to formation of STAT1 homodimers, also known as -interferon activation factor (GAF) the interaction of STAT1 and KPNA1 involves a non-classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) a series of mutations and deletions has revealed a region within the coiled-coil domain of STAT5A is critical for nuclear import of unphosphorylated STAT5A. the functions of U-STATs have been extensively investigated for STAT1 and STAT2 since these STATs have been linked to IFN-mediated signaling. phosphorylated ISGF3 formation requires high levels of IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. phosphorylated ISGF3 formation requires high levels of IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. the exact function of U-ISGF3 still requires further investigation. STAT2 mediates innate immunity in the absence of STAT1 [58]. this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that STAT2 mediates innate immunity in the absence of STAT1 [58]. nuclear U-STAT3 accumulation correlates with a poor prognosis for human glioblastoma [62], suggesting an important role of U-STAT3 in oncogenesis [63]. tyrosine-unphosphorylated STAT5 (U-STAT5) has been reported to restrain megakaryocytic differentiation and activation of a canonical pSTAT5-driven response. cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is the kinase responsible for IFN-induced STAT1-Ser727 phosphorylation inside the nucleus. siRNA-mediated silencing of CDK8 renders cells more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus infection. a recent study also showed diptoindonesin G-induced extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinases (ERK)-mediated phosphoryl cells demonstrated the occurrence of STAT1-independent, STAT2-dependent gene expression is a delayed event during the transcriptional response to type I IFNs. intriguingly, in vivo data from STAT1-Y701F mice demonstrated that the presence of STAT1 (Y701F) partially repressed STAT2/IRF9-dependent, STAT1-independent ISG expression during the late stages of the IFN- response. macrophages obtained from ST previous studies focusing on U-STATs mainly investigated phosphorylation of tyrosine. however, it is not known if U-STATs or components of U-ISGF3 are completely unphosphorylated at both tyrosine and serine residues. the link between U-STATs and serine monophosphorylation of STATs remains elusive. studies from gain-of-function mutations suggest increased and prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 is observed in response to IL-6 and IL-21 [80]. STAT2 appears unable to bind to DNA directly [81,82] but contributes a potent transactivation as a component of ISGF3. IL-10 is known largely for its role in induction of acute phase proteins. IL-6 contributes to inflammation, whereas IL-10 blocks inflammation. it is possible that STAT3 is not the only STAT activated by IL-6 or IL-10. STAT3 was initially identified through screening for STAT homologues. expression of STAT4 was found to be limited to myeloid cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes [94,95] expression of STAT4 was found to be limited to myeloid cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. STAT4 deficiency in mice causes failure to induce lung Th2 or Th17 immunity upon RSV challenge. a recent study showed that STAT4 deficiency in mice causes a failure to induce lung Th2 or Th17 immunity upon RSV challenge. STAT5A single knockout mice are predominately defective in prolactin (RPL)-dependent mammary gland development, while STAT5B single knockout mice exhibit defects similar to those observed in GH receptor-deficient mice [85]. a recent report shows that STAT5B is a dominant player in both effector and regulatory responses. STAT6 plays an important role in regulating acquired immunity involving IL-4 secretion by activated T and B lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils. in STAT6-deficient mice, IL-4-induced signaling in lymphocytes is impaired, and is unable to induce upregulation of class II MHC expression and CD23. it has been demonstrated that STAT6 regulates lung inflammatory responses in a JAK-independent manner. PIAS family proteins are currently known as Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) E3 ligases. PIAS proteins negatively regulate activation of STATs after binding to them. PIAS proteins only interact with the STAT dimer, which indicates that only phosphorylated STATs can interact with PIAS. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are the major inhibitors for type I IFN-mediated signaling [139]. kinase inhibitory region (KIR) inhibits kinase activity of JAKs via different mechanisms, such as blocking of STAT recruitment to cytokine receptors, targeting of STATs for proteasome degradation, binding to JAKs, and targeting JAKs for proteasome degradation. acetylation of STATs is dependent on the balance between histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases (HATs). acetylation of STATs can occur at various lysine residues located within different domains that include the DNA-binding, SH2, N-terminal, and C-terminal domains. methylation at R27 of STAT6 is necessary for optimal STAT6 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding activity. new methylation site in STAT1 (K525) has been identified, and is required for STAT1-mediated antiviral immunity. a recent study showed that inhibition of HDAC enhances STAT acetylation but blocks NF-B signaling during renal inflammation and fibrosis in haplotype Npr1+/ male mice. crosstalk between the JAK/STAT and NF-B pathways under the same PTM conditions is complicated. there has been little investigational focus on this issue. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is known for its ability to inhibit both IFN induction and IFN-activated JAK/STAT signaling. for a long time, the antagonism for both IFN induction and IFN-activated signaling by PRRSV was considered to contribute PRRSV virulence and pathogenesis. the attenuated HuN4-F112 vaccine strain induced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. this result indicates that HP-PRRSV-HuN4 may enhance inflammation. however, the attenuated HuN4-F112 strain induced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines that enhanced immune responses against infection. serine monophosphorylation of STAT1 appears to be linked to PRRSV virulence. virulent strain VR2385 strongly induces serine monophosphorylation of STAT1. expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promoted by IFN-independent monophosphorylation of STAT1 comprises an alternative explanation for the cytokine storm observed during HP-PRRSV infection. authors postulated that serine monophosphorylated STAT1 could be employed by EBV as an alternative strategy to override the antiviral response evoked by IFNs. in another study, it had been shown that an early lytic protein encoded by EBV is capable of specifically promoting the expression of several ISGs that are known to be strongly induced by IFN in the absence of IFN induction. HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system leads to HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). it is fueled by viral infection and immune activation of brain mononuclear phagocytes. it was believed that HIV-1 activates pro-inflammatory and IFN-inducible genes in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. othelial cells induces consecutive phosphorylation of STAT3 at serine 727. phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 is transient. tyrosine phosphorylation is absent for STAT3. most virus-encoded antagonists block canonical JAK/STAT activation. some viruses are still capable of inducing expression of ISGs or other inflammation responses. but it remains unknown whether virus-induced serine monophosphorylation is common to all STATs. STAT3 is an IL-6-dependent transcription factor that promotes acute phase gene expression. it is now known that STAT3 transduces signals for the entire IL-6 family. IL-6 contributes to inflammation, whereas IL-10 blocks inflammation. lysosome-mediated cell death in the mammary gland during post-lactational regression in vivo. some reports suggest an involvement of STAT3 in the IFN-mediated antiviral response. expression of STAT4 was found to be limited to myeloid cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. STAT4 activation requires the presence of activated STAT2 [99] instead of being directly recruited to the IFN- receptor complex, STAT4 is indirectly recruited by a mechanism involving STAT2 [99]. STAT4 has highly specific functions, as observed in STAT4-deficient mice. STAT5 proteins are activated by various cytokines and other factors. STAT5A single knockout mice are predominately defective in prolactin-dependent mammary gland development. STAT5B single knockout mice exhibit defects similar to those observed in GH receptor-deficient mice. a recent report shows that STAT5B is a dominant player in both effector and regulatory responses, suggesting that it is necessary for immunological tolerance. STAT6 was originally identified from cellular extracts as an IL-4-stimulated STAT, and was soon shown to be activated by IL-13 as well [112,113] PIAS proteins are encoded by four genes: PIAS1, PIAS2 (also known as PIASx), PIAS3, and PIAS4 (also known as PIASy) PIAS family proteins are currently known as small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) E3 ligases [121,122,123] and all PIAS family members appear to regulate STAT signaling [120] CIS (cytokine-induced SH2 domain-containing protein) is critical for proteasome-mediated degradation of SOCS-associated proteins. SOCS1 and SOCS3 contain an kinase inhibitory region (KIR) that inhibits kinase activity of JAKs. tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) dephosphorylate pTyr residues in the JAK/TYK activation loop or phosphorylation sites within cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors. post-translation modification (PTM) has been shown to regulate STATs activation. acetylation of STATs depends on balance between histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltrans arginine 31 (R31) methylation was shown to be required for transcriptional activation. inhibition of STAT1 methylation at R27 of STAT6 negatively regulates STAT1 activation. methylation at R27 of STAT6 is necessary for optimal STAT6 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding activity. in vitro and in vivo data indicate that ISGylation is a positive regulator of IFN signaling. crosstalk between methylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation is still not understood. crosstalk between the JAK/STAT and NF-B pathways under the same PTM conditions is complicated. almost all viruses examined so far encode antagonists for the JAK/STAT pathways, as well as for IFN induction or NF-B-mediated signaling. a mystery that cannot be fully explained regarding the interaction between virus and host signaling is how virus induces an inflammatory response while concurrently generating antagonists of both downstream and downstream IFN signaling. HP-PRRSV-HuN4 induced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. this result indicates that HP-PRRSV-HuN4 may enhance inflammation to cause more damage to tissues and organs. however, the attenuated HuN4-F112 strain induced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines that enhanced immune responses against infection. HP-PRRSV infection in pigs is characterized by aberrant expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a robust inflammatory response [169,171] p38 MAP kinase pathway is kinase-specific inhibitor. virulent strain VR2385 strongly induces serine monophosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the first virus reported to induce serine monophosphorylation of STAT1 during infection. serine monophosphorylated STAT1 is able to bind DNA in EBV-infected cells. however, this earlier study did not offer a clear linkage between DNA-bound STAT1 and evaluated expression of genes normally responsive to STAT1. serine monophosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were both observed in HIV-1-infected HBMECs. a specific STAT1 inhibitor blocked HIV-1 induced serine monophosphorylation of STAT1 and thus decreased IL-6 expression and secretion. studies on sarcoma-associated herpesvirus demonstrated that latent protein kaposin B promotes serine monophosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation at Y705 [183]. compared to STAT1, evidence suggests that serine monophosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 is activated by MAP kinase 2 (MAP2K2). it is still unknown if other STATs could have monophosphorylation of serine residues at TAD domains. it is also notable that available data implies a correlation between viral-induced serine monophosphorylation of STATs (STAT1 and STAT3) and pro-inflammatory responses caused by virus infection. IFN types and subtypes appear redundant in their functions due to the activation of common downstream JAK/STAT pathway. elucidation of ISG functions is also of interest, as most ISGs are not well-defined. crosstalk between the JAK/STAT pathway and other signaling pathways also requires further study."}
