{"summary": "children were admitted into wards of the departments of Respiratory Medicine, Infectious Diseases, and Emergency Medicine and the pediatric intensive care unit of Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital. we recruited children 28 days\u201313 years of age who had symptoms of acute infection, defined as fever (body temperature 38.0\u00b0C) or hypothermia (body temperature 35.5\u00b0C), leukocytosis (leukocyte count >15,000 cells/mL for children 5 years of age or >11,000 cells/mL nasopharyngeal aspirates transferred into aliquots and stored them at 80\u00b0C. we collected demographic data (sex and age), epidemiologic data (date of illness onset and history of prematurity) and clinical data (signs, symptoms, and concurrent medical conditions) Statistical Analysis We fitted a logistic regression model (with sine and cosine functions of the illness onset week) to individual patient data and retained a seasonal curve as described previously. we defined the RSV season as consecutive weeks during which the percentage of tests positive for RSV per week exceeded a threshold of 10%. we excluded children known to be immunosuppressed. children known to be immunosuppressed had received a solid organ transplant. human coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) collected demographic data (sex and age), epidemiologic data (date of illness onset and history of prematurity) and clinical data (signs, symptoms, and concurrent medical conditions) congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic lung disease (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia), moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin 90 g/L), and malnutrition. we introduced a pair of sine and cosine functions of illness onset week into the model. we modeled age and year using a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots (22) we also introduced into the model other factors that differed significantly. cases of pneumonia and RSV infection in hospitalized children 28 days\u201313 years of age, by month, by month, by month, Beijing, China, July 1, 2007\u2013June 30, 2015, by respiratory syncytial virus year*. we assigned 2013\u201314 as an RSV-B\u2013dominant season for the purposes of modeling. orange vertical lines denote the Chinese Spring Festival. age group, mo 0.001 1\u20135 304 (42) 228 (33) 210 (40) 140 (22) 147 (30) 108 (25) 38 (9) 60 (21) 6\u201311 127 (18) 154 (22) 89 (17) 84 (13) 68 (14) 60 (14) 28 (7) 28 (10) 12\u201323 54 (8) 94 (14) 71 (14) 71 (14) 104 (16) 69 (14) 48 (11) 39 (9) 19 (7) 24\u201359 78 (1 overall, RSV was identified in 1,270 (30%) children among the enrolled cohort. a sharp decrease in sample number and samples positive for RSV-B were observed each year. the proportion increased to 61%\u201367% in RSV-A\u2013dominant years (2007\u201308, 2010\u201311, and 2011\u201312) but was 50% in RSV-B\u2013dominant years (Figure 2, panel B). hospitalized children with pneumonia testing positive for RSV, by age group, calendar season, and RSV subgroup. all 8 deceased children were born at term, and only 2 had concurrent medical conditions at hospital admission (1 CHD, 1 IgA nephropathy) the percentage of PCR tests positive for RSV varies by study year. the average season onset occurred at calendar week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 (mid-May) the peak of RSV activity occurred at calendar week 3 (mid-january).

RSV activity in 2007\u201308, 2011\u201312, and 2014\u201315 (RSV-A\u2013dominant years) peaked early (during calendar week 1) and in 2009\u201310 and 2013\u201314 (RSV-B\u2013dominant years) peaked late (calendar week 7, in February) in general, the RSV season started earlier (RSV-A week 40 vs. RSV-B week 45), lasted longer (RSV-A 34 weeks vs. RSV-B 2013\u201314 was defined as consecutive weeks during which the percentage of RSV-specific PCRs testing positive per week exceeded a 10% threshold. children who were ill during the 2007\u201308, 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and 2014\u201315 seasons (n = 2,145) were included in a model to give an average estimate of RSV seasonal characteristics for RSV-A\u2013dominant seasons. a seasonal curve is superimposed onto the graph. a seasonal curve is superimposed onto the graph. RSV season was defined as consecutive weeks during which the percentage of RSV-specific PCRs testing positive per week exceeded a 10% threshold. on average the RSV season starts at calendar week 41 (mid-October) and lasts 33 weeks through week 20 of the next year (mid-May) 97% of total RSV-positive PCRs occur during this period. 62 RSV vaccine candidates are under development, and 19 are undergoing clinical trials. the number of children admitted with pneumonia dropped from 718 in the first year to 282 in the last. in the first study year, more children 28 days\u20135 months of age (42%) were enrolled. in the last, more children >5 years of age (43%) were enrolled. season onset and peak in RSV-A\u2013prevailing years occurred 3\u20135 weeks earlier and duration was 6 weeks longer than those observed in RSV-B\u2013prevailing years. the effect of year diminished when RSV-A\u2013prevailing year was adjusted for as a factor in the model, suggesting that repeated shifting between RSV-A and RSV-B might play a key role in driving RSV transmission dynamics in populations. children who were in their first months of life had the highest risk for RSV infection (3,30) administration of 1 dose of palivizumab each month for 5 months has been recommended to protect children at high risk for severe respiratory infection. one third of children in our study with pneumonia requiring hospitalization had RSV infection. the case definition used in our study was suboptimal, and we might have missed some children infected with RSV. the prevailing RSV subgroup in a given season appears to affect the timing of RSV activity."}
