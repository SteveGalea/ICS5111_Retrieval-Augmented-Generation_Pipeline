{"summary": "human activities have produced since the mid-19th century, an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere and an increase in average temperature without comparison in human history. the rate of change in climate is faster now than in any other period in the past thousand years. changes in climate until 2100 foresee including higher maximum temperature and more hot days, and higher minimum temperature and fewer cold days. droughts or dryness, changes in intensity, frequency, and duration of tropical cyclone activity, as likely, excluding tsunami. a great attention has been given to the relationship between climate change and rising risk of infectious diseases, mostly to the vector-borne infections. for 2025, 64% of the world's population will live in water-stressed basins. the variation in the amount and intensity of rainfall will have an overall negative impact on agriculture. rising temperature is not the only cause of soil aridity; exploitation of the environment, deforestation and loss of biodiversity are also important contributing factors. effects Reduced availability of water Conflicts Drying up the soil, alterations and shrinking arable land Malnutrition Pollution Chronic illness, toxic substances in the food chain Habitats suitable to pathogens Water-borne diseases, vector-borne diseases Effect of extreme weather events. a single extreme event cannot generally be directly attributed to anthropogenic influence. the effects of drought is manifested in an immediate way on the populations of the poorest countries. the loss of crops or livestock has an immediate consequence on the nutritional status of the population, causing malnutrition, under-nutrition, and compromised childhood development due to decline in local agriculture. the damage to agriculture could indirectly affect distant countries from the concerned regions. the loss of about one-third of the grain produced due to the extreme heat and fires during the summer 2010 in western Russia has increased the price of the wheat worldwide. patients suffering from asthma are more hospitalized during extreme heat and precipitation events. it has been hypothesized that thunderstorm events or periods of heavy rainfall and intense wind can trigger the release of fungal spores. cholera outbreaks occur in Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya almost every year since 1977. the incidence of cholera greatly increases during years of El Nio warm events. events cause changes in sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean, impact the Walker Circulation, and displace the convective area. climate change scenarios include a change in the distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extremes. by 2030, 10% more diarrheal diseases are expected, affecting primarily the young children. pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change. they spend a good part of their life cycle in an ectothermic invertebrate host. a warmer climate presents a more favorable condition for survival and survival of the vector. in recent decades, outbreaks of malaria have been reported from many mountainous regions of Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. a high degree of temporal and spatial variation in the climate of East Africa suggests further that claimed associations between local malaria resurgence and regional changes in climate are overly simplistic. transmission of dengue fever and chikungunya, both carried by the mosquito Aedes albopictus, has been described in Europe and the USA. the presence of a vector has allowed the transmission to local population. recently, Zika virus has emerged as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d. encephalitis has been linked to milder and shorter winters and the consequent extension of the period of tick activity. the abandoning of agricultural lands would also be considered, which has allowed the proliferation of rodents reservoir and the establishment of ecological niches suitable to ticks in urban parks. climate change is one of the main environmental and health equity challenges of our time. many of the health impacts of climate are a particular threat to poor people in low- and middle-income countries. many of the health impacts of climate are a particular threat to poor people in low- and middle-income countries. health system needs to strengthen primary health care, develop preventive programs, put special attention towards the vulnerable communities and regions. to prevent the spread of infectious and vector-borne diseases, it would be necessary to establish an integrated notification network of veterinary, entomological and human survey."}
