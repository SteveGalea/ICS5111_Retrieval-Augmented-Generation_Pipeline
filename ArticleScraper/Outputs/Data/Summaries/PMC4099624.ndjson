{"summary": "20% of patients require oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation in an ICU for respiratory failure and ARDS [2]. CT was performed in late-stage ARDS (more than 2 weeks after onset of ARDS) and after discharge from hospital in survivors. results All mechanically ventilated patients received prolonged mechanical ventilation (over 14 days), one was only ventilated for 72 hours, and two patients were not ventilated at all. no apparent differences between patients who received prolonged mechanical ventilation and those who did not. patients who received prolonged mechanical ventilation do not seem to resolve significantly after discharge."}
