{"summary": "Sir Hans Sloane was a polymath with an extraordinary range of interests even for a man of the Enlightenment. he became personal physician to the families of three British monarchs, queen Anne, George I and George II, a man of public affairs and a philanthropist. Sir Hans Sloane is best remembered as the founder of the British Museum. he left his personal collections to the Crown on the provision that they would be well housed and curated for the benefit of the public. he donated the land on which the Physick Garden stands in Chelsea to the Apothecaries' Society. Sloane's 'Account of inoculation' was 'given to Mr Ranby, to be published, anno 1736' it was not published until 1755, just over a year after Sloane's death. the paper acknowledges that promulgation of inoculation owed much to two remarkable women. the ethics of enrolment into clinical trials may have changed since those days. the concept of step by step inquiry from safety to efficacy remains unchanged. in 1712, she escaped from an arranged marriage intended by her father by eloping with and marrying Sir Edward Wortley Montagu. 'tis the women's coffee house, where all the news of the town is told, scandal invented, &c. lady Mary's brother died of smallpox in 1715. when she herself suffered from the disease in 1715 she developed severe pock marks on her face and regretted the loss of her famed beauty. in another letter, she tells of the inoculation against smallpox. in 1721, it was so warm that roses bloomed in January and smallpox \u2018went forth like a Destroying Angel\u2019. inoculating the royal children without ill effect made variolation widely acceptable among the English aristocracy and gentry. in france, it was thought to be reckless and Voltaire commented on the difference in attitudes between the two nations with characteristic acuity. the town of Milton, now part of the Greater Boston, was the first to act in a corporative capacity to extend the benefits of vaccination to all its citizens. in 1809, 337 people of different ages and conditions were vaccinated, and 12 of them were afterward tested for inoculation of the smallpox and found to be fully protected. a table in Benjamin Waterhouse's 1809 tract on protection against smallpox in Milton, MA compared risks with the benefits of being variolated or vaccinated. Voltaire spent nearly three years in exile in 1726\u20131728. he relished the greater freedom of speech than that allowed in Paris. in 1774, at the age of 64, Louis XV died of smallpox in the palace of Versailles. in 1767 her mother, the Empress Marie Theresa of Austria, promoted variolation in Austria after recovering from severe smallpox. in 1767 her mother, the Empress Marie Theresa of Austria, promoted variolation in Austria after recovering from severe smallpox. smallpox smallpox is a relatively recent disease of humankind. it was not until the 1890s that filterable viruses were first distinguished from bacteria retained by porous filters. the story of the rise and fall of smallpox is told by Frank Fenner and the pioneers of eradication. the lack of an animal reservoir, combined with the appearance of obvious signs of infection, allowed the containment and eventual eradication of smallpox as a naturally occurring disease. there are no records of a smallpox-like disease in the Bible or Greco-Roman writings. the proximate animal precursor to variola virus remains uncertain. phylogenetic analysis of the DNA genome of the virus reveals a close similarity to camelpox virus [19] but also to a poxvirus isolated from the west African rodent, the Tatera gerbil [16,20]. smallpox (Variola major) was first recorded in eastasia around 1700 years ago. it is likely to have originated there around 1700 years ago. no further field investigations of rodent variola-like viruses have been made. naive populations had never experienced smallpox because their ancestors crossed the Bering Strait before it emerged in humans. high mortality observed in the first american epidemics could have been exacerbated by the genetic constitution of the affected population. without the devastating effect of smallpox, there would not have been an estimated 85\u201390% fall in the population of indigenous Americans during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. in 1996, on the 200th anniversary of Jenner's experiment into vaccination, the WHO voted to destroy variola. this deliberate extinction of a species has yet to be carried out and may be delayed indefinitely. the practice is so innocent and so sure that out of an hundred persons inoculated not two die, whereas on the contrary out of an hundred persons that are infected in the natural way there die commonly about thirty. it is practiced not only by the inhabitants of the towns, but also by the wild Arabs' [nomads] inoculation of cowpox protected against smallpox in 1796. he vaccinated an eight year old boy named James Phipps. six weeks later, variolation of the child was attempted without any evidence of infection. two reviewers suggested that Banks' rejection of the paper had to do with the \u2018paucity of experimental proof in the original paper\u2019. somerville pointed him to another country physician, a Dr Dolland, who confirmed Jenner's thesis about the efficacy of vaccination. as early as 1801 he predicted that \u2018the annihilation of the Small Pox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice\u2019. \u2018May I go with you, my pretty maid\u2019 \u2018you're kindly welcome, sir\u2019 she said. the cuckoo chick ejecting its non-genetic \u2018siblings' from its foster nest must have been noted by observant country folk. the cuckoo chick ejecting its non-genetic \u2018siblings' from its foster nest must have been noted. the real nature of the smallpox vaccine remains a puzzle to this day. it was assumed to be cowpox, but in the mid-twentieth century it became clear that vaccinia stocks were biologically different from cowpox. both cowpox and horsepox were used during the nineteenth century to vaccinate against smallpox, and some strains of vaccinia may be derived from horsepox. a large number of specific microorganisms were identified in the aetiology of different infectious diseases, and attempts were made to develop immunization against those diseases. in 1881, Louis Pasteur presented his work on the use of attenuated microorganisms to protect against two animal diseases (chicken cholera and anthrax) the use of 'vaccinators' as a cover for tracking down osama bin Laden in Pakistan has also hindered the polio endgame. vaccines are considered to be the most cost-effective public health interventions. between 2 and 3 million children in developing countries are spared from death every year. variolation and vaccination coexisted in the uk until at least 1840, when variolation was outlawed by the Vaccination Act of that year. despite the inherent value of variolation, modern vaccinologists often consider variolation only as a procedure that facilitated the introduction of vaccination. Robin Weiss is an Emeritus Professor of Viral Oncology at university college London. he studied at uCL and worked in india, Czechoslovakia and USA. he is noted for discovering \u2018fossil\u2019 retroviral genomes in normal host DNA and that CD4 is the HIV receptor. from 1986 to 2004, he worked at the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC) he promoted the international development and testing of vaccines against HIV/AIDS. in 1968, Esparza received his MD degree in Venezuela and in 1974 a PhD in Virology and Cell Biology from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas."}
