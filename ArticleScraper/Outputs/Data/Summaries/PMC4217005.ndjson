{"summary": "the most recently discovered protein to be classified as an IFN is IFN-4 (gene symbol: IFNL4) we found the IFNL4 gene and the IFN-4 protein through genetic and genomic studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. we discuss questions that should be addressed to resolve its paradoxical biologic activities. the proteins encoded by these 3 genes, IFN-1, IFN-2 and IFN-3, are highly similar to each other. the amino-acid identity between IFN-1 and IFN-3 is 96%. the identity between IFN-1 and IFN-2/-3 is 81%. type III IFNs have a more limited functional range than the type I IFNs (IFN-/), whose receptors are widely expressed on most somatic cell types. type III IFNs may have evolved specifically to render protection to the epithelium. the genes induced by type III IFNs appear to be the same as those induced by IFN- (Doyle and others 2006; Marcello and others 2006) the downstream biological activities induced by either group appear to be very similar. viral infection studies have shown that type III IFNs play a more prominent role than type I IFNs in mediating antiviral protection against certain types of viral infections. recombinant IFN-1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C indicates its antiviral effects are similar to recombinant IFN-1. a genotype for the rs12979860 SNP (located 3 kb upstream of IFNL3) was reported to be the host factor that was most strongly associated with a response to treatment with pegylated IFN- and ribavirin. individuals who carried the rs12979860-T allele (ie, C/T and T/T genotypes) were less likely to respond to treatment than those with 2 copies of the rs1297986 rs12979860-T allele was associated with a poorer treatment response. rs12979860-T, as well as the strongly linked rs8099917-G allele, was also associated with lower intrahepatic expression of ISGs before treatment. some of the SNPs near IFNL3 that are in strong LD with rs12979860 are potentially functional. a nonsynonymous coding variant in IFNL3 (rs8103142, Arg70Lys) does not appear to alter the potency or function of IFN-3 (Urban and others 2010). rs4803217 polymorphism lies in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of IFNL3 and is in strong LD with rs12979860. IFNL4 is controlled by a heritable (germline) dinucleotide frameshift variant. the alternative allele at this locus does not create IFN-4. IFNL4-G is a functional variant that controls the generation of IFN-4. LD between IFNL4-G and IFNL4 rs12979860-T is very high for Asians (r2=1.0) and Europeans (r2>0.9) in these racial groups IFNL4-G and IFNL4 rs12979860-T almost always are inherited together. IFNL4 rs12979860 genotypes yield similar or identical results. response to treatment with pegylated IFN- and ribavirin is more strongly associated with a genotype for IFNL4-G than IFNL4 rs12979860 among Europeans. IFN-4 is very distinct from IFN-1, 2, and 3 in the D helix. it is predicted binding region for the IL-10R2 chain, the second chain of the IFN- receptor complex. independent work from 2 groups indicates that IFN-4 can signal through the IFN- receptor complex. hepG2-ISRE-Luc cells were transfected with an IFNL4 expression construct. either silencing of IFN-R1 by siRNA or blocking of IL-10R2 with an anti-IL-10R2 antibody inhibited IFN-4 signaling. the cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs for Renilla and Firefly. IFN-4 and IFN-3 exhibited comparable potency when assayed for their ability to induce antiviral activity against 2 different human coronaviruses. similar antiviral activity observed for IFN-3 and IFN-4 is also noteworthy, because it is more potent than IFN-1 or IFN-2. IFNL4 expression can be examined via an assay that measures both JN806234 (ie, the IFNL4-G transcript that generates full-length protein) it is possible to use \u201callele-specific\u201d assays that differentiate all transcripts which include the IFNL4-TT allele from all transcripts that include the IFNL4-TT allele. a and others detected higher ISG expression in carriers of the IFNL4\u2013G allele compared with those with the IFNL4\u2013TT/TT genotype. hepatic expression of IFNL4 and ISGs was significantly lower in patients who achieved SVR compared with those who did not. pretreating mice with IFN-2 induced a state of refractoriness to a secondary challenge with IFN- but not to IFN-1. some recent studies have examined the potential cross-regulatory effects of IFN- on IFN- responsiveness. samples that carried IFNL4 rs12979860-T suggest that IFN-4 impairs HCV clearance via a mechanism involving up-regulation of IFN-R1. these results suggest that IFN-4 may impair the antiviral program required for effective HCV clearance. the impaired secretion of IFN-4 might be due to inefficient post-translational glycosylation. if IFN-4 is not efficiently secreted, this protein could conceivably become extracellular within the liver as a result of cell lysis. the chromosomal region harboring IFNL4 was the most highly selected human IFN region. it seems unlikely that this selection was driven by HCV. however, risk factors that account for the bulk of HCV transmission arose primarily in the twentieth century. IFN-4 and IFN-3 signal through IFN- receptor complex, activate the JAK-STAT pathway to induce ISGs, and exhibit strong antiviral activity in vitro. there is now strong evidence that IFN-4 signals through the IFN-R1/IL-10R2 receptor complex. treatment for chronic hepatitis C is improving rapidly due to the development of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target various aspects of the HCV life cycle. DAA regimens promise to increase SVR rates and eliminate the adverse effects associated with IFN- treatment. the IFNL4-G genotype could be associated with an impaired response to IFN-based treatment for other clinical conditions, similar to the associations that have been observed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B."}
