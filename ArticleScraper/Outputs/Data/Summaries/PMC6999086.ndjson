{"summary": "innate immune response is first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. innate immune response is characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates IFN-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFN-alpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase. the activated STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus. DP is caused by anatid herpesvirus type 1 (AHV-1) or duck plague virus (DP infection with virulent DPV strains causes gross lesions in ducks. upregulation of PRRs and ISGs expression has been reported. DPV exhibits broad organ tropism and activates the innate immune system. isolation and characterization of different types of duck primary cells could facilitate elucidation of the mechanism governing the organ tropism of DPV. the relationship between DPV infection and host antiviral innate immune responses were also investigated. the duck embryos were peeled away and carefully removed, and the cortex was transferred into a new dish filled with HBSS. the shears were transferred into 0.1% trypsin diluted in HBSS and digested for 20 min at RT. the cells were then resuspended with DMEM and dissociated by repeated pipetting (15 times) Isolation of Duck PBMCs were isolated from the 1-month-old anti-coagulation whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using a duck leukocyte Isolation kit. the blood was then diluted with sample dilution buffer and slowly added onto a layer of duck lymphocyte isolation buffer. the remaining cells were adjusted to 2 107 cells/ml and 1 ml of cells was plated in one well of the 12-well plate. duck PBMCs were isolated according to a reported method for isolating human macrophages. non-adherent cells were removed via vigorous washing three times using pre-warmed PBS. adherent cells were digested with trypsin for cell count. al antibody and goat anti-human -actin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Abclonal (Wuhan, China) mice anti-duck CD80 (Gene ID:101796029) and CD86 (Gene ID:101794331) antibodies were generated by our research center. blots were visualized using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) Primary duck neurons, astrocytes, or monocytes/macrophages were cultured for 4, 4, or 7 days, respectively, to form a confluent monolayer. the cells were then fixed with 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies against MAP2, GFAP, CD80, and DPV copy number in infected cells was calculated according to the standard curve. cGAS F XM_021271479.1 CCCTACCACCAATGTCACCC qRT-PCR cGAS R GGTTGCACTGGGGAGATTCA qRT-PCR STING F XM_021273408.1. qRT-PCR IL-6 F XM_013100522 TTCGACGAGGAGAAATGCTT qRT-PCR 18S F AF173614.1 TGTGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATT qRT-PCR 18S F AF173614.1 qRT-PCR 18S R TGGCAAATGCTTT qRT-PCR -actin F EF667345.1 GCCCTCTCTTT qRT-PCR -actin cDNA was synthesized by using NovoScript\u00ae Plus All-in-one 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (gDNA Purge) a total of 1 l of cDNA was transcribed into cDNA according to instructions of the superscript III Reverse Transcription kit. the cDNA concentration, primer sequence, and Q-PCR procedure applied for each gene in each cell type were the same. ages were pretreated with 5 M/ml of ruxolitinib for 1 h and then infected with CHv or CHa at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. the cells were then washed twice with PBS, and the same concentration of ruxolitinib was added to the culture medium. the cells were scraped in PBS from the plate to detect the viral genomic copy number. Graphs were plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0. all experiments were repeated at least three times individually. the brain was collected from 9-day-old duck embryos, the meninges were peeled away and carefully removed, and the cortex was transferred into a new dish filled with HBSS. the shears were transferred into 0.1% trypsin diluted in HBSS and digested for 20 min at RT. the cells were resuspended with DMEM and dissociated by repeated pipetting (15 times) duck PBMCs were isolated from the 1-month-old anti-coagulation whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using a duck leukocyte Isolation kit. the blood was then diluted with sample dilution buffer and slowly added onto a layer of duck lymphocyte isolation buffer. the remaining cells were adjusted to 2 107 cells/ml and 1 ml was plated in one well of the 12-well plate. Isolation of duck monocytes/macrophages was isolated according to a reported method for isolating human macrophages. non-adherent cells were enriched among PBMCs by adherence on plastic culture plates for 2 h. Rabbit anti-human MAP2 and -human GFAP polyclonal antibody and goat anti-human -actin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Abclonal (Wuhan, China) mice anti-duck CD80 (Gene ID:101796029) and -actin monoclonal antibody were generated by our research center. indirect immunofluorescence assay (qRT-PCR) Primary duck neurons, astrocytes, or monocytes/macrophages were cultured for 4, 4, or 7 days, respectively, to form a confluent monolayer. the cells were then fixed with 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies against MAP2, GFAP, CD80 infected cells were quantified using an absolute Q-PCR method as previously described (17) using primers specific to the sequence of DPV UL30.

Graphs were plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. we strove to isolate and culture duck neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes. MCs with human M-CSF can induce PBMCs to differentiate into macrophages. the survival time of the PBMCs was not more than 72 h without M-CSF. the PBMCs were isolated from the duck whole blood cells (WBCs) we successfully cultured duck primary neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages. we identified the cells using an IFA with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MAP2 for neurons, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFAP for astrocytes and a mouse polyclonal antibody against CD80 and CD86 for monocytes/macrophages. duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages respond to DNA and RNA virus analogs. the expression levels of IFN- (A), MX (B) and IL-6 (C) in duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages were determined using Q-PCR at 24 h post-treatment. monocytes/macrophages exhibit higher levels of IFN-, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine expression than DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and PBMCs. basal levels of cGAS were comparable among the different duck primary cells. basal levels of cGAS were highest in monocytes/macrophages. duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages were infected with a recombinant virulent virus strain, CHv-GFP, at a low MOI of 0.01. virus proliferation and morphology of the primary cells cultured in vitro were assessed by monitoring the expression of GFP. cells were infected with a virulent DPV strain (CHv) or an attenuated vaccine strain (CHa) at a MOI of 0.01. the viral titer in the cell culture supernatant was determined based on the TCID50 (Figures 5A\u2013C), and the intracellular viral genome copy number was also determined. supernatants were quantified by determining the TCID50 of each sample. the titers of both virus strains were comparable in monocytes/macrophages at 24 hpi. the genomic copy number of CHa was significantly higher than that of CHv at 24 hpi. cGAS, STING, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, MX, and IL-6 expression decreased by 12 and 24 hpi. in PBMCs, infection with the CHv strain induced a slight increase in expression levels at 6 hpi. the virus level of the CHv strain infected with PBMCs is slightly higher than that of the CHv strain. cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, and IL-6 decreased slightly at 12 and 24 hpi. expression of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, MX, and IL-6 decreased slightly at 12 and 24 hpi. expression of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, MX blockage of IFNAR signaling Enhanced CHa Strain Replication in astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. we first examined whether ruxolitinib functions in the duck cells by pretreating DEFs with ruxolitinib for 1 h and then infecting the cells with a duck RNA virus. ruxolitinib was used to treat duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages in further assays. ruxolitinib was used to treat duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages in further assays. at 24 hpi, the titer of CHa was significantly increased in the cell culture supernatants of astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. there was a certain increase observed in the culture supernatant of astrocytes infected with CHv. the viral titer and genomic copy number of the CHv strain was significantly decreased in monocytes/macrophages pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) there was no change in either viral titer or genomic copy number of the CHa strain. monocytes/macrophages were treated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at a dose of 10 or 20 g/ml for 2 h. after infection, the same concentration of poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) was added and the cells were incubated until the time point of examination. at 24 hpi, the viral titer and genomic copy number were determined. we strove to isolate and culture duck whole blood cells, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages according to previous methods used for mouse and human cells. the results showed that there are mainly erythrocyte and little partial of thrombocytes and leucocytes in the PBMCs. the leucocytes were above 95% in the PBMCs, and the monocytes were about 7% among the total PBMCs. the PBMCs were isolated from the duck whole blood cells. both cells were stained with Wright Strain. the time course of PBMCs differentiates into monocytes/macrophages. the basal expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, CD80, and CD86 in these five types of cells were detected by Q-PCR. these results indicated that our methods can successfully isolate duck neuronal, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages. macrophages were determined using Q-PCR at 24 h post-treatment. expression level of MX, an ISG induced by IFN or pathogens, was examined. poly(I:C) induced significantly higher expression of MX in all tested cells than did poly(dA:dT) or mock treatment. basal levels of cGAS were comparable among the different duck primary cells. basal levels of cGAS were highest in monocytes/macrophages. lowest in astrocytes and DEFs. all four types of virus-infected cells were radially enlarged at 48 h post-infection. no significant GFP expression was observed in DPV-infected PBMCs. DPV infects different types of duck cells in vitro. CHa produced higher viral genome copy number in DEFs at 24 hpi. but the viral titer was comparable at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. the attenuated strain of DPV replicates faster and produces more virus particles than the virulent strain in duck DEFs. the attenuated strain (CHa) abortively infects duck monocytes/macrophages. the virulent strain (CHv) persistently infects duck monocytes/macrophages. virulent strain (CHv) is an active immune response that is responsible for the decrease in viral titer of CHa strain. the expression levels of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, MX, and IL-6 were also examined in PBMCs. the expression levels of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-, and IL-6 were also examined in PBMCs. virulent DPV strain activates the innate immune system in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages during the early stages of infection. but then the innate immune response is downregulated once the virus begins to replicate. this strain abortively infects monocytes/macrophages and has been attenuated. DTMUV induced significant expression of IFN-, MX, and IL-6 in DEFs. expression levels of these factors were clearly reduced in cells treated with ruxolitinib. ruxolitinib was kept at the same concentration for 24 h. ruxolitinib was used to treat duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages in further assays. at 24 hpi, no change in CHv titer was detected in any of the five duck primary cells. monocytes/macrophages were pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at a dose of 20 g/ml for 12 h and then infected with the CHv or CHa strain at a MOI of 1.0. the viral titer and genomic copy number were significantly decreased in monocytes/macrophages pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) monocytes/macrophages were pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at a concentration of 20 g/ml for 12 h and then infected with either the CHv or CHa strain at a MOI of 1.0. at 24 h post-infection, the cell culture supernatants were collected for TCID50 determination (A,C), and the cells were washed with PBS, removed by scraping, and collected a significant reduction of viral titer and genomic copy number of the CHv strain was observed with monocytes/macrophages treated with poly(I:C) at a dose of either 10 or 20 g/ml resulted in a reduction in viral genome copy number (Figure 8H), but had no effect on viral titer. the expression of PRRs and ISGs in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages was consistently upregulated by infection with the attenuated vaccine strain (CHa) the virulent strain of DPV persistently infects monocytes/macrophages. the current lack of methods for culturing duck primary cells significantly hinders investigations of the role of each cell type in the infectious cycle, tropism, and pathogenicity of aquatic bird viruses. monocytes/macrophages formed at 3 days post-induction. the expected star shape was clearly observed for duck astrocytes isolated from brain tissue. no living cells were detected at 7 days post-seeding in absence of human or mouse M-CSF. deficiency of TLR3 causes astrocytes to become permissive to HSV-1 infection. deficiency of TLR3 causes astrocytes to become permissive to HSV-1 infection, thus facilitating infection of the entire CNS by HSV-1. early innate recognition of HSV-1 involves MDA-/MAVS-dependent pathways. expression of chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL3 in human macrophages induced by HSV-1 infection involves IFI16-dependent and IFI16-independent pathways. Activation of IFNAR signaling promotes high ISGs expression in macrophages infected with HSV-1. induced at 6 hpi and declined slightly at 12 and 24 hpi before rapidly increasing between 48 and 72 hpi. in the later time points of infection, the titer of the CHa strain was significantly lower than that of the CHv strain. DPV virulent strains have multiple, highly potent proteins that inhibit innate immunity. monocytes/macrophages transmits in the body using monocytes/macrophages as cell carriers. the authors separated lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages by washing the PBMCs at 2 and 24 h after plating. they then used the cells for assays.
