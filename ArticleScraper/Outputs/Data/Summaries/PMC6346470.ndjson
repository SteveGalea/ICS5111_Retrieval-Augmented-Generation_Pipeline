{"summary": "the concept of biological standardization and the use of biological reference materials has existed since the turn of the 20th century. it was applied by Dale in the 1920s to other biological products, such as insulin, but the need for international oversight was recognized (6). since 1947, the provision of WHO reference materials has played a vital role in translation of laboratory science into worldwide clinical practice. international reference panels Group of reference materials established to collectively aid evaluation of assays or diagnostic tests. reagents are interim and not intended to be replaced when they expire or are depleted. the second cluster, which focused on accelerating research and development processes, is subdivided into 3 distinct areas of work. central to the research and development blueprint is a list of priority diseases. for each priority disease on the list, a research and development roadmap is to be produced that encompasses diagnostics, therapeutics, and therapeutics. virus disease and Marburg virus disease Ebola virus antibody and NA IRPs available. VP40 antigen in development. no other filovirus IRPs available. development of IRPs usually takes 2\u20133 years, which is considerably longer than most outbreaks of diseases on the research and development blueprint. availability of IRPs for rare and sporadic diseases with epidemic potential before, or soon after, occurrence of outbreaks would facilitate diagnostics and research activities. development of Vaccines and Therapeutics No vaccine or therapeutic is currently licensed by regulators in Europe or the united states for use for any disease on the research and development blueprint. on august 8, 2014, WHO declared the Ebola outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. Availability of IRPs would enable characterization of potency, purity, and identity of complex biological materials, such as antibodies. challenges in development of standards for research and development blueprint diseases. ally and geographically, and outbreaks are often limited in numbers of cases and duration. these pathogens most commonly cause outbreaks in resource-constrained environments. poor healthcare infrastructure, limited diagnostic capability, and suboptimal disease reporting systems would limit retrospective identification of suitable patients. the process of acquiring new samples for development of reference materials should be registered as a unique study for each prioritized epidemic disease. this process would require ethics approval being sought through appropriate channels, thus enabling appropriate scrutiny by ethics and regulatory bodies in countries coordinating activities in disease-endemic countries where samples are to be collected. initiatives exist to facilitate sharing of benefits arising from the use of, and access to, human and nonhuman genetic material. concerns about inequitable sharing of benefits were further exacerbated during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic because of unequal access to vaccines. the threat of bioterrorism has resulted in strict rules and requirements. there is an encouraging increase in the number of Biosafety Level 4 laboratories globally. the safe acquisition, processing, exporting, and importing of samples from recovered emerging high-threat disease patients would require careful planning. available for future outbreaks."}
