{"summary": "pathogen species were categorized as emerging or reemerging. a species was regarded as emerging or reemerging if any recognized variant fell into this category. a species was regarded as emerging or reemerging based on previously published reviews. we compared the fraction of emerging or reemerging species that were or were not zoonotic across the major pathogen groups and within each group by family. we then compared the fraction of emerging and reemerging species that were or were not zoonotic. drivers for major pathogen groups and for zoonotic versus nonzoonotic pathogens. ranked by number of pathogen species associated with each. compared the ranking of drivers for the major pathogen groups and for zoonotic versus nonzoonotic pathogens. survey of human pathogens produced a count of 1,407 human pathogen species, with 177 (13%) species regarded as emerging or reemerging. 208 are viruses or prions, including 77 (37%) regarded as emerging or reemerging. mycobacteria account for the most species and for the most emerging and reemerging species. no significant difference was found between the 6 largest families. numbers of species of emerging and reemerging fungi, protozoa, and helminths were too small for meaningful comparisons. ungulates again the most important overall, supporting over 50 species. ungulates again the most important overall, supporting over 50 species. ranking of host types in terms of numbers correlates well. most zoonotic pathogens are either not transmissible (directly or indirectly) between humans at all (i.e., humans are a dead-end host) or are only minimally transmissible. rabies virus, rift Valley fever virus, and Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease) no significant difference was found between the 9 largest families (pooling the remainder) in the fraction of species regarded as emerging or reemerging. the enterobacteria and the mycobacteria account for the most species and for the most emerging and reemerging species. rs = 0.79, n = 7, p0.05) and individually for each pathogen group. the fraction tends to increase with host range: >40% of pathogens with the broadest host ranges. ungulates are the most important overall, supporting over 50 species. a total of 122 zoonotic species (10 of them emerging or reemerging) for which the host range is unknown are omitted. drivers of emergence and reemergence ranked these by the total number of pathogen species associated with them. a substantial minority of zoonotic pathogens are capable of some person-to-person transmission but do not persist without repeated reintroductions from a nonhuman reservoir. 1,407 pathogenic species of viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths are currently recognized. 177 (13%) pathogen species are considered emerging or reemerging. emerging and reemerging pathogens have been likened to weeds. this characteristic seems to be reflected in the broad range of drivers of the emergence or reemergence of pathogens. zoonotic pathogens are not highly transmissible within human populations. small changes in the nature of the host-pathogen interaction can lead to large increases (or decreases) in the scale of the public health problem. however, we currently have no way of predicting whether a novel human pathogen will behave like rabies or HIV (probably rarely introduced, but capable of causing a global pandemic) the most striking feature of emerging and reemerging pathogens is their diversity. surveillance and monitoring of infectious disease trends may have to be broadly targeted to be most effective. the most striking feature of emerging and reemerging pathogens is their diversity (Appendix) phalitis Wesselsbron West Nile Western equine encephalitis Yellow fever Zaire Ebola Zika Bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent Bacteria and rickettsia Aeromonas caviae A. veronii (var. sobria) ificus Yersinia enterocolitica Y. pestis Fungi Aspergillus fumigatus Blastomyces dermatitidis Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans C. krusei Coccidioides immitis Cryptococcus neoformans Fusarium moniliforme F. oxysporum F. solani Histoplasma capsulatum Malassezia pachyder"}
