{"summary": "21 patients fulfilled criteria for ADEM. of 48 patients presented with acute neurological symptoms and signs, 21 fulfilled criteria. commonest presentations were motor deficits, convulsions and altered consciousness. a number of recent reports of ADEM in children have confirmed the observations of McAlpine. the imaging studies are the cornerstone in confirming the diagnosis using computerized tomography (CT) and the more sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for disclosure of the extent and number of lesions. swabs, blood and CSF were carried out for pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, blood and CSF. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rotavirus (in stool if there was concurrent history of diarrhea) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibody tests for viruses and M. pneumoniae were considered significant. 57% of patients (12 of 21) had a history of upper respiratory tract illness mostly 4 weeks before presentation. one patient had a history of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. two patients had a history of acute gastroenteritis. brain MRI was performed in all patients with T1, T2, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), and gadolinium-enhanced T1 images. most lesions were less than 1 cm but in some cases were up to 2 cm in diameter. in only 1 of 21 patients, the MRI did not return to normal. the other 20 patients MRI scan findings improved both in number and in size of lesions. this patient had no other neurological deficits and these new lesions disappeared on follow-up MRI scan 18 months from the initial presentation. the duration of follow-up ranged between 12 months and 24 months. all patients had neurological deficits at discharge. only one patient had persistent seizures and needed anticonvulsant medication. initial T1, T2/FLAIR MRI findings in 21 patients with ADEM 18 patients (85.7%) had cortical and/or subcortical white matter lesions. most lesions were less than 1 cm but in some cases were up to 2 cm in diameter. patients stayed in the hospital for duration ranged from 7 days to 31 days. eighteen patients had maximum neurological deficits on admission. none beyond 1 week was ventilated. mumps, rubella, influenza, measles, varicella, HSV, EBV, Coxsackievirus Mycoplasma, Campylobacter, Streptococcus, Legionella, and Rickettsia have been implicated in ADEM. only six patients were identified to have infectious agents (two with HSV, one with EBV, one with influenza virus type H1N1 and two with Mycoplasma) a minority of children initially presenting with the clinical and neuroimaging features of ADEM may subsequently be considered having MS. two patients (9.5%) in the present study were suspected to have MS because of the recurrence. 3% of the children in the present report received high-dose steroids. 21%, 74% and 88% of children received high-dose steroids. neurologic outcome, relapse rates and MRI findings at follow-up were similar."}
