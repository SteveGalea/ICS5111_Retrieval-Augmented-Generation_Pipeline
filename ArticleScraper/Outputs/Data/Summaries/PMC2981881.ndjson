{"summary": "review Viruses are intracellular parasites that need the host's cellular machinery to reproduce. they exist in genetically heterogeneous populations because of their error-prone replication. the consequences of the extreme viral evolutionary dynamics are of tremendous importance for disease control and prevention. genetic diversity of RNA viruses makes it likely that adapted variants preexist in the population even before the selective pressure has changed. genetic diversity of RNA viruses makes it likely that adapted variants preexist in the population even before the selective pressure has changed. viral evolution occurs on different temporal and spatial scales. phylogenetic, population genetics, virus dynamics, and epidemiological methods are termed phylodynamics approaches. application of these techniques enabled reconstruction of molecular origin of the HIV pandemic. only few antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins are currently approved for use in humans [32]. Viruses that can be fought with chemical compounds include HIV, influenza virus, RSV, HCV, and the herpes viruses, including herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus. les morbilivirus live attenuated, MMR vaccine1 Polio poliovirus live attenuated, Sabin strain inactivated, Salk strain Rubella rubella virus live attenuated, MMR vaccine1 Cervical cancer human papillomavirus inactivated children severe diarrhea rotavirus live attenuated Rabies rabies virus inactivated virus Smallpox smallpox live attenuated vaccinia virus. the attenuated virus retains the ability to infect host cells. intracellular replication of the virus can stimulate cytotoxic CD8+ cells. a future challenge with the wild type virus will trigger the correct response. recombinant and peptide-based vaccines are produced by the expression of a genetic construct that codifies viral peptides [47,48], subunits of the virus [49], or whole viruses with genetic modifications including deletion of key proteins. many of these strategies have failed, mainly because of the low immunogenic capacity of peptides or subunits, compared with the whole live or inactivated particle. several subtypes of both genes have been isolated from mammalian and avian hosts. the two most recent pandemic strains H3N2 and H1N1 circulating in the human population. selective pressure exists for the virus to diversify and to generate immunological escape variants. viral evolution with periods of antigenic stasis and with episodic cluster transitions. cluster transition presents a population bottleneck and gives rise to a selective sweep which reduces the genetic diversity of the population. influenza vaccine needs to be redesigned regularly to account for genetic changes in the virus population. selection versus random genetic drift is a longstanding task rooted in Kimura\u2019s theory of neutral evolution. selection is typically identified by testing for departure from neutrality. the statistical tests are either based on the allelic distribution or on comparing variability in different classes of mutations. distance-based methods are computationally efficient, but the reduction of the observed data to a distance matrix presents a loss of information. both UPGMA and Neighbor Joining can reconstruct the correct tree only under strong assumptions about the distance matrix. the worldwide diversity of influenza sequences in any given year appears to be comparable to the diversity of HIV sequences found within a single infected individual. the genetic makeup of these sequences is much more difficult to predict from the currently circulating strains as compared to influenza. the same bioinformatics-assisted vaccine design approach that is established for influenza has not been equally successful for HIV to date. the envelope protein is located on the surface of HIV. it is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptor. the immunization induced the production of antibodies in vaccinated individuals, but they were unable to control infection or viremia. the STEP vaccine trials were designed to test the effectiveness of a T cell vaccine. several new vaccine design strategies are explored based on combining different epitopes. these methods include the construction of pseudo-protein strings of T cell epitopes. the synthetic scrambled antigen vaccine combines consensus overlapping peptide sets from HIV-1 proteins. phylogenetic trees are limited in the presence of reticulate evolutionary events, such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, or recombination. in most RNA viruses, homologous recombination can occur when a cell is coinfected with two different strains. recombination rate is on the order of 2 to 3 times per genome per replication cycle. viral sequences obtained from different hosts cannot be regarded as independent observations of the same stochastic process. phylogenetic dependency networks (PDNs) are a class of probabilistic graphical models that account for these confounding factors. the partial order restricts the viral genotype space to the subset of those mutational patterns compatible with the partial order constraints. the rationale for this approach is that many combinations of mutations are never observed, for example, because they result in inviable viruses. the genetic barrier improves therapy outcome predictions. the resulting models outperform standard-of-care expert rule-based treatment recommendations. a successful HIV vaccine should not only minimize the distance to currently circulating strains, but also anticipate possible immune escape pathways of the virus. infected cells cannot be recognized by the immune system until the integrated provirus is activated. a vaccine that elicits an incomplete response may be sufficient to keep viral load in controllable levels. the vaccine would delay or prevent the progression to AIDS, the final stage of the disease. each specific viral family may give rise to modifications of this model due to variations in its life cycle. the model is an epidemiological SIR model [151], in which infection is treated as a microepidemic and host cells play the role of infected or susceptible individuals. a correlation between viral load at initial stages of the infection and viral set point was observed. a successful vaccine is one that boosts the immune response, i.e., increases the parameter a', such that R0 is reduced below the critical value of 1. however, even if the vaccine induces an immune response that is not strong enough to reduce R0 to a value below 1, it may still be beneficial. the critical proportion of immune individuals above which the disease cannot persist is the HI threshold. the higher the reproductive ratio of the disease, the more individuals need to be effectively protected by vaccination. the HI threshold varies not only with the virulence of the disease, but also with the efficacy of the vaccine and the contact dynamics of the host population. the viral genome synthesized encodes the same amino acid sequence as the wild type virus but encoded by infrequent codons in their host cells. this feature has also been employed to the rational design of a Poliovirus LAV [165]. coinfection is reminiscent of the concept of competition-colonization trade-off in ecology. virulent viral variants play the role of colonizers and viruses efficient within coinfected cells are competitors. virulent viral variants play the role of colonizers and viruses efficient within coinfected cells are competitors. viral evolution occurs on different temporal and spatial scales. phylogenetic, population genetics, virus dynamics, and epidemiological methods are termed phylodynamics approaches. study of correlated evolution among genotypic and phenotypic traits is known as the comparative method. hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) only few antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins are currently approved for use in humans. currently the vast majority of viruses cannot be controlled with any approved compound. vaccines are considered the best weapon to fight viruses. flu influenza inactivated Mumps mumps virus live attenuated, MMR vaccine1, Sabin strain inactivated, Salk strain Rubella rubella virus live attenuated, MMR vaccine1 Cervical cancer human papillomavirus inactivated Japanese encephalitis. 2 Small pox vaccine is no longer routinely administered because of eradication of smallpox. the attenuated virus accumulates mutations in the genome that optimize replication in the new host or new cell type. the virus retains the ability to infect host cells. a future challenge with the wild type virus will trigger the correct response, i.e., predominantly cellular response or predominantly humoral response. recombinant and peptide-based vaccines are produced by the expression of a genetic construct that codifies viral peptides [47,48], subunits of the virus [49], or whole viruses with genetic modifications including deletions of key proteins. many of these strategies have failed, mainly because of the low immunogenic capacity of peptides or subunits, compared with the whole live or inactivated particle. the viral genome is categorized by the serology and genetics of its two surface glycoproteins neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) several subtypes of both genes have been isolated from mammalian and avian hosts, including the two most recent pandemic strains H3N2 and H1N1 circulating in the human population. selective pressure exists for the virus to diversify and to generate immunological escape variants. the model explains the observed pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis and with episodic cluster transitions. the cluster transition presents a population bottleneck and gives rise to a selective sweep which reduces the genetic diversity of the population. the vaccine needs to be redesigned regularly to account for genetic changes in the virus population. analysis confirms that the viral lineages with the greatest number of mutations in the positively selected codons were the ancestors of future H3 lineages in 9 out of 11 influenza seasons [22]. phylogenetic methods play an important role in the analysis of viral sequence data. phylogenetic methods play an important role in the analysis of viral sequence data. unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [81], an average linkage clustering method, and Neighbor Joining [82] are prominent examples of this approach. distance-based methods are computationally efficient, but the reduction of the observed data to a distance matrix presents a loss of information. the worldwide diversity of influenza sequences in any given year appears to be comparable to the diversity of HIV sequences found within a single infected individual at one time point. the genetic makeup of these sequences is much more difficult to predict from the currently circulating strains as compared to influenza. the same bioinformatics-assisted vaccine design approach that is established for influenza has not been equally successful for HIV to date. the VAXGEN vaccine was intended to immunize subjects with a recombinant envelope protein of HIV (rgp120) the envelope protein is located on the surface of HIV and is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptor [95] antibodies targeted against this protein could block HIV infection and subsequently block virus entry into cells. several new vaccine design strategies are explored based on combining different epitopes. these methods include the construction of pseudo-protein strings of T cell epitopes. the synthetic scrambled antigen vaccine combines consensus overlapping peptide sets from HIV-1 proteins. phylogenetic trees are limited in the presence of reticulate evolutionary events, such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, or recombination. in most RNA viruses, homologous recombination can occur when a cell is coinfected with two different

vaccine should not only minimize the distance to currently circulating strains, but also anticipate possible immune escape pathways of the virus. retrovirus family has the ability to integrate its genome into the host cell genome. a vaccine that elicits an incomplete response may be sufficient to keep viral load in controllable levels. a vaccine that elicits an incomplete response may be sufficient to keep viral load in controllable levels. in the absence of viral infection, cells reproduce at rate and die at rate d. each specific viral family may give rise to modifications of this model due to variations in its life cycle. the model is an epidemiological SIR model [151], in which infection is treated as a microepidemic and host cells play the role of infected or susceptible individuals. a successful vaccine is one that boosts the immune response, i.e., increases the parameter a', such that R0 is reduced below the critical value of 1. however, even if the vaccine induces an immune response that is not strong enough to reduce R0 to a value below 1, it may still be beneficial. HI occurs if partial vaccination provides protection to unvaccinated individuals. the critical proportion of immune individuals above which the disease cannot persist is the HI threshold. the higher the reproductive ratio of the disease, the more individuals need to be effectively protected by vaccination. a new strategy for attenuation of viruses is the rational design and synthesis of viral genomes with a strong codon bias. the viral genome synthesized encodes the same amino acid sequence as the wild type virus but encoded by infrequent codons in their host cells. virulence can increase in the population under a variety of conditions. virulent viral variants play the role of colonizers and viruses efficient within coinfected cells are competitors. the attenuating effect of competition-colonization trade-off appears even more pronounced if many viruses from a broad spectrum of virulence are considered. authors declare no competing interests. full contents of supplement are available online at http://www.immunome-research.com/supplements/6/S2."}
