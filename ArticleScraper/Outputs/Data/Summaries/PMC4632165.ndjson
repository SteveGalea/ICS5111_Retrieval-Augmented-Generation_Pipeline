{"summary": "macrophages play a role in nearly every human disease and are appealing targets for drug delivery, novel therapies, and pharmacologic depletion techniques. nonhuman primates, such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, play a pivotal role in biomedical research by providing physiologically relevant models for the study and development of preclinical therapeutics. we first tested an anti-CD14-depleting antibody but failed to induce in vivo depletion of monocytes. the results indicate that LA is a viable method for the depletion of monocyte/macrophage Lin cells in nonhuman primates. the results indicate that LA is a viable method for the depletion of monocyte/macrophage Lin cells in nonhuman primates. antibody was suspended in PBS at 15.5 mg/ml and injected s.c. in a single 50-mg/kg dose. animals were prophylactically treated with Benadryl (5 mg/kg i.m.) before administering antibody. cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS (R10; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) strainer was rinsed repeatedly with R10 to obtain a single-cell suspension. strainer was rinsed repeatedly with R10 to obtain a single-cell suspension. cell fractions collected from the EDTA and collagenase digestion steps were combined (total tissue) and resuspended in 30% isotonic Percoll. cells were then layered over a 60%/40% Percoll gradient and spun at 500 g with the brake off. Flow cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo, version 9.6.4 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA) all positive gates were set by using fluorescence minus one control tubes for the appropriate fluorophore. LC or LA was diluted in room temperature, 1 PBS, to a final volume of 20 ml. the appropriate mass of LC or LA (determined by animal body weight) was administered at 4 ml/min by i.v. (saphenous vein) animals were prophylactically treated with Benadryl (5 mg/kg i.m.) before administering antibody. blood and tissue processing Whole blood was collected into EDTA-treated tubes. a 500-l aliquot was used to assess complete blood counts. cell-containing supernatant was added again, tissues shaken, and cells collected. Tissues were washed twice in 1 HBSS to remove excess EDTA. cell fractions collected from the EDTA and collagenase digestion steps were combined. fixed cells were washed twice in a 1:1 mixture of saponin buffer and 2 BD FACSPerm and then washed once in saponin buffer and stained for 1 h at room temperature. samples were then run on an LSR II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) toxicity of LA Cell-free serum was assessed by determination of albumin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin concentrations. anti-CD14 antibody does not deplete RMs Immune cell depletion in nonhuman primates is traditionally achieved by administration of mAb with high affinity for surface receptors. anti-CD14 antibody staining was abrogated completely by 2 d.p.i., but an analogous marker, CD163, showed increased monocyte frequency. however, it remained unclear whether this was true depletion of the cells or masking of the CD14 antigen. LC, a first-generation bisphosphonate reagent, has been used to deplete monocytes and macrophages in many animal models. we injected two cynomolgus macaques with 0.1 mg/kg LC i.v. and monitored the absolute and relative frequencies of CD14+ monocytes over 7 days. LC is unsuitable for monocyte depletion in nonhuman primates. repeated low-dose LA administration revealed no change in liver function. a single high-dose led to perturbation of liver function. LC failed to deplete monocytes in cynomolgus macaques. cynomolgus macaques exhibited a sharp decline in CD14+ monocyte frequencies by 1 d.p.i. this depletion was transient, however, as CD14+ monocyte frequencies returned to baseline levels by 2 d.p.i.. thus, LA is an effective alternative to LC for monocyte depletion in nonhuman primates. cynomolgus macaques receiving 0.1 mg/kg LA i.v. showed a 50% reduction in monocyte frequency by 1 d.p.i. despite these findings, we observed no adverse clinical side-effects of LA treatment in these animals nor in any animals receiving LA, regardless of dose or frequency. the dose and route of LA treatment can increase monocyte depletion in nonhuman primates. monocyte frequencies in the control animals remained stable at 1 d.p.i., whereas the control RMs maintained at 1 d.p.i. we monitored monocyte subset frequencies through 7 d.p.i. to determine the duration of our depletion. the absolute counts of monocytes/ml of blood also showed substantial declines at 1 d.p.i.. this was most pronounced in Rh28034 and Rh28099. the pharmacodynamics of LA far exceeds its pharmacokinetics in RM. a \u201cwash-out\u201d period of 4\u20136 weeks may be necessary between doses. we hypothesized that this blood monocyte depletion would be paralleled by a decrease in the frequency of tissue-resident macrophages and bone marrow monocytes. we found no change in the frequency of alveolar macrophages in the BAL following LA treatment from bone marrow aspirate, liver, and colon. MAC387 is an antibody that recognizes the calcium-binding protein MRP14, which is expressed in tissue-resident macrophages [25\u201327]. we looked at the frequency of cells expressing these markers in the bone marrow before and after LA treatment. as blood monocytes express MAC387 and CD163 following emigration from the bone marrow, we performed a separate analysis defining bone marrow monocytes as CD163+. this analysis revealed significant increases in bone marrow monocyte frequency following the administration of LA (P=0.031; Fig. 4C) the majority of depleted macrophages in the liver was MAC387+CD163 (Fig. 4B, and data not shown) this same trend was observed in the colon, where overall macrophage frequency was reduced by >45% in four of five animals. in the colon, however, the depletion was distributed more evenly across the three macrophage populations (Fig. 4B, and data not shown) intracellular antibody staining revealed high levels of monocyte turnover following LA treatment in both the CD14+CD16 (classical) and CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocyte populations. BrdU staining revealed high levels of monocyte turnover. compared with control animal at 1 d.p.i., we found 10% of CD14+CD16+ monocytes staining positive for BrdU. acute inflammation leads to increased monocyte turnover, as monocytes enter the affected tissues to differentiate into macrophages. la-mediated monocyte depletion was highly transient in all nonhuman primates examined. this finding is in full support of previous work with rabbits, rats, and humans. p.i. were similar or greater to those seen in RMs with severe encephalitis. pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of LA in the lung have been studied in vivo previously in rabbits and rats. the half-life of LA in rabbits following a 10-mg/kg LA injection is 35.4 h. however, LA half-life is dependent on dose response. a recent study in RMs characterized the markers expressed by different populations of lung-resident macrophages. MAC387+CD163+ interstitial macrophages respond to classical macrophage activation signals (IFN- and LPS) both blood monocytes and interstitial macrophages coexpress high levels of MAC387 and CD163. nonhuman primates provide a powerful model of human biology. we advance the nonhuman primate model by showing that monocytes and macrophages can be experimentally depleted by administration of LA. granulocytes were excluded based on their side-scatter and CD45dim profile. Lin-positive cells were excluded based on their expression of CD3, CD8 and CD20. CD14 staining was abrogated completely by 2 d.p.i., but an analogous marker, CD163, showed increased monocyte frequency. LC, a first-generation bisphosphonate reagent, has been used to deplete monocytes and macrophages in many animal models. we injected two cynomolgus macaques with 0.1 mg/kg LC i.v. and monitored the absolute and relative frequencies of CD14+ monocytes over 7 days. LC is unsuitable for monocyte depletion in nonhuman primates. repeated low-dose LA administration revealed no change in liver function. a single high-dose led to perturbation of liver function. LC failed to deplete monocytes in cynomolgus macaques. cynomolgus macaques monitored the absolute and relative frequencies of CD14+ monocytes over 7 days. LC-treated animals showed a sharp decline in CD14+ monocyte frequencies by 1 d.p.i. (50% reduction) this depletion was transient, however, as CD14+ monocyte frequencies returned to baseline levels by 2 d.p.i. cynomolgus macaques receiving 0.1 mg/kg LA i.v showed a 50% reduction in monocyte frequency by 1 d.p.i. cynomolgus macaques receiving 0.1 mg/kg LA i.v. showed a 50% reduction in monocyte frequency by 1 d.p.i. cynomolgus macaques receiving 0.1 mg/kg LA i.v. showed a 50% reduction in monocyte frequency following LA treatment, we observed large decreases in monocyte frequency at 1 d.p.i., with a particularly pronounced depletion in Rh28034. Alternate routes of LA administration can increase monocyte depletion in RM. pletion of nearly all CD14CD16+ monocytes at 1 d.p.i., whereas control RMs maintained similar monocyte subset frequencies at 1 d.p.i., supporting the lack of overall monocyte depletion that we observed. absolute counts of monocytes/ml of blood also showed substantial declines at 1 d.p.i. the pharmacodynamics of LA far exceeds its pharmacokinetics in RM. a \u201cwash-out\u201d period of 4\u20136 weeks may be necessary between doses. we hypothesized that this blood monocyte depletion would be parallel by a decrease in the frequency of tissue-resident macrophages. the bone marrow before and after LA treatment showed a significant increase in monocyte precursor production. four of five RMs showed decreases in colon macrophages. we found no change in the frequency of alveolar macrophages in the BAL following LA treatment. s expressed CD68, with the latter population showing the highest expression. we extended this analysis to determine the effectiveness of LA treatment on monocyte depletion in the bone marrow. as blood monocytes express MAC387 and CD163 following emigration from the bone marrow, we looked at the frequency of cells expressing these markers in the bone marrow. the majority of depleted macrophages in the liver was MAC387+CD163. this same trend was observed in the colon, where overall macrophage frequency was reduced by >45% in four of five animals. in the colon, however, the depletion was distributed more evenly across the three macrophage populations (Fig. 4B, and data not shown) BrdU is a synthetic thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during S-phase. monocyte precursors in the bone marrow integrate BrdU before being released into the blood as monocytes. this makes BrdU a reliable marker of myeloid cell turnover. both the CD14+CD16 (classical) and CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) populations stain positive for BrdU. compared with control animal Rh31577, which had no CD14+CD16+BrdU+ monocytes at 1 d.p.i.. the levels of monocyte turnover that we observed in LA-treated animals at 1 d.p.i. were similar or greater to those seen in SIV-infected RMs, including rapid progressors with severe encephalitis [30, 35]. thus, LA treatment increases blood monocyte turnover, a finding in support of our increased bone marrow monocyte generation and blood monocyte depletion data. the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of LA have been studied in vivo. the half-life of LA in rabbits following a 10-mg/kg LA injection is 35.4 h. however, LA half-life is dependent on dose response. MAC387+CD163+ macrophages have been characterized as M1-like and CD163+ macrophages as M2-like, with little to no coexpression of these markers on the same cells. MAC387+CD163+ interstitial macrophages respond to classical macrophage activation signals (IFN- and LPS) nonhuman primates provide a powerful model of human biology. we advance the nonhuman primate model by showing that monocytes and macrophages can be experimentally depleted by LA."}
