{"summary": "no therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. a critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. the genus Ebolavirus is composed of five viruses: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus. this genus is one of two extant genera that compose the family Filoviridae. five different PS receptors and five CLRs have been shown to facilitate filovirion uptake. these receptors mediates uptake of virions into endosomes where the filovirion GP is proteolytic processed. a wide range of host cells are susceptible to infection, including macrophages. M1 or classically activated macrophages are elicited by exposure to proinflammatory signals such as interferon gamma (IFN-) macrophages are immunomodulatory macrophages and elicited by signals such as cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and TGF-. these cells perform disparate functions in the body. studies have shown that IFN- treatment inhibits EBOV infection. in vivo IFN- administered as late as 24 hours following EBOV challenge abrogates morbidity and mortality. eliciting a proinflammatory state at early times during filovirus infection can control filovirus replication. IL-4/IL-13 polarization of murine peritoneal macrophages enhances EBOV GP-dependent infection by increasing cell surface expression of CLRs. recombinant virus has been used by numerous groups to study filovirus entry. recombinant virus has been used by numerous groups to study filovirus entry. rVSV/EBOV GP entry increased virus-associated mortality. polarization of macrophages generates a macrophage that is highly susceptible for EBOV entry and infection through enhancement of cell surface CLRs. imd-4 genotyping primers were used in PCR amplification for 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 m. all infections were performed using a virus that provides predictable killing in mice. mice were monitored daily for signs of morbidity. cells were washed with RPMI containing 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA),1% sodium pyruvate, and murine MCSF at 20ng/mL. cells were polarized with human cytokines on day 6 of differentiation. cells were polarized with human cytokines on day 6 of differentiation.

RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR analysis of viral genomes. IL-4/IL-13 treatment was upregulated 13-fold by IL-4/IL-13 treatment. two PS receptors, Tyro3 and TIM-4, and the critical endosomal receptor NPC1 were modestly enhanced. expression of other known filovirus surface receptors was unchanged. the number of cells within the pmac population expressing cell surface CLRs, SIGNR3, SIGNR5 and MGL were enhanced by the cytokine treatment. however, neither SIGNR1 nor the PS receptor, TIM-4, were increased. parallel surface staining studies were unable to detect expression of Tyro3. transfection of human DC-SIGN resulted in a 35-fold enhancement of rVSV/EBOV GP infection. none of these receptors when expressed in HEK 293T cells impacted rVSV/G infection to the degree seen in rVSV/EBOV GP. reduced virus infection of IL-4/IL-13 polarized murine pmacs and human MDMs. results strongly suggest that DC-SIGN/SIGNR3 mediates increased rVSV/EBOV GP susceptibility in hMDMs. pmacs express SIGNR3 upon IL-4/IL-13 treatment, but constitutively express the PS receptor TIM-4 [47] that has been shown to serve as a filovirus receptor in HEK 293T cells [51, 70]. pmacs from TIM-4-sufficient mice supported higher levels of viral infection than those from Timd-4-/- mice. TIM-4 is a critical EBOV receptor on peritoneal macrophages. pmacs were infected with the indicated infectious units of rVSV/EBOV GP. pmacs were infected with the indicated infectious units of rVSV/EBOV GP. pmacs were harvested from C57BL/6 Ifnar-/- or Ifnar/Timd-4 -/- mice. incubated with VLPs expressing EBOV GP and EBOV VP40 fused to beta lactamase. pmacs were more sensitive to the effects of IL-4/IL-13 treatment. IL-4/IL-13 treated or untreated cells were infected with rVSV/EBOV GP (MOI = 0.1) infection was quantified by detection of GFP expression at 24 hours post infection. RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR. peritoneal cells were isolated and changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR were assessed. expression of the M1 marker gene IRF-1 was modestly increased in mice administered IFN- and the M2a marker genes Fizz-1 and SIGNR3 were increased. pmacs were harvested from mice 2 days post infection and viral load was assessed by qRT-PCR. IL-4/IL-13 administration increases virus load in an EBOV GP-dependent manner. a dose of rVSV/EBOV GP that resulted in no mortality in the mice caused 100% mortality in IL-4/IL-13-treated mice. female Ifnar-/- mice were injected i.p. with 10ug IL-4/IL-13 or PBS 24 hours prior to i.p. infection with either 7x101 iu rVSV/EBOV GP (n = 10) or 1x102 iu rVSV/G (n = 5) survival was monitored (A,B) or pmacs were isolated at day 2 post infection and assessed for viral load by qRT-PCR (C) rVSV/EBOV GP is an excellent model for studying EBOV entry events [13, 41, 43, 44, 50\u201353] polarization of macrophages increases susceptibility to rVSV/EBOV GP. key in vitro experiments were also performed using murine cells and human monocyte derived macrophages. cytokines induce an M2a phenotype [58, 59]. we investigated the effect of these cytokines on the ability of both murine pmacs and human MDMs to support infection of rVSV/EBOV GP. IL-4/IL-13-stimulated macrophages were more robustly infected by rVSV/EBOV GP compared to non-polarized controls. es were treated with 20ng/ml of IL-4 and IL-13 for 24 hours prior to infection with rVSV/EBOV GP (MOI = 5) or WT VSV (MOI = 1). Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from female C57BL/6 mice, treated with 20ng/ml IL-4/IL-13 for 24 hours or left unstimulated. data are expressed as mean S.D. EBOV virus like particles (VLPs) containing EBOV VP40 fused to -lactamase were assessed for fusion efficiency. pmacs exposed to IL-4/IL-13 were more susceptible to VLP fusion. enhanced entry, likely secondary to enhanced binding, is at least in part responsible for increased infection observed in M2a macrophages. peritoneal macrophages from Ifnar-/- mice were incubated with VLPs expressing either EBOV GP or VSV G and EBOV VP40 fused to beta lactamase. entry was quantified by loading cells with -lactam-containing fluorescent substrate. each experiment was performed a minimum of two times. we found that IL-4/IL-13 enhanced virus infection of pmacs by about 3 to 3.5-fold. regardless of whether PS liposomes were present suggesting these receptors do not mediate the IL-4/IL-13-enhanced infection. we also investigated IL-4/IL-13 upregulation of DC-SIGN on human MDMs. pmacs were unstimulated or stimulated with 20ng/ml of IL-4/IL-13. expression was quantified by qRT-PCR and expressed relative to HPRT levels. none of these receptors when expressed in HEK 293T cells impacted rVSV/G infection to the degree seen in rVSV/EBOV GP. none of these receptors when expressed in HEK 293T cells impacted rVSV/G infection to the degree seen in rVSV/EBOV GP. HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. cells were treated with the indicated sugar for one hour and infected with rVSV/EBOV GP (MOI = 1). GFP+ cells were quantified 24 hours post infection. pmacs express SIGNR3 upon IL-4/-13 treatment, but constitutively express the PS receptor TIM-4. pmacs from TIM-4-sufficient mice supported higher levels of viral infection. pmacs from TIM-4-sufficient mice supported higher levels of infection. bone marrow derived macrophages and pmacs from C57BL/6 Ifnar-/- or Ifnar/Timd-4 -/- mice were lifted from tissue culture plates. positively gated cells were analyzed for TIM-4 (grey histogram) or isotype control (white histogram) pmacs from Timd-4-/- mice were more sensitive to the effects of IL-4/IL-13 treatment. rVSV/EBOV GP binding and VLP membrane fusion were strongly enhanced in TIM-4-null pmacs. IL-4/IL-13 treated or untreated cells were preincubated with 200ug/mL of mannan or GalNac for 1 hour. cells were infected with rVSV/EBOV GP (MOI = 0.1) and GFP+ cells were quantified 24 hours post infection. expression of the M1 marker gene IRF-1 was modestly increased in mice administered IFN-. the M2a marker genes Fizz-1 and, in particular, SIGNR3 were increased in IL-4/IL-13 treated mice. pmacs were harvested from mice 2 days post infection. a dose of rVSV/EBOV GP that resulted in no mortality in IL-4/IL-13-treated mice caused 100% mortality in IL-4/IL-13-treated mice. in vivo administration of a large bolus of cytokine is likely to have additional effects on the immune response, we performed ex vivo polarization and adoptive transfer of IL-4/IL-13 treated macrophages. Male Ifnar/Timd-4-/- mice were injected i.p. with 10ug IL-4/IL-13 or PBS 24 hours prior to i.p. infection with 1x104 i.u. rVSV/EBOV GP. survival was monitored (n = 8/group). addition of IL-4/IL-13-treated pmacs to Ifnar/Timd-4-/- mice resulted in greater viral pathogenesis. rVSV/EBOV GP has been found to be an excellent model for understanding EBOV entry, recapitulating all steps of binding and internalization. mannose-binding CLRs, DC-SIGN in humans and SIGNR3 in mice, were increased on the surface of pmacs by a 24 h treatment with IL-4/IL-13. expression of MGL, another CLR that can support EBOV binding and internalization, was also significantly upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 treatment. both SIGNR1 (CD209b) and SIGNR3 (CD209a) are able to mediate virus entry. but only SIGNR3 is upregulated when exposed to IL-4/IL-13. polarized macrophages do not exhibit IL-4/IL-13-dependent enhancement. a 191 amino acid extracellular neck domain of DC-SIGN is thought to be important for oligomerization of the receptor. a similar long repeat domain is absent in the murine proteins. however, apparently the neck domain of SIGNR3 is sufficient for homo-oligomerization. it is of interest to understand physiological or pathological conditions that may push macrophage populations to an \u201cM2\u201d state. disease states that elicit an M2-like phenotype are parasitic infections caused by roundworm and whipworms and tumors. elicit a strong type 2 immune response and may play an important role as a pre-existing condition during filovirus outbreaks. ectopic expression of TIM-4 in HEK 293T cells enhances rVSV/EBOV GP entry in murine pmacs. two lines of evidence indicated that TIM-4 is important for EBOV infection of pmacs. media with 20 ng/ml IL-4 and IL-13 for 24 hours. qRT-PCR was performed to analyze expression of genes known to be characteristic of polarized macrophages. data are shown as mean S.D. and represent at least three independent replicates. rVSV/G does not utilize SIGNR receptors for cellular entry. hek 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. cells were analyzed 24 hours following infection for GFP expression by flow cytometry."}
