{"summary": "VSV induces cell death primarily through activation of the apoptotic pathway. innate sensing of viral RNA by the RIG-I like receptors leads to induction of the innate immune response and production of interferons. newly synthesized IFN proteins act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to upregulate the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. a small-plaque variant VSV contains a 51 deletion in the viral matrix (M) protein. the attenuated mutant is a potent inducer of the IFN response in healthy cells that does not block nuclear export of host cell antiviral mRNAs. we previously characterized a synergistic strategy in prostate cancer. increased oncolytic activity was correlated with a time-dependent decrease in the expression of IRF3, IRF7, IFN-, and MX1. removal of HDIs led to a decrease in viral replication within malignant cells. treatment of tumor cells with HDIs frequently induces apoptosis through caspase activation. purpose of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the vorinostat-mediated development of VSV permissiveness in prostate cancer cells. vorinostat blocks IFN responses, but also stimulates expression of a subset of NF-B target genes. cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer. the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 g for 20 min. immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1% CHAPS lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in loading buffer, and bound protein was analysed by immunoblotting. antibody alone, lysate alone, or an irrelevant isotype-matched immunoglobulin G antibody were used as negative controls. the chromatin fraction was washed once with buffer B and centrifuged at 10,000 g. the pellet was then resuspended in 1% NP-40 protein extraction buffer. the final supernatant contained the soluble nuclear proteins. gel-bound proteins were digested with trypsin (20 ng/l; Promega, Madison, WI) in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 37\u00b0C with constant mixing for 12 h. eluent containing tryptic peptides was dried and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to mass spectrometric analysis. LC-ESI\u2013MS-MS analysis was conducted using a C18 column (75 m by 150 mm) mobile phases were 0.1% HCOOH in water (A) and 0.1% HCOOH in acetonitrile (B) a four-step linear gradient was used for the LC separation (2% to 30% B in the first 47 min, followed by 80% B in the next 1 min and holding at 80% B for 12 min) PC3 cells were seeded onto 22-mm-diameter coverslips in 6-well plates at 1 105 cells/well. the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol. the coverslips were blocked with 3% BSA-PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed using 48.48 BioMark Dynamic Arrays (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA), enabling quantitative measurement of up to 48 different mRNAs in 48 samples under identical reaction conditions. the data were collected using the AB 7500 Real-Time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) microarray analysis was conducted using 750 ng of biotinylated cRNA hybridized to human reference 8 version 3 BeadChips. a significance analysis of microarray (SAM) test was then performed on each experimental condition versus the control. the LIMMA package was used to fit a linear model to each probe. to control the expected proportions of false positives, the false discovery rate for each unadjusted P value was calculated using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. PC3 cells were transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting luciferase control (Ctrl-Luc) or RELA/p65 (shRel) (37) were a kind gift from Thorsten Schinke, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Germany. vorinostat, MS-275, and BAY11-7082 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) 20 micrograms of anti-RELA/p65 cross-linked to 300 l of protein AG-Plus agarose beads using 0.2 mol/liter triethanolamine, pH 8.0. cells were lysed with 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in loading buffer, and bound protein was analysed by immunoblotting. triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. cells were incubated on ice for 5 min. supernatant was separated from the pellet, which contained the nuclei. pellet fraction was then centrifuged at 1,700 g. the cell suspension was vortexed, and after a quick spin at 13,300 g, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was separated from the pellet (nuclear fraction) the nuclear fraction was further solubilized by resuspending the pellet in ice-cold buffer C (20 mM Tris, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.9) liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry LC-ESI\u2013MS-MS was conducted using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. the data-dependent acquisition settings were a top 12 higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) for the Q-Exactive MS. sin was set as the protease, with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. raw files were searched against the RELA protein using Byonic (39) with a peptide tolerance of 15 ppm, an MS-MS tolerance of 20 ppm for HCD data, the carbamidomethylated cysteine as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine and acetylation as variable modifications. RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (GE Healthcare, Piscataway Township, NJ), and amplification was carried out for 25 to 30 cycles. cDNA was amplified using SyBR Green I PCR master mix. cells were exposed to VSV with and without vorinostat for 48 h. the cells were then washed with PBS containing 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and resuspended in Perm II buffer. after washing, the cells were stained with 1 g/100 l of primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. the response variable describes and groups the data based on experimental conditions. repeated permutations of the data are used to determine if the expression of any gene is significantly related to the response. RESULTS Gene expression profiles in PC3 cells treated with VSV and vorinostat. the effects of vorinostat or MS-275 on both gene transcription and viral replication were reversible. the effects of vorinostat or MS-275 on both gene transcription and viral replication were reversible. vorinostat treatment potentiates VSV replication, induces expression of NF-B-regulated genes, and suppresses interferon response. PC3 cells were pretreated with MS-275 (2 M) or vorinostat (5 M) for 24 h. after infection, the culture medium was supplemented with either complete medium containing MS-275 (C) or complete medium alone (H [halted treatment]. blot analysis of RELA/p65 revealed a modest but significant 1.3- to 2.2-fold increase in total acetylated lysine residues with continuous vorinostat or MS-275 treatment (P 0.01) the effect of vorinostat on increased protein acetylation was confirmed by 2-fold increases in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for total acetylated histones. acetylation of 8 of 18 lysine residues in RELA/p65 leads to increased DNA binding of nuclear RELA/p65. PC3 cells were exposed to the indicated experimental conditions for 24 h. the chromatin-bound fraction was immunoblotted for RELA/p65. NF-B inhibition decreases VSV replication and oncolysis. a specific inhibitor of IB kinase (IKK) was used to block NF-B activity. a 3- to 6-fold increase in nuclear retention of RELA/p65 was observed in cells treated with vorinostat or vorinostat plus VSV. cotreatment with BAY11 led to 50% decrease in expression of these genes. the IKK inhibitor blocks vorinostat-mediated nuclear translocation of p65. PC3 cells treated with vorinostat for 24 h were also pretreated with 10 M BAY11 for 1 h. ostat-plus DMSO treatment; dark-blue bars, vorinostat-plus-VSV-plus BAY11 treatment. an 50 to 70% decrease in the number of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4A) and 1- to 2-log-unit decrease in virion release were observed in PC3 cells. qPCR in Luc-Ctrl (white bars) and shRel (black bars) cells exposed to VSV with or without vorinostat at 12 and 24 h postinfection. we also examined the effects of decreased expression of RELA/p65 in PC3 cells on VSV replication using a genetic approach. increased expression of genes belong to the autophagy pathway in PC3 cells. levels of mRNA for ATG101, ATG7, and GABARAPL1 increased 6- to 30-fold in PC3 cells exposed to vorinostat or vorinostat plus VSV. expression levels of ATG101, ATG7, and GABARAPL1 were 2- to 5-fold lower in vorinostat- or vorinostat-plus-VSV-treated cells stably knocked down for RE l-Luc and shRel cells were treated with VSV with or without vorinostat for 24 h (D) or 48 h (E) levels of autophagic vesicles or apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry using the Cyto-ID autophagy Detection Kit. the number of annexin V-positive Ctrl-Luc cells increased to 66%. only a modest increase in shRel autophagic cells was observed. apoptosis was observed only in cells exposed to VSV plus vorinostat. autophagy can positively or negatively modulate the innate immune response to viral infection. treatment with 3-MA increased the mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes. no increase in the levels of proinflammatory interleukin 1A (IL-1A), IL-6, or IL-10 genes was observed. reversal of the immunosuppressive effect of vorinostat by 3-MA was further confirmed by immunoblotting. atg5+/+ (black bars) or Atg5/ (white bars) MEFs were exposed to the indicated concentrations of vorinostat and infected with VSV-GFP (MOI = 0.0001) viral replication was assessed 24 h later by flow cytometry. PC3 cells were exposed to the treatments indicated at the top. vorinostat treatment alone or in combination with VSV induced LC3 lipidation and degradation of SQSTM1 (48) in both cell lines, vorinostat treatment induced LC3 lipidation and degradation of SQSTM1 (48) in both cell lines, vorinostat treatment alone or in combination with VSV induced LC3 lipidation and degradation of SQST1. vorinostat or MS-275 was removed prior to VSV-GFP infection. the removal of vorinostat activated antiviral responses and inhibited viral replication. a subset of reversibly regulated genes was most prominent in the halted group. VSV replication was assessed 24 h after VSV infection. fluorescence signal was calculated for corrected total cell fluorescence. genes in panels B and C were selected based on ingenuity pathway analysis. the effect of vorinostat on increased protein acetylation was confirmed by 2-fold increases in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for total acetylated histones. no increase in fluorescence intensities was observed in experiments using panspecific antibodies targeting histones 3 and 4 or the RELA/p65 protein. ORC2 was used as loading control for chromatin-bound proteins. PC3 cells were exposed to DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 24 h. antibody targeting K310 of RELA/p65 or pan-RELA/p65 antibody was used for detection of acetylated lysine or total protein. a 3- to 6-fold increase in nuclear retention of RELA/p65 was observed in cells treated with vorinostat or vorinostat plus VSV. however, increased nuclear retention of RELA/p65 was reversed in cells treated with vorinostat, VSV, and BAY11. cotreatment with BAY11 dramatically decreased the number of GFP-positive cells. PC3 cells treated with VSV (MOI = 0.01) with or without vorinostat (5 M) for 24 h were also pretreated with 10 M BAY11 for 1 h where indicated. THOC1 was used as a loading control for the nuclear fraction. PC3 cells were pretreated with DMSO (black bars), MS-275 (2 M) (dark-gray bars), or vorinostat (5 M) with or without BAY11 (10 M) and infected with VSV-GFP (MOI = 0.01), as indicated below the graphs, for 24 h. Y11 cell viability was measured by flow cytometry (A) or plaque assay (B) cells stably transfected with leGO-1xT vector expressing shRNA that targets expression of RELA/p65 (shRel) or a control shRNA targeting expression of luciferase (Ctrl-Luc) were infected with VSV. viral replication was measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 4D), plaque assay (Fig. 4E), and qPCR of viral RNA (Fig. 4F) expression levels of ATG101, ATG7, and GABARAPL1 were 2- to 5-fold lower in vorinostat- or vorinostat-plus-VSV-treated cells stably knocked down for RELA/p65. the autophagy-related genes indicated by the stars were found to possess one or more RELA/p65 binding motifs. qPCR assessment of mRNA levels for ATG101, ATG7, and GABARAPL1 genes in PC3 shRel or Ctrl-Luc cells were examined for induction of autophagy by Cyto-ID staining of autophagic vesicles (46) and for apoptosis by annexin V staining at 24 or 48 h after exposure to VSV with or without vorinostat. however, induction of autophagy was observed for vorinostat-treated cells with or without VSV infection. apoptosis is a direct consequence of VSV oncolysis and not vorinostat-induced autophagy. at 48 h, only 15% of vorinostat-treated Ctrl-Luc cells were annexin V positive. autophagy-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were infected with VSV. the reversal of the immunosuppressive effect of vorinostat by 3-MA was confirmed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated STAT1, IFIT1, MX1, and ISG15 in Ctrl-Luc and shRel cells. expression of VSV proteins and markers of apoptosis was upregulated in Luc-Ctrl cells, but not in shRel or Ctrl-Luc cells treated with 3-MA. PC3 cells exposed to VSV (MOI = 0.01) and vorinostat (5 M) with or without 5, 7.5, or 10 mM 3-MA were exposed to the treatments indicated at the top. antiviral signaling and apoptotic markers were assessed by immunoblotting. cell viability was measured by flow cytometry as a percentage of GFP and annexin V double-negative cells. DU145 and HCT116 cells were exposed to the treatments indicated above the gels. autophagy markers were assessed by immunoblotting. acetylation of K310 is required for full transcriptional activity (43), acetylation of K314 and K315 regulates the specificity of gene expression (52), and acetylation of K122 and K123 reduces DNA binding capacity (53). lysines may play a role in nuclear shuttling and sequestration, specificity of target gene expression, and/or regulation of DNA binding affinity. autophagy can also contribute to oncolysis. adenovirus and autophagy inducers greatly improved OV antitumor efficacy in glioblastoma cell lines and glioma xenograft models. the NF-B-regulated suppression of innate immune responses mediated by the autophagic pathway. the NF-B-regulated suppression of innate immune responses mediated by the autophagic pathway. this led to the upregulation of both type I IFN and cytokine expression and a subsequent decrease in VSV replication even in the presence of vorinostat."}
