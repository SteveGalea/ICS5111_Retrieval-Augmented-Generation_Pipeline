Berberine could inhibit high glucose and insulin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, accompanied by increasing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and NO concentration, which elevated PPAR and eNOS. also has an effect against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury by suppressing myocardial apoptosis and inflammation via inhibition of the Rho/ROCK pathway. glucose concentration 1 HepG2 cells and betaTC3 cells insulin independent but has no effect on insulin secretion 5 to 200 M (Xie X et al. 2011) Activating glucose uptake 1 3T3-L1 adipocytes Activating GLUT1 through AMPK stimulation 1, 5 M (Kim et al. 2007) T1DM 1 nonobese diabetic mice Protcting pancreatic islets and serum lipids 50, 150, 500 mg/kg, 98 d (Chueh & Lin 2011) Treating T2DM 1 HF diet and STZ induced rats Lowering RBP4 levels and up-regulating the expression of GLUT4 protein in tissues 380 mg/kg, 28 d (Zhang et al. 2008) the expression of the glucose transporter protein (GLUT) is a key factor in the intracellular transport of glucose and is closely linked to cellular energy metabolism. the level of GLUT1 protein was increased in 3T3-L1 cells. the results showed that glucose consumption by HepG2 cells was increased from 32% to 60% by berberine, which was insulin independent but had no influence on insulin secretion. another study showed the GnRH-glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and MAPK pathways in the intestines might be involved in the mechanisms of berberine to modulate glucose metabolism. berberine improved insulin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of IRS-1 and recruitment of p85 to IRS-1. in insulin-resistant cells, berberine improved insulin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the recruitment of p85 to IRS-1. berberine could promote the secretion of insulin by increasing GLP-1 release or by stimulating pancreatic cells. the levels of AR, SOD, GSH-px and GSH increased while MDA decreased, indicating that oxidation was inhibited. several cellular kinases, as well as signalling pathways, were verified to be pivotal for berberine\u2019s activity in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation to treat DM. berberine selectively enriched the propionic acid producing bacteria and intestinal barrier repair bacteria Ackermansia. CR decoction promoted butyric acid producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium and Oscillospira. the upregulation of GLUT4 expression and downregulation of Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) are also involved in glucose uptake. the results showed that glucose consumption by HepG2 cells was increased from 32% to 60% by berberine. berberine can suppress the activation of PTP1B to increase the phosphorylation of INSR. berberine improved insulin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the recruitment of p85 to IRS-1. proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, iNOS, MCP-1 and COX-2, were observed. the levels of AR, SOD, GSH-px and GSH increased, while MDA decreased, indicating that oxidation was inhibited. berberine has been demonstrated to treat DM by modulating the structure and diversity of gut microbiota. CR alkaloid treatment avoided a decline in the diversity of gut microbes in obese mice. berberine selectively enriched the propionic acid producing bacteria and intestinal barrier repair bacteria Ackermansia. CR decoction promoted butyric acid producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium and Oscillospira. CR and its active ingredients can prevent cancer by blocking the cell cycle, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting migration and invasion. hepatocellular carcinoma 1 HepG2 cells Promoting apoptosis through the NF-B p65 pathway 10, 50, 100 M. hepatocellular carcinoma 1 HepG2 and MHCC97-L cells Downregulating the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway 300, 150 M at 24 h and 48 h.

MG63, SW1353, Saos-2, and U-2OS cells Downregulating expression of CDK4, cyclin D1, VE-cadherin and integrin \u00df3 diminishing STAT3 phosphorylation in vivo: 50 mg/kg, 24 d. treating breast cancer 3 MDA-MB-231 cells Anti-metastatic function through down-regulation of MMP-9 in combination with the increase of TIMP-1 16, 32, 64 M. treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma berberine hydrochloride CNE-1 cells Blocking proliferation, migration and invasion, inducing apoptosis IC50: 31.5 M. berberine induces apoptosis in human colonic carcinoma cell line SW620. in pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and MIA-PaCa2. berberine also regulated the activities of Bcl-2 and Bax in colon cancer cells. cPLA-COX2 and JAK2/STAT3 signalling was inhibited in liver and colon cancer cells HT-29. berberine also promoted the Fas/FasL signalling pathway. he then triggered the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 precursors. in osteosarcoma, berberine treatment led to G1/S cell cycle arrest in p53-presenting cells. another CR component, jatrorrhizine, could inhibit proliferation and neovascularization of metastatic melanoma cells. berberine (50 M) could act as a RhoGTPases inhibitor in HONE1 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell. inhibition of RhoGTPase by CRE, as well as by berberine (100-200 M), might also result in blockade of ROCK signalling in hepatoma cells. berberine may also inhibit the adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial cells by increasing the proportion of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) berberine showed anti-angiogenesis effects on animals that were orthotopically implanted with hepatocellular carcinoma. CR and its compounds could be used to treat diseases of nervous system, digestive system, skeleton, skin and hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and aging-related disorders. Berberine could ameliorate -amyloid pathology, gliosis, and cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease transgenic mouse model. the protective effect of coptisine (57 mg/kg) on the gastric mucosa was significantly better than that of 100 mg/kg berberine (Feng et al. 2007). berberine has the potential to alleviate premenopausal syndrome by decreasing oxidative stress. the intestinal flora exerts significant effect on the enterohepatic circulation of the metabolites. only 0.013% of berberine is eliminated directly in urine after oral administration. in some pathological conditions, the pharmacokinetic processes are altered. male diabetic SD rats CRE (i.g.) 1.3 g/kg 1 AUC0\u201324 (ngh/mL): 255.10 8.04 (Yu et al. 2008) Cmax (ngmL-1): 24.97 8.39 Tmax (h): 3.10 1.52 MRT (h): 9.44 1.52 3 AUC0\u201324 (ngh/mL): 35.53 10.32 Cmax (ng/mL): 4.88 7.28 1.71 8 AUC0\u201324 (ngh/mL): 8.17 3.30 Cmax (ng/mL): 1.30 0.23 Tmax (h): 3.00 1.06 MRT (h): 6.84 1.45 4 AUC0\u201324 (ngh/mL): 22.02 4.39 Cmax (ng/mL): 2.93 1.14 Tmax (h): 4.30 0.61 Male pseudo germ-free Wistar rats 1 (i.g.) 40 male Wistar rats berberine hydrochloride (i.g.) 25 mg/kg 1 AUC0-t (ngmin/mL): 2,763.43 203.14 (Gong et al. 2014) Cmax (ng/mL): 18.53 0.61 Tmax (min): 15.00 0.00 T1/2,z (min): 941.45 60.39 Vd/Fz (L/h/kg): 3,270.57 58.32 Male 280 mg/kg 1 AUC (gh/L): 777.29 150.10, Cmax (g/L): 15.46 4.20, Tmax (h): 3.71 0.95, t1/2(h): 0.63 0.14, t1/2 (h): 34.82 14.36, CL (h): 2.64 0.55, Vd (L): 125.41 32.55 Male Wistar rats CRE (i.g.) 1.2 g/kg 6940 206, Cmax (ng/g): 272 12, T1/2K (h): 0.215 0.063 T1/2 (h): 12.0 1.5, Tmax (h): 3.67 0.48 Plasma: AUC (ngh/mL): 473 18, T1/2 (h): 0.227 0.017, T1/2 (h): 1.13 0.18 Vd (mL/kg): 2400 300 CL (mLkg/h): 6400 200 Male after oral intake of berberine, the AUC0-t in mice with PI-IBS was higher than that in normal mice. pharmacokinetic parameters altered remarkably when magnoflorine was administered in a CR decoction. magnoflorine showed lower bioavailability and faster absorption and elimination rates. berberine aggravated jaundice and kernicterus in neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. in 2012, researchers found no organ toxicity or electrolyte imbalance in 20 patients administered with CR at a daily dose of 3 g for 1055 patient-days. the ban of Chinese herbal medicines rich in berberine was officially lifted. a subchronic toxicity study found no mortality or morbidity was observed. rats received repeated oral administration of CR for 13 weeks. no mortality or remarkable clinical signs were observed. CR and berberine have a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect. this suggests a combination of CR and conventional antibacterial drugs might exert a greater effect. these properties are mainly attributed to berberine, coptisine, palmatine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine and magnoflorine. more work should be devoted to investigating the pharmacokinetics and features of CR and its active components. related target-organ toxicity evaluations are lacking. berberine is not only the main active component but also the primary toxic component."}
