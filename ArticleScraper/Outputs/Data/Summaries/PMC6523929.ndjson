{"summary": "major histocompatibility complex (MHC), an essential component of the vertebrate immune system, is an ideal fitness-relevant marker [5]. the remarkable level of polymorphism in MHC is thought to result from sexual selection, maternal\u2013fetal interactions, pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) and demographic processes such as genetic drift. increased MHC differentiation across populations has also been reported. this supports the dominant role of fluctuating selection. previous studies of MHC variation were focused at the allele level. the crested ibis was once believed to be extinct in the wild until a tiny population of seven birds was rediscovered in 1981 at Yangxian, China. the total number of crested ibis has now increased from seven to over 2000. previous studies using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers on small Nini populations revealed extremely low levels of polymorphism. the class II and II genes are alternately organized into one to four elementary \u201c\u201d units [20,37,38]. Phylogenetic analysis on the four \u201c\u201d units identified two clusters [20] corresponding to the two reported ancestral avian MHC-II lineages (DAB1 and DAB2) generated by duplication [19]. this results provided a solid foundation for our study.

SSCP-HD profile containing alleles of five class I loci was constructed from the positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones stored in our laboratory [20,42], and was verified by profile reconstitution [40] for class II genotyping, the eight genes were classified according to their orthologies [20]. s were designed (IIA2e2, IIB2e2) to exclude the possibility of amplification failure of potential alleles. representative genotypes (3 samples for each) were collected for each genotyping and amplified by 8 additional valid primers designed for different regions. PCR-SSCP analysis was performed 3 times for each primer pair per DNA sample. haplotypes were deduced using pedigree information provided by reserves. the remainder lacking parentage data were phased according to the most frequent haplotypes in their respective populations. the crested ibis is strictly monogamous, but captive cages are sometimes occupied by >1 breeding pairs. sequences of II genes using two sets of primers (3UT1 and 3UT2) were cloned and sequenced. PCR products of twelve homozygotes were cloned and subjected to primer-walking Sanger sequencing. each segment was verified by 3 independent rounds of long and accurate PCR. Nini-II exon 2 obtained above were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm. we integrated the three DBB loci as one locus with four alleles. the selection parameter, which estimates the ratio of the nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN) to the synonymous substitution rate (dS), was calculated, and the Z-test with Jukes-Cantor correction was performed. gene was detected by the RDP beta 4.16 package [50] using seven methods: RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq. recombination events identified by at least two methods were then verified and refined by several methods according to the manual. the plot of the Q matrix was generated by distruct 1.1 [55]. neighbor-joining trees for both markers were constructed to evaluate the genetic distances among populations in Populations 1.2.32 [56] using chord distance. SSCP-HD profile containing alleles of five class I loci was constructed from the positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones stored in our laboratory [20,42], and was verified by profile reconstitution [40]. SSCP-HD profile was supplemented with novel alleles obtained by extracting and cloning new HD bands from genotyping gels. for class II genotyping, the eight genes were classified according to their orthologies. for DAA and DAB, respective locus-specific primers were designed (IIA1e2, IIB1e2) for DBAs (DBA1, DBA2, and DBA3) and DBBs (DBB1, DBB2, and DBB3). representative genotypes were collected for each genotyping and amplified by 8 additional valid primers designed for different regions. haplotypes combining all class II loci and the major class I locus were tested by Arlequin 3.5. individual haplotypes were inferred from genotypes both manually and by multiple programs. most haplotypes were deduced using pedigree information provided by reserves. the BAC clone containing HT01 [20] and an HT01/HT02 heterozygote were chosen as positive controls. the PCR products of twelve homozygotes were cloned and subjected to primer-walking Sanger sequencing (for both clones and PCR products) all pairs of loci were tested using the exact test (Bonferroni correction) in GENEPOP 4.0 [47]. one locus was excluded because of its significant LD with another locus in certain populations. two independent chains were performed for 1,000,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 100. the first 10% of iterations were abandoned as a burn-in. a preliminary scan for recombination was performed with p 0.05. the admixture model with sampling location as a prior (LOCPRIOR) was used to detect the population structure. an MCMC chain of 1,000,000 generations was run with an initial burn-in of 100,000 generations. the correlation between MHC-G\u2019ST and microsatellite-G\u2019ST was tested using Pearson product-moment correlation in SPSS 20.0. results 3.1. Characterization of multilocus MHC haplotypes. three DBA genes share the same exon 2; DBB2 and DBB3 share the same exon 2. the multilocus MHC haplotype consisted of all class II loci and the major class I locus [20]. Among these loci, only DAB and UAA were polymorphic. three individuals (2 from SD and 1 from BJ) showed inconsistent results with the above-inferred haplotypes. these results should be considered invalid and biased by the relative frequencies of HT04 and HT05. a total of seven haplotypes were inferred from genotype data. HT01 was the haplotype of the target BAC clone reported previously. the class II regions of HTs02/06, HTs03/07, and HTs04/05 were identical to the three reported Nini class II haplotypes HP3, HP2, and HP1 respectively. dN = 0.003, dS = 0.001, p = 0.031) all substitutions on ABS of DBB were nonsynonymous. a higher mean value of was obtained ( = 19.40 per codon) for DBB. thirteen positively selected sites were identified. introns 1, 5, and 3\u2032UTR were far longer in \u201ctype A\u201d than in \u201ctype B\u201d. intron 1: 660 vs. 285 bp, intron 5: 171 vs. 84 bp, 3\u2032UTR: 244 vs.199 bp. black boxes indicate highly similar homologous regions. HT01 was only present in group 1 and the only two HT06 detected were products of recombination. HTs02/06 most prevalent in Wild, LGT, and DQ.

HT02 and HT03 were favored in the presence of DAB*02 and DAB*03. the manually inferred haplotypes were consistent with the estimates from PHASE and Arlequin (intra-species level) two full-length DBB2 alleles varying in exon 3 were found in HT01 and HTs02/06. compared to the four units in HT01, there are only three in HTs02/06, two in HTs03/07, and one in HTs04/05. HTs02/06, HTs03/07, and HTs04/05 were identical to the three reported Nini class II haplotypes HP3, HP2, and HP1 respectively. the alignment of the Nini-II exon 2 amino acid sequences clearly indicated two lineages (DAB and DBBs) by the first 13 residues. crosses represent putative antigen binding sites (ABS) inferred from Jardetzky, et al. [60] and Stern, et al. [61]. \"a\" and \"b\" denote sites under positive selection for DAB and DBBs respectively. recombination was indicated by their mosaic structures. BB3*01. numbers on exon 2 represent different nucleotide sequences. dark and light grey boxes represent DAA and DBAs respectively. breakpoints of recombination are shown by black crosses. mozygote 1 5 34 34 23 27 9 45 177 Heterozygote 2 3 20 14 22 8 9 41 117 Haplotype frequency (%) HT01 6.3 7.4 5.2 10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.9 HT02 43.8 28.7 44.8 51.1 14.3 25.0 28.5 33.2 HT03 25.0 26.9 21.9 18.9 60.0 36.1 32.0 30.8 HT04 12.5 19.4 15.6 6.7 2.9 22.2 3 0.05 of the eleven microsatellite loci, eight were dimorphic and three were trimorphic. no population exhibited a significant deficit or excess of heterozygotes for both MHC and microsatellites except BJ which showed significant heterozygote deficiency for MHC. each individual is represented by a vertical bar, vertically partitioned into segments with lengths proportional to the individual\u2019s estimated membership fraction of each of the three inferred clusters indicated by different colors. the seven populations are separated by black lines and can be divided into three groups based on the proportion of membership of the three clusters.

HTs02/06, HTs04/05, and HT01 were successively generated from HTs03/07 through two rounds of unequal crossing over events between DAB and DBB3. the other five haplotypes all contain 1\u20132 recombinant II sequences. the other five haplotypes all contain 1\u20132 recombinant II sequences. despite structural diversity of Nini-MHC haplotypes, most loci were monomorphic. the class II genes showed higher polymorphism than class I genes. this is thought to be associated with the stronger selection and gene conversion at class II genes. d fox populations within only 10\u201320 generations from 10 individuals. we call for long-term monitoring of adaptive diversity in Nini populations. d fox populations within only 10\u201320 generations from 10 individuals. the founder effect resulted from improper management is a major cause of genetic drift in conservation programs. it is necessary to investigate and interpret the population structure of the crested ibis after 38 years of conservation practices. in 2002, most individuals are descendants of a single breeding pair with high reproductive rate but low MHC dissimilarity. YX and BJ both originated from the wild around the same time, but their different management histories have led to a great distance between BJ (but not YX) and Wild in the NJ trees. populations should be established from enough founders with maximum MHC dissimilarity. group 1, which contained only birds with HT01 and abundance of HTs02/06, should have more genetic connectivity with groups 2/3 which suffer from limited genetic resources and are rich in HTs03/07. haplotype inference may be hindered for populations with masses of alleles. haplotype inference may be hindered for populations with masses of alleles. whole-genome sequencing has played a promising role in conservation of species including the crested ibis."}
