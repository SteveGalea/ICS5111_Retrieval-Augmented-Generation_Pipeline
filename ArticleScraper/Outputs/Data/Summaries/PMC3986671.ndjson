{"summary": "study was aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. the two systems may reflect distinct response pathways to risk. risk-as-analysis (cognitive estimates) and risk-as-feeling (affective estimates). heuristics and risk-as-feeling hypotheses imply that affect quickly and more efficiently guides cognitive risk analysis and behavior. ten cross-sectional surveys spanning the epidemic wave of 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in Hong Kong were rapidly implemented. the aim of this study was to compare the strength and stability of associations between affective and cognitive measures of risk and the adoption of health protective behaviors. 13 cross-sectional surveys (S1-S13) covering the entire first wave of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. the first two surveys (S1 and S2) conducted between April and May were excluded because of incompatibility with later surveys. one adult aged 18 or above within each household was randomly selected based on a Kish Grid and invited for the telephone interview. four measures (state anxiety, anticipated worry, experienced worry and current worry about A/H1N1 infection) were classified as affective measures. four other measures (perceived absolute susceptibility and perceived relative susceptibility to A/H1N1 infection) were classified as cognitive estimates of risk. anxiety Respondents\u2019 anxiety level was assessed with a previously validated state-anxiety scale of the state-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) the measure included ten items asking about ten general feeling statements and thereby the proportions of missing data for anxiety in the table. perceived absolute susceptibility to A/H1N1 Respondents estimated their personal likelihood of contracting A/H1N1 in the coming months throughout the ten surveys. this item was slightly changed to personal likelihood of contracting A/H1N1 relative to another (unspecified) person in the general population. previous analyses showed trends for psycho-behavioral associations were similar across the responses range on all the above risk measures [16]. therefore, these responses were dichotomized as either above or below a threshold for subsequent analyses in order to facilitate comparison. all multilevel models were adjusted for age, gender, education, marital status and place of birth. only one psycho-behavioral association was assessed in each model. analyses were conducted using STATA software (version 10.1; STATA Corp., College Station, TX) the IRB waived written informed consent in lieu of verbal consent given the format of these ten telephone surveys. the sample sizes for each survey ranged between 1,000-1,404, with response rates of 65.6%-72.7% [16]. surveys were conducted every two weeks with data collection completed within 3-5 days for each survey. 9 S10 S11 S12 S13 Missing rang% c Totally missing% Anxietya 0.20\u20131.29 0.65 Anticipated worry 0.10\u20131.41 0.59 Experienced worry 0.50\u20131.12 0.73 Perceived absolute susceptibility 1.02\u20136.63 5.63 Perceived relative susceptibility. proportions of missing data for anxiety in the table were the highest proportion of missing data of the item among the ten statements. anxiety Respondents\u2019 anxiety level was assessed with a previously validated state-anxiety scale of the state-Trait Anxiety Inventory. positive feeling statements were reversely coded and then the mean scores of the ten items (possible range 1 - 4) were calculated for subsequent analyses to overcome the problems of randomly missing items. anticipated worry about A/H1N1 Respondents were asked to rate their worry about possibly developing A/H1N1 symptoms within the next 24 hours the frequencies of three protective behaviors against A/H1N1 were polled throughout the ten surveys. these were avoiding crowded places, maintaining good indoor ventilation and disinfecting the household frequently. responses were dichotomized as either above or below a threshold for subsequent analyses. experienced worry about A/H1N1 Respondents were asked to recall whether they had experienced any worry over the past week about contracting A/H1N1. this measure was retrospective. perceived absolute susceptibility to A/H1N1 Respondents estimated their personal likelihood of contracting A/H1N1 in the coming months. these behavioral outcomes were dichotomized as \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d for subsequent analyses. previous analyses showed trends for psycho-behavioral associations were similar across the responses range on all the above risk measures. random-effect multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the pooled effect of each psycho-behavioral association across the ten surveys. ten surveys included a total of 10,345 subjects after excluding 92 (0.9%) subjects with ILI. perceived absolute susceptibility and perceived relative susceptibility to A/H1N1 infection had the highest proportions of missing data throughout the surveys. the patterns of psycho-behavior associations were similar for the three types of health protective behaviors. the upper four forest plots illustrate the associations between affective measures and adoption of protective behaviors. the lower four illustrate the associations between cognitive measures and adoption of protective behaviors. .64\u20133.78)*** 2.57 (2.07\u20133.18)*** 2.74 (2.22\u20133.39)*** 1.33 (1.14\u20131.55)*** 1.40 (1.16\u20131.70)*** 1.13 (0.93\u20131.36) Perceived relative susceptibility. all odds ratios were adjusted by age, gender, education, marital status and birth place. perceived relative susceptibility seemed to have stronger associations with avoiding crowds and household disinfection than perceived absolute susceptibility. no change was seen in associations between perceived relative susceptibility compared to another person. perceived higher A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS was more likely to be significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors in later (S10-S13) than earlier surveys. the patterns of psycho-behavior associations were similar for the three types of health protective behaviors. for each of the three figures, the upper four forest plots illustrate the associations between affective measures and adoption of protective behaviors. the lower four illustrate the associations between cognitive measures and adoption of protective behaviors. all odds ratios were adjusted by age, gender, education, marital status and birth place. all odds ratios were adjusted by age, gender, education, marital status and birth place. current worry and experienced worry had strongest associations with protective behaviors. association between perceived relative susceptibility and adoption of protective behaviors in later (S10-S13) was more likely to be significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors in later (S10-S13) than earlier surveys. perceived A/H1N1 infectivity relative to seasonal influenza was generally significantly associated with adoption of health protective behaviors. overall reported state anxiety levels remained quite stable and consistently low throughout the A/H1N1 epidemic [16], indicating a floor effect, suggesting that a low level of anxiety has little effect on these behaviors. other affective measures including anticipated worry, experienced worry and current worry generally involve less intense affective components compared with anxiety. perceived susceptibility measured in this relative way involves social comparison. more cognitive processing is associated with greater risk estimates and psychological distress [28] a series of consecutive cross-sectional surveys to investigate the psycho-behavioral associations is a better option than using a single cross-sectional survey. there may be concerns about the generalizability of our findings to more severe RIDEs. a degree of risk fatigue may have subsequently set in. risk estimates may inform individual behavioral change later in the RIDE epidemic trajectory. recognizing that the public may not show expected \u201crational\u201d behaviors during RIDEs is important. therefore, risk probabilities alone are unlikely to be sufficient to motivate protective behaviors. authors declare that they have no competing interests. funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of manuscript. public Opinion Poll, The University of Hong Kong, conducted telephone interview."}
