{"summary": "at least 350 million people are HBV carriers and are at high risk for developing hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. strong and polyclonal CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are essential for the clearance of HBV infections from the liver[2] patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may have a potential high risk for HBV infection due to the lack of adequate immunity. LB/c mice lead to transient HBV replication and gene expression in the liver [8], [9], this system could be used to analyze the influence of the immunosuppressive agents on HBV replication. transient treatment with immunosuppressive agents led to long-term HBV persistence with a high level of viral replication. pressive agents or saline were administered intraperitoneally 1 week prior to the HI at the following doses in a volume of 0.25 ml. dex (Hubei Tianyao pharma, China), 10 mg/kg/d; CsA (Novartis, Germany) was diluted in saline, and a gavage was administered 1 week prior to HI at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d. cAb was calculated with the formula 100 (index calibrator mean rate - sample rate). the HBV DNA levels were quantified by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using SYBR Green dye. a serum sample containing a known concentration of HBV DNA was used as a positive control. the ELISPOT assay was performed using the mouse IFN- precoated ELISPOT Kit (Dakewe, China) the spots were counted using the ImmunoSpot analyzer and the supporting ImmunoSpot software (Cellular Technology, USA) the results are presented as spot-forming cells per 2105 cells. experimental animals were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions in the experimental animal centre of tongji medical college, Huazhong university of science and technology. all surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. HI Mice received an HI of pAAV/HBV1.2. hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus surface antibody (HBsAb) and hepatitis B virus core antibody (HBcAb) were detected using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) system. the percentage of inhibition of HBcAb was calculated with the formula 100 (index calibrator mean rate - sample rate) the splenocytes were separated by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation. the splenocytes were cultured at a density of 2105 cells per well. the splenocytes were then cultured at a concentration of 0.5 g/ml. -actin mRNA levels were calculated in the same manner and used for normalization. the expression levels were given as the copy number/100,000 copies of -actin mRNA. differences between two groups or among multiple groups were analyzed. mice were treated with saline or the immunosuppressive drugs DEX, CsA, CYP, or MMF from 1 week before the HI to 10 weeks after the HI. the levels of serum HBsAg (circle) and HBV DNA (triangles) in the mice after the HI were detected using ECLIA, with the cut off values of 1.0 COI (dashed line) HBcAb and HBsAb were measured at d0, w7, w10, and w26. the HBcAbs were detectable at w7, w10, and w26 both in the control mice and in the CsA-treated mice. some mice even became negative for the HBsAg and HBV DNA at w26. 8 post HI mice were treated with HBsAg until w6 and w8. the HBsAg remained positive in the majority of mice treated with CsA until w6 and w8. this data indicated that CsA treatment from 1 week before HI causes HBV persistence for at least 6 months. in the liver were present at w1 in the livers from all the mice in the three groups and became undetectable at w3 and w10 in the saline-treated mice and the CsA-4w mice. the mice were treated with saline (Saline) or CsA from 1 week before the HI to 4 weeks (CsA-4w) or 10 weeks (CsA-10w) after the HI. the levels of CD3, CD8, IFN-, Fas-L, and perforin were significantly elevated at w2. the virus was ultimately eliminated at w3 from both the serum and the liver. at w2, all the molecules elevated in the saline-treated mice were suppressed. the expression of the T cell-related molecules was compared in livers from the saline- or CsA-treated mice. transient CsA treatment leads to the suppression of the intrahepatic T cell response and allows long-term HBV persistence in this mouse model. the mice were treated with CsA from 1 week before the HI to 10 weeks after the HI. two weeks later, the mice were adoptive transferred with the splenocytes from nave or pHBc-immunized mice. the levels of serum HBsAg (B), HBsAb (C) and HBcAb (D) in the mice were detected at the indicated time points. g and HBV DNA in sera from mice treated with DEX, CsA or CYP maintained at the high levels of approximately 100 cut off index (COI) and 106\u20137 copies/ml, respectively. the sera levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg in the MMF-treated mice decreased gradually and became negative within 4 weeks post HI in 1 animal. the HBV DNA became negative within 4 weeks, and the HBsAg was eliminated within 6 weeks in mice treated with DEX-treated mice became negative for HBV DNA within 4 weeks after DEX withdrawal. the HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were maintained at less than 10 COI. the CYP-treated mice were persistently positive for HBsAg and HBV DNA until 26 weeks post HI. CsA was selected to treat the HI mice from 1 week before the HI to different time points post HI. at w14, the control mice and the mice treated with CsA for less than 4 weeks post HI were HBsAg negative. the majority of mice treated with CsA until w6 and w8 post HI were HBsAg positive. the saline-treated mice rapidly cleared HBsAg and HBV DNA from the peripheral. HBsAg and HBV DNA persisted during the entire observation period. the saline-treated mice were undetectable at w3 and w10 in the mice. mRNA levels of the T cell markers (e.g., CD3 and CD8), the antiviral cytokines (e.g., IFN- and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-]) and the cytotoxic molecules (e.g., Fas ligand [Fas-L] and perforin) were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. mice were treated with saline or CsA from 1 week before the HI to 4 weeks (CsA-4w) or 10 weeks (CsA-10w) after the HI. the liver samples were collected from the mice (n3) at the indicated time points. serum HBsAg and liver HBcAg were persistently detected in the control and nave mice. HBsAb and the cellular responses to HBcAg were unchanged in the mice from both groups. treatment with four immunosuppressants had different effects on HBV replication in vivo. hepatitis B replication was not eliminated in the immunosuppressant-treated mice. this was consistent with the effect of immunosuppressants on HBV replication in vivo. calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus was potent in inhibiting CMV-specific Th1 cytokines. MMF was recently found to inhibit the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. these properties may also contribute to the reduction of HBV DNA in MMF-treated mice. pAAV/HBV1.2 could not be properly measured by intracellular staining and flow cytometry analysis. we analyzed the intrahepatic mRNA expression of the molecules closely related to the CD8 T cell immune response. the expression of CD3, CD8, IFN-, and perforin was increased after the HBV transfection. this was consistent with the findings in the woodchuck liver with acute woodchuck hepatitis virus infection. specific cellular immune responses to the hepadnaviral core antigen were considered critical for controlling the HBV infection. the adoptive transfer of splenocytes from mice immunized with an HBcAg expression plasmid effectively enhanced the cellular responses to the HBV proteins and suppressed HBV replication in the HBV-persistent mice. mice were treated with saline or the immunosuppressive drugs DEX, CsA, CYP, or MMF from 1 week before HI. levels of serum HBsAg (A) and HBV DNA (B) were compared at d4 post HI. the cells were harvested and stained with PE-labeled CD8 antibody and APC-labeled IFN- antibody. the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry."}
