{"summary": "influenza viruses and the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year (1\u20133). both influenza and SARS exhibit seasonality, with increased incidence during wintertime in temperate regions and perhaps during the rainy season in tropical regions. AH explains 50% and 90% of the variability in influenza virus transmission and survival, respectively, whereas RH explains only 12% and 36%, respectively, of the variability. a causality analysis of global flu incidence data has shown that AH is a stronger driver than RH for virus inactivation. we exposed an enveloped virus to seven environmentally relevant RHs and four temperatures to test the hypothesis that temperature does not have a significant effect on infectivity. resulting data set is larger than has been obtained previously and enables a robust analysis that goes beyond simple linear regression. at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, Phi6 infectivity was highest at RHs of less than 60% and greater than 85%. at 37\u00b0C, the relative infectious ratio was 3 log lower at 75% RH than at 98% RH. at 37\u00b0C, there were 6-log and 2-log losses in Phi6 infectivity at 75% and 98% RH. AHs above 22 g m3 correspond to a temperature of 37\u00b0C. AH ranged between 8.8 and 37.1 g m3. standard error bars (n = 3) are shown; they are small enough to not be visible for many points. multiple linear regressions of infectivity against temperature, RH, and AH revealed that the slopes for temperature and AH were statistically significant, but that for RH was not. the overall fit of the multiple regression model was poor, with an R2 of 0.34. the random forest was the most successful model applied. the correlation coefficient was 0.98, and there is no significant difference between the two distributions (P = 0.095). a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that there is no significant difference between the two distributions (P = 0.095). the correlation coefficient is 0.98, and there is no significant difference between the two distributions (P = 0.095). relative infectious ratio was 3 log lower at 75% RH than at 98% RH. at 37\u00b0C, there were 6-log and 2-log losses in Phi6 infectivity at 75% and 98% RH respectively. AH ranged between 2.7 and 41.6 g m3 with temperatures ranging between 14\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. temperature had a significant effect on Phi6 infectivity across all temperatures below 34\u00b0C (P 0.0001) but at temperatures above 34\u00b0C, there was no effect of temperature on virus infectivity (P = 0.1293) the random forest model applied to a log10 reduction in infectivity did not perform as well; the percentage of explained variance was 0.59. we measured virus stability in both droplets and aerosols under the same conditions, and the relationship between infectivity and RH was the same in both. this study was designed specifically to compare the importance of RH, AH, and temperature as predictors of enveloped virus survival in droplets. results suggest that in determining virus infectivity, the interaction between RH, AH, and temperature is complex and not easily captured by linear or log-linear regressions. study used 1-l droplets that are relevant to disease transmission by \u201clarge droplets\u201d but are much larger than what are considered \u201caerosols\u201d. larger droplets can take a long time to evaporate, especially at high humidity, while very small droplets are able to evaporate in milliseconds (37). removing the residual moisture from influenza virus to 2% enabled the virus to maintain its titer level for 13 to 20 days at 28\u00b0C and 2.5 to 3.5 days at 45\u00b0C. removing too much moisture produced a less protective effect; when dried to a residual moisture of 0.4%, the influenza titer was only maintained for 2 days at 28\u00b0C. if the RH is constant at 60% in a building, our results predict that virus infectivity would be 7.5% at 19\u00b0C but only 2.8% at 25\u00b0C, a >2-fold reduction in infectivity. by controlling RH in the built environment, we might be able to create conditions that are less favorable for virus survival in droplets. a low RH is favorable for virus survival in buildings such as homes, offices, schools, and hospitals. bacteriophage Phi6 is an appropriate surrogate for infectious enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza, and SARS) there are some potential limitations to this study. the advantages of working with Phi6 include its biosafety level 1 biohazard rating. we have previously hypothesized that mucin glycoproteins might provide a protective effect for viruses against changes in environmental conditions. this study examined only one aspect, the effect of humidity and temperature on virus stability in droplets and aerosols. other environmental factors, such as sunlight, wind, and rainfall, are also known or suspected to affect transmission. the bacteriophage Phi6 was a surrogate for influenza virus and other enveloped viruses. the host for the bacteriophage was Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. 75% was near the middle of the range (60 to 85% RH) in which we saw the largest virus inactivation. 75% was near the middle of the range (60 to 85% RH) in which we saw the largest virus inactivation. the working stock, spotting the droplets, and placing the cell culture dish into the RH chamber took place in a biological safety cabinet at approximately 20\u00b0C. after a 2-h incubation period, we returned the chamber to the BSC and removed the cell culture dish. we calculated the relative infectious ratio after aging Phi6 droplets at a given temperature, RH, and AH as relative infectious ratio (%) = NE/NC. NE and NC are the measured Phi6 concentrations (PFU ml1) for the exposed and control samples. we performed the droplet experiments as described above. bacteriophage Phi6 was a surrogate for influenza virus and other enveloped viruses. the host for Phi6 was Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. a sensor (HOBO Temp/RH 2.5% data logger, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) placed inside the chamber logged the temperature and RH. the temperature varied by no more than 1\u00b0C and the RH by no more than 2% during the incubation period. 500 l of TSB were added to each well containing droplets. they were placed in a 20\u00b0C freezer for 20 min before moving them to a 80\u00b0C freezer for long-term storage. i6 droplets at a given temperature, RH, and AH as relative infectious ratio (%) = NE/NC.
