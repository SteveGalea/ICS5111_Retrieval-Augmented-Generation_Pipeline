{"summary": "in vivo, these viruses infect primarily mature enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium. they are composed of a triple-layered protein capsid that surrounds the viral genome. the outermost layer is formed by VP7, which makes the smooth surface of the virus, and by the spike protein VP4 which functions as the virus attachment protein. RV cell entry is a multistep process involving cellular glycans for cell binding and several coreceptors during postattachment steps (5). the VP8 domain mediates the initial interaction of the virus with the cell surface, whereas VP5 and likely the surface glycoprotein VP7 interact with downstream coreceptors (5). all RV strains reach EEs in a process that depends on RAB5, EEA1, and probably on HRS and the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) (11). at the EE, the virus probably begins to be internalized into the endosomal lumen through the action of VPS4A. RVs have been proposed to interact with integrins 21, V3, and X2 and with the heat shock cognate protein hsc70. not all RV strains require integrins, while all the strains tested require hsc70 for efficient cell infection. most RVs tested, including human (Wa, DS-1, WI69) and animal (UK, YM, SA11-4S, nar3) strains, enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7, 9) the requirement for cholesterol and dynamin is also shared by those RVs that are internalized into MA104 cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (7). a single amino acid substitution (K187R) in VP8 INTRACELLULAR VESICULAR TRAFFIC Regardless of the nature of the cell surface receptor and the endocytic pathway used for cell internalization. all RVs tested seem to require a functional ESCRT system in MA104 as well as in colon carcinoma human Caco-2 cells. the requirement for the ESCRT machinery and the formation of ILVs is required (11) signal transduction ends when the receptor complex is sequestered by ILVs into endosomes. a recent report suggested that in BSC-1 cells, RRV enters the cytoplasmic space from endocytic vesicles without reaching EEs (16) the infectivity of all other RV strains tested, including nar3, depends on the expression of this GTPase. lysosomal acid hydrolases are delivered from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes by mannose-6-phosphate receptors (M6PRs), and recycling of M6PRs back to the Golgi network depends on the small GTPase Rab9 (18) cysteine cathepsins are also required for processing the capsid or the surface proteins of other viruses. RVs may require the low pH of LEs to enter the cell. preventing endosomal acidification with NH4Cl and other weak bases does not block the infection of RRV, but it reduces infectivity of RVs. most studies on RV biology have been carried out in nonpolarized MA104 cells. it remains to be determined if all the events observed in cultured cells occur in intestinal enterocytes during a natural infection. further structural studies of the surface proteins of the virus and their interaction with cellular receptors/coreceptors will be important tools to advance this field."}
