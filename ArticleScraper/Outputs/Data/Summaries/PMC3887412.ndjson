{"summary": "low replication fidelity is important for the survival of many RNA viruses. a mutant with increased fidelity of replication was unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions2 and a mutant arbovirus with decreased genetic diversity was also attenuated. herein, we discuss the fitness costs that arise from increased replication fidelity of HIV-1. RTs that have a higher fidelity of replication come at a cost to the virus. error-prone activity of RT is the most pertinent source of sequence variation to this review. but there are a number of other potential sources of HIV-1 mutations. RT of HIV performs two enzymatic activities: polymerization of DNA from template and degradation of the RNA template. the RT of HIV uses the genomic RNA (plus strand) and a cellular tRNA primer to synthesize the first strand of DNA. once the first strand of DNA is synthesized, almost all the genomic RNA will be degraded. the RT enzyme of HIV is a heterodimer of two subunits made from the same gene. the larger p66 subunit contains the two catalytic domains (polymerase and RNase H) and the smaller p51 subunit is believed to play a structural role. the upper left side pink domain depicts the \u201cfingers,\u201d the lower central pink domain is the \u201cpalm\u201d containing the active site. the gray domain is labeled the \u201cthumb\u201d. misincorporation, lacZ reporter 8.7-fold45 Cell-based assay: Misincorporation, lacZ reporter 5.7-fold45 Cell-based assay: Misincorporation, GFP reporter, measured by flow cytometry 1.96-fold35 Kinetics assay: Misinsertion of each possible incorrect nucleotide on a DNA template 24.4-fold45 E89G ddG, AZT, 3TC11,72 Reporter gene assay: Misin low fidelity of HIV RT is exploited during antiretroviral therapy by the use of NRTIs. these drugs mimic natural nucleosides, but usually lack the 5\u2032-OH group11 that is required for addition of the next nucleotide. drug resistance can emerge during treatment if taken intermittently or as mono- or dual-therapy. in vitro assays, pyrophosphorolysis was able to significantly influence the fidelity and selectivity of HIV-1 RT. pyrophosphorolysis was able to significantly influence the fidelity of HIV-1 RT. concentration required for 12 Vmax; higher ins indicates a lower fidelity24 Processivity The length of time the enzyme remains associated with the template/primer72 Fitness Capacity of the virus to replicate (produce infectious progeny)1. there are three broad categories of in vitro assays that have been used to quantitatively assess RT fidelity. the frequency of misinsertion is calculated as the ratio of the efficiency of insertion of the wrong nucleotide (W) compared to the right nucleotide (R) the efficiency of misinsertion is used as a measure of fidelity, where a high ins indicates a low fidelity. assays use purified RT where viral and host cell factors are absent. this is perhaps reflected by studies showing that the purified RT has a higher mutation rate than whole virus in vivo. despite this variation, these assays have an encouraging consensus. in vivo studies in both humans and chimeric SHIV-infected macaques showed that the M184V/I,34,37 K65R,35 and E89G38 mutants were less fit than wild-type viruses. the in vivo fitness costs of the M184I and M184V are particularly interesting, as the M184I mutation appeared early but transiently during 3TC treatment and was replaced by the M184V mutant. mutation rates of RNA viruses such as HIV sit near a critical \u201cerror threshold\u201d considered to be near a theoretical \u201cextinction threshold\u201d. the effect of lowering fidelity further is predicted to make the genome unstable, producing too many nonviable HIV genomes. mutagenesis study based on the Q151M NRTI-resistant mutation that has a small increase in fidelity. the Q151N version is drug resistant, but rarely arises in patients. a high-fidelity mutant may not have reduced fitness in hosts with depleted immune systems. a higher fidelity of replication may reduce the number of nonviable mutant viruses produced. a second potential mechanism underpinning the reduced fitness of higher fidelity RT mutants is a reduction in the rate of replication and/or processivity of the RT. the Q151N and M184V/I mutants had reduced growth in primary cells with low dNTP concentrations. a lower dNTP affinity is predicted to limit viral tropism in vivo. a lower dNTP affinity associated with higher fidelity may have a specific selective disadvantage, in addition to the general impact on the rate of replication. high-throughput sequencing has enormous potential and is the key to increasing our understanding of the cost of fidelity. high-throughput sequencing has enormous potential and promises a much greater exploration of the genomic population of higher fidelity mutants. studies of live-attenuated HIV vaccines in macaques have provided useful information on the types of immune responses necessary to prevent SIV infection. however, use of a live-attenuated HIV vaccine in humans seems unlikely to become a reality due to safety and efficacy concerns."}
