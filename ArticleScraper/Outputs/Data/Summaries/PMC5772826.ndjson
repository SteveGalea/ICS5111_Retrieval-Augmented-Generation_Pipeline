Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by maximum-likelihood analysis with tree topology evaluated using 1000 bootstrap replicates. overlapping the NS1 and VP1 genes encoded a predicted 214 aa protein that was 65 % identical to the non-capsid protein (NP1) of BPV1. proposed taxonomical changes to the family Parvoviridae suggest assignment of this divergent parvovirus as a new species in the genus Bocaparvovirus. ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1) is a ssDNA virus belonging to the genus Tetraparvovirus in the family Parvoviridae. two near-complete sequences of UTPV1 (5254 and 4994 bases) were determined from one Mexican and two USA sites. a total of 939 reads spanned 81.7 % of the genome that had 86 % nucleotide identity to the reference genome. nine complete or near-complete BCV sequences were assembled and were 99 % identical to the reference nucleotide sequence. the predicted spike proteins for all the BCV genomes determined in this study were also 99 % identical to the reference sequence. BPV3 is classified to species Ungulate erythoparvovirus 1. four near-complete viral genomes closely related to BPV3 were assembled from metagenomic sequencing reads. BPV3 was also identified in four asymptomatic animals. near-complete 4589 base sequence was assembled from 37 433 reads that shared 99 % nucleotide identity to the reference sequence. another 502 reads were obtained from a single asymptomatic Mexican animal which yielded 82.8 % coverage of the genome. % of the genome was assembled from a single sample and had 95 % nucleotide identity to a reference genome. the family Picobirnaviridae, consisting of a bi-segmented dsRNA genome, are genetically diverse and have been shown to infect a range of animals. none of the virus sequence read variables, modelled as dichotomous predictors, were significantly associated at the 5 % significance level (P0.05) with the probability of being a BRD case. however, having at least one sequence read for IDV (OR=2.94, OR 95 % CI=0.71\u201312.13; P=0.134), was significantly associated, at the 15 % level (P0.15), with the probability of an animal having clinical signs of acute BRD. 40 38.68\u201360.17 BAAV >15 3 5 0.56 0.12\u20132.55 37.50 12.31\u201371.95 0.448 0 44 41 \u2013 \u2013 51.76 41.07\u201362.30 BAdV3 >15 3 6 0.46 0.10\u20131.98 33.33 10.91\u201367.12 0.290 0 44 40 \u2013 \u2013 52.38 41.60\u201362.95 BRBV >15 11 10 1.10 0.41\u20132.95 52.38 31 0.984 0 43 46 \u2013 \u2013 48.31 38.00\u201358.77 BCV >15 14 9 1.74 0.66\u20134.62 60.87 39.94\u201378.44 0.259 0 33 37 \u2013 \u2013 47.14 35.65\u201358.95 BRSV >15 1 5 0.18 0.02\u20131.64 16.67 2.21\u201363.87 0.126 0 46 41 \u2013 \u2013 52.87 42.26\u201363.24 Total n 47 46 The number samples from all sites were analysed individually except for the 11 nasal swabs from diseased animals from the Mexican site. 93 samples (47 from diseased and 46 from asymptomatic steers) were considered for analysis. 77.4 million reads generated from which 40.5 million reads were derived from swabs of animals with acute respiratory disease.

Nearly all (99.7 %) viral reads were derived from diseased cattle (n=8) and IDV was also detected in nasal swabs from three asymptomatic animals. phylogenetic analysis of predicted capsid amino acids of (a) bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and (b) bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) BRBV was detected in all feedlot sites with the exception of one site in Mexico. the remaining five strains formed a well-supported clade with a maximum of 71 % identity to other BRBVs. a 850 base long region of the genome corresponding to the VP1 coding region failed to show significant similarity with EVE. phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. number at nodes represent percentage bootstrap support. a total of 3748 reads mapping to EVF were identified in samples from two Mexican and one USA feedlot sites. ungulate bocaparvovirus 6 (UBPV6) is a ssDNA virus belonging to the genus Tetraparvovirus in the family Parvoviridae. another 5060 base long contig (near-complete genome) was additionally assembled from a Mexican bovine nasal swab that shared 98 % nucleotide identity with UBPV6. two near-complete sequences of UTPV1 were determined from samples from one Mexican and two USA sites. both sequences shared 97 % identity to the reference sequence of BHoV2 at the nucleotide level and were 98 % identical to each other. ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 was previously identified in ground beef samples by metagenomic sequencing. BVDV1 was detected at three USA sites with 54 173 reads. a majority of reads (93.7 %) were derived from three sick animals. a total of 939 reads spanned 81.7 % of the genome that had 86 % nucleotide identity to the reference genome. four near-complete viral genomes closely related to BPV3 were assembled from metagenomic sequencing reads. BPV3 was also identified in four asymptomatic animals. predicted NS1 protein sequences had 99\u2013100 % amino acid identity to the reference species. a single asymptomatic Mexican animal yielded 82.8 % coverage of the genome. this sequence shared 97 % nucleotide identity to the BPIV3 genotype B reference sequence. the matrix protein from both sequences shared 100 % identity to the reference sequences at the amino acid level. a total of 623 reads were found in samples from seven sick and four asymptomatic animals originating from four Mexican and two USA sites. Picobirnavirus was detected in only one asymptomatic animal from a Mexican site. having at least one sequence read for IDV (OR=2.94, OR 95 % CI=0.71\u201312.13; P=0.134), or BRSV (OR=0.18, OR 95 % CI=0.02\u20131.64; P=0.126) was significantly associated, at the 15 % level (P0.15), with the probability of animals having BRD clinical signs. 0.848 0 36 36 \u2013 \u2013 50.00 38.49\u201361.51 IDV >15 8 3 2.94 0.71\u201312.1 72.73 40.95\u201391.11 0.134 0 39 43 \u2013 \u2013 47.56 36.88\u201358.47 EVE >15 5 2 2.62 0.47\u201314.6 71.43 32.12\u201392.96 0.265 0 42 44 \u2013 \u2013 48.84 38.33\u201359.45 EVF >15 2 total n 47 46 The number of sequence reads was categorized in two levels: >15 = at least one sequence read; 0=0 sequence reads (below detection limit of the assay) the number of sequence reads was categorized in two levels: >15 = at least one sequence read; 0=0 sequence reads. Detection rates of BHV1, BVDV, BRSV, BCV and IDV in symptomatic animals were similar to those determined by the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. despite sequencing 93 samples and sample pools, the relatively low specific virus detection rate in nasal swabs resulted in a small effective sample size, which prohibited achieving stronger statistical significance. a recent metagenomic survey of a large calf ranch found a significant correlation between detection of IDV, BRAV and BAdV3 and clinical disease. BRAV and BRBV are classified in the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae. five strains formed a well-supported clade with a maximum of 71 % identity to other BRBVs. BRBV strains mexB29, USII/19, USII/05, MexB10 and MexB39 represent a novel serotype of BRBV. VP2 and VP3 show genetic variability and segregate strains into genotypes/serotypes, it is likely MexKSU/5 represents a new serotype of EVE. it is unclear if this novel EVE played an aetiological role in clinical disease, illustrating our incomplete understanding of the role of EVE infecting cattle. a majority of the nasal swabs (n=82) tested positive for at least a single virus. a mean of 1.9 and 2.1 viruses were detected per swab from asymptomatic and sick animals. however, this difference was not significant. swabs were collected from the nasopharyngeal region using a polyester-tipped swab. they were placed in a tube containing 3 ml universal viral transport medium. all samples were collected by veterinarians as part of diagnostic surveillance activities. PRIselect protocol to isolate cDNA fragments greater than 250 bp. purified cDNA was quantified on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. nexteraXT library preparation (Illumina) protocol. ORFs were extracted from either reference-based or de novo-assembled contigs. assembled viral nucleotide sequences and ORF-translated peptides were searched against the non-redundant database with blastn and blastp algorithms. models were fitted using binary distribution, logit link, maximum-likelihood estimation and random intercepts for feedlots within states and of countries to account for the hierarchical structure of the study. outcome consisted of the probability of a animal showing clinical signs of acute BRD (as defined by the feedlot veterinarian) a sample of 103 feedlot steers, weighing approximately 227\u2013363 kg (500\u2013800 lb), was used. five samples were collected from diseased and five from asymptomatic steers. cattle exhibiting clinical signs of acute respiratory disease were considered as diseased. cDNA was purified using a known primer (FR26RV-N; GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN reads were mapped to the host reference genome (Bos taurus) and unmapped reads were collected and de novo assembled into contigs using default parameters. viral genomes with the lowest expectation values (E-values 10\u20135) were used as reference-based or de novo-assembled contigs. the best-fitted model of evolution was identified using the Bayesian Information Criterion in mega 6 (Tamura et al., 2013) maximum-likelihood trees were reconstructed using 1000 bootstrap iterations to evaluate the strength of branching. associations between the number of DNA sequence reads for different viruses and probability of an animal having clinical signs of BRD were analysed. categorized (as dichotomous predictors: 1: DNA sequence reads >1; and 0: DNA sequence reads=0). Odds ratios, model-adjusted means and 95 % confidence intervals were estimated for the association between each respiratory virus and the probability of BRD."}
