{"summary": "male and female NTac:SD rats were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and singly housed in static filter-top microisolation caging. male rats underwent surgical vasectomies at approximately 6 wk of age and were allowed to recover for more than 4 wk before being used in matings. animals were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Embryos for rederivation were harvested at the 2-cell stage from superovulated transgene-carrying or wild-type rats. phase of the estrous cycle2 is characterized by nucleated epithelial cells. the proestrus phase is indicated by nucleated epithelial cells, which often have angular edges. female rats in group 1 that lacked copulatory plugs on day 18 were randomly divided into 2 groups (groups 1a and 1b) after a rest period of 7 d, rats in group 1a received 40 g LHRHa on the morning of day 26; rats in group 1b received no injection. half-life of synthetic gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs, including LHRHa, is approximately 3 h. c:SD rats were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and singly housed in static filter-top microisolation caging. male rats underwent surgical vasectomies at approximately 6 wk of age. male rats were allowed to recover for more than 4 wk before being used in matings. all rats were acclimated for a minimum of 72 h before manipulation began. Embryos for rederivation were harvested at the 2-cell stage from superovulated transgene-carrying or wild-type rats after being mated with transgene-carrying stud male rats 36 h previously. the proestrus phase of the rat is indicated by nucleated epithelial cells. diestrus is characterized by an abundance of leukocytes, which often are mixed with cellular debris. female rats in group 1 that lacked copulatory plugs were randomly divided into 2 groups (groups 1a and 1b) after a rest period of 7 d, rats in group 1a received 40 g LHRHa on the morning of day 26; rats in group 1b received no injection. the half-life of synthetic gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs, including LHRHa, is approximately 3 h. vaginal cytologies from 14 Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (age, 5 wk) were obtained daily for a total of 20 d, starting on day 1. female rats found to be in late proestrus, early estrus, or estrus according to vaginal cytology were paired 1:1 with vasectomized adult Sprague\u2013Dawley male rats for 20 to 24 h. female rats were paired 1:1 with vasectomized Sprague\u2013Dawley male rats for 20 to 24 h. only rats in late proestrus to estrus were paired 1:1 with vasectomized male rats for approximately 20 to 24 h. female rats in group 1 received LHRHa on day 14, 8 (57%) were in late proestrus, early estrus, or estrus at 96 h (day 18) after LHRHa administration, as determined by vaginal cytology. one female rat that was in estrus after LHRHa administration was removed from further experimentation. of the 18 remaining female rats that were not paired with vasectomized males, 13 (72.2%) were in early diestrus. the remaining 5 (27.8%) were in late diestrus or early proestrus at 96 h after LHRHa. a female rat was diagnosed with pyometra and septic peritonitis. cytologic evaluation determined the phase of the estrous cycle in rats. all female rats in estrus from both groups 1a and 1b had confirmed copulatory plugs. female rats in estrus from both groups 1a and 1b that were paired with vasectomized males for 20 to 24 h had confirmed copulatory plugs. one female rat that was in estrus after LHRHa administration was removed from further experimentation because of injuries and abrasions. 13 (72.2%) were in early diestrus and the remaining 5 (27.8%) were in late diestrus or early proestrus at 96 h after LHRHa. the differences between these studies may reflect the younger female rats that we used or differences in outbred stock genetics. the majority of our rats underwent estrous cycle assessment between 5 and 8 wk of age. the first estrus occurs after vaginal opening, which occurs at approximately 35 and 36 d of age. the female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats are considered to be functionally mature. the use of vaginal cytologic sampling obtained by swabbing appeared to have no direct influence on the estrus-inducing effects of LHRHa after day 26 in experiment 1. however, the use of vaginal cytologic sampling obtained by swabbing appeared to have no direct influence on the estrus-inducing effects of LHRHa after day 26. the use of GER models in research has increased exponentially. the ability to perform ET in rats to rederive, reanimate, or create mutant rat lines is of utmost importance. personnel learn the common cytologic characteristics of the estrous cycle. the extra time invested in these procedures (less than 1 h) is extremely beneficial."}
