{"summary": "clinical signs of disease include fever, depression, anorexia, swollen joints with lameness, dyspnea, and central nervous system signs. clinical signs of disease include fever, depression, anorexia, swollen joints with lameness, dyspnea, and central nervous system signs. experimental evidence indicates that H. parasuis may colonize the nasal cavity and trachea initially, resulting in loss of cilia and damage to the ciliated epithelium. damage to the mucosal epithelial cells may facilitate invasion (11, 12) after colonization, there is bacterial invasion resulting in bacteremia and systemic spread of H. parasuis. heterologous protection was demonstrated using the SW114 isolate as either a bacterin or live vaccine. arthritis occurred in some of the pigs vaccinated with the live SW114. suspension with an A600 of 0.42 was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pigs were inoculated intranasally with 1 ml (0.5 ml/nostril) of this suspension. pigs were euthanized monthly, and full diagnostic workups were conducted. pigs were euthanized and given a full diagnostic workup. pigs were derived from large white landrace females and boars that were F2s from Large White Landrace females. pigs were bred by fresh artificial insemination, gestated in individual pens, and farrowed in traditional farrowing crates. no antibiotics (feed, water, or injection) or vaccines were ever used in the 10-year period from facility derivation until the start of this study. pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period. any pig showing signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease, such as joint swelling and lameness, incoordination, tremors, severe depression, or reluctance to move was immediately euthanized. group 1 consisted of 4 pigs that were intramuscularly (i.m.) vaccinated with a bacterin made from H. para pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period. surviving pigs were euthanized 10 days after challenge. swabs were collected and cultured as described for experiment 1. H. parasuis 29755 is a serovar 5 isolate cultured from the lung of a pig with Gl\u00e4sser's disease. it has previously been shown to be virulent in colostrum-deprived pigs. pigs were cultured on agar at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. a culture suspension with an A600 of 0.42 was prepared in PBS. no growth was observed after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. pigs were derived from large white landrace females and boars that were F2s from Large White Landrace females and synthetic sire lines (PIC L24 and L26) pigs were bred by fresh artificial insemination, gestated in individual pens, and farrowed in individual pens. twenty-five pigs from 4 litters distributed into 5 groups of 5 pigs. each group contained 1 pig each from 3 of the litters. one group each was challenged intranasally with 1 of the 4 isolates of H. parasuis or sham inoculated with PBS. pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period. any pig showing signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease, such as joint swelling and lameness, incoordination, tremors, severe depression, or reluctance to move was immediately euthanized. surviving pigs were euthanized 10 days after challenge. swabs were collected and cultured as described for experiment 2. swabs were collected and cultured as described for experiment 1. pigs challenged with 1 of 4 isolates of H. parasuis to determine isolate pathogenicity and virulence in a naive pig model of infection. one died without premonitory signs on day 3 postinfection and the rest were euthanized due to signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease between 2 and 5 days postinfection. no pigs developed disease, nor was H. parasuis isolated from nasal swabs taken from these pigs. Table 1 summarizes the ages of pigs, when they were euthanized, and sites from which H. parasuis was cultured. the contact pig showed signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease and was euthanized. the contact pig became lame with a swollen hock and was euthanized. three weeks after primary challenge, the 10 surviving pigs were challenged intranasally with H. parasuis isolate 12939. H. parasuis was isolated from the nasal cavity and lungs of the pig originally inoculated with isolate 29755. pigs that developed lameness were treated with one injection of ceftiofur (Excede; Pfizer) and recovered uneventfully. the 4 nonvaccinated pigs in group 3 developed signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease. all 4 pigs were euthanized 2 days postchallenge, and H. parasuis was isolated from the nasal cavity, trachea, and at least 1 systemic site. no clinical signs were seen in any of the pigs in groups 1 and 2 that were vaccinated i.m. with the SW114 bacterin or intranasally a small but statistically significant reduction in viable SW114 and 12939 cells after exposure to non-HI CDCD serum but not HI CDCD serum. no additional reduction in viable bacteria was seen with either H. parasuis strain when prevaccination sera were used as the antibody source. log10 CFU of H. parasuis SW114 (B) and 12939 (C) after 1 h incubation with non-HI CDCD pig serum as a complement source. HI prevaccination (Pre-vax) or postvaccination (Post-vax) sera collected from pigs vaccinated with SW114 bacterin intramuscularly (bacterin) or live SW114 intranasally (Live IN) or not vaccinated ( 29755 were euthanized due to signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease between 3 and 4 days postinfection. 4 of the 5 pigs inoculated with isolate MN-H were euthanized due to signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease between 2 and 5 days postinfection. pigs challenged with strain SW114 showed no signs of disease. one week after the initial challenge, one sham-inoculated pig each was placed in with the survivors that had been challenged with isolate 29755 or MN-H. the contact pig showed signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease and was euthanized. the naive pig was isolated from the nasal cavity and the joint. one naive pig died without premonitory signs 2 days postchallenge. the other 2 naive pigs were euthanized between 1 and 3 days postchallenge due to signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease. isolate 12939 of H. parasuis was isolated from the nasal swabs of all pigs inoculated with live SW114 on days 7, 14 and 21 postinoculation. the 4 nonvaccinated pigs in group 3 developed signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease, including lethargy, swollen joints, and neurologic signs. sera from pigs in experiment 1 were not evaluated. sera from pigs in experiment 1 were not evaluated. sera from pigs in experiment 1 were not evaluated. sera from pigs in experiment 1 were not evaluated. sera collected from live-SW114-immunized pigs that were not treated with ceftiofur were able to completely kill 12939. the killing capacity of sera from pigs treated with ceftiofur was identical to that of sera from bacterin-immunized pigs. this difference in sensitivity was not seen with strain SW114. strain SW114 caused no observable disease in experiment 1. strain SW114 was isolated from arthritic joints. pigs recovered quickly and without complications after treatment with ceftiofur. strain SW114, along with all type strains for serovars 1 to 7, was virulent when given intraperitoneally to guinea pigs. only transient clinical signs and minimal evidence for infection were present at necropsy (9, 26, 27) this strain retains the ability to cause systemic disease under certain conditions that have yet to be fully identified. pigs exposed to an aerosol of nonpathogenic serotypes later resisted challenge with a virulent isolate. pigs exposed to an aerosol of nonpathogenic serotypes later resisted challenge with a virulent isolate, indicating that mucosal exposure to live bacteria may induce cross-protective immunity. we are currently carrying out further sequence and virulence comparisons of these strains and other H. parasuis isolates that may identify virulence factors and possible attenuation targets. to develop better vaccines for H. parasuis, factors that correlate with protection need to be identified. antibodies raised to a highly virulent strain, Nagasaki, did not appear to enhance serum sensitivity to the homologous strain or 2 heterologous strains (nasal and systemic isolates) the nature of the antibody response induced by the Nagasaki strain may be different and in part the reason for its high virulence potential. treatment with ceftiofur was not effective in clearing H. parasuis from the nasal cavity. the ELISA detects serum IgG specific for the OppA protein. only 3 of 4 pigs given bacterin developed an OppA-specific serum antibody response. the results obtained with the pigs used in the current study also support the concept that Gl\u00e4sser's disease can occur in the absence of coinfections with common pig viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus. the pigs used in the current study appeared to be exquisitely susceptible to challenge with H. parasuis."}
