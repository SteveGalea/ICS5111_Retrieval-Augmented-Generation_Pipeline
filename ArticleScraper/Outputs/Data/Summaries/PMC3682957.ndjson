{"summary": "the first instance of human HPAI H5N1 virus infection occurred in 1997. it re-emerged in 2003 and has triggered sporadic human infections in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and africa. the true mortality rate of H5N1 infected individuals is currently unknown. recombinant HA proteins carrying pauci-mannose and high-mannose glycans elicited higher titers of HA-specific IgG antibodies. recombinant HA proteins carrying complex-type glycans induced even higher neutralizing and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HI) antibody titers. recombinant HA proteins from sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, and CHO-rHA were cloned into a pFast-Bac vector to obtain recombinant baculoviruses. the coding sequence was optimized and cloned into a pISID expression vector containing intron splicing. amplification was performed as described in Lin et al. (2010). insect cell expressed HA attached with pauci-mannose N-glycans and (B) mammalian cell expressed HA attached with complex-type N-glycans were created by the crystal structure of HA (A/Vietnam/1194/04, PDB ID: 2IBX) and Glyprot. the high-to-low order of molecular weights following treatment with Endo H was CHO-rHA > CHO-rHA(+NA) > Mimic-rHA > Sf9-rHA. the results confirm that different N-linked glycans were added to HA glycoproteins via insect or mammalian cell expression. mimic-rHA primarily contained bi-antennary complex glycans without terminal sialic acid (Gal1-2Man3GlcNAc4+/Fuc; 58%), high-mannose (Man7-9GlcNAc2+/Fuc; 29.2%), hybrid (Man3GlcNAc3+/Fuc; 6%), and minor pauci-mannose glycans (Man3GlcNAc3+/F recombinant HA proteins were placed on SDS-PAGE gels and deglycosylated using PNGase F. a dextran ladder was created with HILIC-HPLC to provide glucose unit (GU) values for individual peaks recognized in glycan samples. antisera were collected 2 wk following the second inoculation. recombinant HA proteins elicited the highest anti-HA total IgG titers. a ratio is derived by comparing the antibody titers in the presence and absence of urea. high avidity antibodies will have a higher ratio than low avidity antibodies. the results indicate that Sf9-rHA had the highest avidity and CHO-rHA the lowest among these four groups investigated. gG2b, and IgG3, Sf9-rHA immunization elicited higher levels compared to Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) immunization. HA containing pauci-mannose type N-glycans induced higher levels of the IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 subtypes. the numbers elicited by Sf9-rHA were significantly higher than those for the other three immunization groups. larger foci were found in antibody-secreting B cells detected by Sf9-rHA compared to those detected by CHO-rHA in all four immunization groups. pre-treated DCs were co-incubated with splenocytes from mice immunized with Sf9-rHA for 2 d. antigen presentation was determined by measuring (C) IFN-- and (D) IL-2-secreting T cells. HA, and CHO-rHA(+NA) reacted with DCs pulsed with each of different constructs. results indicate a correlation between stronger T cell responses elicited by Sf9-rHA immunization and increases in antigen-presenting DCs. antibody titers against the homologous clade 1 virus were determined using influenza VLPs reacted with turkey red blood cells. cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against (C) Cclade 2.3.4 of A/Anhui/1/2005 and (D) clade 2.3.2 of A/Hubei/1/2010 were also determined using H5pp assays. results were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs with one-way ANOVAs with Tukey's tests. -rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) immunization groups were significantly higher than those obtained from the Sf9-rHA and Mimic-rHA groups. mice with HA expressed in CHO cells with or without NA treatment had 80100% protection 14 days following the live virus challenges. immunized mice with HA expressed in CHO cells with or without NA treatment had 80100% protection. structures of the pauci-mannose and complex-type N-glycans attached to the trimeric H5N1 influenza HA protein (A/Vietnam/1194/04) were created using the crystal structure of HA from A/Vietnam/1194/04 strain (PDB ID: 2IBX) and Glyprot [18] for insect cell expression, the soluble recombinant HA-expressing coding sequences were cloned into a we only detected low-level endotoxin in the purified recombinant HA proteins. cultured insect and mammalian cells were used for HA expression. the levels of DNA and endotoxin are relatively minor. recombinant HA proteins were treated with excessive bacterial NA, CHO-rHA(+NA) to remove terminal sialic acid with decreased molecular weights. the high-to-low order of molecular weights following treatment with Endo H was CHO-rHA > CHO-rHA(+NA) > Mimic-rHA > Sf9-rHA. mimic-rHA primarily contained bi-antennary complex glycans without terminal sialic acid (Gal1-2Man3GlcNAc4+/Fuc; 58%), hybrid (Man3GlcNAc3+/Fuc; 29.2%), and minor pauci-mannose glycans (Man3GlcNAc2+/Fuc; 3.9%) CHO-rHA mostly contained complex glycans with bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures terminated at galactose ends due to sialic acid-associated NA cleavage. the glycan patterns consisted of complex N-glycans with bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures terminated at galactose ends due to sialic acid-associated NA cleavage. HA-specific IgG titer and IgG-binding avidity Group were immunized at three-week intervals with two 20 g doses of Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA, or CHO-rHA(+NA) proteins. we only investigated the immune responses elicited by recombinant HA proteins coupled with PELC+CpG adjuvant. a ratio is derived by comparing the antibody titers in the presence and absence of urea. the results indicate that Sf9-rHA had the highest avidity and CHO-rHA the lowest among these four groups investigated. no significant differences were found for serum IgA levels. for IgG1, CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) immunizations resulted in higher titers compared to Sf9-rHA. ELISPOT assays were performed using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. results were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs with Tukey's tests. numbers elicited by Sf9-rHA were significantly higher than those for the other three immunization groups. Splenocytes were added to each well in 96-well plates (5105 cells/well) and stimulated with 1 g/ml pooled peptides (15-mer overlapping 8 amino acids) spanning the HA1 of H5HA. pre-treated DCs were co-incubated with splenocytes from mice immunized with Sf9-rHA for 2 d. CHO-rHA stimulation was slightly restored by removing the terminal sialic acids of HA. higher levels of IL-2-secreting T cells were also observed in DCs pulsed with Sf9-rHA compared to the other three groups. a correlation between stronger T cell responses elicited by Sf9-rHA immunization and increases in antigen-presenting DCs. HI antibody titers against the KAN-1 clade virus were determined using influenza VLPs reacted with turkey red blood cells. cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against (C) Cclade 2.3.4 of A/Anhui/1/2005 and (D) clade 2.3.2 of A/Hubei/1/2010 were also determined using H5pp assays. cross-clade neutralizing antibody titers were also determined against two heterologous clades: clade 2.3.4 for A/Anhui/1/2005 and clade 2.3.2 for A/Hubei/1/2010. Neutralizing IC50 titers from the CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) immunization groups were significantly higher than those obtained from the Sf9-rHA and Mimic-rHA groups. recombinant HA glycoproteins containing complex terminally sialylated and asialyated-galactose type N-glycans induced higher levels of HI and neutralizing antibodies. antibody titers are much higher with the mammalian cell produced HA proteins with complex type N-linked glycans. recombinant HA proteins carrying terminal mannose residues induce lower HI antibody titers than HA proteins that carry complex glycans. the higher the glycan content of tri- and tetra-antennary complex glycans, the greater was the neutralizing and HI titers and consequent protective effect. the increased HI and neutralizing antibody titers associated with CHO-rHA are not due to suppressing DC activation by CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA displayed lower IgG2a:IgG1 ratios compared to Sf9-rHA and Mimic-rHA (0.65 and 2.90 versus 8.00 and 7.30 respectively), suggesting that the Th2 skewing response was favored by recombinant HA proteins containing sialic acid-terminated or galactose-terminated complex type N-glycans. no evidence to confirm the correlation between increased I the binding intensity of CHO-rHA to 2-3-linked sialic acids decreased by almost 25 folds as compared to Sf9-rHA. recombinant HA protein antigenicity and immunogenicity may not be directly associated with the receptor binding activity of 2-3-linked sialic acids. enhanced protective immunity can be due to CHO-rHA protein degradation. terminal sialic acids of complex-type HA glycoproteins did not significantly affect neutralizing antibody titers against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus clades. increased DC binding has been reported following the removal of HIV-1 gp120 terminal sialic acid [37] primarily containing galactose-terminated, bi-antennary, and high-mannose type complex N-glycans yielded lower levels of protective immunity. this suggests that tri- or tetra-antennary complex-type N-glycans are required for inducing protective immunity against H5N1 virus infection. differences and similarities in mouse, ferret, and human immune response. fected with recombinant baculoviruses produced by the Bac-to-Bac expression system (all Invitrogen) Mimic cells were grown in SF900-II medium supplemented with 5% FBS and infected with recombinant baculoviruses. supernatants were collected for HA purification using nickel-chelated affinity chromatography (Tosoh) the gel was frozen at 20\u00b0C for 2 h and then sliced in 1 mm2 pieces. the pieces were discarded and replaced with 11 acetonitrile: 20 mM NaHCO3. glycans were isolated from protein backbones using 10 kDa MWCO filters. intramuscular injections were given during weeks 0 and 3 and blood collected in week 5. spleens were collected and splenocytes isolated 1 d after second bleedings. antibody isotypes and subclasses were detected with ELISAs. 1 ml supplemented RPMI-1640 medium (10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, HEPES) on day 3, 1 ml of medium containing 15 ng/ml GM-CSF was added. half the cell-free supernatant was exchanged by fresh medium containing 10 ng/ml GM-CSF. freshly prepared splenocytes were added to each well (5105 cells/well) and stimulated with 1 g/ml pooled peptides spanning the HA1 of H5HA (A/Viet Nam/1203/2004) plates were incubated for 2 d at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. HI titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution completely inhibiting hemagglutination. HEK293A cells were co-transfected with pNL-Luc-E R pcDNA3.1(+) expressing the HAs of A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004. mice were challenged with a lethal dose (10MLD50) of reassortant HA vaccine. mice were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose (10MLD50) of reassortant H5N1 influenza virus (NIBRG-14) at 3 wk following the second immunization. slides were blocked with 50 mM ethanolamine in borate buffer (pH 9.2) slides were washed twice with water and PBS buffer. rabbit anti-H5N1 HA antibodies were added to each slide, followed by another 1 h of incubation in a humidified chamber. sequences in the three cell lines included the HA ectodomain of the A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (H5N1) strain followed by a GCN4pII termerization motif and a His tag as described in Lin et al. (2011). brio cholerae (100 mU/mg rHA) was purified using nickel-chelated affinity chromatography. recombinant HA proteins were placed on SDS-PAGE gels. the corresponding band was cut out of the gel. mouse immunization Female mice were immunized with 20 g of recombinant HA proteins mixed with 10% PELC and 10 g CpG. intramuscular injections were given during weeks 0 and 3 and blood collected in week 5. spleens were collected and splenocytes isolated 1 d after second bleedings. cells were spun down and re-suspended in 5 ml ACK lysis buffer. dead cell mass in supernatant was removed; splenocytes (>80% CD3+ cells) were re-suspended and used for all experiments. anti-mouse IFN- and IL-4 antibodies were used to coat multiscreen 96-well filtration plates that were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in RPMI. freshly prepared splenocytes were added to each well (5105 cells/well) and stimulated with 1 g/ml pooled peptides (15-mer overlapped by 8 amino acids) HI assay Sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken) for 18 h at 37\u00b0C followed by an additional treatment at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution completely inhibiting hemagglutination. culture medium was removed 2 d post-infection and cells were lysed using Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) Neutralization titers represent the serum dilution required to obtain a 50% reduction in RLU compared to control wells with the virus alone. slides were spotted with each 50 M glycan solution and designed to hold 14 grids. slides were allowed to react in 80% humidity for 1 h followed by overnight desiccation and storage in a desiccator at room temperature until use. antigen presentation was determined by measuring (A) IFN-- and (B) IL-2-secreting T cells using ELISPOT assays.
