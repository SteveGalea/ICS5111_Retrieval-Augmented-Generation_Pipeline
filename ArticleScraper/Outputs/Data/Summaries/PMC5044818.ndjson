{"summary": "the paramyxoviridae family is divided into two subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae subfamilies. the paramyxovirinae are further subdivided into a number of genera. the viral glycoproteins protrude from the outer surface of the envelope. paramyxoviruses counteract the IFN responses by producing proteins that block IFN induction and/or IFN signaling by a variety of mechanisms (3\u20137) paramyxoviruses counteract the IFN responses by producing proteins that block IFN induction and/or IFN signaling by a variety of mechanisms (3\u20137) IFN- can also induce an antiviral state in cells. it is inevitable that viruses will infect cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. several ISGs with direct antiviral activity have been shown to be specific for families or groups. murine IFIT1 (IFIT1B) inhibits translation of mRNAs that lack cap 1. it has been proposed that human IFIT1 recognizes some other, as-yet-undefined structure near the cap or possibly that 5\u2032 mRNA sequences may help define the specificity of inhibition by human IFIT1. culture flasks in modified Eagle's medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C. cells were lysed in disruption buffer, sonicated, and heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. the gels were fixed, stained, and dried, and resolved bands were visualized by phosphorimager analysis. cells to be stained for immunofluorescence were grown on 10-mm-diameter coverslips. monolayers were fixed with 5% formaldehyde\u20132% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) nuclei were removed by centrifugation twice at 4,200 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected, made up to 6 mM EDTA. the pellet was resuspended in RNase-free water and adjusted to 1 g/l. e and 5\u2032-phosphatase (RNGTT), RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) and cap methyltransferase 1 (CMTR1) were synthesized and purified according to the method of Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (42) the enzymes were verified as being active by in vitro reactions followed by thin-layer chromatography. the fusion protein His-SUMO-(TEV)-IFIT1 was expressed in a strain of Rosetta. it was cleaved with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C. cells were lysed in disruption buffer, sonicated, and heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. monolayers were fixed with 5% formaldehyde\u20132% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at 20\u00b0C, permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40\u201310% sucrose in PBS for 5 min at 20\u00b0C, and washed three times in PBS containing 1% calf serum. RNA selection and in vitro translations were isolated by sedimentation through CsCl gradients. nuclei were removed by centrifugation twice at 4,200 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected, made up to 6 mM EDTA. the supernatant was layered onto 35% (wt/wt) CsCl in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)\u20132 mM EDTA. guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT), cap methyltransferase 1 (CMTR1) were synthesized and purified according to the method of Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (42) the enzymes were all verified as being active by in vitro reactions followed by thin-layer chromatography. the fusion protein His-SUMO-(TEV)-IFIT1 was expressed in a strain of Rosetta. the fusion protein was cleaved with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. paramyxoviruses encode IFN antagonists that inhibit IFN production. we used naive A549, A549/Npro, and A549/shIFIT1 cells. naive A549 cells can produce and respond to IFN in response to virus infection. naive A549 cells can produce and respond to IFN in response to virus infection. naive A549 cells can produce and respond to IFN in response to virus infection. infected monolayers of cells in 6-well dishes were fixed at 4 days (PIV3) or 5 days (PIV5) p.i., and virus plaques were visualized by immunostaining the monolayers with antibodies to the respective NP and/or P proteins. the numbers at the bottom right give the average plaque sizes in millimeters with their standard deviation. all three viruses induced IFN in A549 cells as the plaques developed. PIV3 produced similarly sized plaques on A549 and A549/shIFIT1 cells and slightly larger plaques on A549/Npro cells. of PIV3 showed it to be more sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN. but this was not because JS is sensitive to IFIT1. we compared the synthesis of viral proteins in cells infected with PIV2, PIV3, and PIV5 that had, or had not, been pretreated with IFN prior to infection with PIV2. in 25-cm2 flasks were, or were not, treated with IFN 8 h prior to infection at a high MOI with PIV2, PIV3 (Washington strain) at 18 h p.i., cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. total-cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis through a 4 to 12% PAG. labeled proteins were visualized using a phospho muV is sensitive to IFIT1 but it forms pinpoint plaques on A549/Npro cells only at 5 days p.i. this suggests there are host cell restrictions other than innate intracellular defense mechanisms on MuV replication in A549 cells. strain of PIV5 was used in these experiments because, due to mutations in its V protein, it does not block IFN signaling (45). the expression of the NP protein of PIV3 was resistant to IFN in both A549 and A549/shIFIT1 cells when they were coinfected with PIV3 alone and when coinfected with PIV5. however, its expression was inhibited in A549 cells, even when the cells were coinfected with PIV3 total cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis through a 4 to 12% PAG. cells grown on coverslips were fixed and immunostained with antibodies specific for the NP and/or P proteins of the respective viruses. sensitivity of rubulaviruses is at least partly due to the actions of purified IFIT1. purified IFIT1 directly inhibits in vitro translation of mRNA. RNA isolated from mock- or PIV5-infected cells was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine for 90 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified IFIT1. polypeptides were separated by electrophoresis through a 4 to 12% PAG. purified IFIT1 was added to the in vitro translation reaction mixtures. there was no increase in the inhibition observed by increasing the amount of IFIT1 added to the in vitro translation reaction mixtures. this suggests that the translations of mRNAs are resistant to inhibition by IFIT1. purified human RNA guanylyltransferase, RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase, and cap methyltransferase 1 were used in these assays. RNMT adds a 5\u2032 guanosine to RNAs with 5\u2032-ppp, while RNMT adds a methyl group to the 7G of the guanine ring, generating (m7G) cap 0. a methyl group to the 2\u2032 OH group of the adjacent ribose, generating cap 1, by CMTR1 did not affect the efficiency by which the mRNA was translated. but it did clearly reduce the sensitivity of the mRNA to inhibition by IFIT1. in these experiments, we were unable to completely restore full translation of the luciferase mRNA in the presence of IFIT1. mRNA isolated from either muV (Enders)- or PIV5 (W3)-infected cells was translated prior to (lanes 1 and 2) or following (lanes 3 and 4) modification by CMTR1 in the presence or absence of purified IFIT1. the mRNA was translated in the absence (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or presence (lanes 2, 4 and 6) of purified IFIT1 compared to those made in the absence of IFIT1. paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. despite the fact that paramyxoviruses encode IFN antagonists that inhibit IFN production and signaling, their ability to block the IFN response is not absolute. they form larger plaques on IFN-incompetent cells than IFN-competent cells. a549 cells grown on coverslips in 24-well microtiter plates were infected with PIV2, PIV3 or PIV5 at an MOI. at 3 days p.i., the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to the NP proteins of the respective viruses (green) and anti-MxA antibody. at 18 h p.i., cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. labeled proteins were visualized using a phosphorimager. values indicate fraction of NP made in cells pretreated with IFN to NP made in untreated cells. IFIT1 is the primary ISG effector to PIV5 (23) and the rubulavirus PIV2 is also sensitive to IFIT1. however, knocking down IFIT1 did not have such a marked effect on PIV2 plaque size as it did for PIV5. this indicates there are likely to be additional ISGs that play an important role in IFN-mediated inhibition of PIV2. IFIT1 inhibits PIV5 (W3) and PIV2 (Colindale) protein synthesis but not that of PIV3 (Washington) cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks were, or were not, treated with IFN 8 h prior to infection at a high MOI. the relative levels of NP synthesis were visualized by radioactively labeling the cells for 1 h with [35S]methionine at 18 h p.i. these experiments clearly demonstrated that pretreating A549 cells with IFN inhibited MuV strain Enders protein synthesis but knocking down IFIT1 expression could restore MuV protein synthesis. muV-Lo was as sensitive as MuV Enders, demonstrating that attenuation was not linked to differences in their relative sensitivity to IFIT1. replication of nonrubulaviruses PIV3, SeV, and CDV is not inhibited by IFIT1. PIV3 does not inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1. the inhibition of PIV5 NP expression is regulated by cis-acting elements. sensitivity of rubulaviruses is at least in part due to the actions of IFIT1. in vitro translation of mRNA isolated from mock- and PIV5-infected cells was carried out. expression of the NP protein (and to a lesser extent the M protein) of PIV5 was clearly visualized in the background of in vitro-translated cellular proteins. purified IFIT1 selectively inhibited the translation of the NP and M proteins of PIV5 in a concentration-dependent manner. the values at the bottom of the gel indicate the fraction of either the host cell proteins or NP proteins made in the in vitro translation mixes in the presence of purified IFIT1 compared to those made in the absence of IFIT1. the sensitivity of in vitro translation of PIV5 mRNA to inhibition by purified IFIT1 correlated with the biological sensitivity of PIV5 to IFIT1. in vitro translation of luciferase mRNA using a 5\u2032-triphosphate group. mRNA was effectively translated in a cap-independent manner. lack of 2\u2032-O methylation of the cap structure of muV and PIV5 mRNAs is partially responsible for their sensitivity to inhibition by IFIT1. the luciferase mRNA was capped with the addition of 5\u2032-guanosine by RNGTT (generating Gppp-mRNA), there was a slight decrease in the amount of luciferase made. this may have been due to RNGTT destabilizing or blocking the translation of Gppp-mRNAs in the absence of 7N methylation. however, strikingly, translation of this mRNA was completely inhibited by IFIT1. sized by T7 polymerase (provided as a control in the Promega in vitro translation kit) was translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence or presence of purified IFIT1 (lanes 1 and 2). RNMT was used to methylate the cap at the N7 position (lanes 5 and 6), generating cap 0, and CMTR1 was used to methylate the adjacent ribose on the 2\u2032 OH position NGTT and RNMT did not increase the efficiency of in vitro translation of muV NP mRNA or its sensitivity to inhibition by IFIT1. however, addition of a methyl group to the 2\u2032OH group of the adjacent ribose (cap 1) by CMTR1 clearly reduced the sensitivity of the NP mRNA to inhibition by IFIT1. different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. the other paramyxoviruses that we tested were resistant, strongly suggesting that this might be a distinguishing feature of rubulaviruses to IFIT1. however, the sensitivity of more species of paramyxoviruses to IFIT1 needs to be tested. only rubulaviruses are sensitive to the antiviral activity of human IFIT1. the inhibition of rubulavirus mRNAs was produced by IFIT1 in a cis-linked manner. the restriction is associated with some feature of the mRNA sequence or structure. nucleoside to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA significantly increased the sensitivity of the mRNA to inhibition by IFIT1. methylation of the guanine ring at position N7 (m7GpppNp-RNA) by RNMT did not appear to affect the sensitivity of inhibition by IFIT1. this is consistent with the observation that human IFIT1 binds with low affinity to 5\u2032-ppp RNA but more avidly to cap 0 RNA methylation of the terminal ribose by CMTR1 of muV mRNAs partially alleviated inhibition of the NP mRNA by IFIT1. previous studies suggested that PIV5 mRNAs were 2\u2032 O-methylated (23), suggesting that at least a proportion of the PIV5 NP mRNA was correctly capped. alphaviruses can prevent IFIT1 binding to RNA independent of cap methylation status (50) most viruses successfully avoid inhibition by encoding their own 2\u2032-O MTase, by cap snatching appropriately capped and 2\u2032-O methylated structures from cellular mRNAs, or by having cap-independent translation with the covalently linked viral protein VPg. if viral mRNA is produced in cells in an IFN-induced antiviral state, then viral protein synthesis will be inhibited by IFIT1. however, enough of the virus IFN antagonist, the V protein, will be produced or brought in by infecting virus particles to target STAT1 for proteasome-mediated degradation. the cells will no longer be able to maintain their antiviral state."}
