{"summary": "the gut mucosal epithelium acts as a barrier between the luminal contents and underlying tissue. this barrier is maintained by cell-cell contacts formed by tight junctions. TJs are highly specialized intercellular adhesion complexes that contribute to the paracellular barrier (2\u20134) rotavirus disrupts TJs and uses the TJ protein JAM-A as a coreceptor. the amino-terminal domain of JAM-A also serves as a receptor for prototype and field isolate strains of mammalian reovirus (11, 12). rotavirus interacts with the N-terminal third of extracellular loop 1 in claudin-1. the cowden strain of porcine sapovirus replicates in a porcine kidney cell line in the presence of porcine intestinal contents or bile acids. this is the only strain in the genus Sapovirus that replicates in a porcine kidney cell line in the presence of porcine intestinal contents or bile acids. this strain is an attractive model for the study of Sapovirus and Norovirus life cycles. PSaV was observed to directly bind to occludin and then to become internalized as a complex into cells. these complexes were found to travel from early to late endosomes. RESULTS PSaV-induced early dissociation of TJs disrupts their functions. TER was determined in confluent LLC-PK monolayers grown on transwell inserts treated with medium only (mock-treated group) or with 200 M GCDCA bile acid. TER was measured in the apical-to-basolateral direction of the confluent LLC-PK cells grown on transwell inserts. the data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean. the distribution of the membrane fluorescent marker Bodify FL-C12-sphingomyelin\u2013BSA (5 nmol/ml) loaded onto the apical surfaces of the LLC-PK cells and detection of the basolateral marker Na+K+-ATPase were determined by z-sectioning on a confocal microscope. we analyzed the distribution of a lipid (Bodify FL-C12-sphingomyelin\u2013bovine serum albumin [BSA] in LLC-PK monolayers grown on transwell filters. the lipid was confined in the apical domains of control cells and that no lateral staining was detected. cells without any treatment showed clear basolateral distribution of Na+K+-ATPase. however, inoculation of LLC-PK with purified PSaV particles or VLPs resulted in translocation of Na+K+-ATPase to the apical surface. this results further confirm that PSaV infection disrupts the TJs of cells. LLC-PK monolayers infected or not with PSaV (MOI = 50) in the presence or absence of 200 M GCDCA bile acid were incubated for 30 min or 60 min; fixed; and stained for occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1. the cells were observed by x-sectioning or z-sectioning under a confocal microscope. LLC-PK cells were infected with AF594-labeled PSaV particles. occludins were also internalized into the cytoplasm. no prominent interaction between PSaV particles and other major TJ transmembrane proteins were visible. lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PSaV capsid protein. the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the relevant antibody. each complex was pulled down with MagneGST beads and then evaluated by Western blotting using antibody specific for PSaV capsid protein or occludin. the input occludin was also quantified by Western blotting. cells treated with occludin- or claudin-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were significantly decreased compared to those of mock-treated (without antibody treatment), PSaV-inoculated cells. however, pre- or posttreatment with MAb against claudin-1 had no significant effect on PSaV replication. PSaV uses claudin as an entry factor. cells were transfected with pooled small interfering RNAs. expression of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 was reduced at 48 h posttransfection. gene and two mutant plasmids (GFP-M1-OCC and GFP-M2-OCC) containing four silent-mutation sites corresponding to the four pooled siRNAs. cells harboring GFP-WT-OCC were sensitive to transfection with the pooled siRNAs targeting occludin. siRNAs against occludin and claudin-1 block PSaV entry. cells in 8-well chamber slides were infected with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled PSaV strain Cowden (400 particles per cell) 48 h after transfection with scrambled, occludin (siOCC), claudin-1 (siCLD-1), JAM-1 (siJAM-1), or ZO-1 (siZO-1) siRNA. all experiments were performed in triplicate, and representative results are shown. LLC-PK cells grown at 70 to 80% confluence on 8-well chamber slides were transfected with GFP-WT-OCC or GFP-M1-OCC and GFP-M2-OCC mutant plasmids. at 4 hpt, individually with each plasmid, the cells were then transfected with 4 individual pooled siRNAs against occludin. occludin knockdown effects were examined by confocal micros siRNAs against occludin and claudin-1 led to downregulation of target proteins. occludin and claudin-1 blocked PSaV infection. claudin-1 may serve as an entry factor. lysates harvested at the indicated time points were analyzed by Western blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. the MFC was calculated using GelQuant.NET software. titers were determined by the Reed-Muench method and expressed as TCID50 per milliliter. inhibitory effect of each siRNA on the PSaV titer was compared with that of scrambled-siRNA-transfected, PSaV-infected cells. CHO cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 did not allow virus replication. however, PSaV replication was evident in pmRFP-OCC-transfected CHO cells at 24 h p.i. but was markedly decreased by 48 h p.i. compared with LLC-PK cells infected with PSaV, VPg expression and genome copy numbers were very low. CHO cells grown in 6-well plates at 70 to 80% confluence were transfected with 1 g pmRFP1-OCC. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI = 50) and incubated for the indicated times. Rab5 is a key regulator controlling the internalization of vesicles and fusion with early endosomes. early endosomes contain Rab5 and its effector, EEA1. late endosomes contain Rab7 and its effector, LAMP2 (54) LLC-PK cells at 70 to 80% confluence were infected with Alexa 594-labeled PSaV (MOI = 50) 48 h after transfection with scrambled siRNA or siRNAs against Rab5. the knockdown effects on Rab5 protein by scrambled siRNA or siRNAs against Rab5 was evaluated by Western blot analysis. LLC-PK cells at 70 to 80% confluence were infected with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled PSaV (MOI = 50) 48 h after transfection with scrambled siRNA or siRNA against Rab7 and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the knockdown effects on Rab7 protein were evaluated by Western blot analysis. colocalization of AF594-labeled PSaV particles and occludin was analyzed at 30 min p.i. in the Rab5 knockdown cells or at 60 min p.i. in the Rab7 knockdown cells. transfection of scrambled siRNA had no inhibitory effects on the movement of colocalized PSaV-occludin complexes into the perinuclear area of the cytoplasm. occludin travel as complexes via early to late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. some enteric viruses, such as rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), can hijack TJs and their proteins for efficient entry and infection (4, 7, 8, 10, 17, 45, 46) the data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean. the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. LLC-PK monolayers treated without any chemical showed minimal diffusion of these tracers across the monolayers, confirming intact TJs. incubation of PSaV together with 200 M GCDCA increased diffusion by 24- and 14-fold for 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran. Binding of PSaV VLPs showed a pattern similar to that of PSaV particles. this led to 20-fold and 10-fold increases in the diffusion of 4-kDa FITC-dextran and 70-kDa FITC-dextran respectively. this results confirm that PSaV infection disrupts the TJs of cells. occludin, claudin-1, and JAM-1 relocalize from the cell surface to the cytoplasm (5, 17, 18) occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-1, and their submembranous scaffolding protein, ZO-1, in control monolayers. this result was confirmed by localization of occludin during PSaV infection. the internalization of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 was determined by counting cells containing each TJ protein in the cytoplasm. the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. the cells were fixed and stained for occludin and occludin. membrane proteins, such as claudin-1, JAM-1, or the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein ZO-1, were visible by CM. lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for OCC, JAM-1, or CLD-1. lysates of PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PSaV capsid protein. as a mock control, mock-infected cell lysates were directly analyzed using the relevant antibody. cells were either mock infected or infected with the PSaV strain Cowden. cells were immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, ZO-1, or PSaV capsid protein. pre- or posttreatment with MAb against claudin-1 had no significant effect on PSaV replication. occludin functions as a coreceptor for PSaV. occludin is required by PSaV at a postattachment step. expression of occludin, claudin-1, JAM-1, and ZO-1 was significantly reduced at 48 h posttransfection (hpt) compared to protein expression at 24 hpt. occludin expression significantly inhibited the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into the cells. transfection with scrambled siRNA (siScram) allowed the entry of AF594-labeled PSaV particles into LLC-PK cells at 70 to 80% confluence were transfected with 100 pmol of scrambled siRNA or 4 individual pooled siRNAs against OCC, CLD-1, JAM-1, or ZO-1. cells were harvested 24 or 48 hpt, and Western blot analyses were performed to determine the downregulation of each target gene. entry of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled PSaV particles began with a shift in the temperature to 37\u00b0C and incubation for 30 min. the cells were mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent containing 1 DAPI solution for staining of nuclei. slides were analyzed immediately by x-sectioning under a confocal microscope. occludin siRNAs were examined by confocal microscopy (B) and Western blot analyses (C) using antibody specific for occludin. occludin knockdown cells were inoculated with PSaV particles. occludin knockdown was observed from 6 h p.i. until 36 h p.i. LLC-PK cells at 70 to 80% confluence grown in 6-well plates were infected with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI = 50) 48 h after transfection with 100 pmol siScram, siOCC, siCLD-1, siJAM-1, or siZO-1. the inhibitory effect of each siRNA on PSaV genome replication was compared with that of scrambled-siRNA-transfected, PSaV-infected cells LLC-PK cells grown in 6-well plates at 70 to 80% confluence were transfected with combined siRNAs against occludin and claudin-1 or scrambled siRNA. at 48 hpt, cells were harvested and knockdown of target proteins was assessed by Western blot analysis. occludin expression confers PSaV susceptibility on nonpermissive cells. CHO cells transfected with pmRFP-OCC expressed occludin. CHO cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 did not allow virus replication. CHO cells grown in 8-well chamber slides were transfected with pCDNA3.1 or pmRFP1-occludin. expression of occludin was checked by confocal microscopy using antibody specific for occludin. cells were then infected with PSaV (MOI = 50) and incubated for the indicated times. LLC-PK monolayers grown in 6-well plates were inoculated with PSaV strain Cowden (MOI = 50) and incubated for 24 h. CHO cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected and incubated with pCDNA3.1 or pmRPF1-OCC plasmid for 24 h. PSaV strain Cowden is known to travel from early to late endosomes prior to PSaV uncoating and genome release into the cytoplasm. most AF594-labeled PSaV particles colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA1 at 30 min p.i. and with the late endosome marker LAMP2 at 60 min p.i. LLC-PK cells were transfected with either wild-type EGFP-Rab5 or a dominant-negative mutant (S34N) plasmid. they were stained for occludin (white) at 30 min postinoculation. the cells were mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent containing 1 DAPI solution for staining of nuclei. LLC-PK cells transfected with either wild-type-form EGFP-Rab7 or a dominant-negative mutant were stained for occludin at 60 min postinoculation. the cells were mounted with SlowFade Gold antifade reagent containing 1 DAPI solution for staining of nuclei. PSaV-occludin complexes were transfected with wild-type enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Rab5 (EGFP-Rab5WT) or EGFP-Rab7 (EGFP-Rab7WT) plasmids or plasmids containing dominant-negative mutants of EGFP-Rab5 (EGFP-Rab5S34N) or EGFP-Rab7 (EG members of at least nine different virus families have been reported to use TJ proteins as receptors (4, 45) cell surface proteins are also used as receptors by some caliciviruses as attachment factors. last two viruses recognizing a TJ protein, JAM-1, as a receptor (40\u201342, 44, 60) in the present study, we hypothesized that early infection of PSaV induced decreased TER in conjunction with increased paracellular permeability. alterations in the TJ fence function in response to PSaV infection were observed. the rotavirus surface protein VP8* modulates the gate and fence functions of TJs in epithelial cells. transfection of siRNA targeting claudin-1 blocked PSaV entry. claudin-1 was found to serve as scaffolds at the site of virus entry. similar findings have been observed in studies of the entry processes of some viruses. bile acids are critical for PSaV genome escape from late endosomes into the cell cytoplasm to start viral replication (55) bile acids have previously been reported to modulate intestinal permeability by autophosphorylation of the epithelial growth factor receptor. bile acids can facilitate early interactions between PSaV and occludin through the dissociation of TJs. inhibition of Rab5 or Rab7 by transfection of siRNAs diminished coentry of PSaV and occludin into the cytoplasm. the direct interaction between PSaV and occludin suggested that these complexes travel from early to late endosomes. this result was similar to those of previous studies. Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells purchased from Gibco were cultured at 27\u00b0C in SF-900 II SFM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 0.1% pluronic acid solution.
