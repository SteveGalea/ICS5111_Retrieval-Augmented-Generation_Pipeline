{"summary": "members of the genus phlebovirus are present worldwide and gain increasing attention as vector-borne agents of disease. there are long-known members, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Punta Toro virus (PTV), Toscana virus (TOSV) and sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) that are often reemerging or spreading into new geographical areas. phleboviruses are present across the entire Mediterranean basin, in Portugal, in the Middle East inclusive of the Arabian peninsula, in Sudan, in Ethiopia, and in Somalia. sandfly fever viruses are recognized as a significant public health threat, predominantly for immunologically naive groups such as soldiers or travelers. the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the kinases TBK1/IB kinase (IKK) eventually activate the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (27) the latter becomes phosphorylated, dimerizes, and accumulates in the nucleus, where it transactivates the IFN- promoter to kick off a first wave of IFN secretion. SFSV NSs expressed by recombinant RVFV were previously shown to inhibit the upregulation of the IFNB gene (44, 45) infection with parental SFSV strain Sabin resulted in only limited upregulation of IFN- mRNA. RNA was isolated 12 hpi for RT-qPCR analysis for NSs-containing RNA (C), IFNB (D), the L segment of SFSV (E) and the S segment of RVFV MP12 (n = 3; means SD) (F). n.a., not applicable. the NSs-specific siRNA pool with infection by either SFSV or RVFV MP-12, followed by RT-qPCR analysis. in infected cells the siRNA pool as well as the PCR primers can target not only the NSs mRNA but also the entire S genome segment. however, due to encapsidation of the genome, we expect a certain level of protection, which in turn would result in an underestimation of siRNA effects on NSs the impairment of SFSV replication by the NSs-specific siRNA was far less pronounced in IFN-incompetent cells. the siRNA knockdown of SFSV NSs resulted in simultaneous upregulation of IFN induction and downregulation of SFSV replication in IFN-competent cells. this validates the identification of SFSV NSs as an IFN induction antagonist. the NSs proteins of RVFV, TOSV, SFSV, PTV-A and PTV-B suppress IFN induction. we infected A549 cells with recombinant RVFV encoding the respective NSs genes. we monitored the intracellular levels of the known phleboviral targets TFIIH-p62, PKR, and RIG-I, as well as of the central RIG-I signaling factors MAVS, selected NSs proteins on phlebovirus host targets and central RIG-I signaling components. A549 cells were infected with SFSV or RVFV MP12 at an MOI of 1. SFSV NSs inhibits the IRF branch of IFN induction. phlebovirus NSs showed only a partial effect in response to large plasmid amounts. hek293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for MAVS; NSs of RVFV, SFSV, PTV-A or PTV-B; or inactive control Mx (0.1 ng, 1 ng, or 10 ng) SFSV NSs interacts with IRF3 in a highly specific manner. cDNA was inserted into recombinant RVFV to replace the RVFV NSs gene (rRVFVNS::NSsSFSV-CTAP) 293T cells were infected with this recombinant virus, tandem affinity purification was performed. SFSV NSs clearly coprecipitated with eGFP-IRF3 but not with eGFP alone. neither of the other phleboviral NSs proteins interacted with eGFP-IRF3. similar results were also observed in an inverse setting. eGFP-IRF2, eGFP-IRF5 and eGFP-IRF9 did not interact with SFSV NSs. eGFP-IRF3 and eGFP were included as positive and negative controls. eGFP-IRF3 and eGFP were included as positive and negative controls. SFSV NSs were acting downstream of IRF3 phosphorylation. IRF3 dimerization and virus-triggered accumulation in the nucleus were not impaired. SFSV was not preventing phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear localization of IRF3. SFSV NSs also interacted with IRF3 mutants that are deficient in dimerization. hek293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for NSs of RVFV, SFSV, PTV-A, or PTV-B or inactive control Mx, as well as firefly and Renilla luciferase reporters. 3FLAG-tagged SFSV NSs or PTV-A NSs were coexpressed with IRF3(5D) in HEK293 cells. cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against FLAG that was covalently coupled to magnetic beads beforehand. immunoprecipitation was performed via the use of GFP. RF3 phosphorylation induces a marked conformational change in the IAD. as a first step, we cut GFP-tagged IRF3 into two halves at position 190. only the N-terminal part, ranging from aa 1 to 190, was able to pull down NSs. however, fine mapping by further C-terminal deletions was inconclusive. a series of successively truncated eGFP-IRF3 mutants were produced from DNA templates by coupled in vitro transcription-translation. eGFP-IRF3 and MAVS were coexpressed in HEK293 cells either on their own or together with increasing doses of 3FLAG-tagged SFSV NSs. the presence of eGFP-IRF3 did not affect IRF3 activation, confirming our observations of SFSV-in eGFP-IRF3 binding was confirmed by the addition of an excess of nonbiotinylated IFN- promoter oligonucleotide. coexpression of SFSV NSs reduced the amount of promoter-bound eGFP-IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner. however, a scrambled control protein Mx had no influence. SFSV NSs expressed by recombinant RVFV were previously shown to inhibit the upregulation of the IFNB gene. infection with parental SFSV strain Sabin resulted in only limited upregulation of IFN- mRNA. RT-qPCR analysis for NSs-containing RNA (C), IFNB (D), the L segment of SFSV (E) and the S segment of RVFV MP12 (n = 3; means SD) (F). n.a., not applicable. a substantial depletion of NSs sequence-containing RNA species was observed. in the presence of the NSs-specific siRNAs, SFSV infection upregulated the amounts of IFN- transcripts. in the presence of the NSs-specific siRNAs, SFSV infection upregulated the amounts of IFN- transcripts. SFSV NSs acts in a nondegradative manner. many pathogenic phleboviruses counteract the IFN response by diminishing the levels of key host factors (3). NSs of RVFV induces proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins. infected cells monitored intracellular levels of phleboviral targets. levels of TFIIH-p62, PKR, and RIG-I were reduced only by RVFV NSs. PKR levels were reduced upon expression of the NSs of RVFV or PTV-A. cells were harvested 8 hpi for immunoblot analysis. SFSV NSs inhibits the IRF branch of IFN induction. for further investigations, we focused on the NSs of SFSV. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for MAVS; NSs of RVFV, SFSV, PTV-A or PTV-B; or inactive control Mx (0.1 ng, 1 ng, or 10 ng), as well as stimulation-dependent firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) and constitutively active Renilla luciferase reporters. the positive controls were set to 100% prior to calculating means and SFSV NSs interacts with IRF3 in a highly specific manner. cDNA was inserted into recombinant RVFV to replace the RVFV NSs gene (rRVFVNS::NSSFSV-CTAP) 293T cells were infected with this recombinant virus, tandem affinity purification was performed. selected 3FLAG-tagged NSs proteins were coexpressed with eGFP-IRF3 in HEK293 cells. eGFP and Mx served as negative controls for eGFP-IRF3 and the NSs proteins respectively. SFSV NSs selectively targets the immediate early-acting IFN transcription factor IRF3. 3FLAG-tagged SFSV NSs plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells. eGFP-IRF3 and eGFP were included as positive and negative controls. eGFP-IRF3 and eGFP were included as positive and negative controls. SFSV NSs were able to inhibit both IFN induction and PRD I activation by IRF3(5D). SFSV NSs also interacted with IRF3 mutants that are deficient in dimerization. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for NSs of RVFV, SFSV, PTV-A, or PTV-B or inactive control Mx. a dual-luciferase assay was performed in parallel with a PRDI-responsive firefly luciferase reporter (n = 3; means SD). eGFP-IRF3 or eGFP, as well as 3FLAG-tagged SFSV NSs, was obtained by transfection of HEK293 cells. SFSV NSs inhibit a molecular step that takes place after the nuclear importation of activated IRF3 but prior to IRF3-driven transcription. we cut GFP-tagged IRF3 into two halves at position 190. only the N-terminal part, ranging from aa 1 to 190, was able to pull down NSs. in this way, we found that the N-terminal DBD alone (aa 1 to 113) was sufficient for binding SFSV NSs. fine mapping by further C-terminal deletions was inconclusive. SFSV NSs prevents IRF3 from binding to the IFN promoter. eGFP-IRF3 and MAVS were coexpressed in HEK293 cells. the presence of SFSV NSs did not affect IRF3 activation. coexpression of SFSV NSs reduced the amount of promoter-bound eGFP-IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner, but the control protein Mx had no influence. we conclude that SFSV NSs impairs the binding of IRF3 to the IFN- promoter by covering essential amino acid residues within the DBD. induction of IFN- in SFSV-infected cells is inhibited by NSs. SFSV does not destroy key antiviral host factors that other dipteran-borne phleboviruses attack. NSs bind to the DBD of IRF3, thus prohibiting IFN- promoter activation. domain mapping consistently revealed that the N-terminal DBD alone was sufficient for binding of SFSV NSs. a mechanism involving the sequestration of the DBD by SFSV NSs from the IFN- promoter was strongly implied, and its presence was confirmed by a promoter binding assay. only US1 (also ICP22) of herpes simplex virus 2 and NP1 of human bocavirus have been described to employ a similar mechanism (72, 73) unlike SFSV, both these viruses target the IRF3 DBD and disrupt promoter binding. the intermediately pathogenic TOSV acts by degrading RIG-I itself (39), but its NSs seems to be degraded along with its host target, cutting down its inhibitory efficiency (78) stoichiometric mechanism requires NSs to accumulate to levels sufficient for sequestering the cellular pool of IRF3. stoichiometric and IRF3-specific nature of the anti-IFN induction strategy makes SFSV NSs a modulator rather chimeric RVFVs express PTV-A NSs are highly virulent (50, 82, 83), suggesting that PTV may be an outlier with respect to humans but not other mammals. the molecular strategy employed by the NSs protein can correlate with the degree of virulence of the parental phlebovirus. other factors, such as cell tropism, RNA polymerase activity, species-specific host protein interactions, and escape from adaptive immunity, are ated RVFV strains MP12 and clone 13 were propagated in BHK-21 cells. rZH548NSs::NSsPTV-A, rZH548NS::PTV-B, and rZH548NS::NSsSFSV-CTAP were generated using a polymerase I (Pol I)/Pol II-based rescue system. p-125Luc, p-55C1BLuc, and p-55A2Luc (52) were donated by Takashi Fujita. pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega. pEGFP-C1-IRF3(1-190), pEGFP-C1-IRF3(385A/S386A-R211A/R213A) and pEGFP-C1-IRF3(S385A/S386A-R211A/R213A) were generated via gene synthesis and subcloning (BioCat and Eurofins Genomics) RNA was isolated using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) RNA was subjected to DNase I digestion and cDNA synthesis. transcript levels of host genes were detected with SYBR Premix Ex Taq.
