{"summary": "invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit. it would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. respiratory viruses are well-known for their high prevalence in patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who exhibit milder clinical presentations. however, only limited data exist regarding the prevalence of respiratory viruses among healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) patients. the institution used the Seeplex Respiratory Virus Detection assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) from 2008 to 2014, the anyplexTM II RV16 with Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension technology was used. the RV16 uses 16 primer sets for the simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses. patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, and tuberculosis destroyed lung were defined to have chronic lung disease [15\u201317] patients with and without virus detection were compared in terms of their baseline demographics, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. all statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software (version 22.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and graphs were created using Prism 5 software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) a two-tailed P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. this assay is based on the multiplex PCR method. it uses a dual priming oligonucleotide system. it detects influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, RSV types A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E, NL63 and OC43, and rhinovirus. patients with and without virus detection were compared in terms of baseline demographics, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. patients with and without virus detection showed no significant differences in terms of age, sex, and disease severity, which was presented as the APACHE II score. seasonality was more prominent with CAP, compared to HCAP and HAP. clinical outcomes, such as the length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and in-hospital mortality, did not differ between the two groups. Detection rate was highest in February and January. 0.002 Specimen for RT-PCR 0.001 Invasive method only 36 (52.2) 352 (78.9) Noninvasive method only 8 (11.6) 37 (8.3) Both 25 (36.2) 57 (12.8) Laboratory findings Low white blood cell count (4,000/L) 15 (21.7) 69 (15.5) 0.259 Low platelet count (200,000/L) 57 (82.6) 291 (65.2) 0.006 C-reactive protein (mg/dL) 15.3 (7 10 patients had the same results from invasive and noninvasive sampling. 8 patients had negative results from the additional invasive sampling. influenza A was the most common pathogen detected (n = 21), followed by influenza A (n = 18), parainfluenza 3 (n = 12), RSV B (n = 9), adenovirus (n = 7), influenza B (n = 3), and parainfluenza 1 (n = 2). common bacterial pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). Bacteria were most commonly detected when influenza A was confirmed (n = 11), followed by clinical impact of virus detection The detection of a viral pathogen led to changes in the management of the disease in 23 (33.3%) patients. twelve patients received antiviral therapy such as oseltamivir and ribavirin, and empirical antiviral therapy was continued or extended in 4 patients. patients with and without respiratory virus detection showed no significant differences in terms of age, sex, and disease severity. but patients with a community onset, history of recent (2 weeks) chemotherapy, and lower platelet count had higher rates of virus detection. seasonality was more prominent with CAP, compared to HCAP and HAP. 135 (30.3) 0.147 Diabetes mellitus 13 (18.8) 96 (21.5) 0.611 Hematologic malignancy 19 (27.5) 79 (17.7) 0.053 Use of immune suppressants 15 (21.7) 73 (16.7) 61 (13.7) 0.255 Chronic kidney disease 13 (18.8) 61 (13.7) 0.255 Chronic lung disease* 6 (8.7) 48 (10.8) 0.602 Recent chemotherapy 15 (21.7) 42 (9.4) 0.002 Specimen for RT- the detection rate was the highest when both invasive and noninvasive samplings were performed. 10 patients had the same results from invasive and noninvasive sampling. the detection rates showed similar distributions when they were divided into the 3 pneumonia categories, except for that of influenza A. CAP, community acquired pneumonia; HCAP, healthcare associated pneumonia; HAP, hospital acquired pneumonia Bacterial coinfection was detected in 27 (39.1%) patients. the most common bacterial pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), followed by Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2), and Pseudomonas clinical impact of virus detection The detection of a viral pathogen led to changes in the management of the disease in 23 (33.3%) patients. twelve patients received antiviral therapy such as oseltamivir and ribavirin. the length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and in-hospital mortality were compared according to changes in management. the overall virus detection rate was 13.3%, with RSV A the most common pathogen and influenza A virus the most common pathogen of bacterial coinfection. this study is the first to specify the clinical impact of severe viral pneumonia according to the detection of respiratory viruses. previous studies have been conducted in children or with milder forms of pneumonia. however, children have much higher rates of respiratory viral illnesses than adults and should be discussed separately. a detected respiratory virus was unlikely to be neutral and pathogenic in certain group of patients according to a previous report [33]. the risk of false-negativity cannot be perfectly ruled out. the detection rate was lower than that of previous reports [21, 22]. file.
