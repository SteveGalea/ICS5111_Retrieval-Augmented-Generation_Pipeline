{"summary": "investigations of syndromic events were identified by using the keyword \u201csyndrome\u201d in searches of PubMed and CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. the other investigations included the syndromic events of Kawasaki disease; Legionnaires\u2019 disease; Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome associated with receipt of swine influenza vaccine; Lyme disease; toxic shock syndrome; HIV/AIDS; toxic oil syndrome; Brainerd diarrhea syndrome; chronic fatigue syndrome; eosin precautions were issued in 1980 and 1982 regarding use of salicylates to treat chickenpox and influenza in children19; in 1982, the US Surgeon General made similar recommendation. subsequent investigations implicated risk factors, including salicylate use in setting of certain antecedent viral infections. increased risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was associated with receipt of the 1976 swine influenza vaccine. the specific etiology and pathogenesis of the swine influenza vaccine remain undetermined. pontiac fever (1968) and Legionnaires\u2019 disease, 197631\u201338 Legionella pneumophila, causing isolated cases and outbreaks of acute, febrile respiratory disease. the syndrome of Pontiac fever, characterized during a 1968 outbreak investigation, was attributed to L. pneumophila only after the investigation of the 1976 Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak. in 1998, FDA licensed the first vaccine for use for prevention of Lyme disease. however, the manufacturer pulled the vaccine from the market in early 2002. the first epidemic-associated cases (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 5 homosexual males) were reported in June 1981. confirmation of the epidemic was not reported until early 1982. the initial 1981 descriptive report suggested a role for lifestyle (sexual contact) risk factors but proposed no interventions. despite knowledge of this syndrome for more than a quarter-century, its etiology remains unknown. a key unanswered question is whether Brainerd diarrhea occurs only in outbreaks or also causes sporadic cases of chronic diarrhea. specific etiology remains undetermined. clinical features of this syndrome are similar to those seen in patients during the toxic oil syndrome epidemic of 1981. the precise etiological agent(s) and mechanism(s) remain unknown. the magnitude of this outbreak (> 1500 cases through May 1991) highlighted limitations in public health surveillance systems for detecting and monitoring such problems. isolation of previously unrecognized, novel SARS-CoV reported in late March 200377,78; spread by person-to-person transmission through respiratory secretions and droplet exposure. at least as early as March 21, 2003, CDC recommended the use of standard infection control measures, airborne and contact precautions, and eye protection for all patient contact. exposed workers experienced nerve conduction abnormalities involving very distal and proximal nerves. most patients improved following cessation of exposure, both with and without immunotherapy. cause and epidemiology were determined for more than half of the syndromic events reviewed in this article. the specific etiologies have remained undetermined for years, even decades, after their initial recognition. however, the type, scope, and focus of the investigations varied depending on the amount of information that was available. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving The One Health Initiative. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving The One Health Initiative. advances in formal, interdisciplinary cooperation have emerged or accelerated over the past decade. the historic model for public health response is to establish and sustain methods and programs that can rapidly identify potential public health anomalies. the investigation of the epidemics of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in 1976 and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993 clearly illustrates how changes in problem recognition can help to retrospectively diagnose previously unsolved problems. advances in microbiological, molecular, and other diagnostic technologies allow for substantially more rapid and specific identification of a broader spectrum of biological agents than imaginable even 2 decades ago. a case study of how investigative findings can have both an immediate and a long-term effect on public health preparedness policy and practice. etiology remains under investigation. etiology remains under investigation. etiology remains under investigation. etiology remains under investigation. a substantive, unanticipated outcome of an entirely different nature was the legal precedent that emerged following the investigation of the nationwide epidemic of menstrual TSS. complexity of societal and other factors affecting the pace of implementation of public health interventions is further illustrated in the investigation of Reye\u2019s syndrome and in the study of the neuropathy epidemic in Cuba during the early 1990s. the epidemic of optic and peripheral neuropathies in Cuba during 1991 through 1993 occurred within a context of economic deterioration and associated limited food availability. the overall experience with this epidemic documented the myriad challenges of detecting, investigating, and intervening in a syndromic problem. etiology, or both, are still under investigation. the unfolding of a biothreat event may not conform to, and likely will depart substantially from, the expected epidemiological patterns associated with deliberate actions causing a bioterrorist event. the anomalous epidemiological patterns associated with deliberate actions causing a bioterrorist event necessitate strengthening the means for detecting and responding to such events. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving The One Health Initiative. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving the one health initiative. the investigation of the epidemics of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in 1976 and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993 clearly illustrates how changes in problem recognition and advances in diagnostic technologies can help to retrospectively diagnose previously unsolved problems. hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993 was confirmed as the cause of several previously unsolved outbreaks, including some as early as 1957 and 196537,38. international epidemiological and laboratory investigations directed toward identifying an etiological agent92 showed how the response to some problems can advance key policy initiatives. in the united states, SARS also prompted federal, state, and local public health agencies to review their legal authorities for isolation and quarantine. this event elucidated the paramount role of case definitions during investigations93; underscored the importance of rapidly identifying causative infectious agents. in the case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its recognition in 1981, epidemiological investigations identified risk factors and established the basis for some key interventions approximately 2 years before the causative agent was identified. a substantive, unanticipated outcome of an entirely different nature was the legal precedent that emerged following the investigation of the nationwide epidemic of menstrual TSS. fda rule that aspirin-containing products were required to be labeled with a warning about Reye\u2019s syndrome. but not until 1986, after completion of a fifth case\u2013control study supporting the link between aspirin and Reye\u2019s syndrome, did the US Food and Drug Administration rule that aspirin-containing products were required to be labeled with a warning. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving The One Health Initiative. interdisciplinary engagement in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment is a key consideration driving the one health initiative. the historic model for public health response is to establish and sustain methods and programs that can rapidly identify potential public health anomalies, assess their effect on the population, and determine the causative agent to initiate steps to reduce, alter, or eliminate the risk for continued transmission. enhancing diagnostic and technological tools and expanding policy tools and partnerships warrant additional discussion because maximizing the use of these strategies may be critical in responding to events when information is insufficient for initiating control measures. transform public health policy and legal authorities at local, state, federal, and global levels. the experience with the then-newly emerging SARS-CoV in 2003 is a case study of the extent to which investigative findings can have both an immediate and a long-term effect. the need for scientifically defensible action grounded in experience may help investigators assess effectiveness of control measures. a substantive, unanticipated outcome of an entirely different nature was the legal precedent that emerged following the investigation of the nationwide epidemic of menstrual TSS. the complexity of societal and other factors affecting public health interventions is illustrated in the investigation of Reye\u2019s syndrome and in the study of the neuropathy epidemic in Cuba during the early 1990s. the experience with Reye\u2019s syndrome underscores that even though scientific evidence is of central importance, it is only one of several factors that influence decisions about implementing public health interventions. the epidemic of optic and peripheral neuropathies in Cuba during 1991 through 1993 occurred within a context of economic deterioration and associated limited food availability. the overall experience with this epidemic documented the myriad challenges of detecting, investigating, and intervening in a syndromic problem. events of the 21st century have underscored the need for expanding public health partnerships to include ongoing collaboration with other sectors and disciplines. since 2001, the CDC has established new or substantially strengthened existing relationships with previously nontraditional partners. public health agencies have prepared for, investigated, and responded to disease outbreaks for decades. some emerging or reemerging disease threats may arrive at US ports of entry from countries in the form of foods or other vehicles. the armamentarium of tools and methods available to address them is on the rise."}
