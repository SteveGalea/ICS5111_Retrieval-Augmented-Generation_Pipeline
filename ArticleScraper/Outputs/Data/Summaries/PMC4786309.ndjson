{"summary": "enriched angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggesting a role in its pathogenesis. results indicate important anti-inflammatory actions of Ang 1\u20137 in the pathogenesis of IBD. the proteolytic enzyme renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys to cleave the N-terminal region of angiotensinogen to form Ang I. Ang II binds to two main receptors; AT1R and AT2R. Ang 1\u20137 induces its biological effects through the only known receptor for this peptide. treatment with ACEIs or ARBs resulted in significant reduction in colitis severity. colitis severity can also be ameliorated by making mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the angiotensin gene [21] or ATR1a deficiency [22]. ritic model [27] was mediated through inhibition of NFB activity and reduction of cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-1, MCP-1 and CXCL1. Ang 1\u20137 has been found to reduce the severity of allergic inflammation in mice by suppressing the activity of ERK1/2 and NFB pathways. all experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee at Kuwait University Health Sciences Center. the general health and wellbeing of the mice was monitored for their eating/drinking habits, activity, or other severe signs of hunched or lateral recumbency or starry fur or lethargy. a freshly prepared dose of 1 mg/kg was administered to a second group of mice by daily intra-peritoneal (i.p) injections in a volume of 500 l per injection. a third group received DSS containing water and daily i.p injections of 0.9% saline (vehicle) tissue processing and embedding cassettes were rinsed in two changes of formalin. dehydrated in several changes of graded alcohol (70%, 90% and 100%) three changes of xylene were used for tissue condensation and clearing. sections were washed briefly with distilled water and stained in eosin solution for 7 min. the extent of ulceration was determined on each section along the muscularis mucosa and expressed as percentage ulcerated mucosa [38]. a blood smear was made on a glass slide by placing a drop of blood on one slide surface and using a second glass slide to push the blood forward from the edge of the drop, and left to dry for 24h. protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) samples containing 50 g protein were dissolved in an equal volume of 2 x Lammeli sample buffer and -mercaptoethanol, heated at 90\u00b0C for 10 min. proteins were transferred (at 100 V for 1 h) onto a PVDF membrane. sections were washed and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (Goat anti rabbit SFX kit; Life Technologies, USA, 1:400 dilution) for 2 h in the dark. images were captured on a ZIESS LSM 700 confocal microscope and fluorescence intensity estimated in defined fields using Image J software package. samples and blank (PBS) were pipetted into the wells and mixed with 5 l of the balance solution. wells were washed five times with 1 x wash solution prior to addition of HRP substrates A and B and 15 min later, of stop solution. control (untreated; UT) mice received autoclaved tap water only. the solution was replaced every 2 days for the duration of the experiment. decrease in body weight provides indirect indication of colitis severity. the fourth group received daily i.p injections with dexamethasone (DEX) at doses of 0.01\u20131.0 mg/kg or its vehicle (0.9% saline) the entire colon of each mouse was removed by a ventral midline incision and opened longitudinally. its length and maximal bowel thickness was measured (in mm) with calipers. stained sections were washed briefly with distilled water and stained in eosin solution for 7 min. a clearing step was performed by rinsing in three changes of xylene (2 min each) followed by mounting with DPX. the stained sections were (blindly) scored by 3 observers using a standard semi-quantitative histology scoring system. slides were dipped 5 times in a fixative to stabilize cellular components. then dipped 10 times in a buffered solution of eosin Y and 7 times in a buffered solution of thiazine dye. slides were rinsed in distilled water, dried and stored at room temperature. i.p injections with dexamethasone (DEX) at doses of 0.01\u20131.0 mg/kg or its vehicle (0.9% saline) (prophylactic approach) the entire colon of each mouse was removed by a ventral midline incision and opened longitudinally. its length and maximal bowel thickness was measured (in mm) with calipers. stained sections were washed briefly with distilled water and stained in alum haematoxylin solution for 7 min. a clearing step was performed by rinsing in three changes of xylene (2 min each) followed by mounting with DPX. scores for each feature were summed with a maximum possible score of 11. a total of 100 cells were randomly counted in each slide. a protease inhibitor cocktail was added separately. samples containing 50 g protein were dissolved in an equal volume of 2 x Lammeli sample buffer and -mercaptoethanol. Membranes were washed 3 times for 1 h with 1x TBS-T buffer and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibodies. sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated through a series of washes in graded ethanol and water. images were captured on a ZIESS LSM 700 confocal microscope. Ang 1\u20137 protein measurement in plasma and colon homogenates Colon tissue was homogenized as described above and sonicated for 1 min for further disruption of the cell membrane. Ang 1\u20137 levels were measured in plasma (A) and colon homogenates (B) at 3 and 7 days after treatment with 3.5% DSS (open bars), and compared to untreated (UT) mice (solid bars). effect of DSS treatment on colonic expression of Ang II, ACE2 and MAS-1 R Ang II expression determined by immunoblotting was increased at days 4 and 6 post-colitis induction. immunofluorescence staining of ACE2 and MAS-1 R in untreated mice (UT) and at days 4 and 6 post colitis induction. panel A shows % body weight changes in saline (hatched line, open squares) or Ang 1\u20137 treated mice (gray lines) after DSS administration compared to the i.p group. panel B shows % of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils determined at day 7 post colitis induction in saline (hatched bars) or Ang1-7 treated mice (open bars) compared to UT group (solid bars) panel C represents histological assessment of colitis severity and the % of ulceration in the whole colon section respectively in the groups indicated. Ang 1\u20137 at 0.1 mg/kg dose reduced ano-rectal bleeding, blood in stool and erythema by 15\u201340% but at 0.3\u20131.0 mg/kg, this protective effect was lost. a significant reduction in colitis severity was seen with Ang1-7 treatment only at the lower doses of 0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg. daily i.p injections of Ang 1\u20137 at 0.06 mg/kg dose significantly increased the plasma levels of Ang 1 % of mice showing each parameter Mice group Diarrhea Blood in stool Adhesion Erythema Edema Ano-rectal bleeding UT 0 0 0 0 0.9% Saline + DSS 94 55 100 83 100 61 Ang 1\u20137 (0.01 mg/kg) + DSS 33* 22* 89* 22* 67* 55* Ang 1\u20137 (0.06 mg/kg) + DSS 67* 22* 100 44* treatment with 0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg doses improved mucosal integrity. this anti-inflammatory effect of Ang 1\u20137 was lost with higher doses. mice were given daily i.p injections of Ang 1\u20137 (for 3 days) 4 days after DSS administration. panel B shows % of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils. panel C and thickness (panel D) was determined in saline (hatched bars) or Ang1-7 treated DSS mice (open bars) compared to UT group (solid bars) panel E and F represent quantitatively the histological assessment of colitis severity. numbers are means of 5\u201318 mice for each group (9 for UT, 18 for DSS/i.p saline and 5 for Ang 0.01 mg/kg and Ang 0.06 mg/kg) the effects of Ang 1\u20137 with the classic anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DEX) were assessed by macroscopic examination. panels B and C show colon length and thickness (in groups as indicated) panels D and E represent means SEM for 4 (DEX 0.01 mg/kg, DEX 0.06 mg/kg and DEX 0.1 mg/kg) or 5 (DSS/i.p saline, DEX 0.3 mg/kg and DEX 1.0 mg/kg) mice per group. the MAS-1 R antagonist A779 was administered (for 4 days) with daily i.p injections at 1 mg/kg dose. DSS/i.p saline group did not show weight reduction since DSS treatment was given for 4 days only. litis induction was determined in a779 (open bars) or saline treated mice compared to UT group (solid bars) panel C and thickness (panel D) was determined in saline treated mice compared to UT group (solid bars) levels of phosphorylated forms of three key signaling intermediates, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and Akt were measured by immunofluorescence in sections from resected colon tissue of untreated mice or mice treated with DSS for 7 days plus daily Ang 1\u20137 or saline (vehicle) treatment. in each case, expression was enhanced by DSS and reduced by Ang 1\u20137 back to the basal levels observed in the UT group.

Ang 1\u20137 at doses of 0.01 and 0.06 mg/kg reduced this drop in body weight by 5\u201310% compared with the DSS/saline i.p treated group. panel A shows % body weight changes in saline (hatched line, open squares) or Ang 1\u20137 treated mice (gray lines) after DSS administration compared to untreated (UT) mice receiving tap water only (hatched line, open circles) panel B shows % of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils determined at day 7 post colitis induction in saline (hatched bars) or Ang1-7 treated mice (open bars) compared to UT group (solid daily i.p injections of saline (vehicle) resulted in diarrhea, blood in stool, adhesion, erythema, edema and ano-rectal bleeding. presence of erythema was reduced by 40\u201360%, incidence of diarrhea by 30\u201360%, ano-rectal bleeding by 6\u201350%, blood in stool by 30%, and edema by 20\u201330% relative to the UT group. DSS treated animals with 0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg doses of Ang 1\u20137 improved mucosal integrity and reduced the degree of immune cell recruitment to the colon. this anti-inflammatory effect was lost with higher Ang 1\u20137 doses. panel A shows a colon section taken from mice treated with Ang 1\u20137 plus DSS. treatment with 0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg doses improved mucosal integrity. anti-inflammatory effect of Ang 1\u20137 was lost with higher doses. panel A shows % body weight change in mice injected daily (for 3 days) with saline (hatched line, open squares) or Ang 1\u20137 (gray lines) post-DSS administration compared to UT mice receiving tap water only throughout (hatched line, open circles) panel B shows % of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils. % of mice displaying each parameter Mice group Diarrhea Blood in stool Adhesion Erythema Edema Ano-rectal bleeding UT 0 0 0 0 0 0.9% Saline + DSS 0 0 100 80 100 0 0 Ang 1\u20137 (0.01 mg/kg) + DSS 0 0 100 0* 40* 0 Ang 1\u20137 (0.06 mg/kg) + DSS 0 0 100 dexamethasone treatment at 0.01 mg/kg dose significantly reduced diarrhea, blood in stool, ano-rectal bleeding and erythema. panel A shows % body weight change in saline (hatched line) or DEX treated mice given DSS administration for 7 days. panel A shows % body weight change in saline (hatched line) or DEX treated (gray line) mice given DSS administration for 7 days. new tab Colitis severity was assessed by macroscopic examination in UT mice. numbers are means of 4 (DEX 0.01 mg/kg, DEX 0.06 mg/kg and DEX 0.1 mg/kg) or 5 (DSS/i.p saline, DEX 0.3 mg/kg and DEX 1.0 mg/kg) mice per group. effect of inhibiting the action of endogenous Ang 1\u20137 levels on colitis severity. panel A shows % body weight change in untreated (UT; hatched line, solid circles) or DSS treated (for 4 days) mice given daily i.p injections of A779 (gray line, open squares) or saline (gray line, solid squares) panel B shows % of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils determined at day 4 post DSS colitis induction in A779 (open bars) or saline treated mice (hatched bars) colitis severity was assessed by macroscopic examination in UT mice. numbers are means of 5\u20139 mice for each group (9 for UT and 5 for DSS/i.p saline and DSS/A779) Fig 9. Immunofluorescent detection of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in colon sections. panel E represents quantitative assessment of fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units) Ang II levels similar to levels seen in i.p saline group. colon sections taken from untreated mice or mice treated with DSS for 7 days plus Ang 1\u20137. plasma levels of Ang 1\u20137 were significantly reduced at 7 days post DSS treatment. increased expression of the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MAS-1 R axis post DSS challenge might reflect a compensatory protective mechanism to reduce the effect of the inflammatory response. the anti-inflammatory effects of Ang 1\u20137 treatment were associated with a reduction in the phosphorylated forms of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt post DSS induction. this was consistent with previous reports showing reduced activity of these molecules post Ang 1\u20137 treatment in the anterior pituitary [31], proximal tubular cells [29] and lung tissues. ukocyte recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine release are consistent with a protective role of the ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS-1 R axis observed in this study. daily i.p injection of DEX at doses 0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg significantly reduced colitis severity at macroscopic (Table 3) and histological level."}
