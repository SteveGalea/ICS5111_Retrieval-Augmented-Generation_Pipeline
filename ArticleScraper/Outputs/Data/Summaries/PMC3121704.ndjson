{"summary": "HBoV is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with mild to severe lower respiratory tract infections in children. the aim of the work was determination of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR. ELISA revealed positive HBoV IgM antibodies in 18 (18%) patients who were also positive by PCR. human bocaviruses (HBoV) contain 3 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a nonstructural protein (NS1, NP1) and two capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 respectively. the genomic organization of HBoV closely resembles that of bovine parvovirus type 1. HBoV has been reported in respiratory samples from children with acute respiratory tract disease in various parts of the world. a standardized ELISA for the quantitative determination of HBoV-specific antibodies has been established by [16]. the aim of the work was determination of HBoV in respiratory specimens (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR and determination of acute HBoV infection. e 15/90 (16.6%) 33/90(36.6%) Normal flora 33 (33%) Total 100 (100%) Qualitative PCR results Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the patients were positive for HBoV. also there was a high significant difference between the patient and the control groups since p 0.001 (table 2).

Diagnostic validity test of PCR. weissbrich et al., [21] had found HBoV DNA in (100% vs 81.1%) of NPA samples obtained from 786 hospitalized infants and children with febrile respiratory tract diseases in the region of northern Bavaria in Germany. 12% of the NPA were positive for HBoV DNA by both techniques. acute primary HBoV infections in 49 (19%) of 258 children with expiratory wheezing. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and efficacy of ELISA were 81.8%,100%,100% and 97.7% respectively. ELISA was a reliable serologic analysis for diagnosis of acute HBoV infection by estimation IgM antibodies in serum. samples were collected from patients and control group according to ELISA. sterile normal saline solution was instilled in one nostril while occluding the other nostril. patient was instructed to forcibly exhale through the lavaged side into a sterile specimen cup. sequence was repeated in the other side of the nose. PCR reactions were carried out in a 50 l volume consisting of 5 l extracted DNA, 1 Qiagen HotStar buffer, dNTPs at a final concentration of 200 M each. the cycling conditions were 50 cycles (94\u00b0C 30 s, 53\u00b0C 40 s and 1 min at 72\u00b0C) bovine antigen was visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at 1:12,000 in PBST plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and H2O2 for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. cut off absorbance for negative and positive IgM ELISA results were 0.136 and 0.167. amplification of hBoV DNA was performed using 50 l elution volume with the NP-1 primers BoV188F and BoV542R described by Allander et al. PCR HBoV542R CTCTGTGTTGACTGAATACAG 354 Qualitative PCR After amplification, PCR products were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide on agarose gels. a plasmid containing the PCR product cloned in the vector PCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) was used as positive control. between PCR and ELISA for diagnosis of HBoV infection was evaluated using CHI square test. diagnostic validity test including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. author declares that she has no competing interests."}
