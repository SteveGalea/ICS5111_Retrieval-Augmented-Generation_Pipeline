{"summary": "ischemic stroke accounts for 70% in china and 80%-85% in western countries. physiopathologic conditions, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and prothrombotic state, have been found to increase the risk for ischemic stroke. renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in brain acts as a crucial regulator for physiological homeostasis and diseases of the cerebrovascular system. ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis counteracted harmful contributions of ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis on prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. we also discuss the underlying mechanisms referring to these beneficial effects in this article. Ang II levels have been found to be temporarily increased after ischemic stroke in rat brain [18] and contribute to neural damage through elevating oxidative stress levels, inducing inflammatory response and reducing cerebral perfusion in the ischemic hemisphere via AT1R [19]. ACE2 is widespread throughout the rodent brain, including neurons [21], astrocytes [22], and endothelial and smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries [23]. Ang-(1-7) can be cleaved into Ang-(1-5) or Ang-(1-4) by ACE [34] or neprilysin [35]. ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis is the new arm of the RAS in brain. ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis protects against ischemic damage. ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis acted as a pivotal regulator of blood pressure. this counteracted the pressor effect of ACE-Ang II-AT1R in brain. in 2008, Diz et al. injected the selective ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 into the NTS of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and observed a long-lasting reduction in mean arterial pressure. Xiao et al. found that overexpression of ACE2 in the brain reduced local Ang II level in a triple transgenic mouse model. Xiao et al. found that overexpression of ACE2 in the brain reduced local Ang II level in a triple transgenic mouse model while Feng et al. revealed that overexpression of ACE2 in the brain caused a reduction in AT1R expression [50]. a study from Sriramula et al. showed that ACE2 overexpression significantly decreased AT1R and ACE expression and increased AT2R and Mas expression in the PVN of male SD rat [43] the study also showed that I.C.V infusion of Ang-(1-7) for 4 weeks downregulated the expression of AT1R which was accompanied by a reduction in Ang II levels in SHR brain. infusion of Ang-(1-7) into lateral cerebral ventricle of DOCA rats was found to cause an improvement of baroreflex function. in addition, infusion of Ang-(1-7) into lateral cerebral ventricle of DOCA rats was found to cause an improvement of baroreflex function. nitric oxide (NO) in the CNS was found to act as a vasodilatory and sympatho-inhibitory molecule, and participate in central an in vitro study from Xia et al. found ACE2 overexpression was related to a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line treated with Ang II [61]. in vivo, they also found that PVN-targeted ACE2 over-expression significantly decreased Ang II-induced ROS formation via NADPH oxidase inhibition and attenuated the increase in the expression of tumour necrosis endothelial dysfunction and proliferation of VSMC are involved in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. rupture of atherosclerotic plaque usually triggers plaque thrombosis, blocking the cerebral arteries and leading to the ischemic stroke. Ang-(1-7) was found to inhibit Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation and migration, partially through negative modulating Ang II induced ERK1/2 activity. many studies revealed that AVE0991 as a non-peptide Mas agonist could ameliorate atherosclerosis progression [7]. nous infusion of Ang-(1-7) into rats caused 50% to 70% reduction of the thrombus weight. antithrombotic effects of captopril and losartan were attenuated by A-779 in a dose-dependent manner. ang-(1-7)-evoked release of NO and prostacyclin was partially mediated by Ang-(1-7)-evoked release of angiotensin receptor blockers. I.C.V infusion of Ang-(1-7) has been found to attenuate the ischemia-induced increase in MDA levels. it also enhanced total SOD activity in peri-infarct tissues of rat brain. inflammatory response also played a crucial role in pathophysiology of ischemia stroke. the role of NO in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke was double-sided and somewhat ambiguous. formation of nitric oxide by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in activated microglia was reported to be deleterious, which took part in the irreversible ischemic brain injury [85, 86]. ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic damage after ischemia insult, which counteracts the deleterious actions of ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis in brain. ang-(1-7) has a relatively short duration of biological effect, since it was rapidly inactivated by ACE in vivo. AVE 0991 is a non-peptide and an orally active Ang-(1\u20137) receptor Mas agonist that mimics the Ang-(1\u20137) effects in several organs such as kidney and heart. activation of ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis plays a protective role in CNS. anti-atherosclerotic and antithrombotic actions of ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis after ischemia insult. abbreviations: Ang-(1-7), Angiotensin-(1-7); AT2R, Angiotensin II type 2 receptor; BK, Bradykinin; eNOS, Endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kina iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; MDA, Malondialdehyde; NF-B, Nuclear actor-B.
