{"summary": "transforming growth factor beta (TGF-)/SMA- and MAD-related protein (SMAD) signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating numerous processes in the cell. the classic TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway consists of a ligand (TGF-1) and two transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, namely TGF- receptor I (TGFBR1) and TGF- receptor II (TGFBR2). lnc-small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lnc-SNHG1) directly binds to miR-302/372/373/520. lnc-small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lnc-SNHG1) directly binds to miR-302/372/373/520. lnc-small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lnc-SNHG1) promotes expression of target gene. miR-425 interacts with the classical TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway. we isolated and characterized the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the porcine TGFBR2 gene and further identified potential miRNAs that target TGFBR2 in GCs. dulbecco\u2019s minimum essential medium/nutrient F-12 (DMEM/F-12), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Opti-MEM were purchased from Gibco (USA) lipofectamine 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) the protease and phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Roche (Basel, Switzerland) the products were analyzed using electrophoresis with 1.5% agarose gel. purified by DNA gel Extraction kit (TsingKe, Beijing, China) Western Blotting Porcine GCs were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) containing 1% phosphatase inhibitor (v/v) the protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) total protein extracts were separated on using SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and electrophoresed for 1 h. after washing with tris buffered saline tween (TB pcDNATM3.1 (pcDNA3.1)-SMAD4 and pcDNA3.1-TGFBR2) were amplified and cloned into pGL-3 reporter vector (Promega) the mutant plasmids were generated by TreliefTM SoSoo Cloning Kit (TsingKe, Beijing, China) 10 L (4 g) of anti-SMAD4 antibody or rabbit IgG antibody were added into each sample and incubated by shaking at 4 \u00b0C overnight. reversal of crosslinking was done using 16 L NaCl (5M) at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. DNA was released and precipitated with chloroform-isoamylalcohol method. SMAD3 (Catalog #D155234-0100), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Catalog #D198662-0100), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit (Catalog #D110065-0100), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) were purchased from Sangon Biotech (S gene-specific oligonucleotide (GSP) AAGGGCGCTTTGCCGAGGTCTATAA was used to amplify the 3\u2032-end of the TGFBR2 gene from the 3\u2032 RACE library. purified TGFBR2 3\u2032-UTR fragment from 3\u2032 RACE assay was cloned into the pClone007 Blunt Vector. qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate with AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Takara, Beijing, China) using the ABI Step One system. the mRNA levels of TGFBR2 and DiGeorge syndrome Chromosomal Region 8 (DGCR8) were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and U6 small nuclear RNA (U6) was used as the internal control for miRNA apoptosis analysis 48 h after transfection, GCs were harvested. a cell-counting machine (Becton Dickinson, USA) was used for detection of apoptotic cells based on the principle of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 1 107 porcine GCs were collected and 1% formaldehyde was added to crosslink the protein and the chromatin. the sonicated protein-chromatin complex (800 L) was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 100 L of the supernatant were collected as input control. 400 L of the supernatant were diluted 2.5-fold and incubated with 100 L protein A/G-agarose. we isolated the 3\u2032-UTR of the porcine TGFBR2 gene by using a RACE assay and found only one clear band, approximately 3400 bp in length. the full length 3\u2032-UTR of the porcine TGFBR2 gene was 2381 bp, with 94.73% nucleotide identity with the pig genome sequence. the polyA signal (PAS) is located 28 nucleotides before the PAT sequence. miR-1306 targets the TGFBR2 3\u2032-UTR in GCs Porcine miR-1306 or ssc-miR-1306. pre-miR-1306 sequence was highly consistent with other vertebrates. mature as well as seed sequences were identical in vertebrates. qRT-PCR and Western blotting results showed the TGFBR2 protein levels after miR-1306 mimics or inhibitor were transfected into GCs. the data is represented by mean SEM. * indicates p 0.05; ** indicates p 0.01. p-SMAD3 levels were dramatically reduced in GCs when miR-1306 was overexpressed. p-SMAD3 levels in the GCs increased when miR-1306 was inhibited. findings suggest that miR-1306 suppresses TGFBR2 to modulate the TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway in GCs. KEGG assay showed that miR-1306 significantly improved the GC apoptosis rate. a decrease in miR-1306 levels reduced it (Figure 3B) this suggests that miR-1306 can promote apoptosis of porcine GCs. both miR-1306 mimics and TGFBR2-siRNA were co-transfected into porcine GCs to determine whether miR-1306 mediates GC apoptosis or not. our findings suggest that silencing of TGFBR2 could improve GC apoptosis caused by miR-1306. miR-1306 promoter transcriptional activity in GCs treated with pcDNATM3.1 (pcDNA3.1)-SMAD4 was determined by dual-Luciferase Activity Assay. each experiment has three independent repetitions and results are shown as mean SEM. ds directly to the miR-1306 promoter to Inhibit its Transcriptional Activity We also identified and characterized the core promoter of the porcine miR-1306 gene. we detected four SMAD4-binding elements (SBEs) indicating that SMAD4 may act as a transcription factor and regulate miR-1306 transcription. results showed that only the SBE2/3 motif within the miR-1306 promoter could specifically bind to SMAD4. pcDNA3.1-SMAD4 was co-transfected with recombinant vectors in (B) into GCs. luciferase activity assay was performed. each experiment was independently repeated thrice. results are presented as mean SEM. miR-1306 mediates SMAD4 feedback regulation of the classical TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway in GCs. results of Western blot analysis showing the TGFBR2 protein level after (A) SMAD4- small interfering RNAs (SMAD4-siRNA) was transfected into miR-1306-inhibited GCs. the polyA signal (PAS) (AAUAAA) is located 28 nucleotides before the PAT sequence. miRNA response elements (MREs) for 160 candidate miRNAs were identified on the 3\u2032-UTR of porcine TGFBR2 mRNA (Supplementary Figure S5) using an online program, RNAhybrid. microRNA-1306 (miR-1306) inhibits endogenous transforming growth factor- receptor II (TGFBR2) expression in porcine granulosa cells. miR-1306 mature sequences are indicated by black asterisks. qRT-PCR and Western blotting results showed that overexpression of miR-1306 significantly reduced the TGFBR2 mRNA (Figure 1C) and protein levels in GCs. the miR-1306 level was found to be negatively correlated with TGFBR2 mRNA level in the follicles of porcine ovaries. GFBR2 inhibited the miR-1306 inhibitor-mediated enhancement in p-SMAD3 level in GCs. this suggests that miR-1306 suppresses TGFBR2 to modulate the TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway in GCs. miR-1306 regulates GC apoptosis by inhibiting TGFBR2. both miR-1306 mimics and TGFBR2-siRNA were co-transfected into porcine GCs to determine whether miR-1306 mediates GC apoptosis or not. BR2 found that GC apoptosis was regulated by miR-1306 in pigs by targeting TGFBR2. SMAD4 suppresses miR-1306 expression by inhibiting its transcriptional activity independent of its host gene DGCR8. miR-1306 promoter transcriptional activity in GCs treated with pcDNATM3.1 (pcDNA3.1)-SMAD4 was determined by dual-Luciferase Activity Assay. each experiment has three independent repetitions and results are shown as mean SEM. luciferase activity of plasmids with wild-type SBE, SBE1-mut, and SBE4-mut were dramatically enhanced after SMAD4 overexpression. but that of the SBE2/3-mut construct remains the same. SMAD4 directly interacts with SBE2/3 motif and inhibits miR-1306 gene transcription in GCs. SMAD4 feedback Activates miR-1306 by Inhibiting miR-1306. miR-1306 expression may be mediated through SMAD4 feedback regulation. pcDNA3.1-SMAD4 mimics miR-1306 with SMAD4-siRNA. cDNA3.1-SMAD4 was transfected into miR-1306-overexpressed GCs. the axis is involved in SMAD4-mediated positive feedback regulation in classical TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway. expression of TGFBR2 is modulated by MREs and their miRNAs in various cell types. miR-145 in vascular smooth muscle cells [35], miR-9-5p in hepatic stellate cells [36], miR-9-5p in hepatic stellate cells [36], miR-520e, miR-9-5p, and miR-135b in cancer cells [38,39,40]. miR-1306 targets the TGFBR2 mRNAs are ubiquitous in the genome of eukaryotes and occur within intragenic regions such as introns and exons. most intronic miRNAs are seen to co-express and are functionally consistent with their host genes. miR-1306 is suppressed by the transcription factor SMAD4 in porcine GCs. miR-1306 is regulated by SMAD4 but also targets TGFBR2, a key receptor upstream of SMAD4. this suggests that miR-1306 mediates SMAD4-positive feedback regulation of the classical TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway. a few reports have revealed the mechanism of this feedback regulation. pro-apoptotic factor miR-1306 controls porcine GC apoptosis by targeting TGFBR2 and inactivating the TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway. findings pave the way for a potential non-hormonal target or drug therapy candidate for improving female fertility."}
