{"summary": "the viral gene segments encode four or five polypeptides. the large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the medium (M) segment encodes a precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into Gn and Gc glycoproteins. the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein. pathogenic hantaviruses and their principal reservoir hosts will be required to validate laboratory findings. rodentia is the largest mammalian order and is comprised of about about a third of the population. only a few dozen species have been identified as susceptible hosts. most hantaviruses are hosted by a single rodent species. hantavirus infection results in no conspicuous pathology and persistent infection. two new world hantaviruses cause HCPS-like disease in golden hamsters. ANDV causes most HCPS cases in south America. no human cases of disease have been associated with MAPV. work by Hutchinson et al. showed that vertical transmission occurred among cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) infected with black Creek Canal virus. it is possible that both routes may influence transmission at the population level. patterns of expression of genes related to the immune response are different in infected males and females. some deer mice have significantly greater amounts of viral RNA. this suggests certain individuals may have a prominent role in population-level transmission of hantaviruses. some serological assays are IgG-specific, others use antiserum to whole IgG. deer mice, PUUV-specific antibodies can be detected in serum as early as 10 days post infection. rats experimentally infected with SEOV also produce IgG within two weeks post inoculation. the presence of IgG in these naturally and experimentally infected reservoirs is an indicator of class switching and affinity maturation. the ITAM interferes with the antiviral response of an infected cell. it may also alter the RIG-I pathway that leads to IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent Ifn expression. putative nonstructural NSs sequences have been identified in some hantaviruses. this sequence is in an alternative reading frame of the nucleocapsid transcript. in other bunyaviruses, NSs has anti-interferon activity [68,69,70] a Treg response may prevent sterilizing immunity, thus allow virus to remain in a population. the response transitions to a regulatory response that may allow episodic recrudescence of virus that can be shed. mixed Th1/Th2/Treg response were present in virus-specific CD4+ T cells. expression of immune response genes differed in the spleen. some deer mice produced nucleocapsid-specific IgG by day 10. others had IgG around day 20 or later, and neutralizing antibody was not detected until after 3 weeks. endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD-L1. despite this, endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD-L1. antigen presenting cells isolated from Norway rats were resistant to stimulation. this suggests that virus infection inhibits normal signaling activities of these cells. hantaviruses are complex processes that are challenging to study, even with substantial reagent resources and mature methodologies. pathogenic hantaviruses require BSL-3 and/or ABSL-4 containment, which presents logistical hurdles for examining reservoir host/hantavirus relationship. many genes are modulated (expressed or repressed) during the course of infection. identification of mRNA and noncoding RNAs can be used to identify the mechanisms that control, or fail to control disease. some infectious diseases, including hantavirus disease, have substantial immunopathologic components. RSEM estimates transcript abundances, including isoforms, in experimental samples. it does not require an annotated genome; it determines the abundance of transcripts from the unannotated assembly, identifies differentially expressed transcripts, and provides a 95% credibility interval for each gene. q can identify global miRNA expression and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs. the field of metabolomics is young but potentially informative for understanding hantavirus/reservoir host interactions. many viruses metabolically remodel the host cell to optimize infection. many available antibodies to house mouse (Mus musculus) or Norway rat antiviral proteins will be cross-reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species. the use of cytokines or neutralizing cytokine antibodies to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance. anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5) and anti-rat CD8 (clone 341) antibodies can be used to deplete CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from hamsters. it is difficult to assess CTL activity in reservoir hosts. most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic. the quantitative assessment of the transcriptional landscape can be used to profile the host responses in infected and uninfected animals of the same species. the depth of coverage and costs of RNA-Seq have improved dramatically in the last few years, and it is likely to become less expensive. bioinformatics tools for RNA-Seq are now widely available. microRNAs (miRNA) have been identified that are important regulators of antiviral responses. miRNA expression has been evaluated in hantavirus-infected human endothelial cells, epithelial cells and macrophages. no work has been conducted to examine the role of miRNAs in reservoir host cells infected with hantaviruses. many viruses remodel the host cell to optimize infection. this approach may help identify which enzymes may be targeted by hantaviruses. the use of monoclonal antibodies has been particularly challenging for hantavirus/reservoir research. the use of cytokines or neutralizing cytokine antibodies to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance. this approach revealed a critical role for CD4+ T cells for sustaining CTL responses to LCMV. e 341) antibodies can be used to deplete CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from hamsters. most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic. generation of highly inbred strains is challenging and may result in alleles that do not represent the natural biology of hantavirus infection. it should be possible to accelerate research to understand the relationships of hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts."}
