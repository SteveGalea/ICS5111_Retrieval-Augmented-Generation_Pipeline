{"summary": "an edge connecting the two nodes can represent biochemical interactions, as well as biological and/or hierarchical associations between the nodes. the proposed representation allows visualization of the network in multiple ways in order to (i) highlight a set of glycoproteins as promising receptor candidates. the relevance quantification process was achieved in two steps. we first associated each edge with a relevance depending on the type of its connecting nodes (i.e., protein-glycan) according to the proposed weights as a function of the lectin binding intensity measured via glycan array screenings. cluster view revealed cluster-like visualizations (49), thus allowing us to explore groups of nodes belonging to the same local cluster. some glow and shading effects can be applied in order to distinguish between the groups of nodes according to their types within the same cluster. cluster representation shown is focused on the human glycoproteins (green nodes), tissues (pink nodes), systems (orange nodes) and diseases (red nodes) associated with glycan determinants. tissue clusters are represented with a pink glow (A), the protein clusters are shown with a green glow (B), and the disease clusters are shown with a red glow (B). the most relevant elements of the four main network clusters are shown in detail as closeup views of panel B (four lower subpanels) in panel B, the disease and protein nodes are most important, since the node (and font) sizes are proportional to the lectin binding intensities, and they are the most connected ones hierarchical view from the lectin-like adhesins toward the human body system. the human proteins and the related abbreviations are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. determinants gal(1-4)GlcNAc (A) and Fuc(1-2)Gal (B) are both characterized by a high number of connections, and the glycan-binding strength. no label is shown; the Epa/Als intensities of binding to the glycans that contains these determinants are lower than the other determinants. results of network analysis both exhibited known associations and predicted novel ones. a circular view of the same LGI network focuses on the glycan determinants that are bound by FimH-LD, the potential glycoprotein ligands. only a few of the predicted glycoprotein binding receptors are associated with specific disease states. in cluster 1 are proteins such as UMOD, CD49e/CD29, CG-a, and CG-b. the latter two glycoproteins (CG-a, CG-b) are particularly highlighted in the second view of the network. cluster 2 is characterized by the presence of links between immunoglobulins. mucins are mainly linked to the GlcNAc-1,3-Gal determinant. the di-LacNAc determinant (Gal-1,4-GlcNAc-1,3-Gal-1,4-GlcNAc-1,2-Man) emerges from the two networks. four main clusters are identified in the Epa/Als network. the most relevant links are found in cluster 1 and it involves mucins. diseases associated include lung and intestinal adenocarcinomas. glycan array screening was performed to determine the specificities and affinities of N-Als3p to mucin. SPR experiments confirmed the binding of N-Als3p to GlcNAc. binding of N-Als3p to FN and laminin was also determined. the LGI network of E. coli FimH-LD with viral envelope glycoproteins displays the connections of FimH-LD and the glycans to several viral glycoproteins through glycan determinants. linked viruses include HIV, Sendai virus, Friend murine virus, MARV and influenza A virus. the affinity of the LD of FimH for gp120 from HIV-1(IIIB) and HIV-1(YU2) was kinetically characterized by SPR. fimH-LD shows very low association rate constants (kon values 2 to 4 M1 s1), but also very low dissociation rate constants (koff values 104 s1) the interaction of FimH-LD with the viral envelope protein could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by both disaccharides that showed a similar inhibitory concentration but a slightly higher specificity for the -1,3-linked mannobiose. an additional confirmation of the interaction of FimH-LD with gp120 was obtained by AFM-SMFS. the EC50s were 34.3 6.1 (n = 8) and 74.5 19.2 (n = 6) g/ml. the 50% cytotoxic concentration was >500 g/ml. there was no cytotoxicity observed at all at 500 g/ml. fimbriated E. coli is able to recognize Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, also known as uromodulin (UMOD) (51) the binding to this protein was confirmed by the network strategy (Fig. 1). a genetically engineered strain that expresses type 1 fimbriae can adhere to breast cancer cells overexpressing the EGFR and block the EGFR signaling pathway (55). the effect of fimbriae on receptor signaling has been described as mannose sensitive. female patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to UTIs than healthy patients because of the greater adherence of type 1 fimbriated E. coli to bladder cells. glycan array screening was performed to determine the carbohydrate-binding specificity of N-Als3p. a large set of potential binding receptors may be recognized by the glycan array. several glycan determinants are linked to mucins. mucins are the main constituents of the extracellular secreted mucus and cell surface glycocalyx. the binding of Epa adhesins to mucin-type O-glycans has also been described. a connection between the Epa proteins and CD43 (leukosialin)/CD45 (receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C) is also present in the LGI network. this is justified by the presence of the T antigen that is linked to leukemia- and HIV-associated CD45 and to WAS-associated CD43. Epa proteins are linked to FN; i.e., Epa1p and Epa7p are linked to FN of fibroblasts by LacNAc-terminated N-glycan branches. adhesin domain is able to bind FN with submicromolar affinity in a carbohydrate-sensitive manner. a connection between Als proteins and FN was not found in the network. the interaction of Als3p with these receptors triggers autophosphorylation, which leads to endocytosis of C. albicans by host cells. additional reported experimental results confirmed some Als LGI network nodes, such as for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, -casein, and CG-a/b. the full-length Als1 and Als3 adhesins showed significant binding to FN and laminin (18). compared to N-Als1p\u2013FN binding (22) and the N-Epa1p\u2013FN interaction (29), the N-Als3p\u2013FN interaction was >5-fold weaker. gp120\u2013FimH-LD affinity and inhibition results are compatible with a prevalent recognition of oligomannose 9 glycans on CHO-derived gp120. the related KD (572 nM) is very similar to the affinity of the LD for the same carbohydrate structure (400 nM) (11) fimH-LD is a protein belonging to the innate immune system. it is able to hamper both influenza A virus (81, 82) and MARV (83) infectivity and spreading in vitro. antiviral properties of lectins from algae against influenza A virus (43) have been demonstrated. glycan array screening results and a glycoprotein database inquiry allowed the profiling of potential glycoprotein binding targets. this strategy was adapted for the prediction of adhesin-viral glycoprotein interactions, validated by the discovery of anti-HIV activity of FimH. gp120 from HIV-1(IIIB), produced in CHO cells, and HIV-1(YU2), produced in insect cells, were purchased from Immunodiagnostics (Woburn, MA) -1,2-Mannobiose and -1,3-mannobiose were purchased from Sigma. TZM-bl cells were activated with 2 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days before infection with HIV expression and purification of FimH-LD, N-Als3p, N-Als1p, and N-Epa1p. the sequence of FimH-LD from E. coli K-12 (strain K514) was used for this work (residues 22 to 179; UniProt entry P08191) the results of the glycan array screenings for FimH-LD were retrieved from the CFG-Core H database. the results were filtered by removing the data of three times the standard error of the mean. harides composed of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbohydrate residues present at the nonreducing end were submitted to the GlycoSuiteDB database in the UniCarbKB platform (46, 47). the interactions were modeled as a weighted undirected graph G(V, E, W), where V is the set of vertices, and E is the set of edges connecting the pairs of vertices. the edges\u2019 weights were calculated according to the interaction type. PBMCs were resuspended in cell culture medium supplemented with 2 ng/ml IL-2 and seeded into 48-well plates containing various concentrations of test compounds. after 20 min of preincubation at 37\u00b0C, infection with HIV-1 was performed. IL-2 was added at days 3 and 6 postinfection. microscopically and aliquots were transferred to white Lumitrac 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) to measure luminescence units with a SpectraMax L microplate reader and SoftMax Pro Software (Molecular Devices), an integration time of 0.6 s. download Text S1, DOCX file, 1.3 MB (1.3MB, docx) Als3p glycan array screening graphs for concentrations of 200 (A) and 20 (C) g/ml are shown. glycan data analysis of N-Als3p and distribution of most prevalent ligands obtained for 200 (B) and 20 (D) g/ml are shown. the longest LacNAc glycan consists of nine repetitive units of LacNAc. the -linked antigen GalNAc is the best-binding monosaccharide at the 200-g/ml protein concentration. the lower protein concentration also binds to - and -linked, sulfated mannose and -linked fucose, galactose, and glucuronic acid. most hits showed a high coefficient of variation and were not considered for further analysis.
