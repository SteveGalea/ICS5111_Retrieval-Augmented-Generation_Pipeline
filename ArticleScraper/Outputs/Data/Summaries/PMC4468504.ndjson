{"summary": "innate features of Env appear to limit elicitation of bNAbs. native Env elicits rather weak or isolate specific neutralizing antibody. gp160, gp41 stumps, monomeric gp120, and nontrimeric Env debris often contaminate virions. BG505 SOSIP is a soluble (gp140) trimer that contains an engineered disulfide bond between gp120 and gp41 and a mutation (I559P) to disfavor aberrant forms of gp41 (18). this engineered trimer is recognized by most bNAbs but not by non-neutralizing antibodies, while cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography no immunization study has been described that uses purified native spikes. cross-linker can alter bNAb epitopes in a concentration-dependent manner. cross-linker can alter bNAb epitopes in a concentration-dependent manner. cross-linked spikes elicited antibodies that neutralized relatively resistant tier 1a and tier 2 isolates of HIV-1. the neutralization of sensitive tier 1a strains, associated with V3 crown antibodies, was clearly diminished. pLAI-JR-FL contains the env ectodomain (amino acids [aa] 24 to 692) of JR-FL in the pLAI.2 backbone plasmid (15). pMV-5001 and related variants encode codon-optimized env from the JR-CSF isolate. env variants with domain swaps between JR-CSF and JR-FL were generously provided by R. Whalen (Altravax) mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was obtained commercially. monomeric JR-FL gp120, gp140-foldon (FT) trimers and JR-FL gp140 SOSIP trimers were donated. cross-linkers bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce) and 3,3\u2032-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) were dissolved in PBS immediately before use. cross-linkers were added to a final concentration of 1 mM. unless otherwise noted, cross-linkers were added to a final concentration of 1 mM. gels were run at room temperature using running buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. microtiter wells were coated with galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) at 5 g/ml in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed, and virus solubilized in 1% Empigen was added protein M41xt were directly coated onto microtiter wells. a constant concentration of biotinylated monoclonal antibody was prepared. a titration of immune serum was added at the same time. BS3-cross-linked virions were solubilized in PBS containing 0.1% n-dodecyl--d-maltoside (DDM) cross-linked virion-associated Env in (immunodepleted) supernatant was added at a 5:1 ratio to anti-FLAG M2 IgG-coupled agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature. antibody-coupled magnetic beads were incubated with detergent-treated cross-linked viral supernatants for 3 h at room temperature. then washed three times with PBSD. lipids were then added to magnetic beads containing cross-linked trimers. 3-cross-linked and purified JR-FL Env trimers incorporated in PLNs (50 g of Env) groups A, B, and D received 100 g of CpG ODN 2007 as an adjuvant. group C received both 100 g of CpG ODN 2007 and alum (Pierce), mixed at a 1:1.4 alum/boosting protein ratio. ear bleeds were performed 14 days postprime and postboost pLAI-JR-FL contains the env ectodomain (amino acids [aa] 24 to 692) of JR-FL in the pLAI.2 backbone plasmid (15). pcDNA-JR-FL matches env from pLAI-JR-FL (10) TZM-bl cells (44) were obtained from the NIH ARRRP. 293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. MT2-CCR5CT cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was obtained commercially. monomeric JR-FL gp120 was purchased from Progenics. monomeric JR-FL gp120 was purchased from Progenics. cross-linkers and virus were added to a final concentration of 1 mM. the reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min. bNAbs and virus were heated for 1 h or incubated at 37\u00b0C. microtiter wells were coated with galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) at 5 g/ml in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed and blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in PBS. virus solubilized in 1% Empigen was added. a dilution series of Empigen-lysed virus was added to wells. the concentration of viral Env was interpolated against a sequence-matched JR-FL gp120 (Progenics) standard curve by Prism software (GraphPad) microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C using 50 l of a 5-g/ml concentration of sheep anti-p24 (Aalto) BS3-cross-linked virions were solubilized in PBS containing 0.1% n-dodecyl--d-maltoside (DDM) cross-linked virion-associated Env in (immunodepleted) supernatant was added at a 5:1 ratio to anti-FLAG M2 IgG-coupled agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature. lipids were resuspended in PBS by sonicating for 5 min on a 4\u00b0C water bath. DDM was added to a final concentration of 1%. beads were recovered, washed three times in PBS, and stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C. group C received both 100 g of pG ODN 2007 and alum (Pierce) mixed at a 1:1.4 alum/boosting protein ratio. preparation of negative stain electron microscopy grids, data collection, and image processing were performed. in its native state, we chose to use the JR-FL molecular clone produced by transfection of 293T cells. we settled on BS3 due to its defined chemical properties and clarity of the cross-linked trimer band on BN-PAGE. when tested for its resistance to destabilizing conditions, BS3-cross-linked Env remained trimeric after 1 h at 57\u00b0C, after 96 h in DDM detergent, and even after boiling for 5 min BS3-cross-linked virions were detergent solubilized, and then Env was captured on immobilized GNL. panel of antibodies included PG9 and PG16 (gp120 V2/V3) and PGT151 and 35O22 (gp120-gp41 interface) bNAbs used have an IC50 of 50 g/ml against JR-FL. non-neutralizing antibodies have an IC50 of >50 g/ml. PG9/PG16, PGT151, and 35O22 all recognized BS3-cross-linked Env but not un-cross-linked Env. BS3 cross-linking of virion-displayed spikes occludes the V3 crown, slightly restricts some CD4bs epitopes, has no effect on the gp41 MPER and largely preserves quaternary epitopes on V2. virions were treated using a 3-fold dilution series of BS3. binding by bNAb causes bNAb spikes to run slower on the gel (11) binding by bNAb causes spikes to run slower on the gel (11) IgG fragments antigen-binding (Fabs) of b12, 2G12, PGT151, 10E8, PGT126, PG9, 4E10, and Z13e1 all retarded the electrophoretic mobility of cross-linked spikes. non-neutralizing antibodies b6 and D stoichiometry was calculated by measuring the distance of the gel mobility shift and comparing Fabs of known stoichiometry against un-cross-linked JR-FL. domain-swapped 2G12 is an F(ab\u2032)2 and induces a gel mobility shift that is approximately twice what would be expected. cross-linking significantly enhances thermostability of bNAb epitopes. an extreme temperature disrupts the antigenicity of Env. bNAb epitopes are relatively thermostable. bNAb epitopes on spikes are sensitive to reduction regardless of cross-linking. BS3 helps occlude V3 and non-neutralizing epitopes while stabilizing the gp120-gp41 interface primarily through conformational restriction. virions were cross-linked using BS3 or its disulfide-containing analog DTSSP. detergent-solubilized Env was treated as in panel A against a broader panel of bNAbs at a single concentration (1 g/ml) the percent change in OD at 450 nm is plotted for each condition relative to untreated Env. the distance between the side chain primary amines of two lysine residues is labeled by the dotted line. the subscript in the residue number indicates which gp120 protomer the residue belongs to. a combination of an intraprotomer cross-link between V3 and V1/V2 and an interprotomer cross-link between two V1/V2 regions could block accessibility to the V3 crown epitope. BS3-cross-linking stabilizes a conformation of V3 and N332 supersite on native spikes that is fundamentally different from that of soluble gp120 and uncleaved gp140 molecules. effects of BS3 treatment on monomeric gp120, gp140-foldon (FT) trimers, and solubilized spikes (all JR-FL) as probed by antibodies are presented as the fold change in ELISA binding. binding of six different non-neutralizing antibodies was reduced to near background levels by immunodepletion. we conclude that immunodepletion of solubilized Env molecules using non-neutralizing antibodies can effectively remove contaminating species of Env from cross-linked spike preparations. each antibody at 10 g/ml from at least three independent experiments. a FLAG epitope tag was genetically fused to the C terminus of full-length gp160 JR-FL Env. BS3-cross-linked FLAG-tagged spikes were purified using immunodepletion-affinity-purification scheme. affinity-purified BS3-cross-linked Env spikes were analyzed using negative-stain electron microscopy. reference-free 2D class averaged EM reconstructions of BS3-cross-linked JR-FL spikes. gp120 and gp41 ectodomain regions are shaded blue, while the TM and CT domains encapsulated in a DDM micelle are shaded yellow. the predicted location of the trimer ectodomain (gp120, cyan; gp41, blue; PDB ID 4TVP) is shown for comparison. PLNs were analyzed by GNL-capture ELISA. a 5-fold dilution series of PLNs was added to microtiter wells. sera from day 0 (prebleed), day 42 (post-DNA prime) and day 98 (post-protein boost) were tested for neutralization activity. cross-linked spikes were captured onto nanobeads conjugated to anti-FLAG antibody (80) lipids were then added at a ratio that mimics that of the native viral membrane (68). ELISA analysis confirmed incorporation of Env spikes and lipids into PLNs. sera from groups A and D were further compared against a larger panel of 12 clade B isolates using the TZM-bl assay. cross-linked trimer PLN boosted sera (group D) 7549 and 7547 showed a modest but consistent neutralization (IC50 = 5 to 11 dilution) against 8/12 and 2/12 isolates. antibody specificities in serum 7547 responsible for potent neutralization of JR-CSF. antibody specificities in rabbit 7547 were not applicable because the serum did not neutralize the corresponding virus. gp120 virions contain substitutions of major domains from gp120. sera 7548 and 7549 were also tested for neutralization of mutants V4-GGS33 and N301Q. most of the neutralization by PLN-boosted sera 7549 and 7548 against HxB2 and SF162 was depleted. sera were incubated with TriMut core or TriMut368/370. sera were then tested for neutralization of HxB2, JR-CSF, SF162, TRO.11, and SC422661. antibody binding specificities boosted by HIV-1 spikes. the data points correspond to individual sera from day 42 () and day 98 () the data points correspond to individual sera from day 42 () and day 98 () the data points correspond to individual sera from day 42 () and day 98 () cognate means are shown as dashed and solid lines. sera were tested in a competition ELISA to determine if they could block representative bNAbs from binding to recombinant JR-FL gp120 or gp41. all of the sera blocked b12 binding, suggesting the presence of CD4bs antibodies. however, competition was weaker against the more potent bNAb VRC01 in which only serum 7549 achieved 50% inhibition. non-neutralizing antibody immunodepletion and PLN display of cross-linked Env spikes (group D) reduced immunodominant antibody responses to gp120 (V3) and gp41 (DSL) but also directed responses to novel, apparently less immunogenic epitopes. virions were treated with 1 mM BS3 or left untreated and then incubated at either 37\u00b0C or 57\u00b0C for 1 h. untreated and BS3-cross-linked virions were incubated in Laemmli buffer with DTT for 5 min, run on SDS-PAGE. untreated and BS3-cross-linked virions were incubated in 1% DDM detergent at 37\u00b0C for up to 4 days and then analyzed by BN-PAGE and Western blotting. bNAbs PG9/PG16, PGT151, and 35O22 all recognized BS3-cross-linked Env but not un-cross-linked Env. bNAbs were either treated with 1 mM BS3 or left untreated. the virions were detergent solubilized, and Env was captured on GNL. BS3-cross-linking did not alter binding by 2G12 and MPER antibodies. but BS3 diminished binding of CD4bs ligands b12 and CD4-IgG2 by 4- and 15-fold, respectively, but had negligible effect on VRC01 and PGV04. BS3 cross-linking strongly reduced binding of six different non-neutralizing antibodies by up to 3 orders of magnitude regardless of epitope. CD4bs antibody b6 was the exception in which binding was reduced only 4-fold. binding by bNAb causes Env spikes to run slower on the gel (11) binding by bNAb causes spikes to run slower on the gel (11) either BS3 cross-linked or untreated, were incubated with various antibodies, and Env was resolved using BN-PAGE. gel mobility shifts induced by antibodies were quantified using imaging software, including antibodies not shown in panel A. bNAb epitopes on cross-linked viral Env were generally more stable than on sequence-matched JR-FL SOSIP gp140. incubation at higher temperatures (i.e., 70\u00b0C) largely eliminated bNAb binding to Env. an extreme temperature disrupts the antigenicity of Env. BS3 on binding by certain antibodies were due to direct chemical modification of epitopes or indirect (allosteric) fixation of Env quaternary structure. we made use of a disulfide containing cleavable homolog of BS3, DTSSP. we first verified that both cross-linkers caused a comparable diminution in binding to Env by V3 crown binders. bNAb epitopes on spikes are sensitive to reduction regardless of cross-linking. gp120-gp41 interface primarily through conformational restriction. bNAb epitopes on spikes are sensitive to reduction regardless of cross-linking. possible cross-links that could be formed at the trimer apex are shown on the crystal structure of BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB ID 4TVP) (26). only lysine residues that are shared between BG505 and JR-FL are shown. BS3-cross-linking stabilizes conformation of V3 and N332 supersite on native spikes. binding by gp120 and gp140-FT decreased only 2- to 3-fold. nontrimeric and/or immature species of Env that bear non-neutralizing epitopes account for 5 to 20% of Env associated with JR-FL virions. BN-PAGE analysis revealed that this immunodepletion step removed heterogeneous Env contaminants, leaving behind only trimeric spikes. ELISA showed that the binding of six different non-neutralizing antibodies was reduced to near background levels by immunodepletion. virions were cross-linked using cleavable BS3 analog, DTSSP. Western blots shown were blotted with anti-gp41 antibodies. the arrow denotes the gp120-gp41 trimer. the average OD at 450 nm for each antibody at 10 g/ml. gp160 samples were assayed for infectivity in a single-cycle infectivity assay using TZM-bl cells (solid bar), gp120 incorporation (normalized for p24 input and measured by GNL-capture ELISA; checkered bar), and replication in MT2-CCR5CT cells (p24 equivalents at day 7 relative to wild type; hatched bar). the western blot was probed using an anti-gp41 antibody cocktail reference-free 2D class averaged EM reconstructions of BS3-cross-linked JR-FL spikes. in the image, gp120 and gp41 ectodomain regions are shaded blue. TM and CT domains encapsulated in a DDM micelle are shaded yellow. cross-linked spikes were captured onto 200-nm magnetic particles to generate PLNs. PLNs were analyzed by GNL-capture ELISA. a 5-fold dilution series of PLNs was added to GNL-coated microtiter wells. PLNs present cross-linked Env as particulate boosting agent. cross-linked spikes were captured onto nanobeads conjugated to anti-FLAG antibody. lipids were then added at a ratio that mimics that of the native viral membrane. sera from groups A and D were further compared against a larger panel of 12 clade B isolates using the TZM-bl assay. cross-linked trimer PLN boosted sera (group D) 7549 and 7547 showed a modest but consistent neutralization (IC50 = 5 to 11 dilution) against 8/12 and 2/12 isolates. cross-linking Env likely reduces immunogenicity of the V3 crown. this thereby diminishing neutralization of strains sensitive to V3 antibodies. antibodies in rabbit 7547 target C3 and V5 on JR-CSF gp120. sera 7548 and 7549 were also tested for neutralization. most of the neutralization by PLN-boosted sera 7549 and 7548 against HxB2 and SF162 was depleted by TriMut. serum 7540 was also unaffected by TriMut cross-reactive CD4bs antibodies. the antibodies neutralize tier 1 and not tier 2 isolates. serum 7540 was also unaffected by TriMut. ELISA binding to BS3-cross-linked bovine serum albumin was only observed with sera from group B. BS3-cross-linked VLPs may present a relatively high number and diversity of BS3 epitopes in the immunogen. sera were tested using the scaffold RSC3 that specifically binds CD4bs bNAbs. binding was weak relative to VRC01 and neutralization was adsorbed using TriMut only with serum 7549. competition ELISA was weaker against more potent bNAb VRC01. non-neutralizing antibody immunodepletion and PLN display of cross-linked Env spikes (group D) reduced immunodominant antibody responses to gp120 (V3) and gp41 (DSL) but also directed responses to novel, apparently less immunogenic epitopes. cross-linked spikes on PLNs elicit intriguing neutralizing antibody responses using strategies that seem eligible for improvement. quaternary epitopes as well as the N332 supersite were shown in binding assays to be enhanced relative to un-cross-linked Env. the reactivity of certain CD4bs bNAbs bNAbs was slightly reduced by cross-linking spikes. however, we observed antibodies to the CD4bs in antisera boosted by Env spikes. soluble monomers and uncleaved soluble trimers are absent on soluble monomers and uncleaved soluble trimers. BS3 seems to stabilize the entire N332 epitope cluster in a uniquely accessible conformation on native Env. gp120 and gp140-FT trimers have been cross-linked in complex with CD4. cross-linking prevents decay of trimeric Env, whereas immunodepletion using different non-neutralizing antibodies enriches for Env that is trimeric, cleaved, and more native-like. cross-linking negatively impacted processing into peptides for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) display. cross-linked spike PLNs elicited a more diverse neutralization response than that of VLPs. PLN-immunized rabbits received 2-fold more total Env than VLP-immunized rabbits. cross-linked spikes alone at the same dose did not appear to be immunogenic. a serum elicited by the PLN boost (7547) showed relatively potent neutralization against tier 2 isolate JR-CSF. this activity only appeared after the PLN boost (7547) SF by serum 7549 was mostly abrogated by mutations to V4. boosting with JR-FL Env did not elicit antibodies able to neutralize autologous virus. this may be a case of \"original antigenic sin\" (96) whereby B cells triggered by JR-CSF in the DNA prime were boosted by low affinity engagement of BCRs amplified by multivalent presentation of JR-FL spikes on PLNs. redirect and slightly diversify HIV-1 neutralizing antibody responses. future directions will be aimed at determining whether more consistent and potent neutralizing antibodies responses can be elicited."}
