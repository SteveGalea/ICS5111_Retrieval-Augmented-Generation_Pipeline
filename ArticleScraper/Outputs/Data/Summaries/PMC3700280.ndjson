{"summary": "TEXT Ebola virus is one of the most virulent human pathogens. infection with the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) species results in up to 90% mortality. pigs have been established as a new intermediate host for Ebola. there is the potential for Ebola to overwhelm larger populations. def201 is a replication-defective recombinant human adenovirus of serotype 5 (AdHu5) expressing consensus human alpha interferon (IFN-) (13) it was previously investigated as a broad-spectrum antiviral and shown to be effective against several viral pathogens (14\u201318) safety and toxicity studies on def201 in rodents indicate tolerability meeting regulatory requirements. guinea pigs were treated either intramuscularly (i.p.) with 2 108 PFU DEF201 per animal 1 day postinfection (d.p.i.) or with equal amounts of 1H3, 2G4, and 4G7 MAbs totaling 10 mg per animal 3 d.p.i. the difference between the two studies (33% and 67%) is not statistically significant. increased survival and extended postexposure treatment window in guinea pigs Expt Treatment (amt in mg) Time of treatment (d.p.i.) with: Mean time to death SD (no. of animals that died) E03 30 DEF201+MAbs (10) 2 4 NA 6/6 6.00E04 5 DEF201+MAbs (10) 2 5 NA 6/6 6.00E04 7 DEF201+MAbs (10) 2 6 10.25 1.71 (4) 2/6 2.90E03 23 4 PBS 7.50 0.55 (6) 0/6 NA 16 MAbs only (5) 3 9.17 2.14 (6) 0/6 5.53E02 31 DEF201+MAbs (5) 3 3 11.60 def201a MAbsb 1 MAbs only (10) 3 AdHu5-lacZ+MAbs (10) 3 3 8.36E01 MAbs only (10) 3 DEF201+MAbs (10) 3 3 1.79E02 AdHu5-lacZ+MAbs (10) 3 3 DEF201+MAbs (10) 3 3 1.85E02 2 AdHu5-lacZ+MAbs (10) 1 6 DEF201+MAbs (10) 1 6 4.00 EBOV was detected by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of the blood of infected animals in selected treatment groups at 0, 3, 7, 14 and 22 d.p.i. the level of viremia was found to correlate with survival. single DEF201 and 10-mg-MAb treatments were both able to delay and suppress viremia. guinea pigs tested for viremia levels Treatment (amt in mg) Time of treatment (d.p.i.)
