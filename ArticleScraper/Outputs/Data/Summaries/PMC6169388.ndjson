{"summary": "slippery site data We obtained a dataset of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain genes with predicted -1 PRF events. these putatitve -1 PRF signals were identified using first a filter for slippery site identification. a site must match the pattern (X XXY YYZ), where X is some base, Y is either A or U, and Z is A, C or U. s from 46 further studies, specified in (von der Haar 2008) were obtained from yeast grown in rich medium. transcriptome data for mRNA levels were obtained from 6000 genes. the ribosomal genes were taken from the ribosome.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp database. data Availability The code used for analysis of the data is available on Figshare. protein expression and mRNA level data We obtained protein expression as well as mRNA level data from the Supporting Information of (von der Haar 2008). additional data stems from 46 further studies, specified in (von der Haar 2008). the codon adaptation index is defined as C A I mRNA 1 L a A c C a o a c ln (a c ref ). for the reference sequence, we concatenated all of the mRNA of ribosomal genes. the ribosomal genes were taken from the ribosome database. the second element is a spacer sequence, separating the slippery site from the third element. the third element is a pseudoknot, an mRNA secondary structure that is thought to generate a mechanical tension on the spacer sequence when the slippery site is being translated. to release the tension, the ribosome, while stalling at the slippery site, is pushed one nucleotide back. the mRNA sequence with -1 PRF is termed x \u2032. this is the concatenation of the mRNA x until the slippery site (green) and the -1 frame after the slippery site until a premature termination codon is encountered (violet) effects imply an asymmetry in the probability of slippery site loss. -1 PRF signals should thus become rarer with increasing protein expression levels. ribosomes slip through -1 PRF every time ribosomes slip through. the frequency of slippery sites positions diminishes toward both extremes of mRNA sequences, and more markedly so toward the stop codon of the mRNA. this skew persists when including all genes from the PRFdb (see Figure S2). the mean of the distribution, as well as its 95% confidence intervals, are smaller than 0.5 - the expectation in the absence of selective pressure. the red line is the average slippery site position (computed across 20 bins of equal width in logarithmic scale) we define the efficiency of the protein synthetisation process as the energy content of the proteins (the nominator) divided by the energy expended by the mRNA transcription and translation processes (the denominator) the same mRNA considering a slippery site (green point) a substantial fraction of genes may contain -1 PRF signals. neglecting this effect might introduce considerable biases in CUB index values. these biases could affect the associations found between CUB and protein expression. codon usage bias index values saturate with increasing translation efficiency values. x is the ratio of the total per-protein energy E p ( x ) contained in the n ( x ) synthesized proteins from x to the energy, E i ( x ). a part of the expended energy on translation is not implemented in the proteins, but in the translation of x \u2032 and the NMD pathway activation, E i ( x \u2032 ). a part of the expended energy on translation is not implemented in the proteins, but in the translation of x \u2032 and the NMD pathway activation, E i ( x \u2032. the ratio is approximated by information about the relative one-elongation energies spent translating x and x \u2032. each time x is translated, an energy input of T ( x ) E i ( x ) / n ( x ) is expended per time unit t. ratio of translation energies expended for non-frameshifting corresponds roughly to the ratio of lengths of the translated sequences x \u2032 to x. however, there is an extra cost to each frameshifted mRNA, x \u2032 stemming from NMD-mediated degradation. this cost is accounted for by, which is an unknown fixed cost associated with each -1 PRF event. I c ( x ) should approximate some minimal value I c, min ( x ) = F ( 0. p is assumed to lie between 1 10 %, but may reach up to 70 %. we have found no indication that the energy required to fully complete the NMD process will substantially vary from mRNA to mRNA within an organism. however, we assume that is uniform across genes, although we do not know how large it is relative to other energy inputs. the major drawback of the estimator I a ( x ) is its dependence on p. however, I a ( x ) has the advantage that it is also well defined for p = 1. -1 PRF signals with a -1 PRF efficiency of up to p = 0.3 does not substantially affect the CUB index to protein expression relationship for both CUB index corrections. if the extra cost of mRNA degradation by NMD is neglected, the extra cost of mRNA degradation by NMD is neglected ( = 0. sensitivity of I c to -1 PRF efficiency is mediated by the value of. correlations between I c and I a to protein expression levels decline for increasing values of p and different values of. correlations of corrected CAI to protein expression levels decline with p. for uniform -1 PRF efficiencies and for I c -based estimates, correlation seems generally robust to changes in p. corrections to I c are expected to be larger at low expression levels than at high levels. the cost of -1 PRF maintenance classically comprise three constitutive elements. the first element is a heptameric sequence \u2013the slippery site. the second element is a spacer sequence, separating the slippery site from the third element. the frequency with which the ribosome is redirected to the -1 frame is called -1 PRF efficiency. we assume that mutations that alter CUB are accumulated more slowly than mutations that alter -1 PRF efficiency, p. mRNA sequence with -1 PRF is termed x \u2032. this is the concatenation of the mRNA x until the slippery site (green) and the -1 frame after the slippery site until a premature termination codon is encountered. osomes slip through -1 PRF, the energy of translating a stretch of length l + of mRNA is wasted for protein production. the cost to translational efficiency incurred from -1 PRF should depend on l. therefore, diminishing l will minimize cost. this effect is expected to be weaker than the effect in the first hypothesis. the average slippery site position is displaced toward the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA as protein expression levels increase from 102 molecules per cell to 105 molecules per cell. above 105 molecules per cell, the uncertainty around the averages becomes large due to low sample sizes. the average slippery site position (computed across 20 bins of equal width) and the widgets are the uncertainty ( 1.96 standard error of the mean) around the average estimate. a regression line with the corresponding correlation coefficient r (with p-value) and slope (with p-value) are added. the slippery site redirects ribosomes to a -1 shifted frame. the same number of proteins are produced as in A. an additional cost, unaccounted for in A), is incurred for protein production. we propose two general corrections for CUB indices in the presence of -1 PRF signals. in the absence of a -1 PRF signal, the CUB on x will be measured by some index function I ( x ). if a functional -1 PRF signal is present, the CUB on x will be measured by some index function I ( x ). translation efficiency ( x ) is the ratio of the total per-protein energy E p ( x ) contained in the n ( x ) synthesized proteins from x to the energy, E i ( x ). the energy going into the synthesization machinery, E i ( x ), does not contain the expenditure for -1 PRF\u2019s regulatory use. translation efficiency c ( x ) is separated into two components: c ( x ) = ( x ) + Q ( x, x \u2032 ) = n ( x ) E p ( x ) + E i ( x \u2032 ). the ratio is approximated by information about the relative one-elongation energies spent translating x and x \u2032. each time x is translated, an energy input of T ( x ) E i ( x ) / n ( x ) is expended per time unit t. the ratio of the per-run translation energies expended for the non-frameshifting corresponds roughly to the ratio of the lengths of the translated sequences x \u2032 to x, respectively. however, there is an extra cost to each frameshifted mRNA, x \u2032 stemming from NMD-mediated degradation. this cost is accounted for by, which is an unknown fixed cost associated with each -1 PRF event. the approximation for R ( x, x \u2032 ) results in reasonable and useful properties of c ( x ). this entails that no mRNA is translated into proteins, as expected. p is assumed to lie between 1 10 %, but may reach 70 %. we have found no indication that the energy required to fully complete the NMD process will substantially vary from mRNA to mRNA within an organism. therefore, we assume that = 0 in order to give a conservative estimate of the effects of -1 PRF on the TEH. both corrections I c and I a represent a change in the value of a codon usage bias index given a -1 PRF efficacy. the models for correcting I presented here do not relate these measures to protein expression levels, P. instead, they allow us to reexamine the association between protein expression and a corrected codon usage bias index that underpins the TEH. the effect of accounting for -1 PRF is to shift and broaden the distribution of I a ( x ) values relative to I ( x ). the original codon adaptation index values of mRNA sequences x of genes from the (von der Haar 2008) data set are shown as orange, semi-transparent points. correlations\u2019 dependency on p is moderate, never falling below 0.4 at biologically implausible values of p of unity. for I c, we considered different values of, the cost of degrading an mRNA after -1 PRF, namely = 0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. correlations of corrected CAI to protein expression levels decline with p. they only become sufficiently diminished to challenge the TEH when both the values of and p are very high. for I c, correlation seems generally robust to changes in p. expression and I c rise with larger baseline -1 PRF efficiencies. most correlations between I c -based estimates and protein expression rise with -1 PRF baselines. except for = 10000, all correlation values increase with -1 PRF baselines. -1 PRF conceals stronger associations than measured with uncorrected codon usage bias indices. translation efficiency ( x ) is the ratio of the total per-protein energy E p ( x ) contained in the n ( x ) synthesized proteins from x to the energy, E i ( x ). the energy going into the synthesization machinery, E i ( x ), does not contain the expenditure for -1 PRF\u2019s regulatory use. a part of the expended energy on translation is not implemented in the proteins, but in the translation of x \u2032 and the NMD pathway activation, E i ( x \u2032 ). the corrected usage bias statistic I c ( x ) is defined as I c ( x ) F ( c ( x ) = F ( n ( x ) E p ( x ) + E i ( x \u2032 ) the ratio is approximated by information about the relative one-elongation energies spent translating x and x. each time x is translated, an energy input of T ( x ) E i ( x ) / n ( x ) is expended per time unit t. the ratio of the per-run translation energies expended for the non-frameshifting corresponds roughly to the ratio of the lengths of the translated sequences x \u2032 to x. however, there is an extra cost to each frameshifted mRNA, x \u2032 stemming from NMD-mediated degradation. this cost is accounted for by, which is an unknown fixed cost associated with each -1 PRF event. the approximation for R ( x, x \u2032 ) results in reasonable and useful properties of c ( x ). this entails that no mRNA is translated into proteins, as expected. p is assumed to lie between 1 10 %, but may reach 70 %. we have found no indication that the energy required to fully complete the NMD process will substantially vary from mRNA to mRNA within an organism. if not stated otherwise, we assume that = 0 in order to give a conservative estimate of the effects of -1 PRF on the TEH. both corrections I c and I a represent a change in the value of a codon usage bias index given a -1 PRF efficacy. the models for correcting I presented here do not relate these measures to protein expression levels, P. instead, they allow us to reexamine the association between protein expression and a corrected codon usage bias index that in part underpins the TEH. corrected and original codon adaptation indices vs. protein expression levels for genes containing algorithmically identified -1 PRF signals. red, semi-transparent points denote the values of -1 PRF corrected CAI values, I c, vs. same protein expression levels. correlations\u2019 dependency on p is moderate, never falling below 0.4 at biologically implausible values of p of unity. for I c, we considered different values of, the cost of degrading an mRNA after -1 PRF, namely = 0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. for each gene, the -1 PRF efficiency is computed by p = p b / log 10 ( P ). correlations of corrected CAI to protein expression levels decline with p. they only become sufficiently diminished to challenge the TEH when both the values of and p are very high. correlations between protein expression and I c rise with -1 PRF baselines. except for = 10000, all correlation values increase with -1 PRF baselines. this also adds support for the TEH, suggesting that -1 PRF conceals stronger associations than measured with uncorrected codon usage bias indices. our study comes with a series of caveats. a first caveat lies in that the slippery sites are inferred. previous studies suggest that inferred slippery sites are likely to be functional. a spacer sequence of a minimum length of say, 8 nt, will prohibit slippery sites to be located within 8 nt of the mRNA end. this restriction will slightly bias the a priori position of candidate slippery sites. however, as average mRNA by far exceed this length, such a restriction cannot explain the effects documented here. despite these possible shortcomings, the assumption reflects key properties with which many CUB indices are designed. despite these possible shortcomings, the assumption reflects key properties with which many CUB indices are designed to mirror translational efficiency. -1 PRF maintenance induces a reduction of the size of l with increasing protein expression levels. significant reductions in l would diminish the penalization to the original, un-corrected CUB. this could only be compensated by increases of p or with protein expression levels. specific synonymous changes can influence mRNA splicing, mRNA secondary structure, protein stability as well as protein folding. a synonymous difference between mammalian cytoskeletal - and -actin proteins was found to affect co-translational processing, ubiquitination, and co-translational degradation. gene function is superimposed to what is expected from translational efficiency and accuracy optimization. differences in function within a gene\u2019s sequence also affect local CUB. -1 PRF is only one of many ways in which CUB may be influenced."}
