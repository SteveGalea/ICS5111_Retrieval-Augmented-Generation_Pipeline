{"summary": "scenario tree model is composed of three types of nodes representing cattle categorization, immunity, virus infection, and monitoring. the number of initial cattle was set as tens of thousands instead of the actual number of cattle in Nemuro. the total numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle were calculated as an output of the default or scenarios. all of the data used in the present scenario tree model were shown in Table 1. a stochastic scenario tree is composed of nodes representing cattle categorization, vaccination program, virus infection, and detection of BVD cattle. some of the 3\u20138 M cattle were considered to be TI with BVDV due to a decline of the maternal antibodies to a level that is insufficient for protection. in parallel, 3\u20138 M cattle were set to be injected with the first or second administration of the vaccine under the adoption of mass vaccination programs. in non-vaccinated cattle and insufficiently immunized cattle, TI cattle would be produced with a probability of transient infection with BVDV (Pt) all of the probabilities of showing clinical manifestations of BVD were defined according to the opinions of field veterinarians in Nemuro. PI cattle of 15\u201318 M were assumed to be rarely detected by clinical manifestations. transient infection of BVDV in cattle is mainly subclinical or clinical over a short period. in the present model, TI cattle from the >19 M group would only be detected by reproductive disorder with a probability of 30%. PI or TI cattle in the >19 M group were estimated to be screened with a certain test sensitivity (Seb) once a year. in the default setting, bulk milk tests were not performed (Seb was zero) all of the cattle in the herd are mandateorily tested for BVDV infection either by RT-PCR or virus isolation method. a scenario tree model for risk assessment is generally composed of three types of nodes, namely category nodes, infectious nodes, and detection nodes. the number of initial cattle was set as tens of thousands instead of the actual number of cattle in Nemuro district, Hokkaido Prefecture. BVD cattle were calculated as an output of the default or scenarios. the scenario tree was developed in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2013), using the software @Risk 6 (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) all of the 10,000 cattle were divided into five age groups: 1) 0\u20132 months (0\u20132 M); 2) 3\u20138 months (3\u20138 M); 3) 9\u201314 months (9\u201314 M); 4) 15\u201318 months (15\u201318 M); and 5) >19 months (>19 M). some of the 3\u20138 M cattle were considered to potentially be TI with BVDV due to a decline of the maternal antibodies to a level that is insufficient for protection. in the default setting, none of the cattle were set to be injected with vaccines and to possess sufficient maternal antibodies for protection against BVDV infection. in non-vaccinated cattle and insufficiently immunized cattle, TI cattle would be produced with a probability of transient infection with BVDV (Pt) TI cattle from the >19 M group would only be detected by reproductive disorder with a probability of 30%. delivery of the PI calf as an immature fetus would be caused by BVDV infection. in Nemuro, all of the lactating cows are mandatorily screened for BVDV infection. this screening test is usually performed over six month intervals during every spring and autumn. in the present model, PI or TI cattle in the >19 M group were estimated to be screened with a certain test sensitivity (Seb) once a year. scenario models were run with the use of communal pasture at a rate of 10\u201350%, and/or implementation of bulk milk tests with a test sensitivity of Seb. phase two scenario With an assumption that risk of BVD in cattle is reduced by the implementation of effective control measures, the Pp was changed from 0.4% as a default setting to either 0.13, or 0.04%. the numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle increased and the numbers of missed BVD cattle decreased with increases in rates of communal pasture use. the numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle detected and missed in the output of the bulk tank milk test were approximately equal to those with 40 and 20% of communal pasture use. the numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle were almost equal to those of detected BVD cattle in 50, 40 and 40% use rates of communal pasture tests respectively. the efficacy of the communal pasture test with low use rates would be equal to that of the bulk milk tests. the communal pasture test is more effective to control BVD during the early phase of a vaccination program than a screening test using bulk tank milk. Efficacies of bulk milk tests, common pasture test with coverage of 30% were compared. for each box-whisker plot, the width of the box represents the interquartile range; the black line indicates the mean; the ends of the whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentile respectively. Efficacies of vaccination with single-, double-, or triple-administrations were compared. the numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle increased with decreases in the number of vaccine administrations. the differences in the number of detected and missed BVD cattle between 10 and 50% were smaller under the vaccine programs incorporating a greater number of vaccine administrations. the numbers of detected and missed cattle by the bulk tank milk tests under these three vaccination scenarios were almost equal to those of detected BVD cattle in 20, 30 and 30% use rates of communal pasture tests respectively. the model run was conducted under several scenarios of BVDV prevalence. the numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle by the individual test prior to 30% communal pasture use were calculated in each of the scenarios. DISCUSSION We developed a stochastic scenario tree model to evaluate the control measures of BVD using the field data in Nemuro, Hokkaido. the results of model validation could support that the developed model would be reflecting the real situation with high confidence. in Scandinavian countries including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, BVD had been eradicated due to implementation of an eradication program without vaccination. the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. this may indicate that the adoption of the mass vaccination campaign would be the foremost intervention for BVD control to reduce the number of cattle infected with BVDV. the bulk tank milk test is unlikely to detect young PI heifers. the individual test rather than the bulk tank milk test is more effective to reduce PI cattle immediately after conducting the mass vaccination. the individual test with a lower coverage was equal to that of the bulk tank milk test in the present study. the decision to switch between implementation of the individual and screening test is critical so as to achieve risk management with high cost-effectiveness. scenario tree model was useful to simulate the BVD eradication program in the endemic area."}
