{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a swine infectious disease characterized by levels of susceptibility, high incidence, and fatality. the virus is the causative agent of PED, which was discovered in 1978 (6). PEDV invades the digestive system of pigs through the nose and mouth. porcine small intestinal epithelial cells were used as an in vitro model to investigate PEDV infection. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect differences in expression of the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1 and Mx2 genes at various time points post-infection. primer premier 5.0 software was used to design real-time PCR primers across gene exons. the gene was used as an internal control. the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. 105 cells per well were discarded, the cells were washed twice in PBS. 300 L of the PEDV solution (MOI = 0.1) was added into each well. three replicates were placed in each group and cultured for 2 h. pathological changes of the cells during each infection period were observed. 2O with a thermocycling program of 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 95\u00b0C for 5 s, and 60\u00b0C for 34 s. a melting curve analysis was executed after amplification as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min; 95\u00b0C for 15 s. BS phosphate buffer was purchased from Beijing Saintan Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) TRIzol reagent was purchased from Invitrogen (USA) the cells were centrifuged at 2,000 r/min for 5 min to remove cell debris. the supernatant was divided into a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and stored at 80\u00b0C. the cells were inoculated into a 12-well plate at a density of 1 105 cells per well. reaction systems included 10 L SYBR Premix ExTapTM II (2), 0.4 L for upstream and downstream primers (10 mol/L), 0.4 L ROX Reference Dye II (50), 2 L cDNA, and 6.8 L RNase-free ddH2O with a thermocycling program of 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 95\u00b0C for 5 s, and 60\u00b0C for 34 s. the level of RNA purity was tested by 1% agarose electrophoresis. the results indicated that the extracted RNA was of high quality without obvious degradation or DNA contamination. the OD260/OD280 value detected by NanoDrop ND-1000 was between 1.8 and 2.0. expressions of all antiviral genes were highly up-regulated (P 0.01) and peaked at 24 h. expressions of all antiviral genes were highly up-regulated (P 0.01) eans significant correlation (P 0.05), ** Means extremely significant correlation (P 0.01). differences in levels of transcriptions of some important immune factors in IPEC-J2 cells within 24 h following PEDV infection. expressions of IFN- and TNF- significantly decreased 4 h after infection, but IL-12 gene increased significantly. pathological changes in IPEC-J2 cells after PEDV infection were observed under a microscope. normal IPEC-J2 cells were full fusiform with clear boundaries and no overlap. however, 12 h later, cell shrinkage, elongation, and fusion occurred. correlation analysis of the differences in the level of antiviral gene expression and prediction of protein-protein interactions following PEDV Infection. transcriptions of five antiviral genes were found to be significantly and positively correlated with each other. changes in levels of IFN-, IFN-, TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 gene expression after PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. a systematic understanding of the interaction between PEDV and host natural immunity can provide us with new strategies for the prevention of PED. PEDV-mediated antagonization of the natural innate immune response. there are two main viral escape mechanisms: blocking the RIG-1/IPS1 signaling pathway by hiding its dsRNA. encoding an IFN antagonist protein to attack transmission of molecular signals in antiviral signaling pathways (18\u201320) eIF-2 is an interferon-induced antiviral protease that can recognize dsRNA and activate endonuclease (RNaseL), to degrade both viral mRNA and cellular RNA (22). studies have shown that porcine OAS1 can effectively inhibit the infectious activity of Japanese encephalitis virus, pseudorabies virus, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (23). proinflammatory cytokines have antiviral, antitumor, antiparasitic, and immune regulatory effects. no obvious lesions were observed in the cells at 4 h post-infection. at 24 h, the cellular pathological changes were the most severe. all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h. expressions of the antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines are positively correlated with the severity of the cytopathic effect following PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. additional data file.
