{"summary": "the invention of vaccination is regarded as one of the biggest triumphs in the history of medicine. but there are insufficient barriers to protect populations from diseases that may cause epidemics or pandemics. researchers are trying to increase the number of diseases that can be prevented by vaccines. people in the 12th to 15th centuries practiced 'variolation' [1,5], the first known method of human immunization. scabs or fluid from the pustules of a smallpox patient were inserted into superficial scratches made in the skin of the recipient. vaccines against adenovirus, poliovirus, Japanese B encephalitis virus, and influenza virus were developed in this stage [9,10] in the second half of the 20th century, defined by Hilleman [1] as the modern era, scientific improvements related to the screening and manufacturing of vaccines enabled the development of new types of vaccines. the development of recombinant viral vaccines using genetic engineering is another important step in the evolution of vaccinology. the first example of this type of vaccine was the vaccine against hepatitis B virus [16], and the human papillomavirus vaccine is another important example. clinical trials of this phase are conducted to demonstrate the immunogenicity of the relevant active component(s) and the safety profile of a candidate vaccine. in 'Phase II', the 'proof-of-concept' (PoC) of the vaccine product should be ensured. in 'Phase II', the 'proof-of-concept' of the vaccine product should be ensured. the final step in the clinical evaluation before product license is the 'Phase III' trial. this stage is intended to provide a pivotal conclusion needed for marketing approval. efficacy and safety of formulation(s) of the immunologically active component(s) must be assessed in the large-scale target population [18,21] in the united states, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was established to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines. the goal of modern vaccination may be expressed as to prevent or to cure as many diseases with vaccination as possible. most of the currently licensed adjuvanted vaccine products target influenza. emphasis on the importance of adjuvants is gradually increasing with the aging of the population. many experts expect adjuvants will be an essential component for widespread vaccine use in entire populations. the coverage of vaccines against diverse diseases will be expanded faster than ever. integration of knowledge about microbiology and immunology, establishment of efficient vaccine development strategies and streamlining of regulatory approval processes may facilitate this trend."}
