{"summary": "StralSV is a new structure-based algorithm for identifying and aligning structure fragments that have similarity to a reference protein. the algorithm can be used to determine regions of the protein that are relatively unique or that share structural similarity with proteins that would be considered distantly related. a serious limitation of sequence similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the lack of confidence in assigning residue-residue correspondences. more than 95% of all pair-wise alignments occurring in the so-called twilight zone (20-35% sequence identity) may be incorrect. even calculated structural alignments may be inaccurate. the complexity of such calculations remains a challenging development goal. the majority of the existing flexible protein structure alignment algorithms report only sequential alignments. the accuracy of calculated structural alignments can also depend on the nature of compared structural models. StralSV is an algorithm that identifies protein structural fragments having a 3D structure similar to that of a query structure. the algorithm uses a sliding-window approach for breaking the query structure into overlapping segments. each so-calculated query segment is then compared to all protein structures in the query structure. the LGA_S score is used to evaluate structure similarity between a query segment and detected similar fragments. a value of LGA_S of at least 50% is used as a cutoff to ensure there is sufficient structural similarity between the segment and the fragment over at least half the length of the segment. for the work reported here we selected a minimum span length of 5 (span_size = 5) from each alignment is extracted a set of spans. all alignments that contain at least one span of length no less than the specified minimum span length are deemed \"qualified hits\" the observed residues for positions 229 through 269 for poliovirus run as the query protein against the complete PDB database. the residues for positions 229-269 for poliovirus run as the query protein against the complete PDB database. 152 37 4 0 0 7 28 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 44 0 D 238 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 268 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 249 20 0 30 72 0 11 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 K 250 3 0 16 14 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 R 261 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 number of all PDB chains (SEQRES.all_list.11_03_09): 147,634; Structure: Polio RNApolym; Length: 461; MIN span: 5; Structure similarity: 55; LGA distance: 4.0; Window: 90; Legend:'s' AA reference sequence, 'd' dominant amino acid, '+' number of hits per position (max '+': n = 398).

Suitable parameters input to StralSV were expected to capture only structurally related fragments (i.e., the polymerases), whereas overly stringent parameters were expected to yield result sets lacking at least some of the polymerase fragments. fragments from seeded 38 polymerase structures were reliably captured within a set of window_size and distance_cutoff parameter values. window_size values smaller than 70 tended to yield qualified hit sets missing some of the 38 polymerases (i.e., true positives) for lesser (more stringent) values of distance_cutoff. window_size values smaller than 70 were sensitive to the distance cutoff value, yielding acceptable result sets only for narrow ranges of distance cutoff. Plotting of StralSV results StralSV produced variability matrices and sequence profiles from which were extracted data for analyzing related structure fragments and quantifying positional variability. we performed additional analyses in order to annotate the primary StralSV results. the literature was searched for evidence of functional annotation [18,21-31] for the most frequently observed residue positions. positions for which functional annotation was identified were marked in Figure 5. Effect of window size on numbers of positional hits per position. the hits were evaluated separately for each of windows 50, 70, 80 and 90, at six sequence positions selected to be representative of the types of frequency variation (of qualified hits) over the length of the polymerase. for each of the six selected positions, the following information was extracted from the StralSV matrix output file.

SCOP categorization of template fragments selected at each of six positions along poliovirus RdRp. StralSV is an algorithm that identifies protein structural fragments having a 3D structure similar to that of a query structure. the algorithm uses a sliding-window approach for breaking the query structure into overlapping segments. the query structure is thus split into overlapping segments of length window_size. a final segment is taken one window_size in length extending from the C-terminus to ensure that all portions of the query structure are represented within a segment of exactly the window_size. each so-calculated query segment is then compared to all protein structures in the database using the LGA (local-global alignment) code [16]. a desired size of a calculated span is used as an input parameter to StralSV. from each alignment is extracted a set of spans. all alignments that contain at least one span of length no less than the specified minimum span length are deemed \"qualified hits\" the sample profile given in Table 2 shows the observed residues for positions 229 through 269 for poliovirus RNA polymerase (RdRp) run as the query protein against the complete PDB database. the sample profile given in Table 2 shows the observed residues for positions 229 through 269. 0 0 0 0 4 7 144 0 0 0 G 236 23 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 139 0 13 5 48 0 11 13 0 1 Y 237 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 139 0 13 5 48 0 11 13 0 1 Y 237 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 10 12 44 18 22 145 2 0 A 248 44 135 59 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 12 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 L 249 20 0 0 30 72 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 each row comprises a tally of the amino acids of each type (including non-standard indicated by 'X') from the corresponding positions in all qualified template fragments (positional hits) the following heading provides the total number of templates searched plus other run parameters.

Suitable parameters input to StralSV were expected to capture only structurally related fragments. overly stringent parameters were expected to yield result sets lacking at least some polymerase fragments. we ran StralSV using each window_size/distance_cutoff combination for all query (poliovirus RdRp) segments enclosing residue G64. the region defined by residues 1-140 tended to be structurally unique. the selection of fragments to inspect from within this region was somewhat arbitrary. we used StralSV to analyze sequence variability in structure context for poliovirus RdRp (PDB: 1ra6; [19]) using minimum span length of 5, LGA_S cutoff 55%, and window_size/distance_cutoff combinations 50/2.5, 70/3.5, 80/4.0, and 90/4.0. we performed additional analyses in order to annotate primary StralSV results. the literature was searched for evidence of functional annotation [18,21-31] for the most frequent residue positions. positions for which functional annotation was identified were marked in Figure 5. Effect of window size on numbers of positional hits per position. the hits were evaluated separately for each of windows 50, 70, 80 and 90, at six sequence positions selected to be representative of the types of poliovirus. the hits were evaluated separately for each of windows 50, 70, 80 and 90. for each of the six selected positions, the following information was extracted from the StralSV matrix output file. all PDB templates contributed to the profile at that position, the corresponding LGA_S score, the sequence identity (Seq ID), the number of (template) amino acids that matched the query, and the name of the corresponding amino acid of the template. StralSV analyzed sequence variability in structure context for poliovirus RdRp (PDB: 1ra6; [19] using minimum span length of 5, LGA_S cutoff 55%, and window_size/distance_cutoff combinations 50/2.5, 70/3.5, 80/4.0, and 90/4.0. we used StralSV to analyze sequence variability matrices and sequence profiles. Plots containing data extracted directly from the matrix and profiles files are shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5. DSSP output was simplified as follows: helix, comprising alpha helix (H), pi helix (I), and 3/10 helix (G); strand, comprising extended strand (E) or residue in isolated beta bridge (B). inset: structure model of poliovirus polymerase on which have been labeled the six positions highlighted in the main figure. red circles: window size 70; blue: 80; green: 90. the hits were evaluated separately for each of windows 50, 70, 80 and 90, at six sequence positions selected to be representative of the types of frequency variation (of qualified hits) over the length of the polymerase. the hits were evaluated separately for each of the windows 50, 70, 80 and 90, at six sequence positions selected to be representative of the types of frequency variation (of qualified hits) over the length of the polymerase. each of six positions along poliovirus RdRp RdRp DsPhage RT DNA pol1 Other Templates Position Window e.8.1.4 e.8.1.6 e.8.1.2 e.8.1.1 not e.8 with SCOP ID D238 w90 85 32 0 0 3 120 w80 85 32 0 0 0 119 w70 79 32 0 0 0 0 111 w50 e.8.1.4 RdRp RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase e.8.1.6 RT Reverse transcriptase e.8.1.1 DNApol1 DNA polymerase I Results Effects of parameter settings on capture of database structure fragments Numbers of positional hits (residues within spans) were plotted for window_size/distance_cutoff parameter pairs 70/3.5, 80/4.0, and 90/4.0. a polymerase \"baseline\" was observed along the entirety of the poliovirus chain. all polymerase baseline regions, with exception of region 410-461, were identifiable independently of window_size. lowering the window_size value to 70 resulted in the capture of many (> 900) structure fragments. we included window_size 50 in this analysis in order to determine what effect a very small (low stringency) window_size value might have on the structure-function diversity of qualified hits. hits were categorized into four families in the e.8.1 (DNA/RNA polymerases) superfamily. sequence variability was limited to N (94%) and H (6%) within family e.8.1.4, in which poliovirus RdRp is categorized. in general approximately 2/3 of the positional hits could be categorized using SCOP. amino-acid variabilities derived from positional hits at all six positions examined are summarized in additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Distributions of observed amino-acids are shown for all templates and grouped as within or outside of fold e.8. window_size 90 was significantly less sequence variability detected among the positional hits compared to window_size 80 (1 position). the most variable positions accounting for no more than 14 distinct amino acids. window_size 70 produced 79 positions, 80 produced 74, and 90 produced 79. most dominant amino-acid residues occurred within the same (narrow) positional hit frequency range regardless of window_size. 62 positions occurred in all three of these data sets. StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 2, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 5, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 7 illustrate how StralSV can be used to quantify and annotate sequence variability among structure fragments. fewer fragments are selected at window_size 90 than with smaller window_size values for those positions that are sensitive to window_ window_size (or distance_cutoff) parameter values will result in capture of more structure fragments. many of these will be from structures that are more distantly related in terms of their SCOP classification and the taxonomy of the organisms that they are from. window_size 90 produced a polymerase baseline in the C-terminal region. the positional hit frequency was highly sensitive to window_size. it appears that smaller segments of polio RdRp in this region resembled short segments in distantly related proteins. Detection of sequence motifs A-G was mapped to the positional hit frequency plot for window size 80. all categories of polymerase (RdRp, RdDp/RT, DdRp, DdDp, DdDp) are recognized to contain sequence motifs A-D. identification of motifs E, F, and G has been obscured by the greater diversity among sequences assigned to these structure motifs. StralSV algorithm is sufficiently sensitive to detect structurally or functionally conserved residues even when the parameters may not be perfectly tuned. more than 250 positional hits contributed to residue counts at positions D233 and D328 (window_size 80, Figure 5) StralSV identified the more broadly conserved residues within the functional set identified by FireStar. a main difference between the two approaches is that FireStar identifies functional residues involved in ligand binding. this is determined by FireStar to be associated with binding of cytidine-s-triphosphate and uridine-s-monophosphate. residue-residue correspondences can be used to evaluate pure sequence alignment methods. StralSV could also facilitate identification of structural motifs (local conformations) that have not been observed in PDB. fragments detected at different positions at window_size values less than 90. this showed a clear filtering of these positional hits as the window_size increased. window_size and distance_cutoff have an opposing relationship with respect to qualifying a hit. well-known sequence motifs A-G were mapped to the positional hit frequency plot for window size 80. all categories of polymerase (RdRp, RdDp/RT, DdRp, DdDp, DdDp) are recognized to contain sequence motifs A-D. identification of motifs E, F, and G has been obscured by the greater diversity among sequences assigned to these structure motifs. more than 250 positional hits contributed to residue counts at positions D233 and D328. aspartic acid occurred at close to 100% frequency at these positions. the structure fragments contributing to these data points comprise RdRps and dsRNA phage polymerases. StralSV identified N297 as a residue associated with binding of cytidine-s-triphosphate and uridine-s-monophosphate (sites 2 and 3) StralSV is not limited to identification of residues that have been associated with a binding site, but can be used to infer structure and/or functional significance. StralSV is a new algorithm for detecting closely related structure fragments from a structure database (PDB or user-defined) and quantifying residue frequency from tight local structure alignments. high-stringency parameter settings will filter out all but highly structurally similar fragments and will impose very tight local alignments.
