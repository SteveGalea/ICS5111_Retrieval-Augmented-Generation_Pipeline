{"summary": "the order Herpesvirales contains a large number of viruses that share genetic, structural, and biological properties. it is divided into three phylogenetically related families infecting a wide range of hosts. the alloherpesviridae family includes viruses that infect fish and amphibians. the first report of the use of mass spectrometry for determination of the structural proteome of a herpesvirus, Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (IcHV-1), has been published. it discusses the status of host cellular proteins found in the virion and the interest in acquiring quantitative data. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) fractionation followed by in-gel trypsin digestion of proteins and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) analysis of the peptides produced is one of the most commonly used strategies. different workflows were used for identification of the structural proteins. gel-based approach should be relativized because many proteins in herpesvirus samples appear as multimeric entities and/or isoforms. a third rational for using gel-based approaches is the higher capacity of sample loading. a total of 10\u201330 g of proteins are commonly loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel. multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MuDPIT) approaches (dashed lines) protein digestion takes place in solution as in shotgun analyses but the peptide separation is performed using two-dimensional chromatography. V Gel based (1D + 2D) Targeted Peptide mass fingerprint Loret et al. [22] 2008 HSV-1 Gel based Targeted LC MS/MS Dry et al. [24] 2009 CCV Gel free (2D) Untargeted LC MS/MS Michel et al. [26] 2011 PRV Gel based + Gel free (2D) Untargeted LC MS/MS L\u00e9t\u00e9 et al. sensitivity of modern mass spectrometers is higher than the limit of detection of common protein staining protocols. untargeted gel-based analysis is somewhat time-consuming because the complete gel needs to be analyzed rather than just the region in which proteins are detected by staining. the only other manuscript that compared gel-based and gel-free approaches was performed on Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1, also called pseudorabies virus) in this paper, shotgun proteomics (1D-LC MS/MS) was compared to gel-based analysis but in which no chromatographic separation was realized before MS analysis. in our lab, the gel-based approach that is only slightly more efficient than the gel-free approaches, double the time needed for the experiment to be conducted. extracellular virions are purified using centrifugation on density gradient. electron microscopy observation is usually performed to confirm the absence of cell-derived organelles or membrane debris. proteolysis of partially purified virions is often performed to remove contaminating proteins. the purity can also be validated by the absence of some nonstructural proteins (or parts of them) known to be nonstructural. a similar strategy was adopted by Loret et al. [22] who determined the high level of purity of their virus preparation from the absence of pre-VP22a, VP21 or full length UL26. the protease treatment did not affect gB, the envelope glycoprotein detected with the highest number of peptides, and more peptides were even observed for this protein in the proteinase K treated sample than in the control. proteolysis treatment could also erroneously consider a protein associated with the surface of the virion as a contaminant. gL was readily identified in untreated PRV and BoHV-4 virions. it was absent after proteinase K treatment, which could have incorrectly suggested that this protein was a contaminant. the only way to distinguish between contaminants and structural proteins is through immunogold labeling. this type of validation is rarely undertaken because it is a highly time-consuming procedure. the analysis of tegument proteins is of major importance in understanding the virion assembly process. the analysis of tegument proteins is clearly less straightforward than for the capsid because this structure cannot be purified. non-ionic detergents can be used to remove the envelope of the virion. the absence of gN in our analyses is therefore likely due to a detection failure by our mass spectrometry approach. a way to improve proteome coverage is to use multiple enzymes rather than trypsin, such that regions lacking the trypsin cleavage side are also accessible to MS identification. abundant glycosylation can lead to aggregation of glycoproteins into very large complexes, which cannot enter the gel. glycan moieties are generally highly heterogenic and proteins are present as several glycoforms distributed throughout the gel. this distribution results in a decrease in the effective concentration and thus can negatively influence both the detection and perceived abundance of the protein. phosphorylation of tegument protein ORF9p is important for virion production. only a few of the structural proteomes of herpesvirus published so far have reported the presence of phosphoproteins. consensus sequences for virion kinase could be identified. proteogenomics can be defined as the use of fragmentation spectra acquired in proteomics to improve genome annotation. several ORFs have been regarded as only putative coding sequences because no homology has been found with any known proteins at the time of genome sequencing. a study by Varnum et al. [15] highlighted six new short ORFs that were not predicted in the annotated genome of human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), also called human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) the authors also identified the product of two previously unannotated ORFs in the mouse cytomegalovirus structural proteome. structural proteomes of herpesviruses used the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) [70]. this measure takes into account the number of identified peptides and the number of theoretical detectable peptides. the correlation was rather low (never exceeding 0.42). a first level answer to this question is the degree of purity of the virions preparation, which needs to be as high as possible. some proteins could be intrinsically resistant to proteolysis due to examples from PTMs, conformation or polymerization. actin is a cross-linker between the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. it has been attributed to a function in an early stage of the infection of human herpesvirus 8. the role of these host proteins present in virions is still relatively unclear. to date, no dedicated workflow has been proposed to answer this question. only intracellular abundance of the host protein can give clues to its specific incorporation or not in virions. aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase + + + + + 5 Heat shock protein 90 + + + + + + 5 Rab (a) + + + + + 5 ADP ribosylation factors (a) + + + + 5 Caseine kinase + + + + 5 Histones (a) + + + + 3 Profilin + + + 3 Tubulin (a) + + + 3 Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta-like + + + 3 Pase the UL47 deletion also influences actin incorporation virions to a level even higher than observed for the UL49 deletion. this method even allowed determination that the UL47 deletion also had an effect on the isoform of pUL48 that was incorporated in the particles. development of more quantitative analyses in which this influence could be characterized in more detail and on more than a few strains. the ability to quantify structural proteomics would increase our understanding of these phenomena."}
