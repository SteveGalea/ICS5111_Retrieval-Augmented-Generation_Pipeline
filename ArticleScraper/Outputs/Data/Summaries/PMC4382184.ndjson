{"summary": "the placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to syncytin-1. syncytin-1 may be responsible for the heightened vulnerability. in placental mammals it comes with the inherent dilemma that the maternal immune system must tolerate the existence of the semi-allogenic foetus/placenta that expresses both self (maternal) and non-self (paternal) antigens[1]. it is also clear that to prevent maternal rejection of the foetus and to sustain a successful pregnancy, potent mechanisms of immune regulation must be activated. emergence of a new pandemic strain of swine influenza in 2009 refocussed attention on this issue. 50% of women who died were pregnant. this is a startling statistic that emphasises that pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infection with influenza and are also more likely to develop severe disease. twelve pregnant women (non-vaccinated) (PNV) and 10 healthy non-pregnant women (non-vaccinated) (NPNV) recruited from October 2012-October 2013. inclusion criteria for all participants were females of child-bearing age (18\u201340 years). women excluded if they had chronic medical illness, drug or alcohol dependence, currently smoking, if they had asthma or other respiratory conditions. Syncytin-1 recombinant ectodomain was cloned into the pET-28b vector (Novagen) using BspH1, Nco1 and Xho1 restriction enzymes. the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene) in 10 L of Luria Broth culture media (Sigma) and expression was induced with 1mM IPTG (Sigma) the protein stock was stored at-20\u00b0C at a concentration of 100 M in 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4. a 20 M working solution was prepared by diluting 1 volume of 100 M stock with 4 volumes of buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4) ELISA IFN-1 protein was measured from culture supernatants using a microplate reader. the samples were run on a BD FACS Canto II Flow Cytometer. antibodies used in the lymphocyte cytokine panel were: Fixable Viability Stain 450, CD45 BV510, CD56 BV605, CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5, FoxP3 PE, CD25 APC, CD8 AF700, CD3 APC-H7, IL-6 FITC, IFN- PE-Cy7 and GITR AF488. all samples were run on a BD FACS ARIA Flow Cytometer PBMCs were first cultured for 44hrs before adding a 1:10 dilution of the protein blocker, brefeldin A (BD Bioscience, CA, USA) after a total of 48 hours, PBMCs were centrifuged at 300xg for 10 minutes and resuspended in PBS buffer. PBMCs were stained for either the DC panel or the lymphocyte panel for cytokines or activation markers. IL-10, IL-6, IFN- and IFN- cytokine expression of each DC population was determined by plotting each and measuring the percentage of positive cells of the parent population. PBMCs were stained with CD4 for T helper cells, CD8 for cytotoxic T cells and FoxP3/CD25 for T regulatory cells. DCs positive for CD86, HLA-DR, CD80 and HLA-A, B, C, scatter plots were constructed for each marker against the CD123+ (pDC) or CD11c+ (mDC) population, gated on the parent population. Mean fluorescence intensity was also measured for each activation marker. a comparison was made between NPNV H1N1+Syncytin and media alone. a strain of 2009 pandemic swine flu was obtained from the world health organization (WHO Melbourne) in 2010. Syncytin-1 recombinant ectodomain was cloned into the pET-28b vector (Novagen) using BspH1, Nco1 and Xho1 restriction enzymes. the protein was extracted from the soluble cytoplasmic material using BugBuster Master Mix (Merck Millipore, Novagen) syncytin-1 stock was stored at-20\u00b0C at a concentration of 100 M in 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4. a 20 M working solution was prepared by diluting 1 volume of 100 M stock with 4 volumes of buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4) ELISA IFN-1 protein was measured from culture supernatants using a microplate reader. the samples were run on a BD FACS Canto II Flow Cytometer. antibodies used in lymphocyte cytokine panel were: Fixable Viability Stain 450, CD45 BV510, CD56 BV605, CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5, FoxP3 PE, CD25 APC, CD8 AF700, CD3 APC-H7, IL-6 FITC, IFN- PE-Cy7 and IL-10 PE-CF594. all samples were run on a BD FACS ARIA Flow Cytometer doublets and cell clumps were excluded at the same time as gating the PBMC population. a total of 5x105\u20131x106 events were then collected within these intersected gates. PBMCs were first cultured for 44hrs before adding a 1:10 dilution of the protein blocker, brefeldin A. mDC cells were considered the CD11c+ population while pDCs were considered the CD123+ from a CD123 vs CD11c scatter plot. IL-10, IL-6, IFN- and IFN- intracellular cytokine expression of each DC population was determined by plotting each and measuring the percentage of positive cells of the parent population. the lymphocyte panel employed followed the BD Bioscience Transcription factor buffer set manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the same gating strategy was followed as above. however, to determine the percentage of pDCs/mDCs positive for CD86, HLA-DR, CD80 and HLA-A, B, C, scatter plots were constructed for each marker against the CD123+ population. PBMCs from non-pregnant women showed a robust IFN response to H1N1pdm09 infection. syncytin alone was compared to media alone after 48hours of exposure. PBMCs from non-pregnant women showed a robust IFN- response. PBMCs from non-pregnant women were pre-exposed to syncytin-1 (1 M) PBMCs were infected with H1N1 MOI 0.1 for 48hrs. levels of IFN- (A), IFN- (B) and IFN- (C) in cell culture supernatants were measured by cytometric bead array (IFN- and IFN-) or ELISA (IFN-) the syncytin-1 preparation technique did not result in any endotoxin in the final protein. the multimeric peak corresponds to the bioactive conformation of the protein. the addition of syncytin-1 significantly reduced IFN- and IFN- responses (539 pg/mL, 95% CI 255\u2013823 pg/mL) PBMCs were infected with H1N1pdm09 MOI 0.1 for 48hrs with and without syncytin-1 (1 M) levels of IL-10 were measured in culture supernatants. NPNV = Non-pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 10, PNV = Pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 12. the pDC population was determined using CD3-/CD45+ cells. this population was analysed for cytokine release using intracellular staining. pDCs had increases in the percentage of IFN- positive cells in the presence of H1N1pdm09 compared to media. infection with H1N1pdm09 increased expression of HLA-DR and CD86. this expression was amplified with syncytin-1 pre-treatment. PBMCs from non-pregnant women treated with syncytin-1 have a heightened release. pdm09 MOI 0.1 for 48hrs with and without syncytin-1. NPNV = Non-pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 10, PNV = Pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 12. ANOVA (Holm-Sidak) **** P 0.0001, *** P 0.001, **P 0.01. PBMCs from pregnant and non-pregnant women showed a robust IFN- (14, PBMCs from non-pregnant women have robust IFN response to H1N1pdm09. PBMCs from non-pregnant women were pre-exposed to syncytin-1 (1 M) PBMCs were infected with H1N1 MOI 0.1 for 48hrs. 1M had the ability to reduce IFN- and IFN- and induce IL-10. syncytin-1 preparation technique did not result in any endotoxin in the protein. multimeric peak corresponds to the bioactive conformation of the protein. PBMCs from non-pregnant women treated with syncytin-1 have a heightened IL-10 response. levels of IL-10 were measured in culture supernatants by cytometric bead array. NPNV = Non-pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 10, PNV = Pregnant and non-vaccinated n = 12. the pDC population was determined using CD3-/CD45+ cells. this population was analysed for cytokine release using intracellular staining. surface staining of pDCs for activation markers HLA-DR and CD86 (D) was also measured. the majority of the IL-10 was from pDCs, but there was also a small amount expressed by CD4 TReg cells. infection with H1N1pdm09 increased expression of HLA-DR and CD86. this expression was amplified with syncytin-1 pre-treatment. PBMCs were infected with syncytin-1 for 48hrs with and without syncytin-1. levels of IL-1 (A) and IL-6 (B) were measured by ELISA and cytometric bead array. syncytin-1 impairs early innate immune responses to influenza. human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are derived from exogenous retroviruses. a HERV envelope gene belonging to the HERV-W family was first described in 1999. syncytin-1 was shown to fuse human cytotrophoblast cells and may be a key factor in regulating syncytialization during placental formation. exosomes isolated from placental explant tissue and maternal blood contained syncytin-1. isolated syncytin-1 modified maternal immune responses. syncytin-1 inhibited the release of tumour necrosis factor-, interferon- and CXCL-10 from whole blood following in-vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. pDCs from pregnant women showed higher expression of CD86 (P. 01), HLA-DR (P. 001) and negative regulator PDL1 (P. 001) compared with non-pregnant women. pDCs also showed reduced release of IFN-, IFN- and IL-2 in response to H1N1pdm09. a small number of CD4+ T cells were responsible for the release of IFN- in response to influenza and there was a trend to reduced release with syncytin-1. the pregnancy-associated susceptibility to intracellular pathogens has been classically attributed to a shift in helper T cell differentiation from a Th1 to the Th2-dominated response required for maintaining pregnancy. tin-1 led to a significant release of IL-10 from pDCs and to lesser extent TReg cells. increased IL-10 plays an important role in activating and maintaining TRegs[35] especially in local tissues. syncytin-1 has well described immunosuppressive effects on CD4+ cells, inducing anergy and a reduced ability to release cytokines. 63 hospitalised severe H1N1pdm09 patients to 53 individuals with seasonal influenza. evidence of hyper-activated pro-inflammatory response characterised by elevated IL-6 and suppressed adaptive Th1/Th17 response, with reduced CXCL-10, IFN and elevated IL-10. treatment of PBMCs with syncytin-1 alone was sufficient to increase release of IL-1 and IL-6. treatment of these monocytes with syncytin-1 was sufficient to trigger the inflammasome activation. syncytin-1 may impair antiviral interferon responses from monocytes and DCs. induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro on lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer and natural killer T cells. CKS-17 has been shown to inhibit the Th1 cytokines TNF-, IFN- and IL-2 along with an upregulation of IL-10. PBMCs from non-pregnant vaccinated (NPV) women were exposed to increasing doses of syncytin-1. levels of IFN- (a), IFN- (b) and IL-10 (c) were measured by cytometric bead array. PBMCs from a non-pregnant vaccinated (NPV) woman were infected with H1N1 of increasing doses for 48hrs. levels of IFN- (a) and IFN- (b) in cell culture supernatants were measured by cytometric bead array."}
