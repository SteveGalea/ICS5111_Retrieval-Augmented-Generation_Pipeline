{"summary": "study aims to establish reference values for selected hematology and serum clinical chemistry analyses that may contribute to research on shrew in future. hematology and serum clinical chemistry analyses are important indicators in health assessment of domestic animals and wildlife. shrew is native to india and Southeast Asia and widely distributed throughout Bangladesh. the shrew is also natural reservoir of several zoonotic pathogens (Hantavirus, Hepatitis E virus, Thottapalayam virus, Borna disease virus, plague, Toxoplasma gondii, etc.) animals were categorized into adult and juvenile based on their appearances described in PREDICT One Health Consortium. blood samples (1-2 mL/animal) were collected directly from the heart opportunistically. blood samples (1-2 mL/animal) were transferred into two tubes, one without anticoagulant. data were presented as mean, SD, minimum, and maximum with 90% CI. differences between the hematology and serum biochemistry parameters of male and female, adult and juvenile house shrews were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney test. blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and packed cell volume were estimated. red blood cells and white blood cells were manually estimated and counted. the comparative level of blood parameters and serum chemistry between males and females, adult and juveniles is shown in Table-1. shrews showed higher levels of PCV, total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, P, Na, Cl, and TP. adult shrews had higher levels of lymphocyte, urea, and glucose.
