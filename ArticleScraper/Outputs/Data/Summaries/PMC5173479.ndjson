{"summary": "a prospective multicentre surveillance study of infants less than 1 year of age admitted in 2009 with lower respiratory tract infection to all hospitals (5 regional, 4 tertiary) in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Nunavik. it is unknown whether this burden of disease of lower respiratory tract infections is comparable across the Canadian Arctic. length of stay decreased by 32.2% for every 30-day increase in age. syncytial virus was most common virus identified, and coinfection was associated with longer length of stay. study included 5 regional hospitals in Yellowknife, Churchill, Iqaluit, Puvirnituq and Kuujjuaq, and 4 tertiary hospitals in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Montreal. infants who require hospital admission are admitted to regional or tertiary hospitals. each hospital had a site investigator and a trained research nurse on site to prospectively identify infants who met the inclusion criterion. laboratory testing was performed at the regional Virology Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario by means of a viral multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel included respiratory syncytial virus and 19 other viruses. we used a nonparametric test to examine the difference in median admission age across regions. we calculated the annual incidence rate per 1000 live births of hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection. the denominator was the number of births in each region in 2009. the unit of analysis was the number of admissions. we included all infants less than 1 year of age residing in these regions who had been admitted with physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2009. questionnaire documented the use of palivizumab14 and underlying risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection including preterm birth (less than 36 weeks' gestational age), chronic lung disease, substantial congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, and congenital or neurologic conditions typically considered risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection. rhinovirus and enterovirus are indistinguishable by polymerase chain reaction. a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for influenza A was implemented. a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for influenza A was performed. rates of transfer to tertiary centres and severe lower respiratory tract infection were calculated per 1000 live births in each region and were compared across regions. we used multivariate multinomial logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between the number of viruses and long versus short length of stay. subregion p value for comparison between all regions* p value for comparison between all regions* p value for NWT v.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection remains one of the most important health issues in these regions. the rates of admission for respiratory syncytial virus infection in the Kitikmeot region and Nunavik continue to be among the highest globally. see www.cmajopen.ca/content/4/4/E615/suppl/DC1.
