{"summary": "noroviruses are non-enveloped viruses from the Caliciviridae family that cause gastroenteritis in a variety of mammals including humans. human norovirus (HuNoV) infections account for significant mortality in the developing world, and in the developed world norovirus outbreaks come with a substantial financial burden. utilizing MNV-1 as a model allows norovirus replication and host cell interactions to be studied in cell culture and in small animals. murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) has been characterized to manipulate cell cycle progression at the G1/S restriction point, often creating favorable conditions for viral replication. many viruses can subvert the host cell division in order to create an environment where viral propagation is preferred. expression of viral NS5 protein in cell culture induces accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase through a G1/S arrest in an analogous manner to MNV-1 infection. the effects of NS5 on the host cell cycle are independent of the known replication and translation activities attributed to NS5 (VPg) each forward primer added a GAAAT motif and a T7 promoter (underlined) to the 5\u2032 end of the insert for T7 RNA polymerase binding. Bold sequences indicate start (ATG) or stop (TTA) codons. plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue MRF\u2032 Escherichia coli cells. the NS5 variants sequences had alanine substitutions inserted at the tyrosine 26 and phenylalanine 123, named NS5(Y26A) and NS5(Y26A) respectively. plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue MRF\u2032 E. coli cells. cyclin A (H-432) (sc-751; Santa Cruz), actin (I-19) (sc-1616; Santa Cruz), GFP (ab6556; Abcam), MNV-1 anti-NS1-2 [13] and MNV-1 anti-NS5 [13] secondary antibodies used were 680RD donkey anti-goat IgG (926\u201368074; LI-COR) results were analyzed with either a Student\u2019s t-test or a one-way ANOVA. results were analyzed with either a Student\u2019s t-test or a one-way ANOVA. each protein quantification was first normalized against actin loading. each forward primer added a GAAAT motif and a T7 promoter (underlined) to the 5\u2032 end of the insert for T7 RNA polymerase binding. the expression constructs matched the MNV-1 NS1-2 and NS5 sequences except for the addition of a methionine codon at the 5\u2032 end of the NS5 coding sequence to facilitate translation. the NS5 variants sequences had alanine substitutions inserted at the tyrosine 26 and phenylalanine 123, named NS5(Y26A) and NS5(Y26A) respectively. plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue MRF\u2032 E. coli cells. secondary antibodies used were 680RD donkey anti-goat IgG (926\u201368074; LI-COR) and 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG (926\u201332213; LI-COR) secondary antibodies used were cyclin A (H-432) (sc-751; Santa Cruz), actin (I-19) (sc-751; Santa Cruz), GFP (ab6556; Abcam), MNV-1 anti-NS1-2 and MNV-1 anti- in vitro RNA synthesis Plasmids were linearized at the 3\u2032 end of viral genes with EcoRI (for NS1-2), AvaI (for NS5) or HindIII (for NS5(Y26A) and NS5(F123A) plasmids were synthesized from the linearized plasmids using the mMessage mMachine transcription kit (Ambion) secondary antibodies used were 680RD donkey anti-goat IgG (926\u201368074; LI-COR) and 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG (926\u201332213; LI-COR) cell cycle analysis Synchronization of cells To synchronize cells to the G1 phase, approximately 2 106 cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks. Western blots are shown for one of three independent experiments. each protein quantification was first normalized against actin loading. each protein quantification was first normalized against actin loading. expression of NS5 induces a G0/G1 phase arrest MNV-1 infection of RAW-Blue cells induces an arrest at the G1/S restriction point, increasing the G0/G1 population. the NS5 protein from caliciviruses is essential to viral RNA transcription and translation and is essential for calicivirus replication. Approximately 1 106 RAW-Blue cells were transfected with 4\u20136 g of NS1-2 or NS5 RNA transcripts. NS5 inhibits cyclin A expression and induces an arrest at the G1/S restriction point. NS1-2 and NS5 coding RNA were synchronized to the G1 phase. NS1-2 was used as a viral control protein that did not affect the cell cycle. NS1-2 was added to released populations and used as a non-viral RNA negative control. cells were washed 3 times with 5 ml of complete medium and incubated for 5 h. after incubation, cells were recovered, counted and approximately 1 106 cells transfected with 4\u20136 g of GFP, NS1-2 or NS5 RNA transcripts. expression of NS5 inhibited the accumulation of cyclin A in populations progressing from G1 to S phase. cyclin A levels remained below detectable limits post-release as cells entered S phase. NS5 association with host eukaryotic initiation factors does not influence NS5 induced cell cycle arrest. RNA transcripts encoding NS5, NS5(F123A) and NS1-2 were generated. expression of viral NS1-2 had no effect on the host cell cycle. expression of both NS5 and NS5(F123A) variant increased the G0/G1 population by 22% and decreased the S phase population proportionally. expression of NS1-2, WT NS5, NS5(F123A) and Cyclin A was determined by Western blot analysis. actin was used as a loading control. NS5 nucleotidylation to RNA via Y26 plays no role in inducing host cell cycle effects. RNA encoding WT NS5, NS5(Y26A) and NS1-2 were synthesized. expression of viral NS1-2 had no effect on the host cell cycle. both NS5 and NS5(Y26A) expression increased the G0/G1 population by 20% and decreased the S phase population proportionally. expression of NS1-2, WT NS5, NS5(Y26A) and cyclin A was determined by Western blot analysis. actin was used as a loading control. NS1-2 and NS5 were detected by their corresponding antibodies 18 h posttransfection. of NS5 increased the population of cells in the G0/G1 phase by 28%. NS5 expression decreased cyclin A expression by 68% compared to the mock-transfected population. NS1-2 had no significant effects on the host cell cycle or cyclin A expression. NS5 inhibits cyclin A expression and induces an arrest at the G1/S restriction point. the transition through G1/S is a highly regulated checkpoint during cell division. it is often targeted by viruses to induce changes to the host cell cycle. transfection of NS5 RNA induced a G1/S phase arrest. at 24 hours post-release in NS5 transfected populations, 73% of cells remained in the G0/G1 phase compared to 46% in the mock-transfected population. cells were harvested at the indicated h.p.r. for Western blot analysis of cyclin A and actin expression. expression of NS5 inhibited the accumulation of cyclin A in populations progressing from G1 to S phase. the eukaryotic initiation factor binding domain of NS5 does not play a role in its cell cycle manipulation. the eukaryotic initiation factor binding domain of NS5 does not play a role in its cell cycle manipulation. the eukaryotic initiation factor binding domain of NS5 does not play a role in its cell cycle manipulation. mock-transfected (MT) cells were seeded at the time of transfection (negative control) cells were collected 18 hours posttransfection for FACS analysis. the histograms from (A) were analysed with MODfit LT 3.0. 26 residue with an alanine residue NS5(Y26A) prevents the formation of NS5-viral RNA. the nucleotidylation of NS5 at Y26 is likely contingent upon viral RNA polymerase (NS7). NS5 and NS5(Y26A) could be detected by the -NS5 antibody. cells were transfected with 4\u20136 g of NS1-2, WT NS5 and NS5(Y26A) RNA transcripts. a mock-transfected (MT) control was seeded at the time of transfection. the data are from one of three experiments. expression of NS5 alone was sufficient to induce accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduce cyclin A expression in an asynchronous population. further confirmation of NS5 as the cell cycle regulator comes from analyzing the ability of NS5 to inhibit the G1/S transition and prevent cyclin A accumulating in a population progressing from G1 into S phase. the NS5(Y26A) protein is unable to undergo the nucleotidylation reaction that attaches NS5 to viral RNA but still induced cell cycle changes. this indicates that attachment to RNA via the Y26 residue is not the cause of cell cycle affects."}
