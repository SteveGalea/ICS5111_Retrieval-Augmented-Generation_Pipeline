{"summary": "bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is the principal silkworm pathogen. resistance is controlled by major dominant genes and multiple genes of micro-effect. arginine kinase was found to be involved in the antiviral process. the molecular mechanisms of silkworm resistance against exogenous pathogens are still not fully elucidated. the molecular mechanisms of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection are still not fully elucidated. in silkworms during BmNPV infection, we selected near-isogenic line BC9 and recurrent parent P50 for transcriptome sequencing. a total of 869 DEGs were obtained, which included many genes potentially related to BmNPV-resistance. NPV occlusion bodies (OB) began fast proliferation at approximately 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) this time was considered optimal for sample collection. thirty larvae midguts were mixed together to minimize individual genetic differences. PCR amplification and RNA-Seq were performed by Beijing BioMarker Technologies (Beijing, China) the standard Illumina methods and protocols were adopted to prepare and sequence the cDNA libraries. the cDNA library was constructed using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB, USA) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB, USA) gene ontology (GO) annotations were obtained using the Blast2GO program. all searches were performed with an E-value 105.

V-ATPase is activated by LPH to promote viral entry into the cytoplasm. the released nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus with the help of EFP. EFHP, ASGPA, ALT2, U2AF, ACT5 and ZRDP play an important role in facilitating virus replication. increased number of genes with altered expression levels in BC9 may be related to BmNPV infection. protein metabolism, cytoskeleton, and apoptosis may play an important role in host response to BmNPV. cytochrome c, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, amyloid precursor protein and B-cell lymphoma protein 2 found to be of interest. inhibition of these genes may impair viral infectivity and virus-induced apoptosis. the relationship between immune genes and BmNPV remains unclear. many genes of interest were down-regulated in BC9 following BmNPV infection. expression level of these genes was all down-regulated in BC9. expression levels of EFHP and PAP were down-regulated in both BC9 and A35 following BmNPV infection. down-regulation of virus transport-related genes could inhibit transmembrane and intracellular transport of BmNPV thereby preventing further infection. protease inhibitor 6 is a member of the protein superfamily that contains apoptosis-inducing agents. peptidoglycan-recognition protein 2, hemolin, facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1, integument esterase 2, defense protein precursor, and antimicrobial protein 6Tox precursor also showed differential expression following BmNPV infection. the 22 DEGs discussed above played a role in the process of host response to BmNPV infection. the endocytosis process is triggered when the BmNPV nucleocapsid containing envelope binds to the cytomembrane. vacuolar ATP synthase is activated by LPH to promote the fusion of the envelope and endosome thereby releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. apoptosis process could be triggered by PDK to inhibit BmNPV infection. genes differentially expressed in P50+ vs. P50-, BC9+ vs. BC9- and BC9- vs. P50-."}
