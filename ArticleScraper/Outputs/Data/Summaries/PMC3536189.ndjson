{"summary": "in immunocompromised patients, RSV may cause severe illness with prolonged virus shedding. progression of RSV infection from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to LRTI is associated with an increased risk of death in these patients (7). the hematology unit of the Heidelberg University Hospital comprises four wards on two floors with 62 patient beds. the major focus of this unit is autologous and allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all patients in the unit. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were available from patients with pneumonia. a previously infected patient was considered to have cleared the infection when he/she was asymptomatic. for a subset of 47 patients out of 57 RSV-infected patients, enough sample material was available for phylogenetic analysis. extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers. the second variable region of the G gene was amplified from cDNA using primers as described previously (18). sporadic cases of RSV-infected patients were detected in early January. in early January the number of RSV-positive patients increased substantially in this unit. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all patients in the unit. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were available from patients with pneumonia. all inpatients and medical personnel were screened for RSV. all frozen stored respiratory specimens from July to December 2011 were retrospectively subjected to RSV analysis. RNA was extracted from respiratory specimens using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) representative reference sequences from RSV A and RSV B genotypes were obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) 13 of 61 (21.3%) patients tested RSV positive, while only 1 staff member out of 209 (0.5%) tested positive for RSV subtype A. peak of outbreak was seen in week 2 of January 2012, with 13 newly diagnosed RSV-infected patients. a mixture of RSV A outbreak strain, RSV A nonoutbreak strains, and RSV B strains in the hematology unit was observed. the hospital outbreak was already contained in early February, while further observed RSV infections between week 7 and 10 corresponded with new introductions of RSV strains circulating in the community at that time. a sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree were established. forty-one out of 47 patients displayed an identical RSV genotype GA2 sequence. strains from patients P41, P42, and P47 and pediatric cases C22, C27, and C29 belonged to the RSV B BA IV genotype. sequences are grouped by RSV A and RSV B sequences. dots indicate nucleotide identities, and dashes are used for adjustment of nucleotide insertions. three patients (P12, P23, and P40) were lost to follow-up for prolonged viral shedding analysis. six patients died while still shedding RSV at time of death. 26 of 35 long-term shedding patients cleared viral infection. 13 of 61 (21.3%) patients tested RSV positive. only 1 staff member out of 209 (0.5%) tested positive for RSV subtype A. peak of the outbreak was seen in week 2 of January 2012. of 121 RSV-positive samples, subtype-specific PCR assays revealed 80 RSV subtype A (66%) and 41 RSV subtype B (34%) samples. the hospital outbreak was already contained in early February. further observed RSV infections between week 7 and 10 corresponded with new introduction of RSV strains circulating in the community at that time. forty-one out of 47 patients (P1 to P39, P43, and P44) and 4 pediatric community patients (C1, C2, C9, and C16) displayed an identical RSV genotype GA2 sequence (RSV A outbreak strain) strains from patients P41, P42, and P45 were also genotyped as RSV GA2 but were different from the outbreak strain. reference sequences for RSV A and RSV B genotypes selected from GenBank are indicated by their accession numbers. the bar indicates 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. three patients (P12, P23, and P40) were lost to follow-up. six patients (P4, P5, P9, P10, P38, and P41) died while still shedding RSV. 26 of 35 (74%) long-term shedding patients cleared viral infection. the outbreak strain accounted for all patients until week 5 in 2012. it appears unlikely the infections within the unit could have occurred by independent introductions of transmission from the community. the winter of 2011/2012 was predicted as a late, weak RSV season. ourocomial RSV outbreak among hematology patients with nine infected patients had been reported previously. eight of these patients revealed an identical RSV strain. a broader screening for respiratory pathogens in immunocompromised patients is recommended. two or more independent samples were sequenced and revealed identical sequences. the second wave was characterized by a mixture of RSV A outbreak strain, RSV A nonoutbreak strain, and RSV B strains. the difference between groups A and B in clinical severity has been discussed. complete viral clearance was correlated with lymphocyte reconstitution irrespective of receipt of antiviral medication. twenty of 35 patients with prolonged viral shedding were transplant patients, 8 patients with autologous and 12 patients with allogeneic transplants. there was no obvious difference in viral shedding between the outbreak strain itself and strains of the community-acquired cases. a low index of suspicion delayed the discovery of the responsible agent. prolonged viral shedding could have contributed to the outbreak."}
