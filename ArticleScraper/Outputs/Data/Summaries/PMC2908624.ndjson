{"summary": "protection against life-threatening infections is a major function of the immune system. innate immune responses critically impinge on the development of pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. pDCs are a CD11clow DC subset that is characterized by phenotypic markers and special functional properties. in systemic MHV infection, spleen and liver represent major target organs [8], and primarily hematopoietic cell-derived type I IFN controls viral replication and virus-induced liver disease [9]. pDCs respond most efficiently to the pDC-derived type I IFN and thus secure containment of MHV within SLOs [10]. the operation of the spleen might switch from a \u2018virus sink\u2019 to a \u2018virus source\u2019 mode. this bi-modal function, i.e. the ability of the spleen to either eliminate or disseminate the virus, is outlined in Figure 1B. this bi-modal function depends on the number of pDCs in spleen, their activation status, the dose of infection, and the kinetics of virus spread. 'elementary', well-documented processes such as the virus replication, target cell turnover and IFN- decay. this allowed us to estimate the individual decay rates, the virus-target cell interaction parameters and the protective effect of IFN-. the data set characterizes the response of pDCs infection with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 1) the average secretion rate of infected pDCs is 4.4*104 pg h1. the average secretion rate of IFN- per infected pDC is 4.4*104 pg h1. the latter estimate takes into account that the molecular weight of IFN- is about 17000 atomic mass units. the data on the amount of secreted IFN- were used to validate the calibrated model (green circles). best-fit parameter values for in vitro and in vivo MHV infection of pDC and M and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. kCV (1/h) 0.2 & 0.087 [0.015, 6.0] & [0.029, 0.19] 0.049 & 0.057 [0.024, 0.11] & [0.012, 0.11] experimental data sets were generated using broad spectrum of IFN treatment conditions [10], [13] 106 molecules h1) compared to pDCs and Ms compared to pDCs. the calibrated modules allowed to proceed with the modeling of early kinetics of MHV growth and the IFN response in vivo. a reference data set characterizing the MHV growth in spleen, blood and liver and serum ALT kinetics after intravenous (i.v.) infection with 5103 pfu and 5105 pfu was used. we integrated the description of MHV infection in spleen with virus compartmental dynamics in the liver and blood to formulate the systemic model of MHV infection. a minimal set of three parameters ensured a consistent fitting of the in vivo data. the infection rate (reduced by 60-fold), the 50% inhibition threshold (increased by 10-fold) and the IFN secretion rate (reduced by 3 fold) for Ms. the stepwise developed mathematical model, comprised of calibrated, refined and validated elementary modules, tightly fits the observed kinetics of MHV infection. pDC numbers and activation status on early antiviral protection. decrease of pDC population in spleen by 10-fold results in increased virus titers. but further depletion of pDCs leads to overwhelming virus growth. pDCs in spleen depend on the number of pDCs and the dose of infection. a further decrease of the pDC population breaks their ability to keep the number of infected Ms below 10%. we modeled the situation when a certain fraction of infected Ms is pre-activated at the start of the infection. the protection unit of pDCs required to prevent severe disease after low dose infection is around 7103 pfu. the reduction in the total number of non-activated splenic pDCs strongly affects the severity of disease. however, rather modest pre-activation of as few as 200 pDCs leads to a reduction of peak ALT below the threshold of severe disease. spleen preserves its sink function as long as the pDC population is above 104 cells. spleen preserves its sink function as long as the pDC population is above 104 cells. the spleen is well-protected, i.e. the peak virus titer stays below 105 pfu/ml. however, once the IFN secretion rate is reduced by 100-fold, the virus infection is out of control. the severity of disease, characterized by the peak ALT levels, depends on the dose of infection and the IFN secretion rate by pDCs in spleen. disease severity determined as ALT levels in serum at 48 h post infection (i.v. infection with indicated doses) depending on the relative reduction rate of IFN secretion rate by pDCs. pDCs in spleen provide very limited protection against severe disease for faster replicating strains of the virus. splenic pDCs protect against severe disease for up to 30-fold increase in the viral replication rate in spleen. pDCs provide a robust protection against severe disease when the virulence-enhancing mutation leads to faster replication only in target cells located in spleen. the spleen represents a robust sink system able to cope with substantially enhanced virus production. the MHV-pDC interaction parameters appearing in the basic model of the type I IFN response were estimated by fitting simultaneously the data sets on wt and ifnar / cells. the maximum likelihood approach was used to quantify the model parameters with the best-fit description of the data by the model shown in Figure 2A and 2B. experimental data (open symbols) represent the geometric mean SEM. in vitro MHV infection of pDCs (MOI = 1). Fraction of infected cells in the population of live cells is shown in blue. experimental data sets were generated using broad spectrum of IFN treatment conditions [10], [13] to identify the parameters of MHV infection and type I IFN-mediated protection of Ms. the experimental data for MHV infection kinetics (MOI = 1) in wt Ms and after IFN treatment are in close agreement with the model prediction. the essential parameters suggest that (i) MHV production by a single M is with 37 pfu h1 much larger than that of pDCs, (ii) the concentration of IFN- required for 2-fold inhibition of MHV production is about 0.1 pg/ml, and (iii) the per o, we modeled the infections of the mixture of the above numbers of pDCs and Ms with increasing virus doses (5101, 5103, 5105 pfu) the model consistently predicts that the virus growth is robustly controlled and that the extent of the activation of the type I IFN response depends on the virus kinetics. the morphology of spleen is drastically different from the in vitro cell suspensions. the second factor is the spatial location of Ms versus pDCs in spleen. the number of Ms in spleen is about 10-fold larger than the pDC population. the mathematical model integrates the detailed virus-target cell kinetics and IFN response in spleen with compartmental virus dynamics in blood and liver. pDC numbers and activation status on early antiviral protection. the decrease of the pDC population in spleen by 10-fold results in increased virus titers. however, further depletion of pDCs leads to an overwhelming virus growth. however, further depletion of pDCs leads to an overwhelming virus growth. d pDCs suffice to protect 6106 Ms, which leads to the estimate of M per pDC. we evaluated the peak ALT level for i.v. infections with different MHV doses. the host is protected against infection with physiological doses when the number of pDCs in spleen is unchanged (7105) or 10-fold reduced. spleen preserves its sink function as long as the pDC population is above 104 cells. effects of IFN secretion and virus growth rates Viruses have evolved various mechanisms to reduce the efficacy of innate immune mechanisms. reduced IFN production by pDCs has a stronger impact on virus kinetics in spleen. reduced IFN production by pDCs has a stronger impact on virus kinetics in spleen. but leads to minor perturbations of virus growth in the liver. pfu even when the IFN secretion rate drops down to 1% of its normal value. we used the mathematical model of MHV infection to evaluate the limits of protection against severe disease for increasing virus replication rates. pDCs in spleen provide very limited protection against severe disease. only a 15% increase in the growth rate of MHV in the liver leads to infection with ALT levels rising to 103 IU/L within two days. the decrease of pDC numbers in spleen makes the situation more fragile. pDCs are not only specialized for immediate viral recognition and type I IFN production through TLR-7 and -9 expression and the constitutive expression of IRF-7 [5], they probably also exhibit unique counter-measures against viral IFN inhibitors. the interplay between pDCs and Ms is thus a critical cellular axis for the preservation of SLO integrity during early cytopathic virus infection. the robust sink function of the spleen is guaranteed by the high protective capacity of single pDCs which protect 103 to 104 Ms from cytopathic viral infection. the minimal protective unit of pre-activated pDCs in spleen is around 200 cells which can rescue the host from severe disease. the combined combination of experimental studies and mathematical modeling may be used to further explore the contribution of virus-encoded factors modulating tumor necrosis factor-enhanced liver inflammation [30] or the role of important host factors such as the prothrombinase Fgl2/fibroleukin which critically regulate virus-induced liver disease [31]. the last decade of research in immunology is characterized by a tremendous advance in the high-throughput experimental technologies yielding detailed information on the system state at various levels of antiviral compounds directed against cytopathic viruses should target viral spread within non-lymphoid target organs. pDCs were obtained from spleens of B6 mice following digestion with collagenase type II as described previously. the persistence of virus and type I IFN in medium displays an exponential kinetics. the corresponding decay rate constants for MHV (dV) and IFN (dI) were estimated by a linear regression procedure using GraphPad Prism v.4 software. we evaluated for the models the Akaike criterion of the information loss (AIC), defined as [46], and the model description length [47] from where nd is the total number of scalar observations, L is the number of optimized parameters, and are the best-fit least-squares function. the value was 19.5 versus 22.1 for the Gompertz model. the delay and decay rate determine the IFN- concentration dynamics. the loss of IFN- due to interaction with the target cell receptors is neglected. the per capita death rate is either constant, or depends on time according to gompertz law. the severity of the virus-induced liver disease is characterized by the liver enzyme ALT concentration in serum. the second term takes into account that there is some homeostatic turnover of ALT in serum with the decay rate. the influx-elimination processes are described by the homeostasis terms. the equation for virus in spleen considers the virus transfer between spleen and blood. the subset of equations for virus dynamics in blood, liver and serum ALT level remains the same as equations (6)\u2013(8). the parameter estimation was carried out using either MATLAB 7.0 routines (http://www.mathworks.com) or Absoft Pro Fortran Developer (http://www.absoft.com) and IMSL function minimization code ZXMIN based on a quasi-Newton method. the number of reliably identifiable parameters in the mathematical models is limited by the amount and quality of the corresponding sets of experimental data. the identifiability test of the compartmental model (equations 5\u20138) suggests that it is identifiable. the observable variables are the virus in spleen, blood and liver and the serum ALT blood. a global sensitivity analysis was performed which allowed to rank the influence of random variations in the model parameters on the variation in the serum ALT level. the persistence of virus and type I IFN in medium displays an exponential kinetics. the corresponding decay rate constants for MHV (dV) and IFN (dI) were estimated using GraphPad Prism v.4 software. the best-fit estimates for the death rate parameters for pDCs and Ms are given in the Table S1. we evaluated for the models the Akaike criterion of the information loss (AIC), defined as [46], and the model description length [47] from where nd is the total number of scalar observations, L is the number of optimized parameters. the rate of change of the number of infected target cells is modeled by the following equation (3) The first term in the right-hand side describes the emergence of the infected cells due to the virus infection of uninfected target cells. the second one accounts for the death of infected cells. the severity of the virus-induced liver disease is characterized by the liver enzyme ALT concentration in serum. the second term takes into account that there is some homeostatic turnover of ALT in serum with the decay rate. the influx-elimination processes are described by the homeostasis terms. the equation for virus in spleen considers the virus transfer between spleen and blood. the subset of equations for virus dynamics in blood, liver and serum ALT level remains the same as equations (6)\u2013(8). the parameter estimation was carried out using either MATLAB 7.0 routines (http://www.mathworks.com) or Absoft Pro Fortran Developer (http://www.absoft.com) and IMSL function minimization code ZXMIN based on a quasi-Newton method. the method is based upon elimination of unobserved state variable from the original system of equations to obtain the identification equation. the identifiability test of the compartmental model (equations 5\u20138) suggests that it is identifiable, provided that the observable variables are the virus in spleen, blood and liver and the serum ALT blood, which is the current case. the measurements of the virus titer (circles) observed at 12 and 24 hours after MHV infection of 105 macrophages are depicted. the effect of pDCs derived supernatant on MHV replication was measured in wt macrophages pre-treated with the indicated amounts of IFN-containing supernatant.
