{"summary": "this study aims to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the global activity within this rapidly developing field. we used the key terms \u201cmicrobiome-gut-brain axis\u201d and its synonyms because we are concerned with MGBA per se as new concept in research rather than related topics. work on MGBA focused on immunomodulation, irritable bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders. many issues remain about their relevance for therapeutic intervention of many diseases."}
