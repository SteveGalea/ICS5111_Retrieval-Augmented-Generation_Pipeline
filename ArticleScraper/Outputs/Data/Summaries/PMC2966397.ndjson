{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome of 27\u201331 kb. coVs are divided into three genera [2] alpha- and beta- and gamma-coronaviruses. gamma-coronaviruses genera is formed by Avian infectious bronchitis virus. molecular genetic data showed that the causative agent of SARS most likely originated from recombination events between mammalian-like and avian-like parental viruses present in wild animal species [18] surveillance for possible animal reservoirs of CoVs has gained importance in the research community. wild bird species are reservoirs for a number of emerging viruses, including avian influenza A virus. 64 of the 1,002 faecal and cloacal samples were positive (6.4%) positives were found in 18 species. we classified the species into six different groups that reflect their taxonomy and their ecology. the lowest rates were observed on Commander (2.3%) and Wrangel Islands (3.5%); Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was at the mid-point (8.2%), and the highest rates were detected at Point Barrow (11%) and Kolyushin (27.5%). however, the sampled avifauna also differed among sites (2 = 1754.7, df = 20, p0.001) cescens 2 148 1.4 Larus vegae 2 36 5.6 Larus hyperboreus 1 11 9.1 Rissa brevirostris - 65 0 Rissa tridactyla - 1 0 Auks 2 Species Fratercula cirrhata - 101 0 Cepphus columba 1 27 3.7 Pelacaniformes Seabirds 3 Species Phalacrocorax sp 1 trees constructed using neighbour-joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods showed similar topologies. all of the viruses found in this study belonged to gamma-coronaviruses and were most closely related to IBV strains. cluster A contained eight Alaskan and one Russian virus, and the within-group distance ranged between 0.8\u201316%. the trees also revealed clustering of strains based on geographic location and host species. two clusters were identified within the gamma-coronaviruses branch. cluster A contained eight Alaskan and one Russian virus. the within-group distance ranged between 0.8-16%. none of the 101 examined tufted puffins were CoV positive. the lowest rates were observed on Commander (2.3%) and Wrangel Islands. the highest rates were detected at Point Barrow (11%) and Kolyushin (27.5%) ollis 7 75 9.3 Eurynorhynchus pygmeus 1 1 100 Calidris mauri 5 23 21.7 Calidris alpina 1 5 20.0 Calidris pusilla 1 5 20.0 Arenaria interpres - 1 0 Gulls 6 Species Larus ridibundus 5 61 8.2 Larus glaucescens 2 148 1.4 Larus vegae 2 36 5.6 Larus hyperbor trees constructed using neighbour-joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods showed similar topologies. all of the viruses found in this study belonged to gamma-coronaviruses and were most closely related to IBV strains. cluster A contained eight Alaskan and one Russian virus and the within-group distance ranged between 0.8\u201316%. gamma-coronaviruses were detected in 6.4% of the examined wild bird samples. the gamma-coronaviruses contains both avian CoVs and CoVs isolated from beluga and Asian leopard cats. gamma-coronaviruses are widespread among birds associated with water environments. most of the birds sampled in this study are migratory and leave Beringia when conditions deteriorate in the autumn. the gamma-coronaviruses were genetically diverse within the examined genomic region. all the viruses were phylogenetically close to various IBV strains, and all belonged to gamma-coronavirusa. some support for the latter notion comes from the three gamma-coronaviruses. 1,002 samples were collected from five geographic areas within the Bering Strait. the samples represented 26 different bird species, three bird orders and six bird families. the samples were collected either with a sterile cotton swab from the cloacae of trapped birds. anatidae 6 355 Charadriiformes Scolopacidae 9 339 Laridea 6 113 Alcidae 2 128 Pelacaniformes Phalacrocoracidae 2 66 Procellariidae 1 1 Total:3 6 26 1002 Detection of coronavirus by RT-PCR Virions were lysed by mixing a 150-l sample with 450 l TRIzol. nucle the cDNA samples were used to amplify a 608-610-bp stretch in the polymerase gene using degenerate primers. the forward primer was used as previously published by Woo et al. [9] with slight modifications. based neighbour-joining and character based maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were generated using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software v.4.0. other models were tested that showed similar topologies. cDNA synthesis and sequencing cDNA was synthesized from RNA from all of the pan-CoV RT-PCR positive samples in 50-l reactions with l0 l of RNA. cDNA synthesis was performed on a Cycler IQTM PCR-cycler at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 37\u00b0C for 90 min and 70\u00b0C for. the 50-l reactions contained 1 AffinityScript buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), 10 mM DTT (Promega, Madison, WI), 800 ng random hexamers and 50 U AffinityScript reverse transcriptase. the cDNA samples were used to amplify a 608-610-bp stretch in the polymerase gene using degenerate primers. distance based neighbour-joining and character based maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were generated using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software v.4.0."}
