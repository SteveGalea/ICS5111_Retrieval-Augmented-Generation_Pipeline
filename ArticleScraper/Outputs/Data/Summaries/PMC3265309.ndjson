{"summary": "the genome includes at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. the nucleocapsid protein (N) is enclosed in an envelope containing at least three virally-encoded membrane proteins. some coronaviruses have an additional membrane glycoprotein, hemagglutinin esterase. the paper focuses on feline and canine coronaviruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus. the canine respiratory coronavirus, which belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, has been separated into three new genera. each genus is subdivided into different species on the basis of sequence identity in the replicase domain pp1ab. the authors proposed to group the ferret and mink coronaviruses in a new alphacoronavirus species (alphacoronavirus 2) within the Alphacoronavirus genus [16]. the authors proposed to group the ferret and mink coronaviruses within the alphacoronavirus genus [16]. FCoV and CCoV Genotypes FCoV and CCoV are classified into 2 main genotypes. feline sequences are coloured in blue, canine sequences in orange, and porcine sequences in purple. Arrows indicate putative sites of recombinations. type II FCoVs originate from a double recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV, resulting in a genome principally composed of FCoV sequences but with the S gene and its adjacent sequences originating from CCoV [19\u201322]. FCoV is highly prevalent in catteries, where up to 80% of the animals are seropositive, while in households 10 to 50% of the cats are infected [23]. ORF3 encodes a 28 kDa N-glycosylated protein with a cleavable N-terminal signal. it has been proposed that type I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common ancestor. CCoV-I may have acquired the ORF3 gene after the divergence of FCoV-I, or, alternatively, FCoV-I may have lost the ORF3 gene present in their common ancestor. virulent strains cause feline infectious peritonitis and are called feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) virulent strains cause feline infectious peritonitis and are called feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV) lesions affecting several organs resemble those described in cats with the dry form of FIP. both canine genotypes have been associated with enteric CCoV. pantropic CCoVs identified so far belong to the CCoV-IIa genetic cluster. a transient reduction in T and B cell populations is observed during the first week after infection. the CD4+ T cell population remains depleted for 30 days postinfection, which could cause dysfunction of the immune system and favour opportunistic infections. each genus is subdivided into different species on the basis of sequence identity in the replicase domain of the polyprotein pp1ab. alphacoronavirus 2 is a new alphacoronavirus species (alphacoronavirus 2) in the genus [16]. the ferret and mink coronaviruses are grouped in a new alphacoronavirus species (alphacoronavirus 2) within the Alphacoronavirus genus [16]. FCoV and CCoV Genotypes FCoV and CCoV strains are classified into 2 main genotypes. feline sequences are coloured in blue, canine sequences in orange, and porcine sequences in purple. Arrows indicate putative sites of recombinations. a double recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV resulted in a genome principally composed of FCoV sequences but with the S gene and its adjacent sequences originating from CCoV [19\u201322]. FCoV is highly prevalent in catteries, where up to 80% of the animals are seropositive, while in households 10 to 50% of the cats are infected [24\u201327]. kDa N-glycosylated protein with a cleavable N-terminal signal is unknown. it has been proposed that type I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common ancestor. CCoV-I may have acquired the ORF3 gene after the divergence of FCoV-I. the acquisition of a new S gene led to the emergence of CCoV-II. the CCoV-IIb subtype was detected in 20% of the CCoV-IIb infections. virulent strains cause feline infectious peritonitis and are called feline infectious peritonitis viruses. virulent biotypes are classified according to their virulence. both canine genotypes have been associated with enteric CCoV. pantropic CCoVs identified so far belong to the CCoV-IIa genetic cluster. clinical signs are moderate by comparison with those in seronegative dogs. a transient reduction in T and B cell populations is observed during the first week after infection. the CD4+ T cell population remains depleted for 30 days postinfection. apoptosis may be responsible for pathology induced by CCoV infection. ism of pantropic coronavirus remains unclear. infected macrophages may also support viral replication. a similar furin cleavage motif has been found in the thymus. RR has been recognized in the FCoV strains UCD and UCD8 and in the CCoV-I strain Elmo/02. the cellular receptor identified for the alphacoronavirus 1 species is the aminopeptidase N protein (APN or CD13) type-I and -II FCoVs can use DC-SIGN as a co-receptor for cellular entry. the role of lectins in the entry of CCoVs has not been studied so far. the role of lectins in the entry of CCoVs has not been studied. replicase-transcriptase proteins are encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b. they are initially synthesized as two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. these polyproteins are processed by two or three viral proteases to generate 16 end products. this promotes genome replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. FECV is mainly confined to the intestine and presumed to replicate in enterocytes. it is believed that the capacity of an FCoV strain to replicate in monocyte-macrophage cells is correlated with its virulence. the viral cycle is less productive than with FECV. the target cells of ferret coronaviruses are probably the same as those of FCoVs and CCoVs. attachment to the cellular receptor is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the S protein. fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes is mediated by the C-terminal domain. chimeric viruses carry either a type I or a type II spike. chimeric viruses carry either a type I or a type II spike. it is tempting to speculate that CCoV-I uses the same unknown receptor. the role of lectins in the entry of CCoVs has not been studied so far. it has been shown that HCoV-229E binds human APN in rafts. this virus is internalized through a novel clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway that depends essentially on dynamin. nsp16 specifically binds capped RNAs of 3 to 6 nucleotides in length. methylates the ribose of the first nucleotide of the RNA and participates in the conversion of viral RNAs from a cap-0 to a cap-1 structure. this function is probably common to all coronaviruses. a chimeric virus in which the spike protein replaces that of 79-1146 poorly infects macrophages. the high virulent FIPV 79-1146 replicates efficiently in this cell type. the determinant of macrophage tropism was not localized within the receptor binding domain of the spike. the protein from MHV stimulates the expression of a gene implicated in the development of fulminant hepatitis. two phylogenetic studies have been conducted on FIPV- and FECV-infected cats. evidence for their role in the FIPV pathotype comes from sequence comparisons of FECV and FIPV field strains. ORF 3c encodes an accessory triple-spanning membrane protein, 238 residues in length. it's predicted topology is similar to that of the M protein and the 3a protein of SARS-CoV. it is likely that alternative mutations can generate the virulent FIPV biotype. chimeric virus in which the spike protein replaces that of FIPV 79-1146 poorly infects macrophages. the high virulent FIPV 79-1146 replicates efficiently in this cell type. the determinant of macrophage tropism was not localized within the receptor binding domain of the spike. the first study suggesting a role for the M protein in FIPV pathogenesis. sequences from additional cats with FIP are required to draw definitive conclusions. two phylogenetic studies have been conducted on FIPV- and FECV-infected cats. ORF 3c encodes an accessory triple-spanning membrane protein, 238 residues in length. its predicted topology is similar to that of the M protein and the 3a protein of SARS-CoV, despite their high degree of sequence diversity. the specific properties of Feline APN In general, the APN receptor is used by alphacoronaviruses in a species-specific manner, that is, human APN is the cellular receptor for HCoV-229E, but not for the porcine coronaviruses. feline APN is a functional receptor for many alphacoronaviruses, including feline, human, feline, and porcine. HCoV-229E, FCoV, TGEV, and CCoV probably evolved from the same ancestral alphacoronavirus. mutations in the S protein may have led to the appearance of viruses able to infect other host species by means of their cognate APN proteins. in vivo, cats can be infected with CCoV and with human HCoV-229E without developing symptoms. infected animals shed the virus from the pharynx from 2 to 10 days postinfection. CCoV-IIb results from a cross-species jump of CCoV-II from dogs to pigs. CCoV-IIb results from a double recombination between CCoV-II and TGEV. aa 288 to 290 are essential for the entry of HCoV-229E. TGEV requires the region corresponding to aa 732 to 746 of feline APN. CCoV and FCoV necessitate both aa 732 to 746 and aa 764 to 788. nonfeline coronaviruses have never been formally reported in naturally infected cats. interspecific circulation of either CCoV-I and CCoV-II occurred in one of these species, which led, after a double recombination event, to the emergence of FCoV-I. CCoV-IIb results from a double recombination between CCoV-II and TGEV. findings suggest coinfection has occurred in at least one host species. coronaviruses have crossed and in all likelihood will continue to cross between species, thus causing emerging disease in new host species. will again be helpful."}
