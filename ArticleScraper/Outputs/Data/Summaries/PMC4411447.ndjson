{"summary": "IB is an economically important poultry disease affecting the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems of chickens. both classic and variant IBV serotypes have been identified in most countries. the disease is associated with huge economic losses resulting from decreased egg production, poor carcass weight, and high morbidity. review aims at describing progress and challenges associated with IBV vaccine development. review 2.1. Aetiology and Genome Characteristics Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Beluga whale coronavirus belong to a Gammacoronavirus subgroup. IBV is made up of 3400 nucleotides posttranslationally cleaved into S1 (520 AAS residue) at the amino terminal and S2 (625 AAS residue) at the carboxyl terminal. S1-glycoprotein plays a role in receptor binding, while the S2 contributes aids in the fusion of the virus. coronavirus matrix protein (M-protein) protrudes to the surface and is situated between 220 and 262 aa, which is glycosylated on the N-terminal domain. the role of glycosylation of M-protein is still not clear; however, using the MHV model, it was found that cell infected with MHV containing N-glycosylated M-protein induces a better interferon response compared to those infected with O IBV small envelope protein is a scant protein and contains highly hydrophobic transmembrane N-terminal and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains. this protein has been suggested to be associated with viral envelope formation, assembly, budding, ion channel activity, and apoptosis [36, 37]. 2.7. Serotypes and Strain Variations Currently, there are several classical and variant IBV strains that have spread in different countries. phylogenetic analysis was carried out using Geneious software version R8. 2.8. mutation and recombination are important phenomena that shape coronavirus viral genomes. a viral subpopulation may evolve as a result of these important genetic events. IBV genome is made up of a single stranded enveloped RNA. it measures from 27 to 32 kb, making it the largest of the RNA viruses. four different genes encoding for structural proteins are found in IBV genome. IBV is made up of 3400 nucleotides posttranslationally cleaved into S1 (520 AAS residue) at the amino terminal and S2 (625 AAS residue) at the carboxyl terminal. Typically, S1-glycoprotein plays a role in receptor binding, while the S2 contributes aids in the fusion of the virus. studies on the function of 5a-ns segment using reverse genetics have identified a possible link between ns-protein and virus virulence. coronavirus matrix protein (M-protein) slightly protrudes to the surface and is situated between 220 and 262 aa, which is glycosylated on the N-terminal domain. IBV small envelope \u201cE\u201d protein is a scant protein. it contains highly hydrophobic transmembrane N-terminal and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains. this protein has been suggested to be associated with viral envelope formation, assembly, budding, ion channel activity, and apoptosis. phylogenetic analysis was carried out using Geneious software version R8. 2.8. mutation and recombination are important phenomena that shape coronavirus viral genome. a viral subpopulation may evolve as a result of these important genetic events. it was found that regions encoding for the nonstructural proteins 2, 3, and 16, as well as the spike glycoprotein, exhibited the highest degree of recombination [50]. Similarly, experimental passaging of IBV in the presence of other immunosuppressive viruses has been suggested to affect IBV evolutionary dynamics. interferon gamma secretion is predominantly produced by activated NK cells, dendritic cells, and CD4+ CD8+ T-lymphocytes. this will further enhance leukocytes adhesion, cause NK cells activation, and increase antigen presentation on the surface of APCs. the toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as the TLR4, TLR5, TLR15, and TLR16 are involved in the innate sensing during viral IL-1, oligoadenylate synthetase, and oligoadenylate synthetase signalling pathways may serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunities following IBV vaccination [63]. il-1, MIP-1, and IFN signalling pathways may serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunities following IBV vaccination. a significant increase in the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been reported. this may be associated with an increase in the expression of granzymes A during primary IBV infection and subsequent activation of NK cells that aid in direct or targeted killing of IBV-infected cells. despite advances in understanding of mucosal immunology, much is yet to be learned about mucosal immune responses in birds. innate immune response is important as the body's first line of defence. innate immune response relies on pathogen-associated molecular patterns. this response relies on pathogen-associated molecular patterns. this response relies on specific pattern-recognition receptors. innate immune response is associated with the secretion of type I interferon in the trachea, lungs, and kidney shortly after contact with the virus. this response depends on the virulence of IBV as well as the host adaptability of the viral strain. studies have shown that both systemic (IgM and IgG) and mucosal (IgA) antibodies are essential determinants for effective clearance of the circulating virus. IgA plays a role in antibody homing at tracheal or other mucosal points of viral entry. live attenuated vaccinated chickens with a recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rN) and recombinant S1-protein- (rS-) based IBV vaccine induced significant cell-mediated immune responses without booster vaccination or adjuvants. birds vaccinated with such vaccines were shown to be protected against infection with virulent virus strain. some commercially available live attenuated IBV vaccines have been combined with other virus vaccines such as those against Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. but it is not clear whether the combination may influence immune response to the combined antigen. some limitations of live attenuated viral vaccines include reversion to virulence, tissue damage, and interference by MDA. inactivated or killed vaccines have been used either alone or in combination with live attenuated IBV vaccines. compared to live attenuated vaccines, killed vaccines induce shorter immune response characterized by antibody production but not T-cell-mediated responses. combinant vector vaccines have been developed against IBV. they induce significant increase in the immune response and protect against IB disease. the technology does have limitations that include preexisting immunity or maternally derived immunity. adenovirus vector vaccines have been shown to be promising for use in poultry oral vaccines. oral immunization of mice with adenovirus vector was shown to circumvent neutralization of the vector by preexisting or maternally derived antibody. improvements are needed for optimal T-cell response. synthetic epitope peptide corresponding to S20-S255 reacted well with polyclonal antibodies against various IBV strains. these broad vaccines have also been mapped between 19 and 69 as well as 250 AAS sequences within the receptor binding domain whose N-terminal plays role in viral entry. birds receiving either in ovo DNA vaccination alone or live attenuated vaccine alone had 80% protection after challenge with a virulent IBV strain. 80% of immunized birds received 80% protection after challenge with a virulent IBV strain. some limitations including route of administration could be overcome using in ovo DNA vaccination at the hatchery or by giving vaccines in drinking water or as a spray vaccine. a nanoparticle-mediated DNA delivery will help protect the vaccine against enzymatic degradation and enhances their availability at mucosal surfaces for mucosal response. the future of reverse genetic vaccines may be born out of their potentials to abrogate issues of reversion to virulence. development of reverse genetic-based live attenuated IBV vaccines will surely revolutionise the use of reverse genetic-based live attenuated IBV vaccines. but whether these newer generation vaccines will increase or reduce the chances of mutation and viral selection pressure requires further studies. some commercially available live attenuated vaccines have been combined with other virus vaccines such as those against Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. some limitations of live attenuated viral vaccines include reversion to virulence, tissue damage, and interference by MDA. some limitations of live attenuated viral vaccines include reversion to virulence, tissue damage, and interference by MDA. inactivated or killed vaccines have been used either alone or in combination with live attenuated IBV vaccines. compared to live attenuated vaccines, killed vaccines induce shorter immune response characterized by antibody production but not T-cell-mediated responses. this may increase the costs associated with vaccine development and marketing, thus limiting their applications. experimental recombinant vector vaccines have been developed against IBV. these vaccines were shown to induce significant increase in the immune response and protect against IB disease. this technology does have limitations that include issue of preexisting immunity or maternally derived immunity that interferes with the live vector itself. adenovirus vector vaccines have been shown to be promising for use in poultry oral vaccines. adenovirus vector vaccines are finding ways into veterinary vaccines. lentivirus-based IB vaccines are finding ways into veterinary vaccines. synthetic epitope peptide corresponding to S20-S255 reacted well with polyclonal antibodies against various IBV strains. these broad vaccines have also been mapped between 19 and 69 as well as 250 AAS sequences within the receptor binding domain whose N-terminal plays role in viral entry. birds receiving either in ovo DNA vaccination alone or live attenuated vaccine alone had 80% protection after challenge with a virulent IBV strain. 80% of birds receiving either in ovo DNA vaccinations had a protective immune response. a nanoparticle-mediated DNA delivery will protect the vaccine against enzymatic degradation and enhance availability at mucosal surfaces for mucosal response. other advantages of DNA vaccines include induction of antibodies and T-cells immune response, safety, ability to express multiple proteins, and cost of production. a recombinant adenovirus vaccine containing IBV-S1-glycoprotein reported a significant antibody response that conferred 90\u2013100% protection against tracheal lesions. a fowl pox virus vaccine expressing IBV-S1-gene and chicken interferon- gene enhances humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that protect chickens against homologous and heterologous challenge. oral immunization of mice with adenovirus vector has been shown to circumvent neutralization of the vector by preexisting or maternally derived antibody. adenovirus vector vaccines are promising for use in poultry oral vaccines. lentivirus-based IB vaccines are finding ways into veterinary vaccines. synthetic and peptide vaccines have been shown to be promising in the control of IBV. some researchers have focused on developing multiepitope peptide vaccines for use against wide range of IBV serotypes. a bacterial system was used to deliver peptide vaccines orally. intramuscular injection of liposome-encapsulated multiepitope DNA vaccine resulted in increased numbers of CD4+, CD3+, and CD8+ cells. some of the advantages of epitope-based vaccines include the ability to package several immunogens in a small delivery system for targeted antibody and CTL responses. a reverse genetic vaccine involved a new technology of manipulating one or more viral genes. it involved a new technology of manipulating one or more viral genes. the future of reverse genetic vaccines may be born out of their potentials to abrogate issues of reversion to virulence. the use of reverse genetic-based live attenuated IBV vaccines will surely revolutionise the use of reverse genetic-based live attenuated IB vaccines. but whether these newer generation vaccines will increase or reduce the chances of mutation and viral selection pressure requires further studies. a summary of important limitations associated with the vaccine types is presented in Figure 3. a modified strategy from baculovirus vectoring was used recently to display the IBV-M41 serotype. about 83% of the challenged birds were shown to be protected. this is comparable to 89% protection obtained in birds immunized with commercial inactivated vaccine. a chimeric vaccine has been synthesized using a vaccinia virus-based IBV vaccine. it induced significant S1-specific antibodies in mice and chickens, neutralizing antibody in chickens, and increased IL-4 secretion in immunized mice. the chimeric vaccine induced significant S1-specific antibodies in mice and chickens. a transgenic potato under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus (35S) promoter gene was shown to be protected against homologous challenge. an improved \u201cBacMam\u201d virus surface display technology was used recently to display the S1-glycoprotein of IBV-M41 serotype. chimeric vaccine has been synthesized using the IBV-M- and IBV-S-genes. chimeric vaccine induced significant antibodies in mice and chickens. there is a huge potential for VLP-based vaccines as innovative candidate. use of plasmid DNA vaccines circumvents the effect of neutralization by preexisting immunity. future IBV vaccines must induce broad protection against different IBV serotypes, overcome maternal immunity, meet international safety regulations."}
