{"summary": "conservation status of known biodiversity has undergone a worrying decline in the last few decades. conservation breeding programs (CBPs) may offer the only feasible option to avoid the extinction of particular species until appropriate habitat can be found or restored. the need for well-managed CBPs, including those supported by the zoo community, has never been greater. a continuum of management practices exists, which range from wild and self-sustaining populations to managed populations dependent on a certain level of human care for persistence. zoos have extensive knowledge of the husbandry, behavior and veterinary procedures required to develop CBPs [17], and members of the world association of zoos and aquariums are the third largest financial supporter of species conservation in their natural habitats. ISIS is a network of more than 800 zoos and aquariums that shares information about 2.5 million individuals. this information system makes it possible to analyze the amount of space devoted to threatened species and its spatial distribution. ISIS is a key institution to assess the potential of zoos to develop CBPs. algorithm was based on an iterative procedure that randomly sampled zi species within every order from the worldwide list. the algorithm then calculated the indicator yi,j,s that assigned 1 if a number j of threatened species were sampled and 0 otherwise, such that j = 0,..., min(zi, mi) the probability of randomly finding j threatened species is calculated as where S is the total number of iterations. the algorithm was based on a Monte Carlo procedure that, at each step s, a zoo j was selected at random, then found all zoos zj,r located at a distance r from zoo j, as well as the number of zoos within that radial distance that held species i. the algorithm then counted how many individuals of a given threatened species i were included in the cluster. we repeated this procedure for radii ranging from 0 to 10,000 km. for each class C and metapopulation threshold m, we calculated the average ratio between probability pi,r,m and distance dr for radius r as where IC is the total number of threatened species in class C that was included in the analysis. the algorithm calculated the number of threatened species in zoos. the probability of randomly finding j threatened species is calculated as where S is the total number of iterations. at each cluster, we assigned the indicator where m is a pre-established metapopulation threshold (i.e. 50, 100 or 250 individuals) we chose 50, 100 and 250 individual metapopulation thresholds because a population size of 50 has been historically considered as a minimum viable population. only 44 species (6.3%) have more than 1,000 individuals. in 2011, the 837 ISIS zoos held 3,955 species of non-domestic terrestrial vertebrates. of these, more than half (58%) were birds, one quarter (25%) were mammals, 11% were reptiles and 6% were amphibians. the reptile assessment by IUCN is not yet complete. the results only refer to the species assessed in the IUCN Red List version 3.2 (2009). the seven IUCN Red List categories are DD = Data Deficient, LC = Least Concern, NT = Near Threatened, VU = Vulnerable, EN = Endangered, CR = Critically Endangered, EW = Extinct in the Wild. most collections are not distinguishable from what would be expected if the species were selected at random. the size of the point corresponds to the number of threatened species for each order. labels correspond to: a) Caudata;

NGOs and academia should be fostered. such collaborations are already underway, and termed a One Plan approach [16]."}
