{"summary": "2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) polymerizes ATP to 2\u2019-5\u2019-linked oligomers of adenylate (2-5As) these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNAs or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. the 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. ribonucleoside to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase. the absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm."}
