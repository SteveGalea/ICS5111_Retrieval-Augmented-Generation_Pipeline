{"summary": "an individual's chance of becoming infected after a single sexual exposure is often lower than one in 100. heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa could explain the low infection-to-exposure ratio and selection of the founder strain after sexual exposure to HIV. this could explain the low infection-to-exposure ratio and selection of the founder strain after sexual exposure. the basic reproductive number, R 0, describes the average number of secondary infections that arise from one infected individual in an otherwise totally susceptible population. the average probability that a susceptible individual will become infected by a single infected individual during its infectious period is called the \u201cindividual reproductive number\u201d [14]. epidemiological outbreak investigations have identified the existence of superspreaders in many well-known infectious disease outbreaks. these rare individuals often make a significant, sometimes deciding, contribution to the dynamics of disease spread. these rare individuals often make a significant, sometimes deciding, contribution to the dynamics of disease spread. five infected individuals, however, were superspreaders, each infecting at least 20 others. most people (gray circles) transmitted the virus to very few others. a few individuals acted as superspreaders, infecting many more people than average. cell density and spatial arrangement have been identified as important sources of heterogeneity among cells that can affect virus spread in vitro [8], [28]\u2013[30]. cell density and spatial arrangement have been identified as important sources of heterogeneity among cells that can affect virus spread in vitro. variation in expression of CD4, CCR5, and the coreceptor CXCR4 influenced permissivity of individual cells to HIV binding and entry. heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in expression of specific cell surface receptors can thus affect permissivity and cell-to-cell transfer of HIV infection. a significant heterogeneity may exist in the number of contacts that become infected by any given infected cell even within the same host, potentially leading to a skewed distribution of ICRN. variability in virus gene expression at the level of individual cells has been demonstrated in vivo in a mouse model of cytomegalovirus infection. a wide range of ICRN may exist within the population of CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa. a wide range of ICRN may exist due to stochastic and/or infection-driven variations in viral gene expression and viral particle production. Activated CD4+ T cells express higher levels of CCR5 [33] and 47 [40] than resting cells. Resting CD4+ T cells can become infected with HIV but do not produce infectious virus. infection of activated CD4+ T cells, which tend to form clusters, have higher levels of gene expression than resting cells, and produce infectious virus. infection of a single cell with very high ICRN could thus be the superspreading event that establishes HIV infection in the genital mucosa and selects a single founder strain. such a founding superspreader infection event would parallel, for example, the dynamics that governed the SARS outbreak in Singapore. a group of nonhuman primates exposed to a low physiological dose of SIV experienced initial low levels of viral replication and immune response without ever proceeding to full infection or seroconversion. some HIV-exposed, seronegative humans exhibit immunological markers that indicate a prior immune response to HIV infection. there is, however, no direct experimental evidence for occult infection in humans. a skewed distribution of individual cellular reproductive number among CD4+ T cells in the genital mucosa gives rise to cellular superspreaders that may drive establishment of HIV infection inside the genital mucosa after sexual transmission. the definition of R0 implicitly integrates transmission over the time that an index cell was infected, meaning that we have incorporated duration of infectiousness into our overall definition of R0. the most successful strategy for preventing the infection from becoming established in the body is to block or remove these cells before or shortly after infection. such cells may have specific traits, such as high expression of surface receptors including CCR5 and possibly also 47, that allow them to be identified and targeted by novel therapies. heterogeneity among cells has been acknowledged as an important factor in a variety of cellular processes. the epidemiological framework described here may also be applicable to the establishment and spread of other cellular diseases inside the body."}
