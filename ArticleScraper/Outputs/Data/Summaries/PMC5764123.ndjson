{"summary": "SARS-CoV belongs to the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae. all CoV virions possess three envelope proteins, two major glycoproteins, membrane (M) proteins, spike (S) proteins and minor small envelope (E) proteins incorporated into the CoV envelope. in protein trafficking, three envelope (membrane) proteins must be transported and retained near the ERGIC. membrane proteins generally reach the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway. in protein trafficking, three envelope (membrane) proteins must be transported and retained near the ERGIC. ER retrieval signal (ERRS) can be classified into dilysine (KKxx-COOH) or dibasic (KxHxx-COOH) motifs. the other retention signal is a tyrosine-dependent localization signal (YxxI or YxxF motif) the clustalw program performed the amino acid sequence alignment. the orange box indicates ERRS (KxHxx- or KKxx-motif) however, the inherent retention potency of ERRS varies significantly among CoV genera or species. recombinant IBV lacking dilysine ERRS reduced growth only at later time-points post-infection. growth of murine adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) lacking dibasic ERRS remained unchanged compared with original PEDV. ERRS of both IBV and PEDV had little effect on viral replication. tS was retained intracellularly and strongly co-localized with M protein at the Golgi. mutant S protein did not co-localize with M protein, resulting in mutant S protein release to the plasma membrane. wtS proteins were digested with or without Endo H to evaluate their localization. 293T cells expressing wtS or S2A with or without co-expression of M protein were metabolically labelled at 40 h post-transfection for 20 min and then chased for 0 or 60 min. cellular S proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sect-2 and immunocomplexes were mock-treated (or treated with Endo H (+) 293T cells expressing wtS or S2A with or without M protein were labelled for 20 min and chased for various times over a 6 h period. both S proteins showed upper bands, corresponding to the endo H-resistant form, primarily after the 30 min chase. the amount of the resistant form increased until 120 min chase, and then total band densities gradually decreased until 360 min chase. 293T cells expressing wtS or S2A were labelled and chased for the indicated times. S protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Sect-2 and analysed by SDS-PAGE. the band densities corresponding to wtS and S2A were quantified. both proteins were digested with PNGase F, and their band densities were compared on the same gel. the total expression of wtS was reduced by 25 % without M protein compared with that of wtS protein. wtS was retained at the Golgi and strongly co-localized with M protein. S2A did not co-localize with M protein, resulting in release to the plasma membrane where the carbohydrate chains of S protein acquired a Endo H-resistant form. a small amount of endo H-resistant form of S2A protein was detected at steady state. wtS was retained at the pre- and post-medial Golgi intracellularly and co-localized with M protein at the Golgi. a small amount of endo H-resistant form of S2A was detected at steady state in the presence of M protein. a small amount of endo H-resistant form of S2A was detected at steady state in the presence of M protein. SARS-CoV E, M and N plasmids were labelled at 48 h post-transfection with 35S methionine/cysteine for 18 h. cellular S protein was detected as described above and cellular N and M proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-N and anti-M rabbit antiserum. band densities of cellular wtS and -resistant forms were quantified and standardized to the density of M protein. intracellular accumulation of S protein by ERRS contributed to incorporation of wtS and S2A proteins into VLPs. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.75\u20132.25 g pCAGGS-S. ellular S proteins were detected as described in Fig. 4 and cellular M and N proteins were immunoblotted using anti-M or -N rabbit serum. wtS- and S2A-VLPs (1.5 g pCAGGS-SARS-CoV S or S2A was co-transfected with E, M and N plasmids) were concentrated and added to 293T cells transiently expressing ACE2. cells were washed with ice-cold 0.2 % BSA-PBS three times. the reduced cell attachment ability of S2A-VLPs is likely due to low-level incorporation of S2A protein into VLPs. expression of M protein led to different intracellular trafficking between wild-type S and S2A proteins. both S proteins expressed independently (without M protein) showed a single band sensitive to Endo H without chase, and two bands under the 60 min chase. this suggests that both proteins reached the medial Golgi similarly after a 60 min chase. wtS proteins were not processed to Endo H resistance after a 60 min chase. wtS and S2A proteins were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and band densities were compared from the same gel to evaluate the expression of wtS and S2A proteins under 60 min chase. however, the detection sensitivity of both S proteins was reduced when M protein was co-expressed. the kinetics of wtS resistance to Endo H digestion were remarkably slower than that of S2A in the presence of M protein. wtS could accumulate at the pre- and post-medial Golgi compartments for 120\u2013360 min. S2A lacking the ERRS could be partially retained at the pre-medial Golgi compartment but failed to accumulate at the post-medial Golgi compartment at 360 min. 293T cells transiently expressing wtS or S2A with or without M protein were lysed at 66 h post-transfection. proteins were immunoprecipitated with mouse mAb SKOT-3. they were then digested with or without endo H or PNGase F. wtS was retained at the Golgi intracellularly and strongly co-localized with M protein. S2A did not co-localize with M protein, resulting in release to the plasma membrane where the carbohydrate chains of S protein acquired a Endo H-resistant form. cal microscopy showed that both proteins overlapped with ER-membrane marker calnexin and partially with Golgi-marker 1.4-galactosyltransferase throughout the secretory pathway. on the other hand, when M protein was co-expressed, the majority of wtS was retained intracellularly, with little detected on the cell surface. 293T cells co-transfected with 0.75\u20132.25 g pCAGGS-SAR-CoV S or S2A plasmids with constant amount of pCAGGS-SARS-CoV E, M and N plasmids were labelled at 48 h post-transfection with 35S methionine/cysteine. wtS and S2A protein levels have a tendency to increase dose-dependently with the transfected endo H-sensitive and -resistant forms of wtS proteins were successfully incorporated in VLPs. wtS that passed through the ERGIC became Endo H-resistant in the medial Golgi compartment. however, a portion of ERRS-harbouring wtS could return to the ERGIC for subsequent incorporation into VLPs. band densities corresponding to wtS proteins were set to 1.0. results are shown as meanssd from three independent experiments. wtS- and S2A-VLPs were concentrated and added to 293T cells. 35S lablled S proteins of VLPs could be deteced before cell attachment. only wtS of VLPs could be detected by immunoblotting with S1-2 antiserum. reduced cell attachment ability of S2A-VLPs likely due to low-level incorporation of S2A protein into VLPs. wtS and S2A proteins were detected on the cell surface and displayed similar subcellular localization in HeLa cells. previous IF studies showed that wtS proteins were strongly co-localized with M proteins at the Golgi and were retained intracellularly. S2A proteins failed to be co-localized and were released to the plasma membrane. IF study showed that only a few S2A proteins were detected on the cell surface. it is possible that newly synthesized S proteins were continuously replenished rather than degraded due to the difference in time during the studies. wtS having the ERRS would return to the ERGIC for subsequent incorporation into VLPs (Endo H-resistant form) wtS lacking the ERRS that first arrived at the ERGIC was incorporated into VLPs in similar way of wtS. however, S2A that passed through the ERGIC would fail to return to the ERGIC or be subject to rapid degradation. tyrosine signals of TGEV and IBV could function as a potent retention signal. recombinant IBV lacking ERRS was recovered and showed fewer growth defects. tyrosine signal is important for virion formation, rather than the ERRS. anti-calnexin rabbit polyclonal (Abcam), anti-actin mAb (Wako), anti-actin polyclonal rabbit antibody (Bioss), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased. cDNAs encoding SARS-CoV S, M, N and E protein were subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector immunocomplexes were washed and released from beads by boiling for 5 min. washed immunocomplex-bound sepharose beads were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or Endo H (New England Biolabs) protein bands were visualized with ECL prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) on an LAS-4000 instrument (Fujifilm) and band densities were quantified with Multi Gauge v3.2 software. at 40 h post-transfection, COS-7 cells expressing SARS-CoV S and M protein were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.25 g pAcGFP1-Golgi Vector. cells were co-transfected with 0.75\u20132.25 g pCAGGS-SARS-CoV S. cells were co-transfected with 0.75\u20132.25 g pCAGGS-SARS-CoV S. plasmid and other plasmids were collected at 66 h post-transfection. pellet was added to 293T cells transiently expressing ACE2. cells were detached from wells and washed with ice-cold 0.2 % BSA-PBS three times. cDNAs encoding SARS-CoV S, M, N and E protein were subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector. cDNAs encoding SARS-CoV S, M, N and E protein were subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector. immunocomplexes were washed and released from beads by boiling for 5 min. washed immunocomplex-bound sepharose beads were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or Endo H (New England Biolabs) lumox multiwell 24 (Sarstedt) were co-transfected with 1.0 g pCAGGS-SARS-CoV S with or without 0.25 g pCAGGS-SARS-CoV M plasmid using the TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus) at 40 h post-transfection, COS-7 cells expressing SARS-CoV S and M protein were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.75\u20132.25 g pCAGGS- SARS-CoV S. cells were incubated in DMEM Met/Cys- for 1 h and metabolically labelled with Tran-35S label (2.5 Ci) at 47 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM. cells were detached from wells and washed with ice-cold 0.2 % BSA-PBS three times. after washing, the cells were suspended in sample buffer, boiled and analysed."}
