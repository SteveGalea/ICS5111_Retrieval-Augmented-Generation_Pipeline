{"summary": "viruses initiate the cycle of infection by attachment of viral surface proteins to specific target cell receptors. most of the viral surface proteins have extremely immunogenic structures that can bind and stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. ADE was first reported in 1964 by Hawkes et al. mechanisms of ADE of viral infections: 1) Enhancement on CR-bearing cells: (1) Formation of virus-antibody complexes. this complex activates the complement pathway by binding to C1q. anti-HA2 Khurana et al., 2013 Pneumonia - interlobular and alveolar edema- hemorrhage- peribronchiolar lymphocytic cuffing- lung lesion Pigs Anti- HA2 promote pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.

ADE is classically explained by enhanced virus uptake in an Fc mediated mechanism. other Fc-independent mechanisms have been suggested to cause enhancement. enhancing antibodies are directed toward the post-fusion conformation of the HA2. however, pre-fusion stem-directed antibodies act as inhibitors of viral fusion and are unlikely to cause ADE. the current available data suggest that ADE of influenza is strain specific. infection with RSV is initiated by two major surface glycoproteins. attachment glycoprotein (G) and the fusion glycoprotein (F) are targets of neutralizing antibodies and being considered for recombinant vaccines development. two vaccinated infants also died because of enhanced RSV infections. increased levels of IL-4 were associated with enhanced lung pathology. IL-4 combined with IL-10 depletion, or depletion of CD4 cells, abrogated enhanced pulmonary histopathology induced by RSV inactivated vaccine. affinity maturation can explain why ADE did not develop in children who were seropositive to RSV before vaccination. ADE occurs only once in a lifetime, as naturally occurring viral infection results in the activation of new subset of B cells that mature to produce high avidity antibodies. this would prevent enhanced disease during reinfections and restore a healthy immune response. studies from the same group showed most neutralizing antibodies in human sera are directed to the pre-F protein. immunization with pre-F elicits potent neutralizing antibodies. immunization with pre-F induced protective immune responses. antigenic site was found to induce higher neutralization activity than other epitopes. the stabilized pre-F has been considered a promising vaccine especially for vulnerable groups including young infants, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and elderly. antibody-mediated cell entry was suggested as a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV infection of immune cells. anti-spike antibodies potentiate infection of immune cells with both SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles and replication-competent SARS-CoV. es was linked to anti-spike IgG, specifically through FcRII signaling. ADE response was stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins. lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L was found to play a crucial role to achieve an efficient infection. double inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in mice failed to provide complete protection and caused enhanced eosinophilic pro-inflammatory pulmonary response after infection. more studies are critically needed to address and understand this issue in humans. the presence of non-neutralizing cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronaviruses could contribute to MER-CoV-induced ADE. this remains unstudied and requires further investigation while developing and testing coronaviruses vaccines. the first study that reported ADE in the context of influenza infection appeared in 1980 using a rat model to assess the response to heterologous challenge after immunization. antibodies of rabbits previously exposed to influenza mediate influenza A growth in macrophages via FcR entry and in a concentration dependent manner. s with pdm09 recombinant hemagglutinin subunit elicited high neutralizing antibodies to the homologous virus. but induced vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) in a heterologous virus challenge (Rajao et al., 2016). antibodies associated with ADE in pigs vaccinated with whole inactivated H1N2 (human-like) vaccine. sera from immunized pigs showed high titers of cross-reactive anti-H1N1 HA antibodies that were directed to the HA2 region but not the HA1 head. this study highlighted the role of anti-HA2 antibodies in enhancing viral fusion via Fc-independent pathway. non-neutralizing antibodies are thought to stimulate Th2 immune response, resulting in formation of immune complexes and tissue damage. however, as in most respiratory infections, T cell immune response to influenza is strongly biased toward Th1 cells, leading to the production of TNF, IL-2, and IFN. hospitalization in 80% of vaccinated infants, compared to only 5% of non-immunized infants. two vaccinated infants also died because of enhanced RSV infections. immunization with formalin-inactivated RSV resulted in similar responses in animals. formalin inactivated measles vaccine elicited non-protective low avidity antibodies. this resulted in atypical sever measles, which belongs to the same family. ADE occurs only once in a lifetime, as naturally occurring viral infection results in the activation of new subset of B cells. this would prevent enhanced disease during reinfections and restore a healthy immune response. however, an RSV recombinant vaccine, which does not encode for G protein, induced a similar ADE response to the wild type virus. immunization with virus like particles (VLP) combined with adjuvants induced protective immune responses. combined vaccines containing both pre- and post- F proteins induced the highest neutralization responses (Cimica et al., 2016). antigenic site was found to induce higher neutralization activity than other epitopes. it highlights the importance of pre-F antigen to boost or induce functional and highly potent antibody response against RSV. a novel efficacious protective vaccine will require a careful evaluation in animals and humans in the context of enhanced disease illness. ADE response is stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins rather than nucleoproteins. immunization with recombinant full-length S-protein elicited protective immune response in vivo. but induced viral infection of human B cells in vitro via FcRII-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways. lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L was found to play a crucial role to achieve an efficient infection. lysosomal infection occur independently of the endosomal acidic pH or the activity of cysteine proteases. however, clinical studies investigating ADE in SARS-CoV patients are limited. vaccinated transgenic mice with whole inactivated MERS-CoV developed eosinophilic infiltration combined with enhanced lung disease after MERS-CoV challenge. some of these vaccines were evaluated in non-human models. antibody-mediated cell entry was suggested as a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV infection of immune cells. anti-spike antibodies were able to potentiate infection of immune cells with both SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles and replication-competent SARS-CoV. ADE response is stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins rather than nucleoproteins. lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L was found to play a crucial role to achieve an efficient infection. vaccines were able to protect against SARS-CoV infection, but still induced Th2 directed pulmonary immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components. double inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in mice failed to provide complete protection and caused enhanced eosinophilic pro-inflammatory pulmonary response after infection. the presence of non-neutralizing cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronaviruses could contribute to MER-CoV-induced ADE. however, this remains unstudied and requires further investigation while developing and testing coronaviruses vaccines. cross-reactive antibodies against different DENV serotypes are predisposing factor for enhanced illness. deNV specific ADE was found to be correlated with increased viremia rate. infants with passive-acquired immunity from DENV immune mothers tend to develop sever DHF following primary DENV infection. deNV enhanced illness is mediated through CR3 and IgM-dependent manner. CRs are widely distributed in many cells and are not restricted to immune cells like FcRs. the case with DENV is more complicated due to the circulation of four antigenically cross-reactive serotypes. the manufacturer and the WHO to vaccinate only seropositive individuals aging between 9 and 45 years in endemic areas. the glycoprotein shell of the DENV consists of the envelope (E) and the membrane (M) proteins which have different conformations in the premature and mature virus. the protein is composed of three domains: E domains I- III (EDI, EDII, and EDIII) i et al., 2010; Pierson, 2010; Shrestha et al., 2010;. Shrestha et al., 2010); i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i et al., 2013; i e anti-prM antibodies are highly cross-reactive with low neutralizing potency even at high concentrations, thus promote FcR mediated ADE. anti-prM antibodies are also shown to recognize a cryptic DI-DII junction on the E protein. a cross-reactive non-neutralizing but enhancing antibody was mapped to amino acid corresponding to residues 14\u201318 of the prM protein (Luo et al., 2013). in consequence, prM antibodies can contribute significantly to enhanced infection and therefore, should be carefully evaluated when designing a DENV vaccine. Zika Virus Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus. it was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and remained restricted in parts of Africa and Asia until 2015. now it is endemic to several US territories. antibodies to the linear DENV epitopes were also able to drive ZIKV enhancement, as they were able to bind but not neutralize the virus. cross-reactive antibodies directed against EDI and EDII elicited by DENV or ZIKV infection showed poor neutralization and potent enhancement of both ZIKV and DENV. a study in mice indicated that ZIKV infection confers protection against WNV challenge. it was found that memory T cells produced against DENV infection recognize ZIKV conserved epitopes, leading to stronger and faster CD4 and CD8 cells responses. west Nile Virus WNV is another flavivirus that has been linked to ADE since 1980s. the virus has three structural proteins: capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins. most potent neutralizing antibody response to WNV infection in mice is directed to domain III of the E protein. epitopes at this region are exclusively found on the intact virion, but not on the recombinant E protein. antibodies to those epitopes were found to neutralize WNV infection by neutralizing the virus. cross-reactive antibodies against different DENV serotypes are predisposing factor for enhanced illness. deNV specific ADE was found to be correlated with increased viremia rate and contribute to the development of severe forms of the disease. the CR mechanism of enhancement is mediated through CR3 and IgM-dependent manner. the case with DENV is more complicated due to the circulation of four antigenically cross-reactive serotypes. in naturally occurring DENV infection, most of the produced antibodies are cross-reactive but poorly neutralizing. the glycoprotein shell of the DENV consists of the envelope (E) and the membrane (M) proteins which have different conformations in the premature and mature virus. in the immature virus particle, precursor membrane M (prM) and E proteins form heterodimers that make trimeric spikes. it has been shown that antibodies to the E protein are the major component of DENV neutralizing humoral response. mAb recognizing the bc loop of domain II adjacent to the fusion loop was found to have better neutralization and cross-reactivity to all four serotypes. more recently, it was found that most human neutralizing antibodies are generated against complex quaternary structures that are only assembled on the virion. removal of serotype cross-reactive antibodies eliminated the enhancement of heterotypic serotypes. the enhancement of homotypic serotype was not affected, indicating that the homotypic enhancement can occur if the type-specific antibodies are present at low concentrations. anti-E antibodies are partially responsible for DENV ADE. a cross-reactive non-neutralizing but enhancing antibody was mapped to amino acid corresponding to residues 14\u201318 of the prM protein (Luo et al., 2013). a cross-reactive non-neutralizing but enhancing antibody was mapped to amino acid corresponding to residues 14\u201318 of the prM protein (Luo et al., 2013). Zika Virus Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus. it was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and remained restricted in parts of Africa and Asia until 2015. now it is endemic to several US territories. NV epitopes such as the fusion loop of the E protein were also able to drive ZIKV enhancement, as they were able to bind but not neutralize the virus. cross-reactive antibodies directed against EDI and EDII elicited by DENV or ZIKV infection showed poor neutralization and potent enhancement of both ZIKV and DENV in cell culture, and lethal enhancement of DENV disease in mice. a study in mice indicated that ZIKV infection confers protection against WNV challenge. it was found that memory T cells produced against DENV infection recognize ZIKV conserved epitopes, leading to stronger and faster CD4 and CD8 cells responses. west Nile Virus WNV is another flavivirus linked to ADE since 1980s. virus has three structural proteins: capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins. ADE causes subclinical febrile illness in about 80% of the cases. most potent neutralizing antibody response to WNV infection in mice is directed to domain III of the E protein. epitopes at this region are exclusively found on the intact virion, but not on the recombinant E protein. ADE has also been reported for several other human and animal viruses. the main event of alphaviral disease enhancement involves macrophages. ADE has also been recorded in EBOV infections. EBOV belongs to the Filoviridae family and is the causative agent of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. a recent study by Furuyama et al. investigated the molecular mechanism of EBOV ADE highlighted the involvement of Scr family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in the Fc-receptor IIa (FcRIIa)-mediated ADE. they found that antibody-virus complexes bind to the cell surface FcRIIa and trigger the Src signaling pathway, which in turn contributes to facilitating the viral entry into in the use of high concentrations of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies showed improved efficacy and absence of ADE in animal models and human volunteers. there is no approved vaccine for EBOV, although many promising vaccine candidates are in clinical trials. this includes vector-based vaccines such as the replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) and the replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3) the entry of HIV to CD4 cells is mediated by conformational changes that occur after the interaction between the HIV envelope protein and CD4 and then chemokine receptor (such as CCR5) on the cell surface. this induces additional conformational changes in gp120 and facilitates its fusion with cell membrane and entry of the viral capsid into the target cell. target conformational epitopes targeted by T cells are short peptides. an effective HIV vaccine should be designed to contain both, conserved T cell epitopes and selected B cell epitopes capable of strictly eliciting bNAb, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) intrinsic ADE involves facilitating virus entry and infection into the cells. intrinsic ADE is the mechanism by which the innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral responses are altered, leading to increased virus production and consequently high viral loads. ADE diminish antiviral responses at the transcriptional level. ADE was associated with altered miRNA expression profile. a study by Boonnak et al. showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL10 promoter region affected the expression levels of ADE- associated IL10. ADE remains a concern when neutralizing antibodies are elicited at sub-neutralizing doses. evaluating vaccines in terms of protective and enhancing doses are crucially needed before vaccine administration. influenza (Ramakrishnan et al., 2016), spike S protein in SARS (Kam et al., 2007), E glycoprotein of flaviviruses (Bardina et al., 2017), transmembrane GP of HIV (Robinson et al., 1990a), GP of Ebola virus (Takada et al., 2001), and E2 glycoprotein of HCV."}
