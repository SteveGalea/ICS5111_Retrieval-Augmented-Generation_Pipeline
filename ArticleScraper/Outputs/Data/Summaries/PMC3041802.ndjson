{"summary": "coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) have evolved strategies to disable the innate immune system for productive replication and spread of infection. we have previously shown that papain-like protease domain 2 encodes a deubiquitinase (DUB) and inactivates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) thereby the type I interferon ( innate immune system senses microbial infection and initiates counteractive response through evolutionary conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at least three classes of PRRs have been identified, designated toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases (RLHs) and nucleotide-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) ubiquitination is to covalently conjugate the ubiquitin molecule(s) to the target proteins. ubiquitination chains involving these different K play important roles in regulation of diverse fates of proteins. ubiquitination is critical for IFN induction. ubiquitination does not always provide activation signal for IFN induction. RBCK1, TRIM21 and a Cullin-based ubiquitin ligase are identified to induce poly-ubiquitination of IRF3. this leads to proteasomal degradation and inactivation of IRF3. PLP2 of MHV-A59 nsp3 deubiquitinated and inactivated IRF3 to inhibit cellular IFN induction. TBK1 can be ubiquitinated by a cellular E3 ligase Nrdp1 [19]. luciferase reporter experiments showed that overexpressed TBK1 became K63-linked poly-ubiquitinated. HEK293T cells transiently transfected with 3.6 g HA-tagged ubiquitin K63 (HA-Ub-K63) expressing plasmids. at 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with SeV (HA titer 125) ubiquitination status of the endogenous TBK1 was immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. the immunoprecipitates were SDS-PAGE resolved and immunoblotted with antibody indicated. mouse IgG was used as IP controls for Myc or Flag antibodies. TBK1-driven IFN- promoter activity was effectively inhibited by the co-expressed PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A. deubiquitination of TBK1 and/or IRF3 by PLP2 would be sufficient to reduce IFN- promoter activities. ng for Renilla, 200 ng for Myc-TBK1 and increasing doses (100, 200 and 400 ng) for Myc-PLP2. fold activation over the sham vector (pCMV-Myc) was averaged from three independent experiments (meanSD) TBK1 as PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A specifically inhibited IRF3-driven IFN- promoter activities in Tbk1 / cells. this was also correlated with reduced poly-ubiquitination level of IRF3 by PLP2 in Tbk1 / cells. recombinant TBK1 purified from insect cells was already ubiquitinated. pre-incubation of PLP2 reduced ubiquitination level of TBK1. remarkably inhibited its kinase activity on IRF3. 8 g of each plasmid expressing Flag-TBK1(WT or K38A) and Myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. an equal amount of recombinant TBK1 (500 ng) was incubated with myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) immunopurified from HEK293T cells. anti-phospho-IRF3 antibody detected a decreasing phosphorylation of IRF3. hypo-phosphorylated IRF3 would have a higher affinity to TBK1 as evidenced by more TBK1 associated with unphosphorylated IRF3. the presence of PLP2 likely stabilized the complex of TBK1 and IRF3 by inhibiting the dissociation of IRF3 from TBK1. TBK1 and PLP2 associated with IRF3 were detected with anti-Myc antibody. hypo-ubiquitinated TBK1 bounds recombinant IRF3 more efficiently. ate was incubated with recombinant human TBK1 as in (B) TBK1 was immunoblotted with anti-TBK1 antibody. expression of the exogenous proteins was verified with the indicated antibodies. TBK1, IRF3 and PLP2 domain containing protein co-localize in one complex in MHV-A59 infected cells. TBK1 and PLP2 domain containing protein associated with TBK1/IRF3 complex were immunoblotted with anti-TBK1 antibody or antiserum. expression levels of the exogenous proteins were verified with the indicated antibodies. MHV-A59 nsp3 deubiquitinates TBK1 to inhibit cellular IFN induction. TBK1 was ubiquitinated at 8 h post Sendai virus. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PLP2 and its enzyme-dead mutant PLP2-C106A formed a complex with TBK1. further ubiquitination assay demonstrated that overexpressed TBK1 became K63-linked poly-ubiquitinated. this was effectively inhibited by a co-expressed PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A. TBK1 was not apparently degraded after viral infection as similar amounts of TBK1 were immunoabsorbed on beads. whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody for ubiquitin expression and massive cellular ubiquitination. expression of the exogenous epitope-tagged proteins was verified with the indicated antibodies (WCL). TBK1-driven IFN- promoter activities were monitored and normalized 24 h after transfection. deubiquitination of TBK1 and/or IRF3 by PLP2 would be sufficient to reduce IFN- promoter activities. deubiquitination of TBK1 and/or IRF3 by PLP2 inhibits TBK1-driven IFN- promoter activities in Traf3 / cells. plasmids expressing Flag-IRF3 and Myc-PLP2 were co-transfected into Tbk1 / cells. plasmids expressing Flag-IRF3, HA-Ub and Myc-PLP2 were co-transfected. ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of co-expressed PLP2 was affinity purified. the subsequent measurement of kinase activities using the purified C-terminal domain of IRF3 showed that the presence of PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A robustly inhibited the kinase activity of TBK1 in its autophosphorylation and IRF3 phosphorylation. TBK1 was incubated with recombinant GST-IRF3131\u2013426 (1 g) and -32P-ATP at 25\u00b0C for 30 min. an equal amount of recombinant TBK1 (500 ng) was incubated with Myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) immunopurified. 106A used in each reaction was measured by anti-Myc antibody. the presence of PLP2 likely stabilized the complex of TBK1 and IRF3 by inhibiting the dissociation of IRF3 from TBK1. GST-IRF3131\u2013426 interacted with hypo-ubiquitinated TBK1. TBK1 had a tendency to interact with hypo-ubiquitinated. if immunopurified Flag-IRF3 co-expressing with Myc-PLP2 was incubated. hypo-ubiquitinated TBK1 bounds recombinant IRF3 more efficiently. flag-TBK1 co-expressed with Myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) was immuno-purified as in Fig. 3A. each precipitate was incubated with recombinant GST-IRF3131\u2013426 (2 g) a 60 kD protein band could be detected as early as 2 h post MHV-A59 infection. we then overexpressed Flag-IRF3 in HEK293T-mCEACAM-1 cells or 17Cl-1 cells before MHV-A59 infection. TBK1, IRF3 and PLP2 domain containing protein co-localize in one complex in MHV-A59 infected cells. cell lysates of HEK293T ectopically expressing Myc-PLP2 were used as a positive control (lanes 6 and 12) PLP2 containing protein stabilizes TBK1-IRF3 complex in MHV-A59 infected 17Cl-1 cells. at 24 h post transfection, cells were simultaneously mock infected or infected. innate immune system is programmed to produce type I IFN to deter viral infection. ubiquitination is critically involved in the signaling process. viruses have adopted effective gene programs to evade or subvert the innate immune system of the host cells. deubiquitination of TBK1 and IRF3 by the viral PLP2 effectively reduce phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3. TBK1 is the primary target for PLP2 and deubiquitination of TBK1 would be sufficient for PLP2 to inhibit IFN signaling. a deubiquitinated TBK1 by PLP2 loses its kinase activity, thereby leads to more hypo- or un-phosphorylated IRF3 accumulated. a deubiquinated TBK1 by PLP2 loses its kinase activity, thereby leads to more hypo- or un-phosphorylated IRF3 accumulated. MHV-A59 may take advantage of its PLP2 to negatively regulate the type I IFN signaling via targeting TBK1 the hub kinase in IFN signaling. TBK1 and TRAF3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were routinely maintained in DMEM (Hyclone, UT) full-length human Tbk1 gene was PCR subcloned into different pCMV vectors (Clontech) in between SalI and NotI sites, to generate plasmids of Flag- or Myc-tagged TBK1. wild-type ubiquitin expression vector pRK5-HA-Ub and arginine substitutions of all lysine residues except for position 63. myc from Shanghai Genomics (Shanghai, China), phosphorylated STAT1, phosphorylated IRF3 and TBK1 were from Cell Signaling Tech (Beverly, MA). -32P- ATP was obtained from FuruiBio (Beijing, China) all other fine chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). RT-PCR was performed using RT-PCR kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's manual. hek293T (in 35 mm plates) or MEF cells (in 10 cm plates) were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TBK1 or its kinase dead mutant TBK1-K38A. TBK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates 36 h after transfection. beads were then mixed with purified GST-IRF3131\u2013426 protein (1 g) in 25 L kinase assay buffer. reaction took place at 25\u00b0C for 30 min before boiled in 1 SDS-PAGE loading dye for 5 min. cells and plasmids TBK1 and TRAF3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (Tbk1 / and Traf3 / MEF cells), wild-type MEF cells [43], [44], and HEK293T cells (ATCC, USA) were routinely maintained in DMEM (Hyclone, UT) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, Pasching, Austria) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (H full-length mouse Ceacam-1 gene was created by PCR and subcloned in frame into pBABE-puro vector in between EcoRI and SalI sites. to establish cell lines stably expressing MHVR, HEK293T cells seeded in a 12-well plate were transfected with 1.6 g pBABE-puro-mCEACAM-1. the stable clone was selected by 20-fold dilution in presence of anti-MHV-A59 PLP2 domain was prepared by CoWin Biotech (Beijing, China) using the full length recombinant PLP2 as the immunogen. transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. in vitro kinase assay for TBK1 kinase assays, HEK293T (in 35 mm plates) or MEF cells (in 10 cm plates) were transfected with plasmids (HEK293T cells 0.8 g, MEF cells 8 g) the yielded beads were then mixed with purified GST-IRF3131\u2013426 protein (1 g) in 25 L kinase assay buffer ( plasmids expression Myc-tagged PLP2 or its C106A mutant (1.6 g) was first transiently expressed in HEK293T cells (in 35 mm plates) followed by immunoprecipitation to 20 L Myc antibody-absorbed beads. the effect of PLP2 on deubiquitination of TBK1 was assessed by IB with anti-Ub antibody. whole cell lysates was immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody for ubiquitin expression and massive cellular ubiquitination (HA) total RNA of infected cells was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR with specific primers for MHV SM gene, SeV N gene, and mouse -actin to check the viability of viruses."}
