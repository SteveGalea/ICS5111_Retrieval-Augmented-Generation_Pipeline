{"summary": "viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in infants. we determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications. bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis. birth cohort studies on respiratory infections mostly came from outside the united states. updated prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis media, and lower respiratory tract infection in american infants. study personnel called parents weekly for 4 weeks after URI onset. parents were encouraged to bring the subject for examination whenever they suspected the infant might have an ear infection. investigators made the diagnosis based on acute symptoms (eg, fever, irritability, otalgia) the effect of colonization on presence of AOM was estimated by using a mixed model with month and AOM status as factors. the number of URIs was compared between subjects with and without AOM by using a standard Poisson model. study personnel visited the homes monthly to collect nasopharyngeal swabs. parents notified the study team for each URI: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or sore throat. at URI onset, and 3 to 5 days later, the subject was seen by the study physician. the electronic medical record was reviewed for any missed URI, AOM, or LRI. 13 respiratory viruses were detected, including bocavirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43. URI episodes, follow-up duration, and the number of URI episodes and complications are shown in Table 1. the investigators saw 413 (48%); the remaining were documented by phone or medical record review. URI prevalence was 3.7 and 3.2 per child-year in the first 6 and 12 months. URI prevalence was 3.7 and 3.2 per child-year in the first 6 and 12 months. there were 66 LRI episodes (51 subjects) that occurred after URI. the rate of LRI complicating URI was 7.6%. the prevalence of LRI in the first 6 and 12 months of life was 0.25 and 0.24 per child-year. infants with AOM were colonized more often with pathogenic bacteria overall (P.005), with Haemophilus influenzae (P.001) and with Moraxella catarrhalis (P =.015). nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization by age in subjects with (n = 143, dotted line) and without (n = 168, solid line) URI and AOM Of 413 URI episodes seen by the study group were available in 395 (96%) episodes. bacterial and viral data, obtained within 7 days of URI onset, were available in 395 (96%) episodes. the presence of any virus, M catarrhalis, or S pneumoniae was associated with an increased URI risk. no RSV, M catarrhalis 177 45 1.33 (1.08\u20131.63) ref \u2014 RSV, no M catarrhalis 15 4 1.73 (1.15\u20132.60) 1.30 (0.85\u20132.00) ref RSV and M catarrhalis 15 4 1.24 (0.84\u20131.83) 0.93 (0.62\u20131.40) 0.72 (0.50\u20131.18) no RVb or M catarrhalis 116 29 ref \u2014 \u2014 No RV, M there were 83 (80%) episodes with available bacterial and viral data within 7 days of AOM diagnosis and before antibiotic treatment. the presence of any virus or S pneumoniae significantly increased the AOM risk, compared with no pathogens. the presence of M catarrhalis, RSV, or both increased AOM risk, compared with neither. environmental and genetic factors associated with URI and AOM risks are shown in Tables 5 and 6. 20 0.84 (0.75\u20130.93).0012 TNF308 polymorphismh 81 1.19 (0.69\u20131.01)063 IL-6\u2013174 polymorphismh 127 1.06 (0.89\u20131.27).50 CI, confidence interval a Any smoking in the household. b The length 6 mo was chosen because it optimized the model fit to the data (ie, maximize the likelihood) polymorphismh 81 0.71 (0.49\u20131.03).069 IL-6\u2013174 polymorphismh 127 0.79 (0.55\u20131.15).23 CI, confidence interval a Any smoking in the household. the length 3 mo was chosen because it optimized the model fit to the data. ative Incidence n Cumulative Incidence % (CI) % (CI) % (CI) % (CI) 1st mo of life 44 14 (10.7\u201318.5) 0 0.0 4 1 (0.48\u20133.4) 2nd mo 60 33 (28.5\u201339.0) 5 2 (0.68\u20133.8) 3 2 (1.1\u20134.7) 3rd mo 50 50 (44.1\u201355.2) 15 6 (4.2\u20139.8) 6 4 (2.4\u20137.1) 4 143 infants (46%) experienced 180 AOM episodes, all but 2 within 28 days of a preceding URI. the rate of AOM after URI was 21% (178 of 859) nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization by age in subjects with (n = 143, dotted line) and without (n = 168, solid line) AOM in first year of life. number of nasopharyngeal swabs in parentheses is number of nasopharyngeal swabs. is, or S pneumoniae was associated with an increased URI risk. data from this model also suggested significant interactions between M catarrhalis and RSV, RV, and MPV. there was no significant difference detected between cases with RSV, compared with M catarrhalis on URI risk in this subset. tarrhalis 116 29 ref \u2014\u2014 No RV, M catarrhalis 98 25 1.63 (1.25\u20132.13) ref \u2014 RV, no M catarrhalis 87 22 2.58 (1.98\u20133.38) 1.48 (1.14\u20132.19) ref RV and M catarrhalis 94 24 2.51 (1.98\u20133.18) 1.54 (1.16\u20132.04) 0.97 (0.76\u20131.25) no MPVb or M catarrhalis 194 49 no RSV, no M catarrhalis 42 51 18.10 (5.50\u201359.60) ref \u2014 \u2014 RSV, no M catarrhalis 2 2 56.20 (22.1\u2013142.6) 3.10 (1.18\u20134.9) ref RSV and M catarrhalis 8 10 12.70 (4.35\u201337.13) 0.70 (0.29\u20131.73) 0.23 (0.11\u20130.48) CI, confidence interval a With or without other viruses. we analyzed data in the first 6 months of life because all infants were followed until 6 months of age (n = 239 infants);

URI risk was associated with birth after February 2010, exclusive breastfeeding >6 months, increased breastfeeding duration, and increased length of time to exclusive formula feeding. decreased URI risk was associated with birth after February 2010, exclusive breastfeeding >6 months. 18% received 3 doses, 5% received 2 doses, and 3% received only 1 dose. h Homozygous and heterozygous. TABLE 6. Environmental and Genetic Factors Associated With AOM in the First 6 Months (n = 70 Infants) Factor n HR (95% CI) P Cigarette exposure. seventy infants experienced 87 AOM episodes before age 6 months. decreased AOM risk was associated with exclusive breastfeeding >3 months, increased duration of breastfeeding, and increased length of time to exclusive formula feeding. more than 75% of our subjects had developed a URI by age 6 months. URI was diagnosed in 11% and 18% by age 6 months. infants born after 2010 experienced a decreased URI risk but not AOM risk. a recent study of 96 infants 9 months of age also did not find TNF308 and IL-6174 to be associated with AOM susceptibility. previous studies have analyzed associations between viral-bacterial interactions and AOM risk by comparing data from cases with and without AOM. URI was common during infancy and contributed to complications such as AOM, sinusitis, and LRI. prolonged breastfeeding was associated with significant reductions of both URI and AOM."}
