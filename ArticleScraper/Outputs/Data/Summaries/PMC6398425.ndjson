{"summary": "enteroviruses classify into 12 species according to their molecular structure and serotype analysis. five species (E\u2013J) of enteroviruses infect only animals. the remaining seven species of enterovirus can cause various kinds of human diseases. non-structure proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D play pivotal roles in viral infection, viral replication, and innate immune response evasion. EVs 2A result in the shutoff the host RNA and protein synthesis by cleaving the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) EV71 2A and 3C proteases play critical roles in inhibiting the production of IFN and the IFN downstream signaling pathway. the inflammasome pathway is also an integral component of the innate immune response against microbes. five types of inflammasomes have been identified. the NLRP3 inflammasome has been extensively studied. the NLRP3 inflammasome is also involved in EV71 and CVB3 infection. NLRP3 oligomerizes via homotypic interactions between NACHT domains. clusters of ASC protein directly recruit pro-caspase-1 via a CARD-CARD interaction. activated caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. signal I activates NF-B signaling pathway through activation of tumor necrosis factor. the priming of NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated by several factors. the induction of NLRP3 expression during priming is regulated by FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8 (allam et al., 2014; Gurung et al., 2014; Gurung et al., 2014). signal II promotes assembly of ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex. K+ efflux, Ca2+ signaling, reactive oxygen species, nigericin, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal rupture, viroporins, and viral functional proteins have been identified as stimuli. NLRP3 inflammasome signaling is not independent of changes in cytosolic Ca2+. treatment with the mitochondria complex I inhibitor rotenone increases the NLRP3-dependent IL-1 secretion. mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ATP, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) also shown to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation. DHX33, DDX19A, and DDX58 have been reported to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation through combining directly with vRNA to bind to NLRP3. pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling, membrane blebbing, and the disintegration of the cell membrane. the gasdermin family plays a central role in inflammasome signaling and cell pyroptosis. the deficient of GSDMD in ASC-reconstituted RAW264.7 cells impaired IL-1 and IL-18 secretion upon LPS stimulation. the NLRP3 Inflammasome NLRP3 is a member of the NLR protein family. the protein contains an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) the central N-terminal domain of NLRP3 mediates oligomerization and serves as a scaffold protein for inflammasome signal I activates the NF-B signaling pathway through the activation of tumor necrosis factor or PRRs, such as the TLRs and NLRs. signal I is evoked by the recognition of viral RNA by toll-like receptors (TLRs) new research has shown that priming the NLRP3 inflammasome through signal I involves transcription-dependent and post-translation-dependent manners. adaptor MyD88 and downstream kinase IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1) have been identified to active NLRP3 through transcriptional manner. adaptor TRIF and IRAK4 play roles in the post-transcriptional manner. potassium (K+) efflux is thought to be an essential mechanism for ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activity. a reduction in cytosolic K+ is necessary for the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. a reduction in cytosolic K+ is necessary for the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. viroporins such as human rhinovirus (HRV) 2B protein (Triantafilou et al., 2013b), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) SH protein (Triantafilou et al., 2013a), influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein (Ito et al., 2010), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein (Nieto-Torres e pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling, membrane blebbing, and the disintegration of the cell membrane. pyroptosis is believed to protect multicellular host organisms against invasive pathogenic bacteria and microbial infections. caspase-1 autoprocessing occurs normally upon activation. extracellular secretion of both pro-caspase-1 and mature caspase-1 is severely inhibited. intact caspase-1 autoprocessing and IL-1 maturation were also observed. viroporins are a group of virus-encoded proteins that enhance the permeability of host cell membrane. these proteins include IAV M2, IAV PB1-F2, EV 2B, RSV SH, HCV p7, and EV71 3D. EV71 2A Cleaves NLRP3 to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. 3 Pyroptosis Activates caspase-1 Wang et al., 2018a EMCV, PV, and EV71 2B Induces NLRP3 redistribution Ito et al., 2012 HRV 2B Triggers the activation of NLRP3 and NLRC5 inflammation. promazine, an entry inhibitor, and rupintrivir, a replication inhibitor, have been shown to inhibit EV71-induced IL-1 maturation and secretion. treatment with EV71 viral genomic RNA is able to stimulate the expression of pro-IL- by activating NF-B but not affecting the secretion of IL-1. NLRP3-inflammasome-deficient mice show more severe disease than WT mice. NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to CVB3 infection is dependent upon ROS production and K+ efflux. cathepsin B (CatB) has been shown to play an important role in CVB3-induced inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. EMCV 2B protein stimulates the NLRP3 inflammasome by stimulating Ca2+ flux from the ER to the cytosol. EV71 2B protein did not induce the secretion of IL-1 in vitro in a 293T cell system. EV71 regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. there are no evidences that other enteroviral 3D proteins participate in the activation. EV71 regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. EV71 3C can cleave GSDMD at the Q193-G194 pair to produce N1-193-GSDMD. enterovirus infection induces IL-1 secretion and caspase-1 activation in bronchial cells in NLRP3 and NLRC5 dependent manner. NLRP3-inflammasome-deficient mice showed decreased levels of IL-1. EV71-caused symptoms in these-deficient mice were worsen than in wild type mice. NLRP3 inflammasome plays a protective role against EV71 infection. enteroviral 2B protein is a virally encoded viroporin that changes intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and stimulates NLRP3- and NLRC5-dependent inflammasome activation by directly co-localization with NLRP3 and NLRC5 in the Golgi. other picornaviral 2B proteins also induce the redistribution of NLRP3. EV71 2B protein did not induce the secretion of IL-1 in vitro. plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1 and EV71 2B respectively were transfected. the coxsackievirus 2B protein can also form membrane-integral pores. EV71 regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. viral RNA is detected by PRRs and NF-B is activated. EV71 3D protein binds to the LRR domain of NLRP3. NLRP3 inflammasome activates IL-18, another important cytokine. IL-18 is secreted from monocytic THP-1 cells in response to EV71 infection. IL-18 mRNA and protein levels were also increased after EV71-infection. studies suggest serum levels of IL-18 are significantly increased in EV71-infected patients. cytokine responses may play a key in pathogenesis of EV71, a model corroborated by in vivo data from mice. the 3C and 2A proteases cleave NLRP3 protein at residues Q225-G226 and G493-L494 respectively. this cleavage inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in 293T cells bearing an NLRP3 inflammasome that was reconstituted by transfection with plasmids expressing NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1. caspase-1 and caspase-11 cleave GSDMD at the D275-G276 pair. an over-expressed EV71 3C protease associates with GSDMD. this cleavage is also observed in EV71-infected 293T cells in which GSDMD is over-expressed. EV71 3C and 2A proteases cleave NLRP3 protein at residues Q225-G226 and G493-L494, respectively. this cleavage inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in 293T cells bearing an NLRP3 inflammasome that was reconstituted by transfection with plasmids expressing NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1. degradation of NLRP3 and its upstream RIP1/RIP3 protein by its proteinase 3C leads to the inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. 3C Induces the Cleavage of GSDMD Gasdermin D is activated by inflammasome-associated inflammatory caspases, including human caspase-1, human caspase-4, human caspase-5, and mouse caspase-11. SDMD generated by 3C cannot inhibit EV71 production. but it is not clear which of the two cleavage fragment plays a leading role during EV71 infection. the role of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of enteroviruses is unclear.
