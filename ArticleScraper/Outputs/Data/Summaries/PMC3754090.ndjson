{"summary": "the novel rhabdovirus was first identified in association with a small hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. a serum sample was obtained from one patient just before initiation of treatment, and the nearly complete viral sequence was recovered by deep sequencing and de novo genome assembly. rhabdoviruses form a large family of enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Rhabdoviridae) that infect a broad the structure and function of the viral glycoprotein is important for the initiation of the viral life cycle and the establishment of infection within a host. the structure and function of the viral glycoprotein is important for the initiation of the viral life cycle and the establishment of infection within a host. the insect cell lines C7/10 (mosquito) and C6/36 (mosquito) were grown in DMEM supplemented as described above but at 28\u00b0C and with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. the primary cell lines HUVEC (human umbilical vascular endothelium) and HUPEC (human pulmonary vascular endothelium) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, nonessential a tagged version of BASV-G (BASV-G.V5) was generated by addition of the V5 tag sequence to the C terminus of the coding sequence. the fusion loop mutants of BASV-G were generated from the pCAGGS/BASV-G.V5 plasmid by overlap PCR using following primers.

Y94, W137, and N138 were produced by overlap PCR and tested alongside the wild-type BASV-G protein. all proteins were expressed in the pseudotype producer cells, although at different levels, and could be detected in the lysates. no size difference was observed for any of the mutants. glycosidases endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) removes almost all types of N-linked glycans, including high-mannose, hybrid, and bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans. 1.0E+08 transducing units (TU)/ml were achieved with VSV-G on all adherent human cell lines. titers in human kidney 293T cells, human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, and human cervix HeLa cells were slightly lower for BASV-G than for VSV-G titers in human muscle RD cells. human suspension cell lines B-THP, HEL, Jurkat, H9, and THP-1 were infected with VSV-G or BASV-G pseudotypes. titers were calculated based on percentage of GFP reporter-expressing cells at 24 h postinfection. background levels for bald particles lacking the glycoprotein were below 1.0E+04 TU/ml.

CHIKV env-mediated fusion of about pH 5.5 was not affected by preincubation at acidic pH (Fig. 4C) there is speculation about the possible animal reservoir and/or vector harboring BASV (1). cell lines from different species, including mosquito cells, were found to be susceptible to BASV-G-driven infection. cell-cell fusion mediated by the viral glycoproteins VSV-G, CHIKV env, BASV-G, and the BASV-G N138A fusion loop mutant induced at pH 5.0 was measured at a range of different temperatures. this finding is surprising given the high titers of BASV-G pseudotypes obtained in mosquito cells grown at 28\u00b0C. cells expressing the lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, or SIGNR1 were infected with VSV-G, BASV-G, or EBOV-GP pseudotypes. the effect of SIGNR1 expression on EBOV-GP pseudotype infection was less pronounced and led to a 3-fold increase. however, none of the lectins enhanced VSV-G-driven infection to >1.5-fold. the level of infection was determined as a percentage of GFP-expressing cells at 24 h postinfection and is shown as a percentage of infection of 293T control cells. a representative experiment of a total of three experiments was performed in duplicate, and a representative experiment of a total of three experiments is shown. a VSVG/BASV-G pseudotype system allows a comprehensive analysis of the functional features of the BASV-G glycoprotein, as well as serological testing for neutralizing antibodies in human sera, at lower biosafety levels. the function of these additional sequence elements is unknown at present. the function of these additional sequence elements is unknown at present. mutation of the fourth nonaromatic fusion loop residue in BASV-G led to an overall reduction of fusion activity and a shift to a lower pH optimum without complete loss of function. class III fusion proteins exist in a dynamic equilibrium of pre- and postfusion conformations that is driven toward the active state at low pH but allows the protein to return to its inactive state upon neutralization of the ambient pH (8). SV-G pseudotype infectivity on a number of cell lines from different species and tissues revealed a broad tropism of BASV-G similar to that of VSV-G. this suggests various cell types from different species are susceptible to BASV-G-mediated infection and therefore likely express a conserved receptor (or group of receptors) used by BASV-G to initiate target cell entry. enveloped viruses have evolved to mask their envelope proteins by glycosylation. the addition of glycans protects the virus from recognition by the host's immune system. this can have important implications for the route of transmission used by a virus to enter a new host. the pseudotype system described in this study will be a practical tool to determine the seroprevalence and clinical relevance of BASV infection. it could explain its suspected clinical manifestation of acute hemorrhagic fever in humans."}
