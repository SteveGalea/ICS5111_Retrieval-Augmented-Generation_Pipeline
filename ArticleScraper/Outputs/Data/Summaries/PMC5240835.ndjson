{"summary": "autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation pathway. it involves sequestration of cytoplasmic components within a transient double-membrane vesicle. autophagy occurs constitutively at basal levels but is further induced in response to various types of stress. highlights include autophagy-mediated degradation of cytoplasmic RNA granules and retrotransposons, ribosomes and associated rRNA (rRNA), RNA-protein aggregates and viral RNA. RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can also act as regulators of the autophagy process. RNA viruses can utilize phagophore and/or autophagosome membranes as viral replication hubs. RNA degradation in the vacuole/lysosome can occur via the RNASET2 family. additional recruitment of RNA directly to the lysosome may occur via an RNA-binding domain in the cytosolic region of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2C. autophagy-dependent RNA catabolism is involved in the maintenance of cellular RNA homeostasis, regulation of translational fidelity, evolutionary tempering of genomic change and protection against human disease. RNA metabolism, including the synthesis, processing, folding, modification and degradation of RNA molecules, is a complex and tightly controlled process, which ensures proper execution of gene expression. RNA degradation by autophagy is far less explored. autophagy provides an additional mechanism of cytoplasmic RNA decay. rRNA and tRNA are highly structured and extensively bound within ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. early observations of stimulus-dependent differences in the rates of RNA vs. protein degradation by autophagy indicated an aspect of selectivity in this process. acid RNases comprise a group of highly conserved endonucleases found broadly in most organisms including plants, yeast and animals. tRNA, rRNA and likely additional types of RNA (RNA X) are degraded in vacuoles/lysosomes by the RNASET2 family. tRNA, rRNA and likely additional types of RNA (RNA X) are degraded in vacuoles/lysosomes by the RNASET2 family. rny1 orthologs have been identified as key enzymes for rRNA degradation in plants and animals. this degradation pathway is abrogated in cells defective for nonselective autophagy including atg7, atg2 and atg17 mutants. deletion of genes responsible for degradation does not have an impact on the autophagic process itself. the authors showed that 18S and 28S rRNAs display a substantially increased half-life in mutants lacking RNS2 relative to wild-type plants. RNA-specific staining indicated that much of this rRNA accumulates in the plant vacuoles; thus, the functional similarities between plant RNS2 and yeast Rny1 are striking. loss-of-function mutations in RNASET2 in humans leads to familial cystic leukoencephalopathy. lysosomal dysfunction caused by rRNA accumulation would eventually impair the autophagy pathway, limit the cellular recycling capacity and ultimately be detrimental to the neurons. the distribution of RNAse T2 enzymes in other cellular compartments has been described. RNAse T2 enzymes can be secreted to the extracellular space where they can influence the surrounding microenvironment. however, the potential reuse of the generated RNA metabolites is a plausible scenario. autophagy can specifically target retrotransposon RNA for degradation, thereby preventing retrotransposon insertion in the genome. a retrotransposition reporter assay suggested that degradation of LINE 1 and alu RNA by autophagy can restrict their degree of genomic insertion. LINE 1 and Alu retrotransposition events are known frequent causes of translocations, deletions, inversions and amplifications. a potential tumor suppressive role for autophagy via protection from genomic retrotransposition is an intriguing possibility. autophagy and viral RNA Autophagy has a well-established role as an intracellular pathogen defense mechanism. RNA viruses can subvert the host cell machinery for autophagosome formation to favor their own replication. the correlation between proficient autophagy and increased viral yield is seemingly inconsistent with the established role for autophagosomes in antiviral defense through viral clearance. a protein localized at the lysosome, SIDT2 (SID1 transmembrane family member 2), was recently shown to bind LAMP2C and contribute to lysosomal RNA uptake. RNautophagy resembles chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a specific type of autophagy occurring in mammalian cells. lysosomal/vacuolar proteins with suggested RNA-binding capacity would be conceivable candidates for novel RNautophagy receptors. other autophagy-related proteins have also been suggested to possess RNA-binding capacity including the mammalian Atg8 homolog and key autophagy protein MAP1LC3B/LC3B. independent studies propose interesting properties of the LC3B protein, which may regulate and/or be regulated by RNA molecules. there are 2 unique ubiquitin-like protein conjugation reactions that are indispensable for autophagosome formation. ribosomes can be selectively turned over in a process called ribophagy. ubiquitin protease Ubp3 and its cofactor Bre5 are specifically required for 60S. ribosomal subunits are more rapidly degraded than other cytoplasmic components. bp3-Bre5-dependent starvation-induced ribophagy97,98. expression of Rkr1 is inhibited by nitrogen starvation. the small (40S) ribosomal subunit is recruited to the phagophore. mechanisms contributing to 60S and 40S ribophagy in yeast are mechanistically distinct, underscoring the existence of cargo-specific regulation. ribosomes are also observed in mammalian autophagosomes, where their degradation by autophagy occurs with different kinetics than that of other cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. a high-throughput screen in S. cerevisiae recently identified Ubp3-Bre5 as a regulator of mitophagy. the ability of this complex to regulate Atg19 ubiquitination status suggests a role in the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway. ribosome biogenesis and protein translation are among the most energy-consuming cellular processes. 'clearing the system' to avoid pathological consequences is also important. autophagy may also act as a response mechanism to promote survival in the face of ribosomal stress, as demonstrated in a zebrafish model. yeast cells seem to lose a substantial fraction of their ribosomes upon starvation, but not all ribosomes are lost. selection mechanisms exist to maintain some ribosomes, either important for translation of selected mRNAs throughout the starvation period or required to facilitate renewed growth upon replenishment of nutrients. processing bodies and SGs are the best-described cytoplasmic RNP granules. PBs contain mostly mRNA decay factors and translation repressors. repressed mRNAs can re-enter the translation cycle. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy, which must be finely tuned due to its physiological importance for cellular viability. proteotoxic stress strongly inhibits translation initiation by phosphorylation of EIF2A/eIF2 inducing SG assembly. the translation of mRNAs harboring a terminal oligopyrimidine tract at their 5\u2032end are particularly sensitive to MTOR inhibition and thus highly affected by various autophagic stimuli. RNA metabolism, including the synthesis, processing, folding, modification and degradation of RNA molecules, is a complex and tightly controlled process. these canonical RNA decay pathways rely on ribonucleases, RNA helicases and other RBPs, which regulate specificities of decay. cellular RNA, including rRNA and tRNA, is highly structured and extensively bound within ribonucleoprotein complexes, rendering them less accessible to the canonical RNA degradation machinery. ncRNA decay via the autophagy-lysosome pathway has received increasing attention in recent literature. pioneering studies from the 1980s\u20131990s laid some initial groundwork in this research field. the RNase T2 family catalyzes the endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded RNA through 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate intermediates. the cellular localization of T2 type RNases is restricted to acidic cytoplasmic compartments, such as vacuoles in yeast and plants, and lysosomes in mammalian cells. tRNA, rRNA and likely additional types of RNA (RNA X) are degraded in vacuoles/lysosomes by the RNASET2 family. the yeast RNase T2, Rny1, cleaves RNA to 3\u2032 nucleotide monophosphates (3\u2032NMPs), which are further converted to nucleosides by the vacuolar phosphatase Pho8. rny1 orthologs have been identified as key enzymes for rRNA degradation in plants and animals. this degradation pathway is abrogated in cells defective for nonselective autophagy including atg7, atg2 and atg17 mutants. deletion of genes encoding enzymes responsible for degradation do not have an impact on autophagic process itself. authors hypothesize that tRNA turnover is a consequence of autophagic targeting of either tRNAs themselves or t authors suggest a compensatory mechanism triggered by lack of proper RNA recycling. accumulated rRNA could serve as a feedback signal to induce bulk autophagy. the putative sensors of such mechanisms remain unidentified. rRNA accumulation in the lysosomes of neurons is likely cause of disease symptoms. rRNA accumulation would impair the autophagy pathway, limit the cellular recycling capacity and ultimately be detrimental to the neurons. the contribution of RNA aggregation to neuronal disease is well known. these findings clearly indicate the existence of additional functions for this RNase family other than lysosomal/vacuolar RNA degradation. the potential reuse of the generated RNA metabolites for de novo RNA synthesis or other purposes is a plausible scenario. this suggests the lack of an efficient RNA recycling system. a retrotransposition reporter assay suggested that degradation of LINE 1 and Alu RNA by autophagy can restrict their degree of genomic insertion. it was shown that LINE 1 RNA colocalizes with processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) these cytoplasmic RNA granules are targeted for autophagic degradation. autophagy and viral RNA Autophagy has a well-established role as an intracellular pathogen defense mechanism. this involves a selective type of autophagy coined \u2018xenophagy\u2019, because it causes removal of foreign material. RNA viruses including polio, dengue, measles, influenza and hepatitis C viruses can utilize autophagosomes or similar cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles to enhance their own RNA replication the correlation between proficient autophagy and increased viral yield is seemingly inconsistent with the established role for autophagosomes in antiviral defense through viral clearance. the pro- and anti-viral roles for autophagy in RNA virus infection will ultimately be influenced by differences in host cell and virus types. some RNA viruses may be degraded by autophagy, others may disrupt lysosomal function or prevent autophagosome-lysosome fusion. a protein localized at the lysosome, SIDT2 (SID1 transmembrane family member 2), was recently shown to bind LAMP2C and contribute to lysosomal RNA uptake. the potential selectivity for RNA subtypes, which could be mediated via interaction with the identified RBPs, would be interesting to study further. recent studies have identified some lysosomal/vacuolar proteins as putative RNA binders. this includes the CMA effector itself, HSPA8, which targets CMA substrates to the lysosomal membrane,10,78,79 and the yeast H+-translocating vacuolar-type ATPase subunit Vma1.80 These and potentially other lysosomal proteins with suggested RNA-binding capacity would be conceivable candidates for novel RN conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 and conjugation of LC3 and other Atg8 homologs to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is dependent on the E1-like and E2-like enzymes, respectively.89,90 ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugates are further associated with ATG16L1 to form a large multimeric complex required for phagophore elongation. tRNA, rRNA and likely additional types of RNA (RNA X) are degraded in vacuoles/lysosomes by the RNASET2 family. the yeast RNase T2, Rny1, cleaves RNA to 3\u2032 nucleotide monophosphates (3\u2032NMPs), which are further converted to nucleosides by the vacuolar phosphatase Pho8. y1 orthologs have been identified as key enzymes for rRNA degradation in plants and animals. this degradation pathway is abrogated in cells defective for nonselective autophagy including atg7, atg2 and atg17 mutants. deletion of genes encoding enzymes responsible for degradation do not have an impact on autophagic process itself. authors hypothesize that tRNA turnover is a consequence of autophagic targeting of either tRNAs themselves or tRNA- rRNA accumulation in lysosomes, particularly in neurons, leads to familial cystic leukoencephalopathy. rRNA accumulation in lysosomes, particularly in neurons, is triggered by lack of proper RNA recycling via autophagy. the contribution of RNA aggregation to neuronal disease is well known. if the RNA accumulation itself provides a triggering signal for the induction of autophagy, it will be interesting to identify the RNA sensors. autophagic degradation of RNA in yeast results in excretion of nucleobases into the environment. this suggests the lack of an efficient RNA recycling system. however, it seems that the cells have alternative means of getting rid of potentially harmful RNA digestion products. a retrotransposition reporter assay suggested that degradation of LINE 1 and Alu RNA by autophagy can restrict their degree of genomic insertion. a potential tumor suppressive role for autophagy via protection from genomic retrotransposition is an intriguing possibility. a potential tumor suppressive role for autophagy via protection from genomic retrotransposition is an intriguing possibility. RNA Autophagy has a well-established role as an intracellular pathogen defense mechanism. phagophores (the precursor to autophagosomes) can engulf infectious pathogens such as virus and bacteria. this involves a selective type of autophagy coined \u2018xenophagy\u2019. RNA viruses may be degraded by autophagy, others may disrupt lysosomal function, prevent autophagosome-lysosome fusion or perhaps, as poliovirus, acquire some resistance to low pH and lysosomal hydrolases. the concept of RNautophagy was characterized by Fujiwara and colleagues. a protein localized at the lysosome, SIDT2 (SID1 transmembrane family member 2), was recently shown to bind LAMP2C and contribute to lysosomal RNA uptake. the potential selectivity for RNA subtypes, which could be mediated via interaction with the identified RBPs, would be interesting to study further. some lysosomal/vacuolar proteins have suggested RNA-binding capacity. this includes the yeast H+-translocating vacuolar-type ATPase subunit Vma1.80. other autophagy-related proteins have also been suggested to possess RNA-binding capacity. ribosomes have been detected inside autophagosomes by electron microscopy. ribosomes can be selectively turned over in a process called ribophagy. ribosomes can be selectively turned over in a process called ribophagy. Kraft and colleagues identified the ubiquitin protease Ubp3 and its cofactor Bre5 to be specifically required for 60S but not 40S ribophagy. starvation in ubp3 and bre5 cells triggers a clear accumulation of 60S ribosomal proteins, while these cells remain proficient in sensing starvation and triggering general autophagy. potential receptors at the phagophore responsible for ribosome recognition remain unknown. more recently, it was found that the E3 ligase Rkr1/Ltn1 can inhibit 60S ribosomal subunit ribophagy by ubiquitination of Rpl25, and that its action is antagonized by Ubp399. mammalian cells have shown specific localization of the small but not the large ribosomal subunit to SGs,100,101 suggesting the 40S subunit route to phagophores may occur via SG intermediates. ribosomes are also observed in interior of mammalian autophagosomes, where their degradation by autophagy occurs with different kinetics than that of other cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. ribophagy has been assigned a role in proteasome degradation via autophagy. ribosome biogenesis and protein translation are among the most energy-consuming cellular processes. ribosomes constitute about 50% of all cellular proteins along with the vast majority of cellular RNA. gene mutations leading to defects in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis cause severe defects in intestinal, liver, pancreas and craniofacial development. in yeast exposed to various conditions of stress or aging, the 25S and 5.8S rRNAs are extensively degraded and that the degradation intermediates differ slightly dependent on the conditions. this finding substantiates the important point that cells are appropriately equipped with ribosome degradation response mechanisms. ribosomes are translationally competent and can efficiently reassemble onto mRNA upon exit from quiescence by nutrient readdition. additional mechanisms contributing to ribosome turnover exist, including the RNA exosome and other nucleases. repressed mRNAs can re-enter the translation cycle, if needed, allowing cells to rapidly respond to changing conditions.124 Granulophagy SGs and PBs, together with their associated RNA, are cleared by autophagy in a process coined granulophagy54-56. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy. this is complicated by the fact that many types of cellular stress can modulate translation and thereby also RNA metabolism through several mechanisms. autophagy-lysosome system likely includes visualization of RNA, ribosomes and RNA granule components within autophagosomes and lysosomes/vacuoles. ribosomes have been detected inside autophagosomes by electron microscopy. ribosomes can be selectively turned over in a process called ribophagy. a catalytically inactive Ubp3 cannot rescue the ribophagy defect. this process is ubiquitin dependent, likely through direct conjugation of ubiquitin to the ribosomal subunits themselves. subsequent studies have led to the identification of additional players in this process. ubiquitination site in Rpl25, K74/75, was identified as a target of Rkr1. expression of a ubiquitination-resistant Rpl25 protects the 60S subunit from starvation-induced degradation. ribosomal subunits or associated factors are protected from autophagic degradation by ubiquitination by ubiquitination. degradation by autophagy occurs with different kinetics than that of other cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. the role of G3BP1 in SG formation combined with recent findings describing SG clearance by autophagy presents obvious links to closely related processes. ribosomes constitute about 50% of all cellular proteins along with the vast majority of cellular RNA, namely rRNA,108. this assigns an especially important role for ribophagy in rapid adjustment of both the number and quality of ribosomes during conditions of stress and upon changing metabolic needs. 8S rRNAs are extensively degraded and that the degradation intermediates differ slightly dependent on the conditions. this finding substantiates the important point that cells are appropriately equipped with ribosome degradation response mechanisms. it is of interest to further investigate links between autophagy and different types of RNA damage. autophagy inhibits rapamycin, a potent inducer of autophagy. a rapid decrease in the existing ribosome pool is in fact not appreciably affected. this seems to be dependent on the RNA exosome function, which is important for the degradation of rRNA from the large ribosomal subunit. yeast atg mutants shows increased accumulation of cytoplasmic RNA granules when blocking late steps of autophagy. autophagy is required for efficient removal of P granules in the C. elegans germline. autophagy is dependent on adaptor protein SEPA-1, which mediates interaction between P granules and LGG-1 (an Atg8 homolog) eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy, which must be kept finely tuned due to its physiological importance for cellular viability. mitophagy, 131 reticulophagy and nucleophagy132 are the best-described cytoplasmic RNP granules. processing bodies and SGs are the best-described cytoplasmic RNP granules. repressed mRNAs can re-enter the translation cycle. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy, which must be kept finely tuned due to its physiological importance for cellular viability. eukaryotic cells are equipped with a robust means of SG clearance via autophagy. autophagy-modulated changes can modulate translation and thus RNA metabolism through several mechanisms. proteotoxic stress strongly inhibits translation initiation by phosphorylation of EIF2A/eIF2 inducing SG assembly. mRNAs harboring a terminal oligopyrimidine tract at their 5\u2032end are particularly sensitive to MTOR inhibition and thus highly affected by various autophagic stimuli. the human RBP proteome is estimated at 1542 RBPs. this is equal to 20% of the mass of the human proteome. this is exemplified in a recent study where global changes in RNA-protein networks were observed upon nitrogen and glucose starvation. LRPPRC interacts with ubiquitin ligase and mitophagy regulator PARK2. LRPPRC interacts with the ubiquitin ligase and mitophagy regulator. LRPPRC interacts with the ubiquitin ligase and mitophagy regulator PARK2. orb protein recognizes cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in RNA. recruits major cellular deadenylase complex CCR4-NOT to dampen Atg mRNA levels. proteins from the ELAV/Hu family can upregulate SQSMT1 and ATG5 mRNAs. in nonstarved conditions, TOR increases decapping via phosphorylation of Dcp2. TOR inactivation prevents Dcp2 phosphorylation causing dissociation of Dhh1 from its RNA substrates. this mechanism is conserved as the mammalian DDX6 suppresses autophagy through a similar mechanism in mouse embryonic stem cells and human HeLa cells. orb associates with PBs that respond to nutrient stresses123. ELAVL1/HuR is a potent proteasomal target, which is stabilized upon proteasome inhibition, resulting in increased SQSTM1 mRNA and protein levels in ARPE-19 cells153. TARDBP regulates splicing of neuron development- and neurological disease-associated mRNAs, including autophagy-related ATG7 and SQSTM1 transcripts. the reverse is observed when TARDBP levels are low, resulting in a decrease of the motor protein DCTN1/Dynactin 1 and a consequential block in autophagosome fusion. miRNAs affecting upstream or indirect regulators of autophagy signaling are not covered in this review. a few examples of well-characterized miRNAs affecting core autophagy components are not covered in this review. somes, fusion and endosomal crosstalk LAMP1, LAMP2 Mir207, MIR320a 243,192 RAB11A Mir21 244 SUMF1 MIR95 190 Concerted regulation of an autophagy/lysosomal transcriptional program is mediated via TFEB. this translocates to the nucleus upon nutrient stress and activates a large set of genes related to lysosome and autophagosome biogenesis. TG4D have been identified as targets for MIR376b174 and MIR101,171 respectively. LC3A and LC3B are both targets of MIR204,186,187. fewer studies have unveiled important miRNA functions at later stages of the autophagy pathway. long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of biological pathways and act through a very diverse set of mechanisms. one such mechanism is buffering of miRNA-mediated repression, where a lncRNA competes for binding to a particular miRNA or set of miRNAs, thereby relieving cognate mRNA targets197. lncRNA Chast is upregulated in a mouse model for cardiac hypertrophy. PLEKHM1 regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by acting as an adaptor protein. lncRNAs can influence cellular pathways by direct binding to effector proteins. many of the cellular stresses, which inhibit NMD, are strong inducers of the autophagy pathway. inhibition of NMD components UPF1 and UPF2 results in increased autophagic flux, implicating a role for autophagy as an adaptive/protective response mechanism. a genome-wide screen identified proteins that could compensate for loss of FUS activity, including the yeast or human RNA helicases Ecm32 and UPF1. cytoplasmic, disease-associated mutant FUS binds an altered set of RNA targets211 and the use of serially deleted FUS expression constructs. phagy, better known as aggrephagy, is suggested to be a fundamental contributor to the pathology of proteinopathies such as ALS and FTD21,212. ATPase VCP, aside from key roles in SG dynamics, is also implicated in aggregate clearance via autophagy. failure to remove protein-RNA aggregates can be explained by dysfunction of proteins important for aggrephagy. ALS-linked FUSR521C mutant causes accumulation of SGs under oxidative stress. SGs colocalize with LC3-positive autophagosomes and accumulate in autophagy-deficient cells. studies emphasize importance of links between aggregate clearance, autophagy, RNA-binding proteins and the maintenance of RNA quality control. at present, the human RBP proteome is estimated at 1542 RBPs. this is equal to 20% of the mass of the human proteome. this is exemplified in a recent study where global changes in RNA-protein networks were observed upon nitrogen and glucose starvation. LRPPRC is reported to suppress autophagy via binding to BECN1 and BCL2. Upon mitophagic stress, the interaction between LRPPRC and BECN1 can be impaired by BST2/tetherin. LRPPRC interacts with ubiquitin ligase and mitophagy regulator PARK2. mRNAs are mediated via Dhh1/DDX6 and Dcp2/DCP2. the orb protein recognizes cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in RNA. it recruits the major cellular deadenylase complex CCR4-NOT to dampen Atg mRNA levels. regulation depends on the RNA helicase Dhh1,147 which recruits ATG mRNAs to the decapping enzyme Dcp2. in nonstarved conditions, TOR increases decapping via phosphorylation of Dcp2. Conversely, upon starvation, TOR inactivation prevents Dcp2 phosphorylation causing dissociation of Dhh1 from its RNA substrates. this mechanism is conserved, as the mammalian Drosophila Atg mRNAs contain CPE regions and associate with orb. orb associates with PBs that respond to nutrient stresses123. ELAV/Hu protein family is positive regulators of mRNA stability and translation. TARDBP regulates splicing of neuron development- and neurological disease-associated mRNAs, including autophagy-related ATG7 and SQSTM1 transcripts.156-159 Recently, Rptor/Raptor mRNA has also been reported as a TARDBP target160. RISC induces posttranscriptional repression of target mRNAs via direct translational repression and transcript destabilization through deadenylation164,165. miRNAs affecting upstream or indirect regulators of autophagy signals are not covered in this review. MIR143 239-241 ATG9 Mir34a 242 Lysosomes, fusion and endosomal crosstalk LAMP1, LAMP2 Mir207, MIR320a 243,192 RAB11A Mir21 244 SUMF1 MIR95 190 Concerted regulation of an autophagy/lysosomal transcriptional program is mediated via TFEB. this translocates to the nucleus upon nutrient stress and activates a large set of gene encoding Atg8 homologs have been identified as miRNA targets. LC3A and LC3B are both targets of MIR204,186,187 respectively. miRNA profiles in atg5 knockout and wild-type cells differ widely following starvation,193. key miRNA processing enzyme DICER1 and main effector molecule AGO2 are targeted for degradation by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway via the selective autophagy receptor CALCOCO2.194-196. microRNA Posttranscriptional regulation of autophagy via miRNAs has been widely documented to have an impact at several stages of the autophagy pathway. ophore elongation ATG5 MIR30a, MIR181a, MIR224-3p 177-179 ATG12 MIR23b, MIR30b, MIR200b 180-182 ATG7 MIR17, Mir188-3p, MIR375 183-185 ATG3 MIR155, Mir495 233,234 ATG16L1 Mir20a, MIR106a, MIR142-3p 235-237. ase M has previously reported several miRNAs affecting autophagic flux and identified MIR101 as an inhibitor of early stages of the autophagy pathway via repression of ATG4D, RAB5A and STMN1.171. numerous papers have demonstrated the impact of miRNA on the autophagy pathway both in early regulatory complexes. miRNA inhibition disrupts lysosomal function and blocks autophagy-mediated degradation in a lysosomal storage disorder. miRNAs affect autophagy, but the opposite regulatory route is evident. the level of Mir188-3p was downregulated during myocardial injury. lncRNA APF (autophagy-promoting factor) was identified and characterized to act as a molecular \u2018sponge\u2019 for Mir188-3p. lncRNA Chast is upregulated in a mouse model for cardiac hypertrophy. AMPK is a well-characterized regulator of autophagy144 and NBR2 deficiency results in lowered ULK1 phosphorylation, compromised GFP-LC3 puncta formation and reduced SQSTM1 degradation. many of the cellular stresses, which inhibit NMD, are strong inducers of the autophagy pathway. RNA-binding proteins, aggrephagy and disease TARDBP and FUS are linked to neurological diseases, including the previously mentioned TARDBP, as well as FUS (FUS RNA binding protein), HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA1, ATXN1 (ataxin 1), ATXN2, TIA1 (TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein) and FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1). cytoplasmic, disease-associated mutant FUS binds an altered set of RNA targets211. the use of serially deleted FUS expression constructs demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal regions, including RNA-binding domains, are required for toxicity. some of the above-mentioned clearance-related proteins have been recently identified as putative RBPs10,78. this is suggestive of complex regulatory feedback mechanisms where these proteins affect their own cellular fate. stress-granules and aggregation Evidence suggests that SGs themselves may transition, over time, to larger ubiquitinated aggregates. autophagy induction may exacerbate pathological phenotypes. boosting autophagosome formation would, on the contrary, have highly unfavorable consequences. many canonical RBPs are linked to neurological diseases. a genome-wide screen identified proteins that could compensate for loss of FUS activity. cytoplasmic, disease-associated mutant FUS binds an altered set of RNA targets211. the use of serially deleted FUS expression constructs demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal regions are required for toxicity. failure to remove protein-RNA aggregates can be explained by dysfunction of proteins important for aggrephagy. some of the above-mentioned clearance-related proteins have been recently identified as putative RBPs10,78. this is suggestive of complex regulatory feedback mechanisms where these proteins affect their own cellular fate. induction of autophagosome formation may exacerbate pathological phenotypes. in such situations, boosting autophagosome formation would have highly unfavorable consequences. emerging knowledge has established many interesting connections between the RNA and autophagy research fields. key autophagy proteins such as LC3B and LAMP2C can themselves bind to RNA, the precise implications of which will require further investigation. major ongoing quests within both the RNA and autophagy fields will provide further insight into these unanswered questions. the authors wish to thank Christian Kroun Damgaard for critical reading of the manuscript. the manuscript is supported by funding from the People Program."}
