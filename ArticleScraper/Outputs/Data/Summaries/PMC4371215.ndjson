{"summary": "bats are distributed widely in the world, occurring on all continents, except Antarctica. they are the second most widespread order of mammals, surpassed only by Primates due to the wide distribution of humans. among mammals, bats are second only to rodents in species richness. Phyllostomidae and Thyropteridae occur only in the new world. the evolution of flight may have had effects on some aspects of the evolution of the immune system and the metabolism of bats. tropics Insects Noctilionidae (2) Bulldog bats Neotropics Insects; 1 specie feeds on fishes Nycteridae (16) New World leaf-nosed bats Neotropics Animals and plants Pteropodidae (198) Old World fruit bats Old World tropics and subtropics Fruits, nectar, pollen Rhinolophidae (198) insects and droppings can be found on the ground of their night roosts. fruits partially eaten by bats have been used to link bats with emerging zoonotic viruses. images are courtesy of a Pol (Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) bats can live 3.5 times longer, on average, than non-volant placental mammals with similar body size. small rodents live in the wild about one-two years, but a bat with similar body size can live more than 30 years. Species richness increases toward the tropics and in most tropical areas bat diversity is higher than that of any other group of mammals. in the same area, 64 non-volant mammals have been recorded, including 22 rodents, 12 marsupials, 10 carnivores, nine xenarthrans, six primates and five ungulates. fruit eaters, flower feeders, aerial insectivores (those that capture insects in flight), foliage gleaners (capture insects on the ground), carnivores (feed on small terrestrial vertebrates, including birds, frogs and mammals), fish eaters, blood feeders and omnivores. phyllostomids - the fruit bats restricted to the Old World tropics (Old World fruit bats) also include fruit eaters and nectar new world leaf-nosed bats of family Phyllostomidae, including frugivores - the great-eating fruit bat (Artibeus lituratus) (A) with seeds in the fur and the little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) (B), insect eaters - the common big-eared bat (Micronycteris cf. microtis) (C) and the stripe-headed round bats comprise a monophyletic lineage that has evolved within the superorder Laurasiatheria. this superorder also includes the order Lipotyphla (formerly Insectivora), Pholidota (pangolins or scaly anteaters), Carnivora (carnivores), Perissodactyla (pigs, cattle, deer and other odd-toed ungulates) and Artiodacty Yangochiroptera (all other families) are the two most basal lineages recognised within the Chiroptera. a more in-depth overview of the historical classification of Chiroptera is available in the Supplementary data. genus Bat bornavirus b1 Common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus) Bunyaviridae Orthobunyavirus Catu Thomas\u2019s mastiff bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) Mojui dos Campos Unidentified bat Kaeng khoi Wrinkled-lipped free-tailed bat (Cherephon plicatus) Hantaan Common serotine (Eptesicus serotinus Xuan son Pomona leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros pomona) Phlebovirus Rift Valley fever Peters\u2019 lesser epauletted fruit bat (Micropteropus pusillus) Toscana Kuhl\u2019s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) Malsoor Leschenault\u2019s rousette (R. leschenaultii) Nairovirus Ahun Whiskered syndrome coronavirus Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus) Dicistroviridae Paris dicistrovirus Common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus) Filoviridae Marburgvirus Marburg Egyptian rousette (R. aegyptiacus) Ebolavirus Zaire Hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) Cuevavirus Lloviu Franquet\u2019s usutu Common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus) Tamana bat Common mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii) West Nile Big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) Yellow fever Little epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus labiatus) Yokose Schreibers\u2019s long-fingered bat (Miniopterus schreibersii fuliginosus) Hepac simplexvirus Parixa Thomas\u2019s nectar bat (Lonchophylla thomasi) (Beta-herpesvirinae) unnamed genus Agua preta Gray short-tailed bat (Carollia subrufa) Cytomegalovirus \u2018A cytomegalovirus\u2019 Little brown myotis (M. lucifugus) (Gammaherpesvirinae) menangle black flying-fox (P. alecto) Mumps Epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus sp.)

Nipah virus has been associated with pteropodids and hipposiderids in Thailand. infection had not been previously detected in India. samples obtained during the siliguri outbreak were retrospectively analysed. RNA of henipavirus was detected in urine of pteropodid bats in australia in 2009. but little is yet known about the virus. henipavirus is one that might be studied to develop a human and livestock vaccine. many of the cases were traced back through chains of transmission to a health care worker who had visited Hong Kong. by late April 2003, more than 4,000 SARS cases and 250 SARS-related deaths were reported to the WHO from more than 25 countries. a retrospective study of samples collected for other purposes demonstrated the presence of an alphacoronavirus RNA sequence in an Australian bat captured in 1996. a retrospective study of samples collected for other purposes demonstrated the presence of an alphacoronavirus RNA sequence in an Australian bat captured in 1996. a new study found that bats are a natural source of at least some of the numerous alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus found world-wide. MERS is caused by a CoV called MERS CoV. most MERS patients develop severe acute respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath. all cases of MERS have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. marburg and ebolavirus haemorrhagic fevers - marburg and ebolaviruses - were discovered because they cause severe, often fatal, haemorrhagic diseases in humans and other primates. the origin of the disease was unknown, other than that it was caused by a hitherto unrecognised virus named marburg virus for the city in Germany where the disease was first recognised. in 1976, a series of severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fevers occurred in southern Sudan. a similar disease was observed in humans in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nearly 1,000 km away. this was the first time a human ebolavirus infection had been connected to naturally-infected non-human primates in africa. this was the first time that a human ebolavirus infection had been connected to naturally-infected non-human primates in africa. ebolavirus is genetically distinct from marburgviruses and ebolaviruses. it is the first filovirus detected in Europe that was not imported from an endemic area in Africa. ebolaviral RNA sequences were quite similar to those of the ebolavirus isolated from humans. ebolaviruses circulate in the forests of central africa. this is the ostensible link for an association of bats with Zaire ebolavirus. the outbreak has sickened more than 20,000 people and killed more than 8,000. viraemias were demonstrable in most of these bats within two-three days after infection and persisted for one-two weeks. viraemias were demonstrable in most of these bats within two-three days after infection and persisted for one-two weeks. there are clear differences between bats of different species. bats have been shown to host hundreds of viruses, some of them important pathogens of humans. interest in and studies of the immunological responses of bats has increased. rabies virus has been detected in apparently healthy bats. Papenfuss et al. (2012) assembled transcriptome sequences from immune tissues and cells of black flying-foxes. they identified 18,600 genes, of which 650 (3.5%) corresponded to immune genes. a transcriptome data set of Shaw et al. (2012) representing Jamaican fruit-eating bats differs somewhat from that of Papenfuss et al. the authors isolated a novel -herpesvirus from a long-fingered bat. they found it to be the first virus genome known to encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II homologues. this finding may change the way we view both bats as hosts and viruses as pathogens. the rapid reestablishment of immune responses in bats emerging from hibernation may bring about a severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. more than 200 viruses of 27 families were isolated from or detected in bats of both suborders. a few of these viruses have been responsible for human diseases, including isolated events or disease outbreaks that have resulted in human deaths. viraemia was detected in most bats, but all were asymptomatic for the infection. viraemia was detected in most bats, but all were asymptomatic for the infection. great spear-nosed bats did not develop sufficient viraemia to infect mosquitoes. several viruses and viral sequences identified from bats have been isolated or detected in bat tissues or excreta. this does not prove a relationship between the presence of a virus (or its nucleic acid sequence, albeit a nucleotide sequence is not a virus) and the disease the virus might cause. some of these viruses or viral sequences might have been in food eaten by bats. virus transmission from bats to humans seems reasonably and logically the link to the outbreak of Nipah and Hendra diseases. only animals phylogenetically closer to bats appear as intermediate hosts. horses and pigs link bats and humans. dobson (2006) visited pig farm sites where outbreaks of Nipah virus infections occurred in Malaysia. pigs may have been contaminated by eating fruit that had been partly eaten by bats and passed the virus to humans. there is no reason to believe other mammals, such as primates and carnivores, do not feed on them. the taxonomic and geographic distribution of bats whose viruses have potentially jumped to humans is also noteworthy. there is no direct evidence that New World bats play important roles in the transmission of zoonotic viruses, other than rabies virus, to humans. all new world bats are in the suborder Yangochiroptera. pteropodids, hipposiderids and rhinolophids are in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. the basal divergence between these suborders is almost as old as the divergence of bats and other mammals. bat cell lines derived from tissues of different taxa and strains of laboratory animals need to be established to provide the necessary conditions for in vitro and in vivo experiments. to reduce risks of accidental species introductions and minimise effects of potential accidental releases into the native fauna, we suggest selection of autoctone species (those from the local fauna) as potential models for research in south America. pathogenic agents will be at least minimally understood. wildlife biologists and epidemiologists should work together to develop appropriate management plans to control virus circulation and minimise risks of human infection. only integrative and organised field and laboratory research will provide a useful and satisfactory solution."}
