{"summary": "population-based measures can play a crucial role in preventing and containing the spread of influenza. these measures include both pharmaceutical measures, such as vaccination and taking antiviral drugs, and non-pharmaceutical measures. effective communication requires a detailed understanding of how people perceive and respond to the threat of influenza pandemics. studies conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were mostly cross-sectional. it is difficult to derive temporal changes in risk perception and responsive behavior from these studies because they differ greatly in measuring risk perception and responsive behavior in terms of scope and scoring [27] the public can take a variety of measures to mitigate the impact of an influenza pandemic. they can reduce exposure by practicing social distancing and taking personal protection and hygiene measures. they can induce immunity through virus-specific vaccination. the foregoing measures are all covered in our study. the influenza pandemic broke out in late 2009 and gradually tailed off in 2010. in this event, most of the cases had mild symptoms. the proportion of critical or fatal cases was small. on June 22, there was an outbreak of H1N1 influenza in an elementary school in a southern city, and a total of 30 cases were confirmed. clinical trials of the H1N1 vaccine were conducted in July and August. beginning on September 10, the H1N1 vaccine was administered to students and the elderly over 60. survey questions on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward an influenza pandemic were covered in the three surveys. key questions were borrowed from the questionnaire design of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, which was used for similar purposes. respondents were asked about the degree to which they took the measures. the respondents were asked about the degree to which they took the measures. the respondents were asked about the degree to which they took the measures. the effective samples of 507, 508 and 1006 respondents were obtained. the refusal rates were 90.01%, 87.37%, and 91.10%. independent-sample t-test was performed to examine how the public\u2019s perceived risk to themselves, their immediate family members, and the community differed. survey questions on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward an influenza pandemic were covered in the three surveys. key questions were borrowed from the questionnaire design of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, which was used for similar purposes. responsive behavior questions covered hygiene and personal protective practices, social distancing measures, information-seeking behavior, and pharmaceutical interventions. respondents were asked about the degree to which they took the measures, with \u201c1\u201d representing \u201cnot at all\u201d and \u201c5\u201d representing \u201ccompletely\u201d and \u201c6\u201d representing \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. knowledge on the status of the spread of H1N1 influenza was inquired in the two 2009 surveys. a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system was used to implement the surveys. the people who answered the phone was explained the nature of the survey and asked for their consent. totals of 12989, 10060, and 19906 dials were made, 5076, 4023, and 11301 dials were answered. 379 (37.67%) 40\u201349 86 (16.96%) 62 (12.20%) 138 (13.72%) 50\u201359 69 (13.61%) 101 (19.88%) 120 (11.93%) >60 55 (10.85%) 99 (19.49%) 55 (5.47%) Nonresponse 14 (2.76%) 0 0 Highest education level Elementary school 29 (5.72%) 17 (3.35%) 25 (2.49%) Junior high school 71 (14.00%) 84 (16. 2.08 2.30 2.69 t(970) = -3.50, p0.01 t(1396) = -7.69, p0.01 Q3. how likely do you think it is that your family would experience financial difficulties once the flu permeated your community. how likely do you think it is that you would be unable to obtain necessary medicines for preventing or treating the flu once it permeated your community. the scores for perceived risk of infection to self and immediate family members increased significantly, from 1.82 and 2.08 to 2.34 and 2.30 (t(975) = -8.20, p0.01; t(970) = -3.50, p0.01) and then to 2.74 and 2.69 (t(1402) = -7.25, p0.01) and then to 3.10 (t(1426) = -4.12, p0.01) and then decreased significantly when influenza broke out massively 91.1%, 83.4% and 2.4% of respondents prepared thermometers, medications to treat fever, and Tamiflu at home. 21.5% of the respondents received seasonal flu shots. most people ventilated their apartments and workplaces, washed their hands with soap and running water. fewer than 62.0%, 51.0%, and 44.0% of the respondents purchased antivirals, received seasonal flu shots, and stockpiled food and water at home. fewer than 62.0%, 51.0%, and 44.0% of the respondents purchased antivirals and received seasonal flu shots.
