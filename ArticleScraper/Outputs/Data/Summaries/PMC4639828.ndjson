{"summary": "there is very limited evidence that SADC plays a role in regional health diplomacy and regional health governance through engagement with regional social policy. there is very limited evidence that SADC plays a role in regional health diplomacy and governance through engagement with regional social policy. this role is primarily played by donors partnered with national governments. regional organisations and regional social policy feature substantially in social policy literature which considers the role of regional organisations as global players and training hubs. regional social policy literature has focused on cross-border redistributive programmes (including employment projects, food programmes and social protection funds), policy harmonisation and provision of services. global health diplomacy has its roots in the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. an amount of US$15.6 billion was committed by 2008 to AIDS activities in 140 countries. the united states also launched the PEPFAR, a 5-year, US$15 billion initiative to fight HIV/AIDS, mostly in Africa. health diplomacy has become critically important for foreign policy, national governments and regional organisations. health diplomacy ensures the involvement of foreign affairs ministries. countries have to address trans-border issues that threaten global stability. middle powers from the global south have the power to challenge the status quo. countries such as Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey can potentially change the global health agenda by reforming as opposed to radically changing what already exists. the role of SADC health governance relates to basic principles of SADC\u2019s origins. each member state took responsibility for a particular sector instead of a regional economic development strategy. the \u2018sectoral responsibility approach\u2019 resulted in decentralisation of the structure and the creation of the secretariat in Gaborone, Botswana. since 1992 and the dissolution of the SADCC, SADC has struggled to find a cohesive approach to regional integration and development. the competition between member states for private sector investment and development interventions has resulted in a regional imbalance. the political economy of development and the political economy of health in the region are largely influenced by donors from the Global North. external funding in the SADC region in 2013 amounted to US$67,600,000 for a total of 58 projects. the regional indicative strategic development plan is said to emulate EU policies of integration and development. donor aid is essential for sustaining regional health policies and systems strengthening. aria (2010) SADC Sexual and Reproductive Health Business Plan (2011\u20132015) SADC Strategic Framework for Control of Tuberculosis in the SADC region (2012) Sexual and Reproductive Health for SADC (2006\u20132015) the draft Declaration on Tuberculosis in the mining sector (2012) The Health Policy Framework (2003) The minimum standards for HIV testing and counselling (2009) The SADC Protocol on health (signed on 18 August 1999) is the driving document behind health in the SADC region. the study emphasises the need for SADC to draw attention to the SDGs to define national policy priorities, review the influence of national policies and address pressures that lead to unsustainable development. effective implementation and achievement of the SDGs will only be advanced by effective coordination of regional organisations. civil society can challenge corporations promoting tobacco, alcohol and obesogenic foods. the role of civil society in public health is attributable to a weakening of state authority as a consequence of globalisation. south africa, as the most powerful SADC state, could lead a civil society initiative to ensure civil society agendas are addressed at inter-ministerial and government levels. the SADC Trade Protocol is viewed as ineffective in eliminating non-tariff barriers (NTBs), which negatively influence trade in the region in general. national macroeconomic policies have increased inequalities in the region. additional inequalities stem from unequal land ownership, distribution and access to resources. despite these efforts, national macroeconomic policies have increased inequalities. health-promoting trade must facilitate equitable outcomes of private and public health services. this will become imminently more possible when SADC strengthens its negotiating power and capacity in trade frameworks. other SADC countries actively use NTBs to block trade, as these countries vie for markets. regional integration efforts, including COMESA, SADC and Southern African Customs Union, have all attempted to liberalise trade to increase bilateral trade flows and diversify exports. Continued attempts to harness regional integration will assist in lowering costs for all countries. this will assist increased access to health and pharmaceutical products. a lack of skilled health professionals results in a non-functional healthcare system at primary levels of care. the move of healthcare workers from lower to higher income countries has resulted in increased international migration, which create further inequities. training for health diplomats could be a hypothetical solution for focused south\u2013South health diplomacy management. training for health diplomats could take place at inter-ministerial meetings and elected diplomatic representatives could benefit from advanced health diplomacy training. t is ideally placed for this role, considering its central location and support role for the 15 member states. South Africa is ideally positioned to create closer ties with Brazil and other emerging middle powers to align common goals for health diplomacy. identifying health as a \u2018pressing foreign policy issue\u2019 calls for recognition of the processes by which the government, multilateral organisations and civil society position health in foreign policy deliberations for health governance. role of civil society must become a priority in the regional organisation to uphold democratic values and to ensure that the health interests of citizens are met. civil society agendas can be promoted by a specific SADC advisory body. civil society agendas can be promoted by a specific SADC civil society advisory body. south africa, as the most powerful SADC state, could lead a civil society initiative to ensure civil society agendas are addressed at inter-ministerial and government levels. health issues, including communicable disease control, drug purchases, health personnel migration, disease surveillance and supply of resources, are being addressed from national, regional and international perspectives. the 1996 SADC Trade Protocol established a free trade area in SADC, implemented in 2008. health-promoting trade must facilitate equitable outcomes of private and public health services. this will become imminently more possible when SADC strengthens its negotiating power and capacity in trade frameworks, challenge global trade regimes which exclude Southern interests. other SADC countries actively use NTBs to block trade, as these countries vie for markets. TBs are low regional trade and resultant poverty in the trading bloc. a renewed focus on the role of the SADC could address the disproportionate distribution of doctors and nurses in developing regions. on the african continent there are a mere 2.3 health workers per 1000 people. the Americas have a ratio of 24.8 workers per 1000. this imbalance is reflected in the high infection and mortality rates across the continent. SADC can act as a regional champion for health personnel and regulation of health personnel in southern africa. there is scope for improving personnel trade, employment and movement. training for health diplomats could also be hypothetical solution for focused south\u2013South health diplomacy management. the SADC Secretariat is ideally placed for this role, considering its central location and support role for the 15 member states. South Africa is in a position to put SADC on the map as far as health diplomacy is concerned. opportunities for SADC are by no means limited to these five recommendations. additional considerations include SADC involvement in the manufacture of generic medicines, acting as a representative to engage with big pharmaceutical companies. SADC can champion the regional generic drugs manufacturing industry, engage with big pharmaceutical companies globally and advocate for the provision of cheaper medicines for impoverished communities. despite the many treaties and protocols in place, SADC is reliant on donors, development aid and external interventions for health governance management. there is little evidence that SADC engages with the international health community as a regional diplomatic power, considering SADC\u2019s reliance on the international health community for support."}
