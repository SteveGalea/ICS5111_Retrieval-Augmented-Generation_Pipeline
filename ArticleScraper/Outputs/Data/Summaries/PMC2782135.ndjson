{"summary": "influenza activity displays a seasonal pattern in temperate areas with marked peaks in the winter, but is present all year round throughout the tropics. sporadic reports from the Gambia [6], Senegal [7], Congo [8], Madagascar [8], Ivory Coast [10], and from Gabon have indicated that influenza is circulating and may be causing epidemics regularly. almost all children had anti-H1N1 HI titers above 40. 40% showed antibodies to influenza B with HI titers of 40 or above. influenza is not distinguishable from most other infectious diseases with fever in the tropics. febrile illnesses in Lambarene are due not only to influenza, but also to dengue fever, chikungunya disease, and streptococcal pneumonia. the problem of diagnosing influenza-like illness is already challenging in resource-rich settings apparent from data collected on the ongoing pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) a well-established research center could be identified to act as a surveillance center. there is a need for identifying new ones in other regions. training should ensure epidemiological data can be gathered on attack rates, clinical spectrum of illness, and risk factors. the antibody response following vaccination to A-H1N1 and B virus strains was significantly lower in rural compared to urban schoolchildren. the clinical relevance of such findings remains unanswered."}
