{"summary": "six criteria are required: universal presence of virus in every diseased host, isolation from hosts, cultivation in pure culture, production of a comparable disease by injecting the virus into a suitable recipient. in 2003, when the new human infectious disease SARS broke out, these criteria helped establish the causal relationship between SARS and SARS-associated coronavirus. unlike infectious diseases, cancer occurrence is a complex and chronic process. inconsistent Epidemiologic Evidence for the Etiological Role of EBV Epidemiology studies provide the primary and essential evidence for the relationship between diseases and their causal agents. most NPC patients have high immunoglobulin A and/or IgG levels against various EBV antigens. emigrants from southern china retain a higher risk of NPC than western populations [18]. the fact of universal EBV infection but specific endemic or racial NPC distribution suggests that nonviral factors such as environmental carcinogens or genetics may play more important roles in NPC initiation than EBV infection. in vitro experiments of EBV infection into established epithelial cell lines have shown that NPC cell lines are initially polyclonal, but this is rapidly followed by the predominance of a clonal pattern. only a small fraction of NPC cells contain the virus in the EBV-positive cells. 145 of 149 cases of invasive NPC and 2 of 4 cases of in situ NPC were positive for EBV DNase. but only 2 of 202 healthy subjects who had elevated EBV antibody levels were DNase-positive. this suggests that EBV infection is not the first event during NPC pathogenesis. LMP1 is considered as the EBV oncogene because it can transform rodent fibroblast cell lines such as Rat-1 [41]. it produces a loss of contact inhibition in Rat-1 cells and causes anchorage-independent growth in both Rat-1 and BALB/c 3T3 cells so they clone with high efficiency in vitro. lack of a Convincing NPC Animal Model Induced by EBV Infection Animal experiments can provide direct information on the relationship between carcinogenic agents and carcinomas. successful examples include Mongolian gerbils infected with H. pylori for studying gastric carcinoma and HBV transgenic mice for studying liver cancer. BV at high titer, the cotton tamarin, the cottontop marmoset and the owl monkey can develop an ill-defined infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome or multiple lymphomas. however, these primate models can not establish a persistent EBV infection, and some of them have cross-species virus infection, suggesting they cannot precisely mimic the human response to EBV infection. the effectiveness of the HBV vaccine in reducing liver cancer will be clear 20 years from now. the most convincing evidence should be the decline of the NPC incidence rate in endemic areas by prevention of EBV infection. mechanistic studies and animal bioassays for role of EBV infection in NPC occurrence weaker than that for lymphomas. fact of universal EBV infection and marked geographic and racial distribution of high-incidence NPC suggest that other co-factors may play more important roles in NPC initiation."}
