{"summary": "epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms. each of these interventions incurs a quantifiable cost: culling results in additional deaths; medical treatments or quarantines result in monetary expenses; vaccination incurs both monetary expenses; and in some cases additional vaccine-induced infections. a key challenge to calculating optimal intervention strategies involves devising ways to characterize and explore the space of intervention policies. most existing work on optimal intervention has required various limiting assumptions about the forms of such strategies. tildesley et al [1] describe optimal vaccination strategies for a foot-and-mouth epidemic. adaptive policies perform similarly to nonadaptive policies based on perfect parameter estimates, and significantly better than nonadaptive policies based on imperfect parameter estimates. adaptive online estimation affords the method some robustness to model misspecification. a population essentially closed to immigration and emigration, recovery with immunity, and nearly homogeneous mixing of susceptibles and infectives. the epidemic conforms to many standard assumptions of SIR models: a population essentially closed to immigration and emigration. the mean total cost after 40 days is 2100 cost units, with quantile bounds (1949,2263). if the number of remaining susceptibles is less than a designated threshold, the vaccination campaign is discontinued. the 95% central interval for the final distribution of total vaccine units dispensed is (339,581) the uncertainty bands widen, representing variations in the costs associated with maintaining the remaining population of infected individuals until their natural recoveries. the mean total cost at time 40 is 1652 cost units, approximately a 21% reduction in total cost compared to no-intervention. adaptive management of an emerging epidemic can be effectively summarized by the disease state of the population and by the SIR model parameters that define the dynamics of transmission, death, and recovery. in most settings it will be natural to regard the transmission model parameters as unknowns to be estimated from incoming count data describing the sizes of the susceptible, infected and recovered subpopulations. compared to Figure 4, the central 95% region associated with the total number of vaccine units dispensed over the course of the intervention is more compact. the tighter bound about a smaller mean is due to the ability of the adaptive strategies to methodically diminish the vaccination campaign as a function of the epidemic state. the mean number of vaccine units dispensed is 428, with quantile bounds (351,536). the mean total cost is 1665 cost units, with quantile bounds (1450,1888). Figure 8. Vaccination levels under adaptive management. the adaptive policy achieves nearly identical costs under model misspecification. the static policy is based on parameter estimates obtained after a completely observed epidemic. the adaptive policy achieves nearly identical costs. adaptive strategies based on on-line estimates produce equivalent outcomes to those static strategies based on full retrospective analyses. static control measures based on reasonable but imperfect parameter estimates can lead to substantially worse outcomes/higher costs than the adaptive policies. assuming a value of 2 cost units per dose of vaccine, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected cost surface associated with variable stop time policies. the minimum expected cost is achieved under a policy of maximum (30%) vaccination and a stopping threshold of 150 individuals. the 95% central interval for the final distribution of total vaccine units dispensed is (339,581) the mean number of vaccine units dispensed is 442, with quantile bounds (339,580). the mean total cost is 1652 cost units, with quantile bounds (1440,1846) the intervention calculated in the previous section represents a gold-standard for this particular scenario. the effectiveness of this approach can be explored by repeated simulation of epidemics under adaptive management. as before, the policy was a static function of the initial disease state and the initial point estimate of each parameter. the fitted model includes a mortality parameter () this allows examination of the degree to which adaptive management strategies are robust to model misspecification. in epidemics associated with the upper 97.5 percentile of vaccination strategies, the adaptive policy calls for 4 rounds of maximum vaccination followed by a round of 20% vaccination followed by a final round of 5% vaccination. the adaptive nature of the interventions enables more efficient use of vaccine resources than achieved under nonadaptive policies. the inference model is misspecified relative to the model being used to simulate the epidemic. the model includes a mortality parameter, even though no deaths were observed in the simulated outbreaks. by coupling policy calculations with an inference framework, the effect of such model misspecification appears to be reduced. the adaptive policy achieves nearly identical costs. 2.5%-ile Mean Median 97.5%-ile Adaptive 1910 2091 2089 2311 Nonadaptive 1888 2085 2085 2295. a monetary valuation scheme is the most straightforward, but it may be difficult to construct such a scheme that adequately represents all aspects of the decision. the cost to be minimized would be the expected total loss of life for the epidemic under a given intervention strategy. monetary constraint to a loss-of-life cost function can be found in the framework presented here. it would be possible to optimize with respect to some selective criterion. this would lead to minimization of costs associated with worst case scenarios rather than that associated with the average case scenario. the negative binomial transmission function implies that disease transmission occurs following a Poisson process in which encounters between infected and susceptible individuals are Poission distributed. the negative binomial transmission function can account for social interactions and/or network factors in disease transmission, without requiring explicit characterization of the population structure. ies and deaths occurring between time t and t+1 can be described by (7) (8) where and The forward dynamics for the total numbers of susceptible and infected individuals are therefore individuals are therefore (9) (10). in all forward simulations of the disease dynamic we assume the \u201ctrue\u201d underlying parameters to be those estimated by Murray [9], with exception of the negative binomial overdispersion parameter k. assuming the initial epidemiological state is the expected total cost of the epidemic under intervention strategy (,) can be expressed recursively as (13) where denotes the expected cost accumulated from time t onwards. the adaptive strategy that emerges is similarly flexible in that it consists of a state-dependent sequence of target fractions, but does not involve the additional computational burden associated with stochastic dynamic programming. the likelihood up to T is given recursively in Equations 6\u20138. SIR Model We consider a standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [10], [12] with no loss of immunity but with mortality. in this model, the dynamic variables at time t are the number of susceptible individuals, S(t); the number of infected individuals, I(t); and the number of recovered individuals, D(t). infected and susceptible individuals are Poission distributed with the encounter rate varying according to a gamma distribution with coefficient of variation. the negative binomial transmission function can account for social interactions and/or network factors in disease transmission, without requiring explicit characterization of the population structure. the SIR model formulation also leads immediately to a natural discrete time approximation for the numbers of infections (, recoveries () and deaths () occurring between time t and t+1. we set the overdispersion parameter to be k = 0.1, in order to produce epidemics that, without intervention, have run their course by 40 time units. we define the total expected cost of the epidemic in terms of the underlying costs associated with maintaining infected individuals until recovery, suffering death, and administering vaccinations. the strategy producing the lowest mean cost is defined to be the optimal intervention. at each time step, MCMC is used to produce 10,000 samples from the current posterior distribution on model parameters. for each of these 100 samples the optimal variable stop time vaccination strategy is calculated as described above. conditional conjugacy can be exploited for and via Beta priors for and. a Beta prior for implies that (15) Conjugate updating leads to the posterior conditional (16) the form of the conditional posterior for is similar to Equation 16 and can be simulated by drawing via Equation 16 and then applying the inverse transformation."}
