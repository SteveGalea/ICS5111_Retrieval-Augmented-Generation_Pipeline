{"summary": "nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs (NS) collected from children compare favorably to NW/nasopharyngeal aspirates for PCR detection of most respiratory viruses. parents- or self-collected swabs are useful for community-based respiratory virus research (6\u201311) foam swabs were initially compared with flocked nylon swabs. no inhibition of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was seen with swab type or transport media. foam NS were collected and transported in dry tubes at room temperature. collection of saline and dry foam swabs was performed 2 to 7 days after initial NW in 10 immunocompetent subjects. subjects were allowed to participate during more than one URI if the URIs were >4 weeks apart. a difference score was coded (i.e., for saline and dry swabs, 1 if saline negative/dry positive, 0 if concordant, and 1 if saline positive/dry negative), and analyzed via linear regression. Sensitivities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via logistic regression models in true-positive samples. a total of 60 swab pairs were negative in both samples; 86 pairs were positive in at least 1 swab, with 2 viruses detected in 2 swab pairs. at least one sample had a respiratory virus detected by either method in 104/142 (73%) illness episodes. 92 immunocompetent subjects with 142 incident upper respiratory infections and 40 HCT recipients with previously diagnosed respiratory virus infections with 140 weekly paired follow-up swabs. 104 pairs were positive in at least 1 swab, with 2 viruses detected in 9 swab pairs and 3 viruses detected in 3 swab pairs. 110 pairs were positive in at least 1 swab with 2 viruses detected in 10 swab pairs. no detections were made for influenza virus A, influenza virus B, and human bocavirus. foam swabs are absorptive and potentially less likely than nylon, dacron, or cotton to induce bleeding in HCT patients with mucositis or thrombocytopenia. saline spray improved performance compared to dry swabs alone. we hypothesize that saline spray may disrupt nasal epithelial cells. Foam NS collected with saline spray increased sensitivity for virus detection compared with dry swabs. we recommend this approach as an alternative to NW for conducting respiratory virus surveillance."}
