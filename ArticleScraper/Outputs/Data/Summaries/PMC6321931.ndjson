{"summary": "apoptosis is one such mechanism of cell death that can be activated by a number of factors, including bacterial and viral infections (1). RIPK1 and RIPK3 possess a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) the interaction leads to the formation of a complex called the necrosome. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 inhibit necroptosis in human cells by encoding ICP6 and ICP10 proteins. vaccinia virus has been reported to induce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-mediated necroptosis in both human and mouse cells. NS1 is able to inhibit double-stranded RNA-mediated protein kinase R (PKR) activation and the resultant IFN- production (22). NS1 interacts with DDX3 and is able to counteract virus-induced stress granule formation and DDX3 localization in these stress granules. the number of IAV-infected cells showing necroptosis increased when apoptosis was inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor QVD. the number of IAV-infected cells showing necroptosis increased when apoptosis was inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor. 549 cell line inducibly expressing human RIPK3 was cultured in the absence or presence of 0.5 g/ml of doxycycline for 12 h. cells were either left untreated or treated with QVD for 1 h and then either mock infected or infected with IAV (PR8) at an MOI of 10. to further confirm that IAV infection induces necroptosis in THP1 cells, we examined the phosphorylation status of M we infected THP1 cells with pandemic influenza A/Halifax/210/2009/H1N1 (Hf09) virus. phosphorylation of MLKL can be observed in cells infected with IAV (Hf09) following pretreatment with QVD albeit at a lower level than with PR8. phosphorylation of MLKL can be observed in RIPK3-expressing cells. it cannot be detected in mock-infected cells regardless of expression of RIPK3. inhibition of RIPK1 by Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) did not inhibit IAV-induced cell death; rather, it enhanced IAV-induced cell death. RIP1, RIPK3, and MLKL are all involved in IAV-induced necroptosis. differentiated THP1 cells were either left untreated or treated for 1 h with the caspase inhibitor QVD (20 M) the cells were either mock infected or infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 5. NS1 protein of IAV interacts with MLKL during IAV infection. hek293T cells were transfected with a flag vector or the p85-Flag plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10. NS1 was coprecipitated readily by MLKL from the cell lysate of infected cells. NS1 could not be detected when normal rabbit IgG was used for IP. coiled-coil domain 2 of MLKL has a predominant role in mediating MLKL interaction with NS1. hek293T cells were cotransfected with each of the flag-tagged MLKL mutant plasmids and the plasmid expressing NS1. at 36 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were collected and subjected to co-IP. CC2 of MLKL has a predominant role in mediating interaction with NS1. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the Flag-tagged plasmid and NS1-expressing plasmid. precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against the Flag tag and NS1 protein. 41 amino acids by alanine in NS1 abolishes its RNA binding ability. at 36 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were collected and subjected to co-IP with the anti-Flag antibody. NS1(R38A/K41A) failed to interact with MLKL (lane 3) NS1 enhances MLKL oligomerization and membrane translocation. coiled-coil domain 2 of MLKL has a predominant role in mediating the interaction with NS1. we used overexpression of MLKL in either the absence or the presence of increasing amounts of NS1 in HEK293T cells. hek293T cells were cotransfected with the Flag-tagged MLKL-expressing plasmid. at 36 h posttransfection, cell lysates were separated into the total, cytoplasmic (C) or membrane (M) fraction. at 8 h p.i., cell lysates were harvested and subjected to assays. NS1 analyzed the oligomerization state and membrane translocation of MLKL. NS1(R38A/K41A) did not interact with MLKL. NS1(R38A/K41A) did not interact with MLKL. interaction of NS1 with MLKL enhances MLKL-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1 processing and secretion. in addition to necroptosis, activated MLKL also causes the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing NLRP3 inflammasome components and pro-IL-1 along with the indicated plasmids expressing null, MLKL, NS1 or NS1(R38A/K41A) the supernatants were collected at 20 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. we stained influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus-infected cells with propidium iodide (PI) at 16 h postinfection (p.i.) cells treated with a combination of TNF-, cycloheximide, and the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH (QVD) were used as a positive control. at 8 h posttreatment, cells were harvested and examined for phosphorylated MLKL. cells were either left untreated or treated with the combination of T/C/Q (TNF-, cycloheximide, and QVD) cells were harvested and examined for RIPK3 and phosphorylated MLKL. phosphorylation of MLKL can be observed in cells infected with IAV following pretreatment with QVD and in cells treated with T/C/Q (lanes 4 and 5) but not in mock-infected or QVD-treated cells (lanes 1 and 2). to examine whether IAV-induced necroptosis in THP1 cells is not specific to PR8 virus, we infected THP1 cells with pandemic influenza. no RIPK3 expression could be detected from A549 cells (lanes 5 to 8) and A549-RIPK3HA cells that were not induced by doxycycline (lanes 1 and 2). phosphorylation of MLKL can be observed in RIPK3-expressing cells that were infected with IAV with or without pretreatment with QVD. inhibition of caspase activity in the absence of a necroptosis inhibitor increased IAV-induced cell death. inhibition of either cell death pathway may skew the cells toward an erroneous mode of cell death. inhibition of either cell death pathway may skew the cells toward an erroneous mode of cell death. hek293T cells were transfected with either a Flag vector, flag-tagged MLKL, or a flag-tagged p85 plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10. differentiated THP1 cells were either mock infected or infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10. Cell lysates were prepared at 8 h p.i. and subjected to IP with either normal rabbit IgG or anti-MLKL antibody. coiled-coil domain 1 (CC1) is responsible for MLKL membrane translocation. coiled-coil domain 2 (CC2) is responsible for the oligomerization of MLKL (4, 6, 26). to delineate the region of MLKL involved in its interaction with NS1 we constructed Flag-tagged plasmids expressing different truncated MLKL mutants. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the Flag-tagged MLKL-expressing plasmid and NS1-expressing plasmid. cell lysates were prepared at 36 h posttransfection and subjected to IP with either normal rabbit IgG or anti-Flag antibody. differentiated THP1 cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10. at 8 h p.i., cell lysates were prepared, treated with RNase A or left untreated, and subjected to IP with either normal rabbit IgG or anti-MLKL antibody. NS1 interacted with MLKL when the cell lysate was not treated with RNase A (lane 2), the NS1-MLKL interaction was abrogated by RNase A treatment (lane 3), indicating that the NS1-MLKL interaction is indeed RNA dependent. NS1 enhances MLKL oligomerization and membrane translocation. most of the MLKL protein detected in the crude membrane fraction was in the oligomer form. the amount of MLKL present in the oligomer form increased when NS1 was concomitantly expressed (lane 4). the amount of MLKL in the membrane fraction increased when NS1 was expressed in increasing amounts (lane 6). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the Flag-tagged MLKL-expressing plasmid and either the WT NS1- or NS1(R38A/K41A)-expressing plasmid. at 36 h posttransfection, cell lysates were harvested and subjected to assays as described above for panel A. more MLKL was present in the oligomer form in the membrane fraction of infected cells than in mock-infected cells. interaction of NS1 with MLKL leads to increased oligomerization and membrane translocation of MLKL. IL-1 secretion increased when NS1 was coexpressed together with constituents of the NLRP3 inflammasome (lane 2). no increase in IL-1 secretion was observed when NS1 or NS1(R38A/K41A) was coexpressed alone with constituents of the NLRP3 inflammasome (lane 2). HEK293T cells were transfected as described above for panel A. IL-1 levels in the supernatants of the above-described samples were measured by an ELISA. results are representative of data from three independent experiments performed in duplicates. the NS1 protein of IAV directly interacts with MLKL. the killer function of MLKL has been attributed to the N-terminal four-helix bundle domain. RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL leads to a conformational change in MLKL. NS1 interacts with MLKL in an RNA-dependent manner. the CC2 region of MLKL is responsible for interacting with NS1. NS1 induces a conformational change in MLKL predisposing it to oligomerization. viruses, including IAV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Zika virus, and dengue virus, have been reported to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (28, 34, 35) the activated NLRP3 inflammasome can be beneficial to the host, as it can lead to an enhancement of antiviral defense. IL-1 secretion and a strong inflammatory response are major factors contributing to Zika virus pathogenicity. a similar association between activation of NLRP3 and increased pathogenesis has been reported for HIV-1 (41), hepatitis C virus (42, 43), and Sindbis virus (44). human embryonic kidney HEK293T and A549 cells were maintained in DMEM.
