{"summary": "3 distinct proteins called IFN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3 have been identified. they are also named interleukin-29 (IL-29), IL-28A, and IL-28B respectively. the receptor for type III IFN is composed of the unique IFN-R1 chain. we have cloned the mouse IFN-s (mIFN-2 and mIFN-3) and IFN- receptor (mIFN-R1) orthologues. mIFN-2 and mIFN-3 signal through the IFN- receptor complex activate ISGF3 and are capable of inducing antiviral protection and MHC class I antigen expression. the intensity of cell signaling as measured by STAT1 activation appeared to be significantly lower for type III IFNs. in contrast to type I IFN-, only restricted cells respond to IFN-. IFN- has the ability to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of blood monocyte-derived macrophages that expressed IFN- receptors [15] and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection of human astrocytes and neurons [16], but in most other cases, the antiviral potency of IFN- against several viruses seems to be lower than that of IFN- [2, 3, 8, 9, 13, 17]. PBMCs upregulated the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. but not IL-1 or TNF, suggesting that IFN-1 activated monocytes. but only moderate effect was observed on IL-4 and IL-15, the other important cytokines in the Th2 response. IFN-3 reduces regulatory T-cell populations. unlike IL-12, IFN-3 reduces regulatory T-cell populations. IFN-3 is able to completely protect mice from death. the ability of IFN-s to induce antiproliferative activity depends on the level of IFN-R1 expression. it has been reported that IFN- signaling in colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29 cells led to caspase activation, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) and DNA fragmentation, resulting in subsequent apoptosis. IFN-mediated cell growth of multiple myeloma cells was MAPK dependent. high level of IFN- was found in the malignant bone marrow microenvironment. a high response to IFN- was observed in the stomach, intestine, heart, kidney, and lung. IFN-R1 is formed by two chain proteins, IFN-R1 and IL-10R2. IL-10R2 is shared by IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26. fibroblasts and endothelial cells were completely unresponsive to IFN-. dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and subdermal adipocytes did not express significant amounts of IFN-R1. the expression of IFN-R1 was significantly high in lymphoid tissues. the IFN- response was very weak, implying specific mechanisms in the lymphoid tissues that may inhibit the IFN- response. IFN- can also be used as a drug carrier, to specifically target a drug to tumors expressing high IFN- binding sites. the availability of IFN-R1 knock-out mice allowed for the investigation of the role of type III IFNs in vivo. pegylated IFN-1 in combination or not with ribavirin has been used in this study to assess the efficacy and potential cytotoxicity. the study was performed in 3 parts. the first part evaluated the pegylated IFN- as single agent for relapsed patients after IFN--based treatment. the second part evaluated the combination of pegylated IFN- and RBV in treatment-nave patients. the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in HCV infection were reported by Ge et al. they evaluated the treatment outcome in a group of 1671 patients of mixed ethnicity receiving pegylated IFN- and ribavirin. the most significant SNP (rs12979860) demonstrating high statistical significance. the IFN response was assessed by measuring the IFN-induced cell signaling (Stat activation) and cell activity (MHC class I antigen stimulation) only restricted cells respond to IFN-, including epithelial-like cells, forming the major organs of the body. ency of IFN- against several viruses seems to be lower than that of IFN-. IFN- and IFN- may induce distinct signal transduction and gene regulation kinetics. the role of IFN- in the immune system is being investigated. this immunoregulatory function was enhanced through the expression of IFN-R1 on CD4+ T cells [23]. findings correlate with data suggesting that IFN- may have an immunoprotective role against asthma, the allergy disease caused by an exaggerated Th2 response. IFNs induce a quick and potent signaling which leads to the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) many ISGs encode proteins that have been implicated in apoptosis [33, 34]. Unlike IFN-, IFN-s do not inhibit proliferation of several cell lines. FN- and IFN- differ in their antiproliferative effects. this was correlated with a difference in the duration of JAK/STAT signaling activity between the two IFNs and prolonged ISG expression upon IFN- treatment. a significant response to IFN- was reported in human hepatocytes [13, 32] suggesting the existence of some variations in the response to IFN- between mice and humans. in contrast to the hepatocytes, prominent response to IFN- was observed in intestinal epithelial cells. this response is higher and plays a critical role in protecting the intestinal epithelium from viral infection. thelial-like cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells were completely unresponsive to IFN-. the response of some subpopulations to IFN- is not excluded. the response of some subpopulations to IFN- is not excluded. the binding characteristics for each ligand are still under investigation. it will be important to analyze the IFN- activity in light of the IFN- binding to the cells and understand particularly the role of IFN-3, which possesses the highest activity as compared with the other IFN-s. IFN- played an important role in protecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts against virus infection. but in combination, type I and type III may provide a better viral protection. the first use of IFN- in the clinic has started for hepatitis C. the data showed an antiviral activity in all doses of pegylated IFN- tested. 29% of treatment-nave patients achieved rapid antiviral response. the treatment was well tolerated with few adverse effects. a constitutive production of IFN may play a role in HCV clearance and the success of IFN- treatment. these results suggest the therapeutic potential of the IFN- and IFN- combination therapy as demonstrated for the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model. to investigate the antitumor effect of IFN- in melanoma, we have used a gene therapy approach, consisting on the delivery of the IFN- gene to tumor cells. this approach does not require production and purification of the protein. the secretion of constant amounts of various cytokines by transduced tumor cells at the site of tumor growth could elicit more effective antitumor responses. we first evaluated the response of B16 melanoma cells to IFN-. by analyzing STAT1 activation and MHC class I antigen expression, we found that IFN- induces weak STAT1 phosphorylation but strong stimulation of MHC class I antigen expression. this result warrants further investigation in comparing the response to IFN- and IFN-. independent groups confirmed the role of IFN- as an antitumoral agent in melanoma and other tumor models. independent groups used the mouse melanoma B16F0 and B16F10 and the Colon26 cell lines transfected with IFN-2 cDNA. mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HCC is the most prevalent type of liver cancer. it is the fifth most common solid tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. it is also the second most lethal cancer with the five-year survival rate below 9%. the majority of clinical studies also concluded that IFN therapy, alone or in combination with ribavirin, decreased the incidence of HCC. however, numerous side effects limit the overall tolerability of IFN-, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. melanoma is a very aggressive cancer, and one of the therapeutic agents frequently used in the treatment of melanoma is IFN-. studies with low doses of IFN- have not shown significant increase in overall survival. the cytokine gene transfer into tumor cells could elicit more effective antitumor responses by acting directly on the tumor microenvironment. the potential of inducing the antitumor effect without eliciting the side effects associated with the systemic administration of high doses of cytokines. mIFN- (B16.IFN- cells) exhibited constitutively high levels of MHC class I antigen expression. all the syngeneic mice injected with parental B16 cells developed tumors. but the constitutive production of mIFN- by B16.IFN- cells markedly affected tumorigenicity. o et al. [68] used the mouse melanoma B16F0 and B16F10 and the Colon26 cell lines transfected with IFN-2 cDNA. they showed an increased activity of caspase 3/7, an induction of p21 and a dephosphoryation of Rb. this triggered a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is of limited benefit because of resistance of HCC to existing anticancer drugs. about 50% of patients with advanced disease die secondary to liver failure from cirrhosis. the antitumor properties of IFN- and IFN- limit the overall tolerability of IFN-, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. we expressed IFN- and IFN- genes under a strong constitutive promoter in BNL cells and selected stable cell lines, BNL-IFN- and BNL-IFN-, constitutively expressing IFN- and IFN- [45]. the antitumor activity of IFN- is associated with the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in bladder carcinoma and prostate cancer. the involvement of the immune system in the antitumor mechanism of IFN- was strongly suggested by Gresser et al. NK cells played a role in the antitumor mechanisms of IFN-. keratinocytes are highly sensitive to IFN- and they are known to interact with melanocytes. NK cells could also be recruited to the tumor microenvironment. NK cells, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells in antitumoral activity are induced by IFN- in the mouse model. the antitumor activity of IFN- was partially dependent on IFN-. IL-12-induced IFN- production in vivo, and expanded spleen cells in C57BL/6 mice. cytotoxicity against NK cells was dependent on IL-12 and IFN- and mediated by dendritic cells. a significant decrease in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs was observed in mice inoculated with BNL cells secreting IFN-. however, antitumor mechanisms activated by IFN- and IFN- may differ. the inhibition of Friend leukemia cells (FLC) by IFN- in mice was shown to depend on the activation of host cells, such as NK cells and macrophages. effective adaptive immunotherapy was observed in a T-cell lymphoma model, after the injection of tumor-sensitized spleen cells and IFN-. keratinocytes are highly sensitive to IFN- and they are known to interact with melanocytes, the cells from which the melanoma originates. we suggested that IFN- delivery to the tumor microenvironment may affect the function of the keratinocytes. NK cells could also be recruited to the tumor microenvironment and help destroy the tumor cells. Inoculation of MCA205-IFN- cells into mice enhanced IFN- production and cytotoxic T-cell activity in the spleen. IFN- increased total number of splenic NK cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, enhanced IL-12-induced IFN- production in vivo. a significant decrease in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs was observed in mice inoculated with BNL cells secreting IFN-. the moderate decrease in Tregs observed in mice receiving BNL cells secreting IFN- was not statistically significant. however, antitumor mechanisms activated by IFN- and IFN- may differ. the mice injected with IFN- and IFN- can completely reject the tumor. the mice that only received the BNL-IFN- cells showed a drastic tumor repression. we believe that IFN- is not simply acting like IFN-, with reduced side effects, but can be combined with IFN- to achieve efficient antitumor activity. the combination of IFNs with other cytokines, growth factors, or their antagonists could be an important strategy for the improvement of the IFN therapy. understanding the potential crosstalks between IFN-, IFN- and other cytokines or growth factors, such as TGF, could be rewarding and lead to new preclinical studies in animal models."}
