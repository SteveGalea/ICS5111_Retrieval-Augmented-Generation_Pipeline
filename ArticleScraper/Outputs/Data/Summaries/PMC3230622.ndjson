{"summary": "NSDV is a member of the genus Nairovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. it causes acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in sheep and goats. NSDV was originally thought to be endemic only in East Africa. genus contains more than 30 different virus isolates, loosely grouped based on serum cross-reactivity and hemagglutination inhibition. most important serogroups are the NSDV serogroup, which also includes dugbe virus (DUGV) and Kupe virus, and the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) serogroup, which contains CCHFV and Hazara virus, both human pathogens. IFNs are produced and released from the cell to induce an antiviral state in both itself and neighbouring cells. both type I and type II IFNs bind to their cognate cell-surface receptors, thereby activating a signal-transduction pathway. this pathway triggers the transcription of several hundreds of genes. CCHFV has developed a mechanism to remove the 5\u2032-terminal triphosphate group from its genome segments, thereby avoiding retinoic acid inducible gene I protein (RIG-I)-dependant IFN induction. another possible explanation may be the activity of the ovarian tumour-like domain found in the amino-terminus of the viral L protein. NSDV is able to reduce total protein ubiquitination and ISG15ylation in infected cells. this deconjugating activity is located in the N-terminal part of the NSDV L protein containing the OTU domain. inactivation of the enzymatic activity resulted in loss of its ability to antagonise IFN responses. to express luciferase could reflect viral effects at a number of different points in the induction, transcription and protein synthesis pathway. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been reported as being unable to block IFN induction in mammalian cells. neither NSDV/GV isolate, however, induced interferon until later stages in the infection cycle. significant difference between the two isolates, NSDV and GV, regarding the kinetics of activation of the IFN promoter. the ratio of these two activities was taken as the relative luciferase activity (in RLU) the error bars represent one standard error of the mean. NSDV/GV is able to block transcription from the IFN promoter at early stages of infection. NSDV and GV suppress transcription from the IFN promoter. vero cells were transfected with 500 ng each pIFN-luc and pJATLacZ. after 24 hours of transfection cells were infected with GV and NSDV at an MOI of 1 TCID50 unit per cell or left uninfected. luciferase activity was determined as described in material and methods. treatment of cells with IFN induced high levels of luciferase activity. same effect could be observed when cells were treated with IFN to induce the GAS element. NSDV/GV inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in type I and II IFN-stimulated Vero cells. binding of IFN/ to the type I IFN receptor results in the autophosphorylation and activation of JAK (Janus activated kinase) 1 and tyrosine kinase 2. in uninfected cells IFN treatment induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and 2. an almost complete block of STAT1 phosphorylation was observed in NSDV infected cells. neither virus was as effective at inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT2. the cells were harvested and the levels of STATs and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins were determined by Western blot analysis with the corresponding specific antibodies. the GV L protein inhibits transcription from the IFN promoter so far the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from CCHFV and DUGV are the only nairoviral proteins known to interfere with the host innate immune response. expression constructs encoding amino- and carboxy-terminal parts of GV L protein. cloned two shorter fragments of the amino- and carboxy-terminal part of the viral polymerase that contained the OTU domain (aa L1-1757 and aa L1749-3391 respectively) only the expression of the glycoprotein Gc which had the carboxy-terminal V5 tag could be analysed. al antibody to the V5 epitope or to the His epitope as required. lysed with NP40 lysis buffer as described in Methods. results were combined by setting the RLUs induced by NDV to 100%. infected vero cells were transfected with reporter plasmids carrying a luciferase gene under control of type I and II IFN-responsive promoters (pGL3-Mx-1-luc and GAS-luc) the cells were treated with IFN or IFN to induce transcription from the IFN-responsive promoters. the reporter gene activity in cells treated with IFN or IFN was significantly reduced in presence of the GV L protein constructs. infection with NSDV/GV reduces total protein ubiquitination and ISG15ylation in 293T cells. cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin. infection with either isolate caused a decrease in total protein ubiquitination. ISG15 conjugation to host cell proteins exerts antiviral activity against influenza virus [42] and Sindbis virus [43]. plasmids encode the core components of the ISG15 conjugation system, the E1 activating protein (mUBE1L), E2 conjugating protein (UbcM8) and E3 ligase (mHerc6) into cells in the absence of IFN. a further 12 h cells were lysed in SDS PAGE sample buffer. total protein ubiquitination was determined by Western blot using anti-HA. extra negative control cells were transfected with 250 ng of plasmid expressing CCHFV L1-354-HA (Lane 4) or GV L1-169-V5 (Lane 5) or left untransfected (Lane 1). PCNA levels served as loading control in all experiments. GV was responsible for the reduction in ISG15ylation in 293FT cells. expression of the GV or CCHFV OTU domain effectively blocked conjugation of ISG15 to cellular proteins. the CCHFV OTU also blocked ISG15ylation in 293FT cells. the Q16R mutant performed like the wildtype regarding its ability to remove ISG15 from cellular substrates. its deubiquitinating activity was only slightly reduced when compared to the wildtype OTU (fig. 8a) cells were transfected with 250 ng pHis-mISG15 and 1250 ng empty plasmid (Lane 2). after 30 h of transfection cells were lysed and total ISG15ylation was analyzed by Western blot using anti-6His. -galactosidase activities determined as described in material and methods. results from three separate experiments were combined by setting the RLUs induced by SV or IFN in cells transfected with empty vector to 100%. all three mutants lost their ability to block SV-induced IFN activity when compared to the wildtype. virus L protein plays a pivotal role in antagonizing IFN induction and action. this protein is still able to remove ubiquitin and ISG15 from the dominant cellular substrates, but lost its ability to block type I IFN action. NSDV/GV isolate proved to be still pathogenic in sheep. failure to express luciferase could reflect viral effects at a number of different points in the induction, transcription and protein synthesis pathway. failure to express luciferase could reflect viral effects at a number of different points in the induction, transcription and protein synthesis pathway. neither NSDV/GV isolate, however, induced interferon until later stages in the infection cycle. significant difference between the two isolates, NSDV and GV, regarding the kinetics of activation of the IFN promoter. the ratio of these two activities was taken as the relative luciferase activity (in RLU) the error bars represent one standard error of the mean. NSDV/GV is able to block transcription from the IFN promoter at early stages of infection. NSDV/GV is rather avoiding the activation of the IFN promoter. NSDV and GV suppress transcription from the IFN promoter. vero cells were transfected with 500 ng each pIFN-luc and pJATLacZ. after 24 hours of transfection cells were infected with GV and NSDV at an MOI of 1 TCID50 unit per cell or left uninfected. treatment of cells with IFN induced high levels of luciferase activity. GV and NSDV were similarly effective in reducing promoter activity in the presence of IFN to less than forty percent of the activity in uninfected cells. results from two (for IFN) or three (for IFN) experiments were combined by setting the RLUs induced by IFN or IFN in uninfected cells to 100%. errors show standard errors of the normalised data. NSDV/GV inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in type I and II IFN-stimulated Vero cells. in uninfected cells IFN treatment induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and 2. an almost complete block of STAT1 phosphorylation was observed in NSDV infected cells. the GV isolate also inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation. the cells were harvested and the levels of STATs and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins were determined by Western blot analysis with the corresponding specific antibodies. the GV L protein inhibits transcription from the IFN promoter so far the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from CCHFV and DUGV are the only nairoviral proteins known to interfere with the host innate immune response [24] expression constructs encoding amino- and carboxy-terminal parts of GV L protein. cloned two shorter fragments of the amino- and carboxy-terminal part of the viral polymerase that contained the OTU domain (aa L1-1757 and aa L1749-3391 respectively) only the expression of the glycoprotein Gc which had the carboxy-terminal V5 tag could be analysed. nal antibody to the V5 epitope or to the His epitope as required. lysed with NP40 lysis buffer as described in Methods. results were combined by setting the RLUs induced by NDV to 100%. GV L protein inhibits transcription from IFN-responsive promoters. the two shortest versions of the GV protein were the most efficient in blocking the action of IFN and IFN. infection with NSDV/GV reduces total protein ubiquitination and ISG15ylation in 293T cells. cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin. infection with either isolate caused decrease in total protein ubiquitination compared to uninfected cells. ISG15 conjugation to host cell proteins exerts antiviral activity against influenza virus [42] and Sindbis virus [43]. plasmids encode the core components of the ISG15 conjugation system, the E1 activating protein (mUBE1L), E2 conjugating protein (UbcM8) and E3 ligase (mHerc6) into cells in the absence of IFN. infection of NSDV/GV resulted in a drastic decrease in ISG a further 12 h cells were lysed in SDS PAGE sample buffer. total protein ubiquitination was determined by Western blot using anti-HA. cM8 alone (Lane 2) or together with 250 ng of plasmid expressing CCHFV L1-354-HA (Lane 4) or GV L1-169-V5 (Lane 5) or left untransfected (Lane 1). cells were transfected with 250 ng pHis-mISG15 and 750 ng empty plasmid (Lane 1). expression of the GV or CCHFV OTU domain effectively blocked conjugation of ISG15 to cellular proteins. the CCHFV OTU also blocked ISG15ylation in 293FT cells. the Q16R mutant performed like the wildtype regarding its ability to remove ISG15 from cellular substrates. its deubiquitinating activity was only slightly reduced when compared to the wildtype OTU (fig. 8a) cells were transfected with 250 ng pHis-mISG15 and 1250 ng empty plasmid (Lane 2). after 30 h of transfection cells were lysed and total ISG15ylation was analyzed by Western blot using anti-6His. -galactosidase activities determined as described in material and methods. results from three separate experiments were combined by setting the RLUs induced by SV or IFN in cells transfected with empty vector to 100%. all three mutants lost their ability to block SV-induced IFN activity when compared to the wildtype. ovirus L protein plays a pivotal role in antagonizing IFN induction and action. the protein is still able to remove ubiquitin and ISG15 from the dominant cellular substrates, but lost its ability to block type I IFN action. NSDV is considered one of the most pathogenic diseases in sheep and goats with mortality rates ranging from 40% in Merino sheep to 90% in Masai sheep. expression of the N-terminal part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) was sufficient to reproduce the antagonistic effect on IFN induction in a reporter gene-based assay. we could show that mutations that affected the catalytic site of the OTU protease were no longer antagonists. ubiquitination and modification of cellular proteins with ubiquitin-like molecules such as ISG15 play important roles in regulating IFN induction through both the several other viruses have exploited this mechanism of negatively regulating the IFN induction by encoding proteases of the OTU family [24], [30], [53], [54]. all these proteases exert deconjugating activities towards ubiquitin or the ubiquitin-like (ubl) molecule ISG15 or both. the GV isolate retained most of its DUB activity and its full deISG15ylating activity. the GV mutant exerts a steric inhibition on binding to the target involved in blocking type II IFN action. the virus had a stronger effect on IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation than on STAT2 phosphorylation. differences were seen in the effectiveness of the different fragments of the GV L to block IFN- or IFN-induced gene transcription. GV L1-169 and L1-667 reduced the transcriptional activity induced by IFN to 30% and 40% respectively of the positive control. the protein L1-1757 was less effective in reducing the transcriptional activity of the promoter or the GAS promoter. there was a clear difference between the activity of the CCHFV and NSDV/GV in the murine ISG15ylation system used in this study. it is possible that the OTUs of different viruses may be adapted to species differences in these modifying proteins. it will be important to examine the actual level of modification of host cell proteins when these viruses are grown in cells from different hosts. 293FT (a fast-growing variant of the HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell line that expresses the SV40 large T antigen) were maintained in DMEM with 25 mM HEPES buffer supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin sulphate (100 g/ml) the virus titre was determined as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in BHK21 cells. both strains grew to similar final titres (106/ml) total RNA from GV-infected BHK21 cells was extracted by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen) the viral genome was amplified by PCR using NSDV/GV genome-specific oligos and subsequently blunt-end cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen) mouse monoclonal antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. rabbit anti-N antiserum recognizing amino terminus of the NSDV and GV N protein were previously made in our laboratory. luminescence and absorbance measurements were done in a Synergy 2, Multi Detection Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments) using Gen5 software. the values were normalised and statistically analysed as previously described. 293FT (a fast-growing variant of the HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell line that expresses the SV40 large T antigen) were maintained in DMEM with 25 mM HEPES buffer supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin sulphate (100 g/ml) the Nairobi sheep disease virus isolate (NSDV) isolate (IG619, TVPII 236) GMEM containing 2% FCS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulphate (100 g/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% tryptose phosphate broth solution. both strains grew to similar final titres (106/ml) pcDNA-GV-N and pcDNA-GV-M were cloned into pcDNA6/V5-His.
