{"summary": "hantavirus epidemics have emerged in ecosystems that exhibit habitat degradation and climatic disturbances. global warming, human population growth, globalisation, wildlife trade and pollution of oceans and freshwater bodies may have an impact on the prevalence and distribution of infectious pathogens. conservation medicine studies the two-way interactions between pathogens and disease on the one hand and species and ecosystems on the other. it focuses on the study of the ecological context of health and the remediation of ecological health problems. conservation medicine is concerned with the effects of disease on rare or endangered species and on the functioning of ecosystems. the spread of Lyme disease in a landscape devoid of large predators and diminished biodiversity is a good example of ecological magnification of disease. bioinformatics and the creation, management and dissemination of databases relevant to wildlife, their habitats and their diseases may be crucial to this new discipline. global climate change and disease emergence Climate change is one of the most pressing ecological health concerns today. up to 37% of over 1,000 animal and plant species in six regions of the planet are at risk of extinction from climate change. a higher prevalence of trichinellosis has been observed with a huge zoonotic potential to indigenous peoples feeding on these pinnipeds. climate change is expected to continue to alter the distribution of disease vectors. climate is closely associated with the natural history of vectors so warmer temperatures will increase their range and distribution. 119 parasites and infectious diseases were interchangeable between wild and domestic mammals in Florida. more than 46% of wild and domestic swine were helminths when wild and domestic swine were included. domestic dogs pose a significant risk as reservoirs for infectious diseases, especially for wild canids. population density represents a disease risk in these situations where feral dogs have established large packs. rabies claimed more than half of the Ethiopian wolves in the bale mountain national park. rabies also killed African wild dogs in the Masai Mara reserve in 1989 and in the Serengeti in 1990. an assessment of pathogens might pose a problem and their patterns of infection in natural hosts is necessary. up to 37% of over 1,000 animal and plant species in six regions of the planet are at risk of extinction from climate change. some scenarios produce projections of species committed to extinction of 18% (minimal climate-warming), 24% (mid-range warming) and 35% (maximum-warming) the geographic range of ticks and mosquitoes that carry disease has changed in response to climate change. climate is closely associated with the natural history of vectors so warmer temperatures will increase their range and distribution. 119 parasites and infectious diseases were interchangeable between wild and domestic mammals in Florida. more than 46% were helminths when wild and domestic swine were included. 10% were considered zoonotic. domestic dogs pose a significant risk as reservoirs for infectious diseases. population density represents a disease risk in these situations where feral dogs have established large packs. hyaenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also affected. rabies claimed more than half of the Ethiopian wolves in the bale mountain national park. rabies also killed African wild dogs in the Masai Mara reserve in 1989. the wolf population in the region declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Anaplasmosis Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila, Ehrlichia equi and Anaplasma phagocytophila) is the causative agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis (anaplasmosis) in humans, horses, sheep, cattle, dogs and cats. over 450 european sheep ticks collected from 100 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Hungary were different Borrelia species and serotypes were tested for their sensitivity to serum complement from various animals and humans. wolves were identified as a probable reservoir in nature. elucidate the mode of transmission especially to identify potential vectors and to determine how humans become infected. 40 domestic dogs in two villages and at two smaller settlements bordering the national park were sampled for exposure to canine diseases. high levels of exposure were found to CDV and CPV, both of which are known to cause mortality in maned wolves and other carnivores. rabies virus, leptospira interrogans spp., T. gondii and D. immitis may be at increased disease risk due to these pathogens originating in the domestic dog population. a seroepidemiological survey was conducted to assess the prevalence of antibodies reactive with the Ehrlichia canis and E. phagocytophila (newly named Anaplasma phagocytophilum) genogroup antigens. canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) has been recently documented in wild canids in endemic regions of Europe. pathologic and parasitologic analysis of a grey wolf (Canis lupus) found dead and confirmed by PCR. three of 33 wolves (9%) presented low levels of antibodies to L. infantum infection using an ELISA test. parasitology and serology tests were performed in domestic (n = 1568) and wild jackals (Canis aureus, n = 10), red foxes (n = 10) and wolves (n = 10) in Iran. ten out of 11 leishmania spp. isolated from dogs and wild canines were identified as L. infantum and one other as L. tropica. over 450 european sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus) collected from 100 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Hungary were tested for the pathogen as 112 pools each containing five or fewer ticks from one fox. six foxes were infected in the PCR-based test. 100 skin samples of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were tested positive for B. burgdorferi in Brandenburg, Germany. a new species denominated Candidatus B. texasensis was isolated in 1998 from an adult male Dermacentor variabilis tick feeding on a coyote. 40 domestic dogs in two villages and at two smaller settlements bordering the national park were sampled for exposure to canine diseases. high levels of exposure were found to CDV and CPV, both of which are known to cause mortality in maned wolves and other carnivores. the study reports evidence of exposure to several diseases in the domestic dogs bordering the park. a ological survey was conducted to assess the prevalence of antibodies reactive with the Ehrlichia canis and E. phagocytophila (newly named Anaplasma phagocytophilum) genogroup antigens and the spotted-fever group rickettsiae antigens in jackals (Canis aureus syriacus) in Israel. a total of 53 serum samples were tested and antibodies were detected in 36% to E. can three of 33 wolves (9%) presented low levels of antibodies to L. infantum infection using an ELISA test. an epizootiological survey of leishmaniosis in 67 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was conducted in southwestern Europe. the first PCR detection of Hepatozoon canis in a naturally infected red fox from Slovakia was recently performed. it is believed that the infection was spread by infected R. sanguineus that might have been brought to Slovakia by travellers, golden jackals, or foxes migrating because of expansion of golden jackals. d species are the proverbial \"canaries in the mine shaft\" they serve as indicators of their environment and may reflect the quality of health in their ecosystems. the scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities. domestic animal importance including rabies, parvovirus infection, canine distemper and mange. wild caninds adapted to the human condition host innumerable parasites, bacteria and viruses. further research is necessary to identify wild reservoirs, susceptible hosts and zoonotic interactions."}
