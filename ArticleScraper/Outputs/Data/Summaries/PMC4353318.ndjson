{"summary": "MERS-CoV was circulating in Zarqa, Jordan as early as April 2012, causing at least 2 deaths and likely 7 close contact infections. between April 2012 and may 2014, there have been 536 reports of laboratory-confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV. the ppNT assay included infecting monolayers of vero E6 cells. the pseudoparticles were pre-incubated with serially diluted sera for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. after 2 days of incubation, 100 l of luciferase substrate was added. our and Peiris' laboratory found the neutralizing titer of the polyclonal rabbit sera to be comparable to that measured by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories live virus neutralization assay (1:2560). aliquots of sera were shipped to the University of Florida for serological assessment. the ppNT assay included infecting monolayers of vero E6 cells. the pseudoparticles were pre-incubated with serially diluted sera for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. after 2 days of incubation, 100 l of luciferase substrate, ONE-Glo luciferase assay system was added. a small percentage (16.9%) of participants reported themselves to be semi-nomadic, with possible movement outside of the Jazan region. 25% reported some form of contact with domestic animals including camels, cattle, horse, goats, or sheep. 17% reported daily contact with domestic camels during the 12 months to enrollment. negative results suggest population naivety to MERS-CoV infection in this region of KSA 1 month after the first earliest case was reported in another region of the country. studies postulated that camels are likely a reservoir for the virus in the Middle East. sensitivity, or MERS-CoV infection may produce a weak or transient immune response following mild or asymptomatic infection. only a subset of the human population has the predilection to be infected by MERS-CoV, either because of genetic polymorphisms or unusual routes of exposure. participants, jazan region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, July 2012. irv0009-0064-sd1.docx (12.6KB, docx) Table S1.
