{"summary": "insulin-producing islets of Langerhans, scattered throughout the pancreas, are selectively destroyed by an apparent autoimmune process. the transplantation of the entire human pancreas from a deceased organ donor provides another therapeutic option for diabetic patients. a necessary component of the transplantation of an allogeneic pancreas is the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. the double layered agarose encapsulation of the porcine islets also provides at least some protection from recipient immune responses to the xenogeneic islets. we have previously shown the porcine islet macrobeads to enable the discontinuation of exogenous insulin for more than 6 months. ischemia times averaged 12.26 minutes while cold ischemia times ranged from 30 minutes to one hour. a 12-hour light cycle was maintained throughout the study with lights on at 0700 hours. 500 islet equivalents were encapsulated in each agarose-agarose macrobead. a maximum of 400 macrobeads per tube were stored overnight at room temperature (18\u201328\u00b0C) in RPMI (Gibco Life Technologies, 22400) containing 1% A/A. a USP 62 microbial limits test was performed by incubation of samples in lactose broth for 48 hours at 30\u201335\u00b0C. contents were streaked to brilliant green agar (BGA), xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar, and bismuth sulfite (BS) agar plates for 48 hours at 32.5\u00b0C 2.5\u00b0C.

HSX-1 received the glucose/arginine challenge. histopathology At the time of pancreatectomy, both pancreas and omentum were fixed in 10% NBF for 24 hrs, washed, and stored in 70% ethanol. tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5 m sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. powder was added to food at a dose of 1 tsp/meal following pancreatectomy. room temperature was maintained at 18\u201328\u00b0C with relative humidity of 30\u201370%. 12-hour light cycle was maintained throughout the study with lights on at 0700 hours. the tubes were centrifuged at 2000 RPM, and islet-containing layers were manually collected. 500 islet equivalents were encapsulated in each agarose-agarose macrobead. a maximum of 400 macrobeads per tube were stored overnight. a USP 62 microbial limits test for Salmonella sp. was performed by incubation of samples in lactose broth for 48 hours at 30\u201335\u00b0C. contents were streaked to brilliant green agar (BGA), xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar and bismuth sulfite (BS) agar plates for 48 hours at 32.5\u00b0C 2.5\u00b0C.

PERV specific sequences were detected in all islet macrobead samples. in samples from both control and implanted dogs, low level amplification signals for PCV were found in different tissues suggestive of cross-reaction with canine sequences. the dogs were considered to have exogenous insulin requirements established by week 4after induction. blood glucose levels of study animals are shown as an average of daily AM and PM blood glucose levels (open circles) porcine C-peptide was not detected in the serum of any study animals before pancreatectomy or prior to macrobead implantation. HSX-1 showed only minimal levels of C-peptide following both implant procedures with levels ranging from 0.1\u20130.2 ng/mL. control animals did not undergo the peritoneal challenge or fluid collection procedure. porcine C-peptide was detected in the peritoneal fluid of HSX-1 and KOX-1 but not in the peritoneal fluid from FOX-1. over the next several months, study animals regained body weight. macroscopic views of mesentery from implanted and control dogs were nearly identical (Figure 3) demonstrating the biocompatibility of the agarose macrobeads. lobes of the liver from all 3 implanted dogs presented with occasional indentations due to the presence of macrobeads. the majority of the macrobeads were found to contain amorphous basophilic, mineralized granules. the majority of the macrobeads were found to contain amorphous basophilic, mineralized granules. more than 80 years of using porcine insulin in the clinic has also not revealed any transmission of PERV. preclinical studies in nonhuman primates have also not detected any evidence of PERV transmission. the ability of the islet macrobeads to survive extended culture periods up to at least one year [6] provides ample opportunity to determine the insulin production from each batch. the agarose-agarose islet macrobead affords ample time for extensive microbiological safety testing. we consider this an advanced technique to the antemortem screening of donor animals because the tissue to be transplanted can be tested directly. this is a significant technological advance and one with the potential to finally make xenotransplantation a reality. the islet macrobeads were found to be biocompatible at necropsy. only one animal had any evidence of a broken macrobead. the results demonstrate the ability of the islet macrobeads to resist breakage in vivo. patents covering the technology are owned by The Rogosin Institute. the ongoing maintenance fees for these patents are paid for by The Rogosin Institute."}
