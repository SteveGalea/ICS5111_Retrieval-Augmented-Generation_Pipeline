{"summary": "more than 1600 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been documented in 26 countries until the end of 2015. the syndrome generally presents as lower respiratory tract disease that includes fever, cough, and shortness of breath that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. a female diagnosed with diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room with a history of high-grade fever of one-day duration. she denied any history of cough or shortness of breath but complained of generalized bone pain and fatigue. patient 2 gave history of contact with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV. he was admitted to an isolated room as a case of acute viral illness with bronchitis. he received intravenous immunoglobulins 400 mg/kg daily for five days. the name corona denotes the crown-like appearance of the surface projections of the virus under the electron microscope. they may cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurological diseases in various species including humans. there are six types of coronaviruses that afflict humans and thus are called human coronaviruses. APN Nonciliated airway epithelial cells, human monocytes, and neuronal cells Droplets Coryza, cough, sore throat, and rhinitis Upper and lower respiratory infection, associated with croup in children Mild and harmless NL63 2004 Bats Unknown Ciliated airway epithelial cells Droplets Rhinorrhea, fever, coughing, wheezing, and myalgia Upper respiratory infection and pneumonia. dromedary camels are part of the culture and economic resources for many businessmen and low-income citizens in Saudi Arabia. the disease in camels can be just as the common cold. but in humans, the virus may progress to ARDS, multiorgan failure, and death in severe cases. viral spread occurs when a given virus infects neuronal tissue in the periphery with subsequent spread to the CNS. some coronaviruses possess neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties in various hosts including humans, pigs, and rodents. this could be due to the resistance of coronaviruses to culture by in vitro culture systems. this theory is predominant in explaining the neurological complications of other viruses such as the pandemic influenza A H1N1 pdm09 [17]. this has therapeutic implications including the possible improvement with the early use of pulse steroid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin before tissue damage occurs. steroids and immunoglobulins have been reported previously in the literature in the treatment of SARS-CoV infected patients along with ribavirin. patients age/sex Presenting symptoms Comorbidities Diagnosis Treatments Outcome Cause of death Patient 1 [4] 74/M Ataxia, vomiting, confusion, and fever Diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) cough None Critical illness polyneuropathy Azithromycin, oseltamivir, antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulins, and physiotherapy Recovery Not applicable 6. Conclusion MERS-CoV has created an alarming anxiety in the health sector due to the number of confirmed cases and deaths."}
