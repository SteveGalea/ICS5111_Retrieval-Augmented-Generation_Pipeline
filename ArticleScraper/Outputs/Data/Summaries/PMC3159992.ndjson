{"summary": "depression presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia. depression can lead to suicide, a tragic fatality associated with the loss of about 850 000 thousand lives every year. by 2020, depression is projected to reach 2nd place of the ranking of DALYs. the most widely prescribed antidepressants come from a class of medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) the older tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) the common side effects include sexual problems, drowsiness, fatigue, sleep difficulties, nausea weight gain, nervousness, dry mouth, and blurred vision. the paper aims to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of xiaoyaosan (wan) for treatment of depression in randomized trials. methods 2.1. Database and Search Strategies Literature searches were conducted in national knowledge infrastructure (1999\u20132009), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (1989\u20132009), PubMed (1950\u20132009), and Cochrane library (Issue 3, 2009) the methodological quality of trials was assessed using the 6 criteria 6 election bias (study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, withdrawals and dropouts) to following 3 categories: Category A (strong quality): less than four strong ratings and one weak rating. Category C (moderate quality): less than four strong ratings and one weak rating. randomized controlled trials combined xiaoyansan with antidepressants compared with antidepressants. results include clinical comprehensive effect, self-rating depression scale (HAMD) scores, self-rating anxiety scale (HAMA) scores, clinical global impression (CGI) scores, the scale for TCM syndrome and symptom differentiation (TCM-SSD) scores. dichotomous data were presented as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence interval (CI) the statistical heterogeneity was presented as significant when I square (I 2) is over 50% or P 0.1. fixed effect model was used when the heterogeneity was not significant (I 2 > 50%) u formula amitriptyline 6 clinical effect, side effect Huo et al.

Publication Bias A funnel plot analysis of the 14 trials comparing xiaoyaosan plus antidepressants to antidepressants on Clinical Comprehensive Effect was generated. it showed a significant asymmetry (Figure 2). three trials reported no side effect in xiaoyaosan group including headache, dizziness, and slightly diarrhea. xiaoyaosan may have same effectiveness as antidepressants at end point of treatment with less side effects. the combination of xiaoyaosan and antidepressants group may have significant beneficial effect compared to the antidepressants group variable on onset time with less side adverse events. the onset time are variable may depend on the form of prescription such as pills and decoctions. the number of trials identified limits us to perform meaningful subgroup or sensitivity analyses to illuminate robustness of the results in the review. sixteen out of twenty-seven trials did not described the blinding in details, only two used double-dummy in their study design. the classification of cure, significant effective, effective, or ineffective are not internationally recognized, and these outcome measurement are vague to interpret the effect. most of the sample size in the including 26 trials is small and there is a moderate risk of bias. the mechanism [12] may due to the regulating the levels of 5-HT, CORT, BDNF, IL-6. a longer follow-up period with serial measurement of outcomes after the treatment is important to determine the effectiveness and long term effect of the xiaoyaosan prescription."}
