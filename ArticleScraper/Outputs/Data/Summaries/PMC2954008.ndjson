Strongly Disagree Strongly Agree 1 2 3 4 5. the prevalence of T. whipplei in feces of healthy children 2\u201310 years of age who lived in rural Senegal (sub-Saharan Africa) was 44% (46/105) (21). we hypothesize that T. whipplei may cause gastroenteritis in children as a result of its primary contact with humans. children with gastroenteritis and positive PCR results for T. whipplei were tested retrospectively for T. whipplei by Western blot analysis. controls All T. whipplei\u2013infected case-patients were compared with 67 cases-patients of the same age. forty-seven stool specimens from children 2\u20134 years of age without gastroenteritis were also tested for T. whipplei by using PCR. temperature of incubation was 37\u00b0C, with the exception of Yersinia agar. stool specimens were tested by using a chromatographic immunoassay with a VIKIA Rota-Adeno Kit (bioM\u00e9rieux) kit and electron microscopy with negative staining. amplification conditions involved an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 min. followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s. annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 60 s, with fluorescence acquisition in single mode. T. whipplei Twist proteins were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mmol/L dithiothreitol. the protein lysate was heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. five micrograms of native protein was loaded into wells of 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. the first screening was performed by testing for all immunoglobulins (Igs) positive cases were then tested to separately detect IgG and IgM. a case-patient was defined as a child 2\u20134 years of age. 67 children had negative results for T. whipplei in stool specimens. forty-seven stool specimens from children 2\u20134 years of age without gastroenteritis were also tested for T. whipplei. stool specimens were tested by using a chromatographic immunoassay with a VIKIA Rota-Adeno Kit (bioM\u00e9rieux) kit and electron microscopy with negative staining. adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, norwalk virus, coronavirus, and enterovirus were detected. a second PCR used a Taqman probe (13 forward\u2013163 reverse, 5\u2032-6-FAM-AGAAGAGAGAAGATGTTACGGGTTG-TAMRA-3\u2032) specific for a different 150-bp sequence, as described elsewhere. the number of transcript copies in each sample was then calculated from the standard curve by using lightCycler software. T. whipplei Twist proteins were resuspended in laemmli buffer. protein lysate was heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. five micrograms of native protein was loaded into wells of a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sufate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a total of 241 children 2\u20134 years of age with gastroenteritis were tested. samples from 36 (15%) were positive for T. whipplei. in 2006, 2007, and 2008, the infection rates for T. whipplei were comparable. a dendogram showed phylogenetic organization of genotypes. we observed genetic heterogeneity in sequences associated with gastroenteritis. case-patients with Whipple disease were significantly more likely to be seropositive than controls with diarrhea. patients without T. whipplei detected from stool samples but with positive Western blot serologic results. compared with those of 67 control children of the same age who had gastroenteritis but were negative for T. whipplei. weight loss, kg 0.9 0.6 0.55 0.35 0.045 Vomiting 20 (55.5) 45 (67) 0.2 Abdominal pain 9 (25) 14 (21) 0.3 Dehydration 11 (30.5) 25 (37) 0.5 Watery diarrhea 25 (69) 46 (69) 0.9 Bloody diarrhea 3 (8) 5 (7.5) 0.9 Duration of fever, d 1.4 1 3.6 3.7 0.003 Duration of hospitalization, d 1.4 1 3.6 3.7 0.003 Duration of hospital 205 cases-patients with gastroenteritis who were negative for T. whipplei were co-infected with an associated pathogen. co-infection was less common in 23 children with high T. whipplei bacterial loads (>104/g of stool) than in 13 children with lower bacterial loads (5/23 vs. 8/13;p = 0.02) T. whipplei is excreted in a live form by patients with Whipple disease (9), and T. whipplei DNA is found in stool samples of healthy persons (22) this bacterium is commonly found in sewers (20,23) and has also been detected in sewage (25). serologic analysis by Western blotting for T. whipplei (29) showed that all children who were PCR positive for T. whipplei had IgM against T. whipplei. the prevalence of antibodies in case-patients was higher than that in controls. this may explain why this bacterium causes diarrhea in children. we identified 1 clone (genotype 3) in 10 children. this indicates that this clone is circulating in our population. however, for unknown reasons, T. whipplei could replicate in children with low-grade chronic infections without causing diarrhea."}
