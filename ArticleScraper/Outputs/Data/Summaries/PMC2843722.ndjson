{"summary": "there have been more than 445 confirmed human cases of H5N1. there have been 263 deaths (59% mortality rate) in almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had physical contact with infected birds. the threat posed by emerging strains of influenza is unpredictable. the mouse model is not ideal for the evaluation of H5N1 infection and vaccines due to differences in HA receptor specificity and distribution, influenza pathogenicity, as well as clinical symptomatology. in mice, DNA/rAd5 vaccination with NP and M2 from the H1N1 PR/8 strain induced both humoral and cellular immune responses. triple prime with rAd boost regimens of NP in combination with HA have been shown to protect ferrets against the lethal H5N1 virus. in this study, we evaluated protective immunity induced by NP and M2 in a triple DNA prime, rAd boost regimen against lethal H5N1 challenge. gene expression in 293T and A549 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. adenoviruses encoding HA (KAN-1), NP (KAN-1) and M2 (KAN-1) were transfected into 293T cells for 48 hours. the virus stock was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated hens' eggs. the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) titers were determined by serial titration of viruses in eggs and calculated by the Reed and Muench method. each group received 15 g plasmid DNA in 100 l of PBS (pH 7.4) intramuscularly at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. for the single HA or NP plasmid group, each group received 5 g DNA for each plasmid with 10 g of control vector as filler DNA (total 15 g) for the 2 plasmid combination group (HA+NP+M2), 5 g of each plasmid DNA was used as total DNA ferrets were immunized three times with a total of 250 g plasmid DNA in 500 l of PBS (pH 7.4) intramuscularly in the quadriceps muscle at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. each animal received 83 g DNA for each plasmid with 167 g of control vector as filler DNA (total 250 g) s were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (24 mg/kg), xylazine (2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg) cocktail. they were inoculated intranasally with 107 EID50 of virus in 1 ml of PBS. body temperature and weight were measured using an implantable subcutaneous temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE) supernatant of NP (KAN-1) encoded plasmid transfected 293 cells. dilution of NP (KAN-1) in 13 dilution with PBS. end-point titers were determined by linear regression analysis. hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay of ferret sera was performed using four hemagglutinin units of virus and 1% horse RBC as previously described [37]\u2013[40]. re-assortant strains were obtained and expanded at BIOQUAL in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described. this assay has been developed as a safer, highly sensitive alternative to HAI and MN assays that can be applied in a high-throughput format. rAd serotype 5 vectors expressing HA (KAN-1), NP (KAN-1) and M2 (KAN-1) genes were synthesized using human-preferred codons. gene expression was confirmed using 293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) transfected cells by Western blot analysis. plasmids and adenoviruses encoding various influenza viral genes were tested for their expression in 293T and A549 cells. plasmids and adenoviruses were tested for their expression in 293T and A549 cells. the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) titers were determined by serial titration of viruses in eggs and calculated by the Reed and Muench method. all research with HPAI virus was conducted under Biosafety Level 3 containment. female BALB/c mice, 6\u20138 weeks old, were immunized as previously described. all challenged animals were exposed to an intranasal viral inoculum of 100 LD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus. body weight and survival were monitored for 21 days. DNA and rAd5 vaccination and viral challenge of ferrets. the ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with 1010 particles of recombinant adenoviruses expressing HA, NP, M2 or in different combinations similar to their DNA immunization combinations. at week 9, the ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with 1010 particles of recombinant adenoviruses expressing HA, NP, M2 or in different combinations similar to their DNA immunization combinations the nasal washes were frozen on dry ice and stored at 70\u00b0C until they were processed. any ferret that lost more than 25% of its body weight or exhibited neurological dysfunction was euthanized and submitted to postmortem examination. end-point titers were determined by linear regression analysis of the absorbance values (OD 450) as previously described [32]\u2013[34], with R2>0.9 obtained from a series of three-fold dilutions, as the cut-off value was set as 0.3. for mice, two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were tested for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of H ferret sera was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme by diluting one part serum with three parts enzyme. enzyme was inactivated by 30 min. incubation at 56\u00b0C followed by addition of six parts PBS for a final dilution of 1/10. recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described. luciferase activity was measured after 48 hours using mammalian cell lysis buffer and luciferase assay reagent. survival differences between animal groups were tested by log-rank test using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) expression of rAd5 vectors confirmed in 293T cells transfected by eukaryotic plasmid expression vectors. western blot analysis confirmed expression of rAd5 vectors. rAd5 vectors were encoding HA (KAN-1) (lane 8), NP (KAN-1) and M2 (KAN-1) (lane 11) study cohorts consisted of 10 female mice for the HA alone, HA+NP, and HA+NP+M2 groups, and 5 animals for the NP alone and vector control groups. all HA-containing groups showed an increase in HA ELISA titer compared to the control cohort (p0.0013) a single asterisk (*) represents a p-value between 0.008 and 0.001. a single asterisk (*) represents a p-value between 0.008 and 0.001. a single asterisk (*) represents a p-value between 0.008 and 0.001. HA group with lower titers in animals immunized with HA+NP and lowest responses in those vaccinated with HA+NP+M2 (Table 1). but minimal neutralization was evident in NP-only immunized animals.

NP DNA immunization with HA, HA+NP, and HA+NP+M2 induces similar protection after A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus challenge in mice. survival data is shown as a percentage comparing the final animal number at day 21 with the initial animal number in each group. ELISA titers to HA, NP and M2 were determined after DNA immunization. HA alone group elicited significant anti-HA immunity that increased after rAd5 HA boost (Figure 4A, middle panel) compared to controls. each bar represents the group mean for the end-point titers of total IgG and IgM, determined in duplicate by series dilution of ELISA assay. only p-values less than 0.05 are indicated for only the responses against HA at the first time point, and for all three antigens after the rAd5 boost. significant anti-NP humoral responses were detected in animals immunized with NP+M2 post-rAd boost (p0.0001). only HA-containing groups showed substantial neutralizing antibody titer responses. NP, M2 and NP+M2 groups showed no neutralization in each assay. titers from the nasal washes confirmed the antiviral effects of HA- but not NP-containing vaccines. both HA and HA+NP+M2 groups showed moderate viral titers at day 3 and day 7. survival, body weight, and viral titers are indistinguishable between the HA and HA+NP+M2 groups after viral challenge. ferrets immunized with HA and HA+NP+M2 groups showed no weight loss. control group ferrets showed rapid weight loss. survival percentage for each group was analyzed statistically by a log-rank test. expression of rAd5 vectors confirmed in 293T cells transfected by eukaryotic plasmid expression vectors. vectors encoding HA (KAN-1) (lane 8), NP (KAN-1) (lane 9), and M2 (KAN-1) (lane 11) sera from individual mice immunized with HA, HA+NP, HA+NP+M2, NP and vector control were collected 10 days after the third DNA immunization. each bar represents the group mean (n = 5 for NP, control; n = 10 for HA, HA+NP, HA+NP+M2) for the end-point titers of the total IgG and IgM against HA(KAN-1) purified protein (HA), groups were at the border of statistical significance by ANOVA. the only M2-containing group, HA+NP+M2, elicited a significant humoral response against M2 protein compared to control (p0.0001) in analyzing antibody responses against NP protein.

HA group showed the least amount of body weight loss, with the other HA-containing groups showing similar patterns. however, the NP-immunized group demonstrated severe weight loss, similar to controls. anti-HA ELISA antibodies, anti-NP humoral responses and anti-M2 responses were observed after the rAd boost (p0.0001) compared to controls. significant anti-M2 humoral responses were detected in animals immunized with NP+M2 post-rAd boost (p = 0.0005) but not in the M2 alone group. only p-values less than 0.05 are indicated. the HA alone group elicited significant anti-HA immunity. the HA+NP+M2 group elicited similar anti-HA antibodies. iviral vector neutralizing assay, an HA inhibition assay, and a microneutralization assay. only HA-containing groups showed substantial neutralizing antibody titer responses. NP, M2 and NP+M2 groups showed no neutralization in each assay. at least nine weeks after the rAd5 boost, ferrets developed severe disease. HA immune responses alone were necessary and sufficient to protect ferrets from the lethal effects of infection under these challenge conditions. ferrets immunized three times with DNA followed by a rAd5 boost were challenged under anesthesia with 107 EID50/ferret of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004. NP and M2 have become a focus for the development of broad, cross-protective or \u201cuniversal\u201d influenza vaccines. in mice, several studies have shown that gene-based immunization with NP and M2 induce strong humoral and cellular responses. in mice, several studies have shown that gene-based immunization with NP and M2 induce strong humoral and cellular responses. d by immunization with NP in mice diminishes markedly as the dose and virulence of the challenge virus increase. a previous study has shown that vaccination with NP alone is capable of protecting mice against heterologous strains of influenza virus challenge, including H5N1. despite showing no neutralizing antibody responses, mice immunized with HA+NP+M2 were fully protected against lethal challenge. ferrets were immunized with HA alone, NP alone, M2 alone, NP+M2, HA+NP+M2 and control using gene-based vaccines delivered in DNA/rAd5 vectors. the efficacy of these immunogens was evaluated based on the measurement of neutralizing antibody titers through microneutralization and HA-inhibition assays. NP or NP+M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low dose viral challenges in ferrets. HA elicits effective immune protection even against very high HPAI viral challenge doses."}
