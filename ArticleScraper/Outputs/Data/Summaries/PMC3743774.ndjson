{"summary": "research has found that of all EIDs, 60.3% are zoonoses originating in wildlife and these represent the most significant global health threat. the countries of Southeast Asia have been hardest hit by HPAI H5N1. a technique, Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) analysis [17] and apply it to HPAI viruses within Vietnam\u2019s poultry trade system to explore the role that this approach may have in catalysing efforts to tackle emerging infectious disease outbreaks. we identify the key stages within the poultry trade chain which pose risks for the transmission of HPAI viruses in human and poultry populations. Principle 2 Identify Critical Control Points (CCPs) within the system. a CCP is a point in poultry trade which provides an opportunity to control, prevent or eliminate the risks for HPAI transmission. transportation and sale of poultry is considered a high-risk activity for HPAI transmission from poultry-to-poultry as well as poultry-to-humans. 2 Poultry may experience multiple transportation events across a large spatial scale throughout their lifetime. both modes of purchase are closely linked to the fourth risk category. Critical Control Points and Critical Limits CCPs were defined for each of the four risk stages identified during the HACCP assessment of Vietnam\u2019s poultry trade. each CCP is a point in the poultry trade which provides HPAI viruses with an opportunity for transmission between host animals. p denotes the Critical Control Point (CCP) is intended to reduce the opportunity for poultry-to-human HPAI transmission. the proposed critical limit for this transmission risk is a total ban on inter-flock mixing of birds throughout poultry transportation and sale. the suggested critical limit for this transmission risk is a total ban on inter-flock mixing of birds throughout poultry transportation and sale. contact within poultry flocks occurs at multiple stages within the trade. these potential viral \u2018mixing pots\u2019 exist when established flocks mix with newly recruited birds purchased by the owner; ii) flocks mix at a market; iii) birds mix at communal HPAI H5N1 vaccinations centres. poultry slaughtering and carcass preparation introduce poultry\u2013to-human HPAI transmission risks in the later stages of the trade chain. poultry consumption is a high-risk activity for HPAI transmission from poultry-to-humans if the infection is maintained in the raw or under-cooked tissue. p,h Isolation of birds, quarantine 2.Poultrytransportation&sale Transportation of live birds Transfer from householdp Flock isolation throughout Transportation of fighting cocks post-bout Transfer post-fightp,h Isolation 3.Poultrypurchase&slaughter Slaughter of birds Carcass disposalh, poultry slaughter, collection of bloodh Use protective equipment, follow hygiene protocols, avoid direct contact p denotes the CCP is intended to reduce the opportunity for poultry-to- poultry consumption is not a substantial risk for poultry-to-human HPAI transmission. consumption of raw blood pudding poses some of the highest risks for poultry-to-human transmission of HPAI viruses. the scope of Vietnam\u2019s poultry trade is far-reaching both geographically and across social classes. transmission of HPAI H5N1 between poultry appears to have shifted from the faecal/oral route towards the respiratory route [13] it has been noted that transmission of HPAI H5N1 between poultry appears to have shifted from the faecal/oral route to the respiratory route. the consumption of chicken and chicken products varies from that of ducks. uncooked duck blood is commonly consumed for special occasions. the practice has been implicated in poultry to human HPAI transmission. the HACCP framework enables the identification of risks within a system and the design of control methods. it does not contain the scope for monitoring or ensuring compliance of the control points identified. the framework enables the identification of risks within a system and the design of control methods. the framework enables the identification of risks within a system and the design of control methods. it does not contain the scope for monitoring or ensuring compliance of the control points identified. such control should be applied via other means."}
