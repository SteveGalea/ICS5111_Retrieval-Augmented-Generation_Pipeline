{"summary": "the events around the EVD cases have raised fundamental questions about the preparedness of the healthcare systems in advanced countries to handle the EVD epidemic. in the us, the patient was released from hospital even after he reported that he had travelled from Liberia only to be readmitted when his condition worsened. in the us, the patient was readmitted to the hospital, the first and only foreigner to succumb to EVD within the US. the treatment or lack of treatment of the liberian-born Ebola patient in the us has ignited somber thoughts of the past. many people, locally and internationally, have questioned the US public officials\u2019 moral high ground in asserting that the experimental ZMapp was unavailable for the treatment of the now deceased only non-US citizen-patient in the US soil. 410 15.6 4249 2458 Nigeria 173.6 54 56 521.8 2,710 5.7 20 8 Senegal 14.1 64 22 15.1 1,070 5.0 1 0 Sierra Leone 6.1 46 12 4.9 680 16.3 3252 1183 Spain 46.7 82 5 1,358.3 29,180 9.3 1 0 United States 316.1 79 10 16,800.0 53,670 17.7 3 1 Figure 1. the fact that the US is learning from Nigeria and Senegal is instructive the global South can teach the global North something. the outbreak teaches us that public and population health can no longer be defined in terms of national boundaries. the outbreak teaches us that public and population health can no longer be defined. a sophisticated healthcare system is important in handling an outbreak such as Ebola. but it is not a panacea to dealing with the attendant manageable fallouts of a rapidly unfolding outbreak. every citizen became the guard and guardian of the entire society. americans must learn from history and resist attempts to use the outbreak to alienate minorities and immigrant communities within their shores. americans must learn from history and resist attempts to use the outbreak to further alienate minorities and immigrant communities. the turn of events with the Ebola outbreak raise a number of issues relevant to our past and ongoing knowledge of global health. the global South can teach the global North something. the outbreak teaches us that public and population health can no longer be defined in terms of national boundaries. putting the \u201cP\u201d back in public health Third teaches us the critical importance of putting the \u201cP\u201d back in public health. the handling, or mishandling, of the outbreak both in the developing and the developed world teaches us the critical importance of putting the \u201cP\u201d back in public health. this is the \u201cP\u201d in public health in action. the western health officials must learn from their counterparts. the reality and effectiveness of planning is only evaluated when a healthcare system is confronted by the magnitude of an outbreak such as Ebola. governments must engage the public especially minorities, population characterized health disparities, and front line healthcare workers. the public health system must take immediate action to stem its failings in the handling of this volatile virus and its aftermath."}
