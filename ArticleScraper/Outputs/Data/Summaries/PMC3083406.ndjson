{"summary": "Google Flu Trends was developed to estimate US influenza-like illness rates from internet searches. but ILI does not necessarily correlate with actual influenza virus infections. most of the outlier observations occurred during the 2003\u201304 influenza season that was characterized by early and intense influenza activity. Google.org developed a model to estimate US influenza-like illness rates. the model was fit to CDC sentinel provider surveillance data for ILI from 2003 to 2007. it was prospectively validated using the same surveillance system during the 2007\u201308 influenza season. CDC Virus Surveillance consists of about 140 laboratories across the united states that report the weekly total specimens tested and laboratory tests positive for influenza virus. CDC Virus Surveillance is used in CDC statistical models in the estimation of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were then computed from these comparisons. additional correlation coefficients with 95% CI were then calculated from surveillance comparisons by influenza season, US Census Region, and influenza season categorized by US Census Region. correlation coefficients from the sensitivity analysis were compared to the same statistic from the primary analysis. results Our analyses used 166 weeks of data from the 2003\u201304 through the 2007\u201308 influenza seasons. data included five influenza seasons from 2003\u201304 through the 2007\u201308 influenza season. 2CDC Influenza-like Illness Surveillance involves a network of health care providers who record the weekly proportion of patients seen with ILI. 3CDC Influenza Virologic Surveillance consists of about 140 laboratories located throughout the united states that report the weekly total specimens tested and laboratory tests positive for influenza virus. there are 166 total observations in each panel. Influential observations were defined by DFBETA statistic greater than the absolute value of 2 divided by the square root of the total number of observations. the correlation coefficient describing the association between CDC surveillance ranged from 0.67 (95% CI 0.43, 0.82) during the 2003\u201304 influenza season to 0.94 (95% CI 0.89, 0.97) during the 2004\u201305 influenza season. the mean correlation coefficient for these comparisons was 0.79 (SD 0.13).

CDC surveillance is intensified from calendar week 40 through calendar week 20 of the subsequent year, we restricted our correlation analyses to this time period.
