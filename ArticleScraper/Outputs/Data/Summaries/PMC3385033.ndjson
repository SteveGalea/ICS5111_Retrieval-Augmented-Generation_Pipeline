{"summary": "DENV is a mosquito-borne member of the Flavivirus genus. it includes four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) the virus infects approximately 50 million individuals each year. infection results in a range of symptoms from mild fever to acute febrile illness. humanized mice provide a tractable animal model that permits in vivo infection of human cells with DENV. human T cells from infected NSG mice expressing the HLA-A2 transgene produced interferon- (IFN-) and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) upon stimulation with DENV peptides. NSG mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were irradiated (200 cGy) and received surgical implants under the kidney capsule of 1-mm3 fragments of HLA-A2-positive or negative human fetal thymus and liver. on the same day as the tissue transplant, CD34+ cells (1 105 to 5 105) were injected intravenously as a source of HSC to develop BLT-NSG mice. deNV-2 NGC was propagated in fetal calf serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at 28\u00b0 as previously described. groups of BLT-NSG mice were inoculated by the subcutaneous route. clinical assessments (weight loss and signs of illness including ruffling and hunching) were monitored for 30 days. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using a TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR-based TaqMan system. the RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using a TaqMan one-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit. peridinin chlorophyll protein-Cy5.5-hCD45 (clone 2D1), phycoerythrin-Cy7-mCD45 (clone 30-F11), FITC-hCD3 (clone UCHT1), phycoerythrin-hCD8 (clone RPAT4) antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. cells were stained with allophycocyanin-hIFN- (clone B27 -well microplates were coated overnight with 100 ng/well of deNV-2 E protein. plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min. a 1 : 20 dilution of sera diluted with PBS was added to the wells for 1 hr. each dilution was assayed in duplicate. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 in 5% CO2 for 1 hr. each well was washed with 1 ml PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum. NSG mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were irradiated (200 cGy) and received surgical implants under the kidney capsule of 1-mm3 fragments of HLA-A2-positive or negative human fetal thymus and liver. on the same day as the tissue transplant, CD34+ cells were isolated from autologous fetal liver using anti-human CD34+ microbeads. fetal calf serum containing 5% heat-inactivated heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at 28\u00b0 as previously described. groups of BLT-NSG mice were inoculated by the subcutaneous route with approximately 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) DENV-2 NGC or increasing doses of DENV-2 S16803 (106108 PFU) RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using a TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR-based TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) the RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using a TaqMan one-Step RT-PCR master mix reagents kit. rin-Cy7-mCD45 (clone 30-F11), FITC-hCD3 (clone UCHT1), phycoerythrin-hCD8 (clone H1T8a) and Pacific Blue-hCD4 (clone RPAT4) antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. cells were washed with FACS buffer, then permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer. the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min. a 1 : 20 dilution of sera diluted with PBS was added to the wells for 1 hr. each dilution was assayed in duplicate. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 in 5% CO2 for 1 hr. cells were pipetted to break up any clumps and centrifuged. BLT-NSG mice were implanted with human fetal thymus and liver. CD34+ cells isolated from autologous fetal liver were injected intravenously as a source of HSC. cells were identified using the phenotypic markers CD19 and CD20 on the CD3-negative population within the lymphocyte gate. values on the y-axis represent frequencies of (b) hCD45+, (c) hCD3+ and (d) hCD19+ CD20+ and CD19+ CD20 cells within the lymphocyte gate in the spleen (n = 16) and all cells in the bone marrow (n = 16) 104 to 57 107 copies/g RNA S16803 7 107 2/2 75 104 to 2 105 copies/g RNA S16803 7 108 5/7 120 104 to 65 106 copies/g of RNA BLT-NSG mice were inoculated with the indicated doses of DENV-2NGC or DENV-2 S16803. deNV-2-immunized mice were re-infected with deNV-2 NGC 2 months after primary infection. peptide pools NS2B and NS5 pool 2 (P = 006) stimulated T cells to secrete IFN-. es previously identified in humans, we selected mice that were engrafted with HLA A2+ tissues. we assessed IFN- responses in splenocytes from BLT-NSG mice stimulated with three peptides NS4B2353, NS4B2423 and NS4A2148. HLA-A2-restricted human T-cell responses in HLA-A2+ BLT-NSG mice. splenocytes were stimulated with 10 g/ml of NS4A2148, NS52582 peptides. cytokine production was assessed in an intracellular cytokine staining assay. high IgM responses were consistently validated in the sera of mice up to 8 weeks post-infection with DENV-2 NGC. no IgG responses were detected in the sera of mice immunized multiple times. 108 (open circles), 107 (open squares) or 106 (open triangles) PFU DENV-2 S16803 (a live-attenuated vaccine strain) infected mice with increasing doses of deNV-2 NGC and DENV S16803. Irrespective of the inoculation dose IgM responses were similar. n = 6) in supernatants obtained from splenocytes of infected mice. these data indicate that B cells generated following DENV infection of BLT-NSG mice can secrete DENV-specific antibodies that neutralize DENV infection. BLT-NSG mice had high-level engraftment of multiple human T-cell and B-cell populations in their bone marrow and spleen. the total percentages of human CD45+ ranged between 13 and 75% (median 50%, n = 16) in the spleen and 16\u201384% (median 53%, n = 16) in the bone marrow. infected mice infected with 108 PFU DENV-2 S16803 the titre peaked by day 14. no viral RNA was detected by day 35 in any mice tested. splenocytes from infected mice responded to multiple peptide pools by producing IFN-. mice were bled or killed at day 7. RNA was isolated from serum and subjected to one-step reverse transcription. peptide pools NS2B and NS5 pool 2 stimulated T cells to secrete IFN-. human T-cell responses in BLT-NSG mice were assessed by ELISA. splenocytes obtained from BLT-NSG mice 1 week after a second immunization with DENV-2 produced IFN- in response to these HLA-A2-restricted peptides. splenocytes obtained from BLT-NSG mice 1 week after a second immunization with DENV-2 produced IFN- in response to these HLA-A2-restricted peptides. splenocytes were stimulated with 10 g/ml of NS4A2148, NS52582 peptides, PMA or media. cytokine production was assessed in an intracellular cytokine staining assay. specific IgG was detected even 8 weeks post-infection with DENV-2 NGC. no IgG responses were detected in the sera of mice immunized multiple times. sera were obtained from deNV-2-infected and mock-infected mice. we found similar IgM antibodies in the sera of mice infected with DENV-2 NGC and DENV S16803. Irrespective of the inoculation dose IgM responses were similar. in all cases we detected low DENV-specific IgG responses. culture supernatants obtained 14 days later were used as a source of antibodies to perform ELISA and neutralization assays. splenocytes from naive mice were stimulated with CpG + interleukin-2 and Epstein\u2013Barr virus. B cells maintained long-term in immunized BLT-NSG mice were able to secrete deNV-specific neutralizing antibodies. we have not assessed germinal centre formation or somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes in B cells from BLT-NSG mice. there is variability in the infection rate and immunological responses detected in BLT-NSG mice. there is variability in the infection rate and immunological responses detected in BLT-NSG mice. we were unable to find a correlation between the degree of reconstitution of hCD45+ cells in the blood before infection and the ability of BLT-NSG mice to become productively infected. 50% of the human B cells in the periphery, but not in the bone marrow, express the CD5 antigen. recombinant viral envelope antigens stimulated production of antigen-specific human antibodies to west Nile virus and HIV gp140 that were predominantly of the IgM isotype."}
