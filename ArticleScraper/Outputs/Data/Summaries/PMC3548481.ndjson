{"summary": "introduction protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI)2 is an enzyme that localizes within the endoplasmic reticulum. PDI acts not only as a folding catalyst but also as a regulator of protein functions by changing the redox state of proteins. PDI switches the catalytic activity of enzymes such as NADPH oxidase (9, 10) and vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (11, 12). PDI is considered to act as a buffer of hormones via its high capacity and low affinity hormone-binding sites. PDIp is considered to serve as an effective modulator of the cellular levels and biological actions of endogenous estrogens. a previous study found that bisphenol A (BPA) also binds to PDI. overexpressed PDI traps T3 and inhibits activation of TR-mediated gene expression by PDI. redox factor1 (Ref-1), which changes the redox state of some transcription factors, contributes to the regulation of GH expression by PDI. the a and b\u2032 domains lack the a and b\u2032 domains. cDNAs were cut with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) the cDNA of the wild-type and C64S Ref-1 were cut with EcoRI and XhoI (for pCMV-HA) or BamHI and XhoI (for pcDNA-3FLAG) and ligated into pcDNA vector. the cDNA of TRX1 was amplified with primer 11 and primer 12.

GH levels in GH3 cells overexpressing PDI mutants were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 nm T3. GH mRNA levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0. GH protein levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0.

TR, TR1, or TR2 was overexpressed in GH3 and HEK293 cells. TR1 containing a 3FLAG tag was expressed in HEK293 cells. when unimmunized mouse serum was used, Ref-1 was not precipitated. this suggests that PDI interacts with Ref-1 via a disulfide bond. PDI oxidizes a cysteine residue of Ref-1 (produces a disulfide bond in Ref-1) a disulfide bond between the active motif of PDI and one cysteine residue (possibly Cys-93) of Ref-1 is formed first. if NEM blocks another cysteine residue of Ref-1 then the disulfide bond formation/cleavage reaction is stopped. blotting analyses of precipitated proteins were performed using anti Ref-1 (A), -PDI (B) or -ERp57 (C) antibody (Ab) Arrows indicate signals corresponding to Ref-1, PDI, and PDI. interaction between PDI and PDI was tested by immunoprecipitation. f-1 determined the redox state of Ref-1 in PDI-overexpressing cells. the reaction with PEG maleimide increased the protein mass by 5 kDa. cell extract was treated with NEM, and disulfide bonds were reduced by TCEP. however, PDI and Ref-1 were in the reduced state. a band of Ref-1 upshifted by 5 kDa was detected. we cannot explain why a band upshifted by 10 kDa was not detected. PDI or another protein binds to Ref-1 by a disulfide bond. purified Ref-1 and C64S Ref-1 were incubated with PDI. a band upshifted by 10 kDa was detected, suggesting that Ref-1 was oxidized by PDI. redox state of Ref-1 was not changed at 2GSH/GSSG ratios between 100 and 10. PDI overexpression also affects HIF-1-regulated gene expression. GH3 cells were cultured under normoxia (Nor) or hypoxia (Hyp) for 6 h. mRNA levels of VEGF were suppressed by overexpression of PDI. PDI is a T3-binding protein considered to act as a modulator of free T3 levels. this raises the possibility that increases in PDI protein levels in GH3 cells suppress the TR-mediated GH expression by trapping the T3. GH levels in GH3 cells overexpressing PDI mutants were set at 1.0. total RNA was isolated from three culture plates, and qRT-PCR was performed. GH protein levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0.

TR2 did not enhance the T3-mediated activation of promoter activity. ERp57 is a member of the PDI family and has a domain architecture similar to that of PDI. we predicted that PDI interacts with Ref-1 via a disulfide bond. PDI stops further reaction to catch the reaction intermediate, PDIRef-1 complex. interaction between PDI and Ref-1 was tested by immunoprecipitation. PDI was immunoprecipitated with Ref-1, suggesting that PDI interacts with Ref-1. ERp57 was also co-immunoprecipitated with Ref-1. HA-tagged wild type or C64S Ref-1 was expressed in the cell. expression levels in cells and immunoprecipitated amounts of Ref-1 were approximately equal between wild type and C64S. however, by substitution of Cys-64, the amount of co-precipitated PDI with Ref-1 was increased. PDI-overexpressing cells were cultured in the presence or absence of T3 for 24 h. proteins were harvested with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1% SDS. PDI-overexpressing cells were cultured in the presence or absence of T3 for 24 h. an upshift in molecular weight by binding of PEG-maleimide was detected. 5 m purified Ref-1 protein and 5 m PDI protein were co-incubated. asterisk indicates a nonspecific band. purified Ref-1 was incubated with 2 mm glutathione containing a mixture of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in different ratios. the redox state of Ref-1 was not changed at 2GSH/GSSG ratios between 100 and 10. the suppression of GH expression in GH3 cells is an indirect effect of BSO.

GH protein levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0. values are expressed as the mean S.D. (error bars) for three replicates. mRNA revels of GH were determined by qRT-PCR. changes in the redox state of their cysteine residues caused by Ref-1. the redox state of Ref-1 is known to be regulated by thioredoxin or ERp57. PDI is involved in the regulation of Ref-1. to test this hypothesis, the cysteine 64 residue in the N-terminal domain of Ref-1 is reported to be important. overexpression of Ref-1 or C64S Ref-1 in GH3 cells was checked by immunoblotting with an anti-Ref-1 antibody. wild-type Ref-1-overexpressing cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 nm T3. mRNA levels of intercellular GH were determined by immunoblotting. extracts from HEK293 cells overexpressed TR1 containing a 3FLAG tag. immunoblotting of precipitated proteins was performed using anti-FLAG antibody. Arrows indicate bands corresponding to TR1 and Ref-1. TR1 containing a 3FLAG tag was expressed in HEK293 cells. the promoter activity was suppressed by diamide-treated TR1-overexpressing HEK293 cells. this suggests that the transcriptional activity of TR1 is redox-sensitive. PDI is thought to make an internal disulfide bond with Cys-93. when PDI oxidizes a cysteine residue of Ref-1, a disulfide bond is formed. if NEM blocks another cysteine residue of Ref-1 then the disulfide bond formation/cleavage reaction is stopped. immunoblotting analyses of precipitated proteins were performed using anti-Ref-1 antibody. Arrows indicate signals corresponding to Ref-1, PDI, and ERp57. interaction between PDI and PDI was tested by immunoprecipitation. PDI changes the redox state of Ref-1 in PDI-overexpressing cells. the reaction with PEG maleimide increased the protein mass by 5 kDa. the reaction with PEG maleimide increased the protein mass by 5 kDa. a band of Ref-1 upshifted by 5 kDa was detected. the intensity of this band was increased by overexpression of PDI. we performed an in vitro experiment. changes in the redox state of wild-type Ref-1 and C64S Ref-1 by PDI were investigated using PEG maleimide. a band upshifted by 10 kDa was detected, suggesting that Ref-1 was oxidized by PDI. PDI also affects the HIF-1-regulated Gene Expression Ref-1. we investigated whether PDI overexpression also affects HIF-1-regulated gene expression. GH3 cells were cultured under normoxia (Nor) or hypoxia (Hyp) for 6 h. PDI is a T3-binding protein and considered to act as a modulator of free T3 levels. this raises possibility that increases in PDI protein levels in GH3 cells suppress the TR-mediated GH expression by trapping the T3. GH levels in GH3 cells overexpressing PDI mutants. A, GH3 cells overexpressing PDI mutants were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 nm T3. GH protein levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0. GH3 cells were treated with diamide and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of T3. the protein level of GH was also decreased in the presence of diamide. changes of the redox state by glutathione depletion affected GH expression slightly. GH3 cells were treated with 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mm BSO for 24 h. mRNA revels of GH were determined by qRT-PCR. mRNA expression of GH was elevated by Ref-1 over. redox state of Ref-1 has been proposed to be regulated by TRX1. TRX1 overexpression did not affect the GH expression, suggesting that TRX has little contribution to TR-mediated gene expression in GH3 cells. GH mRNA levels of mock cells without T3 were set at 1.0. values are expressed as the mean S.D. (error bars) for three replicates. luciferase reporter activity was measured. in GH3 cells, promoter activity was activated by T3, and the T3-induced activity was suppressed in the presence of 100 m diamide. in GH3 cells overexpressing TR1, promoter activity was suppressed by diamide, suggesting that transcriptional activity of TR1 is sensitive to the redox state. PDI interacts with Ref-1 via a disulfide bond. PDI has CGHC active motifs. if NEM blocks another cysteine residue of Ref-1 then the reaction is stopped. the disulfide bond between PDI and PDI is cleaved by reducing agents during SDS-PAGE. PDI was immunoprecipitated with Ref-1, suggesting that PDI interacts with Ref-1. ERp57 was also co-immunoprecipitated with Ref-1. interaction between PDI and C64S Ref-1 was tested by immunoprecipitation. HA-tagged wild type or C64S Ref-1 was expressed in the cell. expression levels in cells were approximately equal between wild type and C64S. PDI or Ref-1 were treated with DTT, PDI and Ref-1 were in the reduced state. however, when cells were treated with diamide, several upshifted bands appeared. the redox state of Ref-1 was not changed by T3 treatment. proteins were incubated with 2 mm PEG-maleimide (PEG-m) for 1 h. an upshift in molecular weight by binding of PEG-maleimide was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. asterisk indicates a nonspecific band. purified Ref-1 was incubated with 2 mm glutathione containing a mixture of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in different ratios. the redox state of Ref-1 was not changed at 2GSH/GSSG ratios between 100 and 10. GH3 cells were cultured under normoxia (Nor) or hypoxia (Hyp) for 6 h. mRNA levels of VEGF were determined by qRT-PCR. VEGF mRNA levels of mock-transfected cells without T3 were set at 1.0. PDI regulates the gene expression of GH by alternating the redox state of a cysteine residue (38). a change in redox state of a cysteine residue is also regulated by Ref-1. redox state of Ref-1 known to be regulated by TRX and thioredoxin reductase system. PDI also contributes to the change in the redox state of Ref-1. overexpression of PDI is considered to lead to the suppression of GH expression. in GH3 cells, the main regulator of Ref-1 is considered to be PDI. PDI changes the redox state of Cys-64 in Ref-1. mutation of Cys-64 eliminated the facilitation of GH expression via TR. PDI may act as a Ref-1 regulator in a wide range of Ref-1-mediated transcription events. but before PDI can be proposed as a general regulator of Ref-1, more studies are required."}
