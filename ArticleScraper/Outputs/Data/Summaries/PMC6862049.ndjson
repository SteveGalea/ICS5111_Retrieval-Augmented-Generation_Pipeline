{"summary": "PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. it is an enveloped virus with a 28 kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. genome contains 5\u2019-cap structures (n7-methyl guanosine and a methylation on the 2\u2019O position of the first nucleotide), a 3\u2019-poly(A) tail, and six known open reading frames (ORFs) encoding spike protein (S), accessory protein 3 (ORF3), envelope protein (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the polypeptides are protease-processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) PEDV strains caused moderate mortality in neonatal piglets and increased biosecurity practices on farms in the u.s. no PEDV vaccines have been developed in the u.s. since the 1980s. phylogenetic analyses of viral genomes separated the classical and emerging highly virulent PEDV strains into two distinct branches. the latter are classified as G2 or non-S insertion and deletion (INDEL) PEDV [19,25,30] no G1a strain has been identified in the u.s. whereas no G1a strain has been identified in the u.s.. PEDV strains are predominant in pig farms in Asian and american countries. the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) discovered that newborn piglets can be protected from the viral infection only through ingesting virus-specific antibodies in the colostrum and milk [50,51] of sows orally inoculated with the live TGEV. this information can be applied to the rational design of LAV candidates to prevent and control porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) YN144 PT-P96 KNU-141112 DEL5/ORF3 Nsp2 P509S K159N, T510I Nsp3 S1564F, I1565F, D1622G I1565T F1564S S1564F Nsp4 H2925Y E2937A Nsp5 T3186I Nsp6 V3505E Nsp7 A3627V Nsp12 L4622F V4832 mutations can be found in the sialic acid-binding domain S0 of PC22A-P120, PT-P96 and KNU-141112 DEL/ORF3. mutations can be found in the sialic acid-binding domain S0 of PC22A-P120, PT-P96 and KNU-141112 DEL/ORF3. mutations in the S protein may impair the recognition by the porcine receptor, contributing to the inefficient replication of these PEDVs in vivo. both YN144 and KNU-141112 DEL5/ORF3 contain deletions in their ORF3 gene, which also commonly exists in many vero cell-adapted G1 PEDV strains. protective efficacies of these reported PEDV LAV candidates have not been thoroughly evaluated in vivo. ideally, an efficacious PEDV LAV should induce protective lactogenic immune responses in sows. some studies lacked virulent PEDV-challenge data. a better version of PEDV candidates should contain the critical epitopes in the S protein that are conserved in the wild type (WT) viruses. the spread of progeny viruses to adjacent cells seems critical to the successful rescue of recombinant PEDVs in cell culture. the recombinant PC22A-transfected cells contained sufficient viral particles to infect neonatal piglets. the insertion resulted in the replacement of an aspartic acid by a glycine residue and the introduction of an additional histidine residue. a BAC vector infectious clone of a Thai G1a strain AVCT12 could be rescued only if the two intracellular signaling motifs were ablated. pAPN is not the cellular receptor for PEDV, but its peptidase activity facilitates the entry of PEDV into cells [7,8,74,75]. a PEDV infectious cDNA clone based on a highly virulent strain is a useful tool to study the molecular attenuation mechanisms of PEDV. studies have shown that vero cell-attenuated PEDVs replicate poorly in pigs. mutations in the S protein must be minimized without compromising attenuation. previous studies showed that the inactivation of the 2\u2019-O MTase sufficiently attenuates betacoronaviruses. this recombinant virus was partially attenuated in 5-day-old piglets. this recombinant virus lacked the function of regulating the dsRNA level. it antagonized the type I and type III interferon responses in cell culture. inactivation of the IFN-antagonistic function of other viral genes could also attenuate a CoV in vivo. recombinant MHV and SARS-CoV lacking the entire nsp2 were still viable in vivo. mutant MHV replicated normally in vitro and induced type I IFN. mutant MHV replicated slightly slower than WT virus. mutant MHV replicated slightly slower than WT virus. rSARS-CoV with both nsp1 (D motif) and E provide complete protection against homologous challenge [86] Nsp2 MHV and SARS-CoV Deletion of entire nsp2 Unknown The mutant viruses replicated less effectively compared with WT virus. PEDV H262A (MHV) or H226A (PEDV) Endonuclease The mutants induced early and robust IFN responses. yes MHV H262A (MHV) induced complete protection. sp14 and inactivated 2\u2019-O MTase function in nsp16 [82] help us develop a systematic strategy for the rational design of PEDV LAV candidates. target the genes that are not essential for viral replication and immunogenicity, such as the genes encoding modulators of innate immune responses. ideal PEDV LAV should replicate effectively in pig intestines, not cause diseases, induce enough protective immune responses and not revert to a virulent phenotype. in the future, rationally designed PEDV LAV candidates bearing different genetic modifications should be evaluated in pregnant sows."}
