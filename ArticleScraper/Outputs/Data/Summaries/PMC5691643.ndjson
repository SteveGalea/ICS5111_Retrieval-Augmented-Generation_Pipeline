{"summary": "alphaviruses belong to the alphavirus-like superfamily containing several families of +RNA viruses from animals or plants. alphaviruses form the family togaviridae together with the rubella virus, and they are mainly arthropod-borne viruses that infect vertebrates. the early RCs of alphaviruses are formed when the polymerase nsP4 is first cleaved from the nonstructural polyprotein. the resulting complex of P123 and nsP4 synthesizes minus-strand RNA using the genomic RNA as a template. it has been shown that the minus-strand RNA synthesized from the genomic template is inside the mature spherule. a partially uncleaved alphavirus replicase can form spherules in the absence of the RNA template. the template-independent spherule formation requires a combination of the uncleaved P123 and nsP4 or nsP1 or nsP4 or nsP4. a polymerase mutant (nsP4GAA) with its active site Gly-Ala-Ala (GDD) causes RNA II is produced both in cells and in vitro, but its function remains an unanswered question [25]. we applied the IVRA developed for CHIKV [25] to study the RNA synthesis of SFV. oligos were annealed, phosphorylated, and cloned into the XhoI site of pSFV1-ZsG, removing the ZsGreen gene. a larger piece containing the HA-insert was then transferred to pCMV-SFV4. the ZsGreen gene in constructs P123Z4 and P123Z4 [26] was replaced with an HA tag-containing Bsu36I-AgeI restriction fragment from the replicon. the ubi-nsP4 and the template Tmed constructs have been described in [26]. dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT. total RNA was isolated using acid phenol method. fluorographic detection of 3H-labeled RNA was performed. a membrane pellet (P15) and cytosolic fraction (S15) were prepared by further centrifugation of PNS (15,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) for the trans-replication system, BSR cells were co-transfected with the replicase and Tmed template plasmids containing the T7 promoter. after a 16-h incubation, cells were harvested by trypsinization. membranes present in PNS samples were purified by flotation centrifugation (90,000 g, 18 h, 4 \u00b0C) in a discontinuous iodixanol gradient consisting of 1 mL DB, 9 mL 30% (w/v) iodixanol in DB, and 2 mL 35% iodixanol in DB. RNA was extracted with acid phenol:chloroform, premixed with isopropyl alcohol, and washed with 70% ethanol. RNA was dissolved in 1 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.4; Ambion) agarose gel electrophoresis as described earlier [37] except that 1.0% (w/v) agarose gels were used. in-gel hybridization to detect RNA molecules from dried gels with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides was performed as described earlier. all 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was detected with the oligonucleotide probe 5\u2032-ATGCCCCCCCGGCCCTCTCT-3\u2032. gel was stripped between hybridizations by incubating in 1% SDS at 80 \u00b0C and confirming no signal remained by phosphorimaging. for SFV4-HA, a PCR product made using oligos 5\u2032-ATGTGGCAACATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAATAATAAAAATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATGACGGATGTGTGACATAC-3\u2032 was used as a template. the membranes were prehybridized in a hybridization mix [37] for 24 h at 55 \u00b0C. the membranes were prehybridized in a hybridization mix the 35S-l-methionine and 35S-l-cysteine labeling was performed using PNS prepared from mock BSR cells or cells co-transfected with P123HA4 and Tmed. the 35S-labeling was performed in the same buffer conditions as IVRA. membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SFV nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, or nsP4 [41] or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS with 5% milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20. secondary antibodies IRDye\u00ae 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) were used for fluorescent detection of primary antibodies 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1 mg/mL G418 (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Gibco) both cell lines were grown at 37 \u00b0C and in 5% CO2. atant was used to infect BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in MEM containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM l-glutamine. cells were washed twice and new medium was added. labeling of 6 105 mock- or SFV-infected cells was performed by incubating cells with 40 Ci of 3H-uridine in medium for 1 h. cells were lysed in lithium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT. total RNA was isolated using acid phenol method and analysed by denaturing aga a membrane pellet (P15) and cytosolic fraction (S15) were prepared by further centrifugation of PNS (15,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) for the trans-replication system, BSR cells were co-transfected with the replicase and Tmed template plasmids containing the T7 promoter. 12.4 g of P123HA4 or P123HA4 plasmid DNA per 10-cm dish. cells were harvested at 6 or 16 h post transfection. HA-affinity capture was performed as described in [38] except that the elution was done by boiling the beads in a sample buffer. oLock, 17 mM creatine phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 8.3 U/mL creatine phosphokinase (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM ATP, 10 M UTP, 10 M GTP, 8.5 M CTP, and 0.055 M (5 Ci) of -32P-CTP (Perkin Elmer) for IVRA with exogenous template RNA, an in vitro transcript of Tmed was prepared using isolated RNA was dissolved in 1 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.4; Ambion) RNA was analysed by denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was analysed by denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. all 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was detected with the oligonucleotide probe 5\u2032-ATGCCCCCGGCCCTCTCT-3\u2032. gel was stripped between hybridizations by incubating in 1% SDS. pEAV221 was obtained by cleaving pEAV221 [39] with HindIII and ligating the 4729-bp fragment. for SFV4-HA, a PCR product made using oligos 5\u2032-ACGTGGCAACATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAATAATAAAAATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATGACGGATGTGACATAC-3\u2032 was used as a template. a nucleotide mix containing 20 M ATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP and 0.12 M (10 Ci) of -32P-CTP (Perkin Elmer) were used. the 35S-l-methionine and 35S-l-cysteine labeling was performed using PNS prepared from mock BSR cells. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 4% and 10% (w/v) acrylamide concentrations in the stacking and separation gels. membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SFV nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, or nsP4 [41] or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody against -actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a cytosolic marker. SFV-infected cells were harvested at 4\u20135 h.p.i. and homogenized in isotonic buffer to prepare PNS. cytosolic marker -actin and 18S rRNA were predominantly found in the S15 fractions. post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared at 4 h post infection (p.i.) equivalent amounts of PNS, P15, and S15 were analysed from mock- and SFV-infected cells. data are a representative example of two independent experiments. the genomic RNA was the major product synthesized in vitro. RNA II was only detected in the 32P-labeled reaction products of the in vitro assay. this might be due to the short half-life of RNA II in the infected cells. cleavage sites between nsP1 and nsP2 as well as nsP2 and nsP3 have been mutated. the active site of the nsP2 protease has been mutated. nsP4 is expressed from a separate plasmid as an ubiquitin\u2013nsP4 fusion. polyprotein P123 was recognized using anti-nsP3 antibody. nsP2 band was found in the membrane fraction (80%) in contrast to nsP2 in cells infected with SFV or transfected with the wild-type replicase. distribution and stability of endogenous minus- and plus-strand RNA in P15 and S15 fractions prepared from transfected BSR cells. total RNA was isolated from equivalent amounts of PNS, P15, and S15 followed by in-gel hybridization with probes that detect either minus- or plus-strand RNA. numbers below the lanes indicate the percentage of 32P-signal in genomic RNA compared to the untreated sample. type replicase and Tmed contained significantly higher amounts of plus-strand RNA compared to the uncleavable replicase. in both cases, the S15 fraction contained more plus-strand RNA, while the minus-strand RNA was distributed more evenly. this confirms that the minus-strand RNA was mostly protected from the nucleases and not in a freely accessible form. the template was highly active in synthesizing both genomic and subgenomic RNA. RNA II was not observed due to its short half-life in combination with a lower activity of the RCs from transfected cells compared to those from infected cells. RNA species were compared to in vitro transcripts of SFV or Tmed. a capture probe corresponding to 1\u20132042 nt of EAV genome was used as a (negative) control for binding specificity. RNA probes with the sequence of the 3\u2032 end of the SFV genome were immobilized on membranes. as a negative control, an unrelated transcript (equine arteritis virus) was also immobilized. membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled SFV transcripts of positive or negative polarity. metabolic labeling was performed on mock PNS, heat-inactivated mock PNS and PNS prepared from BSR cells co-transfected with the wild-type replicase and Tmed template. synthesis of 35S-labeled proteins was readily detected in mock PNS and replicase-expressing PNS. PNS samples were incubated with 35S-l-methionine and 35S-l-cysteine. a Phosphor Imager screen was exposed to the same gel as in A to detect 35S-labeled proteins. the results of two independent experiments are shown. the polyprotein P123 or nsP4 did not bind to the agarose beads. however, nsP4 did not bind in this case either, indicating that bound nsP3 was not in a complex with the other nsPs. we then tested the purification of membranes using flotation centrifugation in an iodixanol step-gradient. the presence of polyprotein P123, nsP3, nsP4 and -actin in the PNS and membrane fractions was studied by Western blotting. a Western blot analysis shows the presence of P123, nsP3 and -actin in the PNS and membrane fractions. we pre-incubated P1234 replicase-containing membrane preparations with an exogenous template for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C before the reaction was performed. none of these experimental variations resulted in the replication of the exogenous template. in-gel hybridizations showed that the P15 fraction contained the majority (80%) of the minus-strand RNA present in the PNS. a minor fraction of the genomic plus-strand RNA (20%) was found in P15. the RNA-synthesizing activity present in the PNS, P15, and S15 fractions was analysed by measuring the incorporation of 32P-CTP into viral RNA in an IVRA. RNA II was only detected in the 32P-labeled reaction products of the in vitro assay, not in the 3H-uridine-labeled viral RNA synthesized in cells. the factors in the S15 fraction are dispensable for replication. the differential centrifugation likely caused damage to RCs. the slight boost after mixing P15 and S15 was most likely due to the cellular NTP pool present in S15. nsP4 was enriched in P15 (50\u201370%), except in P1234GAA, where the majority of nsP4 was found in S15 (80%) Approximately 30% and 20% of nsP2 and 50 and 40% of nsP3 were found in P15 of P1234 and P1234GAA, respectively. the only major difference observed between cells transfected with the two uncleavable constructs was that the P12CA3 + nsP4-transfected cells contained more nsP4. at 16 h post transfection, PNS was prepared and fractionated into P15 and S15. nsPs were detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies. no signal was detected when RNA from mock-transfected or P1234GAA + Tmed-transfected cells was analysed. both minus- and plus-strand RNA were detected in PNS when the wild-type replicase and uncleavable constructs together with the template were expressed. minus-strand RNA was mostly protected from the nucleases and not in a freely accessible form. this confirms the idea that the plus-strands in replicative intermediates within the RC are membrane-protected. in P15 the plus-strand RNA was protected, while they are released from the RCs into the cytosol in a more nuclease-sensitive form. the higher expression levels of nsP4 most likely explain why P12CA3 + nsP4 produced more labeled RNA than P1234. in vitro activity of replication complexes formed by expressing different SFV replicase constructs and a template in the trans-replication system. the IVRA products made by RCs from P1234 + Tmed-transfected cells showed significant binding only to the plus-RNA capture probe. the binding was approximately 67% of the binding to the plus-RNA capture probe detected with P1234 + Tmed. the signal generated by this uncleavable replicase was mostly due to some background activity. the binding of the IVRA products made by replication complexes was normalized to the binding of the IVRA products made by RCs from P1234 or P1234GAA + Tmed-transfected cells. the binding of the IVRA products made by RCs from P1234 or P1234GAA + Tmed-transfected cells was normalized. in vitro RNA-synthesizing activity is not dependent on translation. in vitro RNA-synthesizing activity is not dependent on translation. in vitro RNA-synthesizing activity is not dependent on translation. the results of one of two independent experiments are shown. we expressed the uncleavable construct P1234 without the template RNA in BSR cells. the membrane fraction prepared from the cells harvested at 6 h post transfection contained more in vitro transcript than the sample prepared 16 h post transfection. despite the fact that template RNA was still present at the end of the reaction, no incorporation of 32P-CTP into viral RNA was detected. ous template is shown for PNS prepared from cells co-transfected with the P1234 and Tmed constructs. the lower panel shows the presence of exogenous Tmed transcript in the membrane fractions after the IVRA. we also used BHK-21 cells that were transfected with plasmids that express replicase proteins under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. a minor amount of plus-strand RNA is made, and it is also possible that RCs finish initiated minus strands. the prepared PNS is highly active in vitro and synthesizes RNA of positive polarity, both genomic and subgenomic, indicated by the orange arrows. highly active RNA synthesis was observed in vitro only when RCs were isolated from cells containing the fully processed SFV replicase. endogenous minus strands and replication activity were found in membrane fraction prepared from SFV-infected cells. endogenous plus strands were more abundant in the cytosolic fraction. the same has been observed with CHIKV-infected cells. minus strands represent RCs, suggesting the partially uncleaved replicase is able to make significantly higher numbers of RCs compared to the wild-type replicase. this suggestion is in line with the requirement of partially uncleaved replicase to form spherules without the template [29] western blotting showed that in all replicase constructs the polymerase nsP4 was enriched in the membrane fraction. translation inhibitors did not boost replication either. in SFV-infected cells, translation inhibitors cause selective shut off of the minus-strand RNA synthesis. however, overproduction of the nonstructural proteins does not lead to increased RNA synthesis in SFV-infected cells. NS4B is a membrane protein, and the scaffolding protein HCV RCs and affinity capture resulted in an enrichment of DMVs capable of the de novo synthesis of HCV RNA. however, we also probed a similar approach to isolate SFV replicase proteins by tagging nsP3 which is known to tolerate insertions. SINV nsP4 purified from Escherichia coli synthesizes RNA in vitro. if combined with a P123-membrane fraction and template RNA, replicase proteins can replicate exogenous spherules. it will be important to compare this system to the vaccinia virus-based expression system used in previous studies. vo RNA synthesis indicates that RC assembly is achievable if the template RNA is provided before nsP4 has associated with the polyprotein P123."}
