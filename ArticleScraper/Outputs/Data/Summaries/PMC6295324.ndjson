{"summary": "the Coronaviridae family comprises enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales with a genome of up to 32 kb in length. the family is divided into six genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. a viral genome by the collection of encoded protein domains is a potentially useful classification method that we would like to explore in more detail. each domain family is defined by a manually selected and aligned set of protein sequences, which is used to construct a profile HMM of the domain. the Virus Pathogen Resource site has a useful compilation of Pfam domains found in specific virus families. the catalog is currently limited to fourteen virus families. the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) currently recognizes ninty-six virus families. study setting and design Fecal pellets from Scotophilus kuhlii bats were collected from roosts on bat guano farms in the Dong Thap province in southern Vietnam. samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until processed for NGS. the CTD or CATD domain content plus the contig length (500 nt, 3,000 nt, 10,000 nt, 20,000 nt) were used as a triage to classify fragments as \u2018Coronaviridae\u2019 or \u2018not Coronaviridae\u2019. sensitivity (true positive/true positive + false negative) and specificity (true negative/true negative + false positive) for each combined triage and classification method were determined based on the original identity de novo assembly and identification of Coronaviridae contigs Raw sequencing reads were assembled into contigs using de novo assembly with SPAdes 3.10. coverage was estimated for contigs followed by additional filtering for minimum contig size cutoff (300 nt) geneBanka Corona_ genus Host Host_species Farm_ID Collection_ date District Total_qc_ reads(for)b Mapped_ readsc Genome_ length (nt) ophilus kuhlii 98 17-Jun-2014 Cao Lanh 2,723,720 16,651 28,321 16715_5 MH687943 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 99 10-Jun-2014 Cao Lanh 2,556,708 32,056 28,272 16715_53 MH687944 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 99 10-Jun-2014 cao Lanh 3,260,590 6, cao Lanh 2,334,464 5,629 27,225 16715_86 MH687953 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 55 11-Jun-2014 Chau Thanh 2,643,553 79,660 28,747 16845_24 MH687954 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 55 18-Sep-2014 Chau Thanh 2,794,660 4,334 28,333 16845_47 MH687955 Alpha Bat Sco 3,800 28,053 20724_95 MH687963 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 99 6-Feb-2015 Cao Lanh 7,568,967 11,331 28,169 20745_10 MH687964 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii 99 6-Feb-2015 Cao Lanh 1,043,879 6,913 28,210 20745_17 MH687965 Alpha Bat Scotophilus kuhlii argentiventer 65 12-Nov-2014 Tam Nong 6,703,538 68,652 31,389 20724_43 MH687974 Beta Rat Rattus argentiventer 65 12-Nov-2014 Tam Nong 255,794 27,831 31,224 22054_56 MH687975 Beta Rat not available. bTotal read mapped to final genome. a set of seventy-nine Pfam domains were found at least once in a Coronaviridae genome. a set of seventy-nine Pfam domains were found at least once in a Coronaviridae genome. domain frequencies in the set of 2,255 Coronaviridae genomes were reported. pfam13604 AAA_30 2,438 CTD pfam01443 Viral_helicase1 2,427 CTD pfam01661 Macro 2,390 CTD pfam01600 Corona_S1 6,838 abundant pfam01601 Corona_S2 5,446 abundant pfam00937 Corona_nucleoca 4,993 abundant pfam01635 Corona_M 3,794 abundant pfam087 34 moderate pfam02723 NS3_envE 495 moderate pfam03620 IBV_3C 474 moderate pfam08779 SARS_X4 414 moderate pfam11289 APA3_viroporin 390 moderate pfam09399 SARS_lipid_bind 387 moderate pfam11501 Nsp1 371 moderate pfam12124 Nsp3_PL2pro 371 moderate cCATD, Coronaviridae Absolute Triage Domain; CTD, Coronaviridae Triage Domain. abundant, moderate, and rare indicate the frequency of the domain in all Coronaviridae genome sequences. HMMER3 hmmsearch (Eddy 2011) was applied to the set of peptides, screening against the database of Coronaviridae Pfam domains. for domain hits with e-values 0.01, the Pfam domain scores were collected into an array organized by genera. an RF model using these six genera sets was then trained and built from 1,000 random trees. the set was derived from 492 full genomes (12 genomes from each of 40 virus families) plus 2 genomes from each of the six Coronaviridae genera. 300 random fragments in the size range from 500 nt to full genome size were prepared, combined resulting in a total of 111,577 fragments. 111,577 viral genome fragments including 3,316 Coronaviridae fragments were used as a triage to classify fragments as \u2018Coronaviridae\u2019 or \u2018not Coronaviridae\u2019. the sensitivity (true positive/true positive + false negative) and specificity (true negative + false positive) for each combined triage and classification method were determined based on the original identity of the input genomes. unprotected (non-encapsidated) DNA in the samples was degraded by addition of 20 U TURBO DNase (Ambion) remaining nucleic acid was subsequently extracted using the Boom method. phenol/chloroform extraction was performed using 5 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) the table includes for each genome the genome id and GenBank accession number, and the Coronaviridae genus as identified by the tool described in this article. also included are the host species, the sample collection date, and location data. h 2,235,269 11,042 28,307 16715_45 MH687940

the initial triage contigs using a full genome Coronaviridae genera training set as follows. for all full genomes in each of the six Coronaviridae genera, all six open reading frames were translated and peptides 100 amino acids in length were collected. the process of HMMER3 domain identification, the encoding of the domain content into a matrix and the RF classification against all available Coronaviridae genomes was incorporated into a single, platform-independent Docker image. the tool can be downloaded and installed on any computing platform (Unix, Mac, Windows) and includes all required dependencies. panel A: two examples of Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Toro- and Bafinivirus were selected. all protein domains encoded by the full genomes, detected by profile HMMs, were identified. panel B: the Coronaviridae Absolute Triage Domains (CATDs) are marked with an orange, the frequent Pfam domains are marked in shades of green and the rare Pfam domains are marked in gray. the protein domain repertoire is plotted as the frequency of each domain in all available full genomes from all Coronaviridae genera. each row represents a protein domain, each column represents a Coronaviridae genus. the utility of domain content for Coronaviridae classification was first tested by developing a simple triage method to identify potential Coronaviridae sequence contigs. we ran each classification process five times to control for random selection of features. the analyses were run with four size cutoff classes. highest sensitivity/specificity values were obtained with the CTD_all triage. de novo assembled contigs from rat and bat sample data sets were processed using a triage followed by machine learning classification to the Coronaviridae genus level. about forty-five samples contained Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus sequences with probabilities > 0.5 (darker blue in the heatmap) two groups of Betacoronavirus were identified in rat samples. the closest available virus genome in GenBank was the Betacoronavirus_HKU24. the next closest coronaviruses were the human coronavirus OC43 and the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) the tree is mid-point rooted for clarity and only bootstraps 70 per cent are shown. horizontal branch lengths are drawn to the scale of nucleotide substitutions per site. phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Vietnamese bat Alphacoronavirus belonged to two lineages. viruses in the second lineage are more related to the rat CoV strains Longquan-189 (KF294370) and -370 (KF294371) and rat CoVs from china (KY370051, KY370049, KY37048, and KY370043). a more comprehensive description of Coronaviridae diversity is an important objective. the classification tool provides a robust, rapid, and alignment-free method to classify large sets of more distantly related sequences. the algorithm can be used in the field or resource-limited settings and can be performed with typical contig sets within minutes on a standard laptop. the sample collection was from the Dong Thap province in southern Vietnam. forty-four complete or nearly complete genomes belonging to the Coronaviridae family were identified. the total individual bats samples screened ranged from 885 to 1,770. the zoonotic potential of these reported viruses is yet to be defined. the bat Alphacoronaviruses described here had only a single genome available in GenBank and we have enriched the public database with thirty-four additional genomes. been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MH687934\u2013MH687978."}
