{"summary": "excitatory amino acid glutamate serves as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). excitotoxicity and oxidative toxicity are considered to be two major pathways responsible for glutamate-induced toxicity. glycyrrhiza Radix exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects (10,11) several signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (14,15). ERKs and mitochondria-related pathways are essential for GA-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. ulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 10% horse serum (HS, Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL, Invitrogen) PC12 cells were differentiated with 20 ng/mL nerve growth factor for 48 h. the viability of treated cells are reported as a percentage of that from corresponding control cells. western blotting Treated cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. proteins were separated using 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. transferred membranes were then blotted with antibodies as follows. PC12 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 1104 cells/well. cells were incubated with MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in the dark. 3,3\u2032 tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Sigma-Aldrich) staining was used to measure MMP changes. cells were seeded onto six-well plates at 1105 cells/well. cells were pretreated with 6.25 or 12.5 M GA for 3 h. cells were cotreated with glutamate for another 12 h. phospho-ERKs (P-ERKs), total-ERKs (T-ERKs), phosphor-AKT (P-AKT), total-AKT (T-AKT), Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3, Cyto C, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (all 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by treatment with horseradish only 21.28.7% (P0.001) MMP was observed in glutamate-treated cells. 6.25 and 12.5 M GA pretreatment significantly restored MMP to 69.912.9% (P0.01) and 36.16.9% (P0.05), respectively. glutamate-reduced Bcl-2 levels to 102.312.7 or 95.110.9% (P0.05), normalized glutamate-increased Bax expression to 78.74.4 or 80.36.4% (P0.01), inhibited caspase 3 activity to 119.410.1% or 112.310.9% (P0.05), and suppressed Cyto C release to 102.27.9. ERK activation was involved in the glycyrrhizic acid (GA)-mediated neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced differentiated PC12 cell damage. ERKs but not the AKT pathway were involved in the glycyrrhizic acid (GA)-mediated neuroprotective effect against differentiated PC12 cell damage. ERKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; AKT: protein kinase B; P-AKT: phosphor-AKT; T-AKT: total-AKT. data are reported as a percentage (meanSD) of that from corresponding control cells (n=3). only 21.28.7% (P0.001) MMP was observed in glutamate-treated cells. Conversely, 6.25 and 12.5 M GA pretreatment significantly restored MMP to 69.912.9% (P0.01) and 36.16.9% (P0.05), respectively. 119.83.2% (P0.05) in cells exposed to 20 mM glutamate for 24 h. GA pretreatment strongly restored glutamate-reduced Bcl-2 levels to 102.312.7 or 95.110.9% (P0.05) GA pretreatment (6.25 M) reversed the decrease in P-ERKs caused by glutamate. neuroprotective effect of 6.25 M GA on cell viability was significantly abrogated. ERKs but not the AKT pathway were involved in the glycyrrhizic acid-mediated neuroprotective effect against differentiated PC12 cell damage. with 6.25 M GA for 3 h and exposure to 20 mM Glu for 24 h. cells were then collected for measurement of cell viability using the MTT method. neither GA alone nor cotreatment with glutamate showed any effect on P-AKT levels. GA improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, and normalized expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase 3 and Cyto C compared with glutamate-treated cells. ERK signaling pathway is essential in GA-mediated neuroprotection. caspase 3 is activated in the cytosol and is translocated into the nucleus to cleave its nuclear substrates. mitochondria-related pathways are involved in GA-mediated neuroprotection. however, the relationship between ERK activation and mitochondrial function needs further study. our findings provide experimental evidence that GA may be a candidate for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases."}
