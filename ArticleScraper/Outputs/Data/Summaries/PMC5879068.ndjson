{"summary": "pseudovirus is a type of retrovirus that can integrate with the envelope glycoprotein of another type of virus to form a new virus with an exogenous viral envelope. compared with natural viruses, pseudoviruses can only accomplish one infection cycle because they lose their self-replicating ability. pseudovirus preparation is thus an effective, safe, and reliable method for application in the study of viruses with high pathogenicity. viral isolation, hemagglutination inhibition assays, agar gel immunodiffusion assays, and complement fixation assays are the primary methods used to detect RVFV. commonly used coating antigens include the envelope protein (Gn) and inactivated RVFV. this method can only preliminarily detect antibody levels in humans. pUC57-Simple-M recombinant plasmid was synthesized by Sangon Biotech (China) the obtained DNA fragment was subject to double digestion and was then ligated into a double-digested eukaryotic expression plasmid. in 10 mL of modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, USA) the cells were then cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. when cell growth reached 80% to 90% confluence, 5 g of the lentiviral plasmid pLV-EGFP-C, 3.75 g of the PH1 plasmid (Invitrogen) and 1.25 g of the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-M the RVFV pseudovirus packaging conditions were identified by using electron microscopy and western blotting. the harvested pseudoviruses or pseudovirus concentrates were first adsorbed to a copper grid and then stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. after the residual staining solution was absorbed by filter paper, the pseudovirus particles were observed by using an electron microscope. the same virus solution-based measurement method was used to determine the viral titers. the cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a density of 5 104 cells/well and cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. each dilution was added to three replicate wells. the antibody and RVFV/vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G pseudovirus solution (500 IU) were mixed at equal volumes, added to 96-well cell culture plates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the mixture was added to 293T cells in the logarithmic growth phase at 100 L/well. the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression plasmid was obtained from the animal virology and special disease research laboratory. the plasmid was ligated into a double-digested eukaryotic expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-M-rvfv) mL of modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo, USA) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. when cell growth reached 80% to 90% confluence, 5 g of the lentiviral plasmid pLV-EGFP-C, 3.75 g of the PH1 plasmid (Invitrogen) and 1.25 g of the the RVFV pseudovirus packaging conditions were identified by using electron microscopy and western blotting. the harvested pseudoviruses or pseudovirus concentrates were first adsorbed to a copper grid and then stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. after the residual staining solution was absorbed by using filter paper, the pseudovirus particles were observed by using an electron microscope. the same virus solution-based measurement method was used to determine the viral titers. the cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a density of 5 104 cells/well and cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. each dilution was added to three replicate wells. the antibody and RVFV/vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G pseudovirus solution (500 IU) were mixed at equal volumes, added to 96-well cell culture plates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the mixture was added to 293T cells in the logarithmic growth phase at 100 L/well and mixed thoroughly. one band was present at approximately 3200 bp, which was consistent with the size (3218 bp) of the expected target fragment. results showed two nucleic acid bands, at approximately 3200 bp and 5500 bp, consistent with the target gene fragment. virus solution harvested after 48 to 72 h of co-transfection of mixed lentiviral plasmids and 293T cells. spherical particles with an envelope of 80 to 120 nm diameter were observed by using an electron microscope. both particle morphology and structure were consistent with previously reported descriptions of human immunodeficiency virus lentiviral vectors [1,12] the detection results showed that the RVFV pseudovirus titer was 1 106 IU/mL. Fig. 5 shows positive fluorescence expression in 293T cells infected with different fold dilutions. RVFV pseudoviruses were reacted with serial dilutions of positive mouse serum to measure the neutralizing antibody titer. serum samples from mice immunized with RVFV proteins all had 100% neutralization activity in the 2- to 16-fold dilution range. the correct target gene band was amplified by PCR. pcDNA3.1-M-rvfv plasmid was digested with the Not I and Kpn I enzymes. results showed two nucleic acid bands at approximately 3200 bp and 5500 bp. spherical particles with an envelope of 80 to 120 nm diameter were observed by using an electron microscope. both particle morphology and structure were consistent with previously reported descriptions of human immunodeficiency virus lentiviral vectors. western blotting was performed to determine whether the acquired viral particles were RVFV pseudoviruses. Fig. 5 shows positive fluorescence expression in 293T cells infected with different fold dilutions of the RVFV pseudoviruses. Fig. 5 shows positive fluorescence expression in 293T cells infected with different fold dilutions of pseudoviruses. positive serum samples from mice immunized with RVFV proteins all had 100% neutralization activity in the 2- to 16-fold dilution range. diluted 32-fold neutralized 70% of the virus infection, while 64-fold serum dilution neutralized approximately 15% of the virus infection. however, the RVFV-positive mouse serum did not inhibit VSV pseudovirus infection. assays involve tedious work, including culture of the virus, which can be performed only in biological safety level 3 laboratories. so, safety issues associated with RVFV are an important problem that has drawn considerable attention. recently, pseudovirus technology has become a very effective tool in scientific research [6,7,14] and has demonstrated several unique application advantages. the present study used a lentiviral packaging system and recombinant expression plasmids to construct RVFV pseudoviruses. the infective activity of the obtained RVFV pseudoviruses was inhibited by specific antibodies. the RVFV pseudovirus neutralization assay established in this study effectively evaluated antibody titers in positive mouse serum."}
