{"summary": "avian coronavirus has a wide range of hosts, from chickens and turkeys to wild birds. this virus causes an economically and possibly, environmentally, important loss in the poultry industry. at present, there has been limited information about avian coronavirus among birds. avian coronavirus is the main representative of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales. the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is among the most researched. it causes respiratory disease while also affecting the kidneys and reproductive tract. there has been limited information about viral diseases among Eclectus parrots. there is limited information as to whether avian coronaviruses cause diseases in Psittacine birds. allantoic fluid was harvested on day 4 post-inoculation and stored at 20\u00b0C until use. RNA was dissolved in 30 l RNase-free water and used for amplification by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. annealing occurred at 48\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 50\u00b0C for 30 s. nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared with the S1 gene available from GenBank. nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared with the S1 gene. the genes used in the analysis are listed in Table-2. phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method.

[17] was conducted in East Java. the study by Setiawaty et al. [22] was conducted in west Java. this might explain why we were able to isolate an IB-like virus. despite 100% homology on the site we sequenced, differences in other parts of the genome may cause differences in virulence. the birds sampled appeared to be healthy, but it is unknown whether the isolated virus can cause infection in chickens. the birds were also born and bred in the same institution, so the path of infection is unknown. transmission of the virus to wild birds has likely happened due to poor biosecurity in poultry farms and improper disposal of litter and waste. contamination from improper disposal of litter and waste may ease transmission from domesticated poultry to wild birds. emergence and spread of highly pathogenic AI often contribute to its presence in wild birds. this study is the first to have studied IBV in a species other than chicken in Indonesia. the similarity between viruses isolated from captive birds and domesticated poultry is alarming. there is an indication of a reverse spillover effect that has already happened from poultry farms to the environment."}
