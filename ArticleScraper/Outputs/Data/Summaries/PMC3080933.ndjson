{"summary": "particle size distributions from 3 nm to 1 m; PM10 (PM 10 m), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide concentrations. daily counts of emergency room visits (ERV) for respiratory diseases were obtained from the Peking University Third Hospital. the sampling system was placed 20 m above ground on top of a six-floor building. local emission sources within a 1-km radius include vehicular traffic and fuel combustion for domestic cooking, heating, and construction. size-dependent losses for the TDMPS inlet line were estimated using empirical particle loss corrections (diffusion and gravitation) from Willeke and Baron (1993) Losses of 4-nm and 10-nm particles were estimated to be 35% and approximately 10%, respectively. a database was built on the basis of these files, and respiratory clinical end points were coded according to the ICD-10 codes. total respiratory ERV comprise acute upper respiratory infections (J00\u2013J06), pneumonia (J18), acute bronchitis (J20), other diseases of the upper respiratory tract (J30\u2013J39), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40\u2013J47). the percentage of misclassification was about 4%. the base model was selected according to Akaike\u2019s information criterion (Akaike 1974) nonlinear effects were modeled by regression splines with an automatic smoothness selection. the smoothness of the trend function was manually adjusted based on the absolute value of the sum of the partial autocorrelation function. analyses were done using the mgcv package in the R software (R Development Core Team 2003), version 2.90. the sample system was placed 20 m above ground on top of a six-floor building. local emission sources within a 1-km radius include vehicular traffic and fuel combustion for domestic cooking, heating, and construction. a low-flow PM10 inlet was used to minimize contamination by large dust particles. a low-flow PM10 inlet was dried in a diffusion drier before entering the air-conditioned laboratory. data were corrected for losses due to diffusion and sedimentation. loss of 4-nm and 10-nm particles estimated to be 35% and approximately 10%. patients within 10 km of the measurement site were likely to be treated. the data acquisition system of the hospital recorded only patients who did not stay longer than 1 day. the data acquisition system of the hospital recorded only patients who did not stay longer than 1 day. we accounted for time-delayed effects of these variables using arithmetic means for days up to 7 days before the visit. additional influences of the year, season (December\u2013February, March\u2013May, June\u2013May, June\u2013August, September\u2013November), month, day of the month and holiday were investigated. the daily mean of respiratory ERV was 15, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 88 patients per day. the time series of respiratory ERV showed a seasonal and weekly pattern, with more cases during the cold season and a peak on the weekend and on holidays. 88 6 600 100 NO2 (g/m3) 1,036 63 38 5 290 40 PM10 (g/m3) 1,036 120 83 10 570 90 UFP (1/cm3) 818 22,000 9,800 5,600 76,000 11,000 PNCtotal (1/cm3) 818 29,000 10,000 7,400

temperature, relative air humidity, and SO2. small negative correlations between NO2 and PNC3\u201310 and PNC10\u201330 (0.09) and a moderate positive correlation between NO2 and PNC30\u201350 (0.22) and PNC50\u2013100 (r = 0.43) effect estimates for an IQR increase in NO2 were similar in magnitude to estimates for IQR increases in particle number and surface area concentrations of particles > 100 nm. in most cases PNC50\u2013100 was positively associated with respiratory ERV based on PDL models. 5% CI) SO2 Same day 100 1.01 (0.97\u20131.05) 1.00 (0.96\u20131.04) 1.01 (0.97\u20131.05) 5 100

(2008) investigated association between short-term exposure to size-segregated particles and hospital admissions. they reported associations between total particle number concentrations and respiratory disease admissions. surface area concentrations also adversely associated with total respiratory ERV. a pollutant that exhibits a relatively strong association in a multipollutant model may be acting as a surrogate for an unmeasured or poorly measured pollutant. a pollutant that exhibits a relatively strong association in a multipollutant model may be attributable to an unmeasured or poorly measured pollutant. measurements from only one station were used for the particle size distribution data. we were not able to assess spatial variation in particle number concentrations. our measurement site may be considered as an urban background station. bias away from the null can occur in time-series studies of multiple pollutants. the air pollution mixture in Beijing is different from that of western cities."}
