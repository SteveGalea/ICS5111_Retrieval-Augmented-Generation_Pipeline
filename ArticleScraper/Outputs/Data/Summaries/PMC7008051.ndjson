{"summary": "in 2014, a genetically identical RSV outbreak occurred in the hemato-oncology ward of the university of the Ryukyus Hospital. a subset of RSV-infected patients underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak. the clinical information and chest X-ray findings were retrospectively reviewed from patient medical records within one week of the chest CT scan. eight RSV-infected patients underwent both chest X-ray and CT during the outbreak. the clinical information and chest X-ray findings were retrospectively reviewed from patient medical records within one week of the chest CT scan. ethics The medical records and radiological images of the collected cases were retrospectively reviewed. cytopenia, neutropenia 500/96/2/15 E. faecium High + + - - + - BWT 2 23 Acute myeloid leukemia Cytarabine Lymphocytopenia, neutropenia 0/0/0/31 negative High + + + - + - + - - Infiltrate GGOs along with bronchi (multi-lobar), BWT 3 78 ATLL Etoposide the most common finding among these patients was bronchial wall thickenings. two cases showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) along the bronchi. the other showed diffuse GGOs with centrilobular septal thickening. the first CT was performed one day after the supposed onset date. a diffuse crazy-paving pattern, centrilobular septal thickening, and ground-glass opacities were seen. twenty day later, these findings had become sparse. chest X-ray is appropriate for evaluating pulmonary overexpansion due to bronchiolitis in infants (17) bronchiolitis caused by RSV is relatively common in infants (18), it is not common in adults (11, 19) bronchiolitis caused by bronchiolitis was not observed in any of our eight cases. many reports have shown that nodules and tree-in-bud patterns are relatively common (5-8, 10) Kim et al. compared the CT findings among RSV, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. bronchial wall thickening was characteristic of RSV-LRTI compared to other respiratory viruses. ray failed to detect abnormalities in hematological malignancy patients. lower respiratory symptoms may predict the existence of CT abnormalities."}
