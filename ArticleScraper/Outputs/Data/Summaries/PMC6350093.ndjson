{"summary": "the period of measurement plays an important role in improving the performance of a time-series prediction. however, from the operational perspective in public health surveillance, there is a limitation to the length of the measurement period that can offer meaningful and valuable predictions. autocorrelation is often used to identify the best periodicity for time-series analysis [3-5]. this method selects the periodicity in which the autocorrelation is maximized. the periodicity is the interval that its prediction outperforms. for the prediction to be meaningful and valuable in public health surveillance, there has to be a limit to its length. shortest period of measurement that has an autocorrelation value similar to the maximum value of autocorrelations. data from surveillance systems are increasingly used to predict future trends in a wide range of noninfectious disease distributions. data have been used for further resource planning and initiating warning systems. ARIMA models are commonly used in public health surveillance [14]. they are built on three basic ideas: (1) the present value of time-series is a linear function of its past values and random noise in the AR model [22], (2) the present value of time-series is a linear function of its present and past values of residuals in the moving average model [23] and (3) the AR moving average model [24] considers both the AR and moving average models as well as historical values and residuals. public health surveillance uses ANN to forecast diseases distributions. Guan et al (2004) also used ANN to predict preplanting risk of hepatitis. autocorrelation may suggest a periodicity mapped to a period of measurement that is operationally too long to be meaningful. the current study aims to use CPA in order to identify the shortest period of measurement with an autocorrelation value similar to the maximum autocorrelation value. this period is too long to provide any value for practitioners. the 8-week period would cover most of the winter, which is expected to have more influenza A cases even if there is no prediction. a 1-week prediction window would be helpful to allow planning for potential changes, staffing or resource allocation. time-series prediction is a method often used in relevant literature [1,10-12], wherein the analysis predicts disease counts by modelling historical surveillance data [1,13]. but the literature in this area recommends the use of a wide range of methods such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [14] and structural equation modelling [15]. the ARIMA model generally fits the time-series data based on a previous AR moving average model [23], and (3) the AR moving average model [24] considers both the AR and moving average models as well as the historical values and residuals. the ARIMA models have been widely used for time-series prediction in public health surveillance [13,25], including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. data from surveillance systems are increasingly used to predict future trends in a wide range of noninfectious disease distributions. the ability to accurately forecast various diseases could facilitate key preparedness actions such as the development and use of medical countermeasures, communication strategies, and healthcare resource management. ARIMA models are commonly used in public health surveillance [14]. they are built on three basic ideas: 1) the present value of time-series is a linear function of its past values and random noise in the AR model [22], 2) the present value of time-series is a linear function of its present and past values of residuals in the moving average model [23], and (3) the AR moving average model [24] considers both the AR and moving average models. public health surveillance uses ANN to forecast diseases distributions. Guan et al (2004) also used ANN to predict incidents of hepatitis. the current study aims to use CPA in order to identify the shortest period of measurement with an autocorrelation value similar to the maximum autocorrelation value. this method is designed to detect subtle changes and characterize changing trends in a time-series [20,41] the autocorrelation for the shortest period of measurement occupies the first place and the autocorrelation for the longest period of measurement occupies the last place. the autocorrelation of the ACP is the autocorrelation for the shortest period of measurement with similar performance as the highest autocorrelations. this would result in similar performance between the period of measurement associated with the ACP and the highest autocorrelations. the data included cases for chlamydia, salmonella, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), gonorrhea, viral meningitis, and influenza A. for each disease, the dataset provides the number of reported cases in each epidemiological week. the parameters were model=multinomial log-linear models. maximum number of iterations=100, fitting=least squares, initial random weights=0.7, maximum allowable number of weights=1000, absolute stop fit criterion=1.0e-4, size of single hidden layers=11, and weight decay=0.1. the Q-score was defined as the quadratic errors of prediction under evaluation and the unskilled prediction presenting as a constant average. it takes Q\u2013score=1 if the time-series prediction under evaluation generates similar results as the unskilled prediction, producing a constant average. a change point is defined as the point that characterizes changing trends. the value for the change point is significantly different from the point value immediately before the change point. the PELT algorithm uses a common approach to detect change points. the ACP is the shortest period of measurement that has similar performance as the highest autocorrelations. if the immediate change point before the highest autocorrelation is descending, there is no available period of measurement that is shorter than the highest autocorrelations and has similar performance as the highest autocorrelations. training and testing sets were aggregated into groups of 1-8 weeks. the 1-week measurements are aggregated into groups of three. this aggregation starts from week 1. for each disease under the evaluation, we consider the prediction values of P(t)[0,) and the observation values of 0(t)[0,) with integer time 1t52 counting weeks within a year. the overall error of the prediction is quantified by the total squared discrepancy between the prediction values and observed values for the testing set. results show that the proposed method suggests a period of measurement of 3 weeks, which is operationally acceptable. the results show that the proposed method suggests a period of measurement of 3 weeks, which is operationally acceptable. results of CPs on Q-scores show that 3-week period of measurement generates similar performance as the best Q-scores for ANN and ARIMA. the best performance occurs in the 8-week period of measurement for both ANN and ARIMA. ural Networks and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. the proposed method for respiratory syncytial virus cases is measured by the Q-score. period of measurement (week) Q-score of the Artificial Neural Networks. the best performance measured by the Q-score for Artificial Neural Networks and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. the best performance measured by the Q-score occurs for the 3-week period of measurement; however, the 2-week period of measurement shows a DCP for the Q-scores of ANN. the biggest AC occurs in the 2-week period of measurement for both ANN and ARIMA. the best performance is in the 1-week period of measurement for both ANN and ARIMA when ACP occurs. the proposed method improves the prediction of influenza A. literature in statistics shows how the best period of measurement suggested by autocorrelation can improve the performance of a time-series prediction. however, long periods of measurement that likely provide better prediction performance may not be useful to practitioners because they are too long. this study proposed a method that runs CPA on autocorrelations and identifies the shortest period of measurement with a performance prediction similar to the best performance prediction. time-series prediction is an important tool for public health and clinical medicine to identify seasonal periods of changes in the relative risk for disease activity. observed values that exceed predicted parameters do not necessarily reflect a \u201cfailed\u201d prediction, but rather, a pattern of reported activity that was not observed in previous data. the period of measurement plays an important role in the performance of time-series analysis for disease counts. the literature has been using autocorrelation to identify the outperforming period of measurement. however, long periods may not provide sufficient values for public health and surveillance practitioners."}
