{"summary": "societal utility function includes measures of the total number of affected individuals, the spatial footprint of the infection, the costs of prophylaxis, vaccination and treatment, and the public perception of risk and comfort. routing strategies aimed at maximizing individual utility often lead to a loss of welfare for the social group as whole. the ratio of the total cost of the Nash equilibrium to the total cost of the social optimum is commonly referred to as the price of anarchy [10,11], indicating the inefficiency of decentralization [6,7], and the loss of social welfare due to the selfish behaviour of agents in the system. rerouting, elicited by individual awareness or imposed by public policy, on the dynamics of contagion through transportation networks. rerouting has a positive effect on the global outbreak, whereas for high traffic, it increases the number of affected nodes. the policy question we want to address is whether the authorities should act to enforce coordinated mobility strategies in the event of an outbreak. the disease propagates via individual exchanges between the nodes. awareness is adopted by non-aware nodes through topological diffusion. the mathematical epidemiology usually lies on the most simplistic compartmental models of susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIS) and susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS) a minimalistic SIS model allows for a more detailed analysis of the epidemic thresholds. we also show that our conclusions are relevant for diseases better described by the SIR model. we use a conceptual model of traffic-driven epidemics. a conceptual, simplified model In our model, the nodes can be in the different compartments of the infection model, and the infection spreads from node to node in the system through the exchange of individuals. the model is fermionic, in the sense that the state of the node is an aggregate variable representing the state of its population. network topology has attracted much attention [28,29,31,33]. the role of network topology on epidemic spreading has attracted much attention. infected individuals are banned from visiting healthy nodes. in the selfish case, we adopt the cost-function proposed in [17], Cj = Xj + hj, where Xj is either 1 if node j is infected, or +1 otherwise. in the selfish case, we propose the following cost-function: in the case of an SIR type of infection, in both strategies, individuals located at recovered nodes move through the shortest path to their destination. heterogeneous mean-field approach offers a clear framework to derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold in network models of contagion [29,31\u201333]. consider the evolution of the relative density of infected nodes, k(t), as well as the relative density of aware nodes, with degree k. invasion thresholds We assume that the awareness process is independent from the infection process, so the classical results for diffusive processes in networks apply [33] for an uncorrelated network, takes the form, and the invasion threshold is simply [33], where denotes averaging over all the nodes in the network. infected individuals adopt the policy travel along paths of infected nodes, vastly reducing the frequency of infectious contacts. probability reads 2.5 This form of leads to the invasion threshold 2.6 where denotes the second moment of the algorithmic betweenness. both awareness and disease spread through the system and reach endemic states. the mean-field assumption predicts that the invasion threshold changes in the presence of coordinated awareness in the system, but it remains unchanged in the case of selfish awareness. we use networks of size N = 5000 nodes, and average the results over 100 realizations. our HMF theory accurately predicts the different transitions observed in the numerical simulations, confirming the conceptual phase diagram depicted in figure 2. we use recovery rates, = aw = 1 and we set the degree of awareness = 0.8 for both the coordinated and selfish rerouting strategies. the results are averaged over 100 realizations. the results are averaged over 100 realizations. the degree of awareness is equal to = 0.8 and we use unit recovery rates. the substrate network is uncorrelated, scale-free with degree exponent equal to = 3.2 and of size N = 5000 nodes (subpopulations) the results are averaged over 50 realizations. the conceptual and metapopulation models seem to be equivalent in their predictions of the role of coordinated action on disease spreading. their quantitative match is remarkable, in particular the fact that, under the suggested rescaling, the invasion threshold derived for our conceptual model seems to capture the transition in the metapopulation model. data-driven simulations We apply our methodology to a more realistic scenario. the nodes in the network represent the 3141 counties in the contiguous US. the links between nodes represent daily commuting fluxes. we compute the price of anarchy for an infection starting at each one of the 2654 counties in the eastern part of the contiguous US. owing to traffic disorder, we observe strong spatial heterogeneity in the price of anarchy values, depending on the origin of the outbreak. we are interested in the mechanisms that allow for the spread of the disease in the first place rather than in the long-term equilibrium. from a long-term perspective, some diseases reach an equilibrium endemic state within the population, while others die out after an acute infection peak. the model captures the relevant features of mobility-driven disease spreading. the results are statistically equivalent to those obtained with a detailed metapopulation model. the model is fermionic, in the sense that the state of the node is an aggregate variable representing the state of its population. the larger the number of individuals a healthy node receives from infected nodes, the higher the probability for that node to become infected. we assume that individuals adopt the health state of the nodes they visit, regardless of their state at the origin or previous legs of their trip. in the selfish rerouting strategy, aware individuals favour routes that avoid infected nodes. a natural strategy to reach the social optimum is the segregation of travellers according to their health state. infected individuals are banned from visiting healthy nodes. in the coordinated strategy, individuals located at recovered nodes move through the shortest path to their destination. we define the degree of awareness of an aware node i, i(t) as the probability that an individual inside that node abandons the shortest path. we may replace nodal variables by degree-aggregates, and seek balance laws for the evolution of the density of nodes of a given degree. a node of degree k belongs to the healthy class, (1 k), and is infected with rate when it receives an individual from an infected node. the activation term for the awareness process quantifies the probability that non-aware nodes,, become aware via a neighbour node. the probability of this event is proportional to the adoption rate aw, the number of neighbours, k and the probability that a given link points to an infected node. in the case of selfish rerouting, the probability can be written as 2.3. the first term inside the brackets models the influence of individuals that travel from the non-aware nodes. the second term models the non-rerouting individuals that travel from aware nodes and the third one the rerouting individuals. a broad-based adoption of self-initiated rerouting is unable to increase the invasion threshold, implying that decreasing individual contagion risk may not decrease the societal risk. the diagram is divided in four regions: (N) The prevalence of the disease causes an endemic state, while awareness dies out exponentially fast. in this particular case, the invasion threshold (2.6) becomes 2.7. this prediction agrees nicely with our numerical simulations. the price of anarchy increases for more heterogeneous network substrates (smaller ). it is also higher for more aggressive diseases (larger aw) the infection rate is = 2.25, the awareness adoption rate has value aw = 0.25, and we set the traffic parameter to = 5. The degree of awareness is equal to = 0.8 and the recovery rates are equal to = 1/4 and aw = 1. The substrate network is uncorrelated, scale-free with degree exponent equal to = 3.2. /m is the recovery rate of the metapopulation model, p is the rate of individual travel, N is the total number of subpopulations in the system and is the average number of individuals per node. Equations (2.4) and (2.8) suggest that the conceptual and metapopulation models should be compared by considering the traffic-weighted infection rates and, respectively,. a priori prediction of the invasion threshold in the presence of policy-driven awareness in the metapopulation model. the substrate network is uncorrelated, scale-free with degree exponent equal to = 2 and of size N = 5000 nodes (subpopulations) the results are averaged over 50 realizations. we compute the price of anarchy for an infection starting at each one of the 2654 counties in the eastern part of the contiguous US. based on traffic disorder, we observe strong spatial heterogeneity in the price of anarchy values. the price of anarchy reveals the essential differences between selfish and coordinated strategies in terms of their impact on the spreading of the epidemics. the price of anarchy in the eastern part of the united states is related to the nature of the disease, the topology of the network substrate and the resources deployed to enforce adoption of coordinated action. a number of N individuals are initially placed in the system randomly and uniformly. individuals move through the shortest paths to randomly chosen destinations with velocity of one node-to-node jump per time step. an infected node becomes healthy with a recovery rate. an aware subpopulation forgets about the information with rate aw, which we set equal to 1. On the other hand, a non-aware node adopts the information with probability, and kaw is the number of aware neighbours. when the system reaches equilibrium, we compute the density of infected nodes. an individual inside an aware node with probability reroutes from the shortest path to the destination and moves according to the policy-driven strategy. when the system reaches equilibrium, we compute the density of infected nodes, assuming that a node i is infected if Ii/Vi > 1%. the average number of infected individuals at equilibrium in a subpopulation k of population Vk is Vk, where is a disease-dependent parameter equal to = (R0 1)/R0 [43]. Those individuals can trigger the start of the epidemic in a susceptible subpopulation i with probability. the second term on the right-hand side is the probability that the subpopulation is not already seeded by infected individuals. the files provide data at the county level for residents of the 50 states and the district of Columbia (DC). the data contain information on 34 000 commuters in N = 3141 counties. in the SIS model, a node can be either susceptible to the disease or infected. an infected node becomes healthy with a recovery rate. a non-aware node adopts the information with probability. in each node i, an SIS dynamics takes place over a well-mixed population Vi(t) an aware subpopulation forgets about the information with rate aw. a non-aware node j adopts the information with probability. a metapopulation network of size N and degree distribution P(k) sets the population size proportional to the topological betweenness. we assume the mobility process in which each individual in a node i, with a probability p, travels to a destination node j that is randomly selected with probability proportional to its size Vj. the first term on the right-hand side is the probability that the subpopulation is not already seeded by infected individuals. the last term is the probability that the new seeded population will experience an outbreak. the above self-consistent equation defines the global invasion threshold in equation (2.8) after this initial training period, we assign 'home counties' to individuals. we add the additional mobility rule of recurrent patterns. we then infect the county of consideration."}
