{"summary": "the CDC developed guidelines that identify the essential elements and attributes for an effective public health surveillance system. evaluating surveillance systems involves 2 main steps: 1) describing the purpose, operation, and elements of the system and 2) assessing its performance according to key attributes. a state party must notify WHO of \"all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern\" IHR 2005 defines disease as an illness or medical condition that does or could threaten human health regardless of its source or origin. this scope therefore encompasses communicable and noncommunicable disease events. IHR 2005 contains a \"decision instrument\" that helps state parties identify whether a health-related event may constitute a PHEIC and therefore requires formal notification to WHO. IHR 2005's surveillance strategy is specifically designed to make IHR 2005 directly applicable to emerging infectious disease events. state parties are also specifically required to inform WHO within 48 hours of implementing additional health measures that interfere with international trade and travel. mandate that WHO establish IHR contact points that are always accessible to state parties. the focal point is designed to facilitate rapid sharing of surveillance information. state parties will be primarily responsible for providing resources needed to develop their core surveillance capacities. IHR 2005 defines a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC) as an event determined by the WHO Director-General. IHR 2005 defines disease as an illness or medical condition that does or could threaten human health regardless of its source or origin. IHR 2005 includes a list of diseases for which a single case may constitute a PHEIC. IHR 2005's expansion of the range of public health events under surveillance is possibly the single most important surveillance advance in IHR 2005. this change greatly enhances effective surveillance of emerging infectious diseases. state parties are also specifically required to inform WHO within 48 hours of implementing additional health measures that interfere with international trade. each state party has to develop and maintain capabilities to detect, assess, and report disease events at the local, intermediate, and national level. officials must be able to report through the national IHR focal point to WHO when required under IHR 2005. usefulness, sensitivity, timeliness, stability, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, data quality, positive predictive value, and representativeness will be most critical to the success of the IHR 2005 surveillance system. sensitivity, timeliness, stability, simplicity, flexibility, data quality, data quality, positive predictive value, and representativeness will affect the establishment and sustainability of the surveillance system. surveillance is streamlined and transparent, especially at international level Flexibility Ability to adapt to changing information needs and operating conditions Acceptability Willingness of persons and organizations to participate Establishment of surveillance in international law represents commitment by state parties to participate Data quality Completeness and validity of recorded data. investigators in the united kingdom applied the then-proposed decision instrument to all events (N = 30) that were important enough to have been published in the national surveillance bulletin for England and Wales during 2003 (11) the decision instrument was highly sensitive for selecting outbreaks and incidents that require reporting under the proposed IHR revision. the sensitivity of the IHR 2005 surveillance system will probably be affected by 2 factors. timeliness may be the most important attribute that IHR 2005 will have to demonstrate to be effective. state parties must notify WHO within 24 hours of assessing any event that may constitute a PHEIC or that is unexpected or unusual. state parties must also respond within 24 hours to all requests that WHO makes for verification of health-related events in their territories. state parties can obtain a 2-year extension on this deadline by submitting a justified need and an implementation plan. the 5-year grace period and the possibility of 2-year extensions was a necessary compromise. stability and reliability of the surveillance system are designed to increase steadily as the grace period and any extensions come to an end. the decision instrument was highly sensitive for selecting outbreaks and incidents that require reporting under the proposed IHR revision. the sensitivity of the IHR 2005 surveillance system will probably be affected by 2 factors. in all likelihood, inadequate capacities at the local and intermediate levels will limit the system's sensitivity more than capacities at the national level. timeliness may be the most important attribute that IHR 2005 will have to demonstrate to be effective. state parties must notify WHO within 24 hours of assessing any event that may constitute a PHEIC or that is unexpected or unusual. the same 24-hour requirement applies to reporting public health risk outside a state party's territory that may constitute a PHEIC. the 5-year grace period, and the possibility of 2-year extensions, was a necessary compromise. the stability and reliability of the IHR 2005 surveillance system are designed to increase steadily as the grace period and any extensions come to an end. the sensitivity of surveillance systems for new pathogens has historically been limited, especially if such pathogens presented themselves in unusual or unexpected ways. syndromic surveillance has not been effective in detecting emerging infectious diseases early (21) only a few states have assessed their ability to detect and respond to emerging disease threats. the IHR 2005 requirement that each state party assess the condition of its public health surveillance within 2 years of the regulations' entry into force should help countries improve their national governance for surveillance purposes. many states will need external assistance with such work. technical issues Emerging infectious diseases often create technical challenges for surveillance. sensitivity of surveillance systems for new pathogens has historically been limited. syndromic surveillance has not been effective in detecting emerging infectious diseases early (21) only a few states have assessed their ability to detect and respond to emerging disease threats. the IHR 2005 requirement that each state party assess the condition of its public health surveillance within 2 years of the regulations' entry into force should help countries improve their national governance for surveillance purposes. IHR 2005 includes provisions that require WHO to recommend, and state parties to use, control measures that are no more restrictive than necessary to achieve the desired level of health protection. IHR 2005 prescribes essential elements of a surveillance system and seeks to achieve critical attributes of usefulness, sensitivity, timeliness, and stability."}
