{"summary": "three agencies collected samples from bats in regions where MERS cases had been identified. the agencies are the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, the Center for Infection and Immunity of Columbia University, and EcoHealth Alliance. the team interviewed the family of an index case-patient in Bisha. wing punch biopsy samples were collected for speciation by DNA analysis. all samples were stored in liquid nitrogen and transported to Riyadh. the shipment was inadvertently opened at customs in the united states. at arrival, all samples had thawed.
