{"summary": "two major emergency disease-control measures were cremation of bodies and enforcement of quarantine for asymptomatic individuals suspected of being in contact with a positive case. in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended. local communities show a will to be engaged and a high degree of flexibility in participating to the epidemic response. Efforts in the direction of awareness and community involvement could prove to be better strategy to control the epidemic. by the end of May 2015, the epidemic resulted in 11,162 deaths, on 27,781 cases globally declared [1] study was conducted to assess liberian community perspectives on state-imposed Ebola public health and outbreak containment measures implemented in 2014 and 2015. the research took place in Montserrado (Greater Monrovia and St. Paul Bridge districts) and Grand Cape Mount counties. the research dealt with both types of leaders, with an emphasis on those who were based locally. other forms of administration of power and socio-political legitimacy included the \u201csecret societies\u201d of which Poro and Sande are the most important. Narratives were collected through 45 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) for a total of 432 participants and 30 semi-structured individual interviews. questionnaire grids with starter questions were provided to the moderator of FGDs and interviewers, in order to frame the discussion. data analysis was carried out through triangulation of methodological tools (observation / FGD / interview); time (e.g. during quarantine / after quarantine); space (different neighbourhood or villages); persons (e.g. leader / common person); area and general social environment where the interviewed acted. research took place in Montserrado (Greater Monrovia and St. Paul Bridge Districts) and Grand Cape Mount (Tewor and Commonwealth Districts) counties. the areas were purposively selected, on the basis of different criteria: epidemiological incidence of Ebola (cases per neighbourhood or village); presence of quarantined houses. both political (government and traditional) and religious (Christian, Muslim, and traditional) leaders were involved as participants. representatives of the two main secret societies in liberia were involved as informants on the practices of their societies. each grid contained basic questions but was open to probes and contextual questions. social status, religious belonging, degree of involvement in the epidemic (e.g. family link with the sick or dead) were considered as patterns of discussion. data analysis was carried out through assessment of transcriptions, with key-words and key-concept comparison. data analysis was carried out through assessment of transcriptions, with key-words and key-concept comparison. participants observation was organized without a full involvement of the researchers in the social practices. state-enforced quarantine has been enforced in several areas of monrovia and villages in rural counties. study participants explained how food, water and other items were only intermittently distributed by the implementing agencies, creating harm and forcing residents to disobey imposed isolation. quarantine triggered a process of publicly labelling those under forced isolation. a local religious leader remarked bitterly how the quarantine brought suspicion and mistrust to his community. the common labelling was \u201cebola people\u201d, despite the fact that they were not even infectious. the state-enforced quarantine was imposed vertically, and overshadowed local isolation measures. local leaders organized the limitation of movements in the communities for contacts, inviting them to be reachable, or for foreigners to be identifiable as soon they arrived in the neighbourhood. a significant decrease in unsafe handling of funerals was registered and recognized by all respondents. participants criticized the way it was implemented and the duration of enforcement, continuing cremation even after the number of fatalities decreased. the mandatory cremation and disorganized body collection created an informal economy of dead bodies, uncontrolled by health authorities and international NGOs. demand for proper funerals resulted in burials organized by non-official teams that took care of the removal of the body, finding a graveyard and burying the body. some participants claimed that bribery and corruption was normal, and rich families could pay the official burial team to \u201cclose an eye\u201d and let them contact a Funeral Home. families calling the national hotline of the Ebola Task Force to activate the burial teams for picking up a body and not receiving any answer. families waiting for burial teams for hours or even days, with dead bodies in the streets or indoors. several cases of non-Ebola deceased sent to cremation because of fear. outbreak response managed by state-related actors created a climate of fear. fear and insecurity continued to shape people's perceptions. outbreak described as exploiting social bonds and creating mutual distrust. in august 2014 the government of liberia commanded the quarantine of an entire neighbourhood in monrovia, considered a slum. many people were injured, and one person died during the clashes. state-enforced quarantine has been enforced in several areas of monrovia and villages. state-enforced quarantine broke social networks of solidarity and was implemented with lots of gaps that raised social concern. study participants explained how food, water and other items were only intermittently distributed by the implementing agencies, creating harm and forcing residents to disobey the imposed isolation. a young man conferred the reason of forced isolation of his neighbours on their belonging to the \"Fula\" tribe. despite being perfectly integrated and actually liberian citizens, a subtle popular belief holds that Fula are nomads and therefore foreigners. two houses with a total of 52 individuals, contacts of two positive cases, were requested to be available for contact tracing. no restriction of movement was imposed, since contacts agreed to be available daily. machinist: \"we don't ban movements, they are free to go and get food...how they can do otherwise\" cremation of bodies was another measure taken to curtail transmission. participants criticized the way it was implemented and the duration of enforcement. a significant decrease in unsafe handling of funerals was registered and recognized by all respondents. some participants claimed that bribery and corruption was normal. some said that rich families could pay the official burial team to \u201cclose an eye\u201d and let them contact a Funeral Home. these dynamics and social behaviours have been labelled by the media as \u201csecret burials\u201d. a quote from a fGD held in Paynesville, monrovia, exemplifies the communities' feeling around the situations listed: \"when I saw that body on the road I felt very bad. it stayed there for hours under the sun! and nobody came to pick up...we called, called, called. and then-i tell you!\u2013I understand those that keep the body in, which is unsafe, but at least they can do a proper funeral and cry for it\" the outbreak was described as exploiting social bonds and creating mutual distrust. it revived the time of civil war with its climate of insecurity and suspicion towards neighbours, close acquaintances and foreigners. anthropological perspective allowed an understanding of socio-political implications of public health measures. the social response of liberians to state-enforced, vertical, quarantine demonstrated a thin boundary between collective responsibility and respect of individual rights and civil liberties. the argument of interrupting transmission through vertical measures was not balanced by a guarantee of basics for living, social protection and individual freedom. a top-down militarized-like measure does not allow the population to understand the emergency situation. a top-down militarized-like measure does not allow the population to understand the emergency situation. a top-down militarized-like measure does not allow the population to understand the emergency situation, creating a distance between institutions and citizens. research supports a comprehensive approach to outbreak control. health is considered in its totality of shades, from the biomedical to the social."}
