{"summary": "EBOV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA () virus known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) the virus was responsible for >11,000 cases and >28,000 deaths. at the conclusion of this outbreak in 2016, EBOV once again faded from the public spotlight. viral reservoirs within immune-privileged sites have implications for reemergence and persistence of the virus within the infected individual. these reservoirs may allow for the transmission of the virus to additional individuals long after initial infection, hindering efforts to control spread of outbreaks. spread of the virus by this route is of particular concern. several cases of sexual transmission from male to female have already been documented. one of the first cases involved transmission from a man 6 months past his recovery to a woman in liberia. EVs are heterogeneous; as such, the current literature separates EVs into several different categories based on differences in size and cellular origin. microvesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane and are generally larger than exosomes with diameters ranging from 100 to 1000 nm. exosomes are formed from the invagination of the endosomal membrane, leading to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within the endo classical formation of ILVs and exosomes has been characterized to take place via ESCRT-mediated packaging. ESCRT-independent routes include CD63-mediated interactions [54,55] and by means of lipids such as neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase; ceramide-dependent exosome formation) the heterogeneity of EVs has forced the development of several purification techniques geared towards the isolation of distinct EV populations. the traditional gold standard of EV isolation involves a series of stepwise ultracentrifugation steps to sediment total EV populations, followed by density gradient separation (iodixanol or sucrose) to further divide EVs into distinct density fractions. the methods required for virion removal are largely dictated by the overall size of the virion in question. for example, the Ebola virion measures approximately 1\u20132 m in diameter, allowing for the vast majority of it to be removed from the supernatant using 1\u20132 passes through a 0.22 m filter [91,92,93,94,95,96]. expected results for iodixanol fractions in increments of 1.2% from 6.0%\u201318.0%. fractions where either virions or VLPs are known to elute or sediment are indicated by red boxes. EBOV proteins such as VP40, GP and NP are packaged into EVs released from EBOV-infected cells. EBOV more recently gained notoriety during the largest outbreak to date in west africa. the virus was responsible for >11,000 cases and >28,000 deaths. at the conclusion of this outbreak in 2016, EBOV faded from the public spotlight. viral reservoirs within immune-privileged sites have implications for reemergence and persistence of the virus within the infected individual. this type of \u201cclinical latency\u201d or persistent infection has significance for public health in ways: (1) viral reservoirs within immune privileged sites have implications for reemergence and persistence of the virus within the infected individual. one of the first such cases involved transmission from a man 6 months past his recovery to a woman in liberia [30,31] to date, three additional \u201cflare-ups\u201d of EBOV by sexual contact have been determined, together accounting for approximately half of the eight mini-outbreaks caused by persistently infected survivors documented since 2016 [32,33,34,35]. EVs are heterogeneous; as such, the current literature separates EVs into several different categories based on differences in size and cellular origin. microvesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane and are generally larger than exosomes with diameters ranging from 100 to 1000 nm. exosomes are formed from the invagination of the endosomal membrane, leading to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within the endo ESCRT-independent mechanisms of exosomal biogenesis have been demonstrated. this was initially observed through the generation of ILVs in cell lines. these proposed ESCRT-independent routes include CD63-mediated interactions [54,55] the heterogeneity of EVs has forced the development of several purification techniques geared towards the isolation of distinct EV populations. the traditional gold standard of EV isolation involves stepwise ultracentrifugation steps to sediment total EV populations, followed by density gradient separation (i.e., iodixanol or sucrose) to further divide EVs into distinct density fractions. the HIV virion measures 1\u20132 m in diameter, allowing for the vast majority of it to be removed from the supernatant using a 0.22 m filter. on the other hand, the HIV virion measures only 100 nm in diameter, a size similar to that of exosomes, thereby requiring exclusion through density gradient separation. profiles of mature human immunodeficiency virus virions (as indicated by p24 capsid protein) vs. exosomal marker proteins when cell culture supernatants are separated by density, such as by iodixanol or sucrose gradients. fractions where either virions or VLPs are known to elute or sediment are indicated by red boxes. EBOV proteins such as VP40, GP and NP are packaged into EV studies have shown additional non-structural functions of VP40 that may play potentially important roles in EBOV pathogenesis. interactions of VP40 with host proteins and pathways have been shown to impact the host cell in a variety of ways. this is very similar to the actions of TSG101 with matrix or associated proteins of other viruses. the EBOV VP40 YPx(n)L/I late domain motif has been confirmed to recruit Alix to aid in viral budding and egress independently of TSG101. the vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4) protein (responsible for the final stage of ILV formation and various membrane scission events such as cytokinesis) has been previously implicated to play a role in the budding of EBOV VLPs. VP40 may serve as a natural target for integration into exosomes by the ESCRT pathway. if VP40 requires ubiquitination to become packaged into exosomes, it may be interesting to determine if ISG15 or ubiquitin ligase inhibitors are able to prevent the packaging of VP40 into exosomes. cyclin D1 levels have been linked in many cases to oncogenic phenotypes and accelerated cell cycling. attention was focused on cyclin D1 as the D family of cyclins are the first to be upregulated during the initiation of cell cycle. previous studies have shown EBOV VP40 present in infected cells transiently at early stages of infection. nuclear VP40 protein was indeed present in the nucleus at fairly high levels. ESCRT pathway\u2019s role in the release of VP40 exosomes was shown to be mediated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. most EVs were produced from all cell types during G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. this suggests that progression through cell cycle may enhance exosome and EV generation by the same mechanism. VP40-containing EVs have been proposed as an additional possible mechanism for the induction of bystander lymphocyte apoptosis during EVD. EVs containing VP40 from infected cells may travel to recipient immune cells. this could reduce pool of surveilling T-cells and monocytes, allowing the virus to replicate unhindered. if this mechanism of immune modulation prove true, it may be even more relevant in cases of persistent infections. the EBOV VP40 YPx(n)L/I late domain motif has been confirmed to recruit Alix to aid in viral budding and egress independently of TSG101. the vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4) protein (responsible for the final stage of ILV formation and various membrane scission events such as cytokinesis) has been previously implicated in the budding of EBOV VLPs. interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15; a ubiquitin-like protein known mainly for its role in ISGylation) has been shown to inhibit the NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination of VP40. additional E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been shown to interact with VP40 include itchy E3 ubiquitin ligase (ITCH) [112], WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligas cyclin D1 levels have been linked in many cases to oncogenic phenotypes. upregulation of cyclin D1 as seen in VP40-producing cells is expected to result in increased growth. cyclin D1 levels have been linked to oncogenic phenotypes. attention was focused on cyclin D1 as the D family of cyclins are the first to be upregulated during the initiation of cell cycle from G0. the fact that cyclin D1 is upregulated in cells producing VP40 led to a new set of questions regarding the mechanism of upregulation. previous studies have shown cyclin D1 present within the nucleus of infected cells transiently at early stages of infection. VP40-containing EVs have been proposed as an additional possible mechanism for the induction of bystander lymphocyte apoptosis during EVD. this was evidenced by the induction of cell death of both T-cells and monocytes upon incubation with VP40 EVs. this was evidenced by the induction of cell death of both T-cells and monocytes upon incubation. 293T cells had improved viability when treated with VP40 EVs. this contrast has interesting implications for how EVs from infected cells may impact pathogenesis within individuals. if this mechanism of immune modulation prove true, it may be even more relevant in cases of recurrent or persistent infections. EBOV NP encapsidates it with strong affinity which is regulated by a system of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation. each NP monomer covers a six-base RNA fragment and holds the genome in an ordered, left-handed helical shape. the NP C-terminus is poorly conserved and shares no homology with other viruses of the same order. EBOV NP lacking amino acids 451\u2013600 or 506\u2013739 failed to form properly-sized nucleocapsids. lysine residues in EBOV NP were recently described to be acetylated by recombinant histone acetyltransferases in vitro. acetylated lysine residues in EBOV NP may be docking sites for other host proteins. many bromodomain-containing proteins have chromatin remodeling and/or transcription modification functions. one such protein, Brd3, has a critical function in the elicitation of type I IFN production [149] mouse-adapted EBOV has mutations in NP and VP24 that render the virus lethal in wild type mice. a recombinant virus bearing only the NP mutation, denoted \u201cWT-NPMA,\u201d found in mouse-adapted EBOV, demonstrates resistance to type I IFN when grown in murine macrophages treated with type I IFN. EBOV NP in EVs may be an early immunosuppressive strike that predisposes the infected host to develop a fulminant infection. if present, the role of any RNAs bound by EV-associated NP have yet to be elucidated. however, this affinity of RNA by NP has been shown to not be specific for viral RNA only. the GP1 subunit, also known as the core protein, interacts with GP2 and forms the head of the protein that interacts with receptors. only 20%\u201325% of GP products are the membrane-anchored GP1,2 form. a shed form of GP1,2 (shed GP) is generated by a cleavage event at the cell membrane by host tumor necrosis factor-a converting enzyme (TACE) a micropinocytosis-like mechanism is characterized by actin-dependent plasma membrane ruffling and blebbing to engulf bulk cargo and extracellular fluid. the virus is then trafficked to late endosomes and/or lysosomes, as indicated by co-localization first with Rab5-positive early endosomes and then Rab7/LAMP-1-positive late endosomes. vesicles from the Golgi do not necessarily target only to the cell surface. alternative targets include early and late endosomes, MVBs, and lysosomes. vesicles from the Golgi are known to contain fully formed GP1,2. three proposed mechanisms of packaging of EBOV proteins VP40, GP, and NP into EVs are illustrated along with hypothesized times of release. entry of infectious virions or VLPs into host cells through endosomes results in cleavage of the outer portions of GP1,2, binding to the host receptor. resulting hypothesized exosomes would be released approximately 24\u201330+ h post-infection (after viral translation of new protein components) a recent study showed shed GP-treated monocytes were triggered into differentiation through TLR4 activation [170]. shed GP-treated monocytes were triggered into differentiation through TLR4 activation [167,168,169] shed GP in myeloid cells can boost vascular permeability of endothelial cells. it also promotes cytokine release to recruit additional immune targets for the virus. if GP proves to be exposed on the surface of EVs, it is possible that similar mechanisms could be at work. additional cargo may be packaged within EVs as a result of these viral proteins. it has not yet been determined whether EBOV packages any of its four other proteins into EVs. VP30 and L are important for the translation of viral products. IL-15 induces proliferation and differentiation of B-cells, T-cells and NK cells. both IL-15 and MCP-1 have been found to be hyper-secreted in fatal EVD. the functional role of this cytokine in EV pathogenesis is not known. a recent study by Fitzgerald et al. characterized the presence of 33 cytokines on the surface vs. encapsulated within EVs vs. secreted as soluble forms from in vitro (T-cells and monocytes), ex vivo (tissue explants from amniotic, placenta, tonsillar and cervical origins) their results suggested that various cytokines could be released either as soluble or EV-associated forms first experiments have focused on the role of exosomes due to the more developed literature on characteristics and biogenesis of these vesicles. however, other important types of vesicles such as microvesicles may be equally or of greater importance to the pathogenesis and unconventional secretion of EBOV components. final biogenesis of exosomes by this model will result in exosomes that have GP1,2 on the outside, and VP40 and RNA-bound NP on the inside. sGP may also be released in a free form. we hypothesize that these microvesicles will vary widely in diameter. viral components may be packaged into and released from infected cells in various EVs at time points earlier than the release of virions. if EVs containing GP are released before virion release, they may be able to either wipe out sentinel immune cells that are susceptible, or accelerate cell cycling of recipient epithelial cells to act as future sites of infection. persistent EBOV infection and replication along with systemic inflammation was found in monocyte/macrophage (CD68+) cells in multiple compartments including in vitreous human and adjacent tissue, the epididymis, and the brain [197]. if retinal pigment epithelial cells are able to sustain EBOV infection, perhaps through VP40 upregulation of cell cycle or other transcriptional events that downregulate cell death, these cells could release a variety of EVs containing multiple EBOV proteins could be responsible for the killing of bystander T-cells and the priming and recruitment of myeloid cells for subsequent infection. infected cells may release low, consistent levels of EBOV protein-associated EVs, which can then travel to peripheral areas and simultaneously destroy surveilling immune populations. both of these possibilities would represent novel mechanisms which could allow for the virus to effectively evade host immune responses to infection."}
