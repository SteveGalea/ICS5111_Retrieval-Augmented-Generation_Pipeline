{"summary": "customs officers are considered as 'high-demand' and 'high-responsibility' governmental officials. their careers are characterized with professionalism and involve multiple tasks. they are also involved in detecting and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country. the purpose of this review was to investigate data on customs officers published in PubMed over the past 30 years. we identified studies evaluating customs officers in relation to infectious diseases and occupational health risk. the purpose of this review was to categorize these studies as shown in Table I. customs officers played a significant role in the international public health control measures implemented to limit the spread of pandemic A/H1N1 influenza. measures included containment triage of febrile patients at front-line healthcare settings, mandatory quarantine orders for close contacts, temperature screening at border entry points and mitigation strategies. varicella and herpes zoster virus is the cause of varicella and herpes zoster. the virus continues to plague children and adults worldwide. the outbreaks have been associated with the low protection levels against VSV in migrants and refugees coming to Europe. a number of countries have instituted border measures as a means of inhibiting or attenuating its international spread. these measures consisted of a combination of border entry screening programs to detect arriving travelers with symptoms of SARS, quarantine, isolation and communications. the contribution of customs officers during these border control measures was significant. an analytical computational simulation of economic modelling showed that when implementing a pandemic influenza vaccination program, influenza vaccination was not cost-saving in any of the studied influenza scenarios (15) when the participation rate reached 100%, the program was cost-saving, when the influenza attack rate was 30% and the symptomatic rate 65%. however, in 1987, a cross-sectional study by Bandaranayake et al failed to demonstrate any significant association between customs officers' occupational variables and the prevalence of hepatitis B a detainee at a US ICE in california was diagnosed with measles in may 2016. a second case of measles in a staff member was confirmed by quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 31 total cases of measles in 22 detainees and nine staff members were identified. the 11,500-member union petitioned the customs and Revenue Agency to meet a list of demands regarding SARS. customs officers played a significant role in the international public health control measures implemented to limit the spread of pandemic A/H1N1 influenza. varicella and herpes zoster virus is the cause of varicella and herpes zoster, which continues to plague children and adults worldwide. the virus is the cause of varicella and herpes zoster, which continues to plague children and adults worldwide. 31 total cases of measles in 22 detainees and nine staff members were identified. this finding highlights the necessity for primary reliance on supplementary immunization activities to assure two doses of measles-containing vaccine. psittaki is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the obligatory intracellular bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. bacterium can infect parrots, parakeets, canaries and other avian species. illegal bird trade can be a possible source of zoonotic infections. the risk of contracting psittacosis was 2.8-fold higher in officers exposed for >2 h to parakeets than for those briefly exposed. this outbreak emphasized the need for the preventive measures in customs service for the customs officers handling suspicious import or export goods. customs officers to diesel engine emission (DEE) recruited 194 non-smoking officers. 136 were solely occupied with clearing of diesel trucks. dee concentrations varied between 31 and 60 g/m3 and benzo[a]pyrene concentrations were between 10 and 15 ng/m3. both cases were diagnosed as a specific form of organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) it was hypothesized that the symptoms were evoked most probably by the non-specific action of low molecular fungal metabolites, such as mycotoxins or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with the possible contribution of bacterial endotoxin. further studies are required to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of the disorders associated with the exposure to stored tobacco. officers working 46-h shifts reported a high proportion of sleep difficulties and digestive disturbances. the situation was similar to that of officers working 212-h shifts and day workers. the conflictual relations with travelers had the largest and most marked influence on the area of sleep and digestive and cardiovascular problems. study recruited 194 non-smoking customs officers, from which brush nasal cytology probes were taken twice a year over a period of 5 years. 136 were solely occupied with the clearing of diesel trucks, where measured DEE concentrations varied between 31 and 60 g/m3 and benzo[a]pyrene concentrations were between 10 and 15 ng/m3. the findings may indicate a genotoxic effect of chronic DEE exposure in humans. both cases were diagnosed as a specific form of organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) it was hypothesized that the symptoms were evoked most probably by the non-specific action of low molecular fungal metabolites, such as mycotoxins or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with the possible contribution of bacterial endotoxin. further studies are required to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of the disorders associated with the exposure to stored tobacco. officers working 46-h shifts reported a high proportion of sleep difficulties and digestive disturbances. their situation was very similar to that of officers working 38-h shifts. the conflictual relations with travelers had the largest and most marked influence on the area of sleep and digestive and cardiovascular problems. study recruited 194 non-smoking customs officers, from which brush nasal cytology probes were taken twice a year over a period

both cases were diagnosed as a specific form of organic dust toxic syndrome. it was hypothesized that the symptoms were evoked most probably by the non-specific action of low molecular fungal metabolites, such as mycotoxins or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with the possible contribution of bacterial endotoxin. study by Prunier et al (37) performed in Paris, France, compared the effects of different shift schedules used by French Customs Units. the officers working 46-h shifts reported a high proportion of sleep difficulties and digestive disturbances. the situation was very similar to that of officers working 38-h shifts and contrasted markedly with that of officers working 212-h shifts and day workers. MM and DAS contributed equally to the conception and design of the study. both authors have read and approved the final manuscript."}
