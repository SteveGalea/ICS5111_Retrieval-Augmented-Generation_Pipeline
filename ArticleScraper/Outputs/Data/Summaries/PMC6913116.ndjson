{"summary": "goal was to increase efficiency of disease reporting by an electronic data capture website to allow faster data collection, analysis, and reporting. second goal was to collect information on additional types of illness (eg, fever, upper respiratory infections, rashes, lice) web-based, password-protected biosurveillance program designed specifically for preschool/childcare centers was created in collaboration with university information technology services. no parent, childcare provider, or child-identifying data were collected as part of surveillance program. definitions of influenza and gastroenteritis were exactly the same as those required by the county public health department on the paper-based reporting forms. a child unable to participate in normal activities or requiring excessive attention should be excluded from child care. free-text options were also included in the design to allow the childcare provider to add any additional comments. providers were trained to report on any ill children who required immediate exclusion, those who needed isolation and observation in the center, or sick children who were reported absent by parents by phone. each report was expected to take the provider 30 seconds or less to complete. each report was expected to take the provider 30 seconds or less to complete. all 4 centers cared for children year-round, were state licensed, and were accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) none of the participating centers cared for acutely ill children or special-needs children exclusively. sickchildcare.org collected more detailed, de-identified, confidential primary data. the center director reported daily center census with every entry. age of the ill child was recorded as infant (0-12 months), toddler (13-35 months), or preschooler (36-59 months). the public health department was contacted; (5) the child was allowed to remain at the center for the rest of the day; (7) the child was placed in isolation and observed; or (8) parent action unknown. the website included language approved by the local health department asking childcare providers to call the local or state health department immediately if specific reportable illnesses were suspected or confirmed. such illnesses included measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis, hepatitis A or B, tuberculos all 4 centers switched to online reporting only. only 2 of the centers preferred not to participate. the additional 2 centers preferred not to participate. an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness was detected among centers during the winter 2013-14 season approximately 3 weeks ahead of the outbreak reported by the county public health department. influenzalike illness cases reported through sickchildcare.org showed similar trends in comparison to county public health\u2013based reporting for schools and preschools. countries outside the united states have recently been conducting routine biosurveillance in childcare centers. the Netherlands is reporting the first national childcare center\u2013based biosurveillance network. sickchildcare.org was widely accessible because it is online and compatible with mobile phone devices. the program provided potentially new data to determine if parents were using medical resources for sick children in child care. all childcare centers chose to remain with the web-based biosurveillance system. data was collected from childcare centers that were operating from within a single county. the disparity of the illness burden of center 2 compared to the other centers was explained by a more severe outbreak of gastroenteritis, with a higher number of individual cases reported. an estimate of yearly cost-savings at the public health level was calculated to be about $780, given savings of about 0.5 hour per week at a compensated rate of $30 per hour. more widespread adoption of an electronic reporting system such as ours could have increasingly meaningful effects for cost saving across other counties. state childcare policy is to internally document any child who is absent due to illness or is sent home due to illness. the actual number of cases using Sickchildcare.org increased compared to illness reports using the paper-based system. this could lead to possible incorrect categorization of illness. access to real-time information would allow centers to be better prepared to increase staff during anticipated times of illness, promote more thorough cleaning protocols, and disseminate timely family and worker influenza immunization reminders. future goals of our biosurveillance reporting system would be to provide active surveillance using laboratory-confirmed testing of ill children for different pathogens."}
