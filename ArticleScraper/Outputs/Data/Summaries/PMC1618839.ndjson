{"summary": "atypical pneumonia is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), a small, gram-negative obligate intravenous zoosis. the ewe that had lambed tested positive for C. burnetii antibodies. high concentrations of C. burnetii can be found in birth products of infected mammals[2]. humans often acquire infection through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from parturient fluids, placenta or wool[1]. Approximately 5% of cases are hospitalized, and fatal cases are rare[1]. between 1991 and 2000 the annual number of cases varied from 46 to 273 cases per year. in 2001 and 2002, 293 and 191 cases were notified, respectively[11,12]. etiology was unclear, pathogens were considered. a chronic infection was confirmed when both anti-phase I IgG and anti-phase II IgG antibody titers were raised. a chronic infection was confirmed when both anti-phase I IgG and anti-phase II IgG antibody titers were raised. a case in this context was defined as any person with a clinical diagnosis compatible with Q fever. local health departments also reported whether a notified case was hospitalized. telephone interviews were performed using standardized questionnaires. a case was defined as a person with onset of fever between May 4 and June 3, 2003 and at least three of the following symptoms: headache, cough, dyspnea, joint pain, muscle pain, weight loss of more than 2 kg, fatigue, nausea or vomiting. the overall attack rate among adults was estimated based on the clinical case definition. the number of children visiting the farmers' market was the same as that of adults. the true number of children with Q fever was estimated by the number of reported children divided by the estimated proportion reported. sensitivity analysis was performed with Epi Info, version 6.04 (CDC, Atlanta, USA) samples of 25 sheep from five other flocks in the Soest area were also tested for C. burnetii. a chronic infection was confirmed when both anti-phase I IgG and anti-phase II IgG antibody titers were raised. internists and gynaecologists asked them to send serum samples to the NCL if they identified patients from these risk groups who had been at the farmers' market during the outbreak. farmers' market in Soest for all patients notified with Q-fever. notified case defined as any person with a clinical diagnosis compatible with Q fever. local health departments also reported whether a notified case was hospitalized. the relative distance of the stands to the sheep pen was estimated by counting the stands between the sheep pen and the stand in question. the direction of the wind in relation to the sheep pen was defined by dividing the wind rose (360\u00b0) in 4 equal parts of 90\u00b0. the predominant wind direction during the market was south-south-east. interviews for recruitment of controls allowed proportion of adults that acquired symptomatic Q fever among those who visited the farmers' market on the second day. sailor friends interviewed patients about the number of persons that had accompanied them to the farmers' market. calculations to estimate the attack rate among adults were performed both with and without this source. environmental investigation Serum was collected from all sheep and cows displayed in the farmers' market as well as from all sheep of the respective home flocks (70 animals) samples of 25 sheep from five other flocks in the Soest area were also tested for C. burnetii. all CCS1 cases reported fever (100%), 20/21 (95%) reported fatigue, 19/20 (95%) had weight loss of more than 2 kg, 20/22 (91%) had joint pain, 14/19 (74%) had muscle pain, and 13/22 (59%) had headache. no significant association with a visit to the farmers' market on may 3, 2003. 158 (53%) were male and 140 (47%) were female. of the 298 cases with known gender, 158 (53%) were male and 140 (47%) were female. only eight (3%) cases were less than 18 years of age. no information was available as to whether the 132 cases without laboratory confirmation were laboratory tested. two (11%) of 18 cardiological patients and four (36%) of 11 pregnant women had an acute Q fever infection. 20 cases indicated that they had seen the cow compared to 7 (32%) of 22 controls. only 19 (79%) of 24 controls remembered having seen the sheep. touching the sheep was significantly more common among cases (5/20 (25%) CCS2 cases. 4 (9%) of 44 vendors became cases, compared to 2 (13%) of 15 people who worked in section 1 (p = 0.6) a small group of 9 sailors who visited the farmers' market on may 4, 2003, 6 had positive titers for C. burnetii. a \"most likely scenario\" was calculated before we varied the different assumptions. the organizers estimated that on may 4 about 3000 persons visited the market. the total number of adult visitors was estimated as 2490. 291 291 291 291 Proportion of reported adults 58% 100% 81% 100% 54% 65% 32% 43% 22% Number of children at farmers market 510 800 800 200 200 2000 2000 500 500 Number of reported children 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 Estimated number of ill children 14 8 10 8 15 12 25 19 37 Estimated AR (children) 2,7% 1,0% 1,2% 4,0% 7,4% 0,6% 1,2% 3,7% 7,4% Estimated total diseased. wes, 17/67 (25%) tested positive for C. burnetii. the percentage of sheep that tested positive in the other 5 sheep flocks in the region ranged from 8% to 24% (8%; 12%; 12%; 16%; 24%) farmers' market had taken place in a spa town. two CCS1 cases did not visit the farmers' market on may 4. on may 5 they were in the park where the market had taken place. the date of illness onset ranged between May 6 and June 21, 2003. 75 (25%) of 297 notified cases were hospitalized, none died. the interval between the day of onset and may 4 yields the incubation period. one year follow-up of two newborn children identified neither acute nor chronic Q fever infections. one year follow-up of two newborn children (of cases 1 and 3) identified neither acute nor chronic Q fever infections. 17 (85%) of 20 CCS2 cases, but only 6 (25%) of 24 controls stopped for at least a few seconds at or in the sheep pen. self-reported proximity to or time spent with/close to the sheep was not associated with a shorter incubation period. farmers' market on may 4, 2003, 6 had positive titers for C. burnetii. in this small group 50% of persons with positive serology had manifest disease. adults then the number of reported children/reporting rate gives the estimated number of ill children. therefore the estimated AR among children was 14/510 = 2.7%. the total estimated number of persons with clinical Q fever would be 498 + 14 = 512. most likely scenario: 3000 visitors, 83% adult visitors and 20% clinical attack rate among adults. most likely scenario: 3000 visitors, 83% adult visitors and 20% clinical attack rate among adults. most likely scenario: 3000 visitors, 83% adult visitors and 8 other scenarios. ario 5 Scenario 6 Scenario 7 Scenario 8 Total number of visitors 3000 2000 2000 2000 2000 5000 5000 % adult visitors 83% 60% 60% 90% 90% 90% Number of adult visitors at farmers market 2490 1200 1200 1800 3000 3000 4500 4500 Estimated AR (adults) 20% 30% 30% 30% 30% Estimated number of ill adults 498 180 360 360 360 270 540 450 900 675 1350 Number of reported adults 291 291 291 291 17/67 (25%) tested positive for C. burnetii. the percentage of sheep that tested positive in the other 5 sheep flocks in the region ranged from 8% to 24%. in 1954, more than 500 cases of Q fever were linked to the abortion of an infected cow. the incubation period of cases averaged 21 days and ranged from 2 to 48 days with an interquartile range of 16 to 24 days. a short incubation period was recently observed in another Q fever outbreak in which the infectious dose was likely very high[17]. the estimated attack rate among adults in the four studies varied between 16% and 33%. the estimate based on information about persons accompanying the cases may be subject to an overestimation because these individuals presumably had a higher probability of being close to the sheep pen. however, all estimates were independent from each other. children are at lower risk than adults for developing symptomatic illness. the estimated seroprevalence in sheep flocks in the area varied from 8% to 24%. the median seroprevalence in sheep flocks related to human outbreaks was 40% compared to 1% in sheep flocks not linked to human outbreaks.
