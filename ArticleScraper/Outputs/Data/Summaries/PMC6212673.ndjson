{"summary": "the most common respiratory viruses that affect susceptible population are human orthopneumovirus (hRSV), influenza virus (IV), coronavirus (CoV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) these viruses have in common the ability to produce bronchiolitis and pneumonia, being responsible for large numbers of hospitalizations every winter season. neurological abnormalities found in patients with severe respiratory illness have a spread spectrum of clinical signs, being the most reported seizures (Niizuma et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016); status epilepticus (Sweetman et al., 2005; Vehapoglu et al., 2015); encephalopathies (Antonucci and Fanos, 2005; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Niizuma e brile seizures Myelitis Meningitis Encephalitis Guillain-Barre syndrome Acute necrotizing encephalopathy Depression Neuritis Altered state of consciousness Dellirium Abnormal behavior Pandemic H1N1 isolated from brain post-mortem. the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the first line of defense that prevents the entry of pathogens into the brain. it is composed by cerebral microvascular endothelium, astrocytes, pericytes and extracellular matrix. several routes of CNS invasion can be used by viral pathogens. disruption of BBB permeability by destabilization of TJs allow viral entry into the brain in a paracellular transmigration way. this event is a consequence of a systemic infection that releases inflammatory mediators\u2014such as cytokines and chemokines. olfactory nerve has particularity to be in communication with the nasal epithelium and also with the olfactory bulb, the gateway to the CNS. this route is commonly used by respiratory viruses that infect the CNS but is not the only one. the most common respiratory viruses that affect susceptible population are human orthopneumovirus. neurological abnormalities found in patients with severe respiratory illness have a spread spectrum of clinical signs, being the most reported seizures (Niizuma et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016), status epilepticus (Sweetman et al., 2005; Vehapoglu et al., 2015), encephalopathies (Antonucci and Fanos, 2005; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Mizuguchi e Cappel et al. (1975); Hirayama et al. (1999); Ng et al. (1999); Zlateva and Van Ranst (2004); Otake et al. (2007); Kawashima et al. (2009, 2012) and Morichi et al. (2016) Influenza Febrile or afebrile seizures Myelitis Meningitis Encephalitis Guillain-Barre syndrome Acute necrotizing the blood-brain and the blood-CSF barriers play an important role in protecting the brain of free passage of unwanted molecules, pathogens and cells. the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the first line of defense that prevents the entry of pathogens into the brain. transendothelial mechanism is transcytosis across BMECs and pericytes by endocytic vesicles. another transcellular entry method is the infection of endothelial cells. this event is a consequence of a systemic infection that releases inflammatory mediators. infect and migrate through the nerve ending which can be sensory or motor. an alternative route for neuroinvasion is the transport through olfactory neurons. this pathway is an excellent mechanism to access CNS for viruses that enter the body intranasally. this route is commonly used by respiratory viruses that infect the CNS. human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) spreads from lungs to the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous route altering the local homeostasis. hRSV infection was associated with neurological abnormalities such as encephalitis. in the CSF, a high number of leucocytes was found; however, they could not detect hRSV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the authors concluded that this child manifested a meningoencephalitis with cerebellitis associated with hRSV-infection. exhibited neurological abnormalities were analyzed to evaluate the contribution of cytokines in this phenomenon. the results showed an increase of IL-6 in the CSF but not in serum, which suggests a local effect. the authors suggest that their result support the idea of a direct invasion of the CNS by hRSV. excitotoxic encephalopathy is characterized by febrile convulsion status epilepticus. hRSV RNA was found in five of the nine patients analyzed. levels of nitric oxide (NO) were significantly increased independently of the encephalopathy type. authors analyzed a low number of cases, but found that in two patients with non-evaluated encephalopathy, IL-6 and BDNF were significantly elevated. only IL-6 and BDNF correlated with PCPC scores, indicating that in more damaged patients, the secretion of these molecules is elevated. these tools are now an import advantage in the understanding of the neuropathies associated with hRSV-infection. histological analyses showed an association between necrosis and liquefaction in the brain with the clinical signs of encephalitis in the mice. authors hypothesized that hRSV infects not only pulmonary neurons but also that the G-hRSV glycoprotein can interact with the chemokine receptor for CX3CL1 expressed in these cells. the authors observed that viral genome and proteins could be detected in the brain of the infected mice, mainly in cortex, hippocampus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) later they evaluated a possible route of entry for hRSV into the brain by using a blocking antibody for CD49d. the results showed a decrease of viral load in the brain of hRSV-infected mice previously treated with anti-CD49d. using neuronal N2a cells as hRSV-infection model was performed. this virus infects these cells and viral titers increased up until 96 h post-infection. despite this new knowledge, there is no in vivo evidence that hRSV infects neurons or other resident cells. AV), B (IBV), C (ICV) and D (IDV) viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. they are the only members of their respective genus, within the Unassigned order. there are 18 different HA subtypes (H1-H18) described. have been observed in patients including encephalitis (Newland et al., 2003), myelitis (Salonen et al., 1997; Zlateva and Van Ranst, 2004; Xia et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2004); meningitis (Liang et al., 2018); seizures (Chiu et al., 2001) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (T in a cohort of 74 hospitalized children, 19% of them presented neurologic complications mainly seizures. only one patient from this study was diagnosed with transverse myelitis and permanent sequelae. a study described in 21 patients of a wide range of age with neurological alterations showed that the primary clinical sign was encephalitis and about 50% of the patients have sequelae. seasonal IAV H3N2 was detected in MDCK cells, identified as the cause of the neurological symptoms of the patient. the presence of neuroradiological diagnosis suggests that the phenotype observed in patients may be a cause of direct viral invasion into the CNS. a study in Japan reveals that patients with neurological manifestations also had mild impairment of consciousness, typically delirium or hallucinations and abnormal behavior among others. the most critical finding was that viral antigens were detected in the vagal and trigeminal ganglia at day 3 post-infection. this event was preceded by the early infection of the nasal cavity, trachea and lungs. the hypothesis of the transneural invasion was corroborated in a study performed by Matsuda et al. (2004). a loss in dopaminergic neurons in about a 17% began as a local immune response that could contribute to CNS disease as described in humans. the recovery of the neuronal lasted until 90 days post-infection and that, mainly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the profile of cytokines was altered due to the H5N1 infection. the first focus of the research was to evaluate the systemic spread of the mouse-adapted H1N1 (NWS/33; Yu et al., 2014). the results showed viral detection in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex among other zones. the H1N1 infection does not lead to long-term impairment in spatial memory nor affects the neuron morphology. the H3N2 subtype is not able to replicate in the CNS. however, it is capable of increasing the levels of TNF- in the hippocampus and also increase the number of microglia. coVs are enveloped viruses with a positive non-segmented single-stranded RNA genome of about 30 Kb of length, one of the largest among the RNA viruses. they codify for four structural proteins\u2014five in some BCoV\u2014and several non-structural proteins comprised mostly on two ORFs. non-structural proteins are the leading cause of host immune system modulation. viral entry is mediated through the interaction of viral Spike (S) protein and cellular CECAM-1 receptor. from there, the virus can replicate its RNA and translate it into proteins. the prevalence of HCoV-229E in MS samples was statistically higher than in control patients. the first case of SARS-CoV infection with neurological manifestations was reported the year 2003 in a 59-year-old woman. she was first admitted with swinging fever, chills, productive coughing and diarrhea. the respiratory failure continued until she was sedated, and ventilation was required. HCoV enters the CNS through the olfactory bulb, causing inflammation and demyelination. Upon nasal infection, HCoV can reach the whole brain and CSF in less than 7 days. a case report of HCoV-OC43 detection in nasopharyngeal and CSF samples from a child patient was performed the year 2004. chemokine induced by IFN- (CXCL9, a CXC chemokines family member) and IFN--inducible protein 10 (CXCL10) were highly induced in brain samples from a deceased patient. however, there are reports about high levels of CXCL10 in SARS-CoV infected patients, with no neurological manifestations. HCoV exhibits an intrinsic capability to infect neural cells and spread from CNS to the periphery via a transneural route. the disease at CNS as elucidated by both viruses are similar, as they both induce demyelination. jacomy and Talbot were among the first to describe a mouse model to characterize the disease in their publication the year 2003. glial primary cultures of MHV-A59-infected cells showed an increase in the secretion of IL-12 p40, TNF-, IL-15 and IL-6 compared with a non-neurotropic MHV. glial primary cultures of MHV-A59-infected cells showed an increase in the secretion of IL-12 p40, TNF-, IL-15 and IL-6 compared with a non-neur hMPV belongs to the Mononegavirales order, Pneumoviridae family and the Metapneumovirus genus (Amarasinghe et al., 2018; King et al., 2018). hMPV belongs to the Mononegavirales order, Pneumoviridae family and the Metapneumovirus genus (Amarasinghe et al., 2018; King et al., 2018). a 14-month-old boy was received in a primary care hospital with a fever and unresponsiveness to stimulus, either verbal or tactile. after 10 days of hospitalization, the child was considered dead and was extubated. autopsies revealed the presence of genetic material of hMPV in both brain and lungs, and no other virus, such as hRSV or HSV, were detected. 145 of the samples were positive for this virus and only one of the patients was reported with seizures. the second group consisted solely of patients hospitalized with high fever or any CNS abnormality, ranging from the age of 6-month-old to 18 years old. they also described another patient with hMPV-infection and detection of genetic material of enterovirus in CSF. a 3.5-year-old girl with hMPV respiratory disease was reported the year 2013. the year 2014, two cases were reported, a 15-month old and a 18-month-old girl. these three cases were discharged without apparent sequelae. the year 2015, the first reported case of a child with refractory status epilepticus was described. most recently, cases of adults with acute encephalitis and hMPV detection have been described. most recently, cases of adults with acute encephalitis and hMPV detection have been described. a 47-year-old man was found unconscious after 2 days of respiratory symptoms and immediately hospitalized. the patient was treated for 1 week with ribavirin (unspecific antiviral) and eventually respiratory failure was diagnosed. no studies have been performed describing the ability of hMPV to cause CNS damage in mice. hMPV can persist in the lung of mice after acute infection. most prominent respiratory viruses are hRSV, IV, CoV and hMPV. extra-pulmonary symptoms have been described in these viruses. cases of children, elderly and even adults exhibiting these symptoms have been described throughout the years. authors have made substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
