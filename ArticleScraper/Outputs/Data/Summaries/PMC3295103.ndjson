{"summary": "there are three serotypes of MDV, differing in their virulence in chicken or their ability to induce T-cell lymphomas and antigenic properties. serotype 1 MDVs are oncogenic, and based on their virulence, serotype 1 MDVs can be further classified as mild (m), virulent (v), very virulent (vv), and very virulent plus (vv+) strains (16, 17) notomi et al. developed a novel technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) this technique requires four different primers, Bst DNA polymerase to displace DNA strands, and isothermal conditions for the amplification of target DNA. this technique requires only 30 to 60 min and can be performed at a single temperature ranging from 60\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C. samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. total DNA was extracted with a Charge switch DNA extraction kit. purity and concentration of the extracted DNAs were estimated. the digested LAMP products produced 110- and 70-bp fragments by electrophoresis. the outer primers (F3 and B3), inner primers (FIP and BIP) and loop primers (LF and LR) are complementary to the indicated regions of the target sequence. PCR amplification of the MEQ gene of serotype 1 MDV was performed with the LAMP F3 and B3 primers. the 20-l reaction mixtures contained 10 l of PCR master mix (Genei, Bangalore, India), 10 pmol of each primer, approximately 100 ng of template DNA, and nuclease-free water. feather tips were collected and kept on ice for transportation. the samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. total DNA was extracted with a Charge switch DNA extraction kit. the mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 60 min in a water bath. the reaction was terminated by incubating the tubes at 800\u00b0C for 5 min. the amplified products produced 110- and 70-bp fragments by electrophoresis. PCR amplification of the MEQ gene of serotype 1 MDV was performed with the LAMP F3 and B3 primers. the 20-l reaction mixtures contained 10 l of PCR master mix (Genei, Bangalore, India), 10 pmol of each primer, approximately 100 ng of template DNA and nuclease-free water. nucleotide sequences were screened with the BLAST program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to confirm the presence of these sequences in all of the pathotypes of serotype 1 MDV. the plasmid containing the 180-bp MEQ gene fragment was serially diluted. each plasmid concentration (copies/tube) was subjected to both the LAMP and PCR assays. each plasmid concentration (copies/tube) was subjected to both the LAMP and PCR assays. amplification of the 180-bp fragment of the MEQ gene from serotype 1 MDV. YBR green I dye to terminated LAMP reaction. negative reactions for SB1 DNA, HVT DNA template, and healthy chicken DNA looked brown. stability of the LAMP master mix was studied for 120 days. the nucleotide sequences were screened with the BLAST program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to confirm the presence of these sequences in all pathotypes of serotype 1 MDV. the sequences and locations are shown in Fig. 1. the plasmid containing the 180-bp MEQ gene fragment of the Ind/KA01/06 isolate was serially diluted. each plasmid concentration (copies/tube) was subjected to both the LAMP and PCR assays. each plasmid concentration was subjected to both the LAMP and PCR assays. the LAMP reaction for positive field isolates fluoresced apple green. negative reactions for SB1 DNA, HVT DNA template, and healthy chicken DNA looked brown. stability of the LAMP master mix was studied for 120 days. serotype 1 MDV infections pose a serious threat to the poultry industry. it is important to establish simple, rapid, and reliable methods for diagnosis. PCR is the diagnostic method used most widely. however, it requires the use of expensive equipment and costly consumables. the high sensitivity of the LAMP system makes it susceptible to false-positive results due to carryover or cross-contamination. the detection limit of the MDV assay was determined by amplification of recombinant plasmid DNA, which carries the MEQ gene of serotype 1 MDV. the detection limit of the detection limit was 10-fold higher than that of conventional PCR assay. the MDV LAMP assay described above did not amplify other serotypes of MDV, including SB-1 (serotype 2) and HVT (serotype 3), nor did the assay amplify the DNA of normal, healthy chicken. the primers were BLASTed against the complete genomes of other avian oncogenic and related viruses. there is some experimental evidence to suggest that a single point mutation in the pp38 gene can be used for such differentiation. however, as it is only a tandem repeat of an existing sequence, it will not be a suitable target for PCR-based differentiation."}
