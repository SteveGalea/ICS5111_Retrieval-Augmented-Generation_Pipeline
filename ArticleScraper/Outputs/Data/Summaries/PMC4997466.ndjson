{"summary": "the largest outbreak, recently, began in Guinea in December 2013. the infected initially experienced atypical clinical symptoms of fever, headache, joint/muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [13,14] the actual number of the infected could be even higher than announced by WHO. 97.4% of netizens chose Baidu as the comprehensive website in the last six months [20]. social media still has its market with user populations accounting for 40.7% of Internet users. in china, BDI has also been proved to predict the potential cases of epidemic erythromelalgia, and monitor influenza epidemics. but the utilization of Chinese cyber indices, like BDI and SMI, for the purposes of health education was limited. this network-based digital epidemiologic study was based on the online data retrieved from 20 July to 4 September 2014. the daily BDI was recognized as a vital data source, which could provide information involving the weighted sum of search frequency for a keyword. the average BDI was calculated to identify the mean attention of the netizens (1/100 million) in each province and some cities. the general autocorrelation analysis included general autocorrelation analysis and local autocorrelation analysis. the results would be determined as a clustered distribution, dispersed distribution, or random distribution. the BDI and SMI were collected from the websites of Baidu Index and Sina Micro Index daily. all of the Ebola-related data, including the number of cases and deaths, were collected from the websites of the world health organization, centers for disease control and prevention and national ministries of health (USA) and netizen data were from the 33rd Statistical Report on Internet Development in China [31]. media events were retrieved from two sources: the headlines by the Baidu Index and Baidu News [32] the former does not carry news headlines of the same topic every day, especially of topics with minor fluctuations of BDI. the collected media events were abstracted and categorized as positive or negative news. time scan statistics were carried out to recognize the special cities/provinces with high attention to \u201cEbola\u201d [34]. the parameters of the maximum spatial cluster size and maximum temporal cluster size used the default settings (50%) the log likelihood ratio was calculated through comparing the real average BDI with the expected average BDI. a Monte Carlo test (p 0.05) was used to determine the most likely clustered regions. the BDI for the keyword of \u201cEbola\u201d increased sharply from 29 July. it peaked at 101,222 on 1 August and its BDI declined with fluctuations. it dropped again on 15 August and reached a lower peak at 79,939. after that, the BDI of \u201cEbola\u201d stayed at a lower level between 10,000 and 20,000, but higher than that before 29 July. correlation analysis was carried out to explore potential case-related indicators resulting in the fluctuation of public attention. results showed no correlation between all case-related influencing indicators and the BDI (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05). no correlation was identified between adjusted BDI and case-related influencing indicators (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05) no correlation was identified between the adjusted BDI and case-related influencing indicators (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05). data scale ranged from 17 to 88,761 with a median of 7756 during the study period. no correlation was found between case-related influencing indicators and the SMI. a local spatial autocorrelation analysis was then performed to identify the hotspot through local Getis\u2019s Gi*. the most likely cluster was identified in the 13 regions of china from 30 July\u201314 August 2014. the BDI/SMI dropped in the next few days from their first peak. a suspected case in Hong Kong led to the decline after the second peak. negative news might increase public reaction while positive news might just do the opposite. at 101,222 on 1 August, its BDI declined with fluctuations, remaining at a high level above 50,000 between 2 and 9 August. it dropped again on 15 August and reached a lower peak at 79,939. the data scale ranged from 399 to 101,222, with a median of 25,421 during the study period. Xinjiang 446 1094 0.41 Shanxi 714 1755 0.41 Qinghai 195 274 0.71 Hebei 1442 3389 0.43 Hainan 366 411 0.89 Shaanxi 966 1689 0.57 Shandong 1576 4329 0.36 Ningxia 210 283 0.74 Hubei 1113 2491 0.45 Jilin 579 1163 0.50 Heilongjiang 661 1514 0.44 Guangxi 863 1774 0.49 no correlation was identified between the adjusted BDI and case-related influencing indicators (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05). this results are detailed in Figure 4A, and Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7. netizens were gathered to investigate the average attention as indicated by the average BDI in separated regions. the top five cities/provinces in terms of the average BDI were Beijing, Tibet, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hainan. correlation analysis was carried out to explore potential case-related indicators. the associated analyses were performed of the BDI and cumulative fatality rate, BDI and cumulative case, BDI and cumulative death case, and BDI and new reported case. the correlation analysis between the adjusted Baidu Index and the adjusted Sina Micro Index of \u201cEbola\u201d associated with case-related data from 20 July to 4 September in 2014. no correlation was found between case-related influencing. no correlation was identified between adjusted SMI and case-related influencing indicators (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05) no correlation was identified between the adjusted SMI and case-related indicators (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05) the associated analyses were performed of the SMI and cumulative fatality rate, SMI and cumulative case, and SMI and cumulative death case. no correlation was found between case-related influencing indicators and the SMI (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, p > 0.05). correlated analyses were also conducted of the adjusted SMI and new reported case. the most likely cluster was identified in the 13 regions of china from 30 July\u201314 August 2014. it included 13 cities/provinces, including Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jilin, Shaanxi, and Shanghai. BDI and SMI could mirror the public attention in a timely manner. the highest BDI was observed in Guangdong, the province with the largest number of internet users in China. comparable public attention to the Ebola outbreak was captured in china. a spatio-temporal analysis had identified 13 clustered regions with higher average attention in china from 30 July to 14 august. the daily BDI indicated higher attention than other periods in china. this might be attributable to the fact that Ebola epidemics did not occur in China. high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information. traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. this modality, different from traditional epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. BDI and SMI were used to identify the public\u2019s reaction to the Ebola outbreak in west africa from 20 July to 4 September in 2014. BDI and SMI could mirror the public attention in a timely manner, while conventional methods might cause bias. the highest BDI was observed in Guangdong, the province with the largest number of internet users in China. this might be partly attributed to the opportunities brought about by China\u2019s booming economy. also, the highest average attention to the Ebola outbreak was found in china. the peaks of BDI and SMI were usually accompanied with negative news reports and the decline of the indices followed the positive reports. a suspected Ebola case in Hong Kong might serve as the vital reason for the first peak of BDI and SMI. new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. different interventions should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education. online surveillance reflected significant attention in the population to the outbreak. BDI and SMI were rapid and efficient in identifying and evaluating public reactions. compared to domestic outbreaks of epidemic diseases, EVD might affect the public reaction through positive and negative news reports."}
