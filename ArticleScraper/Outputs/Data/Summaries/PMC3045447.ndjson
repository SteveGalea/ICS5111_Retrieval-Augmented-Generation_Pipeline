{"summary": "conventional X-ray imaging is based purely on absorption resulting in very low contrast when imaging soft tissues without contrast agents. a recently emerged imaging technique, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) was used. it enabled high-resolution investigations of soft tissues without contrast agents. phase contrast imaging (PCI) is a relatively new imaging technique. it can provide high contrast images by using phase shift of the X-ray. this technique may lead to very low contrast and poor spatial resolution. a few studies have involved in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging to investigate lung of small animals. due to the significant difference in density between air and tissues, the inner edges of the airway can result in marked edge enhancement. despite advances in lung imaging using IL-XPCI, three-dimensional visualization of the alveoli in the intact animals has remained elusive. IL-XPCI Computed tomography study was performed on a 1-day-old mouse. results showed that the major features of the lung, including bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli can be clearly displayed. 3D models of tissues in the mouse chest cavity were obtained. a surface rendering view of lung is displayed. the three-dimensional relationships between bronchiole, alveolar duct and alveoli were all visible. Immature 1-day-old mouse alveoli range in diameter from 100 to 150 m [15] the diameter of most alveoli in our reconstruction image was in this range. the lungs are composed of sponge-like soft tissues. detecting soft tissues using conventional absorption-based radiography is limited by the variation in tissue density. clinical thin-section CT can be used to visualize airways with an internal diameter larger than 2 mm. the resolution of PCI is adequate for micro-structures observation in lung. an intact mouse was used to the maximum extent to preserve the organ's original morphology. this process cannot be visualized in living embryos. in conventional radiography, it is impossible to conduct alveoli imaging without contrast agent. the imaging of alveoli has shown promising results without any contrast agent. the 3D reconstruction technique provided an excellent view of lung and revealed structural details that were invisible. live animals can only be imaged in two dimensions. the major obstacle in realizing this is the motion artifacts caused by breathing and cardiac motion of the animals. high-speed X-ray phase tomography may be another solution to live animal imaging by substantially reducing the imaging time. the study sample was a 1-day-old mouse, provided by laboratory animal science, Capital Medical University. the mouse was humanely sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection overdose. a piece of Kapton (Dupont, DE, USA) was used and rolled up into a tube. in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging experiment was performed at SSRF. it consisted of two monochromator crystals, one automatic rotation sample stage and one X-ray sensitive CCD detector. an image detector records them as the phase contrast image. m13 m each, was used as a two-dimensional detector to transform the beam into an image. the specimen was rotated around its cylinder axis for 180\u00b0. the number of projections was 1296, with exposure time of 80 milliseconds for each projection. threshold-based image segmentation method was inadequate to separate the bronchial tree from the whole lung airways. it started in manually placing the seed point in the section of bronchus as well as setting the intensity threshold. under the control of the intensity threshold the growing would stop when the bronchial tree were separated. X-ray beams travel through the object, the downstream beams carry the information of absorption and phase shift. they are given by (2) (3) where is the wavelength of the X-ray. an image detector records them as the phase contrast image. the incident white synchrotron X-ray beam was first monochromatized by two Si (111) prefect crystals. the tunable energy range was from 8 to 72.5 keV, with the energy resolution of about 0.5%. in our experiment, it was adjusted to 18 keV. the ribs are bone structures, which had a distinct gray scale in PCI reconstructed CT slices. filtered back projection algorithm was used for the segmentation of ribs. an image segmentation method was applied to separate the lung tissues from the background. the entire lung airways can be segmented from this volume dataset by manually setting a gray-level threshold. model can be cut from any angle to give a detailed view of the inner part of the lung. the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli are all visible."}
