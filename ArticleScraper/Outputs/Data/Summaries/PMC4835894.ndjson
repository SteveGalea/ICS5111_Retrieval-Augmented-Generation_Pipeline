{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a leading cause of viral encephalitis. it is characterized by extensive neuroinflammation following infection with neurotropic JE virus (JEV) the in vivo role of IDO activity has not been fully addressed in neurotropic virus-caused encephalitis. antiviral ISG genes (Mx1, Mx2, ISG49, ISG54, ISG56) also enhanced the IFN-I innate response in neuron cells, which may delay the spread of virus in the CNS."}
