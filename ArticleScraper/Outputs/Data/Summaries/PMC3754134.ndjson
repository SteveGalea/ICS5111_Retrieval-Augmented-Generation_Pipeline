{"summary": "between June 2012 and 22 May 2013, infections caused by this virus, now called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, resulted in 21 deaths among 43 confirmed cases worldwide (2). such an alarming mortality rate of close to 50% has reignited public concern about its potential for resulting in a pandemic like that of the 2002-to-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that emerged first in Asia. polarized human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells are susceptible to ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV infection exclusively through the apical surface. in this study, we first compared the infectivity characteristics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and three other human cell lines. despite the fact that MERS-CoV failed to replicate as dynamically as SARS-CoV at both 8 and 32 h pi (P 0.01), it consistently induced readily detectable CPE at 16 h with 20% monolayer detachment, which rapidly progressed to 70% and 100% at 24 and 32 h pi. we also established the \u201cone-step\u201d growth curves of MERS-CoV versus SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells. 80% and 88% cell death within 1 day and 2 days 2 pi. CD26/DPP4 glycoprotein has been shown to express on many cell types. subsets of T cells and/or dendritic cells expressing CD26/DPP4 were also as susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. trypan blue exclusion assay was used to simultaneously monitor viability and mortality of infected Jurkat T cells. MERS-CoV has been shown to be more vulnerable than SARS-CoV to prior treatments with IFN-/ and IFN- in primary HAEC and Calu-3 cells. prior IFN- treatment effectively inhibits the replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. the infected monolayer was fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%)\u2013phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for documentation of infectious viruses. annexin V+/PI staining is regarded as representative of early-stage apoptosis. annexin V+/PI+ and annexin V/PI+ staining is regarded as representative of late-stage apoptosis or necrosis. annexin V+/PI+ staining is regarded as representative of late-stage apoptosis. and 3, along with uninfected controls, were subjected to examination by using an inverted phase-contrast fluorescence microscope (Olympus 1X71) annexin V+/PI cells emerged as the dominant cell type associated with foci of CPE. annexin V+/PI cells emerged as the dominant cell type associated with foci of CPE (Bright field, arrows) nuclei of mock-infected cells (A) or SARS-CoV-infected cells (B) possess a homogeneously round and smooth morphology without detectable CCP3 expression. FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide staining was used to discriminate between early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells. the entry receptor of MERS-CoV, CD26/DPP4, like ACE2, was preferentially expressed on the apical domain of Calu-3 cells. to this end, we fixed Calu-3 cells grown onto chamber slides with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with a primary antibody specifically against human CD26/DPP4. to test this, we established highly polarized Calu-3 cells in the transwell system (Costar) polarized cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV (B) or MERS-CoV/EMC-2012 (C), at an MOI of 0.1, through either the apical or basolateral surface. titer was released basolaterally when infection was carried out from the basolateral rather than the apical routes. to infect through the basolateral domain of highly differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells is compatible with a blood-borne dissemination of virus."}
