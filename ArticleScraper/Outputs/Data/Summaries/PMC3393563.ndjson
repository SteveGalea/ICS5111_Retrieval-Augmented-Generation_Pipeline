{"summary": "porcine enteroviruses (PEVs) belong to the family Picornaviridae (3). they are the causative agents of neurological disorders, fertility disorders, and dermal lesions of swine (6). pigs in central and eastern china from 2007 to 2009 were positive for this virus. the genome organization of this virus is identical to that of previously published CPE group III strains (1, 6, 10) over the whole genome, the virus shows the highest sequence homology, 82.4%, with PEV9 strains (GenBank nucleotide sequence accession no. Y14459), it shows 77.5% sequence identity. the virus genome sequence was deposited in GenBank with strain name Ch-ah-f1 and GenBank accession no. HM131607. the virus genome sequence was deposited in GenBank with strain name Ch-ah-f1 and GenBank accession no. HM131607."}
