{"summary": "the cumulative SARS cases reported to the WHO from 29 countries were 8098, with 774 deaths (1,2) because the pathogenesis is still under study, there is no effective treatment as yet (6). natural herbal medicine (NHM) has been used to control infectious diseases for thousands of years. a suspect case of SARS that is positive for SARS coronavirus by one or more assays should be excluded. a case should be excluded: (I) If an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness. sachet of NHM A weighed 120 gm, to which we added 600 ml water. each day, 250 ml of this elixir, diluted 1:200 with water, were taken by the subject. the first CHM or placebo was administered within 12 h after the patient was admitted. the treatment lasted throughout hospitalization. western medical doctors in charge of the patients prescribed the following. setting and patients Our hospital (Taipei Hospital, Taiwan) was committed to take care of local SARS patients in the middle of March, 2003. the subjects were recruited from April 25, 2003 to June 30, 2003. the subjects were recruited from April 25, 2003 to June 30, 2003. a clinical herb trial notification and a letter in which we explained how to take the NHM were given soon after the patient was admitted. the patients were fully blind to the herb trial. NHM B was a health-care product popularly used in Taiwan. it was made from the elixir of Agaricus brazei Murill, Panax ginseng and Cordyceps sinensis. every day, 250 ml of this elixir, diluted 1:200 with water, were taken. patients prescribed the following: Robatrol (Ribavirin, 200 mg) 10 tablets loading, then 2 tablets am and three tablets pm for 10\u201314 days. the patients were usually given extra steroid, such as methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol, 40 mg) 1 vial intravenous injection every 8 hours for a 2\u20133 day course, and the dose then tapered. nasopharyngeal washing specimens, deep throat gargles and blood of the patients were submitted to our Disease Control Bureau for SARS-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination (13\u201317) we also sampled the patients\u2019 serum during hospitalization and after discharge for SARS-CoV antibody (16\u201319) the demographic and clinical profiles of each group at the time of admission were indistinguishable from one another. the demographic and clinical profiles of each group were indistinguishable from one another. rate Robatrol 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.35 Intravenous immunoglobulin 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.58 Steroid 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.61 Antibiotics 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.00 Initial data Radiographic scores 2.1 (1.2) 2.5 (1.6) 3.0 (2.7) 0.67 Lymphocytes, 109/l 1.4 (0.7) 1.0 (0.7) 1.3 (0.6) 0.71 Platelets, 109/l 235.1 (150.1) 186.8 ( Expired Case A 36-year-old female patient in group C passed away. her severe radiographic scores were 16 on the ninth day after onset of disease. three patients developed mild diarrhea and one patient had upper abdominal discomfort after taking NHM A. group B Mean (SD) (n = 8) Group C Mean (SD) (n = 8) P Variables Age, years old 34.8 (9.4) 39.9 (13.2) 39.5 (8.8) 0.46 Sex ratio, 3:5 5:3 4:4 0.61 Positive of PCR or antibody rate 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.84 Days after disease onset before enrolled in the trial 3.3 (1.0) 3.3 (2.0) 3.5 (1.6) 0.94 Initial vital signs Body temperature, patients from group A took less days before showing improvement (6.7 1.8) compared with Group C (11.2 4.9) no significant statistical difference in chest radiographic scores was found among the groups. Expired Case A 36-year-old female patient in group C passed away. her severe radiographic scores were 16 on the ninth day after onset of disease. no patients withdrew from the study because of discomfort or adverse effects associated with the treatment. no patients nor doctors-in-charge knew to which herbal trial group each patient was assigned. the Chinese medical team did not interfere with the management decision on each patient. study was designed only to detect changes in IRS and DI. however, there are gaps in our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of SARS. avian influenza A (H5N1) has caused much concern among health professionals. different pathogens are involved in SARS, SARS-like diseases and avian influenza. all of them are severe infectious diseases with similar clinical presentations."}
