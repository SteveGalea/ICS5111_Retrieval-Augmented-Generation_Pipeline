{"summary": "2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the world health organization [3] from 27 countries. most reported cases were from countries in the Middle East, among which 82% occurred in Saudi Arabia. other cases were reported from north africa, Europe, the USA and East Asia. the case fatality rate of MERS-CoV ranges from 30% to 60%. severe disease presentation is correlated with pre-existing medical conditions. the present paper aims to investigate the effect of comorbidities on the mortality rate of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia. samples that tested positive for both upE and ORF1a genes were considered as confirmed cases. each patient was tested at least twice and each test was conducted on a different day. no reported symptoms at the time of a positive test recorded by a healthcare provider in the medical chart. in symptomatic cases, patients reported their symptoms during hospital admission. RT-PCR tests were performed at the regional laboratory in Riyadh. Mortality in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia between 23 April 2014 and 7 June 2016 survival OR (95% CI) P-value Alive (n = 226) (%) Died (n = 55) (%) Total (n = 281) (%) Sex Male 130 (57.5) 37 (67.3) 167 (59.4) 1.517 (0.815\u20132.827) 0.187 Female 96 (42.5) 18 (32.7) 114 (40.6) Nationality Saudi 127 (56.2) 39 1 (1.8) 23 (8.2) 0.171 (0.022\u20131.302) 0.083 Shortness of breath 82 (36.3) 34 (61.8) 116 (41.3) 2.843 (1.548\u20135.221) 0.001* Sore throat 22 (9.7) 0 (0) 22 (8) 0.081 (0.004\u20131.371) 0.08 Vomiting 10 (4.4) 4 (7.3) 14 (5) 1.6941 (0.510\u20135.619) 0.284 Chest pain 1 (0.4) 32 (14.2%) 15 (27.3%) 5.833 (2.33\u201314.56) 0.0217* Three (15 (6.6%) 13 (23.6%) 10.785 (1.930\u20139.818) 0.0004* Four 2 (0.9%) 0 (0%) 0.809 (0.038\u201317.092) 0.8917 Five 0 (0%) 1 (1.8%) 12.4679 (0.501\u2013310.273) 0.1239 Total number of comorbidities Mean s.d. 0.805 0.974 only four cases of asymptomatic patients died representing 1% of total 281 cases. three of these four were elderly aged more than 66-years-old with comorbidities (HTN and/or dementia) and one case aged 55-years-old and had additional multiple comorbidities (DM, HTN, COPD) the presence of two or three comorbidities significantly increased the risk of death from MERS-CoV infection. asthma 24 (10.6) 3 (5.5) 0.486 (0.141\u20131.675) 0.244 Myasthenia Gravis 0 (0) 1 (1.8) 12.467 (0.5010\u2013310.2738) 0.196 Colon cancer 1 (0.4) 0 (0) 1.354 (0.0544\u201333.6980) 0.804 Renal failure 1 (0.4) 0 (0) 1.354 (0.0544\u201333.6980) 0.804 End-stage renal disease 3 the mortality rate was 20% among the 281 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia between 23 April 2014 and 7 June 2016. the predominance of male cases is consistent with the findings reported in previous studies in Saudi Arabia and south Korea [19, 20], which may be associated with cultural or occupational behaviours in males that increase the risk of infection. obesity, cardiovascular, hypertension and neuromuscular disease were strongly associated with severe pandemic influenza [26]. comorbidities such as immunological, neurological, metabolic and dermatologic diseases were strongly associated with the disease [29]. this condition weakens the host's innate and humoral immune systems, thereby limiting their ability to counteract any new infection [30]."}
