{"summary": "single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies are composed of the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) domains of an immunoglobulin tethered by a peptide linker. they are easily engineered into higher order formats such as bispecific (including bispecific T-cell engagers), trispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptors, or IgG. the anti-EGFR scFv, C10, was previously identified from a phage antibody library and selected for its ability to promote EGFR internalization. however, it would be desirable to engineer more stable variants of these antibodies prior to further stages of drug development. a structure-guided redesign strategy involves a to switch to graft the VL CDRs of C10 and P2224 onto a more stable VL 3 framework. this is the first demonstration that a structure-guided redesign involving a to switch successfully improves the stability of an scFv while maintaining comparable binding affinity. we compared the protein sequences of the parental C10 light and heavy chains to human germline V-region sequences. the C10 heavy chain sequence (through the beginning of CDR H3) is 99% identical to the human IGHV1\u201369*01 amino acid sequence. fusion is not typically found in nature and V domains tend to confer lower production yields from bacteria and a greater propensity to aggregate. the hybrid V sequence was likely the source of poor production. IGKV3\u201320 was the most common, followed by IGKV1\u201339. the highest expression levels with IGHV1\u201369 were IGKV1\u20135, IGKV3\u201311, IGKV3\u201320, and IGKV3\u201315, all roughly equal. sequence of the light chain of PDB entry 1RHH was optimized with the program SCWRL4. parent and target structures were inspected visually for inconsistencies caused by the CDR grafts. d-e loop is a framework loop of the FR3 region. the loops are in light-blue (L1) and dark blue (d-e loop) the loops are in magenta (L1) and dark purple (d-e loop) the loops are in magenta (L1) and dark purple (d-e loop) the loops are in magenta (L1) and dark purple (d-e loop) hydroxyl makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone of residue 7 of the L1 loop, flipping the conformation of residues 7 and 8. light chains with 11-amino acid L1 CDRs exist almost entirely in cluster L1\u201311\u20133, with a distinct sequence pattern compared to L1\u201311\u20131 and L1\u201311\u20132 CDRs in antibodies. the structures of L1\u201311\u20133 CDRs are quite different from L1\u201311\u20131 and L1 the d-e loop bends inward toward the L1 loop. the -typical K/R/N/I side chains at position 66 result in a -sheet like backbone conformation with f 0\u00b0 (mean 141\u00b0; std = 21\u00b0) in 464 or 99% of 468 human domains in the PDB. we applied a refinement strategy in the program Rosetta that allows for changes in bond lengths and bond angles. each run consists of optimization moves in a random order so each resulting model (or decoy) is different. the distribution of scores for C10KV3_LV1DE is a little lower than C10KV3. the whiskers are at Q3+1.5*IQR and Q1\u20131.5*IQR, where IQR is the interquartile range (Q3-Q1). refinement of C10KV3_LV1DE from its initial model (cyan) to a structure with the lowest Rosetta score. redesigned VL CDR framework confers enhanced production of C10 and P2224 scFvs. the effect of the redesigned P2224KV3_LV1DE was even more dramatic when expressions were carried out at 30 \u00b0C. the yield of P2224KV3_LV1DE was approximately 8-fold greater than those obtained with P2224. the presence of the 3 d-e loop in C10KV3 decreased production of the scFv by approximately 2.5 fold. the Boltzmann derivative melt profiles of indicated scFv generated from differential scanning fluorimetry. data were generated on an Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Real-Time PCR System using continuous ramp mode at 0.5% ramp rate from 25 \u00b0C through 99 \u00b0C. a wavelength scan of scFv at 25\u00b0C pre-heat and post-heating at 80\u00b0C. all data is representative of at least 2 independent experiments. dynode voltage, which can be used to calculate absorbance, was recorded to measure the heat-induced aggregation of the scFvs. _LV1DE were calculated to be >99% monomeric at 25\u00b0C. the plots are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. a different mode of protein aggregation is also reflected in the CD-detected thermal unfolding curves. the majority of C10 and C10KV3_LV1DE are predominantly monomeric at 25\u00b0C. Upon heating to 60\u00b0C, very large aggregates can be seen in both C10 and C10KV3_LV1DE preparations. this unfolding and aggregation appears to be irreversible. the KDs for P2224, P2224KV3 and P2224KV3_LV1DE were calculated to be 2.79 nM, 1.49 nM, and 1.62 nM respectively. the 3-derived framework and d-e loop do not appear to alter affinity. scFv protein yields were significantly lower than those obtained with C10 at both temperatures. the affinity maturation process further destabilized the scFv relative to the parental molecule. 1DE from TG1 cells at 25 or 30 \u00b0C relative to C10 production. fold induction of C10KV3 or C10KV3_LV1DE. bars represent the range of fold production from 2 independent experiments. IGLV1\u201344*01 and IGLV3\u201319*01 germline amino acid sequences were the source of poor production. IGLV1\u201344*01 and IGLV3\u201319*01 were the most common germline amino acid sequences. the highest expression levels with IGHV1\u201369 were IGKV1\u20135, IGKV3\u201311, IGKV3\u201315, and IGKV1\u20135 (5 cases). the most common pairing with IGHV1\u201369 was IGKV3\u201320 (7 cases), followed by IGKV1\u201339 (4 cases) and IGKV1\u201333 (4 cases). structural inspection was a clash between the grafted 3 CDR-L1 and the acceptor framework's 3-typical d-e loop. the d-e loop is a framework loop of the FR3 region (residues 66\u201371 in Chothia numbering) between CDR2 and CDR3 that makes extensive contacts with CDR1. hydrophobic cluster in 3 antibodies, including the hydrophobic portion of K/N/I 66 (magenta), A71 (dark purple), and residues 5 (green) and 10 (orange) of the length 11 loops. we investigated if this clash was an artifact of the particular combination of CDR donor and acceptor framework structures. the structures of L1\u201311\u20133 CDRs are quite different from L1\u201311\u20131 and L1\u201311\u20132, with residues 5 and 10 of the CDR pointing toward each other, inwards into the VL domain core. computationally mutating A71 to Phe in antibodies results in severe steric conflicts with residues 5 and 10 of the L1 CDR. G66 of the d-e loop is completely conserved in human germline sequences, while this position the change in backbone conformation at position 66 is evident in Figures 3A and 3B. it is certainly possible that small adjustments in backbone and side-chain conformations could remove the clash shown in Figure 3A. we generated 250 decoys for each target with the Cartesian minimization protocol. the distribution of scores for C10KV3_LV1DE is a little lower than C10KV3. the 3 constructs are predicted to be more stable than the 1 and 3 variants. the redesigned VL CDR framework confers enhanced production of C10 and P2224 scFvs. increasing the culture temperature from 25 to 30 \u00b0C during expression of C10 and P2224 resulted in an apparent decrease in absolute yields. despite the differences in amino acid composition and codon usage, the redesigned KV3_LV1DE light chain was expressed and purified to approximately the same level. the presence of the 3 d-e loop in C10KV3 decreased production of the scFv by approximately 2.5 fold. the 3-based framework enhances the thermostability of these scFvs. Graph of the median derivative Tm calculated from (A) Error bars represent standard error of the mean of 4 (n = 4) (D) or 5 (n = 5) (C) independent experiments run in quadruplicate. dynode voltage was recorded to measure the heat-induced aggregation of the scFvs. increasing absorbance is caused by variations in light scattering due to increasing particle size as a result of aggregation of the unfolded protein at elevated temperature. C10 appears to lose signal at 205 nm back to baseline while gaining a more negative signal at 218 nm. both proteins are completely precipitated at 80\u00b0C (Fig. 6A) the fact that the 3 variants precipitate out of solution upon heating is not that surprising. large aggregates can be seen in both C10 and C10KV3_LV1DE preparations. this unfolding and aggregation appears to be irreversible. only large aggregates are observed when samples are cooled to 60\u00b0C. the redesigned VL framework does not reduce the ability of the C10 and P2224 CDRs to bind cell surface EGFR. previous studies showed that P2224 elicits therapeutic activity by binding to domain III of EGFR's extracellular domain. CDR grafting altered the scFv target binding by changing the orientation of the CDRs. however, this binding was better than that detected for the parental C10. this failed to bind sufficiently to allow for determination of a KD. redesigned VL framework does not reduce the ability of the C10 and P2224 CDRs to bind cell surface EGFR. both P2224 and P2224CKV3_LV1DE block cetuximab binding in equivalent concentration-dependent manners. these data demonstrate that our rational redesign of C10 and P2224 enhances protein production and thermostability without altering the antibodies' abilities to bind their target antigen. these types of data have led to incorporation of affinity maturation as a critical step in therapeutic antibody development. the authors demonstrated that switching from a VH3-V1 to a VH3-V3 dramatically improved expression levels as well as thermostability. this finding is consistent with a large body of literature focused on humanization of murine antibodies for the purpose of decreasing immunogenicity of therapeutic candidates. grafting of mu4D5 CDRs onto consensus VH3 and V1 frameworks to generate hu4D5\u20131 resulted in an 80-fold loss of binding activity. CN4 antibody consisting of variants of IMGT mouse germline V-regions IGHV2\u20136\u20137*02 (88% identity) and IGLV1*01 (97% identity) to graft the mouse anti-GCN4 CDRs onto V and VH frameworks, W\u00f6rn et al. created two mutants: one labeled -graft and one labeled -graft. the only change required to facilitate the grafting of the V3-like CDRs was the retention of the framework d-e loop. in this process, we back-mutated the d-e loop to the -like sequence found in the original C10 to produce C10KV3_LV1DE and P2224KV3_LV1DE. the 3 variants exhibit thermal unfolding that is more characteristic of the hu4D5 scFv (VH3/V1). this property is demonstrated by Bence-Jones proteins, which are over-produced light chain byproducts of multiple myeloma cells. C10's CDRs were grafted into the sequence of human 3, 3, and 1 germline sequences by replacing the CDRs with the C10 sequences. the CDR definitions of north et al.,24 are longer than the standard Chothia definitions. the CDRs of 2G75 represent the most likely conformations of H1 (H1\u201313\u201310), H2 (H2\u201310\u20131), L1 (L1\u201311\u20133), and L2 (L2\u20138\u20131). we chose PDB entry 2G7561 as the C10 wild-type template. a model of C10KV3_LV1DE was constructed by manually grafting the d-e loop from PDB entry 4GXV35 with the same sequence as the d-e loop of C10. the first step was to idealize the bond lengths and bond angles of all models with the command line: idealize.linuxgccrelease \u2013s filename.pdb. the factor C is ramped up from 0.02 to 1.0 in each round. the lowest energy structure when C=1 is saved as a decoy. the flag \"-shapovalov_lib_fixes_enable\" instructs Rosetta to use updated Ramachandran scoring functions (rama and P_aa_pp) bacterial cultures grown to OD600 = 0.8 in 2 L flasks were pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 L of 2XYT media containing 0.5 mM IPTG, 0.4 M sucrose, and 100 mg/ml carbenicillin. the soluble scFv fraction was recovered from the culture supernatant by IMAC affinity chromatography as previously described. CD spectra over the range from 195 to 250 nm were recorded on indicated scFv in 20 mM potassium phosphate at neutral pH. each scFv was analyzed at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in a 20 ml volume plated in quadruplicate. cell-bound scFv was detected with 1 mg/ml FITC-labeled Penta-His antibody (Qiagen) for 1 hour on ice. cells were washed again and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. our L2 definition is 3 residues longer than the Chothia definition on the C-terminus and our L2 definition is 2 residues longer on each end of the CDR. we built a homology model of the C10 scFv, consisting of a human IGHV1\u201369 domain and of a likely human IGLV3\u201319/IGLV1\u201344 fusion product. the grafted 2FB4 L3 backbone was left unchanged, while the grafted 2FB4 H3 was in part remodeled using the UCSF Chimera package. the grafted 2FB4 L3 backbone was left unchanged, while the grafted 2FB4 H3 was in part remodeled using the UCSF Chimera package. the RosettaAntibody models were refined in a 2-stage procedure using the program Rosetta. the first step was to idealize the bond lengths and bond angles of all models with the command line: idealize.linuxgccrelease \u2013s filename.pdb The second step was to generate 250 decoys by running the mixed dihedral-angle/Cartesian-coordinate minimization protocol. all three scFv genes were cloned into the pSyn2 bacterial expression plasmid. all three genes were cloned into the pSyn2 bacterial expression plasmid. kappa DE-loop back-graft mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. the soluble scFv fraction was recovered from the culture supernatant by IMAC affinity chromatography as previously described. initial preparations were further analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography over a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl 100 column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an AKTA Prime+ (GE Healthcare) Dynamic light scattering Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument with Dynamics V6 data analysis software. cells were washed, resuspended in FACS buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide, PBS) and plated at 2 105 cells/well in 96-well round-bottom tissue culture plates. cells were washed again and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. the data were analyzed by FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC) Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed."}
