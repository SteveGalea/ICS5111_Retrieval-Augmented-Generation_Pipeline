{"summary": "new world alphaviruses tend to be associated with encephalitic phenotypes in the affected host. Old world alphaviruses are more likely to cause arthritic outcomes. nsP1 is a membrane-anchored protein responsible for the virus. nsP3 is an 60 kDa-sized protein that can be divided into three different domains. the macrodomain is located on the N-terminus of the protein and is a highly conserved sequence of 150 amino acids. the structure of this domain consists of a six-stranded, twisting, centrally located -sheet that is surrounded by four -helices. alphavirus unique domain comprises middle third of nsP3 and is maintained only within alphaviruses. this segment contains many serine and threonine residues, forming two parallel -sheets and antiparallel -helices. nsP3 protein consists of three regions: macrodomain, alphavirus unique domain, and hypervariable domain. the macrodomain is highly conserved among all alphaviruses and contains the ADP-ribose-binding site. activity as an ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphate phosphatase activity was similar between the two viruses. studies with SFV and Hepatitis E virus show that both effectively bind poly ADP ribose. but SFV has an affinity for monomeric ADP ribose. the role of binding to poly or monomeric ADP ribose in the life cycle of the viruses is unclear. the ability of the virus to form replication complexes was greatly diminished. an increase in neuronal cell death was higher in these mutated nsP3 viruses as compared to the wild type. nsP3 interacts with G3BPs through a region on the C-terminal domain. it contains two FGDF motifs, two phenylalanine residues separated by a glycine and aspartate residue. this area was found to be conserved in multiple arthritogenic viruses. depleting G3BP1 and G3BP2 levels led to an increase in viral RNA production. in SFV infections, the G3BP proteins were also associated with the replication complex early on in infection. it has been proposed that interaction between nsP3 and Rasputin may interfere with immune responses. the binding of nsP3 to the Fragile-X proteins promoted the formation of the viral replication complex and RNA replication. inhibition of both FXR and G3BP proteins played a role in the high pathogenicity of EEEV. the SH3 domain is a non-catalytic domain that is found on numerous signaling proteins. nsP3 interacts with the same SH3-binding site as dynamin. it does so with a higher affinity (Tossavainen et al., 2016). Y-Box-Binding Protein 1 (YBX1) was shown to be associated with nsP3 of SINV. YBX1 is capable of shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. in the nucleus, it controls the transitioning of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. the association of YBX1 with NS3/4a is necessary for replication of viral RNA. the human polyomavirus JC virus makes use of YBX1 as a transcriptional activator to facilitate its survival. YBX1 has been shown to aid in cell survival during stress. sp70 and Hsp90 have been shown to play a role in the life cycle of alphaviruses through nsP3 interactions. the family consists mostly of two proteins: Hsc70 and Hsp70. it functions in aiding in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. Hsp90 has been shown to interact with the nsP3 of CHIKV to promote viral replication. inhibition of Hsp90 was shown to decrease viral RNA and protein production. Akt is activated by the binding of a tyrosine kinase receptor. Akt is then able to activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) nsP3 of SFV activated Akt directly, but only when associated with the plasma membrane. the protein activates eIF4E, a protein necessary for cap-dependent translation. eIF4E is not evident in vertebrates, as alphaviruses can inhibit host translation during infection. DDX1 is involved in the sensing of dsRNA and production of an interferon response. a knockdown of both helicases resulted in a drop in viral replication. DDX1 and DDX3 have been shown to be exploited by numerous other viruses. DDX1 promotes replication in Coronaviruses and transcription in JC virus. the IKK complex consists of the three subunits IKK, IKK, and IKK. IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory B proteins associated with the p65/p50 subunits of NFB. the NFB pathway is an often-utilized pathway for viruses, such as HTLV-1. many of these viruses differ greatly from alphaviruses in genomic makeup and life cycle. nsP3 is an important contributor to the virulence of alphaviruses. nsP3 is an important contributor to the virulence of alphaviruses. hypervariable region resulted in virulence in mice inoculated both intranasally and intramuscularly. nsP3 is tolerant of mutations, the C-terminal region, and those intolerant of mutations, the N-terminal region. more studies need to be performed to determine the exact mechanisms of interactions nsP3 has with host proteins. studies with SFV and Hepatitis E virus show that both effectively bind poly ADP ribose. but SFV has an affinity for monomeric ADP ribose. the role of binding to monomeric ADP ribose in the life cycle of the viruses is unclear. the ability of the virus to replicate was greatly diminished. an increase in neuronal cell death was higher in these mutated nsP3 viruses compared to the wild type. nsP3 interacts with G3BPs through a region on the C-terminal domain. it contains two FGDF motifs, two phenylalanine residues separated by a glycine and aspartate residue. this area was found to be conserved in multiple arthritogenic viruses. depleting G3BP1 and G3BP2 levels led to an increase in viral RNA production. in SFV infections, the G3BP proteins were also associated with the replication complex early on in infection. it has been proposed that interaction between nsP3 and Rasputin may interfere with immune responses. both proteins formed heterodimers and associated with mRNPs in the formation of stress granules. inhibition of both FXR proteins reduced the level of virus being produced. the SH3 domain is a non-catalytic domain that is found on numerous signaling proteins. nsP3 interacts with the same SH3-binding site as dynamin. it does so with a higher affinity (Tossavainen et al., 2016). Y-Box-Binding Protein 1 (YBX1) was shown to be associated with nsP3 of SINV. YBX1 is capable of shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. in the nucleus, it controls the transitioning of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. the association of YBX1 with NS3/4a is necessary for replication of viral RNA. there is an inverse correlation between the number of viral particles produced and the amount of YBX1 present. YBX1 has been shown to aid in cell survival during stress. the Hsp70 family consists mostly of two proteins: Hsc70 and Hsp70. it functions in aiding in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, transporting proteins to various organelles, and targeting proteins to lysosomes. Hsp90 has been shown to interact with the nsP3 of CHIKV to promote viral replication. inhibition of Hsp90 was shown to decrease viral RNA and protein production. PI3Ks are activated by the binding of a tyrosine kinase receptor. Akt is then able to activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway has been shown to be exploited by numerous viruses. TOR activation of 4E-BP1 activates eIF4E, a protein necessary for cap-dependent translation. alphaviruses can inhibit host translation during infection. in vitro studies using human cells, SINV suppressed PI3K-Akt-mTOR late in infection. DDX1 and DDX3 have been shown to be exploited by numerous other viruses. DDX1 promotes replication in Coronaviruses and transcription in JC virus. DDX1 acts as a co-factor for the function of Rev. the IKK complex consists of the three subunits IKK, IKK, and IKK. IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory B proteins associated with the p65/p50 subunits of NFB. IB is then tagged for ubiquitination, releasing the two subunits for nuclear transportation. nsP3 is an important contributor to the virulence of alphaviruses. nsP3 is an important contributor to the virulence of alphaviruses. many of these viruses differ greatly from alphaviruses in genomic makeup and life cycle. mutants in the hypervariable region also resulted in a virulence in mice inoculated both intranasally and intramuscularly. the use of massive parallel sequencing in VEEV has allowed for the identification of regions within the nsP3 that are tolerant of mutations."}
