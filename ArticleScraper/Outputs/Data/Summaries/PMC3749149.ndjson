{"summary": "in 2008, 206,831 Indonesian undertook the Hajj. there were 446 deaths, equivalent to 1,968 deaths per 100,000 pilgrim years. most pilgrims died in Mecca (68%) and Medinah (24%) over 2 million people from 140 countries undertook the Hajj annually, including over 200,000 people from the world's most populous Muslim majority country. extreme physical stressors such as sun exposure, heat (37\u00b0C during the day and 20\u00b0C at night), thirst, crowding, steep inclines and traffic congestions increase health risks. the mortality rate of Indonesian pilgrims fluctuated between 200\u2013380 deaths per 100,000 persons during the ten-week Hajj period. data collected were limited to basic demographic characteristics and general cause of death. cause of death could only be obtained from the hospital death certificate or flight doctor\u2019s records if a death occurred in the community. but they lacked detailed information about the cause of death. the majority of pilgrims, anecdotally reported to be 95%, joined one of the government-sponsored Hajj pilgrimage travel services. the rest joined private more expensive pilgrimage travel services that are of shorter duration (25 days) each pilgrim was required to visit a government healthcare facility for a medical check-up. verbal autopsy form was developed based on the standards established by WHO. it obtained detailed information about medical history, signs and symptoms. the verbal autopsy form aimed to increase the specificity of the cause of death by elucidating medical history and recent events. the majority of pilgrims, anecdotally reported to be 95%, joined one of the government-sponsored Hajj pilgrimage travel services that include 40 days of travel. the rest joined private more expensive pilgrimage travel services that are shorter duration (25 days) verbal autopsy form was developed based on the standards established by WHO. it obtained detailed information about medical history, signs and symptoms, and other circumstances regarding the death from family or friends who travelled with the deceased. 28% of pilgrims were classified as high risk due to underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, other chronic diseases or if they were 60 years or older. n pilgrims were aged 18 years or more, where the majority were female (55%, Table 1). jeddah Medinah Mecca Arafah-Mina Mecca Jeddah, or jeddah mecca arafah-Mina Mecca Medinah Jeddah. duration of travel for pilgrims on either route was 40 days, of which 22 days were spent in Mecca, 5\u20136 days in Arafah-Mina, 8\u20139 days in Medinah and 1\u20132 days in transit in Jeddah. most deaths occurred in mecca (n=305, 68%), followed by Medinah (n=106, 24%) and Jeddah (n=35, 8%). most (77%) deaths occurred during pilgrims\u2019 active hours between 5am and 9pm. mortality rates were higher in the afternoon (possibly due to the heat) and early morning. there was no statistical difference in the number of deaths occurring for pilgrims undertaking Route 1 (200 out of 93,357 pilgrims) compared to those on Route 2 (231 out of 113,474, p=0.72). cause of death Most deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases (Table 3). 38 of the 446 (9%) pilgrims who died had body mass index 27.5 indicating obesity for Asian body types [16] 50 Communicable diseases 2 (0.4) 8 (2) 0.030 Metabolic diseases 2 (0.5) 1 Mental disturbance 0 5 (1) 0.063 Other 6 (1) 12 (3) 0.15 Ill-defined/unspecified 0 43 (10) 0.001 Total 446 446 Indonesian pilgrims for the Hajj in 2008 All 206,831 Indonesian pilgrims were aged 18 years or more, where the majority (59%) were aged between 41 and 59 years. total for the three groups = 28,200,000.
