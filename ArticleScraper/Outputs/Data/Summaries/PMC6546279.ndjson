{"summary": "Vampire myths are among the oldest monster stories extant, finding origins in ancient Persian and Babylonian stories of blood-sucking demons and biblical references to Lilith, the \u201cnight creature.\u201d 6,7 The myth of the succubus was echoed in Greek and Roman literature and was later expanded during medieval times. syphilis was seen as a european health crisis of the first order. in the late 1800s, syphilis was seen as a european health crisis of the first order. in the late 1800s, syphilis was seen as a european health crisis of the first order. resemblance to a victim of congenital syphilis cannot be ignored. the resemblance to a victim of congenital syphilis cannot be ignored. some of the more recent vampire offerings suggest variations on the themes of contagion and control central to Dracula. lycanthropy, or the capability of transforming into a wolf, has a world-wide and ancient history. this condition was often depicted as the consequence of a spell, not a bite or sexual exposure, and in some cultures was considered a special gift, not a curse. vampires and werewolves represent external threats that frighten us with their long fangs and claws. parasitism is a theme that has been thoroughly explored in horror fiction and in movies. rabid stretched the premise of rabies with an interesting amalgam of infectious illness and body dysmorphism. the Alien (1979) movie, its sequels, and its prequel Prometheus (2012) presented one of the most memorable modern examples of parasitic terror. similarities with actual human parasitoses, such as myiasis and dracunculosis, are readily apparent. the pandemic has turned most of humankind into vampiric beings, violent and phobic of sunlight. the microbial aspect becomes explicit in the fertile branch of horror depicting highly fatal pandemics. great works of both non-fiction and fiction have come out of tragedies of pandemics like the Black Death of the 1300s. book and movie depictions of killer pathogens prior to the 1970s tended to feature the pestilence as a backdrop or a catalyst, not a focal point. most compelling were the scenes of scientists and physicians donning bioprotective equipment that would not look out of place in hospitals treating recent SARS and Ebola outbreaks. the disease itself (once TB, cancer today) arouses thoroughly old-fashioned kinds of dread. as a microprocess, it is described as cancer is: an invasion. an older metaphor, reminiscent of syphilis, is invoked: pollution. horror in fiction and film has been much debated over the years. horror reflects the age in which it was created. it serves as a metaphorical tool for writers and artists to come to terms with dark forces and cataclysmic events. the horrors of two world wars followed by the first nuclear cataclysms have led to the realization that untoward events could triumph over technology and civilization. the systems for control have proven inadequate to the challenges of the modern era. horror seems likely to continue to make up a fertile portion of our literature. infectious elements will almost certainly be prominent."}
