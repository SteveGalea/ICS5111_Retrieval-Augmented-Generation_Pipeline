{"summary": "early-warning signals (EWS) are summary statistics (e.g. the variance and autocorrelation) which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. a major obstacle to deploying early-warning systems is the type of data available to calculate the EWS. snapshots data cannot be reconstructed from case report data. underreporting may occur due to asymptomatic infection, poorly implemented notification protocols, or socio-political factors. clerical errors can result in both under- and over-reporting. three time series for the same simulated outbreak are shown. daily snapshots of the number of infected (black line), weekly aggregated case reports with no reporting error (perfect reporting, blue line) and weekly aggregated case reports with reporting error (imperfect reporting, red line) reports are modeled using a negative binomial distribution with = 0.25 and = 0.1. we simulated a stochastic SIR model of a pathogen emerging via increasing R0. we corrupted the simulated case reports by applying a negative binomial reporting error. we find that performance depends on both the EWS and the reporting model. the number of recovery events (at rate It) within each aggregation period are included in the model as an additional variable.

AUC = 0.5 implies that an observed rank coefficient value conveys no information about whether or not a disease is approaching an epidemic transition. a larger |AUC 0.5| implies better performance, if |AUC 0.5| = 0.5 the rank coefficient value classifies the scenarios perfectly. b - 1, (3) where is the size of one time step. normalization factor 2b 1 is reduced to ensure it remains equal to the number of data points within the window. some EWS depend on others, for example the variance depends on the mean. the null model assumes no change in host-to-host transmissibility. transmission dynamics were simulated using the Gillespie algorithm. for the null model, transmission is simulated for 20 years. the model compartments and parameters are listed in Table 1. Transition rates and effects are listed in Table 2. The basic reproductive number for the SIR model is R0(t) = (t)/(+ ). t varies due to nondescript secular trends in the transmissibility. the ten candidate EWS considered in this paper are listed in Table 3. the index of dispersion is a similar measure to the coefficient of variation. as R0 approaches 1, the mean number of cases caused by introductions rises. as R0 approaches 1, we investigate the performance of two higher-order moments, the skewness and kurtosis. we also investigate the performance of two higher-order moments, the skewness and kurtosis. Kurtosis Kurt t = 1 t 4 s = t - ( b - 1 ) t + ( b - 1 ) + Autocovariance ACovt() = E[(Xt t)(Xt t)] ACov t = s = t - ( b - 1 ) t + ( b - 1 ) 2 e - ( 1 - R 0 ) + Auto BDI theory predicts most EWS are expected to grow hyperbolically as R0 approaches one. the autocorrelation is expected to grow exponentially, the kurtosis quadratically and the skewness linearly. the coefficient of variation is the only EWS which does not grow, instead remaining constant. a coefficient close to (+/)1 implies consistent increases/decreases of the EWS in time. multiple simulations of the test (emerging) and null scenarios result in two distributions of correlation coefficients for each EWS. if the AUC 0.5 then a decreasing trend in the EWS indicates emergence. if AUC > 0.5 an increasing trend indicates emergence. a larger |AUC 0.5| implies better performance. results have been found to be similar for a bandwidth of b = 35 time steps. the experimental design is fully factorial (i.e. considers all parameter value combinations) for the null model, the disease emerges over T = 20 years. a constant rate, R0 = 0. enables clearer identification of responses to reporting process effects. results span the full range of the AUC statistic. results are shown for 1/ = 1 week and 1 month. in a fully susceptible population, on average 1 susceptible individual per week acquires the infection from external sources. individuals have a mean lifespan of 70 years. the average population size N = 106 individuals. coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis Provided the data are aggregated monthly. the coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis have similar AUC values when calculated from snapshots data with 1/ = 1 week. with reporting, if = 1, = 100 the AUC = 0.005 (Fig 6). all three EWS perform well (AUC > 0.77) regardless of infectious and aggregation periods. performance is comparable with snapshots data (Fig 4). at low reporting probabilities the index of dispersion performs best if 1/ = 1 week and = 1 month. this drop occurs at a reporting probability dependent on the infectious period and aggregation period, around = 0.047 for = 1 week, and around = 0.027 for = 1/ = 1 month. overall performance is best if 1/ = 1 week and = 1 month. if calculated from snapshots data, the coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness are the worst performing statistics. skewness and kurtosis (both decreasing) are opposite those given by the BDI process (both increasing) the improvement in performance at low reporting probability is acutely sensitive to other model parameters. both overdispersion in the reporting and larger aggregation period severely dampen the sensitivity to. all three EWS perform poorly if = 0.01, regardless of other model parameters. the mean and variance have AUC > 0.85, and the first differenced variance has AUC 0.66, but is largely unaffected by reporting probability and infectious period. the index of dispersion has a similar performance to the previous group of EWS, however with certain differences. unless the overdispersion in the observation process is high ( = 0.01) they outperform the autocorrelation, autocovariance, decay time and index of dispersion. at low reporting probabilities they outperform the autocorrelation, autocovariance, decay time and index of dispersion. the coefficient of variation, kurtosis and skewness perform poorly as EWS. in general, the other EWS performed well and are strong candidates for incorporation in monitoring systems intended to provide early warning of disease emergence. ness for this distribution are 1/2 = (1R0)/1/2 and the kurtosis is 1 = ()1(1 R0) these two expressions decrease as R0 increases from 0 to 1. the improved performance at low is a consequence of the increased stochasticity in reporting outweighing demographic stochasticity. the resulting time series is highly volatile, with little similarity in appearance to the underlying time series of actual cases. it is unlikely that case reports for an emerging disease will have such high overdispersion. however, high reporting is not essential for reliable early warning. we expect that these three EWS will work best for pathogens with short serial intervals. for pathogens with extremely long serial intervals reliable use of these EWS is unlikely. the purpose of this study was not to identify the best EWS, but to investigate the robustness of this approach. the reporting error of case reports with differing case identification criteria is expected to be very different. cross-validating EWS calculated from each data stream could improve performance. our findings further reinforce the hypothesis that disease emergence is preceded by detectable EWS. for both models T = 10 years and bandwidth b = 36.
