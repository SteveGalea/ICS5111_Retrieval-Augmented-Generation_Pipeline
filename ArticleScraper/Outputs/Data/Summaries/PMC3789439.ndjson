{"summary": "the world health organization reported 622 human cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection from 2003 to 2013. the most effective preventive measure against the virus is vaccination. the invasive plant Eupatorium adenophorum has a strong ability to adapt to different environments all over the world. many bioactive components isolated from E. adenophorum have shown antimicrobial activity and immunomodulating properties. there have been few reports addressing the bioactivity of E. adenophorum polysaccharide (EAP) animal and cells 8\u201310-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) the original breeding pairs were purchased from Charles River (Beijing, China) mice were raised in independent ventilated cages and received pathogen-free food and water. the final liquid was mixed with 95% ethanol (v/v) and centrifuged at 3000 g/min for 10 min. the precipitates were successively washed with absolute ethanol, ether, and dried under vacuum at 40\u00b0C. EAP content was determined by the phenol-H2SO4 method. 2.6. Plaque Assay MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 60\u201372 h and stained with 1% crystal violet. qPCR was performed for other eight genes: h-actin, h IL-6, h IFN-, and hTNF- for A549 cells. m-actin, mTLR-2, mTLR-4, mDectin-1, mMR, mIL-6, mIFN-, and mTNF- for Raw264.7 cells. ELISA IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels in lung were tested with ELISA kits. one gram of lung tissue from each mouse was ground in 1 mL PBS and centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm. sections at 5-m-thick were obtained after embedding in paraffin. each slide was examined by light microscopy (Olympus CX31, Center Valley, PA, USA) each slide was examined by light microscopy. the leaves were sliced and dried in shade. 100 g dried materials were powdered in a mixer and then filtered with 40 meshes. leaf powder was extracted by ultrasonic treatment with 1000 mL of distilled water for 45 min. controls were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were collected 36 h after treatment for RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) mice were administered PBS at a dose of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg body weight. the expression of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H5N1 influenza virus was detected by qPCR using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit. the reaction was run on an ABI 7500 thermal cycler with an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s.

IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- expression at day 3 postinfection levels were determined by qPCR. TNF- mRNA levels following EAP (25 mg/kg) treatment were significantly lower. in the lung were correlated; suggesting that EAP treatment reduces lung lesions in H5N1 infected mice. the solid arrows indicate interstitial edema and inflammatory cellular infiltration around small blood vessels. mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- were detected by qPCR. mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- in a dose-dependent manner in a549 and Raw264.7 cells. mice were treated with EAP at a dose of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg body weight intranasally once daily for 5 days prior to viral challenge with 120 PFU. all mice receiving PBS died at day 11. all mice receiving PBS died at day 11. the protective effect of EAP against H5N1 virus is likely due to its immunomodulatory properties. lungs of five mice per group were collected at day 0 before infection. the mRNA levels in the EAP group were significantly higher than those in the PBS control (naive mice) histopathological Lesions in Lungs Excessive inflammation can cause severe lung lesions during H5N1 influenza infection. tissues of each group at day 3 postinfection were examined. the lungs of EAP (25 mg/kg) treated mice showed milder lesions than those receiving PBS. to determine which receptor contributes directly to the innate immune recognition of EAP, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, Dectin-1, and mannose receptor (MR) were examined by qPCR both in vivo and in vitro. the expression of Dectin-1 and MR in EAP treated mice was significantly elevated compared with controls. the anti-H5N1 effect of EAP was very likely due to the innate immune recognition of EAP and the secretion of innate immune mediators (IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-) before infection. the effect of EAP on PRR expression was determined both in vivo and in vitro. high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected during H5N1 infection [23, 24] this \u201ccytokine storm\u201d leads to the severe respiratory symptoms and host immune injury. the lack of proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF- and IL-6) facilitates viral clearance. antiinfluenza properties of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- have been discussed in many studies, despite their participation in cytokine storms triggered by influenza infection. IL-6 plays an important role in protecting against influenza A virus as it is required for viral clearance. the protection against H5N1 by EAP treatment is less likely to cause drug resistance. treatment with EAP effectively inhibits H5N1 viral replication and improves animal survival."}
