{"summary": "a number of closely related viral genomes have been sequenced. many have been deposited in geneBank without annotations. the program is freely available under the General Public License. genomes of multiple virus isolates have become relatively easy to sequence. a large number of genomes submitted to GenBank lack annotations. the subsequent annotation of these genomes by multiple researchers is a tedious and time-consuming process. GATU has been designed to fill a gap in the currently available software repertoire. it does not require the two input genomes to be aligned. it does not require the target and reference genomes to be aligned. it is intended to address the problem database curators face in attempting to annotate large number of closely related genomes. GATU consists of two distinct components. the first is a Java Swing-based GUI that allows the user to select the reference and target genomes, initiate automatic transfer of annotations, view and evaluate the results, and finally select the ORFs to be annotated. the second is an application server, which runs programs such as BLAST [5], NEEDLE [6,7], and CLUSTALW [8] on a remote server and then returns the results to the client machine. the client system sends a request to the Application Server to run a specific program (such as BLAST) the application server then runs the program using the client's input and subsequently passes the output of the program back to the client machine. this optimizes speed, reduces the RAM required for the client machine, and reduces the problems associated with cross-platform support. exons in the reference genome that lack either a start or a stop codon are excluded from this process, along with mature peptides. the region found in this manner is translated into a peptide sequence; NEEDLE then generates a global alignment between this translated sequence and the corresponding protein from the reference genome. GATU was implemented in Java to allow its use with multiple operating systems. users simply launch the application from a web page using Java Web Start. if an updated version of the program has been released, this version is automatically downloaded upon starting the program. the user may choose not to use our application server and run BLAST, NEEDLE and CLUSTALW on the local machine if the appropriate programs are installed on that machine. the GUI consists of five sections within a main window: 1) a menu bar that provides access to Help texts, Preference settings, etc.; 3) a genome selector with which the user chooses the reference and target genomes. the first step is to use each ORF in the reference genome as a query to search the target genome. GATU runs the following searches: TBLASTN for intron-less genes and mature peptides. the user may enter the minimum required length for these ORFs. all those that have not already been matched to a reference genome ORF are displayed as unassigned-ORFs. BLAST searches of the unassigned-ORFs against the NCBI database can be run automatically or manually. the automated process took less than 15 min to complete, with no user intervention required during this time. if a BLAST search is also performed against the NCBI nr database for each ORF, the running time will be substantially longer. we routinely run these searches interactively since only a small fraction of the ORFs require them. GATU found and automatically accepted target sequence counterparts of 146 of the 148 genes (genes 1\u2013147 and gene 101a) present in the reference genome. the accepted ORFs were 99.1\u2013100% similar (predicted amino acid sequence) to the reference genes and 127 were 100% similar. this also indicates that the start/stop positions of the reference and target genes matched. the user can now make an informed decision on whether this putative ORF should be included in the target genome annotations. it is likely that protein translation of this mRNA would begin at the same position as in the reference genome. the annotation could be accepted with the FRAG designation. the user can view the results of pre-run BLAST searches for the unassigned-ORFs. right-clicking on any of the unassigned-ORFs and selecting the appropriate option allows the user to view the results of pre-run BLAST searches for the ORF. the user can run BLAST searches if the Manual BLAST search option was checked during the initial annotation run. GATU can only match a reference gene to the first BLAST hit that is found. we have tested GATU on bacterial genomes up to ten times the size of a typical poxvirus genome. of the 1112 annotated genes, 817 were 100% similar (global alignment with NEEDLE) the GenBank file for this genome contains 1116 genes and gene fragments (NC_005043) in comparison, the GenBank file for this genome contains 1113 annotations (NC_005043) in addition, our annotation performed with GATU added several annotations to the target that were not in its GenBank file. using GATU and the annotated GSS1 GenBank file (NC_002689) showed 100 differences. a large fraction of the total bacterial ORFs were automatically annotated correctly by GATU. the majority of the \"missed\" ORFs were small (150 nt) hypothetical genes that were either not annotated in the reference genome. views in these panels can be modified in the Preferences. clicking on a row in the table (containing an accepted annotation) will automatically highlight this annotation in the graphical view. the Jump button moves the graphical display to center the ORF in the window. a global alignment of the reference protein and its putative counterpart on the target genome can be obtained by clicking on the Needle Alignment button. the needle alignment shows that the ORF in the target genome is truncated at the N-terminus but contains the remaining 240 aa encoded by the reference genome. this global alignment provides a useful indication as to the level of similarity between the two ORFs. the user can select this by clicking in the relevant row of the Genetype column. results of TBLASTN search with an unassigned-ORF; display is presented in the main GATU window. the user can select this by clicking in the relevant row of the Genetype column. GATU correctly transferred and automatically accepted annotation for 146 of 148 genes from the reference sheeppox genome to the target genome. the missing genes encode a protein of only 36 aa and were subsequently detected by a TBLASTN search of the target genome. 145 genes were 95\u201399% similar, 28 genes were 90\u201394% similar, 22 genes were 85\u201389% similar, 16 genes were 80\u201384% similar, 11 genes were 75\u201379% similar, 14 genes were 70\u201374% similar and 59 genes were 70% similar. this information is available from the Statistics menu within GATU. test using bacterial genomes used two different species from the Thermoplasma genus. the reference genome GenBank file contained 1482 annotated genes. 1103annotations (74%) were accepted automatically into the target genome annotation. GATU significantly reduces the annotation workload by automatically transferring over 90% of the annotations from a reference genome to the target. GATU was designed for use with viral genomes but as demonstrated here, GATU is also useful for annotation of bacterial genomes. the annotations are compared to genes of C. pneumoniae TW183 found in the GenBank file (NC_005043).
