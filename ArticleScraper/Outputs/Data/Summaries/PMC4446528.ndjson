{"summary": "current methods for comparative genomic analysis based on the detection of homologous sequences allow the determination of the time of divergence between taxa. current methods for comparative genomic analysis based on the detection of homologous regions are limited to genomic sequences with detectable homologous regions. the failure to detect such regions prevents the application of virtually any HD method. HI metrics can be easily calculated for virtually any fragment of any genome. these metrics usually detect biases by comparing the observed frequencies of nucleotide words, especially dinucleotide and codons, with expected frequencies for the same words. the dinucleotide usage patterns in a given genome are commonly referred in the scientific literature as genomic signatures. a final broad class of factors known to influence the use of nucleotide words in genomes is the occurrence of neutral processes such as genetic drift during the course of evolution. if properly modeled and interpreted, the results obtained through HI metrics in comparative genomic studies can highlight broad patterns of mutational and selective forces as well as random variations acting in the genomes under analysis. HI metrics are a robust option to develop procedures to classify nucleotide sequences to taxonomic units. some of them generate results that contain phylogenetic signal. the patterns of DOR and codon usage bias in complete genomes of prokaryotes present a strong correlation with phylogenetic trees. several nucleotide motifs interact with the transcription/translation machinery. a selection pressure particularly strong in single-celled organisms. a final broad class of factors known to influence the use of nucleotide words in genomes is the occurrence of neutral processes such as genetic drift during course of evolution. HI metrics are a robust option to develop procedures to classify nucleotide sequences to taxonomic units. the patterns of DOR and codon usage bias in complete genomes of prokaryotes present a strong correlation with phylogenetic trees of 16S ribosomal RNA. the simplest known HI metric used as genomic signature is the GC content of genomic sequences. GC presents a huge variation across genomes ranging from approximately 20% in Plasmodium falciparum [25] to 70% in some actinobacteria [26]. GC content is reasonably constant within a given genome, and was already found to be correlated with several universal factors of microbial lifestyles. fx and fy denote the frequency of mononucleotides x and y in a given sequence. fxy denotes the observed frequency of dinucleotide xy in the same sequence. the calculation is valid only for single-stranded sequences that do not obey the first Chargaff's parity rule. codon for the ith amino acid, and expected values are calculated by counting the total of codons encoding the amino acid i in a given sequence divided by the degeneracy class of amino acid i. expected values are calculated by counting all synonymous codons coding for amino acid i in a sequence divided by the number of synonymous codons that code for this amino acid. effective number of codons (NC) is calculated for coding regions. it represents the overall bias of preferential use of synonyms codons in a given gene/genome. the equation to calculate NC is conceptually similar to the calculation of the effective population size used in population genetics. nRC \u2014 number of amino acids in a degeneracy class; RC \u2014 set of all amino acids belonging to a degeneracy class. each value corresponds to an average value (r) calculated for each amino acid degeneracy class (two, three, four and six) fGC3S parameter ranging from zero to one generates the theoretical curve of NC plot. a new metric, conceptually similar to NC, takes into account GC content. however, bias evidenced by NC\u2032 must be interpreted excluding GC content as a possible source of variation. a k n a 1.

(5) and (6). otide is defined as the product of the observed frequencies of its nucleotides. values significantly above or below one indicate the presence of mutational and/or selection bias actively shaping the frequency of dinucleotides. arbitrary cutoff, DOR values observed outside the range of 0.78\u20131.25 are commonly considered to have low or high relative abundance. fx and fy denote any two nucleotides, and fz and fw denote the frequencies of nucleotides z and w, complementary to y and x respectively. observed values are the counts of the jth codon for the ith amino acid. expected values are calculated by counting the total of codons encoding the amino acid i in a given sequence divided by the degeneracy class of amino acid i HI metrics due to the immediate biological relevance of words of these lengths for pivotal biological processes involving nucleic acids. using longer DNA words as genomic signatures adds more dimensions to compare and stratify sequence data. the length increase arguably improves classification performance of genomic signatures metrics [32\u201335] arbitrary cutoff, DOR values observed outside the range of 0.78\u20131.25 are commonly considered to have low or high relative abundance. fx and fy denote the frequency of mononucleotides x and y in a given sequence. fx and fy denote any two nucleotides, and fz and fw denote the frequencies of nucleotides z and w, complementary to y and x. observed values are the counts of the jth codon for the ith amino acid, and expected values are calculated by counting the total of codons encoding the amino acid i in a given sequence divided by the degeneracy class of amino acid i. effective number of codons (NC) is calculated for coding regions and represents the overall bias of preferential use of synonyms codons in a given gene/genome. the equation to calculate NC is conceptually similar to the calculation of the effective population size used in population genetics. na \u2014 number of codons for amino acid a (amino acid degeneracy class); na \u2014 observed number of codons for amino acid a (only for amino acids with degeneracy class greater than one) nRC \u2014 number of amino acids in a degeneracy class; RC \u2014 set of all amino acids belonging to a degeneracy class. a new metric uses the chi-square test (X2) to calculate the deviation of observed frequencies of use of each codon i (pi, Eq. (8)) when compared with expected values (ei) the expected deviation value for each amino acid (X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X. X a 2 = i = 1 k n a p i e i 2 e i.

(8)) when compared with expected values (ei) Expected values may be calculated in various ways, such as from the frequencies of mono, di or trinucleotides comprising the codon, therefore accounting for distinct null model scenarios. several pipelines for classification of sequences from environmental genomics to taxonomic space rely on HI metrics. other classification methods could be used to detect subsequences with biased distribution of HI metrics within longer genomic sequences. HI metrics are sometimes the only class of tools available to study how these genomes evolved such large repertories of ORFans. HI metrics have also been used to detect coevolutionary trends in a virus-host biological system. the genomes of such disparate organisms coexist in the same cellular space. it is reasonable to assume viral and host genomes share some common compositional features due to constraints induced by host factors. phylogenetically related Flaviviridae viruses are under very distinct lineage-specific constraints. evidencing lineage-specific coevolutionary processes between viral and host genomes that could not be surveyed using HD metrics. HI metrics are better described as homology-independent metrics for comparative genomics. use of HI metrics as tools for comparative genomic analysis can reveal important pieces of biological information in genomic sequences without priorhomology inference."}
