{"summary": "statins have a low frequency of side effects including hepatotoxicity, myotoxicity, and proteinuria2,3. most cases were associated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin. interstitial lung disease secondary to rosuvastatin is rare7,8. acetyl-L-carnitine, 500 mg, once daily for 48 days prior to this hospitalization; cilostazol, 100 mg, twice daily; and rosuvastatin, 5 mg, once daily for 27 days prior to this hospitalization. he developed a fever and cough 3 days prior to this hospital visit. bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. no endobronchial lesions revealed with bronchoscopy. microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction of bronchoscopic wash specimens were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumococcus and respiratory virus. urine antigen and immunologic study were performed to exclude others pathogen. a computed tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse ill-defined ground glass opacity with septal line thickening in bilateral lung fields. rosuvastatin was strongly suspected as the cause of the patient's DILD. steroid therapy (prednisolone, 1 mg/kg of body weight) was initiated. rosuvastatin-induced interstitial pneumonitis has been rarely reported. a definite mechanism for SILI is not yet known. some authors proposed that the potential toxicity mechanism might be mediated by intracellular lipid metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism, and immunologic response. the patient was the first diagnosed with rosuvastatin-induced interstitial lung disease in Korea. a foamy macrophage appearance could help in the diagnosis of SILI, coupled with the clinical symptoms and radiologic findings."}
