{"summary": "a total of one million severe, acute, lower respiratory infections may be attributable annually to influenza-associated infections in children younger than 5 years. influenza viruses are recognized as risk factors for secondary bacterial infections or co-colonizations. detection of influenza viruses in upper respiratory samples from children with pneumonia might be related to one of these phenomena. study clinicians at each participating site assessed for eligibility. clinical characteristics, medical history, vital signs, clinical symptoms, and biological parameters were recorded prospectively for each patient on a standardized data collection form. 86 influenza-related pneumonia cases were observed among 888 pneumonia children analyzed. influenza proportion in less than 5-year-old children with pneumonia was 9.7% (95% CI: 7.9\u201311.8%) in Cambodia and 6.2% (95% CI: 2.3\u201313.3%) in Madagascar. it ranged from 0% (95% CI: 0\u201310.1%) in Madagascar to 23.7% (95% CI: 2.2\u201339.0%) in India in the 12- to 23-month-old group. between 3.5% (95% CI: 0.2\u201315.8%) in paraguay and 21.9% (95% CI: 10.1\u201338.5%) in Haiti in the 24- to 60-month-old group. weight, kg, median (IQR) 9 (7.2\u201310.5) 9 (7\u201311) 0.86 Height, cm, median (IQR) 80 (73\u201387) 77 (66.3\u201388) 0.074 Body mass index, median (IQR) 14.9 (13.5\u201315.8) 15.1 (13.6\u201317.0) 0.20 Mid-upper arm circumference, median (IQR) 14 (13\u201315.5) 14 (12\u201316) 0.72 Weight-for-height Z-score 2 SD 16 median (IQR) 5 (4\u20138) 5 (3\u20137) 0.21 Vital signs at admission Temperature, \u00b0C, median (IQR) 38.5 (37.6\u201338.9) 38.3 (37.7\u201338.8) 0.74 Breathing rate, cycles/minute, median (IQR) 55 (48\u201360) 54 (46\u201360) 0.81 Cardiac rate, beats/minute, median (IQR) 136 (120\u2013152) 136 (121\u2013152) 0. titis 1/75 (1.3) 9/634 (1.4) 0.95 Conjunctivitis 0/86 (0.0) 15/799 (1.9) 0.57 Inability to drink 13/86 (15.1) 99/797 (12.4) 0.48 Vomiting 17/86 (19.8) 153/798 (19.2) 0.89 Diarrhea 14/86 (16.3) 113/800 (14.1) 0.59 H1N1 vaccination in 2009 3/52 (5.8) 17/480 (3.5) 0. in the 2- to 11-month-old and 12- to 23-month-old age groups, few significant differences in characteristics were observed. wheezing, diminished breathing sounds, and rhonchi were identified less frequently in influenza-related pneumonia cases compared with pneumonia cases without identified influenza viruses. viral coinfections were observed in 46/86 (53.5%) of the influenza-related pneumonia group and viral\u2013bacterial coinfection/co-colonizations in 61/86 (70.9%) RT-PCR assay was frequently more positive for S. pneumoniae in the influenza-related pneumonia group (13/66 [19.7%] versus 61/645 [9.5%], P = 0.018) association was negative for other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus) syncytial virus 9/86 (10.5) 169/802 (21.1) 0.022 Rhinovirus 5/86 (5.8) 216/802 (26.8) 0.001 Viral coinfection/co-colonization 46/86 (53.5) 172/802 (21.5) 0.001 Bacteria detected in respiratory samples S. pneumoniae 58/86 (67.4) 547/801 (68.3) 0.90 S. aureus 10/86 (11.6) 97/801 no relevant characteristics were associated with influenza-related pneumonia cases in the 2- to 11-month-old and 12- to 23-month-old age groups. in the 24- to 60-month-old age group, lower WBC and neutrophil counts might support a viral etiology of pneumonia. influenza viruses are frequent in respiratory samples from children with pneumonia in developing and emerging countries with moderate heterogeneity between them. proportions of S. pneumoniae identified in respiratory samples were also higher in influenza-related pneumonia cases compared with pneumonia cases without influenza detection (67.4% versus 35%)."}
