{"summary": "a single-stranded DNA virus in the family Circoviridae contributes to a group of syndromes collectively termed porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) (1). two important clinical syndromes associated with PCVAD are PCV2-associated pneumonia and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) pigs with or without prior vaccination with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) the results demonstrate the protective properties of vaccination; however, the short-term benefit is outweighed by the longer-term impact of MLV on PCVAD. all pigs were housed in two environmentally controlled rooms at the Kansas State University Large Animal Research Center. rooms were chemically disinfected, cleaned with a high-heat pressure washer, and gas decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide prior to use. 115 pigs in one room were vaccinated with a commercial PRRS MLV vaccine. 11 pigs showed clinical signs of PCVAD and 7 pigs not showing such signs were humanely euthanized. they were selected on the basis of clinical disease without regard to vaccine status. the PRRSV and PCV2b isolates were originally derived from the lymph node of a pig with severe PMWS. the virus was serially diluted 1:10 in minimal essential medium (MEM; Corning) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin-streptomycin (Pen Strep; 80 U/ml and 80 g/ml, respectively; Gibco), 3 g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone) and 25 mM HEPES. the dilutions were then added the TCID50 per milliliter was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (18). the challenge viruses were recombined to yield a 2-ml dose consisting of 103.6 TCID50 PCV2 and 105 TCID50 PRRSV in MEM. each pig was visually examined by a veterinarian or veterinary assistant each day during the study period. ic treatments unrelated to PRRSV or PCVAD were documented. animals were humanely euthanized with pentobarbital sodium. pigs that died or were humanely euthanized due to circumstances unrelated to the effects of coinfection were excluded from the mortality analysis. hematoxylin and eosin were evaluated by a blinded board-certified pathologist. the final score assigned to each pig was an average from two separate evaluations by the same pathologist. PRRS viral RNA was quantified by using EZ-PRRSV MPX 4.0 real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) target-specific reagents. each plate contained Tetracore quantification standards and control sets. plasmid DNA 1:1,000 in nuclease-free water followed by five serial 1:10 dilutions in nuclease-free water. standard curves were run in duplicate with nuclease-free water as a negative control. the melting curve was performed between 65 and 95\u00b0C using 0.5\u00b0C increments. 2,500 antigen-coated beads were placed in each well of a 96-well round-bottom polystyrene plate. the plate was wrapped in foil and washed three times with 190 l of PBS-GS. the microspheres were resuspended in 100 l of PBS-GS. a logistic mixed model was used to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the binary traits of blue ear, veterinary treatment for PCVAD, and mortality. the model included the design effects of vaccination, WUR, and the interaction between vaccination and WUR, with initial body weight as a covariate. the population used in this study was composed of pigs with two genotypes. 50% had WUR genotype AA, and 50% had AB or BB. both the vaccine group and nonvaccine group were balanced according to WUR genotype. all pigs in both rooms were challenged with a combination of PRRSV and PCV2b. individual body weights were determined on days 3, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70 postvaccination. at 11 dpi, 10 vaccinated and 10 nonvaccinated pigs were randomly selected for humane euthanasia. the suspension was heat treated at 55\u00b0C for 30 min to remove PRRSV, bacteria, and other heat-labile agents. a combination lung/lymph node homogenate was prepared from the CD/CD pigs. the preparation was negative for most heat-stable agents, such as parvovirus, but still positive for torque teno sus virus. s of the PCV2 challenge stock were plated in quadruplicate into rapidly dividing ST cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate (BD Falcon) the cells were fixed, permeabilized with 80% acetone, and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled porcine anti-PCV (Veterinary Medical Research and Development, Inc.) all pigs with overt clinical disease and rectal temperatures of 104\u00b0F were administered flunixin meglumine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) pigs with intractable fevers of >4 days' duration were given a 2-day washout period and were then administered oral meloxicam. the evaluator was blinded to the sources of the lung pictures. slides-mounted tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. a rabbit anti-PCV2 antibody (Iowa State University) was diluted 1:500 in Bond primary antibody diluent (Leica Biosystems) the complex was visualized using Fast Red chromogen (Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection kit; Leica Biosystems) nuclease-free water was used to bring the master mix volume to 18 l per reaction. the addition of 2 l of template nucleic acid brought the final reaction volume to 20 l. bacteria were grown in LB broth plus ampicillin. protein expression was induced with isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. protein was purified using the USB PrepEase histidine-tagged protein purification kit. microspheres were resuspended in 100 l of PBS-GS. a logistic mixed model was used to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the binary traits of blue ear, veterinary treatment for PCVAD, and mortality. all analyses were performed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. comparisons of average daily gain, viremia, and antibody response were performed using the unpaired t test. RESULTS PRRSV viremia is decreased after PRRS vaccination, but PCV2 viremia is increased. PRRSV and PCV2 viremia in vaccinated and nonvaccinated pigs were reduced by >1 log unit from that for nonvaccinated pigs. the results demonstrated that vaccination was effective in reducing PRRS viremia in a heterologous challenge model. no clinical signs were apparent in either the vaccinated or nonvaccinated group. the first was a PRRSV-associated syndrome, aural cyanosis. blue ear is not pathognomonic for PRRS, but often coincides with acute infection. panel A shows the percentage of pigs with aural cyanosis. primary clinical sign associated with acute PRRSV infection is respiratory disease resulting from interstitial pneumonia. pigs were removed from 20 euthanized pigs (10 pigs from each group) lesions typical of PCVAD were found by gross anatomical and microscopic examinations of lungs and lymph nodes from pigs that died or were euthanized. pigs showed multifocal to diffuse interstitial pneumonia with mottling of lung tissue, hemorrhage, and consolidation. the number of pigs undergoing treatment as a result of PCVAD-associated clinical signs peaked between 22 and 35 dpi. a vaccinated pig was 2.67 times more likely to receive veterinary treatment during peak PCVAD than a nonvaccinated pig (P = 0.01). 49 pigs received at least 1 day of systemic veterinary treatment. a vaccinated pig was 1.79 times more likely to receive veterinary treatment than a nonvaccinated pig. 7 pigs without clinical signs were also necropsied. scores were assigned as follows: 0, no macroscopic lesions; 1, pneumonia affecting 25% of gross lung; 2, pneumonia affecting 25 to 50% of gross lung; 3, pneumonia affecting 50 to 75% of gross lung; 4, pneumonia affecting >75% of gross lung. of the 101 nonvaccinated pigs, 9 died, resulting in an overall survival rate of 91.1%. a vaccinated pig was 1.7 times more likely to die during the overall study period than a nonvaccinated pig (P = 0.35) increased mortality became apparent after 20 days. anti-PCV2 antibody responses for vaccine and nonvaccine groups were presented as CP(160\u2013233)/CP(43\u2013233) ratios. the higher the ratio, the more the immune response is skewed toward the recognition of the decoy epitope. pigs with low CP(160\u2013233)/CP(43\u2013233) ratios are protected from disease. pigs with antibody ratios of 0.5 had significantly lower levels of circulating PCV2 in the serum at 21 (P = 0.0001), 28 (P = 0.0008), 35 (P = 0.007), and 42 (P = 0.03) dpi than pigs with higher ratios. results confirm earlier findings describing the nonprotective effect of anti-CP(160\u2013233) antibodies. improved ADG for the vaccinated pigs likely resulted from the positive effect of vaccination in reducing PRRS-associated clinical signs and virus load. the third phase covered the period from the onset of PCVAD, beginning at about 3 weeks after virus challenge, to the end of the study. PRRSV viremia is decreased after PRRS vaccination, but PCV2 viremia is increased. of the 84 pig sera tested, 78 (93%) had detectable levels of the vaccine virus. prior to challenge, the nonvaccine group was negative for PRRSV nucleic acid in serum. PRRSV and PCV2 viremia in vaccinated and nonvaccinated pigs. values are means 1 standard deviation. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between groups. the first was a PRRSV-associated syndrome, aural cyanosis. blue ear was easily identified in pigs by the presence of red, cyanotic, or blue discoloration of the ear tissue. however, during the postchallenge period, 64 of all 226 pigs (28.3%) were documented as having blue ear on one or more days. clinical signs were assessed as described in Materials and Methods. primary clinical sign associated with acute PRRSV infection is respiratory disease resulting from interstitial pneumonia. Lungs were removed from 20 euthanized pigs (10 pigs from each group) lesions typical of PCVAD were found by gross anatomical and microscopic examinations of lungs and lymph nodes from pigs that died or were euthanized. pigs showed multifocal to diffuse interstitial pneumonia with mottling of lung tissue, hemorrhage, and consolidation. lymph nodes of affected pigs showed depletion of lymphocytes. the number of pigs undergoing treatment as a result of PCVAD-associated clinical signs peaked between 22 and 35 dpi. 39 pigs received at least 1 day of veterinary treatment, including 12 nonvaccinated pigs (12/101 [12%]) and 27 pigs in the vaccine group (27/105 [26%]. 49 pigs received at least 1 day of systemic veterinary treatment. a vaccinated pig was 1.79 times more likely to receive veterinary treatment than a nonvaccinated pig (P = 0.11) over the entire study period. 7 pigs without clinical signs were also necropsied. scores were assigned as follows: 0, no macroscopic lesions; 1, pneumonia affecting 25% of gross lung; 2, pneumonia affecting 25 to 50% of gross lung; 3, pneumonia affecting 50 to 75% of gross lung; 4, pneumonia affecting >75% of gross lung. the data for pigs with clinical signs were statistically different (P = 0.0426) from those for apparently healthy pigs. of the 101 nonvaccinated pigs, 9 died, resulting in an overall survival rate of 91.1%. a vaccinated pig was 1.7 times more likely to die during the overall study period than a nonvaccinated pig (P = 0.35) increased mortality became apparent after 20 days and was associated with the appearance of PCVAD. anti-PCV2 antibody responses for the vaccine and nonvaccine groups were presented as CP(160\u2013233)/CP(43\u2013233) ratios. the higher the ratio, the more the immune response is skewed toward the recognition of the decoy epitope. pigs with low CP(160\u2013233)/CP(43\u2013233) ratios are protected from disease. circulating PCV2 in the serum at 21 (P = 0.0001), 28 (P = 0.0008), 35 (P = 0.007), and 42 (P = 0.03) dpi than pigs with higher ratios. results confirm earlier findings describing the nonprotective effect of anti-CP(160\u2013233) antibodies. DG for the vaccinated pigs likely resulted from positive effect of vaccination on reducing PRRS-associated clinical signs and virus load. the third phase covered the period from the onset of PCVAD, beginning at about 3 weeks after virus challenge, to the end of the study. a significant decrease in ADG was also initially detected for vaccinated pigs on week 3 postchallenge. DISCUSSION Enhanced PCV2 infection leading to PCVAD is typically associated with immune stimulation (22, 23). PRRSV, porcine parvovirus, and mycoplasma hyopneumoniae are common copathogens linked with lymphoproliferation. pigs were inoculated with PCV2 at the age of 6 weeks, vaccinated with the PRRS MLV 2 weeks later, and challenged with PRRSV at the age of 12 weeks. the group with PCV2 and the MLV exhibited lower ADG and more-severe lung lesions after PRRSV challenge. the authors attributed the lesions to PRRSV infection. a survey conducted on 70 pig farms in the Netherlands included questions about PRRS MLV use on farms with and without PMWS or PCVAD. the results showed that the PRRS MLV is a significant risk factor for PMWS outbreaks (38). however, an analysis of the effect of the PRRS MLV on farms affected by PCVAD in the united states found that farms incorporating the PRRS MLV have significantly lower levels of PCV2 viremia. 32 of 226 pigs had detectable PCV2 in serum at the time of challenge. the presence of PCV2 prior to challenge had to be considered a possible factor in postchallenge response. this was especially true due to the difference between the proportion of PCV2-positive pigs in the two groups. the 39 clinically ill pigs did maintain significantly higher levels (P 0.02) of circulating PCV2 during peak PCVAD. the increased incidence of PCVAD in vaccinated pigs between 22 and 35 dpi may also be the result of greater levels of localized PCV2 in tissues. vaccinated pigs in this study increased ADG in the first 2 weeks postchallenge. at least three mechanisms may be involved in the enhancement of PCVAD. the PRRS MLV may stimulate the immune system and increase the number of PCV2-permissive cells. there are several countries in which PRRS MLV vaccination is in wide use. however, there is the potential for new and emerging PCV2 strains to escape current vaccine protection. emerging PCV2 mutant strains have been documented in china (53)."}
