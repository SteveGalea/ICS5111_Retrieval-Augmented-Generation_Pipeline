{"summary": "interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine expressed by many cell types. IL-6 can play a beneficial role during the immune response by contributing to neutrophil activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and development of the Th17 CD4 T cell subset. persistent IL-6 induction during infection can contribute to detrimental effects on surrounding neurons or bone. myelitis (EAE) in mice immunized peripherally with myelin peptides. mice deficient in IL-6 are resistant to development of EAE (32, 40). such data suggest that IL-6 expression may be essential to control early viral infection, yet contributes to pathology. p38 ERK MAPK pathways are activated in response to TMEV infection. differences in MAPKs, IL-12, and IFN- expression may be related to disparities in susceptibility of macrophages to persistent infection. the 8- to 12-week-old female B10.S and SJL/J mice were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and ERK MAPK inhibitor U0126 were obtained from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI) the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, L-NIL, was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and incubated with macrophag macrophages were elicited by intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml thioglycolate broth into mice. four days later, the peritoneal cavities were each flushed with 2 ml DMEM. cells were incubated at 1 106 cells/2 ml of DMEM cell culture medium. RNA was extracted from cells using the RNAeasy kit of Qiagen (Valencia, CA), the PerfectPure kit from 5Prime (Gaithersburg, MD) or the Purelink kit from Ambion/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. one twenty-fifth of the cDNA sample was incubated with 0.4 M the following primer pairs (Invitrogen) TMEV sense 5\u2032 CTTCCCTCTCAGGCAAAGTACGCT 3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032 GTGTTCCTCTACAGTAG 3\u2032, or GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) sense 5\u2032 TTGTCAGCAATGCATCATCATCATGCAC 3\u2032, and antisense 5\u2032 GTGTTCCTCTCTCTTG3\u2032. ELISA plates were coated with antibodies to mouse IL-6 (MP horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000; BD-Pharmingen) was added for 30 min. then 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzindine substrate\u2013hydrogen peroxide solution (BD-Pharmingen) was added to each well. IL-6 was measured by determining optical densities at a 450-nm wavelength. the washed membrane was scanned with a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. densitometric analysis was done with LI-COR imaging software. color development at 570 nm is proportional to nitric oxide in supernatants. the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, L-NIL, was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and incubated with macrophages, where indicated, at 10 M. affinity-purified neutralizing rat antibody to mouse IL-6 (clone MP5-20F3) (48) was obtained from Invitrogen. untreated or pretreated macrophages were uninfected, infected with 100 l of the TMEV stock (2.5 105 PFU), stimulated with 1 g/ml LPS, stimulated with 50 g poly(I C), or left unstimulated. cell extracts were collected for RNA preparation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP were transcribed in 0.5 mM (each) dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP. superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42\u00b0C for 1.5 h followed by 94\u00b0C for 5 min. TMEV RNA data are reported as percentages of TMEV RNA in nontreated macrophages. ELISA plates were coated with antibodies to mouse IL-6 (MP5-20F3; BD-Pharmingen) after washes, cell culture supernatants or serial dilutions of recombinant IL-6 (BD-Pharmingen) were added to each well. 20 microliters of each sample containing 20 g of protein was run on a 10% SDS\u2013Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gel. the membrane was treated with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. the membrane was scanned with a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. TMEV-induced IL-6 production is greater in TMEV-resistant B10.S macrophages. IL-6 contributes to both antiviral immunity and virus-induced pathology. TMEV is cleared from macrophages of TMEV-resistant mice. SJL/J macrophages (1 106) were infected with 2 105 to 10 105 PFU of TMEV in the absence of 10 ng/ml recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) (C and E), 0.01 to 10 ng/ml rIL-6 (D), or 3 g/ml anti-IL-6-Fab (E), or SJL/J macrophages were treated with 10 ng/ml rIL-6 exogenous IL-6 significantly reduced TMEV RNA at 24 h p.i. in SJL/J macrophages. IL-6 preemptively triggered antiviral activity in SJL/J macrophages. early differences in the amount of IL-6 present during the course of infection play an important role in the establishment of TMEV in SJL/J mice. addition of exogenous IL-6 at 1, 3, 6, and 7 h p.i. significantly reduced TMEV RNA in SJL/J macrophages compared to the level in untreated macrophages. addition of IFN- at 7 h p.i. significantly reduced TMEV RNA in SJL/J macrophages. findings warrant further investigation into strain differences in early TMEV-induced IL-6 expression. TMEV-induced IL-6 protein secreted by B10.S macrophages was significantly greater than that secreted by SJL/J macrophages. TMEV-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased in macrophages treated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. ERK MAPK activation is required for optimum TMEV-induced IL-6 expression in response to TMEV infection. data are means of 5 samples from two experiments evaluated by Student's t test. we have also shown that the Toll-like receptor 3 pathway is involved in macrophage cytokine responses to TMEV infection by inducing IFN-, IL-12, and IL-23 (1). IL-6 expression by macrophages in response to TMEV is enhanced by IL-12. treatment with IL-12 p70 or p70 significantly enhanced TMEV replication in both B10.S and SJL/J macrophages. IL-12 and IFN- enhance IL-6 expression and decrease TMEV replication during TMEV infection of B10.S and SJL/J macrophages. a total of 1 106 macrophages (M) from SJL/J and B10.S mice were untreated (control) or treated with IL-12 p70 (1 ng/ml), IFN- (10 ng/ml) or IL-12 p40 (10 ng/ml) 45 min before IL-12 and ERK-MAPK contribute to IL-6 expression during TMEV infection. a total of 1 106 RAW264.7 macrophage cells were untreated (control) or treated with IL-12 p70 (1 ng/ml) with or without 40 M U0126 ERK MAPK inhibitor 45 min before and during infection with 1 106 PFU of TMEV. IL-6 treatment did not decrease TMEV RNA expression at 3 and 8 h p.i. in RAW264.7 cells. the time period in which TMEV-induced events occur in RAW264.7 cells is slightly different from that seen in SJL/J macrophages. TMEV infection alone failed to activate STAT1 by 30 min p.i. but did so by 6 h p.i. treatment of RAW264.7 cells with either IL-6 or IFN- activated STAT1 and STAT3 as early as 30 min after TMEV challenge. IL-6 activates STAT1 and STAT3 in macrophages. Western blots of phospho-STAT1, phospho-STAT3, total STAT3 and -tubulin at 30 min and 6 h in TMEV cells. data are means of 5 samples, each evaluated by Student's t test. TMEV infection of TMEV-challenged RAW264.7 cells did not result in significant nitric oxide production at 24 h p.i. however, addition of exogenous IL-6 to TMEV-infected cells resulted in a significant enhancement of nitric oxide secretion. IL-6 or NONOate, a nitric oxide donor, repressed TMEV replication in RAW264.7 cells. TMEV RNA replication is significantly higher in SJL/J macrophages than in B10.S macrophages. IL-6 mRNA or protein secretion was induced from SJL/J macrophages (M) 3 and 8 h after TMEV infection. recombinant IL-6 was added to SJL/J macrophages 30 min prior to TMEV infection. treatment with 10 ng/ml exogenous IL-6 significantly reduced TMEV replication at 8 h postinfection (p.i.) IL-6 preemptively triggered antiviral activity in SJL/J macrophages. otype control antibody resulted in a significant reduction in TMEV replication. addition of isotype antibody had a similar effect on TMEV infection of macrophages. addition of isotype antibody had a similar effect on TMEV infection of macrophages. TMEV-induced IL-6 expression in macrophages is dependent on ERK MAPK. the cell signaling pathway activated by TMEV infection leading to IL-6 expression in macrophages is not well understood. TMEV-induced IL-6 expression in macrophages is not well understood. ERK MAPK activation is required for optimum TMEV-induced IL-6 expression. 1 106 macrophages were untreated or pretreated with 20 M SB203580 (SB) or 40 M U0126 (U) for 30 min before infection with 2 105 PFU of TMEV. inhibition of ERK MAPK activation with U0126 significantly reduced IL-6 expression to the same extent in both B10.S and SJL/J macrophages responding to LPS. therefore, ERK MAPK activation is required for IL-6 expression that occurs from activation of TLR3 and TLR4 pathways. p40, or p70 decreases TMEV replication in SJL/J macrophages. treatment with IL-12 p70 or p40 significantly enhanced IL-6 expression in response to TMEV in both B10.S and SJL/J macrophages at 24 and/or 48 h post-TMEV infection. data are means of 3 samples each evaluated by Student's t test. IL-12 expresses IL-6 well, expresses IL-12 poorly, and activates ERK MAPK following TMEV infection. IL-12 and ERK-MAPK contribute to IL-6 expression during TMEV infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. IL-6 has direct antiviral activity against TMEV replication in RAW264.7 cells. first, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml exogenous recombinant IL-6 30 min prior to and during challenge with TMEV. as little as 0.1 ng/ml significantly reduced TMEV RNA at 24 h p.i. IL-6 antiviral activity against TMEV replication is associated with activation of STAT1-related antiviral activity. treatment of macrophages with IL-6 leads to activation of STAT3 by phosphorylation at its tyrosine 705. pretreatment with exogenous IL-6 of RAW264.7 cells with STAT1 knocked down resulted in a reduction of TMEV infection back to a level seen in untreated RAW264.7 cells infected with TMEV. however, addition of exogenous IL-6 to RAW264.7 cells with STAT3 knocked down significantly reduced TMEV RNA replication compared with the level in untreated RAW264.7 cells infected with TMEV. real-time PCR of IRF1 (B), IRF7 (C), IRF9 (D) and IFN- (E) in RAW cells treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 prior to and during TMEV infection after 3 and 6 h of infection. IL-6 and activated STAT1 (29) also induce expression of nitric oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide, which is a potent antiviral factor (41) IL-6 induces nitric oxide and nitric oxide is antiviral, it does not play the decisive role in the IL-6-induced antiviral effect observed in macrophages in vitro. the results are surprising because research on chronic TMEV infection has supported the theory that enhanced IL-6 expression may play a detrimental role in the immunopathology of TMEV in susceptible mice (14). the results suggest that the ability to control TMEV replication in macrophages begins during the first 24 h after infection is to a large extent dependent on macrophage production of IL-6. thus, IL-6 production by virally infected cells may have dual roles in viral infection by contributing to both antiviral immunity and subsequent pathology. ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are involved in both innate antiviral immunity (7) and IL-6 expression in response to TMEV. the results herein confirm that activation of ERK MAPKs contribute to IL-6 expression in response to TMEV. TMEV induction of IL-6 in macrophages is in part dependent on macrophage production of IL-12. IL-12 enhances IL-6 expression during viral infection (18), IL-6 expression depends in part on activation of ERK (19), and IL-12 activates ERK MAPK (20) these results are consistent with previous data that showed significantly more IL-12 production from B10.S macrophages than that of SJL/J macrophages following TMEV infection (37). both roles of IL-12 are likely to be beneficial to early antiviral immunity. with TMEV, IL-6 controls acute viral infection by inducing multiple innate antiviral programs. differences in translational or inhibitory control of IL-6 expression could contribute to susceptibility versus resistance of macrophages to TMEV. IL-12 and ERK MAPK play a major role in TMEV-induced IL-6. IL-6 is also antiviral in RAW264.7 cells, IL-6 expression is enhanced by IL-12. IL-6 leads to activation of STAT1 and expression of its downstream genes. 1.2KB, html)."}
