{"summary": "the estimated diabetes prevalence for 2015 has risen to 387 million, representing 8.3% of the world's adult population. it has been predicted that by 2035 the number of people with diabetes will have risen to 592 million (2\u20134) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase. the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of overexpressed eNOS on cell proliferation and apoptosis with SIRT1 activation in the mouse pancreatic cell line, Min6. the mouse eNOS cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.0 using notI and HindIII restriction sites. all joints in the constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) mice pancreatic cell line Min6 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, 10% heat inactivated newborn calf serum, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Min6 cells were collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 l binding buffer containing 5 l Annexin V (10 g/ml) for 10 min in the dark. the cells were then incubated with 10 l PI (20 g/ml) cycles, melt curve analysis and 2% agar electrophoresis were performed to assess the purity of the PCR products. eNOS mRNA and SIRT1 mRNA were normalized to the quantity of GAPDH mRNA using the 2Cq method (13). anti-mouse eNOS (cat. no. SA-201-0100; 1:4,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-mouse GAPDH (cat. no. sc-365062; 1:20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) the blots were subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG; monoclonal antibody and agarose ligand were washed, eluted by boiling in 2X SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto membranes. blots were then incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (cat. no. BHR101-1; 1:10,000; Bersee, Biomart company, Beijing, China) each segment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Takara LA Taq or Primestar (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) and cloned into the pcDNA3.0 vector. all joints in the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. apoptosis assay Following plasmid transfection for 24 h, the apoptotic cells were quantified using an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis kit. min6 cells were collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 l binding buffer containing 5 l Annexin V (10 g/ml) for 10 min in the dark. PCR was monitored for 45 cycles using an annealing temperature of 60\u00b0C. melt curve analysis and 2% agar electrophoresis were performed. Negative control reactions were routinely included to monitor potential contamination of reagents. anti-mouse eNOS (cat. no. SA-201-0100; 1:4,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-mouse SIRT1 (cat. no. sc-74465; 1:4,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-mouse GAPDH (cat. no. 111-035-003; 1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) blots were incubated with a secondary antibody (hors mouse anti-SIRT1 (cat. no. sc-74465; 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) monoclonal antibody and agarose ligand (Catch and Release v2.0; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by incubation at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the immune complexes were washed, eluted by boiling in 2X SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and each segment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Takara LA Taq or Primestar (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) and cloned into the pcDNA3.0 vector. all joints in the constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) indo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan. solution was added to each well and were incubated for 1 h. the cells were quantified using an Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis kit. PCR signals were detected with a DNA Engine Opticon 2 Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) PCR was monitored for 45 cycles using an annealing temperature of 60\u00b0C. at the end of the PCR cycles, melt curve analysis and 2% agar electrophoresis was performed. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described. the signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. anti-mouse eNOS (cat. no. SA-201-0100; 1:4,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-mouse SIRT1 (cat. no. sc-74465; 1:4,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) the supernatant was incubated with 10 l mouse anti-eNOS (cat. no.
