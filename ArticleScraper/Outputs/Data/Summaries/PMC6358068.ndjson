{"summary": "recombinant antigens induced by parasitic infections are more specific than natural ones. but several studies have shown just the contrary. the presence of contaminants derived from the expression of His-tagged proteins may explain the poor specificity of such antigens. in the present study we grafted the linear sequence MTFSVPIS into a His-tagged Fasciola hepatica recombinant protein (leucine aminopeptidase; FhLAP) native FhLAP was previously tested as target antigen for immunodiagnosis of human and animal infections in domestic ruminants (sheep and cattle) sera from non-infected sheep (n = 20) were obtained from animals reared in the Fasciola-free environment of the \u201cCentro de Investigaciones Agrarias de Mabegondo\u201d (INGACAL-CIAM), A Corua (Spain) fecal samples from non-infected sheep were collected from animals of the strains above. nematodes belonging to the families Trichostrongylidae, Molineidae (Nematodirus spp.), Ancylostomatidae, Strongylidae, and Trichuridae (Trichuris spp.) were frequently identified in both sheep herds. most of the cows had intestinal nematodes from one or more genera of Trichostrongylidae, Trichuridae (Trichuris RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, 0.3 g/L L-glutamine, 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate and antibiotics, at 38\u00b0C under 5% CO2 in air. the flukes were then transferred to 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and maintained in culture medium (3 mL/fluke) after 24 h incubation, the medium containing the secreted antigens was removed and centrif the amplified FhLAP gene (1562 bp) was cloned into the vector pGEM-T vector (Promega Biotech Ib\u00e9rica SL, Madrid, Spain) following standard protocols. the plasmid FhLAP DNA extracted from the gel (Qiagen; Qiagen Iberia SL, Madrid, Spain) was automatically sequenced using fluorescence-base labeling with ABI PRISM system. pQE30-US9-FhLAP DNA (10 LAP1) was used as template at a 1/1,000 dilution to amplify the chimera. plasmid US9-FhLAP DNA extracted from the gel was automatically sequenced using fluorescence-based labeling with ABI PRISM system. recombinant pQE30-US9-FhLAP was transformed into XL1 blue cells. cells were mixed with 20% of sterile glycerol and stored at -80\u00b0C. a colony of transformed cells was grown in 1 L of LB medium at 37\u00b0C. rUS9-FhLAP was purified by IMAC chromatography with the HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) under non-denaturing conditions. the solution containing soluble rUS9-FhLAP (pre-diluted 1/4 with PBS containing 10 mM imidazole) was added with the aid of a peristaltic pump (5 mL/min) the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Am non-transformed, M15 cells and protein fractions purified by IMAC were separated in 10\u201320% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels. membranes were incubated with mAb US9 (1/2,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad, 1/3,000) after a washing step. membranes were washed again, and bands were developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochlor polystyrene microtiter plates coated with purified mAb MM3. plates were incubated for 2 h at RT and then washed three times with PBS. 100 L of each serum sample (from sheep or cattle) diluted 1/100 in PBS-T-SM was added to each Ag+ and Ag- well. cut-off 1 was calculated as the sum of the maximum OD value obtained for negative sera from each species plus one SD. cut-off 2 was determined by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis for 100% specificity. the wells of ELISA plates were coated with 100 L of a previously calculated optimal concentration of rUS9-FhLAP protein (3 g/mL) in PBS, incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS and blocked with 200 L/well of 1.5% sodium caseinate in PBS for 1 h at RT. the plates were then washed five times with PBS-T, and bound IgG antibodies were detected as described above rUS9-FhLAP ELISA using cattle sera prediluted 1/100 in PBS-T-SM containing 0.125 mM of the US9 peptide. wells of ELISA plates were coated with 100 L of IMAC-retained M15 soluble proteins (4 g/mL) in PBS, incubated ON at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 200 L/well of 1.5% sodium caseinate in PBS for 1 plates were incubated with 100 L/well of a goat anti-lipid A LPS polyclonal antibody. they were then washed five times with PBS-T, and bound IgG antibodies were detected. the plates were then washed five times with PBS-T and incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm. the ROC curves were calculated using the MedCalc v. 17.7.2 software. blood samples were collected from non-infected sheep and cattle by veterinarians. sera from non-infected cattle (n = 49) and naturally Fasciola-infected cattle (n = 36) were randomly selected from the collection of sera stored at INGACAL-CIAM. fecal samples from these animals tested negative in MM3-COPRO ELISA. live adult flukes were collected from the bile ducts of naturally infected cows. they were then transferred to 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and maintained in culture medium (3 mL/fluke) after 24 h incubation, the medium containing the secreted antigens was removed and centrifuged. the secreting hybridoma cells were grown intraperitoneally in pristan-primed BALB/c mice. the anti\u2013Trichinella and F. hepatica IgG1/ antibodies were purified from the ascitic fluid by caprylic acid/ammonium sulfate precipitation. the amplified FhLAP gene was amplified by Touchdown-PCR using a set of primers based on the sequence gb|AY644459: positive recombinant plasmids were selected by standard PCR with the universal primers D and SP6. further, the plasmid FhLAP DNA extracted from the gel (Qiagen; Qiagen Iberia SL, Madrid, Spain) was automatically sequenced, using fluorescence-base labeling with ABI PRISM system. pQE30-US9-FhLAP was transformed into XL1 blue cells. a colony of transformed cells was grown in 1 L of LB medium at 37\u00b0C. rUS9-FhLAP protein expression induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG to the cell culture. the cells were harvested by 20 min centrifugation at 5,000 g. the pellet was resuspended in 50 mL of B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent. lysozyme and DNase I, as indicated by the supplier, pipetted up and down. the suspension was homogeneous and incubated with shaking for an additional 30 min at RT. protein concentration measured by micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. non-transformed M15 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C for 8h without addition of IPTG. soluble protein fraction extracted after induction with IPTG of transformed, and non-transformed, M15 cells. mAb MM3 (MM3-ELISA) was used as reference method to compare sensitivity and specificity of this test with the results obtained using rUS9-FhLAP as target antigen in indirect and capture ELISAs. polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with purified mAb MM3 (100 L/well at 5 g/mL in PBS), incubated ON at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS and blocked IgG antibodies were detected with either HRP-conjugated mouse anti-sheep/goat IgG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, 1/30,000 in PBS-T-SM), or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgG1 polyclonal antibodies (Bio-Rad, 1/6,000 in PBS-T-SM) the plates were then washed, and incubated for 20 min at RT with the plates were added to each well in odd (Ag+) and even (Ag-) plates. the plates were incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm. 100 L of each serum sample (from sheep or cattle) diluted 1/100 in PBS-T-SM was added to each well. the plates were then incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm. rUS9-fhLAP ELISA was developed with cattle serum samples. as inhibitor, the synthetic peptide MTFSVPIS (US9-recognizing epitope) was used. the mAb US9 was used as a control to calculate the optimal inhibitory concentration of the US9 synthetic peptide. the wells of ELISA plates were coated with 100 L of a PBS solution containing LPS from E. coli serotype O55:B5 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 g/mL, incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 200 L/well of 1.5% sodium caseinate in PBS for 1 h at RT. the plates were then washed five times with PBS-T mAb MM3 (MM3-ELISA) was used to adjust the adequate dilution of anti-lipid A LPS polyclonal antibody. the mAb MM3 (MM3-ELISA) was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of this test with the results obtained using rUS9-FhLAP as target antigen in indirect and capture ELISAs. incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm, washed five times with PBS-T. bound IgG antibodies were detected with either HRP-conjugated mouse anti-sheep/goat IgG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, 1/30,000 in PBS-T-SM), or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgG1 polyclonal antibodies (Bio-Rad the plates were incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm. then washed five times with PBS-T, before 100 L of each serum sample was added to each Ag+ and Ag- well in duplicate. the plates were then incubated for 30 min at RT with shaking at 750 rpm. as inhibitor, the synthetic peptide MTFSVPIS (US9-recognizing epitope) was used to calculate the optimal inhibitory concentration of the US9 synthetic peptide. the previous peptide dilution (0.125 mM) was selected to be used for inhibition of sera in indirect competitive ELISA. cattle sera prediluted 1/100 in PBS-T-SM containing 0.125 mM of the peptide. the OD values for each sample were calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding obtained in the absence of cattle serum (OD = 0.042) the wells of ELISA plates were coated with 100 L of a PBS solution containing LPS from E. coli serotype O55:B5 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 g/mL, incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 200 L/well of bioinformatics tools Theoretical isoelectric points, instability indices, aliphatic indices and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) values were calculated using the ProtParam bioinformatics tool from Expasy (https://www.expasy.org/resources). the aliphatic index decreased to 34.0 and the GRAVY value was -0.735. gb| MF945962 and gb| MF945962 have the same extension (1569 bp) a very high identity (99.99%) with only 8 nucleotide changes. the presence of rUS9-FhLAP truncates could be confirmed in WB. the protein is correctly expressed in E. coli, appearing as a major band with an approximate Mr of 60 kDa. rUS9-FhLAP was a target antigen in capture ELISA with mAb US9. each serum was tested simultaneously in indirect ELISA using rUS9-FhLAP. ELISA OD values obtained testing sera from infected sheep. IND = sera tested in indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP antigen as target. MM3 = sera tested in capture ELISA with mAb MM3. all sera from infected and non-infected cattle were correctly classified using either indirect ELISA or capture US9-ELISA. the best results were obtained, as expected, with MM3-ELISA. only 4/18 (22.2%) of sera reached these values with the other two ELISA methods. fected cattle sera testing positive in indirect ELISA. only 10/36 (27.8%) and 13/36 (36.1%) samples were classified as positive using cut-off 1 and cut-off 2 respectively. IND = sera tested in capture ELISA with mAb MM3 (MM3-ELISA; reference test) indirect ELISA and capture US9-ELISA immunoassays use the same rFhLAP antigen. however, these results were better than those obtained by indirect ELISA. a doubt arises concerning the concordance between classification of positive and negative sera by both methods. indirect ELISA carried out an inhibition ELISA using a synthetic peptide derived from the gp53 Trichinella protein containing the MTFSVPIS sequence recognized by mAb US9. as expected, the incubation of cattle sera with the peptide did not change the reactivity of non-infected and infected sera (Fig 6A) a broad MW range (10\u2013200 kDa) of soluble proteins from non-transformed M15 E. coli bond to the IMAC column. these proteins are recognized in indirect ELISA by sera from non-infected cattle. reactivity observed in indirect ELISA testing sera from non-infected cattle significantly correlated with that obtained using IMAC-purified rUS9-FhLAP. each point represents the paired OD values obtained for each serum in the indirect ELISAs. blue lines represent the 95% upper and lower confidence levels. another possible target for cross-reactive natural antibodies in cattle is LPS [36] each point represents the paired OD values obtained for each serum. the alignment of the amino acid sequence corresponding to the ORF of the rUS9-FhLAP protein cloned in this study (gb| MF945962) and the sequence reported by Acosta et al. is shown in Fig 1. cDNA sequences gb| MF945962 and gb| AAV59016 have same extension (1569 bp) a very high identity (99.99%) with only 8 nucleotide changes (C31T, C78A, G93A, T1090C, C1210G, C1210G, C1210G, C1210G, C1251T, C1337T, A1489G) the positioning of the US9 epitope between the poly-His tag and the FhLAP sequence is adequate for the objective of the study. the data in Fig 2B and 2C showed that the sheep serum reacted with the recombinant antigen in a dose-dependent manner. analysis was carried out with a serum from a sheep as primary antibody. recognition of rUS9-FhLAP by sera from infected and non-infected ruminants. a single-step affinity-purification of soluble recombinant antigens produced in E. coli may involve the presence of variable amounts of contaminant proteins from the host. IND = sera tested in capture ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP antigen as target. MM3 = sera tested in capture ELISA with mAb MM3 (MM3-ELISA; reference test) all sera from infected and non-infected cattle were correctly classified using the MM3-ELISA regardless of the two cut-off values investigated. the data also revealed that the antigens present in the rUS9-FhLAP preparation are strongly recognized by a large number of non-infected cattle sera in indirect ELISA. cut-off 1 and cut-off 2 values for each ELISA were as follows: OD = 1.174 and 0.963 (IND); OD = 0.111 and 0.084 (US9); OD = 0.075 and 0.059 (MM3). compared to the indirect ELISA, capture of the rUS9-FhLAP antigen by mAb US9 drastically decreased the OD values obtained with non-infected cattle sera. a considerable amount of sera produced discordant OD values comparing both ELISA and US9-ELISA. each point represents the paired OD values obtained for each serum. blue lines represent the 95% upper and lower confidence levels. each point represents the paired OD values obtained for each serum in indirect ELISA using rUS9-FhLAP as target antigen. we first investigated whether this could be due to soluble M15 E. coli proteins that could bind to the chromatographic column and co-elute during IMAC purification of rUS9-FhLAP. the protein profiles were firstly revealed by SDS-PAGE and protein staining with blueSafe. elute with recombinant proteins during IMAC purification. the target of cattle antibodies are conformational epitopes. a possible correlation between OD values obtained with sera from non-infected cattle. lipid A polyclonal antibodies produced low OD values in wells of ELISA plates coated with rUS9-FhLAP (OD = 0.12) and no signal in the wells coated with mAb US9 plus rUS9-FhLAP. results in Fig 8 showed no correlation (p = 0.62) between OD values obtained for non-infected cattle sera tested against rUS9-FhLAP and LPS, both in indirect ELISA we engineered a recombinant FhLAP by incorporating two affinity tags in tandem (6XHis and MTFSVPIS) at its amino terminal region aimed to improve its purification free of contaminants by mAb US9. the classical 6XHis is the most commonly used tag for single-step purification of recombinant proteins, allowing purities of up to 95% with 90% recovery of the tagged protein [8]. soluble proteins with affinity for Ni(II) ions were also observed among soluble proteins obtained from non-transformed M15 cells using PBS plus 5mM imidazole as loading and washing buffer. similar observations were also reported using the more antigenic Fasciola recombinant cathepsins L as target in ELISA. the absence of correlation between such antibody response and that obtained against rUS9-FhLAP excludes E. coli lipid A as a source of cross-reactivity in our study. however, the absence of correlation between such antibody response and that obtained against rUS9-FhLAP excludes E. coli lipid A. recombinant fusion proteins can be used to link epitopes within chimeric multiepitope recombinant antigens. the MTFSVPIS sequence belongs to a nematode protein, but its recognition by sera from infected animals in capture ELISA is not possible. or selected fragments of cathepsins L to develop robust immunodiagnostic tests without the necessity of obtaining live parasites in abattoirs."}
