{"summary": "mosquito egg samples were collected in the municipality of Jojutla, morelos, Mexico. 269 cases were reported by the end of the year, of which 69 were from Jojutla. in 2016, 180 ovitraps were placed and maintained throughout the year in different locations. we incubated the macerated larvae pools with Trizol (Invitrogen) for 10 min. we extracted total RNA from the lysates using a nanodrop 2000. we diluted macerated larvae pools in maintenance medium (EMEM medium with 1% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin) and filtered them through 0.22 m membranes. twenty-four hours before infection, we seeded C6/36 cells in 24-well plates at 80% of confluence in growth medium (EMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL str we washed the cells twice with PBS and then incubated them with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody. after the incubation period, we washed them twice with PBS and then mounted them with VECTASHIELD medium with DAPI. after the adsorption period, we removed the virus and overlaid cell monolayers. infected Vero cell monolayers of rRNA using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (human/mouse/rat) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. we constructed RNaseq Illumina shotgun libraries at the unidad Universitaria de Secuenciaci\u00f3n Masiva y Bioinform\u00e1tica-Instituto de Biotecnologa. low-quality positions and reads were eliminated using in-house scripts. mosquito egg samples were collected in the municipality of Jojutla, morelos, mexico. 69 cases were reported by the end of the year, of which 69 were from Jojutla. insets show location of Morelos in Mexico and Jojutla in Morelos. we placed egg papers in water containers and incubated them at 37\u00b0C for 1 wk under 24-h light/dark cycles. after the incubation period, we collected larvae in stages 2\u20133 and separated them into pools of 20\u201330 larvae. probe Zikv 1107-FAM probe 5\u2032-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAGTCAGACACTCAA-3\u2032 calculated the minimum infection rate (MIR) of the larvae pools by the total number of positive larvae tested and multiplying by 1,000. we selected the larvae pools that tested positive for Zika virus RNA and displayed the lowest quantitation cycle (Cq) values. at 48 hours postinfection, we fixed cells with 4% paraformaldehyde. blocked cells using 10% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h. then incubated them overnight at 4\u00b0C with a 1:500 dilution of the monoclonal antibody 4G2. we depleted 200 ng of total RNA extracted from the supernatants of infected Vero cell monolayers of rRNA using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (human/mouse/rat) we constructed RNaseq Illumina shotgun libraries at the unidad Universitaria de Secuenciaci\u00f3n Masiva y Bioinform\u00e1tica-Instituto de Biotecnologa. d-hit-test (19) used 98 sequences for phylogenetic inference by maximum likelihood in RAxML (20) we normalized branch lengths and condensed nodes with bootstrap values 50% to emphasize tree topology. alignment with tool meta-CATS (21) performed a 2 test to find positions with different polymorphism distribution between groups. 11 of 17 pools tested positive for Zika virus RNA that displayed the lowest Cq values to attempt viral isolation. we were able to isolate infectious Zika virus from only 1 of the larvae pools (31N), as determined by the presence of cytopathic effect in C6/36 and vero cells. the strain ZIKV/Aedes.sp/MEX/MEX_I-7/2016 belongs to a Zika virus isolated from Aedes mosquitoes obtained in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. BLAST results of the assembled contig revealed that the strain ZIKV/Aedes.sp/MEX/MEX_I-7/2016 had the highest identity (98.8%) with our isolate. were found in nonstructural (NS2) genes: 5 in NS2A, 4 in NS3, 2 in NS5, and 1 in NS1 (Table 2). Residue diversity between Zika virus isolate 31N from an Aedes aegypti larval pool. phylogenetic reconstruction of the complete genomes of 98 Zika virus sequences. the 31N isolate belongs to the Asian-American lineage of Zika virus and clusters together with other sequences of human and mosquito origin from Mexico. to determine the proportion of infected larvae in the population, we calculated MIRs for the 2 collection periods (June and November 2016) and found an increase in the MIR observed from the larvae raised from the eggs collected in June (2.5) to the MIR from the eggs collected in November (6.9). the ability of the 31N isolate to infect a mammalian cell line was confirmed by the appearance of the characteristic cytopathic effect of Zika virus in infected Vero cell cultures. the 31N isolate has the ability to produce lytic plaques; thus, this isolate can be considered cytopathic in mammalian cell culture. we identified SNVs in positions 3176, 3286, and 5636 that were unique to the larva genome. on the other hand, the SNVs in positions 2071 and 3333 were found in human-derived sequences. the polymorphism in position 3333 was common with 2 sequences from Mexico. phylogenetic reconstruction of the complete genomes of 98 Zika virus sequences, including the 31N isolate, revealed that the 31N isolate belongs to the Asian-American lineage of Zika virus. the phylogenetic reconstruction of selected complete Zika virus genomes revealed that the 31N isolate belongs to the Asian-American lineage of Zika virus. 98 complete genome sequences of Zika viruses obtained from the Virus Pathogen Resource database. nodes with bootstrap values support 50% were condensed and branch lengths were normalized to emphasize tree topology. the absence of reported zika virus human cases in June could be the result of asymptomatic cases, clinically misdiagnosed as dengue virus infections, or both. it is possible that vertical transmission is contributing to the number of infected mosquitoes, which are capable of transmitting this virus to a higher number of humans. ypti mosquitoes by the successful isolation of infectious Zika virus (31N) from larvae raised from field-collected eggs suggest that this virus could be potentially transmissible between mosquitoes and their vertebrate hosts. however, this transmission still needs to be demonstrated."}
