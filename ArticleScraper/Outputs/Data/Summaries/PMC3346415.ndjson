{"summary": "the number of countries in which poliovirus is endemic has decreased from more than 125 to 4. the estimated number of polio cases has decreased from 350,000 to fewer than 1,351 in 2010 (9, 10, 22) poliovirus is still circulating in regions where many people are not vaccinated and live close together in poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. several outbreaks of poliomyelitis caused by OPVs have occurred when conditions for spread of VDPVs were favorable. in unvaccinated populations, infection by wild-type poliovirus may be symptomatic in only 0.1 to 1% of the infected individuals or even less in partially immune groups. infected individuals, whether they are with or without symptoms, will shed high levels of poliovirus in their feces for several weeks. sensitivity and specificity of environmental surveillance are difficult to assess in wild-type poliovirus outbreaks. environmental surveillance can contribute to monitoring the effectiveness of the polio vaccination strategies and to the detection of the remaining level of circulation of vaccine poliovirus strains. early detection of poliovirus circulation is critical for an effective response to outbreaks and to prevent the further spread of the virus. the vaccines were stored at 4\u00b0C until oral administration in 1.0-ml volumes. prechallenge serum-neutralizing antibody levels for poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 and exclusion criteria were used to select elderly, healthy individuals. seronegative persons were challenged with a serotype of the polio vaccine, and seropositive persons were randomly assigned to a challenge with either monovalent OPV1 or OPV3. 0.038 4 67 Seronegative 3 21.8 85.1 2.8 104 (2.4 104 to 2.1 105) 67.4 5 29 IPV vaccinated 3 5.7 31.0 1.3 104 (1.1 104 to 8.7 104) 2.2 6 26 Naturally immune 3 5.0 33.3 5.3 103 (4.6 103 to 4.4 104) 0.59 a Number of participants. liters of water to a final concentration of 0.05 M to enable the formation of a virus-magnesium complex. by reducing the pH to 3.8 (0.2) and adding hydrochloric acid to a final concentration of 0.5 M, these complexes adsorb to a negatively charged cartridge filter (1.2 m nominal; Millipore, Etten-Leur, the Netherlands) in total, 292/549 plaques were excised using a sterile inoculation needle for serotyping in a neutralization test (41). Statistical methods. (i) Feces data. Virus concentrations in feces were estimated from presence or absence in serial dilutions of fecal suspensions. the aggregation of virus suspended in sewage might explain such an observation. the resulting (marginal) numbers of viruses are negatively binomially distributed (38) from the occurrence of either virus type in typed plaques, the fractions (and, hence, their concentrations) of each type can be estimated (Fig. 1 and 2). a total of 228 participants were challenged orally with either monovalent OPV1 or OPV3 and they remained resident in the area during the study period. participants signed an informed consent, and those with major medical problems and/or with a prior OPV vaccination history were not eligible for the study. a 10-liter sewage sample was collected 7 days before the start of the vaccination. a recombinant murine cell line permanently expressing the human poliovirus receptor was used for virus detection in feces. the precipitate was dissolved and neutralized with a concentrated acetic acid buffer (pH 5.0) to a final pH of 7.2 (0.2) the final concentrate was stored at 70\u00b0C until the final concentrate was inoculated onto L20B cells. a hierarchical model was used to estimate the excretion of the challenged population. normal priors were used for the log-transformed virus concentrations in feces of individual subjects. for the population distribution their variation-appropriate hyperpriors were used. 45% shed poliovirus on day 3 after challenge, which peaked with shedding by 57% of the individuals on day 7 with an average poliovirus excretion of 1.3 105 TCID50 per g of feces. in sewage sampled at the pumping engine station, no poliovirus was detected prior to challenge. OPV1 and OPV3 counts in feces peaked on day 8 with mean concentrations of 1.3 109 (5.9 108 to 2.6 109) and 2.6 109 (1.2 109 to 4.6 109) TCID50 in feces. in sewage, the estimated mean OPV counts were also highest on day 8, at 1.2 109 (1.0 109 to 1.4 109). overall immunization rates may conceal unvaccinated individuals, thereby sustaining the circulation of polioviruses in a region for several years (7). the vaccination coverage rate in these areas varies from less than 25% up to 85% and higher than the national vaccination coverage of at least 95% in the Netherlands. environmental poliovirus surveillance can detect 100 poliovirus-infected individuals, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, in a population of several tens of thousands of uninfected individuals. the sensitivity of environmental surveillance may drop below the detection limit due to excessive dilution. polioviruses in sewage approximated the measured initial virus excretion in feces within 1 log10 variation, taking into account the number of inhabitants who discharge on the sewerage and the average water flow at the sewage pumping engine station. poliovirus levels indicate the level of poliovirus circulation in the population. no cases of suspected poliomyelitis have occurred in Finland since 1985. no cases of suspected poliomyelitis have occurred since 1985. recombination and accumulation of point mutations are a recurrent phenomenon in the poliovirus life cycle. the screening of waste waters has been recognized as a useful tool for monitoring the circulation of wild-type poliovirus in populations (12, 13, 15\u201317, 26, 27) the variation in the number of virus particles shed by the individual was highly dependent on the presence or absence of a memory response."}
