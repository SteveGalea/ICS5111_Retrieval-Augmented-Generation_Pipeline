{"summary": "many national health agencies began to screen travelers on entry in airports, ports and border crossings to try to delay local transmission. who raised their pandemic alert level to 4 and then 5 in April. 'local' H1N1 case (i.e. a case not otherwise epidemiologically linked with international travel, contact with an imported case or their secondary infectees) we calculated additional delays associated with entry screening tools versus the observed delays in nations that did not screen. two nations (China and Japan) implemented all four tools. five nations did not implement any of the four tools. screening approaches used n (%) Median interval, days (inter-quartile range) Mean interval, days Mean difference in intervals compared to no screening (95% CI)* No screening 5 (19%) 22 (0, 22) 14 1- Medical checks before disembarkation 2 (8%) 21 (14, 28) 21 7 (-14, 30) 2- Health declaration forms 11 (42%) 22 (13, 34) 23 9 (-4, 24) 3- Symptom screening 13 (50%) 33 (7, 41) 26 12 ( if countries expanded greater effort into entry screening also tended to have better influenza surveillance and were able to identify local transmission earlier, we may have underestimated the effect of entry screening. previous mathematical modeling studies have questioned the value of entry screening, since it could only delay rather than prevent local epidemics. we have not considered the size of local epidemics, or how the degree of connectivity with source regions might relate to time delays between imported and local cases. a delay of 1-2 weeks could be useful if additional time permits more comprehensive planning and preparation for a local epidemic, or shortens the time required for other pandemic mitigation measures. authors' contributions BJC, LLH, PW and HWCW participated in data collection. SR participated in interpreting the results. authors were involved in critical review and editing of the first draft."}
