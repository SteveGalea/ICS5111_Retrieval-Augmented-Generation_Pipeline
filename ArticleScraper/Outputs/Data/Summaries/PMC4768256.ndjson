{"summary": "amino acid residues Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, K184, R195, R199, R213, R214, R221, and R236 were respectively replaced with alanine. kd values for RNA binding to all mutants were larger than that of WT, suggesting these NP residues are likely important for RNA recognition and interaction. the dissociation constants for RNA binding to Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A ranged from 4.5 10\u20138 M to 15 10\u20138 M. previously, Li et al. reported that influenza A virus with NP mutations in Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, R195, R199, R213, and R2 the Y148 residue in the full-length NP was replaced by amino acids. the binding capacity of RNA was decreased in order: WT > Y148F > Y148S Y148R > Y148A. the kd values increased in order: Y148A > Y148S Y148F. Y148A > Y148S > Y148F > Y148R > WT. the positive charge of Y148R was also involved in the interaction between the NP and RNA. the CD spectra of these proteins were scanned from 190 to 250 nm at 25 \u00b0C. Y148 contributes significantly to the structural stability of the NP. compared to other mutant NPs, Y148F had a lowest Tm value. the results indicate that deletion of the tyrosine hydroxyl would significantly reduce the stability of NP. the difference was reduced to 2.5, 1.2 and 2.2 \u00b0C for Y148R, Y148S, and Y148A. a virtual screening was performed to target the Y148 of NP. the potential hits with docking scores over 90 were analyzed. the four compounds that significantly decreased the NP fluorescence by more than 10% were selected for further characterization. the NP fluorescence intensity change of the nucleoprotein of H1N1 binding at a drug/protein molar ratio of 10. orescence decreased with increasing H7 concentration, suggesting that this decrease reflected the interaction of NP molecules with H7. this result was derived by a Hill plot analysis. NP associates with viral RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid after the first 2 h. different concentrations of H7 were added to A549 cells after virus infection. matrix protein 1 (M1) viral RNA expression levels during replication were normalized based on the vehicle control (same volume of DMSO added at T2) upon H7 treatment at 15M, the M1 viral RNA synthesis in the influenza virus\u2013infected cells was reduced by 75% at T2. in the influenza virus\u2013infected cells as compared to the viral control was reduced by 20% upon H7 treatment. the results suggested that H7 can slow viral protein synthesis after the early stages of viral replication in virus-infected cells. kd values for RNA binding to Y148A, R150A, R152A, R152A, R156A, R156A, R175A, K184A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A were similar to that for WT. kd values for RNA binding to all mutants were larger than that of WT, suggesting these residues are likely important for RNA recognition and interaction. sample ka (M1 s1 104) kd(s1 104) KD(nM) WT 1.83 0.22 1.52 0.19 8.27 1.43 Y148F 1.30 0.07 2.07 0.19 15.87 1.74 Y148S 1.21 0.04 3.97 0.11 32.69 1.30 Y148R 1.82 0.10 1.67 0.66 9.14 3.65 Y148A 1.09 0.17 7.31 1.49 66.71 17.19. the kd values followed the order WT > Y148R > Y148F Y148S > Y148R > WT. the kd values increased in the following order: Y148A > Y148S > Y148F > Y148R > WT. CD spectra of H1N1 WT and mutant NPs showed similar intensities at approximately 205 and 220 nm, suggesting that they possessed a similar secondary structure composition upon RNA binding. Y148F, Y148S, Y148R, and Y148A showed a thermal denaturation midpoint at 73.5 \u00b0C as determined by CD. sample NP Tm (\u00b0C) NP + RNA Tm (\u00b0C) WT 73.5 77.4 3.9 Y148F 67.3 71.1 3.8 Y148R 72.8 75.3 2.5 Y148S 71.2 72.4 1.2 Y148A 70.1 72.3 2.2 We also characterized the stabilizing and structural effects of NP bound to RNA by CD melting analysis. potential hits with docking scores over 90 were analyzed based on their docking results. they all contain an aromatic core to stack onto Y148 of the NP. among the 40 potential hits, these seven compounds were readily available. only H7 decreased the RNA-binding capacity of NP by more than 10%. we also evaluated the kinetic association (ka) and dissociation constants (kd) to determine the effects of these compounds on the RNA-binding affinity toward NP. RNA-binding activity of NP by directly interacting with Y148 and R150. the average of three experiments is shown. the data are expressed as a percentage of the maximum fluorescence change. H7 inhibits influenza during the early stage of the virus replication cycle. NP associates with viral RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid after the first 2 h. different concentrations of H7 were added to A549 cells after virus infection. the effects of (E,E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (H7) on NP and M1 viral proteins expression. cells were mock-infected or infected with H1N1 for 8 h. NP is essentially conserved across various influenza virus strains. the area between the body and body domains is rich in conserved basic residues providing a scaffold for RNA binding. the tail loop region is involved in the oligomerization of NP26. 152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A mutants significantly decreased the rates of association between NP and RNA, suggesting these 10 residues play a crucial role in RNA binding. tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine, serine, and arginine. zanamivir and oseltamivir are commonly employed to treat influenza virus infections with minimal adverse effects. but recent studies have reported that the influenza virus has started to develop resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir. novel antiviral strategies are required to combat the drug-resistant influenza viruses. some small molecules targeting E339...R416 from virtual screening were shown to disrupt the formation of NP trimers and inhibit replication of WT and nucleozin-resistant strains35. the second strategy is to target the RNA-binding site, which contains several conserved residues21,25. the safety, tolerability, and nontoxicity of curcumin at high doses have been well established by human clinical trials. we developed two general guidelines for developing influenza virus NP-Y148 targeting agents. the recombinant NPs carrying an N-terminal 6His-tag were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient that ranged from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. purified NPs were analyzed by gel filtration with Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) and Coomassie blue staining. the stoichiometries of RNA to various NPs were calculated to be 0.8 1.3. the sensorgrams were fit to the 1:1 Langmuir model using the BIAevaluation software (version 3). a final concentration of 4 M NP was added to a buffer that contained various concentrations of compound. the buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl. the binding pocket of the Y148 of NP was represented by a set of spheres during the docking process. a total of 5 105 A549 cells were seeded into six-well plates, allowed to reach confluence, and then challenged with virus. western blotting The cell lysates were collected and lysed with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% CA630, 50 mM Tris-base, pH 8.0) for detecting the target proteins. blocking and incubation with antibodies were done using 0.05% Tween 20. the NP lacks a defined tertiary structure in the regions between amino acid residues 73\u201391, 397\u2013401, and 429\u2013437. we used the complete structure of the NP as a template to construct a plausible NP-ssRNA complex using the molecular modelling programs Discovery Studio 2.5 and HADDOCK39. the recombinant NPs carrying an N-terminal 6His-tag were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient that ranged from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. purified NPs were analyzed by gel filtration with Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) and Coomassie blue staining. the binding stoichiometries of RNA to various NPs are 1 to 1. the sensorgrams were fit to the 1:1 Langmuir model using the BIAevaluation software (version 3). a final concentration of 4 M NP was added to a buffer that contained various concentrations of compound. the buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl. the sample was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for various durations. human alveolar basal epithelial cells, A549 cells (ATCC accession no.
