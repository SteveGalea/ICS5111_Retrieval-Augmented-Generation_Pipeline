{"summary": "WNV is an enveloped, positive-strand flavivirus and is related to Zika virus, which is implicated in Guillain-Barre syndrome and neonatal microcephaly (1, 2). humans are a dead-end host for WNV. marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells or neurons revealed increased virus titers and decreased type I IFN production. marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells or neurons revealed increased virus titers and decreased type I IFN production in cells lacking MAVS expression. WNV strain TX 2002-HC (WNV-TX) was propagated as previously described (3). working stocks of WNV-TX were generated by a single round of amplification on Vero cells. 106 cells were persed and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Roche) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies were used for surface staining. 1 106 cells/well were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 5 to 6 h in the presence of 2.5 to 10 M peptide. cells were then labeled for cell surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti-intracellular cytokine/protein antibodies. cells were stained with E641 (PVGRLVTVNPFVSVA) tetramers for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. all flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSCalibur or BD FACSVerse. in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 7 after WNV infection. recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1,000 U/ml; BD Pharmingen) recombinant IL-4 (50 U/ml; eBioscience) after 6 days, the BMDCs were stimulated with 1 g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 h and further incubated with or without 1 M NS4B peptide for 2 h at the arrays were scanned with a HiScan bead array system. data from metrix Mouse gene 2.0 expression beadChip were normalized and median polished using Robust Multichip Average background correction. cells were cultured in the presence of 1 g of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb) after 66 h. cells were harvested and stained for CFSE dilution, caspases 3/7/8 (Invitrogen), and BCL-2 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells. survival data were analyzed using a Mantel-Cox log rank test. vero cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 PFU of WN-TX in 20 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS. mononuclear cells were collected from interphase, washed, and resuspended in culture medium. 106 cells/well were blocked with 1 g anti-CD16/32 antibody and 1% rat serum and stained with the indicated antibodies at 4\u00b0C. cells were labeled for cell surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti-intracellular cytokine/protein antibodies. the frequency of CD8 T cells producing IFN- at each concentration of peptide was measured. in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 7 after WNV infection. splenocytes from CD45.1 congenic naive Mavs/ and WT mice were stained with 2 M (Mavs/), 0.2 M (WT) or 0.004 M (1:1 WT-Mavs/) carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were then pulsed with the NS4B peptide (10 M after 6 days, the BMDCs were stimulated with 1 g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 h and incubated with or without 1 M NS4B peptide for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. mice were infected i.v. with BMDCs (5 105) in 200 l PBS. the significance of expression differences was assessed using a false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 and a 2-fold change. analysis and visualization of data and pathway analysis were performed using PartekGS software and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. a Student t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. survival data were analyzed using a Mantel-Cox log rank test. chimeric mice were infected with 100 PFU WNV s.c. survival was monitored daily (Mavs/ Mavs/, n = 10; Mavs/, n = 7; P = 0.0002) Bone marrow chimeras were generated as described in Materials and Methods. to obtain virus titers, brains and spleens were homogenized at the indicated time points. titers are expressed as PFU/g tissue. n = 5 or 6 mice/group/time point. *, P 0.05. a thousandfold more cells were detected at day 7 p.i.. a large fraction of cells from Mavs/ mice expressed both IFN- and IL-10. this large increase in T cell numbers suggested that greatly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine were present in the infected Mavs/ brain. brain cells were harvested at day 10 p.i. and stimulated with NS4B peptide (CD8 T cells) (E) or E641 peptide (CD4 T cells) (F) cells expressing IFN- and TNF, IL-10, or IL-2 are shown. cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 7 p.i. using CD8 T cell peptide (pep) NS4B-coated and control splenocytes. n = 3 mice/group/experiment. *, P 0.05; n.s., not significant. mice were immunized with NS4B peptide, followed by boosting at day 7 with vaccinia virus expressing the same epitope. this regimen effectively and rapidly induces memory T cells (16). however, challenge of Mavs/ mice with WNV at either 5 days or 5 weeks postboost was not protective. the frequencies of NS4B tetramer+ CD8 T cells are shown. Mavs/ and Myd88/ mice were infected with 100 PFU WNV s.c. at 5 days or 5 weeks postboosting. we transferred 6 105 WT or Mavs/ Tregs to infected Mavs/ mice. that number ameliorated disease in mice infected with another neurotropic virus. however, in neither case was lethality prevented. large increase in macrophage numbers in Mavs/ compared to WT brains. frequency of brain-infiltrating macrophages increased 10-fold and their number increased 100- to 1,000-fold by day 7 p.i. in Mavs/ compared to WT mice. cells from the brains were harvested at day 10 p.i. and stained for macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. the data were pooled from the results of three independent experiments. cells from brains were harvested at day 10 p.i. and stained with phenotypic markers. the data are representative of the results of 2 independent experiments. n = 3 mice/group/time point/experiment. RNA was prepared from CD45+ cells harvested from the brains of 4 Mavs/ and 4 WT mice at day 10 p.i. and analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. a total of 1,104 genes were differentially regulated in Mavs/ compared to WT mice. resident cells were most critical in preventing lethal disease. we performed a set of reciprocal bone marrow transfers, transferring Mavs/ or WT bone marrow to Mavs/ or WT recipients. we monitored the mice for clinical disease, inflammatory-cell infiltration, and virus clearance. Arrows denote indicated donor bone marrow transferred into indicated irradiated host. titers are expressed as PFU/g tissue. n = 5 or 6 mice/group/time point. *, P 0.05. a large fraction of T cells in the blood and peripheral lymphoid tissue were specific for single WNV-specific epitopes. nearly 50% of blood CD8 T cells responded to a Db-restricted NS4B CD8 T cell epitope (13) and 10% responding to an I-Ab-restricted E protein CD4 T cell epitope (14), as measured by MHC class I/peptide tetramer staining or peptide restimulation eight- to 12-week-old WT and Mavs/ mice were infected with 100 PFU WNV s.c. CD8 (A and B) and CD4 (C and D) T cells from peripheral lymphoid organs. brain cells were harvested at day 10 p.i. and stimulated with NS4B peptide (CD8 T cells) (E) or E641 peptide (CD4 T cells) (F) in vivo cytotoxicity assays were performed using NS4B peptide-pulsed splenocytes as target cells. n = 3 mice/group/experiment. *, P 0.05; n.s., not significant. NS4B-specific CD8 T cells from the brains of Mavs/ mice exhibited approximately 5-fold-lower functional avidity than brain cells harvested from WT mice. high-functional-avidity cells preferentially migrated to the brains of infected mice, but not Mavs/-infected mice. WT, Mavs/, and Myd88/ mice were immunized with BMDCs pulsed with NS4B peptide. seven days later, the mice were boosted with 1 106 PFU rVV-NS4B i.v. the frequencies of Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissue were similar at all times p.i. in Mavs/ and WT mice. Treg frequency in the blood, however, was greatly decreased in Mavs/ mice. in contrast, Treg frequency decreased only modestly in WT mice. survival was monitored daily (WT Treg, AT, n = 5; Mavs/ Treg, AT, n = 5). cells from brains and spleens were harvested at day 10 p.i. the frequencies of E641 tetramer+ cells in Foxp3- CD4 T cells and Foxp3+ Tregs are shown. cells from the brains were harvested at day 10 p.i. and stained for macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. n = 7 to 9 mice/group/time point. *, P 0.05. no differences in inflammatory cytokine expression were found in macrophages and microglia in uninfected brains of either Mavs/ or WT mice. the results thus far showed that there was more infiltration of activated myeloid and T cells in Mavs/ than in WT brains. RNA was prepared from brain-derived CD45+ cells harvested from 4 mavs/ and 4 mavs/ mice at day 10 p.i. 620 genes increased in expression in Mavs/ mice compared to WT mice. a smaller number (484) reduced in expression compared to WT mice. hematopoietic cells express MAVS-dependent expression of type I interferon and other inflammatory molecules by macrophages. in the absence of MAVS expression, type I IFN and other proinflammatory mediators are probably produced by other cells via MAVS-independent pathways. however, prolonged and elevated virus titers elicit a protracted innate immune response in both the periphery and brain (3). a downstream consequence of increased virus load and overexuberant proinflammatory cytokines is massive infiltration of virus-specific T cells and CD11b+ Ly6C+ myeloid cells into the brain and microglion activation. there were no intrinsic differences in the ability to proliferate between MAVS/ and WT T cells because proliferation was approximately the same after CD3 stimulation in vitro. Tregs were detected in both mavs/ and WT brains at day 5 p.i. but their numbers failed to increase in MAVS/ mice while they increased in WT mice as infection progressed. it is also possible that Tregs may not function optimally in the highly inflamed CNS of WNV-infected Mavs/ mice."}
