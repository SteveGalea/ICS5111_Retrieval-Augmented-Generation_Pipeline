{"summary": "the protocol was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig faeces. the genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. about 191 million pigs are kept in Europe as farm animals. viruses directly affecting the pig health have a great impact on food production in general. pigs are a natural habitat for zoonotic viruses, which can cause infectious diseases in humans. the protocols used for the analysis of the composition of the intestinal viral community generally consist of four basic steps: (i) purification and concentration of the virus particles present in the faeces, (ii) extraction of nucleic acids, (iii) deep sequencing of the nucleic acid and (iv) bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data. three bacteriophages (T4, M13, MS2) were used as process control. bacteriophages are easy to propagate and do not need extensive safety containment. 1.4 reads 29 137 175 contigs / 4 5 average contig size 647 694 1 ssDNA \u2013 single-stranded DNA; dsDNA \u2013 double-stranded DNA; ssRNA \u2013 single-stranded RNA Table 2. a prolonged centrifugation time for removal of larger debris resulted in a marked loss of bacteriophage T4, whereas bacteriophages M13 and MS2 were less affected. however, further processing of the sample by TFF without prior centrifugation was not practicable because of the appearance of filter occlusions. a shorter centrifugation of three hours was used, although this might result in some loss of virus particles with high densities. the optimized method contains an amplification step at the end of the procedure. the yield of nucleic acids was too low for direct use in deep sequencing. aliquots were taken from different PCR cycles to determine the minimum amplification needed. total number of reads 69,613 number of reads included in analysis 66,129 average read length (bp) 250 total

1). 4% single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses, 6.0% dsRNA viruses, 13.5% ssRNA viruses and 4.2% unknown genome types were detected. the most abundant virus families were Siphoviridae (30.1%), Microviridae (21.7 %) and Myoviridae (11.3%), all representing bacteriophages. the numbers of generated viral sequences are analysed according to virus host (A), viral genome type (B) or assignment to a specific virus family (C) in the latter case, the numbers have been corrected according to the genome length of the respective virus species. the numbers have been corrected according to the genome length of

because of filter occlusions. a shorter centrifugation of three hours was used, although this might result in some loss of viruses with high densities. treatment with bacteriophage MS2 led to a significant decrease in the detectable genome number of bacteriophage MS2. the RNA was no longer detectable by qRT-PCR after 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature. the optimized method contains an amplification step at the end of the procedure. the yield of nucleic acids was too low for direct use in deep sequencing. faeces of five 35 day-old male pigs were pooled and subjected to

identified as plant virus sequences. 56 reads (1.4%) could not be classified into one of these groups. the most abundant viral families were Microviridae (bacteriophages, 45.9%) followed by the Chimpanzee stool associated circular ssDNA virus (ChiSCV, 12.0%) and Picornaviridae (mammalian viruses, 10.8%) the Shannon index was used to assess the diversity of the sequences detected in the

and C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus, picobirnavirus, teschovirus, picornavirus, and the DNA viruses: circovirus, bocavirus, pox virus, parvovirus and herpesvirus. a novel virus showing sequence identity to ChiSCV was detected and analysed in detail. a total of 6 ORFs encoding proteins consisting of more than 100 amino acids were identified. the protein encoded by ORF1 shows the highest amino acid sequence identity (27.0%) to the replicase protein (Rep) of ChiSCV. the genome organization of PigSCV is different from that of ChiSCV. a search for repetitive sequences revealed a short stemloop sequence between nucleotide positions 743 and 759 on the PigSCV genome. however, within this group, the PigSCV sequence forms a separate branch indicating a membership of this virus to a separate species. the highest detection rate was found in the pigs at 33 and 35 days of age. the PigSCV genome was not detected in serum samples derived from pigs at 42 days of age. control consists of a set of previously characterized viruses, of which a defined number is added to the sample. the process control should reflect the variety of viruses with different morphologies and genome types, which can be suspected to be present in the sample. some techniques are more effective than others. one refers to the use of an RNase digestion step to remove contaminating free RNA from the virus particle suspension. a second decision refers to the use of amplification steps after preparation. 99% of the mammalian viruses were RNA viruses, similar to 96% obtained in our study. coronavirus was only found by Shan et al. [22] and rotavirus was only detected in our study. many sequences with relative low deduced amino acid sequence identities were included in the analysis (Tab. 5). however, it has to be considered that the analysis of deduced amino acid sequences may not be appropriate in case of sequences representing non-coding regions of viral genomes. id proteins of the chimpanzee virus have not yet been described in pigs. it is concluded that it represents a novel pig virus. the different pattern of virus excretion in pigs receiving the same feed argues against an origin of the virus from infected plants that were ingested. the established protocol enables the efficient analysis of the virus content in pig faeces including the identification of new viruses. the high percentage of bacteriophages detected in the faecal sample suggests an important function of these viruses in the modulation of the bacterial intestinal community. M13 and T4 were propagated on E. coli JM110 (New England BioLabs GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany), MS2 on E. coli strain Top10 F+ (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) for quantification, the phage titer of lysates was determined as previously described. approximately 100 g of pig faeces were resuspended in 1,000 ml SM-buffer by magnetic stirring. 1107 plaque-forming units of each bacteriophage were added to the suspension. the sample was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 30 min to remove large particulate debris and the supernatant was collected. a second TFF was performed using a 0.22 m filter (PALL Corporation, Middleton; MA, USA 500 l CsCl purified virus suspension were treated with 25 units DNase I (2,000 U/mg, bovine pancreas grad II; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) the extracted nucleic acids (75 ng per reaction) were randomly primed for cDNA synthesis using the transPlex\u00ae Complete Whole Transcriptom Amplification Kit (WTA2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) sequence reads subjected to amplification primer/adaptor trimming using seqMan. all primary reads were subjected to de novo contig assembly using the 454 Newbler Assembler [44] software. criteria of 90% minimum overlap identity and a minimum overlap length of 40 nt. the long range PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used with primers PigSCV-1s (5\u2032-CCA ATC AGA TTC ACG CTT ACC G-3\u2032) or primers PigSCV-2s (5\u2032-GGG CCA CGC ATG AAC CTT CC-3\u2032) and PigSCV-2as (5\u2032-ACC ATT GAA ATC TGG GAT G-3\u2032) PCR was performed by an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles each including 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec. a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. a fresh pooled faecal sample (approximately 100 g) was derived from five 35 day-old male pigs housed in one pen of the experimental animal facility. quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were established. the bacteriophages T4 and M13 have DNA genomes. the titer of lysates was determined as previously described. 1107 plaque-forming units of each bacteriophage were added to the suspension. the sample was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 30 min to remove large particulate debris and the supernatant was collected. a second TFF was performed using a 0.22 m filter (PALL Corporation, Middleton; MA, USA) to concentrate the virus particles. min at 37\u00b0C followed by heat inactivation for 10 min at 65\u00b0C. extracted nucleic acids (75 ng per reaction) were randomly primed for cDNA synthesis. annealing temperature decreased to 40\u00b0C (cycles 1 and 2) and 45\u00b0C (cycles 3 and 4) to enable simultaneous amplification of DNA and RNA. d to de novo contig assembly using the 454 Newbler Assembler software. criteria of 90% minimum overlap identity and a minimum overlap length of 40 nt. tBLASTx [45] and CLC Main Workbench 6.2 were used against a local database.
