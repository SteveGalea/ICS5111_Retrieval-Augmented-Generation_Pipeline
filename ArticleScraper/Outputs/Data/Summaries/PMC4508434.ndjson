{"summary": "TEXT Coronaviruses (CoVs) have repeatedly crossed species barriers. some have emerged as important human pathogens (1, 2). human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 predominantly cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) frequently cause severe pneumonia with a number of single nucleotide mismatches at different positions included in the upE assay forward primer and probe have been detected in recent strains of MERS-CoV. we hypothesize that additional gene targets may be suitable for design of RT-PCR assays for coVs and would increase molecular diagnosis for circulating and emerging CoV infections. a total of 229 fresh or frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates were provided by the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital. a total of 229 fresh or frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between 1 January 2012 and 31 October 2014. the most abundantly expressed sequence in the MERS-CoV genome was determined by small RNA-Seq data analysis. the mapping analysis revealed that most of these small RNA sequence reads matched the 67-nucleotide leader sequence at the 5\u2032 terminus of the genome. the other peaks at the ORF1a, S, and N gene regions accounted for 3.0% of the mapped small RNA sequence reads. the percentages of mapped small RNA sequence reads at the leader sequence, ORF1a, S, and N gene regions are quantified and shown. the percentages of mapped small RNA sequence reads at the leader sequence, ORF1a, S, and N gene regions are quantified and shown. to overcome the relatively short length of the leader sequences, we employed LNA probes (Exiqon, Copenhagen, Denmark) to develop novel real-time RT-PCR assays for these Primer and probe sequences of CoV real-time RT-PCR assays with LNA probes in the present studya Assayb Genome target Nucleotide position in genome Primer/probe Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) GenBank accession no. lowercase letters represent the additional bases added which are not from the original genome sequence. the bridge \u201clocks\u201d the ribose in the 3\u2032-endo (north) conformations and significantly increases the hybridization properties of the probe. the ORF1b assay for MERS-CoV has the least optimal limit of detection of 64 RNA copies/reaction (13, 14) our assays showed no cross-reactivity among the individual CoVs and with other common respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses. results for four ResPlex-II HCoV-negative specimens concurred with their CoV real-time RT-PCR assay results. results suggest that our assays are highly sensitive and specific and not inferior to ResPlex-II for the detection of HCoVs in vitro and in clinical samples.
