{"summary": "a total of 26,277 EVD cases and 10,884 EVD-related deaths were reported from December 2013 to April 29, 2015. the spread of the EVD outbreak was overwhelming and posed a serious threat to public health in Africa due to the high infection rate of EVD. in a previous study, researchers constructed an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infective, removed) model to analyze the 1995 EVD outbreak in the Congo. a dynamic transmission model can be applied to the analysis of EVD outbreaks. the results may aid in predicting epidemiological trends, evaluating the effectiveness of intervention measures, and providing scientific evidence for improving the control and prevention of EVD. the equilibrium points for s, i, and r were found to be 58.5%, 0.1%, and 41.1%, respectively, in Guinea, 54.6%, 0.1%, and 45.3%, respectively, in Liberia, and 49.5%, 0.1%, and 50.4%, respectively, in Sierra Leone. the model indicates that if there were no EVD outbreak control or prevention measures in place, EVD would first re-emerge in 2035, and then s and i values would oscillate periodically around dynamic equilibrium points. periods between oscillations would shorten, and amplitudes would decrease gradually. the cumulative number of EVD cases predicted without isolation of close contacts was 37%. a new case every other day has a strong effect on amplitude relative to zero case importation (red) the number of predicted EVD cases could be decreased by shortening the interval between death and corpse decontamination. reduction of the interval between a person\u2019s death and clearing of the corpse to less than 3 days could have reduced the cumulative number of cases by 19% (2 day interval), 34% (1 day interval), or as much as 41% (0.5 day interval) through may 31st, 2015. early detection, diagnosis, and isolation can decrease the total number of EVD cases in an open environment, and early treatment can increase the EVD survival rate. cases imported from other countries on the epidemic trend of EVD. the number of new EVD cases at the peak of the epidemic curve would be 1.6 times higher than in the absence of any imported cases. sensitivity analysis was conducted with 15 parameters and a continuous time-series for confirmed and suspected cases. the net growth threshold values for the epidemic in Guinea (0.95), liberia (1.01), and Sierra Leone (0.90) were all close to 1.0. the equilibrium points for s, i, and r were found to be 58.5%, 0.1%, and 41.1%, respectively, in Guinea, 54.6%, 0.1%, and 45.3%, respectively, in Liberia, and 49.5%, 0.1%, and 50.4%, respectively. s and i values would oscillate periodically around dynamic equilibrium points. periods between oscillations would shorten, and amplitudes would decrease gradually. WHO has reported numbers of EVD cases and deaths due to EVD. by may 31st, 2015, the cumulative number of EVD cases predicted without isolation of close contacts was 37% greater than the predicted number with isolation. Fig 4. Effects of control and prevention measures on EVD epidemic trends. reduction of the interval between death and corpse decontamination could have reduced the cumulative number of cases by 19% (2 day interval), 34% (1 day interval), or as much as 41% (0.5 day interval) through may 31st, 2015. early detection, diagnosis, and isolation can decrease the total number of EVD cases in an open environment. if 0.5 cases were being imported from the uncontrolled outside environment daily, then the number of new EVD cases at the peak of the epidemic curve would be 1.6 times higher than that in the absence of any imported cases. this finding indicates that imported cases can contribute substantially to EVD epidemic trends. in the 2014 epidemic, most of the early EVD cases were located in the sparsely populated rural areas. patients came into contact with more susceptible individuals, causing the I value to increase. if the disease spread to urban areas, patients came into contact with more susceptible individuals, causing the I value to increase. EVD epidemics may break out periodically, though the disease will reach a dynamic equilibrium point with a shorter period between epidemics of progressively weaker intensity. early detection, diagnosis, and isolation are critical for controlling EVD outbreaks. if imported cases do reach a country, an epidemic can still be prevented by rapidly implementing control and prevention measures. EVD cases were controlled successfully due to the timely isolation of cases and careful monitoring of close patient contacts. the WHO data are the most accurate data available at present. the model fit and forecast epidemic trends accurately, evaluated the effects of control and prevention measures. the number of infected persons in the next generation will be less than 1 if at least R01 infected persons of the next generation were vaccinated, resulting in a termination of a pandemic. the minimum vaccination rate of the population can be expressed as follows: p v = R 0 1 R 0 = 1 1 R 0 A detailed derivation of the above formula is published elsewhere [31]. s, i, and r have a single dynamic equilibrium point of P0(1,0,0), and the system is asymptotically stable. the calculation result ( = 1.85), when the three countries are pooled into a single region, indicates the presence of a positive dynamic equilibrium point. the net growth threshold of the population was considered to analyze the trend of the total population N when b>d and >1. people in S status can transfer to I or U status (suspected cases) to accept treatment and be isolated. some people in the S block who are not infected, but present with EVD-like symptoms are transferred to the U block. blocks U, P, and Q denote suspected cases in isolation, confirmed cases in isolation, and close contacts in isolation. blocks H, R, K, and A indicate the medical staff in charge of U and P, recovered patients that are still infectious and with immunity. ipII is subtracted from f(I,D,R) denotes the number of new suspected cases (non-EVD infection) when a new confirmed case is reported. k represents the probability of a susceptible person being infected through close contact with a patient with EVD.
