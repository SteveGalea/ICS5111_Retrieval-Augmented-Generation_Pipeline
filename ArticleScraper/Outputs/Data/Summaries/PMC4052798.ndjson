{"summary": "background human rhinoviruses are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold and cause billions of USD annually. an assessment was made of the cytotoxic and antiviral activities and possible mode of action of the tannin ellagic acid from the leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa toward HeLa cells. human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (Picornaviridae) are the most frequent cause of mild upper respiratory tract infection, or common cold. they are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold. HRVs are also associated with more severe diseases such as acute otitis media in children [3] and sinusitis in adults [4] a methanol extract from the leaves of Giant Crape-myrtle (called banaba in the Phillippines) showed good antiviral activity toward HRV-4. the plant leaves possess antidiabetic and hypoglycemic [15], antiobesity [16], antioxidant [17], antigout [18], antiinflammatory [19], and antibacterial activities [20]. Silica gel 60 (0.063\u20130.2 mm) was used for column chromatography. Merck precoated silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.20 mm) were used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) ribavirin was supplied by Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo) all of the other chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade quality and available commercially. human rhinovirus serotypes and cell line HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), a human epithelial adenocarcinoma cervix cell line, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. filtrate was concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation at 40\u00b0C. the extract (100 g) was sequentially partitioned into hexane- (9.35 g), ethyl acetate- (14.4 g), butanol- (39.35 g) and water-soluble (36.9 g) portions for subsequent bioassay. active methanol-soluble fraction was separated by a TLC plate developed with n-BuOH/HOAc/H2O to give an active fraction (45 mg, Rf = 0.12) for further separation of the constituents from the active fraction, a high-performance liquid chromatography was performed. an active principle was isolated at a retention time of 2.61 min. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz): 7.47 (2H, s, ArH) 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz): 107.7, 110.2, 112.2, 136.2, 136.2, 139.5, 147.9, 159.0. Figure 1. Cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of fractions obtained from solvent partitionings of the methanol extract. the antiviral activity of L. speciosa leaf-derived materials toward three HRVs tested was evaluated by the SRB method using CPE reduction [22,23]. the plates were seeded onto a 96-well microtiter plate at a concentration of 3 104 cells per well for 1 day. the culture medium was then removed, and the plates were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) negative controls consisted of the DMSO solution. negative controls consisted of the DMSO solution. the time-of-addition effects of ellagic acid were tested according to the method of Choi et al. [23]. monolayers of HeLa cells were seeded onto a 96-well microtiter plate. the qPCR conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and then 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. the CC50 and IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) epithelial adenocarcinoma cervix cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) the cell line was maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% antibiotic-antimycotic in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (10 g) was most biologically active. chromatographed on a 70 5.5 cm silica gel (600 g) column by elution. column fractions were monitored by TLC on silica gel plates developed with chloroform and methanol. an active principle (35 mg) was isolated at a retention time of 2.61 min. the mass spectrum exhibited a molecular ion at m/z 302 [M]+ and IR absorption at 3380, 1720, and 1690\u20131610 cm-1 indicates the presence of phenolic hydroxyl, -pyrone C = O, and benzonoid C = C groups, respectively. the Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf methanol extract was sequentially partitioned into hexane-, ethyl acetate-, butanol-, and water-soluble portions. for isolation of active principles from the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction, viral inhibition assay toward HRV-4 in HeLa cell was used. 100 L of 0.057% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid solution was added to each well. plates were left in a dry oven for 1 day. negative controls consisted of the DMSO solution. infected cells were seeded onto a 96-well microtiter plate as stated previously. the culture medium was removed and the plates were replaced with media containing different concentrations of the test materials in DMSO. cytotoxicity of the test materials to HeLa cells was evaluated using a SRB assay. RT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) each reaction mixture consisted of 10 L of Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (2) (thermo Scientific, Foster, CA) assay ID DQ473490.1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. mRNA expression level of target gene was normalized to mRNA expression level for the housekeeping gene 2-microglobulin. natural ellagic acid was 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 times more toxic toward HRV-2 (IC50, 38 g/mL), HRV-3 (31 g/mL), and HRV-4 (29 g/mL) than ribavirin. ellagic acid and ribavirin were >100 g/mL toward human rhinovirus-4 in a sulforhodamine B bioassay. inhibition rates of preincubation with 50 g/mL ellagic acid and 100 g/mL ribavirin were 17 and 5.7% respectively. continuous presence of ellagic acid and ribavirin during infection led to a significant increase in the inhibition rate. g/mL ribavirin on HRV-4 infection occurred between 0 and 6 h. the 50 g/mL EA and 100 g/mL RN were added at various times preinfection (-1 h), coinfection (0 h), or postinfection (1, 2, 4, and 6 h) of human rhinovirus-4 (HRV-4) was remarkably inhibited in the cell cultures treated with 50 g/mL ellagic acid (EA) natural ellagic acid, commercial pure ellagic acid, and ribavirin were significantly different from each other toward HRV-2 (F = 72.17; df = 2, 6; P 0.0001), HRV-3 (F = 134.26; df = 2, 6; P 0.0001), and HRV-4 (F = 81.32; df = 2, 6; P 0.0001). CC50 of ellagic acid and ribavirin 1.1b >2.4 30 2.4b >3.3 29 1.7b >3.4 Ribavirin >100 70 4.9a >1.4 71 0.5a >1.4 63 5.6a >1.6 Means within a column followed by the same letter are not significantly different. the effects of ellagic acid and ribavirin on the infectivity of HRV-4 particles were likewise examined. treatment with 50 g/mL ellagic acid significantly suppressed HRV infection only when added just after the virus inoculation (0 h) the inhibition rate of ellagic acid declined to 20% or less when added at either prior (-1 h) or post (1, 2, 4, and 6 h) infection. the inhibitory effect of 100 g/mL ribavirin on HRV-4 replication occurred between 0 and 6 h. HRV RNA expressions were normalized to the constitutive expression of mRNA of the housekeeping gene 2-microglobulin (B2M) each bar represents the mean SD of duplicate samples of three independent experiments. the plant grows widely in tropical countries, including the Philippines, India, Malaysia, China, and Australia. the antiviral principle was determined to be the tannin ellagic acid. the constituent exhibited antiviral activity toward both group A and group B (HRV-3 and HRV-4) materials derived from L. speciosa leaves can hold promise for development of novel and effective naturally occurring antiviral agents for two different HRV groups. ellagic acid was reported to possess anti-HIV activity, through inhibition of HIV protease. detailed tests are needed to understand the anti-HRV mode of action of ellagic acid. the antiviral action of ellagic acid may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of L. speciosa. tests, analyzed data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript. YJA evaluated the results and wrote the final draft of the manuscript."}
