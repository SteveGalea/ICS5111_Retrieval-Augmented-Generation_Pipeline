{"summary": "the virus causes respiratory disease, abortion, and neurological disorders, resulting in serious economic losses for the pig industry worldwide (2). the virus is a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, which also includes several human pathogens. PRV infection causes a severe pruritus called the \u201cmad itch\u201d followed by peracute death. mice infected with wild-type virulent PRV develop a severe pruritus only in the skin of the infected dermatome, resulting in self-mutilation and rapid death of the animals with no detectable behavioral CNS pathology. the innate immune system acts as a first line of defense by initiating an inflammatory response to prevent spread of viral infections. the main challenge is to ensure that the inflammation is resolved, homeostasis restored, and viral replication contained with little damage to the host. an uncontrolled inflammatory response often leads to a damaging systemic inflammation also known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that can be fatal for the host (20) we used the footpad inoculation model that has been widely used to study alphaherpesvirus infection of PNS separately from CNS infection. infection travels a greater distance from the periphery to the PNS and CNS neurons via the sciatic nerve. as a result, it is possible to obtain a more accurate assessment of the immunopathological processes associated with development of pruritus. PRV-Becker-infected mice began showing clinical signs at around 70 to 72 hpi. by 82 hpi, all PRV-Becker-inoculated mice showed constant tremors in the inoculated leg and distinctive PRV symptoms. by 200 hpi, the animals showed significant decrease in body weight (P 0.05) and behavioral CNS symptoms (the humane endpoint) all tissues, except the footpad and DRGs, showed no histopathological changes. PRV-Becker-infected foot sections revealed epidermal necrosis and severe dermal inflammation (edema and fibrin) PRV-Becker-infected DRGs showed minimal neuronal necrosis and mixed inflammation in all three infected mice. the mixed inflammation infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and lymphocytes. all DRGs of the three control and three PRV-Bartha-infected mice were normal. PRV-Bartha loads were detected only in the foot, DRGs, spinal cord, and brain at 200 hpi. no detectable PRV genomes were found in other tissues of PRV-Becker- or PRV-Bartha-infected mice. the plasma levels of 2 proinflammatory chemokines (Gro-1 and MCP-1) were significantly higher in PRV-Becker infected mice compared to control and PRV-Bartha infected animals (P 0.01) at 200 hpi, no detectable amount of any of the cytokines and chemokines tested above was observed in the plasma of PRV-Bartha-infected mice. the concentration is expressed in pg per ml (n = 5 per group) a significant increase in all four inflammatory markers was detected only at 82 hpi in the plasma of PRV-Becker-infected mice compared to controls. IL-6 levels were significantly increased in all tissues compared to controls at 82 hpi. significant G-CSF levels were detected only in the footpad, DRGs, spinal cord, brain, heart and liver of PRV-Becker-infected mice. at 82 hpi, we found that PRV-Becker-infected mice had significantly higher plasma levels of CRP (10.3 2.4 mg/liter) compared to PRV-Bartha-infected or control animals. this result suggests that PRV-induced systemic inflammation is a hyperacute process in mice. PRV-Becker-infected mice showed clinical signs at around 70 to 72 hpi. by 82 hpi, all PRV-Becker-inoculated mice showed constant tremors. by 200 hpi, the animals showed significant decreases in body weight (P 0.05) and behavioral CNS symptoms. PRV-Becker infection induces a massive neutrophil infiltration in the inoculated footpad and inflammation in the DRGs. at 82 hpi, all tissues, except the footpad and DRGs, showed no histopathological changes. the results are representative of three biological replicates for a given type of tissue. black arrows indicate representative areas of inflammation with immune cell infiltration. the mixed inflammation infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and lymphocytes. PRV-Bartha DNA was found only in the footpad (4 102 PFU/mg of tissue) at that time. at 200 hpi, a significantly higher PRV-Bartha load was detected in the DRGs (8.4 103 PFU/mg of tissue), spinal cord (1.57 104 PFU/mg of tissue) the PRV-Bartha loads were comparable in the footpad at 82 and 200 hpi. 12 proinflammatory cytokines and 6 proinflammatory chemokines tested at 82 hpi. plasma levels of 2 proinflammatory chemokines were significantly higher in PRV-Becker infected mice compared to control and PRV-Bartha infected mice. at 200 hpi, no detectable amount of any of the chemokines was observed in the plasma of PRV-Becker-infected mice. the concentration is expressed in pg per ml (n = 5 per group) the concentration is expressed in pg per ml (n = 5 per group) the concentration is expressed in pg per ml (n = 5 per group) local cytokine production is a significant indicator for disease pathogenesis or progression. it should provide additional information for monitoring the pathological events in a target tissue. IL-6 levels were significantly increased in all tissues compared to controls at 82 hpi (P 0.05) plasma level of CRP was measured by ELISA in PRV-Becker-infected mice at 82 hpi. the plasma level of CRP was measured by ELISA in PRV-Becker-infected mice. this result suggests that PRV-induced systemic inflammation is a hyperacute process in mice. PRV-Becker infection induces high plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and G-CSF, as well as the proinflammatory chemokines Gro-1 and MCP-1, at 82 hpi (moribund stage) this is consistent with the hypothesis that PRV-Becker infection induces a systemic inflammatory response when the animals are moribund. IL-6 is produced following pathogen stimulation in the initial stage of the inflammation. this cytokine influences the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of all cells in the neutrophil lineage. this cytokine influences the migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium (49). a previous study showed that PRV-induced systemic inflammation is a hyperacute process that could possibly lead to heart failure in mice. a previous study showed that PRV-induced systemic inflammation is a hyperacute process that could possibly lead to heart failure in mice. neutrophils migrate to the infected footpad and ipsilateral DRGs at 82 hpi. all of these signs were absent in the tissues of PRV-Becker-infected mice. neutrophils represent around 60% of the circulating white blood cells in most mammals. the early stages of this inflammatory process are likely to increase and propagate the inflammation and cause tissue damage. it would be interesting to assess the therapeutic efficacy of inhibitors of neutrophil recruitment, such as fucoidan, on the immunopathology of PRV in mice (62). interaction is responsible for the initiation of the uncontrolled inflammatory response in infected mice. we detected PRV-Becker DNA in the footpad, DRG neurons, spinal cord, and brain at the latest time after infection just before death (82 hpi) there is a strong correlation of viral gene expression in the footpad and DRG neurons and inflammation in PRV-Becker-infected mice. we also found inclusion bodies indicative of viral replication in pockets of inflammation in DRGs. newly made PRV particles in infected neurons were transported back in axons to the glands where the infection was initiated. we found that the PRV-Becker-inoculated footpad had epidermal necrosis at 82 hpi. the epidermis layer did not regenerate to support efficient viral replication. infection by PRV-Becker spreads faster from the footpad to the brain than does infection by PRV-Bartha (68) it is well known that PRV-Becker can spread both in the retrograde and anterograde directions. newly replicated virions cannot spread to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord from the infected DRG because there is no anterograde sorting and spread. both PRV-Becker and Bartha DNA could be detected only in the mouse footpad and nervous system and not in other organs. we identified IL-6 and G-CSF as two cytokines that play crucial roles in the regulation of this process. mice were anesthetized with 1 to 3% isoflurane gas. the right hind footpads were gently abraded about 20 times. a 20-l droplet of virus inoculum containing 8.106 PFU of PRV-Becker or 108 PFU of PRV-Bartha was applied on the abraded area of the skin. mice were kept under anesthesia for 30 min until the abraded footpad was dry. for clinical evaluation, mice were scored daily for symptoms of virulent PRV infection. tissues were disrupted using a TissueLyser (Qiagen) using 20 cycles/s for 2 min, followed by a 1-min wait, and 20 cycles/s for 2 min. samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 g and 4\u00b0C to separate cells from plasma and then for 15 min at 2,000 g and 4\u00b0C to deplete platelets. levels were collected for histopathological analyses. samples were processed and embedded in paraffin. sections were evaluated for signs of inflammation and epidermal and neuronal necrosis. qRT-PCR was performed with an Eppendorf RealPlex Mastercycler. the reaction mixture was prepared using a Kapa Syber Fast qPCR kit. each experiment was performed in duplicates. the normality of the residuals was verified by the use of the Shapiro-Wilk test. a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Mann-Whitney post hoc test was performed. values in the text, graphs, and figure legends throughout the manuscript are means the standard deviation. mice were anesthetized with 1 to 3% isoflurane gas. the right hind footpads, between the heel and walking pads, were gently abraded about 20 times with an emery board until the stratum corneum was removed. mice were weighed daily for symptoms of virulent PRV infection. mice were kept under anesthesia for 30 min until the abraded footpad was dry. mice were placed in separate cages for further analysis. a sterile steel bead (Qiagen) and 500 l of modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 M NaCl, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and protease cocktail inhibitor tablets (cOmplete Mini EDTA-free;
