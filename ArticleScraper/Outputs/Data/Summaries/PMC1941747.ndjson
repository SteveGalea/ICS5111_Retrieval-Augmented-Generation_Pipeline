{"summary": "live viral vaccines consist of attenuated, replication-competent viruses that are believed to be superior in the induction of broad immune responses. the recent proceedings in the area of virus reverse genetics allows for the rational design of recombinant vaccines by targeting, i.e., viral pathogenicity factors. for coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has been identified. effective vaccines controlling virus spread and disease are available for a number of infections, such as smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B [9,10]. despite their documented efficacy, it is still not understood why and how successful vaccines work [10,14]. nsp1 is encoded by all mammalian coronaviruses known to date. nsp1 is encoded by all mammalian coronaviruses known to date. a reverse genetics approach suggests functional similarities to mouse hepatitis. nsp1 mutants encoding a deletion in nsp1 replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cell culture, but displayed an unprecedented degree of attenuation in mice. nsp1 mutants elicited efficient memory cytotoxic T cell responses and protected against homologous and heterologous virus infections. nsp1 of group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) may belong to different protein families. reporter gene expression from all tested promoters was not affected when C-terminally truncated MHV nsp1 molecules were tested. induction compared to that of control plasmid-transfected cells (control) 293 cells were transfected with pRL-SV40 and indicated expression plasmids. results represent the mean SD of at least four independent experiments. the replicase gene is comprised of open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b. the 99-nt deletion within the nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp199 is illustrated. the arrowhead indicates the nsp1/nsp2 cleavage site. MHV-nsp199 showed no significant growth defect in primary pAPCs. deletion in nsp1 Confers Strong Attenuation In Vivo MHV-A59 is a hepatotropic and neurotropic virus that can cause acute hepatitis and encephalitis. MHV-nsp199 was not detectable in other non-hematopoietic organs. mice infected with wild-type virus showed acute liver disease with elevated liver enzyme values in serum. a significant weight loss that peaked at approximately 10%\u201315% at day 4 was observed. MHV-nsp199 is strongly attenuated in vivo, but has retained the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. mice were infected intraperitoneally (A\u2013E) or intracranially (F) with the indicated dose of MHV-nsp199 or MHV-A59. cDCs and pDCs were infected with MHV-nsp199 or wild-type MHV. both viruses elicited rapid and high IFN- production in pDCs. both wild-type and mutant MHV elicited only a late and weak IFN- production. arrow-derived (A) or primary (B) splenic cDCs or pDCs were infected with MHV-nsp199 or MHV-A59 at an MOI of 1. cells were treated with 50, 200, 500, or 1,000 U IFN-/100,000 cells. four hours later, cells were infected with MHV-nsp199 or MHV-A59. titers reached about 104\u2013105 pfu/g tissue in several organs after 36 h. nsp1 has a pivotal role in counteracting type I IFN host responses. liver damage was not yet detectable in MHV-nsp199\u2013infected mice. phenotypic analysis of MHV-nsp199 revealed a number of features that are advantageous for live attenuated vaccines. MHV-nsp199 grows to high titers in cell culture, infects pAPCs, replicates almost exclusively in secondary lymphoid organs, and is strongly attenuated in vivo. MHV-nsp199-GP33-GFP and MHV-GP33-GFP elicited strong CTL responses against both the H2-Db\u2013restricted GP33 and the H2-Kb\u2013restricted MHV S598 epitope. values in (A) represent the percentage SD of IFN-\u2013secreting CD8+ splenocytes were determined 8 d post immunization following short-term in vitro rest at 4 d post challenge, viral titers in spleens were determined. data in graph represent means SD from two pooled experiments with a total of eight mice per group. spleens were significantly reduced both in mice vaccinated with MHV-GP33-GFP and the attenuated MHV-nsp199-GP33-GFP virus. only 50 pfu of nsp1 mutant virus expressing the GP33 epitope were sufficient to achieve a reduction of LCMV titers by more than 4 orders of magnitude. sp1 of group 1 coronaviruses may belong to different protein families. reporter gene expression from all tested promoters was not affected. coronavirus nsp1 reduces cellular gene expression. 293 cells were transfected with pRL-SV40 and indicated expression plasmids. results represent the mean SD of at least four independent experiments. paired Student's t-test was performed using paired Student's t-test. the replicase gene is comprised of open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b. the 99-nt deletion within the nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp199 is illustrated. the arrowhead indicates the nsp1/nsp2 cleavage site. nsp1 is a hepatotropic and neurotropic virus that can cause acute hepatitis and encephalitis. after intraperitoneal infection, virus replication is first detectable in spleen and liver, followed by virus spread to other organs, including the central nervous system. MHV-nsp199 was not detectable in other non-hematopoietic organs. mice infected with wild-type virus showed acute liver disease with elevated liver enzyme values in serum. a significant weight loss that peaked at approximately 10%\u201315% at day 4 was observed. nsp199 is strongly attenuated in vivo, but has retained the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. pDCs are the major source of IFN- in early stages of MH. pDCs are the major source of IFN- in early stages of MH. cDCs and macrophages were infected with MHV-nsp199 or wild-type MHV. both viruses elicited rapid and high IFN- production in pDCs. nsp1 does not affect type I IFN- production in cDCs. s or pDCs were infected with MHV-nsp199 or MHV-A59. cells were treated with 50, 200, 500, or 1,000 U IFN-/100,000 cells. four hours later, cells were infected with MHV-nsp199 or MHV-A59. nsp1 has a pivotal role in counteracting type I IFN host responses. liver damage measured as alanine 2-oxoglutarate-aminotransferase (ALT) levels in serum was not yet detectable in MHV-nsp199\u2013infected IFNAR/ mice at 36 h p.i. phenotypic analysis of MHV-nsp199 revealed features that are advantageous for live attenuated vaccines.
