{"summary": "charcoal burning suicide victims have a unique sociodemographic profile. but little is known about the temporal patterns of charcoal burning suicides. a total of 1649 cases of charcoal burning suicide were analyzed using a two-step procedure. no prior research has examined the temporal pattern of suicides by charcoal burning. previous studies consistently showed asymmetrical distributions of suicide deaths. for both sexes, major peaks were found in late spring or summer. suicide rates are lower during the weekend than during the work week. employers may also experience a greater fear of job loss during seasonal layoff periods. unemployed may also have a higher suicide risk at specific times as a result of the stress of job searching. a total of 8165 suicide cases were reported during the overall study period. of these 5500 cases, 30.0% (1649 cases) were charcoal burning suicides. all of the recorded suicides included information on the age, sex, and economic activity status (working versus non-working) of the victim. the temporal variation was modeled by comparing the actual frequencies of suicides with the expected values. a significant IRR indicates that there is a significant difference in the adjusted suicide risk between the corresponding month (or day of the week) and the reference period of time. in the present study, the suicide risks for December and Saturday were used as references to examine the respective monthly and daily patterns of suicide. men were less likely to commit suicide in summer (June: IRR = 0.70, p = 0.0228; July: IRR = 0.73, p = 0.047) women were more likely to commit suicide in spring (April: IRR = 1.72, p = 0.0186 and May: IRR = 1.60, p = 0.0434), late autumn (November: IRR = 1.65, p = 0.0307), and winter (january: IRR = 1.97 a 70 deceased had unknown economic activity status. b 55 male deceased had unknown economic activity status. c 15 female deceased had unknown economic activity status. both sexes had peaks on Monday (Men: IRR = 1.64, p =.0001; Women: IRR = 1.61, p = 0.0113) women had an additional peak on Thursday (IRR = 1.57, p = 0.0176) incidence risk ratios of suicide for deceased aged 25\u201359 by day of the week. a total of 498 working men, 203 working women, 571 non-working men, and 307 non-working women were included in the analysis of the influence of economic activity status and sex on the temporal variation in charcoal burning suicides. men had a single peak on Monday (IRR = 1.45, p = 0.0222), whereas women had multiple peaks, on Monday (IRR = 1.65, p = 0.0429) and Tuesday (IRR = 1.81, p a 70 deceased had unknown economic activity status. b 55 male deceased had unknown economic activity status. c 15 female deceased had unknown economic activity status. men were less likely to commit suicide in summer (June: IRR = 0.57, p = 0.0148) women were more likely to commit suicide in late autumn (November: IRR = 1.85, p = 0.0319). daily patterns of suicides Significant temporal variations were observed in the daily patterns of charcoal burning suicides. a 70 deceased had unknown economic activity status. men had a single peak on Monday (IRR = 1.45, p = 0.0222), whereas women had multiple peaks on Monday (IRR = 1.81, p = 0.0154), and Thursday (IRR = 1.73, p = 0.026). a range of published studies have demonstrated that temporal variations in suicides are method-specific. this suggests that the specific suicide method is an important factor of suicide seasonality. previous studies have attributed the monthly patterns observed in suicide rates to the influence of seasonality-linked biological, psychosocial and meteorological correlates. charcoal burning suicide victims were less likely to be associated with psychiatric illness or substance abuse, compared with those who killed themselves using other methods [1-5]. the risk of charcoal burning suicide was found to be higher on weekdays (i.e., Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday) than on weekends. the influence of employment status on monthly and daily patterns of charcoal burning suicide differed considerably between men and women. it appears that economic activity status strengthens or weakens the magnitude of the temporal variations in charcoal burning suicide, rather than serving as a determinant that alters the temporal distribution. this may indicate that active employment only serves as a stabilizing factor that protects individuals from various life-threatening forms of behavior. the present study failed to separate the unemployed victims from the economically inactive victims due to the limited information available from the dataset. the employed and unemployed victims were expected to have similar variations in suicide risk. the unemployed and economically inactive victims were likely to commit suicide at different times [42]. the authors are indebted to Professor Paul Yip of the University of Hong Kong HKJC Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention. the Social Science Panel played no further role in the design of the study, the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, the writing of the report, or the decision to submit the paper for publication."}
