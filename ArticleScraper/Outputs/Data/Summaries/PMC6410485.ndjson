{"summary": "social distancing is the practice of restricting contact among persons to prevent the spread of infection. this study sought to identify key features of preparedness and the primary concerns of local public health officials in deciding to implement social distancing measures. we stratified sampling by population size: 200 000, 200 000-1 million, and >1 million persons. we contacted each of the 600 selected health departments by email. the individual contacted was the health department\u2019s emergency preparedness coordinator or the top executive. regression models with answers to 3 questions as dependent variables. we combined the 2 health-related concerns (public health impact and clinical implications) the 4 uncorrelated variables were chosen to represent relatively independent characteristics and because they tended to have lower rates of missing data than rates of other characteristics. logistic regression models used a 2-tailed test of significance, with.05 considered significant. results Of 600 health departments contacted, we received fully or mostly completed survey responses from 150 (25%) health departments. the median population size was 16% larger (269 721 vs 226 249) social distancing is the practice of restricting contact among persons to prevent the spread of infection. only 31 (21%) health departments reported having facilities. 10 (7%) had a line item in their budget for isolation or quarantine measures. public health impact 62 (41) Legal 15 (10) Political 12 (8) Vulnerable populations 12 (8) Financial 11 (7) Sociocultural 10 (7) Clinical implications 3 (2) Other 10 (7) No response 15 (10) a Social distancing is the practice of restricting contact among persons to prevent the spread of infection. the biggest health concerns about the use of social distancing were public health impact or clinical implications for half of the 135 departments responding to this question. population (in 100 000s) 0.97 (0.87-1.09).63 1.10 (0.96-1.25).18 0.98 (0.89-1.08).69 Percentage rural (in 10% increments) 0.91 (0.76-1.09).30 0.84 (0.72-0.98).03 1.10 (0.96-1.26).18 Border state (0 = no; 1 = yes) 2.34 (0.75-7.31).15 1.00 (0.32-3.08) >.99 1.87 (0.63-5.55 the biggest concern about implementing social distancing among most health departments was health related, specifically public health impact. for about half of the health departments, factors other than those listed were ranked as more important. planning for social distancing will result in decision making that is based more on public health implications than on other implications. survey used probability-based sampling and an intensive system of following up on potential respondents. nonresponders disproportionately came from smaller health departments. some questions were broad and may not have captured every factor."}
