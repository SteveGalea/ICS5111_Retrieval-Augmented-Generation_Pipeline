{"summary": "the term \u201czymogen\u201d refers to an inactive enzyme precursor that is converted to its active form following a biochemical modification, usually proteolytic processing. a sitoxin is comprised of an effector domain, a domain bearing an intracellular signaling moiety; and a polypeptidic sequence located between the effector domain and the domain bearing the intracellular signaling moiety. cleavage by the protease separates the effector domain of the sitoxin from the intracellular three-domain bacterial toxin kills mammalian cells by gaining entry to the cytosol and inactivating protein synthesis. domain 1a (a.a.1\u2013252) is the cell-binding domain that enables PE to reach the cytosol. diphtheria toxin (DT), produced by corynebacterium diphtheriae, kills mammalian cells in a mechanism similar to that of PE. the toxin is composed of three structural and functional domains: the amino terminal catalytic (C) domain (also known as \u201cDTA\u201d), the translocation domain (T) and the carboxy-terminal receptor binding (R) domain. cell-bound ricin is taken up by endocytosis. only a small fraction is eventually translocated by retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network, backward through the golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum and from there to the cytosol. NS3 is an extensively studied HCV protein that possesses multiple enzymatic activities that are essential for HCV replication. the N-terminus, in complex with its co-factor NS4A, primarily functions as a serine protease, which cleaves the viral polyprotein precursor downstream to NS3. chimeric toxins are based on a fusion between binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and NS3-activable modified catalytic domains of the bacterial or the plant toxins diphtheria toxin (DTA) and ricin toxin (RTA), respectively. the inhibitory domain is preceded by the NS5A/B junction sequence which cleavages the toxin from the inhibitory expression level of scNS3 in mammalian cells is greatly enhanced upon fusion of efficiently-expressed proteins (such as EGFP) to its N terminus. another construct was made, comprising a fusion of EGFP and the full length NS3 followed by full length NS4A (of the 1a HCV genotype) we constructed a substrate-encoding plasmid that encodes for a modification of our previously described polypeptide which serves as a substrate for proteolysis by the NS3 protease. this plasmid encodes for a fusion of maltose binding protein (MBP), enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), the 10 amino acid minimal NS3 cleavage sequence (P6-P4\u2032) from HCV NS5A/B site derived 105 cells inducibly expressing EGFP-scNS3 or EGFP-full NS3-4A were seeded on cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. after 12 hours, the cells were seeded on cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. a faint band, corresponding to the cleavage product, was also detected in a sample from uninduced cells. cells inducibly expressing EGFP-scNS3 were transfected with 2g of the plasmid pCMV/MBP-EGFP-NS5AB-CBD. after 24 hours, cells were treated with 1g/ml of tetracycline or left untreated. 24 hours later, cells were lysed and 20g protein from total cell extract. the construct was fused in its N terminus to the binding and translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) in order to enable internalization and trafficking to the cytosol of mammalian cells. a 6xHis tag followed by a KDEL ER retrieval signal were placed at the most C terminal portion of the construct (PE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin) protein sequences of the zymoxins described above, as well as all the zymoxins used in the study can be found in supporting Text S1. in-vitro cleavage by NS3: 600ng of each toxin were incubated with or without 500ng of recombinant MBP-scNS3 fusion. 50ng of each toxin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by anti-PE polyclo enzymatic activity of zymoxin is elevated following NS3 protease cleavage. an in-vitro cleavage reaction was carried out by incubating the chimeric toxins with recombinant mBP-scNS3 fusion produced in E. coli. incubation of the toxin \u201cPE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin\u201d resulted in a complete cleavage of the the uncleavable toxin basal activity was more potent than the basal activity of the non-cleaved cleavable toxin. the uncleavable toxin basal activity was more potent than the basal activity of the non-cleaved cleavable toxin (uninduced cells treated with \u201cPE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin\u201d) 3-4A were seeded in 96-well plates (4104 cells per well) after 9 hours, cells were treated with 1g/ml of tetracycline (+TET) or left untreated (NO TET) 2 hours later, cells were incubated for 72 hours with serial dilutions of the toxins \u201cPE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin\u201d or \u201cPE-DTA-mutated cleavage site-defensin\u201d ricin and Shiga-like toxin 1 (SLT-1), another type II ribosome-inactivating protein, were shown to inhibit the ribosome-inactivating function of SLT-1. a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the conserved C terminus of the ribosomal stalk proteins (EESEESDDDMGFGLFD) was shown to inhibit the ribosome-inactivating function of SLT-1. chimeric PE-RTA toxins are capable of penetrating into the mammalian cell cytoplasm. the enzymatic activity of RTA-based zymoxin is elevated following NS3 protease cleavage. an in-vitro cleavage reaction was carried out following by ribosome depurination assay using the \u201cacidic aniline\u201d method. in-vitro cleavage by NS3: 3000ng of each toxin were incubated with or without 1000ng of recombinant NS3 fusion. 250 ng of each toxin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by anti-PE polyclonal antibodies. the cleavage has led to an increase in ribosome depurination activity of the toxin. this fragment was undetectable when ribosomes were treated with the same concentration of non-cleaved cleavable toxin (cleavable toxin without incubation with NS3) or with the uncleavable toxin. this may result from the fact that the zymoxin is partially and not totally inhibited by the C- NS3 protease expression exhibiting only minor enhancement in cytotoxicity toward Tet-induced scNS3 expressing cells. T-Rex cells inducibly expressing scNS3 or full NS3-4A were seeded (4104 cells per well) after 9 hours, cells were incubated for 72 hours. T-Rex cells inducibly expressing full NS3-4A were seeded (2104 cells per well) in 96-well plates. after 24 hours, cells were supplemented with 1g/ml of tetracycline (+TET (1 microgram/ml), 0.01g/ml. in accord, less profound enhancement in cytotoxicity was observed. cytotoxicity of zymoxins is elevated in a hepatoma-derived cell line stably expressing NS3 protease or infected with HCV. cells were transfected with a new set of cleavage substrates encoding vectors. these vectors encode for the previously described NS3 cleavable substrate. junction was replaced by longer cleavage sequences of 18 amino acids (P10-P8\u2032) and 20 amino-acids (P10-P10\u2032) from 1b or 2a genotype NS5A/B junction sites, respectively. western blot analysis of lysate samples indicates the cleavage of the substrate incorporating the 2a NS5A/B site in infected cells. w.t or EGFP-full NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells were seeded (1104 cells per well) in 96-well plates. after 24 hours, cells were incubated for 96 hours with serial dilutions of the cleavable toxins. the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. each point represents the mean SD of a set of data determined in triplicates. we first evaluated whether NS3 expression within Huh7.5 cells would render them sensitive to zymoxin intoxication. treatment of infected/uninfected Huh7.5 cells with both cleavable DTA and RTA based zymoxins resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity upon infected cells. no enhancement in cytotoxicity upon infected cells was observed following treatment with the uncleavable controls. uninfected cells were seeded (1104 cells per well) in 96-well plates. cells were incubated for 96 hours with serial dilutions of the cleavable toxins. each point represents the mean SD of a set of data determined in triplicates. EGFP-scNS3 is predicted to be a predominantly cytoplasmic or nucleocytoplasmic protein with relatively low affinity to membranes. the NS3-NS4A complex directs the NS3-NS4A complex to the ER membrane or an ER-like modified compartment. expression of EGFP-scNS3 or EGFP-full NS3-4A is induced by addition of tetracycline (Tet) to the growth 10 amino acid minimal NS3 cleavage sequence (P6-P4\u2032) from HCV NS5A/B site derived from HCV genotype 1b/1a. addition of Tet to selected stable clones results in EGFP-scNS3 and EGFP- full NS3-4A expression. a strong colocalization, however, was observed between EGFP-full NS3-4A and a chimeric fluorescent protein which was fused to 105 cells inducibly expressing EGFP-scNS3 or EGFP-full NS3-4A were seeded on cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. after 12 hours, the cells were treated with 1g/ml of tetracycline. after 24 hours, cells were treated with 1g/ml of tetracycline or left untreated. mouse-serum anti-MBP followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL development (E) similar results were obtained also in cells inducibly expressing EGFP-full NS3-A4. a fusion of a bulky polypeptide moiety to the C terminus of DTA may hinder the interaction. d in its N terminus to the binding and translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) were substituted by the HNP1 polypeptide. a 6xHis tag followed by a KDEL ER retrieval signal were placed at the most C terminal portion of the construct. a chimeric toxin was constructed, in which the NS3 cleavage site was mutated by substituting P1 cysteine to 600ng of each toxin were incubated with or without 500ng of recombinant MBP-scNS3 fusion. 50ng of each toxin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 30ng of each toxin (cleaved and uncleaved) were mixed with wheat germ extract and [14C]-NAD and incubated for 40 min at RT. BP-scNS3 fusion produced in E. coli followed by aDP-ribosylation activity assay. incubation of the toxin \u201cPE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin\u201d with the protease resulted in a complete cleavage of the chimeric toxin that appeared as a lower weight product in immunoblot assay using anti-PE antibodies. tetracycline induction for expression of scNS3 and full NS3-4A has led to considerable activation of the cleavable toxin. the uncleavable toxin basal activity was more potent than the basal activity of the non-cleaved cleavable toxin (uninduced cells treated with \"PE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin\". the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. each point represents the mean SD of a set of data determined in triplicates. another uncleavable toxin, \u201cPE-DTA-no cleavage site-defensin\u201d in which the whole NS3 cleavage site was deleted, is also indifferent to the presence of the protease. we have cloned the coding sequence of the catalytic A chain of ricin (RTA) into a bacterial expression plasmid. we have constructed a chimeric toxin in which two repeats of the acidic 16 residue peptide corresponding to the conserved C terminus of the ribosomal stalk proteins were fused to the C terminus of RTA. enzymatic activity of zymoxin is elevated following NS3 protease cleavage. in-vitro cleavage reaction was carried out following ribosome depurination assay. phosphodiester bond at the 3\u2032 site of the depurinated adenine is cleaved under acidic conditions. a serial dilution of each toxin (treated or untreated with NS3) was incubated with 10l of rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C. total RNA from each mixture was extracted. half of the RNA was treated with acidic aniline (1M aniline in 2.8 M acetic acid) for 10 minutes at 40\u00b0C. xin without incubation with NS3) or with the uncleavable toxin could be detected after treatment with both the cleaved and the uncleavable toxins. this may result from the fact that the zymoxin is partially and not totally inhibited by the C-terminal extension. cytotoxicity of RTA-based zymoxin is elevated in NS3 expressing cells. after 9 hours, cells were treated with 1g/ml of tetracycline (+TET) or left untreated (NO TET) two hours later, cells were incubated for 72 hours with serial dilutions of the toxins. the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. T-Rex cells inducibly expressing full NS3-4A were seeded (2104 cells per well) in 96-well plates. after 24 hours, cells were supplemented with 1g/ml of tetracycline, 0.01g/ml of tetracycline or left untreated. eight hours later, cells were incubated for 72 hours with serial dilution of the toxins. the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. each point represents the mean SD of a set of data determined in triplicates. cytotoxicity of zymoxins is elevated in a hepatoma-derived cell line stably expressing NS3 protease or infected with HCV. 1b/1a genotype derived NS5A/B minimal cleavage site (P6-P4\u2032) was replaced by the longer 2a genotype (strain JFH1) NS5A/B junction sequence (P10-P10\u2032) in both DTA and RTA based cleavable zymoxins. w.t or EGFP-full NS3-4A expressing EGFP-full NS3-4A were seeded (3105 cells per well) after 24 hours, cells were lysed and samples of 15 g protein from total cell extracts were analyzed. hepatoma-derived cell line expressing the described EGFP-full NS3-4A was established. these cells were then verified for in-vivo NS3 proteolytic activity toward the cleavage substrate encoded by the vector \"pCMV/MBP-EGFP-full 2a JFH1 NS5AB-CBD\" at the Next step, wild-type and EGFP-full NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells were treated with treatment with the uncleavable controls resulted in a much less profound effect. treatment of infected cells with toxins incorporating NS5A/B cleavage site derived from the 1b genotype yielded much reduced enhancement in cytotoxicity, if any. the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. each point represents the mean SD of a set of data determined in triplicates. active vaccination is generally taken as a prevention act and usually when the patient is still uninfected. the proposed antiviral agents were artificially composed of an intracellular signaling moiety that inactivates a toxin, e.g. a degradation signal, which can be cleaved off by a viral protease. a slightly different strategy for construction of viral-protease activated agents was also applied. s in yeast, they identified a Vip2 proenzyme with significantly reduced enzymatic activity. the engineered zymogen was still powerful enough to cause the mortality of western corn rootworm larvae. law et al have demonstrated the conversion of a natural zymogen into an HIV protease-activated toxin. we have tried to convert the maize RIP into an HCV protease-activated toxin. but in our hands, insertion or replacement of sequences surrounding the internal inhibitory peptide did not generate a toxin that exhibits significant enhancement in cytotoxicity against NS3 expressing cells. the NS3 protease has been chosen to serve as a model for a virally encoded protease. a model HEK293 cell line inducibly expressing the HCV NS3-protease was established. it was previously reported that sitoxins that are pre-activated in-vitro have increased ability to inhibit cellular protein synthesis. this failure was due to the fact that the HIV virus-encoded protease is located at the plasma membrane and not available to activate the sitoxins. NS3 expression sensitizes Huh7.5 liver cells to zymoxin intoxication. treatment with both cleavable DTA and RTA based zymoxins resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity toward HCV infected Huh7.5 cells. however, when the cells were treated with uncleavable control toxins, no therapeutic window was observed. a viral protease provides a proof of concept for the feasibility of \u201czymogenization\u201d of natural toxins by rational design relaying on previous knowledge on the toxin's structure, interaction with substrate and existence of peptidic inhibitors. eradication of virally infected cells by using zymogenized toxins may represent another strategy in fighting viral diseases.
