{"summary": "genus Euphorbia is the largest among the plant family Euphorbiaceae. about 70 species have been reported in Iran that 17 of them are endemic (1). some species of this genus are used in folk medicines to cure skin diseases, gonorrhea, migraines, intestinal parasites, and warts (1). Isolated triterpenes from E. erythradenia. 13-acetyl-3-butanoyl-5-angeloyl-20-nicotinyl-1,2,6,7-tetrahydroingenol. m silica (YMC Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was equipped with 515 Waters pump and UV-Vis detector. all solvents used were of HPLC grade (Caledon Laboratory Chemicals Ltd., Georgetown, Ont. Canada) xane/chloroform (30100) was chromatographed on silica gel C.C. (hexane/ethyl acetate, 060) to afford five subfractions; TF2a-TF2e. subfractions were injected into preparative HPLC using hexane/ethyl acetate gradient system at detection wavelength of 270 nm. 227 (4.2), 269 (3.1), 297 (3.5), 302 (8.6), 315 (2.9), 325 (1.1), 355 (2.2), 381 (3.7), 409 (6.2), 424 (4.6), 442 (2.0); 1H-NMR data (400 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) data of E. erythradenia triterpenoids Pos 1a 1b 2 3 4 3 3.28 dd (4.4, 10.8) 3.28 m 3. 13C-NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, C in ppm) data of E. erythradenia triterpenoids Pos 1a 1b 2 3 4 1 31.9 31.9 32.0 32.0 38.4 2 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 27.2 3 78.8 78.8 78.8 78.8 78.8 78.8 79.0 40.5 40.5 40.5 38.8 5 47.1 47.1 47.1 new tab (24S)-Cycloart-25-ene-3,24-diol(1b): White, amorphous powder; 15 mg (1a & 1b); C30H50O2; MW (g/mol): 442; yield: 0.00064%; EI-MS m/z (rel. int.): 52 (47.7), 69 (42.6), 80 (100), 98 (46.2), 107 (27.4) 363 (4.4), 381 (12.7), 392 (12.3), 407 (4.6), 410 (32.7), 425 (22.4), 442 (6.2); 1H-NMR data (400 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) see Table 1; 13C-NMR data (100 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) see Table 1; 13C-NMR data (100 MHz, CDCl3) see Table 2. pseudotyped single cycle replicable HIV-1 virions produced by deleting a 2-kb fragment within the Pol region of the HIV-1 genome from the pNL4-3 strain. psPAX2 plasmid encodes the HIV-1 full-length RNA, with packaging ability containing the deletion in the Pol region. pMD2G plasmid encodes the vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein (VSVG cells were seeded at a density of 6 104 cells per well in 96-well plates. each well was infected with 600 ng of p24 single cycle replicable virions. cells were then incubated for 48 hours in a total volume of 200 L per well of fresh medium containing various concentrations of compounds 1-8. the cytotoxic concentration that resulted in a reduction of the number of viable cells by 50% (CC50) was calculated from dose response curves. a docking grid box was built with 28, 28 and 28 points in 12.79, 23.30 and 5.85 directions. 13C-NMR spectral data of cycloartane structures and Compound 1a & 1b 13C-NMR was decoupled. remaining carbons included three methyl groups (C 18.3, 17.2 and 17.6), four methylene groups that two of them are involved in olefinic bonds (C 31.5, 31.6 &110.9, 111.4), three methane groups which two of them are oxygenated (C 35.9, 76.3 and 76.7), and methylene group has appeared as a doublet in the downfield region. a triplet peak at H 4.02 (J = 6.4 Hz) showed neighboring oxygenated methine to an aliphatic CH2 in one side and quaternary carbon in another side. a singlet at H 1.72 cleared that one of methyl groups is connected to quaternary carbon while another methyl linked to a methine because of its doublet multiplicity. compound 2 was determined as cycloart-23-ene-3,25-diol. based on BB decoupled 13C-NMR spectrum and DEPT, side chain contained three methyl groups, two methylene groups, one oxygenated methine group and an oxygenated quaternary carbon. the presence of a carboxylic group and a double bond, taking together with seven degrees of unsaturation, supported pentacyclic structure of compound 4. two signals at H 3.22 (1H, dd, J = 11.0, 4.6 Hz) and 2.82 (1H, dd, J = 13.8, 4.2 Hz) represented an oxygenated and allylic protons, respectively. compound 7 showed significant anti HIV activity (IC50 = 0.008 M, CC50 = 3.264 M, TI = 380.64) and higher therapeutic index than nevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used to treat HIV-1 infection and AIDS."}
