{"summary": "lack of this regulatory pathway in Cd200\u2013/\u2013mice leads to exacerbation of autoimmune diseases e.g. autoimmune diseases e.g. autoimmune encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis in mice [2] lack of this regulatory pathway in Cd200\u2013/\u2013mice leads to exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. the use of CD200R agonists exert a potent inhibitory effect on inflammation-driven carcinogenesis and metastasis [18]. in the animal model, CD200 overexpression results in increased lymph node metastasis [20]. most common laboratory mouse strains have only one inhibitory CD200R (CD200R1), whereas CD200R2 is expressed in AKR, CD1 and NOD strains. 3H/Hej mouse strains, OX131, can be used as inhibitory CD200R1-specific in these strains. Traditionally macrophages are divided into two opposite phenotypes. classically and alternatively activated cells, M1, and M2 respectively. mice with tumors that did not have typical shape or the size were excluded from the experiment. all in vivo experiments and specific procedures and protocols used for this study were performed in accordance with the guidelines and approved by the First Local Ethics Committee. tumor growth was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. to quantify the bioluminescence signal of mice, the regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the tumor region and results were used to generate growth curves. erythrocytes were lysed using a buffer containing 155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaH2CO3, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3. cells were blocked in 5% normal rat serum and stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies. mice were reared in the animal house of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology (Warsaw, Poland) at the end of all experiments, mice were sacrificed by anesthesia overdose. ficial tumors models were induced in Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into the right thigh on day 0. Mice were injected into a tail vein once every 3 days, starting from day 6\u20137, with anti-CD200R (clone OX110 or OX131) mice were cut into small pieces, digested for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. tissue fragments were dissociated using a gentleMACS Dissociator. cells were centrifuged and stained using a buffer containing 155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaH2CO3, and 0.1 mM EDTA. mice subcutaneously inoculated with mammary gland cancer cells (EMT6) treated with agonistic anti-CD200R (clone OX110) or isotype control. anti-CD200R treatment decreased fluorescence of CD200R by flow cytometry using the same antibody clone. all analyzed intratumoral immune cell populations showed tumor penetration by intravenously administered anti-CD200R. however, relative differences observed in splenocytes were smaller than in the tumor subpopulations. X131 showed no effect of the clone on the growth of EMT6 tumors. cytometric analysis of intratumoral immune cells showed no effect of the clone on the growth of tumors. we found decreased IFN- (Fig 2E) and TNF- (Fig 2F) in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. but these differences were not statistically significant. we analyzed the effect of anti-CD200R (OX110) treatment in two distinct tumor models. tumor growth depicted as tumor surface of LLC, N = 5 / group. tumor burden quantified as luminescence of the luciferase expressed by tumor cells in lungs (B16F10), N = 10 / group. expression of CD200R in intratumoral immune cells of LLC tumors. control mice had higher tumor burden as compared to Cd200-/- mice. CD200 negative tumors grew significantly slower in the lungs of Cd200-/- mice. lack of CD200 expression inhibits endogenous skin tumors development. agonistic anti-CD200R antibodies did not affect the growth of CD200-negative subcutaneous tumors: melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma in syngeneic tumor models. lack of agonistic anti-CD200R interaction in a Cd200-/- host does inhibit tumor growth of CD200-negative cells. expression of CD200 on host or melanoma cells promotes tumor growth. treatment with agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor development without additional immune/inflammatory stimulation. blockade of CD200-CD200R interaction could inhibit tumor growth, supporting antagonistic CD200 or CD200R antibodies as a treatment option in cancer."}
