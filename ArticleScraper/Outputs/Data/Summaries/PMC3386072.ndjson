{"summary": "the nsp10 and nsp14 proteins were previously shown to interact using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems (15, 16) for this purpose, SARS-CoV Strep-nsp10 and nsp14HN proteins were coexpressed in Escherichia coli. the bacterial cell lysate was incubated with Strep-Tactin beads to bind the nsp10 protein. *p-H4 RNA was incubated at 37 \u00b0C in TrisHCl buffer 40 mM (pH 8), DTT 5 mM with no protein (lane 1), 0.7 M of nsp14 (lane 2), nsp10 (lane 3) or both proteins (lane 4) during a 90-min period. reaction products were separated by denaturing Urea-PAGE and revealed using photostimulated plates and a FujiImager (Fuj the nsp10 protein does not carry any nuclease activity under these conditions. incubation of both proteins results in a strong nuclease activity. we determined optimal reaction conditions as well as metallic ion requirements of the nsp10/nsp14 ExoN activity. nsp14 mutants migrate at their expected molecular weight after purification. mutations of residues belonging to motif Exo I, II, or III completely abrogate ExoN activity. nsp10/nsp14 ExoN activity involves the nsp14 DEDDh catalytic residues. nsp14 mutants were incubated with nsp10 and *p-H4 RNA for 0, 2, and 30 min. in lane 5XD331A, the concentration of the mutant was fivefold higher. RNA hydrolysis was quantified upon denaturing Urea-PAGE. the results show that interaction of nsp10 and nsp14 is required for the stimulation of ExoN activity. residues annihilating both nsp10/nsp14 interaction and ExoN activity are localized within a surface area involved in the nsp10/nsp16 interaction. the nsp10/nsp16 complex image (Upper) was represented using PyMOL. nsp16 is represented in green, nsp10 in gold, and nsp10 zinc structural ions as gray spheres. nsp10/nsp14 ExoN activity requires an RNA 3\u2032-end engaged in a duplex structure. the resulting dsRNA heteroduplex is rapidly hydrolyzed by nsp10/nsp14 into shorter products of 3\u20134 nt. the resulting dsRNA heteroduplex is rapidly hydrolyzed by nsp10/nsp14. dsRNA oligonucleotides carrying either a 3\u2032-terminal puromycin (*p-H4-puro) or phosphate (H4-*pCOH) resist nsp10/nsp14-mediated hydrolysis. dsRNA oligonucleotides carrying either a 3\u2032-terminal puromycin (*p-H4-puro) or phosphate (H4-*pCOH) resist s H2-CUU(N)10 and H5-GUU(N)10 were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and then dephosphorylated and radiolabeled. these RNAs were then incubated with nsp15 to generate a terminal 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate RNAs [H2-CU(U)>P and H5-GU(U)>P] (22, 23) nsp15-mediated hydrolysis is unlikely to serve as an entry point for nsp14 ExoN. we assayed the ability of nsp14 to excise 3\u2032-end mismatched nucleotides. a 40-mer RNA carrying a 3\u2032-biotin group was annealed to a radiolabeled reverse-complement RNA carrying no mismatch (LS2). a substrate carrying a 3\u2032-end mismatch competes out more efficiently the perfectly matched 3\u2032-end substrate than the other way around. a mismatched 3\u2032-end base pair might actually be the preferred substrate for nsp10/nsp14 activity. the assay was performed using 100 nM of nsp14 and 400 nM of nsp10. nsp10/nsp14 is able to efficiently remove a 3\u2032-terminal mismatch present on an RNA supposedly being synthesized by nsp12. expression and purification of nsp10 and nsp14 from pDest14/(His)6-nsp10, pDest14/(His)6-nsp14, and pTXB1-nsp14 vectors were performed as described previously (9). RNA Synthesis and Purification were performed as described previously (22). reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (formamide containing 10 mM EDTA) the digestion products were then analyzed in 7 M urea containing 20% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels."}
