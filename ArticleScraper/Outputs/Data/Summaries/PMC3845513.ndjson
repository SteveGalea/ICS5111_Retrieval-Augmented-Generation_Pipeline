{"summary": "corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a serious complication of systemic corticosteroid administration for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), nephrotic syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. most patients require surgical treatment for pain relief and improvement of hip joint function. methylprednisolone enhances contraction of the femoral head's lateral epiphyseal arteries and reduces femoral head blood flow. there are no reports on whether maintenance doses of corticosteroids affect operation outcomes in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. the PCA group was matched to a group of patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH who had not received corticosteroids treatment after the FVFG. matching was based on gender, average age, preoperative corticosteroid dose, preoperative Steinberg stage, and preoperative Harris hip score. clinical and radiographic results were evaluated using HHS. they were considered excellent for HHS 90 points, good for HHS 80\u201389 points, fair for HHS 70\u201379 points, and poor for HHS 70 points. radiographic evaluations were independently performed by two radiologists. patients with stages II, III, and IV of ONFH were performed with FVFG. postoperative corticosteroid administration group was ongoing maintenance corticosteroid therapy for the primary disease for at least 6 months after the FVFG. matching was based on gender, average age, preoperative corticosteroid dose, preoperative Steinberg stage, and preoperative Harris hip score. postoperative pain was managed by administering NSAIDs. patients were instructed to avoid bearing weight on the leg that received the FVFG for three months. follow-up Follow-up examinations were performed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years. end point was conversion to a total hip replacement. the study was approved by the regional ethics committee. all patients were ethnic Chinese. primary diseases requiring corticosteroid treatment included SLE. 5.6 (2.5\u201310) 0 Duration of corticosteroid treatment after surgery (mo) 28.6 (9\u201366) 0 Mean follow-up (y) 5.4 (2\u201310) 5.0 (2\u201310) 3.2. in the control group, the mean preoperative HHS was 72.0 9.1 points for all hips and the mean postoperative HHS was 83.2 10.9 points. 1.4 5.7 93.1 6.8 72.3 4.5 86.6 7.1 65.2 6.8 76.6 9.3 3.3. radiographic results In the PCA group, 49 hips were improved in the last radiographs. in the control group, 47 hips were improved, 13 hips appeared unchanged, and 7 hips appeared worse. no patients in the two groups had serious acute complications. one patient had deep vein thrombosis and was successfully treated with oral medication. two hips in the group and three hips in the control group had wound hematomas. in the control group, the mean preoperative HHS was 72.3 8.5 points and the mean postoperative HHS was 84.9 10.2 points. the average increase in scores was 11.1 8.7 points for all hips in the PCA group and 12.6 7.4 points for all hips in the control group. in the control group, 47 hips were improved, 13 hips appeared unchanged, and 7 hips appeared worse. the postoperative Harris hip scores at the latest follow-up were 74 and 85. the patient received corticosteroid treatment at maintenance doses until the latest follow-up. osteotomy was reported to have favourable results in treating ONFH. but the success of the osteotomy is related to the extent and location of the necrotic lesions. free vascularised fibular grafting is an appealing alternative to core decompression for treatment of ONFH. postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids did not have an adverse effect on the outcomes of FVFG for treatment of corticosteroid-induced ONFH. studies found corticosteroids adversely impact the femoral head in a dose-dependent manner [20\u201322]"}
