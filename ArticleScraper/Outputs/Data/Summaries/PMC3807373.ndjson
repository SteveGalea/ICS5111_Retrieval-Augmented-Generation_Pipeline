{"summary": "novel coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 in patients suffering from severe respiratory infection that led to pneumonia and 50% mortality (1\u20135) the viral RNA can be detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using pan-coronavirus primers that recognize conserved CoV sequences or primers that distinguish MERS-CoV from other CoVs. analysis of viral load in the respiratory tracts of SARS patients revealed peak viral load occurred at 10 days after onset of fever (14). this suggests there may be a window of opportunity for administration of antiviral therapy within the first 10 days of illness, potentially reducing viral load and mortality. over the last 10 years, there has been considerable effort aimed at generating effective antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV. coexpression of a protease domain with a cleavage-activated luciferase substrate allowed for both endpoint evaluation and live-cell imaging profiles of protease activity. a previously identified 3CLpro inhibitor of SARS-CoV and murine coronavirus replication effectively blocks the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. the pGlo-30F vector backbone (Promega) is a circularly permuted Photuris pennsylvanica luciferase optimized for expression in cell culture (25) the resulting plasmids were designated pGlo-30F-RLKGG and pGlo-30F-VRLQS. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with 300 l of lysis buffer A. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST buffer. transfections equalized to 500 ng per well with an empty pcDNA3.1-V5/His-B vector. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with 1 passive lysis buffer. 25 l of lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using 96-well white-bottom assay plates. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or catalytic-mutant (CA) pMERS-pp3CLpro and pGlo-VRLQS DNA, incubated for 14 h, and then treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 M CE-5 or DMSO for 6 h. the experiment was performed in triplicate, with error bars representing the standard deviations of the means. pMERS-CoV PLpro was codon optimized, synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5/His-B (Invitrogen) the membrane was treated with stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM 2-beta-mercaptoethanol) specific mutations in catalytic residues (C3395 in nsp5) and putative cleavage site of nsp5/6 (Q3553/S3554) were generated by using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) the pGlo-30F vector backbone (Promega) is a circularly permuted Photuris pennsylvanica luciferase optimized for proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h at 65 V at 4\u00b0C. membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST buffer. the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (anti-GFP) antibody (Life Technologies), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit HEK293T cells were transfected with 37.5 ng pGlo-30F, pGlo-30F-RLKGG, or pRL-TK. transfections equalized to 125 ng with empty vector pcDNA3.1-V5/His-B. cells were then treated with concentrations of drug indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. the experiment was performed in triplicate, with error bars representing the standard deviations of the means. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or catalytic-mutant (CA) pMERS-pp3CLpro and pGlo-VRLQS for 13 h. reblotted using mouse monoclonal antibody to beta-actin (Ambion) plasmid DNA expressing wild-type or catalytic-mutant form of MERS-CoV PLpro was transfected into HEK293T cells along with a plasmid DNA expressing the nsp2/3-GFP substrate. sp2/3-GFP substrate in the presence of the catalytically active form of MERS-CoV PLpro but not in the presence of the catalytic-mutant MERS-CoV PLpro. these data confirm that the putative papain-like protease domain indeed functions as a papain-like protease capable of cleaving LXGG-containing polyprotein substrates. predicted PLpro cleavage sites indicated; pMERS-PLpro corresponds to amino acid residues (aa) 1485 to 1802. ADRP, ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-monophosphatase; PLpro, papain-like protease; 3CL, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease; Prm, primase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ZBD, zinc-binding coV amino acids 1541 to 1855, AY278741; and MHV amino acids 1609 to 1911, NC_001846. luciferase-based biosensor assay takes advantage of an inverted, circularly permuted luciferase construct. protease recognition site is limited in size, and only 5 amino acids were engineered into the construct. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pGlo-30F-RLKGG and either pMERS-PLpro or pMERS-PLpro-CA. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and assayed using the dual-luciferase assay. experiment was performed in triplicate, with error bars representing the standard deviations of the averages. a dual-luciferase assay was performed on the lysates. luciferase activity can be detected in live cells by using a live-cell readout. HEK293T cells in a 96-well format were transfected with MERS-CoV PLpro and the pGlo-RLKGG-expressing substrate. at 15 h posttransfection, the cells were incubated in GloSensor reagent and monitored for luciferase activity. the catalytic-mutant MERS-CoV PLpro-expressing cells showed a 10-fold increase over levels in the mock transfection cell background BD-15g cannot bind the loop of MERS-CoV PLpro, leaving the active site accessible to the substrate. further work is needed to identify inhibitors that block MERS-CoV PLpro or are broadly inhibitory to CoV PLpros. wild-type pp3CLpro protease cleaved the polyprotein, generating an nsp5/6N-V5 product that can be detected by Western blotting. the nsp6-V5 product is predicted to be only 5.6 kDa and was undetectable by Western blotting in the wild-type sample. anti-V5 detects polyprotein and processed products. anti-beta-actin was used to monitor protein loading. alignments performed using ViPR software MUSCLE alignment algorithms. the wild-type 3CLpro construct led to a rapid activation of luciferase. this activation increased to >300-fold above levels in the live-cell assay. the catalytic-mutant 3CLpro was not capable of cleaving the luciferase biosensor. the structure for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with a peptidomimetic inhibitor termed N3 was recently solved. significant structural similarities between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CLpros were noted (34). this results suggest that broadly reactive 3CLpro inhibitors may block MERS 3CLpro activity. luciferase levels measured for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro wild type were set to 100%. the drug treatment inhibited the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to 30% of that of DMSO-treated cells at a maximum dose of 50 M. luciferase-based biosensor for protease activity will facilitate screening and identification of effective small-molecule inhibitors for MERS-CoV and future emerging coronaviruses. a catalytic-mutant MERS-CoV PLpro was generated by mutating the catalytic cysteine residue (amino acid 1594) to an alanine. we detected evidence of processing of the nsp2/3-GFP substrate in the presence of the catalytically active form of MERS-CoV PLpro. this data confirm that the putative papain-like protease domain located within nsp3 of the MERS-CoV genome indeed functions as a papain-like protease capable of cleaving LXGG-containing polyprotein substrates. pMERS-PLpro corresponds to amino acid residues (aa) 1485 to 1802.
