{"summary": "wild birds are the natural reservoirs and historic source of all influenza A viruses (IAVs) 1, 2 They harbor all known hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. 3, 4 These viruses are generally nonpathogenic to wild birds. despite the importance of gene pool of AIVs in wild birds, knowledge about this gene pool is limited. two classes of antiviral drugs, the M2 channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and zanamivir and oseltamivir, are available for treatment of human influenza. migratory birds may play an important role in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. 1, 28 this necessitates continuing surveillance of AIV evolution in its natural host so that information on emerging HPAI and potential human pandemic strains can be obtained. RTPCR was performed to amplify the entire open reading frame of Mgene. initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes followed by initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 43\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. s were isolated from cloacal swabs of wild birds collected during 2007\u20132008. realtime RTPCR 29 was used to confirm the presence of AIVs in harvested allantoic fluids. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by aligning nucleotide sequences of all isolates with reference sequences obtained from GenBank. antiviral resistance Sequences were analyzed using annotation tools available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to identify any antiviral drug resistance\u2013associated mutations in the Mgene. Phylogenetic analysis of Mgene showed that Mgene from all isolates in this study belonged to North American avian lineage (Figure 1). phylogenetic analysis of matrix gene of avian influenza isolates inferred using the neighborjoining method and 500 bootstrap replicates. the evolutionary distances were computed using the number of differences method, and evolutionary analyses were performed in mega ver 5.0. phylogenetic analysis of M2 gene of avian influenza isolates inferred using the neighborjoining method and 100 bootstrap replicates. evolutionary distances were computed using the pdistance method. 17 of the 128 isolates from LBMs (133%) were found to have mutations that are known to confer adamantine resistance. 16 of these 17 isolates had S31N change and one isolate had V27A mutation. a sequence of approximately 900 nucleotides (nt) in length, encoding for two proteins, was obtained. no insertions or deletions were observed in any of the sequences. phylogenetic analysis of Mgene showed that Mgene from all isolates in this study belonged to North American avian lineage. there was no distribution of isolates in the phylogenetic tree on the basis of host, year of isolation, or subtype. all isolates in this study were divided into two major groups, I and II. Phylogenetic analysis of Mgene on the basis of amino acid sequences showed considerable difference from that done on the basis of nucleotide sequences. the evolutionary distances were computed using the pdistance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. evolutionary analyses were performed in mega ver 5.0. most of the amino acid changes were observed in LBM isolates as compared to WB isolates as compared to WB isolates. ND, not detected. 17 of the 128 isolates from LBMs (133%) were found to have mutations that are known to confer adamantine resistance. 17 of the 128 isolates from LBMs (133%) were found to have mutations that are known to confer adamantine resistance. e from all AIV isolates used in this study with isolates from other locations showed clear segregation of AIVs in clusters with respect to geographic location. these results are similar to those of manzoor et al. 37 who observed that 65 of 67 isolates from freeflying birds belonged to Eurasian nongull lineage, one to Eurasian gulllike, and one to the North American nongullavian lineage. M1 protein is integral membrane protein forming pHgated channels in the viral lipid membrane. more sites in the M2 protein under positive selection are located in the extracellular domain, which is recognized by the host immune response system. avian niche do not experience a selective pressure because of drug use. detection of resistant isolates from LBMs shows possibility of de novo substitution leading to the emergence of resistant AIV strains. adamantine resistance arises as independent point mutations rather than reassortment or covariation.
