{"summary": "endosulfan is one of the most toxic pesticides commonly used in agriculture. it was classified as a POP by the Stockholm Convention in 2011. average endosulfan levels in the soils were found to be much higher in india than other Asian countries like china. endosulfan is readily absorbed by humans via the skin, the lungs, the stomach and the placenta. it is reported that the milk concentration of endosulfan was 0.4\u201356.2 g ml\u20131 and human blood concentration of endosulfan was 0.69\u2013176.2 g ml\u20131 in Kasargod district of Kerala in India. a transition from activation of the DNA damage response p53 pathway at low doses to induction of genes involved in angiogenesis, evasion of apoptosis and growth signals at high doses was evident only in the lungs of mice. the utility of gene expression profiling in distinguishing adaptive response or adverse effects for new POPs such as endosulfan has not yet been well understood. endosulfan (Anbang, Jiangsu) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) to prepare a 0.5 M stock solution. endosulfan markedly inhibited cell viability, so the concentration of 20 M can be considered as a start concentration of endosulfan cytotoxicity in human endothelial cells. the labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (4 44 K, Agilent Technologies) the arrays were scanned by using the Agilent Scanner G2505C. genes for which at least 3 out of 4 samples have flags detected were chosen for further data analysis. endothelial phenotype exposed to endosulfan. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with 3% BSA (Roche). cell-cycle distributions and apoptosis were measured as described previously. data were evaluated by Student's two-tail t-tests conducted using Microsoft Excel. endosulfan (Anbang, Jiangsu) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) to prepare a 0.5 M stock solution. endosulfan at 20 M markedly inhibited cell viability. the labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (4 44 K, Agilent Technologies) the arrays were scanned by using the Agilent Scanner G2505C. genes for which at least 3 out of 4 samples have flags detected were chosen for further data analysis. endothelial phenotype exposed to endosulfan. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with 3% BSA (Roche). cell-cycle distributions and apoptosis measured as described previously. differentially expressed genes among 26 728 detected genes were observed in HUVEC-C cells following exposure to different doses of endosulfan. the percentage of altered genes in all detected genes was 2.9%, 4.0% and 12.3% in the 20, 40 and 60 M dose groups of endosulfan. the most down-regulated genes included N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (Npl), vacuolar protein sorting 25 homolog (S. cerevisiae) (Vps25), caspase recruitment domain family, member 14 (Card14) and potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily M, alpha member 1 (Kcnma1) in all the dose groups. functional analysis was employed to assign biological processes and functional categories to significant genes in DAVID. we listed the top five significantly enriched biological processes for overlapping up-regulated genes in all the dose groups. neurological system process (GO:0044093), signal transduction (GO: 0007165), ion transport (GO:0006811), cellular chemical homeostasis (GO:0055082) and homeostasis process (GO: 0042592) were the top five significantly enriched biological processes for overlapping genes across the ES groups. the difference of significantly enriched biological processes (P 0.05, FDR 0.05) included cellular response to stress, response to DNA damage stimulus, and GO ID Term Gene counts P value 20 M ES GO:0033554 Cellular response to stress 21 4.7 10\u20133 GO:0006974 Response to DNA damage stimulus 15 1.0 10\u20132 GO:0007165 Signal transduction 42 1.2 10\u20132 GO:0042127 Regulation of cell proliferation 15 3.3 10\u20132 GO:0008104 Protein localization 25 4.0 10\u20132 40 M ES GO:0050877 Neurological system process 36 3.0 10\u2013 transcriptional misregulation in cancer was the common pathway between ES 40 and 60 M dose groups. the number of genes perturbed and the magnitude of expression changes in the transcriptional misregulation pathway in cancer correlate with the dose of endosulfan. p53 signaling pathway was one of the most affected pathways, regulating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, DNA damage and repair.
