{"summary": "a virus particle, or virion, essentially consists of genomic information enclosed in a protective protein shell (capsid) in some cases, the capsid is further surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell. however, viruses lack the autonomous machineries required for protein synthesis and metabolism. replication cycle of eukaryotic viruses varies greatly between different virus families. cytosolic entry (ii) releases the viral genome, which is replicated (iv) either in the cytosol or in the nucleus of the host cell. a substantial part of the viral life cycle escapes this type of observation. correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approaches aim at resolving structures of intracellular subviral complexes by electron tomography or focused ion beam milling\u2013scanning EM. however, CLEM yields snapshots rather than capturing dynamic information essential for a full understanding of the infection process. a key technology for the observation of dynamic processes within living cells is fluorescence microscopy. advanced imaging data acquisition requires sophisticated analysis pipelines for objective and quantitative analyses of imaging data. the genetically encoded marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the constantly expanding panel of engineered fluorescent proteins (FPs) [7] have been, and still are, invaluable tools for the investigation of dynamic events in cell biology. stainable genetically encoded tags allow the attachment of synthetic fluorophores to a protein of interest (POI) but the molecular dimensions of these tags are not negligible compared to the size of the POI. viral proteins are particularly challenging targets for genetic modification. click chemistry has also provided virologists with tools for labeling viruses. the biology of viruses can be exploited to render nucleic acid labeling virus specific. clickable nucleotide analogs could also be designed as substrates preferentially used by a virus encoded DNA or RNA polymerase. click chemistry is a simple approach for introducing bioorthogonal functional groups into viruses. it involves the metabolic incorporation of functionalized building blocks for proteins, glycans or lipids that are components of the viral particle. this incorporation will also affect components of the viral particle. peptides demonstrated that AdV particles can be decorated with different functional groups through this sugar moiety without affecting virus production or infectivity. the resulting engineered virions were not used for imaging studies, but were decorated with molecules that mediate retargeting of the virus to a desired host cell type. a bio-orthogonal amino acid carrying a chemically reactive group (Figure 3a) is incorporated at the position of interest by GCE. the second step comprises the click labeling reaction, which results in the covalent ligation of proteins with synthetic fluorophores or other molecules of choice. tRNAPyl/aaRSPyl pairs are adapted from the archaea methanosarcina mazei and methanosarcina barkeri. the most commonly used tRNAPyl/aaRSPyl pairs are adapted from the archaea methanosarcina mazei and methanosarcina barkeri [10,11,12] derivatives carrying the small linear alkyne group react efficiently with molecules functionalized with an azide group via CuAAC. this well established and efficient reaction has the disadvantage that the Cu(I) required for catalysis is highly toxic for bacterial and eukaryotic cells. non-enveloped viruses consist of a genome enclosed in a proteinaceous capsid built from multiple copies of one or more capsid proteins. these multiple requirements limit the possibilities for genetic modification of capsid proteins without interfering with virus particle formation or infectivity. non-enveloped viruses have been found to tolerate a limited degree of non-specific chemical modification of free amide- or sulfhydryl groups on the viral surface. a region present in all three capsid proteins (VP1-3) of AAV2 can be engineered to incorporate an azido-lysine residue without affecting virus infectivity. the resulting virus particles carried 60 reactive ncAA, which could be ligated via SPAAC to a strained alkyne-fluorophore conjugate. the virus was not used for imaging purposes in this study. phospholipid bilayer carries viral envelope glycoproteins required for virus attachment and entry. envelope proteins and lipids, as well as inner capsid proteins, are interesting targets for fluorescent labeling. studies published to date focus on envelope proteins which are (i) surface exposed, (ii) often not arranged in regular lattices and (iii) often highly glycosylated. double-labeled particles were prepared by combining mCherry as a viral content marker with click labeling of Ac4ManNAz incorporated into the Env glycoprotein. this approach made possible the visualization of cytosolic entry events by SVT based on the separation of the envelope signal from the viral content. modified protein in pre- and post-fusion conformation; bottom, smFRET traces favoring the pre- (pH 7) and post-fusion (pH 5.6) state. the site-specific introduction of ncAA into envelope proteins by GCE has gained increasing interest in recent years. the first proof of concept came for the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) viral fusion protein hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) required for virus release. ncAA residues were labeled with TCOK* and SCOK as ncAA. a recent study raised the application of click labeling in virology to the next level. the authors developed a single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-based approach to distinguish between the pre- and post-fusion conformation of the HA molecule. they simultaneously incorporated two TCOK* residues at strategic positions within the HA protein of IAV. they could show that the molecules are highly dynamic, reversibly interconverting between three distinct conformational states. mutational analysis revealed 70% of point mutations tested severely impaired or abolished viral infectivity. a large database derived from mutational analyses, as well as structural information, is available for many viruses to aid the selection of promising target sites. amber suppression may result in deficient particle formation by reducing the intracellular concentration of a structural protein below a critical value or by skewing the balance between different building blocks of the viral particle. the probability that a truncated version may interfere with the assembly, and thus be dominant negative, is high, and may need to be experimentally assessed. the application of this strategy boosted amber suppression efficiency fourfold in the case of the Env glycoprotein of HIV-1 [32]. optimized GCE procedures have been developed for standard cell lines that yield high transfection efficiencies and high expression levels of the amber suppression system and the POI (e.g., HEK293T) such cell lines are perfectly suited for the production of engineered virus particles for subsequent infection experiments. baculoviral vectors are a particularly attractive possibility for experiments in tissue culture with cell types which are difficult to manipulate. the strategy is surprisingly well tolerated by cells in principle, but bound to have pleiotropic and toxic effects. the use of purified engineered viruses for the infection of native target cells circumvents potential toxic effects of the GCE procedure on the host cell. this advantage does not apply to investigations of the late phase of viral replication cycles, where proteins need to be engineered, labeled and analyzed. the chemistry of the ncAA and clickable dye are also of relevance for measurements within virus-producing cells. low rate constants necessitate high dye concentrations to achieve reasonable labeling efficiencies. side reactions of ncAAs bound to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase may occur. viral strategies include rapid and efficient gene transcriptional shutoff. this could interfere with the required expression of components of the GCE system. it may also be necessary to establish a careful balance between the expression of GCE components and the virus. azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) mediated ligation to fluorophores or peptides demonstrated that AdV particles can be decorated with different functional groups through this sugar moiety without affecting virus production or infectivity. the resulting engineered virions were not used for imaging studies, but were decorated with molecules that mediate retargeting of the virus to a desired host cell type. this strategy has been explored for bacteriophages and has been used for the modification of AdV-derived gene therapy vectors without impairing vector production or infectivity. however, this method is neither protein- nor site-specific, defying the purpose of minimally invasive, virus specific labeling. lipids The lipid envelope encasing the capsid is a key feature of enveloped viruses. the envelope is derived from a host cell membrane; however, its lipid composition can differ from the parental membrane. membrane composition may also determine the fusion properties of the particle in the viral entry process. the site-specific engineering of proteins via click chemistry is a two-step process. a bio-orthogonal amino acid carrying a chemically reactive group is incorporated at the position of interest by GCE. the second step comprises the click labeling reaction, which results in the covalent ligation of proteins with synthetic fluorophores. tRNAs are recognized and decoded as the 22nd amino acid pyrrolysine (Pyl) [23] in certain methanogenic archaea. the most commonly used tRNAPyl/aaRSPyl pairs are adapted from the archaea methanosarcina mazei and methanosarcina barkeri [10,11,12] ncAAs carry strained alkynes or alkenes such as cyclooctyne or trans-cyclooctene. strained alkynes react only with tetrazines via a strain-promoted SPAAC reaction. non-enveloped viruses consist of a genome enclosed in a proteinaceous capsid built from multiple copies of one or more capsid proteins. these multiple requirements limit the possibilities for genetic modification of capsid proteins without interfering with virus particle formation or infectivity. non-enveloped viruses have been found to tolerate a limited degree of non-specific chemical modification of free amide- or sulfhydryl groups on the viral surface. the labeling of AAV for imaging analyses of viral entry has been approached by fusion of eGFP to VP2, one of the three capsid proteins of AAV [25] or by carbodiimide coupling of quantum dots to reactive cysteines and lysines on the viral surface. however, these strategies can affect virus infectivity, and the addition of quantum dots nearly doubles the hydrodynamic radius of the virion [26]. viruses are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, which carries viral envelope glycoproteins required for virus attachment and entry as well as cellular transmembrane proteins. studies focus on the envelope proteins which are (i) surface exposed, (ii) often not arranged in regular lattices and (iii) often highly glycosylated, opening the possibility for metabolic labeling. um et al. [30] adapted the strategy to the highly-glycosylated envelope (Env) protein of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). double-labeled particles were prepared by combining mCherry as a viral content marker with click labeling of Ac4ManNAz incorporated into the Env glycoprotein. this approach made possible the visualization of cytosolic entry events by SVT based on the separation of the ncAA is a small ( 35 nm) spherical enveloped virusoid. its circular ssRNA genome is the smallest mammalian virus genome (1.7 kb) Nikic et al. [31] engineered influenza HA protein and established a pulse-chase strategy based on introducing TCOK* and SCOK as ncAA, followed by orthogonal labeling of these residues with Me-Tet-Cy5 and H-Tet-Atto532, respectively. gp120 of HIV-1 accepts introduction of a ncAA residue at several positions within a variable surface loop of the protein the authors simultaneously incorporated two TCOK* residues at strategic positions within the HA protein of IAV. they could show that the molecules are highly dynamic, reversibly interconverting between three distinct conformational states. the authors could show that the molecules are highly dynamic, reversibly interconverting between three distinct conformational states. non-enveloped viruses have been found to tolerate a limited degree of non-specific chemical modification of free amide- or sulfhydryl groups on the viral surface. the most frequently targeted representatives of this group are Adeno-associated viruses (AAV), small ( 25 nm) icosahedral ssDNA viruses which infect humans and other primate species. the measles virus was not used for imaging purposes in this study. the virus was not used for imaging purposes in this study. the measles virus (MV) is a viral envelope glycoprotein. the surface of the virion is decorated with hemagglutinin (HA) and with the viral fusion protein FP. the labeled particles were not used to investigate the virus entry process. this study set the stage for the metabolic labeling of enveloped viruses. click labeled HIV-1 Env in virus expressing cells shows clusters of Env molecules recruited to viral assembly sites. smFRET traces recorded at pH conditions favoring the pre- and post-fusion (pH 5.6) state. the site-specific introduction of ncAA into envelope proteins by GCE has gained interest in recent years. fluorophores or biotin molecules were clicked to the surface of engineered HDV by CuAAC [34] but the particles were not used for further biological studies. the influenza A virus (IAV), another important human pathogen, is a segmented RNA virus of the genus Orthomyxovirus. the labeled protein was also shown to be suitable for STED nanoscopy. this allows the analysis of the nanoscale clustering of Env around viral assembly sites at the plasma membrane. a recent study raised the application of GCE/click labeling in virology to the next level. ing the envelope of virions uses the fact that clickable azido sugar derivatives can be used by cellular glycosylation machines instead of natural sugars without overt cytotoxic effects. the first example of envelope glycoprotein labeling via metabolic incorporation of clickable sugars was presented for the measles virus. virions were prepared and subjected to click labeling (green); propidium iodine staining (red) was performed to visualize all virions. the figure shows images of filamentous virus-like particles budding from the plasma membrane of a producer cell. labeling of viral proteins by Amber Suppression is straightforward, robust and relatively easy to perform. hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small ( 35 nm) spherical enveloped virusoid. its circular ssRNA genome is the smallest mammalian virus genome (1.7 kb) gp120 of HIV-1 accepts introduction of a ncAA residue at several positions within a variable surface loop of the protein without impairing its fusogenic activity. the modification was also compatible with virus infectivity. the labeled protein was also shown to be suitable for STED nanoscopy. the authors could show that the molecules are highly dynamic, reversibly interconverting between three distinct conformational states. the exploitation of GCE/click labeling, combined with single-molecule imaging, yielded biological information that could not have been obtained by any other approach. in this case, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. virus capsids are multimers of structural proteins; depending on the virus, they may comprise many monomers of a given protein. sensitivity may be increased by including more than one label per POI, but each additional position targeted by GCE/click labeling makes the system less efficient and increases the invasiveness of the approach. truncated version may interfere with the assembly, and thus be dominant negative, is high, and may need to be experimentally assessed. the efficiency of amber suppression depends on numerous variables including (i) the protein of choice, (ii) the cell type used, (iii) the method to deliver the bioorthogonal tRNA/aaRS pair and resulting expression levels of those components. studies should ideally be performed on cell types that closely mimic the natural host cell of the respective virus, preferably primary cells, which are often refractory to transfection. the fact that it is necessary to provide all components of the GCE system together with the virus in the same cell is an obstacle to the production of high virus yields. amber suppression is not specific to the codon that is experimentally introduced at the chosen site. all amber stop codons present in the cell in a suitable sequence context may, in principle, be recognized. these versions may exert dominant negative effects, resulting in the deregulation of cellular pathways and impairment of cell viability. non-targeted amber stop codons of viral genes may be converted to ochre or opal codons to avoid recognition by the GCE system. this advancement has been pioneered in E. coli [46] and is still under development for cell biological and virological applications. a small molecular footprint and suitable chemical properties of the modification may be crucial to retaining virus infectivity. a wide selection of organic fluorophores is available for labeling viral surface proteins. choices for capsids of enveloped proteins or for viral proteins within a producer cell are more limited. the cell-permeable, fluorogenic, near-infrared dye silicon rhodamine (SiR) and its derivatives, suitable for advanced microscopic applications, have set a paradigm. the criteria that define sites permissive for amber suppression using various tRNA/aaRS pairs have been identified in bacteria [35], but such information is currently lacking for eukaryotic cells. the proposed modification should ideally provide high particle yield and have no effect on virus infectivity. click-labeled HIV-1 Env on viral particles was below the limit of microscopic detection. sensitivity may be increased by including more than one label per POI. but each additional position targeted by GCE/click labeling makes the system less efficient. levels of orthogonal tRNAs [37], cytosolic localization of aaRS [38] and high intracellular concentrations of ncAAs [39] promote production of the engineered protein. the application of this strategy boosted amber suppression efficiency fourfold in the case of the Env glycoprotein of HIV-1 [32]. the majority of the cell population needs to be co-transfected with one or more viral expression constructs, plasmids expressing aaRS and (multiple copies of) tRNA, as well as possibly a plasmid expressing eRF1(E55D) [40]. sustaining high-level expression of the GCE system is challenging due to the interference of efficient stop codon suppression with cell viability. cytotoxicity and background labeling may hamper the application of GCE and click labeling for the study of intracellularly labeled viral proteins. the use of purified engineered viruses for the infection of native target cells circumvents potential toxic effects on the host cell. choice of ncAA and fluorophore has been pioneered in E. coli [46] and is still under development for cell biological and virological applications. the size of the ncAA and the chemical nature of the fluorophore and the length of linker between the moieties have to be considered. more fluorogenic, cell-permeable dyes are being developed. the efflux of SiR does not present a concern for extracellular labeling of genetically-engineered viruses. the opposite should be considered. dsDNA viruses have the ability to rely on the host cell machinery for genome replication. most dsDNA viruses replicate their genome in the nucleus with the help of cellular DNA polymerases. the replication sites of most RNA viruses are in the cytoplasmic area. the harsh treatment of samples required for FISH is often incompatible with immunofluorescence staining. extensive extraction within the cytoplasm may render FISH non-quantitative, thereby underrepresenting subviral structures. the site-specific expansion of the genetic alphabet has only been achieved in E. coli by using two unnatural nucleotides. the first approach was based on bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. followed by IF detection of incorporated BrdU to define active replicating viral genomes. this method provided the first evidence that DNA viruses like the herpes simplex virus 1 form replication compartments and recruit cellular replication machinery. nucleoside analogs are substrates for cellular polymerases and other metabolic enzymes. induction of cell cycle arrest, necrosis and general genome instability have indeed been described for the widely-used compound. IC50 values in the 1\u201310 M range determined for different cell lines upon 72 h incubation. me Detection All of the compounds described above can be ligated to azide-coupled fluorophores using CuAAC. resulting enhanced signal-to-noise ratio makes it possible to detect relatively small viral genomes. the lack of proofreading in RNA synthesis limits the size of RNA virus genomes, making them more difficult to detect. dsDNA viruses have the ability to rely on the host cell machinery for genome replication. most dsDNA viruses replicate their genome in the nucleus with the help of cellular DNA polymerases. the replication sites of most RNA viruses are in the cytoplasmic area. viruses form membrane-less replication compartments, which segregate from their surroundings by liquid-liquid phase separation. the harsh treatment of samples required for FISH is often incompatible with immunofluorescence staining. in many cases, FISH cannot distinguish between incoming genomes and de novo synthesized nucleic acids resulting from replication or transcription. genetic alphabet has only been achieved in E. coli by using two unnatural nucleotides. they form a third, unnatural base pair (UBP) besides the natural G-C and A-T. these UBPs can be retained during in vivo replication [57]. 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) was described in 2008 by Salic and Mitchison. this important contribution was followed by synthesis of other alkyne derivatives. ribonucleoside equivalent of EdU was developed to label nascent RNA. the purine nucleoside EdA was developed, which displayed 10 fold higher IC50 values than EdU in tissue culture. in contrast to EdU, the IC50 value of EdA did not change dramatically upon prolonged incubation, indicating a non-genotoxic mode of action. virological experiments are completed on a short time scale, where such cytotoxic effects may not be manifest. dsDNA genome contains 1.5 105 bp and forms replication compartments within the nucleus. lack of proofreading in RNA synthesis limits the size of RNA virus genomes. the large ssRNA genomes of coronaviruses have been successfully visualized by metabolic labeling and click chemistry. signals for vaccinia virus were only detectable using EdU. pronounced differences might be explained by different selectivities of the respective viral DNA polymerases. many viruses encode nucleoside or nucleotide modifying enzymes that either alter (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphate levels. the activity of the viral dUTPase and UNG enzymes may limit EdU incorporation. the presence of the bioorthogonal handle on the viral DNA enabled the authors to attach different functionalities to biochemical analysis and imaging. nascent DNA moved outwards, indicating the existence of functionally-separated subdomains within the viral RC. cells were infected with particles carrying EdC incorporated into the viral genome. the viral DNA was only occasionally detected inside the cytoplasm of infected cells, while nuclear signals were readily detectable. foreign DNA within the cytoplasm rapidly triggers innate immune responses leading to interferon (IFN) production. the uncoating step occurring at this site is accompanied by DNA decondensation, rendering the genome accessible for click labeling [72] incoming viral genomes are entrapped to prevent replication. failure to prevent viral DNA replication results in shift to antiviral state. dsDNA viruses generally replicate inside the nucleus and employ host cellular machinery. the click labeling of EdA/EdC labeled viral DNA could be exploited in the case of AdV to obtain information on the dynamics of the viral uncoating process. in humans, AdV may cause various types of infections (eye, respiratory or gastrointestinal tract) papillomaviruses (HPV) contribute to the etiology of many benign and malignant tumors, most notably to cervical cancer. the cellular entry of HPV is a complex process, involving endocytosis, endosomal acidification and activation of proteases, as well as transport to the trans Golgi network. a follow-up study analyzed the time required for HPV nuclear penetration. in cells synchronized in G2/M, EdU positive viral genomes associated with PML-NB inside the nucleus within only 1 h post infection. it remained unclear how HPV protected its genome from cytosolic antiviral defenses during endocytic trafficking. de novo synthesized vaccinia virus DNA can be efficiently labeled by EdU incorporation and click labeling within these cytoplasmic replication compartments. this finding was exploited by Yakimovich et al. [83] to characterize the effects of bisbenzimide dyes on the viral life cycle. retroviruses like HIV-1 convert their ssRNA genomes into dsDNA. this is a prerequisite for the integration of the proviral DNA into the host genome and for productive infection. all processes in this early post-entry phase appear to be temporally and spatially linked, and have to be tightly controlled. three-color PALM/dSTORM images reveal co-localization of nascent HIV-1 DNA in reverse transcription complexes with viral proteins CA and integrase. newly transcribed HIV-1 RNA co-localizes with a subset of EdU/click labeled HIV-1 DNA in the nucleus. images in (b\u2013e) were modified from the indicated references, with permission. a significant proportion, or even the vast majority, of particles entering a cell may end up in non-productive pathways, e.g., endosomal degradation. in case of HIV-1, the detection of nascent reverse transcription products by EdU incorporation and click labeling has been employed to identify particles undergoing productive reverse transcription. PC was found to be 40 nm [89], while the broad end of the conical HIV-1 capsid is around 60 nm wide [90]. further analyses are required to confirm this finding. authors identified delayed reverse transcription, caused by the depletion of the available dNTP pool by the host restriction factor SAM and HD domain-containing protein 1. some retroviruses encode the accessory protein Vpx which mediates proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. this may also enhance intracellular levels of clickable dNTPs. in recent years, the emergence of click chemistry has started to yield novel insights into the biology of some RNA viruses. ebolavirus inclusion bodies undergo a maturation process, accumulating components for efficient viral RNA replication. a combination of RNA click labeling and a correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approach would be of great interest. gradual development of viral factories has also been observed for coronaviruses (CoV) ing of de novo synthesized RNA is necessary to identify sites of ongoing CoV replication. the system was used to characterize the mode of action of a small molecule CoV inhibitor. it targets the viral RNP complex and blocks RNA replication as well as RdRP and nucleocapsid synthesis. NSs protein of the related but less virulent toscana Virus (TSV) had no effect on host cell transcription. strategy detects all nascent DNA (or RNA molecules) this can present significant difficulties for detecting signals from individual viral particles. novel nucleosides that can be click-labeled under live cell conditions would be beneficial not only for virological studies, but also for cell biology in general. novel nucleosides that can be efficiently click-labeled under live cell conditions with rapid kinetics would be beneficial. comparisons of HSV-1, AdV and the poxvirus vaccinia revealed differences in nucleoside analog preferences. differences in nucleoside analog preferences were only detectable using EdU and less efficiently with EdC. RC creates replication compartments that provide an ideal environment to synthesize large amounts of progeny DNA, transcribe mRNA to produce viral proteins, and assemble newly-formed capsids with viral dsDNA. the activity of the viral dUTPase and UNG enzymes may limit EdU incorporation. nascent DNA moved outwards, indicating the existence of functionally-separated subdomains within the viral RC. nascent DNA moved outwards, indicating the existence of functionally-separated subdomains within the viral RC. labeling of nascent AdV DNA in the nucleus of virus producing cells shows relocalization of labeled DNA from the periphery to the core of viral replication centers from 20\u201324 h post infection. the incoming viral genome is protected in vesicles during anaphase and becomes accessible upon completion of mitosis. incoming viral genomes are entrapped to prevent replication. failure to prevent viral DNA replication results in shift to antiviral state. dsDNA viruses generally replicate inside the nucleus and employ host cellular machinery. viral enzyme, 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (dF-EdU) is only incorporated into DNA in HSV-1 infected cells. the click labeling of EdA/EdC labeled viral DNA could be exploited in the case of AdV to obtain information on the dynamics of the viral uncoating process. papillomaviruses (HPV) contribute to the etiology of many benign and malignant tumors. the cellular entry of HPV is a complex process, involving endocytosis, endosomal acidification and activation of proteases, as well as transport to the trans Golgi network (TGN) the authors initially used BrdU for the detection of viral genomes. but switched to EdU because the detection via CuAAC was more sensitive. in cells synchronized in G2/M, EdU positive viral genomes associated with PML-NB inside the nucleus within only 1 h post infection. authors speculate that HPV hijacks vesicles during fragmentation of ER and TGN in mitosis. vaccinia virus and other poxviruses belong to the group of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. this finding was exploited by Yakimovich et al. to characterize the effects of bisbenzimide dyes on the viral life cycle. two spots of D5 were observed to be associated with the long sides of incoming viral cores by SIM. this suggests that these D5 foci might serve as portals to release the viral DNA. recent insights into herpes simplex Virus Biology are Fueled by click Chemistry. viral DNA was pulled down upon click coupling to biotin-azide. over 200 cellular and viral proteins selectively recruited to HSV-1 RCs. abundant chromatin remodeling complexes, but no histones, were detected in these experiments. the differential labeling suggested that the DNA contained in the viral capsid was inaccessible to the fluorophore. DNA ejected in the nucleus after viral uncoating at the NPC could be readily chemically modified. this assumption was confirmed by comparing staining of native virions with particles that had undergone in vitro induced uncoating. HSV-1 antagonizes antiviral proteins by proteasomal degradation. incoming incoming viral genomes are entrapped to prevent replication. failure to prevent viral DNA replication results in shift to an antiviral state. HSV-1 infection with a very low MOI coincident with EdC pulse incorporation and click labeling of cellular DNA. this was attributed to a paracrine effector, which was stimulated by HSV-1 infection. cellular DNA synthesis was drastically enhanced in uninfected bystander cells. cell free particles carrying alkyne-modified genomes were refractory to click labeling. signals were readily detected for the majority of entering capsid positive complexes in the cytosol at 30 min post infection. only one third of capsid-containing viral particles remained associated with the viral DNA. the authors identified proteins that are important in the regulation of the cell cycle and mitosis. the authors initially used BrdU for the detection of viral genomes, but switched to EdU, because the detection via CuAAC was more sensitive. a sequential double click strategy of EdU tagged incoming viral genomes to determine that the HPV genome is found within a protective vesicle throughout the whole process of mitosis. they first partially permeabilized the plasma membrane and early endosomes using low digitonin concentrations. then, samples were fully permeabilized followed by click labeling with the membrane impermeable Alexa Fluor 550 (AF550)-azide dye. the authors identified molecules from this class as specific inhibitors of vaccinia virus infectivity. they observed that the compounds affected intermediate and late viral gene expression, which requires viral DNA replication. the compounds affected intermediate and late viral gene expression, which requires viral DNA replication. a viral nucleoprotein complex is transported through the NPC into the nucleus (v) and serves as a template for transcription of viral RNA (vi) three-color PALM/dSTORM images reveal co-localization of nascent HIV-1 DNA in reverse transcription complexes with the viral proteins CA and integrase. virions click-labeled with different fluorophores at different components would be an ideal approach to study spatial and temporal relationships between reverse transcription, trafficking and uncoating. click labeling of HIV-1 genomic RNA, as well as of newly reverse-transcribed DNA, has been achieved in fixed samples. the sensitivity of the metabolic labeling procedure was sufficient to detect individual HIV-1 reverse transcription products (10 kb) within subviral complexes. the degree of labeling provides an estimate for the progression of the reverse transcription process. reverse transcription may enhance the efficiency of nuclear entry. some retroviruses could potentially increase the efficiency of modified deoxynucleotide incorporation into their genomes by degrading SAMHD1. eled Viral RNA to Monitor HIV-1 uncoating has been achieved in fixed samples. virions click-labeled with different fluorophores at different components would be an ideal approach to study spatial and temporal relationships between reverse transcription, trafficking and uncoating. click labeling of HIV-1 genomic RNA and newly reverse-transcribed DNA has been achieved in fixed samples. the sensitivity of the metabolic labeling procedure was sufficient to detect individual HIV-1 reverse transcription products (10 kb) within subviral complexes. the degree of labeling provides an estimate for the progression of the reverse transcription process. reverse transcription may enhance the efficiency of nuclear entry. some retroviruses could potentially increase the efficiency of modified deoxynucleotide incorporation into their genomes by degrading SAMHD1. emergence of click chemistry has started to yield novel insights into the biology of some RNA viruses. the technology has not yet been used as frequently as for DNA viruses. the detection of small RNA virus genomes by metabolic labeling usually requires blocking of cellular RNA transcription using actinomycin D. viral RNA co-localizes with viral proteins in large cytosolic inclusion bodies. modified from [93], with permission. gradual development of viral factories has also been observed for coronaviruses. system for following virus replication by metabolic/click labeling is yet to be established. a general viral strategy is to hijack metabolic pathways in order to redirect cellular resources towards the generation of new viral particles. nucleoside analogs that are preferential substrates for the viral polymerase of interest would overcome this obstacle. aphidicolin also blocks DNA polymerases of some viruses (e.g., HSV-1 or vaccinia virus) aphidicolin also blocks DNA polymerases of some viruses. nucleosides bearing vinyl- [103] or azidomethyl groups [104] have been developed to allow copper-independent click labeling of DNA under live cell conditions. the efficient click labeling of these analogs requires the denaturation of samples with hydrochloric acid, precludes live cell applications."}
