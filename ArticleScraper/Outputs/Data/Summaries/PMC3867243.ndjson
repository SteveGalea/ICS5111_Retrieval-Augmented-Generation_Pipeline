{"summary": "inflammatory bowel disease, microparticulate drug carriers are expected to accumulate at the sites of inflammation in the colon. guar gum is metabolised by the colonic microflora that releases its contents specifically to the colon. a newer amine derivative of guar gum has been synthesised from commercially available guar flour. triterpene saponin found from root extract of glycyrrhiza glabra. glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium salt (GA) was used as model drug. in vivo efficacy of microparticles was studied in a rat model of colitis. analysis of all three inflammatory parameters was carried out to study the efficacy of the GA microparticles in the amelioration of colonic ulcer. the results were corroborated by the histological studies of the colon tissue of the normal, control, and treated groups of animals. the final product was purified by dialysis against millipore water for 48 hours. aliquot of 0.1% GGAA solution was taken in a glass homogeniser. a 0.1% GA solution was added dropwise to the GGAA solution. the homogenisation was further continued for 30 minutes in an ice bath. chromatographic determinations were carried out on a waters (Waters, USA) binary gradient system equipped with a Waters 515 pump (two numbers), a manual Rheodyne injector port attached with a 20l loop. the separation was carried out in a reversed-phase Kromasil C18 column (125mm 4.0mm, 5; Akzonobel, USA) 4% Rat Cecal Content Medium Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were asphyxiated by excessive inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) [29] the abdomens were opened and the cecum were traced, legated at both ends, dissected, and immediately transferred to the simulated colonic fluid [8] previously bubbled with CO2. the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. the amount of GA released at regular intervals was estimated by the HPLC method mentioned under the drug entrapment study. in vitro drug release in simulated colonic fluid was monitored first at 30mins and then every hour. 9 F4 2:10 0 1 68.7 2.09 91.7 1.23 92.8 1.11 96.41 2.34 5.5 1.2 5.0\u20137.9 F5 2:15 0 0 57.8 1.98 87.4 2.51 92.3 1.01 94.56 1.65 5.9 2.9 5.2\u20138.0 F6e 2:20 0 1 47.9 1.69 81.4 1.98 84.9 0.98 95.63 3.65 6.5 3.9 6.0\u20138.2 i = b 0 + b 1 X 1 + b 2 X 2 + b 12 X 1 X 2 + b 11 X 1 2 + b 22 X 2 2 Eq. 2 Where b0 denotes the arithmetic mean response for nine runs, bi (i = 1, 2) denotes the estimated coefficient for the factors and Xi (i = 1, 2) denotes the effect of changing one factor at a time from its lowest to highest level the animals in the treatment group received either 1.0ml of the suspension of GAM in saline or at a dose equivalent to 50mg of GAM per kg body weight once daily. the void control group received the void microparticle suspension. the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after administration of the last drug/GAM dose. guar gum and all other reagents used for synthesis of alkyl amine derivatives were purchased from Merck India Ltd. male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept on a normal diet with water ad libitum. they were acclimatized for seven days before any treatment. GAMs were characterized by their shape and particle size. a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used for the physical characterization of the GAMs. the particle size was determined by measuring the diameters of 100 particles chosen at random. the standard, sample, and mobile phase (mixture of 35% acetonitrile and 65% phosphate buffer (pH = 3.0), prepared by dissolving potassium phosphate monobasic 2.1012g and potassium phosphate dibasic 1.0852g in 1000ml water, adjusted to pH=3.0 using orthophosphoric acid, was filtered through a 0.2m membrane filter. the column effluent was monitored at 252nm with PDA detection. in vitro drug release study carried out in simulated gastric fluid of pH 1.2. simulated intestinal fluid of pH 6.8 and simulated colonic fluid of pH 7.4 were dispersed in 1.5 ml of the simulated biological fluids placed in dialysis bags. both ends were sealed with a clean thread. formulation d/p ratio X1b X2b Q240c (%) Q720c (%) Q1440c (%) % Drug entrapmentd Average particle size (m) Size distribution (min\u2013max, m) F1 3:20 1 1 70.4 2.36 93.9 2.45 95.8 1.23 98.36 4.65 4.9 3.8 3.8\u20138.6 F2e 3:30 1 0 60.8 2.95 90.2 2.11 94.9 1.87 95. 0 54.4 2.99 89.5 2.56 91.8 2.58 82.36 4.32 5.8 5.2 5.0\u20137.5 F9 1:8 1 1 43.5 2.56 76.9 3.75 82.9 1.65 80.98 1.98 6.9 3.9 6.1\u20139.2 b X1 indicates the amount of GA in mg and X2 the amount of GGAA in mg. the TNBS rat model is a recognized model for the induction of experimental colitis with a very low mortality rate. the inflammation was induced in male SD rats by instilling 0.85 ml of the TNBS-ethanol mixture into the lumen of the colon using a baby feeding tube. the animals in the treatment group received either 1.0ml of the suspension of GAM in saline or GAM at a dose equivalent to 50mg of GAM per kg body weight once the colons were examined for the visual severity of the colitis. they were expressed as a ratio with the respective body weights. the level of malondialdehyde was determined as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. vs. concentration in g/ml (along axis) graph for GA was first prepared (y = 21493 + 22074, R2= 0.9995) the mass of GA in solution before and after the microparticulation in supernatant was determined by the HPLC experiments. the bag was suspended in 40ml of the respective simulated fluid taken in a tube. the release medium was taken out and replaced with fresh dissolution medium. the amount of GA released at regular intervals was estimated by the HPLC method mentioned under the drug entrapment study. 5.0 2.7 4.7\u20136.9 F3 3:40 1 1 55.8 1.56 83.9 2.39 89.9 2.03 97.45 1.23 6.9 4.1 6.1\u20138.9 F4 2:10 0 1 68.7 2.09 91.7 1.23 92.8 1.11 96.41 2.34 5.5 1.2 5.0\u20137.9 F5 2:15 0 0 57.8 1.98 87.4 2.51 92.3 1.01 94.56 amount of drug and polymer at different levels of factorial design study Levels GA(mg) [X1] GGAA(mg) [X2] 1 7.5 50 0 10 75 1 12.5 100 Y i = b 0 + b 1 X 1 + b 2 X 2 + b 12 X 1 X 2 + b 11 X 1 2 + b 22 X 2 2 Eq. 2 Where b0 denotes the estimated coefficient the animals in the treatment group received either 1.0ml of the suspension of GAM in saline or GAM at a dose equivalent to 50mg of GAM per kg body weight once daily. their abdomens were cut open and the colon was legated at both ends. the colon was resected, cleaned, and preserved till further use. GGAA was synthesised, purified, and subjected to IR Spectroscopic analysis. the dried purified product was used for the preparation of GAMs. the microparticles were prepared by ionic crosslinking by using sodium tripolyphosphate. GAMs prepared with GGAA were characterized by the absence of distinct diffraction peaks of GA and a peak for the polymer at 20.29\u00b0. the average drug entrapment varied from 75.36 5.69% to 98.36 4.65% of the total drug used for each GAM formulation. Fig. 6, 7 and 8 demonstrate GA release profiles from GAMs in three different mediums of pH 1.2, 6.8 and 7.4 respectively. in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, only about 10% of the drug was released in the first 600 mins of the study. a minimum drug release in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid implies a minimal chance of the drug molecule getting adsorbed to the surface of the microparticle. a proper entrapment of GA might be predicted from the study. the release profile predicts the dependence of the cumulative drug release on the drug-polymer ratio. 167 0.0071 X2 9.9500 0.0001 5.6167 0.0056 3.7167 0.0020 X1X2 2.4250 0.0076 0.6167 0.4413 0.6500 0.2437 X1 0.6500 0.3090 2.6833 0.6806 1.1167 0.1770 X2X2 1.3500 0.0848 0.8500 0.1427 3.3833 0.0129 Q 240 = + 57.23 - 3.55 X 1 - 9.95 response surface regression analysis was performed using coded values of factor levels (1, 0, +1) for each factor to understand the contribution of each independent variable. response surface plots were presented in Fig. 9, 10 and 11 corresponding to release at 240 minutes, 720 minutes and 1440 minutes respectively. in-vivo efficacy study was carried out with the optimized formulation F4 having drug/polymer ratio 2:10. the therapeutic efficacy of this optimized GAM formulation was studied on TNBS induced rat model of colitis. the animals under study were divided into six groups \u2013 normal control, solvent control, TNBS control, Void control, GA and GAM groups. both GA and GAM recovered the colon length from shortening which was more significant for GAM. the colon to body weight ratio for the TNBS control group was 8.34 and was much lower than the TNBS control group 20.84 (Tab 5). encapsulation of GA within the microparticles in formulation F4 showed greater efficacy in the amelioration of colitis. the studied biological parameters present enhanced efficacy of GAMs over free GA. the visual severity of colitis presented minimum damage of colonic mucosa in case of GAM treated animals compared with GA treated group. particle size varies from 4.9 3.8m to 6.9 3.9 m (Tab. 1A) study by lampretch et al. shows bioadhesion of microparticle carriers to the inflamed colonic mucosa depends on the size of the microparticle. particle sizes smaller than 200m were found to show prolonged passage time. GAMs prepared with GGAA were characterized by the absence of the distinct diffraction peaks of GA and a peak for the polymer at 20.29\u00b0. the diffraction pattern of the physical mixtures presented the lowering in peak intensities of the intact drug due to the dilution effect of the polymer. in the simulated gastric fluid, only about 10% of the drug was released in the first 600 mins of the study for all nine formulations. the percentage cumulative drug release varied from 43.52.56% to 70.42.36%. after 720 minutes it varied from 76.93.75% to 93.92.45%. the release profile predicts the dependence of the cumulative drug release on the drug-polymer ratio. the release profile predicts the dependence of the cumulative drug release on the drug-polymer ratio. 1.3500 0.0848 0.8500 0.1427 3.3833 0.0129 Q 240 = + 57.23 - 3.55 X 1 - 9.95 X 2 - 2.42 X 1 X 2 + 0.65 X 1 2 + 1.35 X 2 2 Eq. 3 Q 720 = + 88.62 - 1.88 X 1 - 5.62 X 2 - 0.85 X 1 X 2 + 0.62 X 1 2 - 2.68 9, 10 and 11 corresponding to release at 240 minutes, 720 minutes and 1440 minutes respectively. the formulation was optimized on the basis of observed and predicted values of the responses. the animals under study were divided into six groups. the normal control group was kept to study the normal condition of colon. the solvent control group was kept to study whether the solvent used had any adverse effect. the void control group was kept to study the possible effect of the delivery device itself. tissue biochemical parameters namely tissue nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde presented a much lower value for those treated with GA and GAM compared to the TNBS control group. encapsulation of GA within the microparticles in formulation F4 showed greater efficacy in the amelioration of colitis. TNBS control group showed presence of inflammatory cells and moderate improvement with granulated tissue formation. a sharp shift was observed from 1043.3cm1 in the GA spectrum to 1064 cm1 in the formulation. a higher localized delivery of the drug to the affected colonic tissue may have reduced the extent of ulcer formation. primary alcohol and its shift to 1064 cm1 was due to a hydrogen bonding interaction between GA and GGAA. diffraction pattern of the physical mixtures presented the lowering in peak intensities of the intact drug due to the dilution effect of the polymer. Fig. 6, 7 and 8 demonstrate GA release profiles from GAMs. in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, only about 10% of the drug was released in the first 600 mins of the study for all nine formulations. a minimum drug release in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid implies a minimal chance of the drug molecule getting adsorbed to the surface of the microparticle. thus, a proper entrapment of GA might be predicted from the study. the release profile predicts the dependence of the cumulative drug release on the drug-polymer ratio. 2.4167 0.0071 X2 9.9500 0.0001 5.6167 0.0056 3.7167 0.0020 X1X2 2.4250 0.0076 0.6167 0.4413 0.6500 0.2437 X1 0.6500 0.3090 2.6833 0.6806 1.1167 0.1770 X2X2 1.3500 0.0848 0.8500 0.1427 3.3833 0.0129 Q 240 = + 57.23 - 3.55 X 1 - response surface regression analysis was performed using coded values of factor levels (1, 0, +1) for each factor to understand the contribution of each independent variable. response surface plots were presented in Fig. 9, 10 and 11 corresponding to release at 240 minutes, 720 minutes and 1440 minutes respectively. 720 91.70 91.55 0.15 Q1440 92.80 92.59 0.21 In-vivo efficacy study was carried out with the optimized formulation F4 having drug/polymer ratio 2:10. the animals under study were divided into six groups \u2013 normal control, solvent control, TNBS control, Void control, GA and GAM groups. the normal control group was kept to study whether the solvent used had any adverse effect. both GA and GAM recovered the colon length from shortening. the colon to body weight ratio was 8.34 and was much lower than the TNBS control group 20.84 (Tab 5). the tissue biochemical parameters namely tissue nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde presented a much lower value for those treated with GA and GAM.
