{"summary": "AR is associated with impairments in how patients function in day-to-day life at home, at work, and in school. it has been suggested that oxidative stress is a crucial event in perennial AR. glycyrrhizin reduces IgE levels in serum and Th2 cytokines. reduces OVA specific IgE levels in serum and Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5 in BAL fluid. animals male, Kunming mice (28\u201333 g, body weight, BW), 2\u20133 month-old, were kept in polyacrylic cages with ten animals per cage and housed in a room under controlled temperature (24\u201326 \u00b0C), relative humidity (50\u201360%) dripping ovalbumin in physiological saline into bilateral nasal cavities using a micropipette. six rats from each group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. plasma was prepared by low-speed centrifugation (1000 g for 20 min, 4 \u00b0C) saline was removed immediately, rinsed with cold saline, weighed and stored at 70 \u00b0C until use. one unit of CAT activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to decompose 1 moL of hydrogen peroxide in 1 min. the enzyme activity was expressed as moL H2O2 consumed/min/mg protein. the IFN- level was measured using IL-4 ELISA Kit from Diaclone Research, France. the significance of differences between means of the TAA determined were examined by one-way ANOVA using the general linear model procedure. mice were sensitized by subcutaneous injection (sc) with 1 mg antigen ovalbumin mixed with 80 mg aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in 1 mL saline at footpad, neck, back and groin on the first day. all procedures were in accordance with china\u2019s national animal care guidelines. the homogenates were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to yield a clear supernatant fraction. the homogenates were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to yield a clear supernatant fraction that was used for the biochemical analysis. activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was determined according to the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich [21]. the reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 mL of 7.5 mM EDTA. in untreated AR mice, sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by excessive scratching. in glycyrrhizin-treated groups, sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by slightly scratching. in lycopene-treated groups, sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by slightly scratching. glycyrrhizin 30 mg kg1 37.94 2.51 a P 0.01, compared with NC group. oral administration of lycopene slightly reduced OVA specific IgE levels in untreated AR mice compared to normal control mice. group blood nasal mucosa MDA (nmol/mg protein) MDA (nmol/mg protein) NC 5.34 0.09 4.93 0.09 MC 7.85 0.08 b 8.35 0.13 b lycopene 20 mg kg1 5.12 0.09 d 5.18 0.03 d glycyrrhizin 10 mg kg1 7.15 0.06 c 6.76 0.14 d glycyrrhizin 30 mg kg1 6.77 group blood nasal mucosa GSH (nmol/mg protein) GSH (nmol/mg protein) NC 8.04 0.32 5.43 0.11 MC 3.32 0.11 b 2.97 0.09 b lycopene 20 mg kg1 7.57 0.12 d 6.03 0.11 d glycyrrhizin 10 mg kg1 5.76 0.15 d 3.89 0.08 d glycyrrhizin 20 mg kg1 6.43 TAOC (U/mg protein) NC 198.4 4.98 23.09 0.98 15.02 0.76 10.87 0.35 MC 154.2 7.34 b 17.56 0.89 b 9.03 0.09 b 7.45 0.42 b lycopene 20 mg kg1 253.6 9.04 d 23.98 0.16 d 18.85 0.13 d 12.09 0.35 d glycyrrhizin 10 mg kg1 160.4 5.09 d 19.85 0. d 22.13 1.09 d 21.03 0.27 d 11.32 0.09 d glycyrrhizin 10 mg kg1 179.4 5.1 d 16.84 0.78 d 14.07 0.13 d 7.07 0.08 d glycyrrhizin 20 mg kg1 195.6 8.9 d 18.03 0.67 d 16.48 0.24 d 8.25 0.07 d glycyrrhizin 30 mg kg a significantly lower plasma and nasal mucosa total antioxidant status in untreated AR mice. we found a significantly lower plasma and nasal mucosa total antioxidant status in untreated AR mice. glycyrrhizin is reported to exhibit antiviral [26], anti-HIV [27,28], antitumor [29], antioxidant [30] and immunomodulatory activity [27,29] studies conducted earlier with glycyrrhizin have shown it to counteract CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity with the anti-oxidative potential. treatment with glycyrrhizin and Lycopene led to significant increases in the above mentioned enzymes. the use of glycyrrhizin in the therapy of AR allows oxidative stress to be abolished or reduced by correcting the antioxidant system. Lycopene reduced the increased levels of IL-4 in OVA-challenged mice. this suggests that lycopene treatment is a novel, selective way to simultaneously suppress GATA-3 and increase T-bet expression in asthmatic reactions in vivo. glycyrrhizin consumption decreases blood and nasal mucosa antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation and GSH levels. in AR mice glycyrrhizin consumption decreases blood and nasal mucosa antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation and GSH levels."}
