{"summary": "infections are caused by microbial pathogens from different domains of the tree of life\u2014viruses, bacteria, or eukaryotes. each pathogen produces a distinct set of virulence factors that target specific host cell structures, pathways, and molecules. extracellular pathogens produce virulence factors that act at a distance or on contact with a host cell. pathogen virulence factors are the same systems studied by most cell biologists. they include cytoskeleton, organelles and membrane-trafficking intermediates, signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulators, the organelle and protein recycling machinery. these pathways include those involved in membrane trafficking, autophagy, cell death, and cell-death pathways. pathogens, e.g., C. botulinum, C. tetani; many intracellular pathogens, e.g., T. cruzi, L. pneumophila SNARE proteins, Rab proteins, Arf proteins Asrat et al., 2014 Signal transduction Growth/replication Many pathogens, e.g., vaccinia virus, RSV, A-MuLV Tyrosine kinases, other kina the study of pathogens and their virulence factors has been fertile ground for uncovering basic cell biological principles and mechanisms. the study of pathogens has been fertile ground for uncovering basic cell biology principles and mechanisms. study of pathogens that mobilize actin for movement led to discovery of fundamental mechanisms of cytoskeletal dynamics and regulation. pathogens include the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, and Escherichia coli, as well as vaccinia virus, which is the smallpox vaccine strain. bacterial pathogens C. botulinum and Clostridium tetani secrete tetanus toxin. toxins specifically cleave SNARE protein components of vesicle fusion machinery. bacterial toxins were used in discovering fundamental mechanisms of membrane fusion and vesicular transport. trypanosoma cruzi is a eukaryotic parasite and the causative agent of Chagas disease. the parasite contacts the plasma membrane of a host cell before invasion. intracellular Ca2+ is elevated, and cellular lysosomes are recruited to the point of contact between the parasite and host cell. lysosomes participate in exocytosis at the invasion site. pRb releases bound transcription factor E2F, which activates expression of cell cycle regulatory genes that promote entry into S phase. other viruses target different cell cycle regulators, including Cdks and cyclins. studying how viruses manipulate host cells will continue to reveal cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. viruses were key to demonstrating the importance of tyrosine kinases in signaling in normal and cancer cells and the roles of oncogenes in cancer. future studies of pathogens will continue to reveal ways in which diverse signaling pathways and proteins influence normal cell physiology and disease. study of such areas is of increasing importance in understanding general mechanisms of pathogenesis. the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) normally resides within an endosome-like compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) however, observation of the bacteria that occasionally damage the SCV enabled the discovery of previously unknown mechanisms by which pathogens are targeted to autophagy. actin and septins play a stimulatory role in autophagy inhibition. this suggests a potential role for actin in autophagy inhibition. this suggests a potential role for actin in autophagy inhibition. bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine used to combat tuberculosis caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis consists of an attenuated strain of the related bacterium Mycobacterium bovis. a similar phenomenon was observed for the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, a live attenuated virus that is almost always effective in protecting against infection with the yellow fever virus. antiviral, antibacterial, and antiparasitic drugs are commonly used to treat infections. targeting host molecules appears to be an emerging strategy for the development of drugs to treat infections. antibacterial agents that target host cell molecules are also being explored. they will be particularly useful in cases for which there is no effective vaccine. a list can be compiled of FDA-approved drugs that target host molecules. host hepatocytes, Plasmodium suppresses the expression of the cell cycle regulator and proapoptotic protein p53. it increases the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, thus preventing host cell apoptosis. developing drugs that target host components is a viable strategy to combat infectious diseases. potential benefits include increased flexibility in developing combination therapies and reduced capacity of the pathogens to become resistant to drug treatment. research at the interface between microbiology, cell biology, and immunology will be an increasingly important source of information and innovation relevant to biology in general and infectious disease in particular."}
