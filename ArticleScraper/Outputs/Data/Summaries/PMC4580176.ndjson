effect or viral replication was detected. nsp3, S, ORF3, and ORF8 regions are known to be the most rapidly evolving regions among SARSr-CoV genomes (27, 28, 52, 53) nsp3, S, ORF3, and ORF8 regions are known to be the most rapidly evolving regions among SARSr-CoV genomes (27, 28, 52, 53) civet SARSr-CoV SZ3 was most closely related to SARSr-Rs-BatCoV Rs3367 and WIV1 in S and ORF3a. however, civet SARSr-CoV SZ3 was most closely related to SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs in ORF8. 99.6 90.1 96.7 99.1 97.7 33.0 99.5 SARSr-Rs-BatCoV WIV1 97.8 96.8 99.7 99.5 92.3 96.3 99.6 97.7 32.2 99.8 SARSr-Rs-BatCoV HKU3-1

identified five critical residues for ACE2 binding in human and civet SARSr-CoVs. residues 479 and 487 are the two key residues that are different between human and civet SARSr-CoVs. in SARSr-Rf-BatCoV Rs3367, two (residues 479 and 491) of the five critical residues were conserved. the five critical residues for receptor binding in human SARS-CoV are highlighted in yellow. phylogenetic trees were constructed using nsp2, nsp3, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12 (RdRp), S, ORF3a, ORF8, and N genes of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C and other SARSr-BatCoVs nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, RdRp, S, ORF3, ORF8, and N gene nucleotide sequences of SARSr-BatCoVs from different bat species. trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using GTR+G (A), GTR+G (B), GTR+G+I (C), TN93+G (D), GTR+G (E), TN93+G (F), T92 +G human/civet SARSr-CoV strains were clustered with human and civet SARSr-CoV strains with a bootstrap value of 990. the ORF8 of civet and human SARSr-CoV originated from SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs from greater horseshoe bats instead of SARSr-Rs-BatCoV from Chinese horseshoe bats. civet SARSr-CoV SZ3 was shown to have much higher sequence similarities to SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs within ORF8 than to SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs within ORF8. a gapless nucleotide alignment was generated with ClustalX. bases conserved between civet SARSr-CoV SZ03 and SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs (strains YNLF_31C and Rf1) are marked in green boxes. the 29-nt deletion in human SARS coronavirus TOR2 is highlighted in orange. another region of interest was S, which was situated between two breakpoints at positions 20900 and 26100. positive selection was particularly strong at the S (Ka/Ks = 3) and ORF3 (Ka/Ks = 2) regions of civet SARSr-CoVs and the M (Ka/Ks = 2) and ORF8 (Ka/Ks = 3.5) regions of human SARS-CoVs.

1999.1 to 2002.5) the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of all SARSr-CoVs was estimated to be 1961.5. the tMRCA of human and civet SARSr-CoVs was estimated to be 2000.7 (HPDs, 1996.7 to 2002.6). the leader TRS and the ORF8 subgenomic mRNA exactly matched each other. the leader TRS and the ORF8 subgenomic mRNA exactly matched each other. the leader TRS was confirmed as the first 66 nt of the genome. t SARSr-CoV and SARSr-Rs-BatCoV strains YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C showed the highest amino acid identities to that of civet SARSr-CoV SZ3. phylogenetic analysis of the ORF8 revealed a distinct clade formed by human/civet SARSr-CoVs and SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs. recombination is key mechanism involved in acquisition of ORF8 by ancestor of civet SARSr-CoVs. previous studies have demonstrated frequent recombination events between SARSr-Rp-BatCoV strains from different bat species of different geographical locations in China. the time of divergence between human/civet and bat SARSr-CoVs ranged from 4 to 17 years before the SARS epidemic (22, 55, 57) previous molecular dating studies estimated that the time of divergence between human/civet and bat SARSr-CoVs ranged from 4 to 17 years before the SARS epidemic. r-BatCoVs and SARS-Rs-BatCoVs are widely distributed throughout china. greater horseshoe bats are also widely distributed across different provinces. they are not found in Guangdong, the province with the highest biodiversity. the ORF8 region, unique to SARSr-CoVs, is prone to mutations or deletions during interspecies transmission. one of the most striking genomic changes observed in SARS-CoV soon after its zoonotic transmission to humans was the acquisition of a characteristic 29-nt deletion which splits ORF8 into two ORFs. the 8b protein downregulates the expression of the E protein, which supports a modulatory role in viral replication (68). overexpression of the 8b protein also plays a role in the host ubiquitin-proteasome system (71). six samples from daubenton's bats (M. daubentonii) contained viruses most closely related to My-BatCoV HKU6. 78 to 99% nucleotide identities in the partial RdRp region. this may represent my-BatCoV HKU6 or related viruses previously reported for the same bat species (38). the two samples from Pomona roundleaf bats contained potentially novel CoVs that are closely related to BatCoV HKU10 or variants of BatCoV HKU10 due to interspecies transmission."}
