{"summary": "china and the international community have made considerable progress in unraveling the causative pathogens and transmission route to emerging respiratory infectious diseases. from SARS to H7N9, the time cost for tracking the transmission route has been substantially shortened, which significantly improved prevention and control of emerging respiratory infectious diseases. effective anti-viral therapy to prevent such a fierce response of cytokine. ACE inhibitors and autophagic inhibitors are probable to reduce the virus-induced pulmonary injury. the clinical marketed drugs such as Losartan, Valsartan, Irbesartan, Olmesartan, candesartan and angiotensin AT1R inhibitor are advisable in the treatment of H7N9 victims. the application of NIV in critical patients at early stage can decrease the intubation rate and increase the survival rate. the convalescent plasma transfusion is proved effective to save critical patients. however, this still lacks clinical proofs. corticosteroid has clinical and radiological responses and effect on the suppression of cytokines. but it still needs to be cautiously used because of its side effects such as reduced viral clearance, increased bacterial superinfections, metabolic complications of hyper-glycaemia, hypertension, hypokalemia. more than 12 novel CoVs in many types of animals have a unique immune system allowing them to shed virus for prolonged period with no symptoms. in 2007 we discovered close relatives of the novel SARS-like virus called human Coronavirus EMC (hCoV-EMC) in the Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5. the new medicine against cold and influenza, Lianhua Qingwen Capsule, is developed. it has the functions of broad-spectrum antivirus and apparent inhibition of influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, H1N1, H3N2, SARS, H5N1, H9N2, and EV71. it effectively inhibits various bacteria to facilitate the treatment of polyinfection. china and the international community have made considerable progress in unraveling the causative pathogens and transmission route to these emerging respiratory infectious diseases. china along with the international community has made considerable progress in unraveling the causative pathogens and transmission route to these emerging respiratory infectious diseases. signal channel can control the cascade release of cytokines caused by SARS-CoV or H5N1 thus reducing lung injury. the effect of SARS virus on ACE2 receptor leads to the disorder of renin-angiotensin, consequently resulting in organ damage. the clinical marketed drugs such as Losartan, Valsartan, Irbesartan, candesartan, candesartan and angiotensin AT1R inhibitor are advisable in transfusion is proved effective to save critical patients (e.g., the patients with H5N1 and H1N1), yet the plasma source is limited. the public and scientists have attached much more alertness and importance to emerging respiratory diseases, and the transparency of information has been tremendously improved. high viral replication and its inflammatory response are central to the pathogenesis of human-avian influenza. high viral replication and its inflammatory response are central to the pathogenesis of human-avian influenza. in clinical practices, we should focus on early diagnosis and effective anti-viral therapy. neuraminidase (NA) intravenous agent was used in china for the first time. ten years ago, we concluded that as long as the adrenocortical hormone was applied to the right patients with the right dose at the right time, the survival rate could be elevated. but this conclusion failed to be proved in saving critical patients with H5N1 and H1N1. there is still no therapy for SARS-Cov infection, but some medicines have certain effect on the treatment of SARS according to the clinical experience in the outbreak of SARS and related studies. some follow-up studies in human beings and animals confirm interferons\u2019s function on SARS. despite coverage by N95 or surgical mask respectively, isolation rooms with negative pressure or adequately ventilated single rooms important for high risk patients. more information about prudent isolation of the patient coupled with protective measures for care providers and other patients are introduced on WHO guidelines. tracheotomy and NIV should be taken, such as, avoiding high pressure during NIV via single circuit especially connection to whisper swivel device. significant sideway dispersion to 13 and 23 cm occurs during coughing despite coverage by surgical mask respectively. we discuss the importance of these findings in relation to the presently looming epidemic at the Middle East in this lecture. we discuss the importance of these findings in relation to the presently looming epidemic at the Middle East in this lecture. study on

about the prevention and control of epidemic diseases, which accumulate abundant experience for the prevention and control of viral respiratory infectious diseases. 256 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Oseltamivir-controlled clinical studies led by Beijing You An Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University during the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009. the results come from 256 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, randomized,. double-blind, Oseltamivir-controlled clinical studies led by Beijing You An Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University during the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009. the state key laboratory of Respiratory Disease has explored how to rapidly design and construct antigen without pathogen. if there are no convalescents, we can first immunize macaque, then quickly screen and manufacture the monoclonal neutralizing antibody from macaque by B-cell clone. the anti-HA7 serum has already been produced from immunized mice. its antibody can neutralize the H7N7 virus. because of its 96% similarity, it must be able to identify H7N9. IL-17 and IP-10 can be used to the treatment of ALI caused by corresponding pathogens accordingly. study on new mechanisms of coV replication and new drug target Keynote speaker: deyin Guo Dean, School of Basic Medicine. ous transcription reveals that discontinuous transcription occurs in the synthesis stage of negative-strand. we have established high-throughput drug screening system based on the yeast targeting SARS-CoV nsp14. the polypeptide inhibitor is designed to inhibit the activity of the 2'-O-MTase. a highly potent and safe SARS submit vaccine based on the receptor-binding domain in the spike protein. the spike protein of SARS CoV, a type I transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, is responsible for virus binding and fusion. it contains some predominant immune components inducing antibodies that do not neutralize. study on the composition of bacteria that lead to secondary infection is lagging behind to some extent. we have recruited pneumonia patients with and without pH1N1 infection in Guangzhou and characterized their oropharyngeal microbiota by the high-throughput sequencing method. siRNAI inhibitors for fighting emerging respiratory viral infections will be briefly introduced. one of the most challenging concerns for anti-influenza drugs is development of drug-resistant strains. we selected potent siRNA duplexes targeting conserved regions of influenza A viruses. the ORF3a-like protein of human CoV functions as a viroporin that regulates virus release. a locus located between the spike and envelope gene is conserved in all human CoV. previous studies have shown that this locus accessory protein 3a (ORF-3a like protein) from SARS-CoV forms ion channels. state key laboratory of Respiratory Disease first confirmed the pathogen of SARS in 2003. in 2006, the year of avian influenza, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease presided over the establishment of Guangzhou Cooperation Center for the Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza. in 2006, the year of avian influenza, state Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease quickly developed the drugs, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir. state key laboratory of Respiratory Disease has made the influenza vaccine of H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) PR8, and Replication-deficient adenovirus vector Ad5-H7N7. the anti-HA7 serum has already been produced from immunized mice. state key laboratory of Respiratory Disease developed the drugs, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir. if there are no convalescents, we can screen and manufacture the monoclonal neutralizing antibody from macaque by B-cell clone, high-throughput sequencing, and phage display. state key laboratory of Respiratory Disease has made the influenza vaccine of H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) PR8, and that of H7N9. the anti-HA7 serum has already been produced from immunized mice. because of its 96% similarity, it must be able to identify H7N9. monoclonal antibodies IL-17 and IP-10 can be applied to the treatment of H1N1 virus in 2009. the emerging infectious diseases (e.g., SARS-CoV, H5N1, H1N1) infect people\u2019s respiratory system and then lead to Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. oquine, monoclonal antibodies IL-17 and IP-10 can be used to the treatment of ALI caused by corresponding pathogens accordingly. study on new mechanisms of coV replication and new drug target Keynote speaker: deyin Guo Dean, School of Basic Medicine, Wuhan University. ical subgenomic RNAs by discontinuous transcription occur in the synthesis stage of negative-strand. we have established high-throughput drug screening system based on the yeast targeting SARS-CoV nsp14 (RNA exonuclease and the methyl modified enzyme) the polypeptide inhibitor is designed to inhibit the activity of the 2'-O-MTase. SARS-CoV encodes a special protein (nsp14) which has the activities of both RNA3'-5'exonuclease enzyme and N7-MTase. this protein activates nsp16 to exercise the function of 2'-O-MTase. Influenza A virus entry and fusion are mediated by interaction between its envelop protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the host cell surface sialic acids (SA) its release is mediated by the viral surface envelop protein NA. the HA and NA of the 2009-pandemic H1N1 influenza virus encodes distinct HA (H17) and NA (NA-like N10). the spike protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for virus binding and fusion. it contains some predominant immune components inducing antibodies that do not neutralize, but rather may enhance virus infection. some of these epitopes may even induce harmful immune or inflammatory responses. the spike (S) protein of SARS CoV is responsible for virus binding and fusion. it contains some predominant immune components inducing antibodies that do not neutralize. some of these epitopes may even induce harmful immune or inflammatory responses. potential respiratory pathogens by pH1 N1 viral infection revealed by next generation sequencing. TSUI Kwok Wing, Stephen Professor, School of Biomedical Science. study on the composition of bacteria that lead to secondary infection is lagging behind. study on the composition of bacteria that lead to secondary infection is lagging behind to some extent. we recruited pneumonia patients with and without pH1N1 infection in Guangzhou and characterized their oropharyngeal microbiota. siRNAI inhibitors for fighting emerging respiratory viral infections. circulating strains were uniformly resistant to Oseltamivir or Adamantanes. we selected potent siRNA duplexes targeting conserved regions of influenza A viruses. we are currently evaluating these siRNAs with polymer-based nanoparticles for broader spectrum anti-influenza activity in animal models. one of the most challenging concerns for anti-influenza drugs such as NA inhibitors is development of drug-resistant strains. a locus located between the spike and envelope gene is conserved in all human CoV. previously, we have shown that this locus accessory protein 3a (ORF-3a like protein) from SARS-CoV forms ion channels and regulates virus release. HCoV-229E ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast. the protein expression was suppressed by siRNA in the infected cells. reassortment between migratory birds and poultry occurred in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. genetic sequence (e.g., H9N2, H11N9) has something in common with that of poultry. the genetic sequence (e.g., H9N2, H11N9) has something in common with that of poultry. there are no evidences for human-to-human transmission. there is no evidence to prove the impossibility of human-to-human transmission. the most conservative yet most effective approach is to isolate infected people once the interpersonal transmission occurs. the infectious source of H5N1 has been confirmed to be poultry. it is unsure whether that of H7N9 is chicken. it could be waterfowls, migratory birds and pigeons. if an unexplained and highly infectious disease is detected, the best way is to announce it to the whole province immediately and pay attention to isolation. if an unexplained virus is detected, the best way is to announce it to the whole province immediately and pay attention to isolation. the avian influenza virus spreads quickly and induces infection once migratory birds or poultry are infected. urban areas like Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces are identified as the high risk areas of H7N9. genetic mutation, conversion or reassortment can occur anywhere. the H7N9 with genetic reassortment is characteristically low pathogenic in poultry (i.e., no or slight symptoms), unlike H5N1. if we detect low pathogenic H7N9, we cannot kill poultry throughout the whole province or China. there is no evidence to prove the impossibility of human-to-human transmission. there is no evidence to prove the impossibility of human-to-human transmission. the most conservative yet most effective approach is to isolate infected people once the interpersonal transmission occurs. the infectious source of H5N1 has been confirmed to be poultry. but it is unsure whether that of H7N9 is chicken. a high percentage of confirmed victims have contact history with poultry. the gene of H7N9 is mainly from poultry. if an unexplained and highly infectious disease is detected, the best way is to announce it to the whole province immediately and pay attention to isolation. if an unexplained and highly infectious disease is detected, the best way is to announce it to the whole province immediately and pay attention to isolation."}
