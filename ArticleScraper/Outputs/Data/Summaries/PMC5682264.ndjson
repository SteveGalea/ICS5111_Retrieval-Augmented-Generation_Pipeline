{"summary": "the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been described as a highly contagious viral disease in several avian species. the disease is characterized by high morbidity and mortality and could be potentially contracted by humans and other warm-blooded animals. this is caused by the pathogenic subtypes H5 and H7 but with the circulating H5N1and H7N9 is causing major problems across the globe. 12 african countries (Figure-1) have been infected by this deadliest subtype. the first wave of HPAI H5N1 outbreak started in 2006, through 2007and ended in 2008. however, in 2008 no new outbreak was recorded in any other African countries. in west africa, outbreaks and reinfections were confirmed in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. in the past, there were only single outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 between 2006 and 2016, which was reported in 2006. the risk of introduction of HPAI was estimated as low for Benin and Togo and negligible for Cameroon, Senegal, and Guinea. the virus has been endemic since December 2014. it has been circulated non-stop in poultry since 2006 and 2016. the virus has evolved into multiple genetic lineages that differ antigenically. researchers have reiterated several times that there are fewer domestic waterfowls in Africa than in Asia. but it remains unclear whether the available few waterfowls can perpetuate the virus through the warm season. it is also clearly unknown whether HPA1 H5N1 is being maintained in africa local birds or periodically reintroduced. genetic reassortment can produce new influenza A viruses, such as in the case of the recent pandemic influenza A H5N1, H5N2 and H5N9 outbreaks experienced in France [30,43], H5N1 with different sublineages in Egypt [27,44], and the many HPAI subtypes recorded in Asia after the first outbreak of HPAI in 1996. emergence of HPAI H5N8 subtype outbreak in 2014 from Eastern China and South Korea [47,48] was H9N2 may not be classified as HPAI, but it is endemic in Egypt. the most important meeting points for all birds kept by people are LBMs. LBMs have been implicated in a number of avian influenza (AI) outbreaks. five factors (three protective and two risk factors) were compromised and could predispose to HPAI H5N1 outbreak significantly. the display and trade of wild animals and birds in LBMs have been pointed out as another risk factor. pattern of spread of this infection has been associated with uncontrolled movement of poultry and poultry products. small poultry population with poor biosecurity measures. poor or lack of disease control strategies result in high levels of mortality due to infectious diseases. increasing standards of cleanliness as well as containment when applied reduces or prevent the risk of introducing disease into a flock. if there is an outbreak of HPAI, there are two primary strategies to control and possibly prevent further spread of the infection. depopulation was practiced one time or the other in 11 out of 12 african countries that have experienced HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. recombinant Turkey Herpes virus and attenuated H5N1vaccines were used to stimulate the production of high antibody titer which protected Mulard ducks against HPAI H5N1. poor techniques and incorrect administration of the HPAI H5N1 vaccinations and a mismatch between the antigens in the vaccine and the antigens circulating in the wild are other factors which can lead to a limited impact as a disease control measure. a period of time (pasteurization and cooking) can inactivate the HPAIV in infected poultry meat and egg. the virus can survive indefinitely if poultry product is well frozen. this can occur through informal poultry trades and, live and migratory bird movement. illegal trades of poultry, poultry products, and porous borders are factors that predispose to varying levels of risk of transmission of HPAI H5N1. this occurs from infected regions to vulnerable and uninfected neighboring central African countries. the majority of human cases of AI (H5N1) infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. transmission of the virus can result from movement of contaminated fomites including by people, on contaminated clothing, equipment, and vehicles. there is no known cure for HPAI and immunization remains a complex and cumbersome endeavor. the case fatality rate in humans due to HPAI H5N1 infection is high compared with other countries. the cases, death and CFR continue to increase unabated since the first outbreak in 2006. this calls for lasting public health strategies to combat the scourge. every african nation with or without HPAI H5N1 outbreak must realistically assess its status (especially its borders, live bird markets, and periurban populations) the conduct of regular active surveillance and being transparent with HPAI H5N1outbreak data is very important. a control strategy based on culling of birds may not be sufficient to avoid spread of HPAI H5N1. risk assessments and identification of risk factors predisposing to outbreaks are necessary for modeling and prediction of time and likelihood of locations of future outbreaks. the time has come to set up appropriate measures and put machines in motion to combat and possibly subdue influenza pandemics. the first wave of HPAI H5N1 outbreak started in the year 2006. 12 african countries have been infected by this deadliest subtype. the first wave of HPAI H5N1 outbreak started in 2006. affecting 8 african countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan) in 2006 and 3 countries (Benin, Ghana, and Togo) in 2007. in 2008 no new outbreak was recorded in any other African countries. however, the infection sustained and continued in Benin. a conducted survey revealed that the risk of introduction of HPAI H5N1 was estimated as low for Benin and Togo. Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Niger were pinpointed as the most likely routes of viral incursion. most of the countries mentioned to have negligible to low-risk experienced these outbreaks on a massive scale. the development of large-scale commercial farms will enhance the potential for epidemic transmission and evolution of influenza viruses. high stocking densities in large commercial farms will facilitate rapid and efficient transmission of highly virulent viruses such as H5N1 that might otherwise kill their hosts before being transmitted [31,32]. genetic reassortment can produce new influenza A viruses, such as in the case of the recent pandemic influenza A H5N1, H5N2 and H5N9 outbreaks in france. genetic reassortment can produce new influenza A viruses, such as in the case of the recent pandemic influenza A H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9 outbreaks experienced in france. the emergence of HPAI H5N8 subtype outbreak in 2014 from eastern China and south Korea was confirmed to have evolved from H5N1 [46,49,50]. the emergence of HPAI H5N8 subtype in 2014 from eastern China and south Korea was confirmed to have evolved from H5N1 [46,49,50]. the most important meeting points for all birds kept by people are LBMs. LBMs play a key role in the dynamics of influenza virus transmission and evolution. many of the outbreaks recorded in Nigeria and Egypt are market-based or have links with the LBMs. patterns of spread of this infection have been associated with uncontrolled movement of poultry and poultry products, lack of effective contingency plans to guide the containment, geographical, and ecological factors. identifying risk factors associated with biosecurity compliance level in LBMs, Nigeria, and Egypt. 81 outbreaks of HPAI were recorded mainly in extensively reared duck farms, initially harboring LPAI viruses. this eventually generated three HPAI subtypes (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9). this eventually spread to commercial layer farms, killing millions of chickens and ducks. s. Egypt combined both depopulation and vaccination. it is the only additional measure that can be taken to try to reduce disease spread. a vaccination policy on the dynamics of infection is primarily aimed at reducing the susceptibility to infection. live AI vaccines prepared using natural avirulent or attenuated strains are associated with an inherent risk for generating new reassortant influenza viruses. this can lead to the evolution of viruses with an increased virulence with unpredictable characteristics. reassortants could arise when a host bird is simultaneously infected with both live AI vaccine and another influenza virus. organic matter is present aldehydes, -propiolactone, and binary ethylenimine should be used for inactivation. HPAIV are inactivated by disinfectants, clean surfaces with no organic matter, sodium hypochlorite (5.25%) will be enough, sodium hydroxide (2%), acidified ionophores, chlorine dioxide, or strong oxidizing agents. the likelihood of outbreaks occurring is high. the virus is able to change into a highly pathogenic variant with very high fatality rate. this has given rise to the fear that the virus might acquire capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission if the viruses gain opportunities to infect and evolve in humans. the cumulative number of confirmed human cases for AI H5N1 across the globe per year from 2006 to 2015 is as shown in Table-3. the cumulative number of confirmed human cases and deaths for avian influenza (H5N1) across the globe per year from 2006 to 2015 is as shown in Table-3.
