{"summary": "respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are increasingly recognized to be more prevalent in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) than previously considered. so far, RVIs have frequently been undiagnosed or have been identified only late in the course of an infectious episode because of their subtle clinical presentation. current knowledge of and literature on early-life RVI in the NICU is discussed on the basis of human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. only original research articles based on modern molecular biology techniques and published in English as well as reporting hospital-acquired RVIs were included. details on the studies investigating the occurrence of RVIs in the NICU are given in Table 1. studies investigating the occurrence of RVIs in the NICU including detected viruses. childrenzun et al., 2014, Germany All infants evaluated for LOS 19 month 6/60 (10%) Picornavirus (n = 5), RSV (n = 1) Ronchi et al., 2014, USA All infants evaluated for LOS 12 month 8/100 (8%) Entero-/rhinoviruses (n = 2), HRV (n = 2), coroncavirus (n = 2), parainfluenza viruses (n = 2) Bennett et al. the majority of patients hospitalized in a NICU have an immature and inexperienced immune system. their innate cytokine response against viruses can be inadequate or overwhelming. the long-term impact of early-life RVIs is lesser explopored. influenza is an RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. type A is responsible for most clinical infection in humans. type B accounts only for 11% of human infections and type C causes only mild illness. method is annual vaccination against influenza of parents, other caregivers and health care workers. infected NICU staff may be the source of nosocomial outbreaks. infected staff may be the source of nosocomial outbreaks. a cranial MRI did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient fully recovered from the influenza infection. a cranial MRI did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient fully recovered from the influenza infection. oseltamivir treatment of affected infants, oseltamivir prophylaxis in all other infants in the NICU, cohorting Index case identified Not specified Next to these outbreak descriptions there are some cases on influenza infections in infants hospitalized in the NICU. this is the only infant reported to have died in the NICU due to influenza A infection. all other reported infants recovered fully from the infection. this is in contrast to reports in other healthcare settings and older patients. filtration and tubular secretion processes are diminished in neonates and young adults. oseltamivir has been shown to reduce the duration of illness in previously healthy children by 26%. human rhinovirus (HRV) is among the most frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants hospitalized in the NICU. more than 150 different HRV genotypes are known so far. oseltamivir must be started within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. five reports on HRV outbreaks in hospitalized NICU patients have been identified. HRV species C was detected as causative agent in three of these reports. HRV affected both term and preterm infants. gioma, neuromuscular impairment owing to severe perinatal asphyxia and suspected metabolic disorder correlated with a more severe disease course. study date NICU Pathogen Affected infants Symptoms Median age at symptoms onset (range) Infection control measures Source of the outbreak Marcone et al., 2018, Argentina Winter 2014 Level III Four different rhinovirus genotypes (C43, C1, C6, and A63-like) 2 extremely preterm, 3 very preterm, 1 late 4 infants developed recurrent respiratory tract infections in the first year of life. a further challenge of HRV is that virus shedding has been reported to occur to 44 days in otherwise healthy preterm infants. most at risk are infants aged 6 months, preterm infants born prior to 35 weeks PMA. some studies reported more severe disease courses in RSV subtype A infections compared to subytpe B. the virus replicates in the nasal or ocular mucosal epithelium. there is a limited number of reports in the literature on nosocomially acquired RSV infections among both term and preterm infants in the NICU. four NICU outbreaks of RSV were reported using RT-PCR technology for virus detection. however, individual infections as early as on day 10 of life were reported. both patients were male and born at 28 and 32 weeks PMA respectively. the first child suffered from a dual infection with RSV A and B while the second was infected with RSV B (Visser et al., 2008). palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is usually administered prior to hospital discharge to be protective against community-acquired RSV infection. if administered correctly, palivizumab has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing the number of RSV-related hospitalization in randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials. s in the NICU is still limited (Ronchi et al., 2014; Cerone et al., 2017; Kidszun et al., 2017). an observational study from the Netherlands found an overall incidence of RVIs in the NICU of around 1% (Verboon-Maciolek et al., 2005). 3 infants were co-infected with more than one virus RSV (n = 14), HRV (n = 11), others (n = 7) Kidszun et al., 2017, Germany All infants evaluated for LOS 43 month 6/137 (6.8%) Picornavirus (n = 4), RSV (n = 2) Caserta et al., 2017, USA All infants in the NICU 36 weeks PMA 2 month 4/618 (0.6%), 50% asymptom early-life RVIs have been reported to be associated with increased length of hospital stay, severe disease, otherwise avoidable antimicrobial exposure, and nosocomial outbreaks in the NICU. 51% of preterm infants with a RVI needed escalation of respiratory support during the episode with more respiratory pressure support and twice as many required home oxygen. influenza virus infections have long been thought to be uncommon in neonates due to the presence of maternal antibodies. however, there is an increasing number of reports on influenza infections in neonates and descriptions of influenza spread within neonatal units. influenza type A is responsible for most clinical infection in humans. type B accounts only for 11% of human infections and type C causes only mild illness. the incubation period of influenza ranges from 1 to 5 days. all these outbreaks occurred during the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic. the affected infants presented mainly with respiratory symptoms including desaturation, tachypnea, increased secretions, apnea and need for mechanical ventilation. bradycardia, pyrexia, and rales were observed. Oseltamivir treatment of affected infants, cohorting, admission stop for 3 days, enhanced surveillance for 2 weeks Unknown 40% Tsagris et al., 2012, Greece February 2011 Level III Influenza A/H1N1/2009 3 preterm infants born at 24, 28, and 35 weeks PMA Apnoea, pyrexia, rhinits 67 (47\u201384) Oseltamivir treatment of affected infants, oseltami a preterm infant of 32 weeks PMA developed respiratory failure on day of life 50 due to influenza A/H1N1. the infant was diagnosed with influenza A/H1N1 on day of life 10 and oseltamivir was started in therapeutic dosage. the infant died on day of life 16 due to refractory shock and multiorgan dysfunction. oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor effective against both influenza A and B. it is converted to its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate by hepatic esterases and then renally eliminated through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion processes. the recommendation for dosage was initially age-dependent and was corrected to a weight-based dosing approach. results from this study suggest a therapeutic oseltamivir dose of 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. both treatment and prophylaxis with oseltamivir must be started within 48 h of the onset of symptoms or of exposure to be effective. HRV is classified into 3 species, A, B and C, within the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family. more than 150 different HRV genotypes are known so far. in the report of van Piggelen et al. from the Netherlands, all infants needed mechanical ventilation during the infectious episode. severe respiratory failure due to HRV infection does not seem to be uncommon (reid et al., 2011; Steiner et al., 2012; Reese et al., 2016; Marcone et al., 2018) at 25 weeks PMA and 31 weeks PMA Symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, need for oxygen supplementation 44 days (16\u201373) Not specified Unknown Steiner et al., 2012, Austria 11 month in 2011 Level III HRV species C 7 preterm infants born at 25\u201329 weeks PMA Increased respiratory secretions, unstable body temperature, apnea, increase in supplemental oxygen therapy 75 (14\u2013282) RSV is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae family. it is classified in the genus orthopneumovirus. it causes seasonal outbreaks worldwide. homaira et al. examined clothing of health care workers and visitors as potential source of RSV infection in the NICU and detected RSV-RNA only at a low viral load on clothing of health care workers. newly obtained secretions from infected infants survive on clothing of health care workers for 40 min. so carriage on clothing may contribute to nosocomial infections in the NICU. many infants needed mechanical ventilation in the course of the infection. one case was reported to require extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Halasa et al., 2005). only 4 of 1,002 samples tested positive for RSV. on 22 days (31\u201359 days) Palivizumab given to all NICU patients not infected with RSV, respiratory and contact precautions, no transfer of infants between the rooms, admissions limited to unforeseen emergencies, increased frequency of cleaning, cohorting of affected infants Index case identified Only reports using PCR-based diagnostic techniques were included. despite these anecdotal reports, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab is currently not recommended for the prevention of health care-associated RSV infections. of all infection control methods, adequate hand washing/hand disinfection, rapid screening for infection and cohorting of infected patients are most effective to prevent RSV transmission."}{"summary": "respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are increasingly recognized to be more prevalent in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) than previously considered. so far, RVIs have frequently been undiagnosed or have been identified only late in the course of an infectious episode because of their subtle clinical presentation. current knowledge of and literature on early-life RVI in the NICU is discussed on the basis of human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. only original research articles based on modern molecular biology techniques and published in English as well as reporting hospital-acquired RVIs were included. details on the studies investigating the occurrence of RVIs in the NICU are given in Table 1. studies investigating the occurrence of RVIs in the NICU including detected viruses. childrenzun et al., 2014, Germany All infants evaluated for LOS 19 month 6/60 (10%) Picornavirus (n = 5), RSV (n = 1) Ronchi et al., 2014, USA All infants evaluated for LOS 12 month 8/100 (8%) Entero-/rhinoviruses (n = 2), HRV (n = 2), coroncavirus (n = 2), parainfluenza viruses (n = 2) Bennett et al. the majority of patients hospitalized in a NICU have an immature and inexperienced immune system. their innate cytokine response against viruses can be inadequate or overwhelming. the long-term impact of early-life RVIs is lesser explopored. influenza is an RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. type A is responsible for most clinical infection in humans. type B accounts only for 11% of human infections and type C causes only mild illness. method is annual vaccination against influenza of parents, other caregivers and health care workers. infected NICU staff may be the source of nosocomial outbreaks. infected staff may be the source of nosocomial outbreaks. a cranial MRI did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient fully recovered from the influenza infection. a cranial MRI did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient fully recovered from the influenza infection. oseltamivir treatment of affected infants, oseltamivir prophylaxis in all other infants in the NICU, cohorting Index case identified Not specified Next to these outbreak descriptions there are some cases on influenza infections in infants hospitalized in the NICU. this is the only infant reported to have died in the NICU due to influenza A infection. all other reported infants recovered fully from the infection. this is in contrast to reports in other healthcare settings and older patients. filtration and tubular secretion processes are diminished in neonates and young adults. oseltamivir has been shown to reduce the duration of illness in previously healthy children by 26%. human rhinovirus (HRV) is among the most frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants hospitalized in the NICU. more than 150 different HRV genotypes are known so far. oseltamivir must be started within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. five reports on HRV outbreaks in hospitalized NICU patients have been identified.
