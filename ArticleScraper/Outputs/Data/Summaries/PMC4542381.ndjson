{"summary": "double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a viral product essential in the induction of innate immunity. it leads to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) (1, 2) and activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. dsRNA is a viral product essential in the induction of innate immunity. recognition of dsRNA is presumed to require a length equal to or greater than 30 nucleotides. early biochemical studies of viral replication suggested that most viruses produce dsRNAs (12\u201315) however, in 2006, Weber et al. (16) reported that dsRNA could be detected by immunofluorescence antibody staining in double-stranded DNA and positive-strand RNA virus infections but not in negative-strand RNA virus infections. antibodies to dsRNA may also be used to enrich for viral sequences in cDNA library construction and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for viral discovery. cells of the immature myelomonocytic cell line M1 were grown in DMEM. stock of enterovirus 71 (EV71), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; A59), IAV (H3N2, Udorn), MeV (Chicago), LCMV (Armstrong) and NyaV were gifts from Alan Nix (CDC, Atlanta, GA), Tom Gallagher (Loyola School of Medicine, Chicago, IL), Bob Lamb (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL), Robert Fujinami (University of Utah School of Medicine, antibodies to dsRNA used were mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) J2 (Scion, Budapest, Hungary), mouse monoclonal antibody 9D5 (ascitic fluid; David Schnurr, California State Department of Health, Richmond, CA) and rabbit polyclonal antibody 170A (David Stollar, Rutgers, New Brunswick, NJ) rabbit anti-caspase-3 and rabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (anti-PARP) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; 1:500) and anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:500) were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2,000) the coverslips were inverted onto gel mount (Biomedia, Foster City, CA) on microscope slides. a 47-mer RNA duplex of beAn virus nucleotides (5\u2032-GUCUAAGGCCGCUCGGAAUAUGACAGGGUUUUUU-3\u2032; Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL) were used in blotting. membranes were blotted with a 1:6,000 dilution of secondary anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody in TBS at 24\u00b0C for 1 h. after washing in TBST three times for 10 min each time, the membranes were blotted with SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 to cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 7.5% tryptose phosphate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 g of streptomycin/ml at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the origin and passage history of the TMEV stock have been reported previously. 71 (EV71), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; A59), IAV (H3N2, Udorn), MeV (Chicago), LCMV (Armstrong), and NyaV were gifts from Alan Nix (CDC, Atlanta, GA), Tom Gallagher (Loyola School of Medicine, Chicago, IL), Bob Lamb (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL), Mark Burgoon (University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, CO), antibodies to dsRNA used were mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) J2 (Scion, Budapest, Hungary), mouse monoclonal antibody 9D5 (ascitic fluid; David Schnurr, California State Department of Health, Richmond, CA) rabbit polyclonal antibody 170A (David Stollar, Rutgers, New Brunswick, NJ) signaling technology (Beverly, MA), goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; 1:500) and anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:500) were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2,000) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (1:2,000) were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and goat anti- three times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min each time, twice with PBS for 5 min each time, and once with distilled H2O for 1 min each time. a 47-mer RNA duplex of beAn virus nucleotides (5\u2032-GUCUAAGGCCGCUCGGAAUGACAGGGUUUUU-3\u2032; Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL) were used in Northwestern blotting. the membranes were blotted with superSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 24\u00b0C for 1 to 2 min, exposed, and developed with HyBlot CL autoradiography film (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ) the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.02% Tween 20. details of the specificity of rabbit polyclonal antibody 170A and the J2 mouse MAb to dsRNA were reported previously (13, 21), using scanning force microscopy. the MAb 9D5 turned out instead to have reactivity to dsRNA. the antibody appears to recognize perfect RNA duplexes ranging in size from 100 bp to 16 kbp but not ssRNA. the J2 MAb provided identical, albeit weaker staining than MAb 9D5 in infected cells. the gel contained large molecular size ssRNA markers and a 47-mer RNA duplex. agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide shows barely detectable TMEV RF RNA. dsRNA staining was abrogated when infected monolayers were incubated with RNase III. TMEV antigens stained with polyclonal rabbit antisera colocalized with dsRNA, although on different molecules. similar punctate dsRNA and virus antigen staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of EV71-infected Vero B6 cells (MOI = 5) at 6 h p.i. and MHV-infected astrocytoma-derived DBT cells (MOI = 5) at 6 h p. cells stained with specific antiviral antibodies (C, F, I) fields in center (B, E, H) and right (C, F, I) panels are identical. TMEV-infected cells showed strong punctate cytoplasmic staining (green) the results of incubations of RNases with EV71 and MHV are the same as those for incubations of RNases with TMEV. all insets have the same magnification as the full panels. weaker dsRNA immunofluorescence was observed in negative-strand RNA virus infections. dsRNA was not detected by immunofluorescence staining of IAV and La Crosse virus infections. dsRNA staining in cells with negative-strand RNA virus infections was less intense. the slightly more prominent staining may be due to an increased amount of cytoplasm of the large giant cell shown. however, single MeV-infected cells had a similar intensity of staining. dsRNA reactivity was present exclusively in the nucleus of NyaV-infected cells. anti-dsRNA reactivity was present exclusively in the nucleus of NyaV-infected cells. dsRNA was not detected at 3, 4, 8, and 16 h p.i. these results are consistent with the nuclear replication of NyaV. dsRNA-positive foci of various sizes in the nucleus are shown in Fig. 3C, G, and K. mouse antiserum to NyaV revealed diffuse cytoplasmic reactivity. cytoplasmic dsRNA staining was also observed in LCMV-infected Vero B6 cells (MOI = 0.01) at 7 days p.i., an expected result, as was staining for the LCMV nucleoprotein, but the nucleoprotein signal colocalized with dsRNA in only some cells. however, there were many more small dots of staining in the nucleus, and they varied more in size. rare nuclei showed discrete areas of NS1 staining in the nucleus. we were unable to detect dsRNA in a HepG2 cell clone persistently infected with HBV and expressing HBV core protein. these results indicate that immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to dsRNA probably detects most, but not all, animal virus infections. monolayers showed cytoplasmic staining with a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal antibody to MVM NS1/2 (no DAPI counterstaining) the images in panels F and G were not from the same field. cellular stress resulting in apoptosis did not induce detectable levels of dsRNA staining in uninfected cells. induction of apoptosis in uninfected M1-D, BHK-21, Vero B6, and MDCK cell monolayers with these reagents did not reveal dsRNA staining. thus, cellular stress resulting in apoptosis did not induce dsRNA species to levels detectable by immunofluorescence antibody staining. dsRNA RFs of influenza virus genomic segments were also bound by 9D5. the 9D5 antibody detected as little as 50 ng of TMEV dsRNA. it showed positive staining of TMEV-infected M1-D cells at a dilution to 1:10,000, whereas the dilution of J2 required for detection of TMEV dsRNA and positive staining was 1:500. the gel contained large molecular size ssRNA markers, a 47-mer RNA duplex, small-molecular-size (100- to 1,000-bp) poly(IC) and large-molecular-size (1 to 8 kbp) poly(IC) in the four lanes from left to right. the gel contained large molecular size ssRNA markers, a 47-mer RNA duplex, small-molecular-size (100- to 1,000-b lane 2 from the panel on the left showing the reactivity of IAV genome RF segments. a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide showed barely detectable TMEV RF RNA. a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide showed barely detectable TMEV RF RNA. clonal rabbit antisera colocalized with dsRNA, although on different molecules. similar punctate dsRNA and virus antigen staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of EV71-infected Vero B6 cells (MOI = 5) at 6 h p.i. and MHV-infected astrocytoma-derived DBT cells. TMEV-infected cells stained with 1:3,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to TMEV virions showing cytoplasmic staining (red) strong punctate cytoplasmic staining (green) was shown in uninfected cells (D) but not in infected cells (E) fluorescence was observed in negative-strand RNA virus infections. dsRNA was not detected by immunofluorescence staining of IAV and La Crosse virus infections. other investigators reported that dsRNA was absent or dsRNA was expressed at much lower concentrations in wild-type Sendai virus and MeV infections. uninfected (A, E, I, M) and infected (B, F, J, N) cell monolayers were stained with a 1:2,000 dilution of MAb 9D5 or polyclonal antibody 170A. the other infected monolayers were stained with the specific antiviral antibodies (C, G, K, O) anti-dsRNA reactivity was present exclusively in the nucleus of NyaV-infected cells. incubation of IAV-infected cells with proteinase K prior to staining revealed spheroidal dots of immunoreactive dsRNA in the nucleus. mouse antiserum to NyaV revealed diffuse cytoplasmic reactivity. these results indicate that in negative-strand RNA virus infections, dsRNA is formed in amounts sufficient for detection by immunofluorescence analysis. photomicrographs of other negative-strand RNA viruses are not shown. dsRNA staining was also observed in LCMV-infected vero B6 cells (MOI = 0.01) at 7 days p.i., an expected result, as was staining for the LCMV nucleoprotein, but the nucleoprotein signal colocalized with dsRNA in only some cells. however, there were many more small dots of staining in the nucleus, and they varied more in size. immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to dsRNA probably detects most, but not all, animal virus infections. uninfected (A, E) and infected (B, F) cell monolayers were stained with a 1:2,000 dilution of MAb 9D5 to dsRNA. infected monolayers were stained with the specific antiviral antibodies (C, G) cellular stress resulting in apoptosis did not induce detectable levels of dsRNA staining in uninfected cells. cellular stress resulting in apoptosis did not induce dsRNA staining. however, cellular stress resulting in apoptosis did not induce. dsRNA species are produced in sufficient amounts in most animal virus infections to be readily detected by immunofluorescence antibody staining. lack of induction of dsRNA reactivity with CXH and CXH plus TNF-, which results in apoptosis, in uninfected macrophages. negative-strand RNA viruses from four different virus families generated dsRNAs of double-stranded character detectable by routine immunofluorescence antibody staining. the intensity of staining tended to be weaker in VSV-, IAV-, and MeV-infected cells than in positive-strand RNA virus-infected cells. however, the optimum dose and the timing p.i. of dsRNA formation by the different viruses were not examined in detail, nor virusa Nature of genome Reference(s) Adenoviridae (adenovirus) dsDNA 16, 39 Herpesviridae HSV-1 dsDNA 16 CMV dsDNA 39 Poxviridae, vaccinia virus dsDNA 16 Reoviridae Reovirus dsRNA 16 Rotavirus dsRNA 39 Togaviridae Rubella virus ssRNA, positive strand 40, 41 Sindbis virus ss dsRNA was found in the cytoplasm, frequently perinuclear in location, and was found in areas where the viroplasm is found. in NyaV- and MVM-infected cells that replicate in the nucleus, dsRNA was exclusively nuclear. we are unaware of prior reports of dsRNA staining in the nucleus for any virus infection. the dsRNA target in the cytoplasm remains a mystery. it is also RF RNA exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. the issue of dsRNA as a cellular product upregulated during viral infections was raised in a detailed study of the activation of PKR in meV infection. cellular stress from apoptosis induced by incubation of uninfected cell monolayers with CHX alone or both CHX and TNF- did not result in observable intracellular dsRNA reactivity. dsRNA antibodies may have a place in viral discovery using next-generation sequencing (NGS)"}
