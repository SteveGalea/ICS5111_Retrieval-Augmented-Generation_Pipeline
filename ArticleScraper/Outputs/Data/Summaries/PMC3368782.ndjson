{"summary": "the identity of brain-infiltrating leukocytes was determined using microscopy and flow cytometry at several acute time points following intracranial infection of mice with the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. results Inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils were found in the brain at 12 h after infection. depletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils with the Gr1 antibody resulted in hippocampal neuroprotection and preservation of cognitive function. inflammatory monocytes are the key effector of brain injury during acute picornavirus infection of the brain. neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the brain within 12 h of infection, indicating that infiltration of such innate effectors is a hyperacute response. the absence of an inflammatory monocyte response but not the absence of a neutrophil response resulted in neuroprotection and cognitive preservation. sham-infected mice received intracranial injection of 10 L virus-free RPMI. mice aged 4 to 6 weeks were acclimatized for at least 1 week prior to use. mice were group housed in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine research vivarium. free floating sections were blocked in PBS plus 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h. cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in block, washed, incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS, washed, and mounted on gelatin-subbed slides. stained cells were washed three times in flow cytometry buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde prior to flow cytometric analysis on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). files were offline using FlowJo 7.5 (Windows version; Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA) CD45 was detected with clone 30-F11 (BD Biosciences no. 557235); CD11b was detected with clone M mice aged 4 to 6 weeks received intracranial injection of 10 L virus-free RPMI. Upon arrival, mice were acclimatized for at least 1 week prior to use. mice were group housed in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine research vivarium. free floating sections were blocked in PBS plus 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h. cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in block, washed, incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS, and mounted on gelatin-subbed slides. CD45 was detected with clone 30-F11 (BD Biosciences no. 557235) CD11b was detected with clone M1/70 (BD Biosciences no. 553312). F4/80 was detected with clone BM8 (eBiosciences no. 53-4801-82). Ly6C/G was detected with clone 1A8 (BD Biosciences no. 551467) inflammation was most concentrated in the hippocampal region (Figure 1B), with high density in the corpus callosum and alveus and at the hippocampal fissure (Figure 1B, D). infiltrating cells were also observed within the pyramidal neuron layer of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) in the hippocampus (Figure 1D, I). in sham-infected mice, despite receiving a needle stick through the calvarium, no evidence higher magnification confirms the presence of infiltrate throughout the corpus callosum and alveus (H), within the CA1 pyramidal neuron cell layer (I) and within the perivascular space along the hippocampal fissure (J) in virus-infected mice but not in sham-infected mice (E-G) the population of CD45hi cells could be distinguished by surface F4/80 expression. some F4/80+ cells positive for Gr1 but no F4/80+ cells positive for 1A8. the 1A8 antigen is explicitly Ly6G and is only observed on neutrophils and granulocytes. TMEV-infected mice were killed at 18 h post infection (hpi) brain was collected fresh and processed for the isolation of brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) no CD45hi cells were observed in sham-infected mice (A) Flow cytometric scatter characteristics of brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) from acutely infected mice were gated by forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) profiles. results are representative of three mice. the availability of the 1A8 marker, which only recognizes Ly6G, now allows for better resolution of these populations [15,19] we also examined the Ly6 series in blood at 18 hpi and compared the profile to BILs from the same animal (Figure 4). /macrophages were consistently negative for all Ly6 antigens. Flow cytometric analysis of PBLs (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O) and BILs (B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P) collected from the same mouse 18 h after infection with theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) revealed the presence of readily distinguishable neutrophil populations in both cell preparations. Gating into GFPhi, GFPmid, and GFPneg populations confirmed that our CD11b+++Gr1+1A8+ neutrophil population was almost exclusively GFPhi (Figure 5D, G), while our CD11b+++Gr1+1A8- inflammatory monocyte population was almost exclusively GFPmid (Figure 5E, H). the clear distinction between GFP+ and GFP- cells in the BILs population was further exploited by assessing the physical location of the robust localization of these cells to the hippocampal formation is consistent with our previously published observations that the hippocampus is the primary site of pathology following TMEV infection. this damage is not a direct result of the virus but rather a bystander phenomenon [8]. the distribution of GFP+ neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes at low magnification matches the distribution of inflammatory infiltrate observed in Figure 1. the distribution of inflammatory monocytes at low magnification matches the distribution of inflammatory infiltrate. a small population of neutrophils was present in the BILs by 12 hpi. by 18 hpi the density of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes had increased. by 24 hpi the number of neutrophils continued to increase. the granular profile of neutrophils was also clearly present by FSC and SSC at 24 hpi (J) results are representative of more than 20 mice at each timepoint. the hippocampus is a target for the rapid infiltration of CD45+CD11b+Gr1+ and CD45+CD11b+1A8+ cells. no staining for any of the markers was observed in the uninfected brain (A-E) no staining for any of the markers was observed in the uninfected brain (A-E) inflammatory monocytes injure the hippocampus We have previously hypothesized that the immune response to acute TMEV infection mediates subsequent hippocampal injury that leads to cognitive deficits [8]. inflammatory monocytes were simultaneously depleted by daily injection of purified RB6-8C5 (500 g/day; rat anti-Gr1) 11 3 neutrophils in the 18 hpi BILs and only 6.7% 0.4% of the BILs were CD45hi. the thick, multi-cell-layered NeuN staining in the CA1 layer in Figure 9K is indistinguishable from uninfected mice. the reduction in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils was highly significant versus control BILs. RB6-treated mice showed the same ability to learn in the maze as uninfected mice. uninfected mice showed the same ability to learn in the maze as uninfected mice. inflammatory monocytes are responsible for hippocampal damage and loss of cognitive function. histological analysis of hippocampal injury (G-I) and staining for neuron-specific marker NeuN (J-L) revealed that depletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils protected the hippocampus (H) and preserved the neurons in CA1 (K) whereas depletion of only neutrophils had no effect on the injury (I, L) histological analysis of the brain at 24 h post infection (hpi) revealed marked inflammation and large numbers of infiltrating cells in the infected mice. inflammation was most concentrated in the hippocampal region (Figure 1B), with high density in the corpus callosum and alveus and at the hippocampal fissure (Figure 1B, D) brain was processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. inflammatory infiltrate is present above the hippocampus and throughout the corpus callosum in the TMEV-infected mice (B, D), but not in sham-infected mice (E-G). most of the CD45hi cells in the brain-infiltrating leukocytes were CD11b positive, albeit at two different intensity levels. we routinely distinguished CD11b++ and CD11b+++ populations (Figure 2C, D) these populations could also be distinguished by levels of surface staining with the Gr1 antibody (Figure 2C) and the 1A8 antibody (Figure 2D) approximately 60% of the CD45hi cell population in the brain at 18 hpi are inflammatory monocytes. approximately 20% of the CD45hi cell population in the brain at 18 hpi are neutrophils. TMEV-infected mice were killed at 18 h post infection. ophils (CD45hi1A8+Gr1+CD11b+++F4/80-) and inflammatory monocytes (CD45hi1A8-Gr1+CD11b+++F4/80+) in individual mice revealed that about 80% of the CD45hi cells belonged to one of these populations (G) the flow plots in (A-F) are representative. three mice contained only CD45midCD11b+Gr1-1A8- microglia (resident macrophages) (D) inflammatory monocytes exhibited higher surface levels of 7/4 (Ly6B-specific) inflammatory monocytes exhibited higher surface levels of 7/4 (Ly6B-specific). brain-resident microglia/macrophages were consistently negative for all Ly6 antigens. Flow cytometric analysis of PBLs (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O) and BILs revealed the presence of readily distinguishable neutrophil populations in both cell preparations. however, inflammatory monocytes were only detected in the BILs. the CD45+CD11b+ macrophage population in the blood was negative for all Ly6 series antigens. results are representative of five mice. we further confirmed the presence of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the brain. the white matter tracts overlying the hippocampus and the vasculature-rich hippocampal fissure are primary sites for infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. this suggests that the hippocampus is the primary site of pathology following TMEV infection. this damage is not a direct result of the virus but rather a bystander phenomenon [8] TMEV-infected mice were killed by intracardiac perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde 18 h after infection. the distribution of GFP+ neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes at low magnification matches the distribution of inflammatory infiltrate observed in Figure 1. analysis of BILs at 6 hpi showed a small but inconsistent population of inflammatory monocytes. a small population of neutrophils was present in the BILs by 12 hpi. by 18 hpi the density of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes had increased. both CD11b++Gr1+ inflammatory monocytes and CD11b+++1A8+ neutrophils increased in number by 18 hpi (D-E) both of these populations increased in number by 18 hpi (G-I) inflammatory monocytes continued to increase in the infiltrate by 24 hpi (K, L), while inflammatory monocytes began to decrease at this time point (K, L) hippocampus is a target for rapid infiltration of CD45+CD11b+Gr1+ and CD45+CD11b+1A8+ cells. no staining for any of the markers was observed in the uninfected brain. 1 pyramidal neuron layer (middle of each image) and the hippocampal fissure (bottom of each image) confirms the increasing density of the CD45+ infiltrate and also confirms that the Gr1+ population peaks at 24 h (N), while the 1A8+ population continues to increase through time (J, O, T) results are representative of more than five mice at each timepoint. hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology (Figure 9G) and immunostaining for the neuronal marker NeuN represent neuronal dropout or pyknotic neurons. RB6-treated mice had only 106 34 inflammatory monocytes and 11 3 neutrophils in the 18 hpi BILs. only 6.7% 0.4% of the BILs were CD45hi. 1A8 treatment was 23.4% 1.3% (control vs 1A8: q(28,2) = 1.064, P = 0.458; RB6 vs 1A8: q(28,3) = 34.188, P 0.001) critically, the hippocampus was robustly injured in the 1A8-treated mice. absence of hippocampal injury led to the preservation of cognitive function as assessed by Morris water maze. inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils were collected at 18 hpi. RB6 treatment abrogated most of the inflammatory monocyte (B) and neutrophil response (E). inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils were counted by flow cytometry. RB6-8C5 immunodepleted mice performed as well as uninfected controls. in contrast, infected mice that were not depleted were unable to learn the maze at any point during the testing phase. inflammatory monocytes precede neutrophils into the brain. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions CLH designed all experiments, analyzed all data, and executed all of the microscopy."}
