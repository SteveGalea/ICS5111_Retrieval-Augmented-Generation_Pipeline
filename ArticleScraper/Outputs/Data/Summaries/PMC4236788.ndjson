Radius and ulna SL:AL ratios were 0.799 to 1.015 (affected) and 0.975 to 1.008 (controls) for the radii. subchondral bone cysts were present in 4 condyles. they ranged from 50 to 350 m in diameter, were lined by a thin fibrous capsule and were optically empty. one cyst was surrounded by hemosiderin-laden macrophages. 7.55 17.68 18.20 9.50 0.79-45.33 AST, U/L 258.40 251.34 194.68 162.80 242.55 471.90 139.70 187.60 51.24-316.21 Bilirubin, mol/L 1.50 1.76 1.82 1.60 1.38 1.90 1.50 1.30 0.03-4.24 Ca, mmol/L 2.54 2.54 2.54 2.47 2.38 2.59 2.52 2.49 1.78-2.96 148.75 151.66 147.90 148.42 155.50-174.00 P, mmol/L 2.08 2.34 2.31 2.01 2.38 2.43 2.35 2.16 0.47-2.43 Total protein, g/L 55.17 53.60 62.96 59.25 57.88 55.76 62.04 60.56 41.10-74.8 a From reference 11. Discussion This report is first description of idiopathic bending of the scap bended bones can be caused by growth disorders such as skeletal dysplasias. the bowing could be physiologic and self-correcting. a primary bone growth disorder is most likely. skeletal dysplasias in humans are often related to a genetic defect. a human fluorescence in situ hybridization test on blood of one affected marmoset failed to demonstrate the SHOX genetic mutation. however, it is unclear whether this assay is applicable to marmosets. skeletal dysplasias in humans are often related to a genetic defect. hypovitaminosis D may aggravate the clinical outcome of some genetic and congenital conditions. some human and veterinary bone dysplasias are associated with hypovitaminosis D19,28 or at least show improvement after vitamin D supplementation. micromelic dysplasia-like syndrome should be examined further for the underlying (genetic) cause."}
