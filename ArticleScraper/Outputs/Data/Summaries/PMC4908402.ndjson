{"summary": "Rabbit anti-ACE2, anti-p50, anti-p65, and mouse anti-phospho-p50, anti-phospho-p65 and anti-IB antibodies were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. animals Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150\u2013180 g were obtained from the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of Shanghai Jiaotong University. recombinant Ace2 and small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-Ace2 lentiviruses were cloned into the pSIH1-H1-copGFP shRNA Vector (System Biosciences, California, USA) total RNA was extracted from rat PMVECs cells and reversely transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse Transcriptase. the packaged lentiviruses were designated as Lv-ACE2 and Lv-ACE2-RNAi. rats underwent a midline incision to expose the trachea under isoflurane anesthesia. the trachea was exposed surgically on the ventral side of neck. control rats received 0.9% NaCl solution (500 l) through the tail vein. rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/Kg) and euthanized by exsanguination. pathologist blinded to the experimental group. the final lung injury score was the average score calculated within each experimental group. real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues with Trizol reagent (15596-018, Invitrogen, OR, USA) the membranes were developed with an ECL detection kit (Pierce, IL, USA) the following primers were used: Ace2, Forward primer: 5\u2032-GCTCCTTCTCA-3\u2032, Reverse primer: 5\u2032-GCCGCAGCCTCTCTT-3\u2032, Mas, forward primer: 5\u2032-CCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAGATG-3\u2032, reverse primer: 5\u2032-CCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAGATG-3\u2032. a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-/JNK, anti-phospho-JNK, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) all animals were housed with free access to food and water in temperature-controlled rooms (25 1 \u00b0C) the resultant plasmids were selected and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. total RNA was extracted from rat PMVECs cells and reversely transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse Transcriptase (Takara BIO, Japan) the product was purified and then ligated to the linear lentivector pcDNA-CMV-copGFP cDNA Vector. rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/Kg) and euthanized by exsanguination. a 26# needle was inserted through the tracheal wall into the lumen just blow the larynx. the same injection was performed 7 days later. the supernatant was stored in aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. the right lung was fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde. MAPKs specific inhibitors were pretreated intraperitoneally at 10 min before LPS administration. the equal amounts of protein (100 g) were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST at room temperature for 2 h. then incubated with primary antibody against rat ACE2 (1:800), ERK1/2 (1:600), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:400), JNK (1:500), phosphorylated JNK (1:800), p38 MAPK (1:800), phosphorylated reaction mixture containing 2 l cDNA, 0.4 l primer F, 0.4 l primer R, and 10 l SYBR premix Ex Taq (DRR041A, Takara) was diluted to 20 l with RNase dH2O. the reaction conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 sec, 60 \u00b0C for 20 sec and 72 \u00b0C for 20 sec. a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results showed high efficiency of Ace2 or Ace2-shRNA gene transfer into rat lung via intratracheal injection. ACE2 prevents rat from LPS-induced acute lung injury. ACE2 overexpression in rat lung markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and decreased the lung injury score and BALF protein level. pretreatment with either A779, a potent antagonist of Ang-(1-7) via competitively binding with its specific Mas receptor, significantly inhibited the protective effects of ACE2 on LPS-induced lung injury. ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) markedly dropped from 2.12 in the LPS group to 0.68 in the LPS+ACE2 group. ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) notably increased to 5.63 and 6.83 in LPS+ACE2+A779 group and LPS+ACE2+MLN4760 group. the increased levels of TNF-, IL-1 IL-6 and IL-10 caused by LPS administration were all further promoted by ACE2 knockdown. ACE2 knockdown in rat lung also promoted IL-10 level in rat. ACE2 overexpression reversed LPS-induced ACE2 decrease and enhanced Mas mRNA increase in lung LPS administration resulted in a significant decrease of ACE2 protein in rat lungs. the up-regulated ACE2 protein expression in rat lung by Lenti-Ace2 was suppressed by MLN-4760 pretreatment before LPS injection. treatment with a779 or MLN-4760 before LPS administration significantly reduced the expression of Mas mRNA in lung tissue. ACE2 overexpression significantly suppressed the phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK in lung tissue of rats receiving LPS. ACE2 knock down in rat lung significantly enhanced the LPS-induced increase of ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation in rat lung. there was no significant difference in p38 MAPK phosphorylation level between the LPS+ACE2-RNAi group and the LPS group. lung injury was also attenuated by MPAKs inhibitors prior to LPS administration. however, there was no statistical difference between the rats with or without MPAKs inhibitor pretreatment in the LPS+ACE2+A779 group and LPS+ACE2+MLN4760 group. data are represented as mean SD. ACE2 inhibits LPS-induced cytokine secretion in rat lung. ACE2 overexpression in the rat lung markedly suppressed LPS-induced NF-B p50 and p65 phosphorylation and enhanced the expression of IB. ACE2 down-regulation further enhanced LPS-induced increase of NF-B p65 phosphorylation level in lung tissue. ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in rat lung were increased by 9.47 and 4.21 fold. ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in rat lung were decreased by 52% and 80%. ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in rat lung were decreased by 52% and 80%. ACE2 overexpression in rat lung markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury. the lung injury score and BALF protein level were significantly increased. ACE2 attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory response and reverses Ang II/Ang-. ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) markedly dropped from 2.12 in the LPS group to 0.68 in the LPS+ACE2 group. ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) notably increased to 5.63 and 6.83 in LPS+ACE2+A779 group and LPS+ACE2+MLN4760 group. ACE2 overexpression markedly suppressed the TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6 secretion. the increased levels of TNF-, IL-1 and IL-10 caused by LPS administration were all further promoted by ACE2 knockdown. ACE2 knockdown in rat lung also promoted IL-10 level in BALF. ACE2 overexpression reversed LPS-induced ACE2 decrease and enhanced Mas mRNA increase in lung LPS administration resulted in a significant decrease of ACE2 protein in rat lungs. mRNA expression in lung tissue of rat transduced with Lenti-Ace2 was markedly reduced by A779 or MLN-4760 treatment before LPS injection. there was no significant difference in Mas mRNA expression between LPS+ACE2+MLN-4760 group and control group. ACE2 knock down in rat lung significantly enhanced the LPS-induced increase of ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation in rat lung. there was no significant difference in p38 MAPK phosphorylation level between the LPS+ACE2-RNAi group and the LPS group. ACE2+A779 group and LPS+ACE2+MLN4760 group were significantly reduced by SB203580, PD98059 or SP600125 pretreatment. the LPS-induced lung injury was also attenuated by MPAKs inhibitors prior to LPS administration in rats of these two groups. however, there was no statistical difference between the rats with or without MPAKs inhibitor pretreatment. hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissues with eosin and hematoxylin. eosin inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-B pathway in rat. ACE2 overexpression in the rat lung markedly suppressed NF-B p50 and p65 phosphorylation and enhanced the expression of IB. the NF-B p65 phosphorylation level was higher in the LPS+ACE2+A779 and LPS+ACE2+MLN4760 group than the LPS group. ACE2 knockdown caused a marked deterioration of lung injury and increase of cytokine secretion in rats receiving LPS injection. recombinant ACE2 attenuated the symptoms of ARDS in mice. down-regulation of ACE2 expression in lung and increased serum Ang II level are associated with severity of respiratory syncytial virus H7N9 or H5N1-induced ARDS. decrease of ACE2 activity in rat lung reduced the BALF Ang II level and further increased Ang-(1-7) level in animals treated with LPS. Ang-(1-7), the major product of ACE2, stimulates downstream Mas receptors to oppose the effects of Ang II/AT1R38,39. Ang-(1-7) overexpression in lung tissue prevented bleomycin-induced lung injury, and blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) against monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. ACE2 knockdown remarkably suppressed expression of ACE2 in lung tissue. blockade of ACE2 also significantly suppressed expression of mRNA. underlying molecular mechanism of ACE2 protects against ARDS remains elusive. ACE2 regulates the balance of AngII/Ang(1-7) to prevent alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis and JNK phosphorylation. pretreatment with A779 abolishes the anti-apoptotic effect of Ang-(1-7) and its inhibition of JNK phosphorylation46. ACE2 over-expression in PMVECs protects LPS-induced apoptosis and suppresses p38 MAPK Imai et al. identified the TLR4-NF-B signaling pathway as a key role in controlling severity of acute lung injury24. overexpressing ACE2 in the rat lung significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-B p50/p65 phosphorylation and enhanced IB expression, which was completely reversed by ACE2 inhibitor pretreatment. clinically, intravenous administration of recombinant human ACE2 results in increased, decreased or unchanged Ang-(1-7) serum concentration without cardiovascular effects51. ang-(1-7) administration led to a decrease of plasma placental growth factor level in cancer patient with clinical benefit52, suggesting that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway is a promising therapeutic target of ARDS."}
