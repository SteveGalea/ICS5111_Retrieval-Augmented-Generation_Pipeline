EMSA Same as anti-HBV activity analysis in vitro, Mucroporin-M1 was added to the cell cultures for 2 days in qPCR. total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and was transcribed into cDNA using the first-Strand Synthesis Supermix (Invitrogen) the primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2, rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2, rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p38, rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p38, mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-SAPK-JNK. their molecular weights, as measured by MS, matched the calculated molecular weights of the amidated peptides. the sequence alignments of Mucroporin-M1 with other antimicrobial peptides were performed using ClustalX and BioEdit. the residues shaded in the same color are highly conserved sites. the residues in similar color are less conserved sites. mucroporin-M1 inhibited 50% of cell growth (CC50) when the peptide concentration was less than 25 m, the viability of the peptide-treated cells was greater than 90%. the effect of mucroporin-M1 on HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells was assessed. 3TC inhibited HBV DNA synthesis effectively in hepG2.2.15 cells. HBV RNA expression was also potently inhibited by mucroporin-M1 in HepG2.2.15 cells. intracellular relaxed circle (RC), double strand (DS) and single strand (SS) DNA synthesis was reduced after treatment with the indicated concentrations of Mucroporin-M1 or 3TC. mucroporin-M1 inhibited HBV RNA production in a dose-dependent manner. mucroporin-M1 reduced the expression of HBsAg in the blood of the HBV-infected mice by ELISA. B, inhibitory activity of Mucroporin-M1 against HBeAg in the blood of the HBV-infected mice. mucroporin-M1 selectively inhibited the HBV promoter (preC/Cp) but not the CMV promoter. the activity of Core promoter with a mutant HNF4a binding site was not affected by Mucroporin-M1 peptide. the expression of HNF4 in the HepG2.2.15 cells treated with Mucroporin-M1 was quantified by real-time PCR. it has been reported that hepatocyte nuclear transcriptional factors, together with viral proteins, bind to the HBV promoters. luciferase activities showed that the activity of HBV core promoter with a mutant HNF4 binding site was almost not inhibited by Mucroporin-M1 treatment. the data suggests that the HNF4 binding site specifically played an important role in the HBV inhibitory activity of Mucroporin-M1 peptide. the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 were all increased after treatment with 25 m peptide. but the MAPK pathways were not activated in HepG2 cells. phosphorylation of 1/2, p38, and p38 inhibited by upstream inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. mucroporin-M1 activated ERK1/2 and JNK in HBV-harboring mice. but not activated ERK1/2 and JNK in the normal mice. pERK, ERK, pJNK, JNK, phosphorylated p38 and p38 from HepG2.2.15 cells and HepG2 cells. western blot analyzed 20-microgram quantities of nuclear proteins from HepG2.2.15 cells (mock) without Mucroporin-M1 treatment or preincubation with PD98059, SP600125, and SB203580 before Mucroporin-M1 treatment. ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways were activated in HBV-infected mice treated with an intravenous injection of Mucroporin-M1 peptide mucroporin-M1 activates the MAPK pathway (ERK, JNK, and p38) and subsequently down-regulates the expression of HNF4. these findings indicate that the ERK and JNK pathways regulate the expression of HNF4 but that the p38 pathway does not. the mucroporin-M1 peptide may be a good molecular probe for studying the MAPK pathway. scorpion venom peptides were tested at a concentration of 25 m for inhibitory activity against HBV replication in the HepG2.2.15 cell line. incubation with the Mucroporin-M1 peptide resulted in an 80% reduction in the amount of HBeAg and HBsAg present in the culture medium. the effect of mucroporin-M1 on HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells was assessed. the cells were cultured in the presence of serial dilutions of the peptide. the IC50 values of mucroporin-M1 against HBsAg and HBeAg were 20.6 and 4.9 m. 3TC did not inhibit viral Core protein synthesis, as expected. the results showed that the mucroporin-M1 peptide had anti-HBV activity. extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg production decreased in a dose-dependent manner. mucroporin-M1 inhibited HBV RNA production in a dose-dependent manner, but 3TC did not. mice that were not administered pUC18-HBV1.3 did not have viral antigens in their blood. mucroporin-M1 decreased the expression of HBV Core protein in the hepatocytes of HBV-infected mice treated by Mucroporin-M1. the frequency of HBV Core protein-positive hepatocytes was 4% 2% in mucroporin-M1-treated mice compared with 13% 3% in untreated mice. this led to reduced HBV antigen secretion in mouse blood. BV four promoter activities were partially inhibited by mucroporin-M1 peptide. luciferase expression decreased to 20% of the negative control level after mucroporin-M1 peptide treatment. but the CMV promoter was not affected. the expression of porin-M1 was quantified by real-time PCR. it has been reported that hepatocyte nuclear transcriptional factors, together with viral proteins, bind to the HBV promoters and modulate viral promoter activity (23\u201326). mucroporin-M1 down-regulated the expression of HNF4 and inhibited HBV promoter activity. the decrease in HNF4 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells could also explain the inhibition of other viral protein promoters that was observed. mucroporin-M1 inhibited ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, respectively. inhibition of ERK activation partially overcame mucroporin-M1-mediated down-regulation of HNF4. inhibition of ERK activation completely blocked mucroporin-M1-mediated down-regulation of HNF4. pERK, ERK, pJNK, JNK, phosphorylated p38 and p38 from HepG2.2.15 cells and HepG2 cells, with or without treatment of Mucroporin-M1 were analyzed by Western blot analysis. pERK, ERK, pJNK, and phosphorylated p38-producing cells were untreated or treated with 50 m PD98059 (inhibiting pER inhibitory effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on anti-HBV activity of mucroporin-M1 in vivo.

HBsAg accumulated to an average concentration of 21.6 PEIU/ml in the untreated mice. the concentration of HBsAg in the blood of the mucroporin-M1-treated mice decreased from 10.4 PEIU/ml to 4.8 PEIU/ml in the mucroporin-M1-treated group. the frequency of HBV Core protein-positive hepatocytes was 4% 2% in mucroporin-M1-treated mice compared with 13% 3% in untreated mice. thus, the mucroporin-M1 peptide inhibited HBV replication in mouse hepatocytes and reduced HBV antigen secretion in mouse blood. this results suggested that the active target of mucroporin-M1 is the viral RNA transcription step and not the HBV mucroporin-M1 selectively inhibited the HBV promoter (preC/Cp) but not the CMV promoter. hepatocyte nuclear transcriptional factors, together with viral proteins, have been reported. DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the HBV promoter/Enh II sequence HNF4, HNF3 and Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) were synthesized and biotin-labeled for electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. nuclear extracts from HepG2.2.15 cells treated with 25 m Mucroporin-M1 or left untreated were incubated with the probes to determine whether Mucroporin-M1 alters the binding the reduction in HNF4 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells could also explain the inhibition of other viral protein promoters (pSp, Sp, and Xp) that was observed. the activated MAPK pathway proteins exogenous signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been reported to control HNF4 expression (10, 11) inhibition of JNK activation partially overcame mucroporin-M1-mediated down-regulation of HNF4. inhibition of ERK activation completely blocked mucroporin-M1-mediated down-regulation of HNF4. p38 inhibitor is able to block activation of p38 that is mediated by mucroporin-M1. the pERK, pJNK, and phosphorylated p38-producing cells were untreated or treated with 50 m PD98059 (inhibiting pERK), SP600125 (inhibiting pJNK) or SB203580 (inhibiting phosphorylated p38) for 30 min prior to stimulation with Mucroporin-M1. the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways were activated in HBV-infected mice treated with an intravenous injection of Mucroporin-M1. the expression of the HBV Core protein was also significantly reduced in mouse hepatocytes after intravenous injection of Mucroporin-M1 peptide. mucroporin-M1 (21), Ctriporin (22) and other venom-derived peptides were synthesized at a purity of >95% by GL Biochem Ltd. (China) their molecular weights, as measured by MS, matched the calculated molecular weights of the amidated peptides. the mucroporin-M1 peptide inhibited the production of extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg. the other peptides had little effect on the amount of secreted HBsAg and HBeAg. IC50 values of mucroporin-M1 against HBsAg and HBeAg production were 20.6 and 4.9 m, respectively. production of HBV progeny DNA was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Mucroporin-M1. extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg production decreased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with the indicated concentrations of Mucroporin-M1. HBsAg accumulated to an average concentration of 21.6 PEIU/ml in the untreated mice. HBsAg accumulated to an average concentration of 21.6 PEIU/ml in the untreated mice. the amount of HBeAg decreased from 10.4 PEIU/ml in the untreated group to 4.8 PEIU/ml in the mucroporin-M1-treated group. the mice that were not administered pUC18-HBV1.3 did not have detectable viral antigens in their blood. mucroporin-M1 reduced the HBV RNA transcript levels, leading to reduced HBV antigen secretion in mouse hepatocytes. the active target of mucroporin-M1 is the viral RNA transcription step and not the HBV DNA polymerase, unlike other anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analogs. mucroporin-M1 significantly reduced the binding of HNF4 to the HBV promoter (preC/Cp) the activity of Core promoter with a mutant HNF4 binding site was not affected by 25 m Mucroporin-M1 peptide. the binding to the HNF4 probe was significantly decreased after treatment with 25 m Mucroporin-M1. the binding to the HNF3 DNA probe was decreased after treatment with the mucroporin-M1 peptide, but the difference was not significant. however, the binding of the nuclear extract to FTF did not yield a distinctive shift. mucroporin-M1 down-regulated the expression of HNF4, inhibited HBV promoter activity, and further reduced the levels of the HBV transcript. ERK1/2, p38, and p38 were all increased after treatment with 25 m peptide, but the MAPK pathways were not activated in HepG2 cells. anti-HBV activity of mucroporin-M1 blocked by inhibition of JNK and ERK activation. p38 inhibitor is able to block activation of p38 that is mediated by mucroporin-M1. phosphorylated MAPK proteins were examined by western blot analysis. the pERK, pJNK, and phosphorylated p38-producing cells were untreated or treated with 50 m PD98059 (inhibiting pERK), SP600125 (inhibiting pJNK) or SB203580 (inhibiting phosphorylated p38) for 30 min prior to stimulation with mucroporin-M1. the MAP kinase inhibitors blocked mucroporin-M1-induced activ mice treated by intravenous injection of mucroporin-M1 peptide. group P, mice treated by both HBV plasmid and saline. results demonstrated that the mucroporin-M1 peptide selectively activated ERK1/2 and JNK and subsequently down-regulated HNF4 expression. a myristoylated peptide derived from the large HBV envelope protein blocks virus entry to hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. no research has yet reported an agent that activates the MAPK pathway and inhibits HBV replication. this antiviral mechanism was not effective against DNA viruses and virally infected cells. mucroporin-M1 inhibited HBV replication by activating MAPKs. the MAPK pathway plays an important role in innate immunity. pathogens stimulate and activate the MAPK pathway, which induces innate immune responses. mucroporin-M1 inhibited the expression of HNF4 by activating ERK1/2 or JNK. this result confirmed that the expression of HNF4 was regulated by the ERK and JNK pathways (10, 35) p38 was also activated by mucroporin-M1, but it did not impact HNF4 expression. not activate the phosphorylation of ERKs, p38, and JNK in normal mice. this selective activation of MAPK pathways contributes to reduce the adverse effect of persistent activation of MAPK pathway. a triple intravenous dose of the mucroporin-M1 peptide did not influence mouse survival. a gene chip-based study found that HNF4 might be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response in the liver (39)."}
