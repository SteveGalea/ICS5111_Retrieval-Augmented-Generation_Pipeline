GIS point-in-polygon analysis can be used to examine spatial patterns in health outcomes in relation to socio-economic characteristics of areas. higgs and Richards used GIS to examine the socio-demographic profiles of patients on a dental practice register in Wales. disease incidence and other spatio-temporal epidemiological events are portrayed on these maps as shaded polygons (each representing an administrative area) each of these polygons contains a numerical value of the mapped disease incidence represented as a shaded value within the covered national framework. filtered map using a non-overlapping, variable-size, spatial filter. data for such areas can be easily encoded from the information provided. health data are better examined by methods that assume disease rates are spatially continuous. ing software is used to create isarithmic maps in which regions with a constant range of values can be recognised. the spatial filter is defined in terms of constant or near constant population size rather than constant geographic size. this means that circles will usually be larger in the rural areas compared to urban areas (higher population density) al used trend surface maps to overcome drawbacks of administrative boundary choropleth maps (e.g., ward-based maps in the UK) they also used animated sequences of trend surface maps to study the waves of diffusion of problematic drug misuse across time. the method represents a sum statistic and procedure for the monitoring of changes in spatial pattern for observations processed sequentially [20]. spatial data mining The Amsterdam police department uses spatial data mining technology from Sentient http://www.sentient.nl/. telegeoprocessing and mobile GIS Xue et al define telegeoprocessing as a new discipline revolving around real-time spatial databases that are updated regularly by means of telecommunications systems. mobile phones and other digital devices are rapidly gaining location awareness and Web connectivity, promising new spatial technology applications that will yield vast amounts of spatial information. higgs and Richards explored the use of two different deprivation indices in their study, namely the Index of multiple deprivation (IMD) and the Townsend index. deprivation indices are frequently used in relation to health needs assessment and in resource allocation. choropleth map could be considered a filtered map using a non-overlapping, variable-size, spatial filter with filter shapes selected from available political or administrative regions. choropleth map could be considered a filtered map using a non-overlapping, variable-size, spatial filter with filter shapes selected from available political or administrative regions. a spatial filter can be applied to individual point data, as well as to data aggregated into small census areas. in its simplest form, the estimated rate at a particular location is defined as the observed rate within a fixed distance from the grid point. contouring software is used to create isarithmic maps in which regions with a constant range of values can be recognised. the accuracy of kriging results depends on the aggregation level of the data used. trend surface maps are commonly used to report the spatial diffusion process of disease epidemics (the movement of epidemics across geographical space) spatial pattern surveillance is a surveillance method for detecting changes in spatial pattern in cases over time relative to the population-at-risk. the method represents a sum statistic and procedure for the monitoring of changes in spatial pattern for observations processed sequentially. high-resolution satellite imagery provides detailed digital representations of existing landscapes and land covers. remotely sensed data are being used both in historical and real-time modes to assess and model catastrophic health events. changes have implications in public health and are necessary to properly establish and revise community health priorities and plans. environmental monitors measure air and water quality, solar irradiation, radon gas levels, and other exposures potentially deleterious to human health. these measurements can be brought into GIS, spatially referenced and integrated analytically with other health predictor variables and outcome data. the determination of effective response time zones for the provision of emergency care services is another application already benefiting from the unique capabilities of GIS. in the same asthma scenario described by Richards et al, most affected individuals in the hospital with the highest rate happened to work at the same factory. an appropriate action was initiated in the form of a request that an industrial hygienist visits the plant the same day. real-time GIS applications in health and environmental surveillance, and in emergency and epidemics management are presented later in this paper. a number of studies have used GIS to study disease patterns, spatio-temporal variations in health outcomes, and identify possible causes of mapped patterns. field et al developed a GIS drug misuse system to create a dynamic model for forecasting and displaying spatio-temporal trends. it includes a range of parameters to model drug misuse and its geographic spread across a population using UK data as a basis for developing a european-wide forecasting system. their approach provides the basis for examining more complex geographic diffusion scenarios such as the introduction of new practices by new users. it is planned for this Swedish atlas to be expanded and updated regularly with an increasing number of determinants. a network of researchers and practitioners from various institutions in Sweden is preparing for a training course on spatial analysis research. a textbook on spatial analysis in Sweden is also planned. access block is the prime symptom of supply/demand mismatch in hospital bed stock in australia. it may result in ambulance bypass, increased ED waiting time and casualty queues, increased patient complaints, and adverse media attention. a number of studies have used GIS to study disease patterns (e.g., identify leukaemia clusters), spatio-temporal variations in health outcomes, and identify possible causes of mapped patterns. these generally involve the linkage of health information with environmental and socio-economic data. GIS can also target resources for disease prevention by highlighting areas with significantly high rates. health figures for the WHO European Region cover basic demographic data, mortality and morbidity, lifestyles and environmental indicators, and types and levels of healthcare. most indicators are presented as a map to show overall regional variations, a bar chart to indicate country rankings, and a time chart to show trends over time in three main country groupings. GIS have been used in a number of studies to estimate the best/optimal location for a new clinic, hospital or GP surgery. others have had access to spatially disaggregated data. access block is the prime symptom of supply/demand mismatch in hospital bed stock in Australia. DRMC is using a large, multi-layered, GIS-enabled patient care and room management system. the system captures, logs, manages, and analyses a vast array of information about patients checking in, switching rooms, checking out, and moving from in-hospital to outpatient care. there is little evidence that GIS are being considered or regularly used in strategic decision-making, e.g., major healthcare planning within the NHS. data-rich records kept by GPs remain a relatively untapped resource. information for health also calls for data sharing between NHS and non-NHS organisations in order to tackle health issues. linkages between poor health and unemployment, housing, crime, and education are major drivers. there is no explicit mention of the potential for geo-information and GIS in addressing these aims. it is astonishing that there is no explicit mention of the potential for geo-information and GIS in addressing these aims. this author was able to spot several local implementation documents on the web mentioning the use of GIS. sporadic levels of GIS use in mostly low-level, non-strategic tasks within the NHS. these studies pointed to sporadic levels of GIS use in mostly low-level, non-strategic tasks within the NHS. this was attributed to a lack of spatial data-handling skills within the NHS and the failure to realise the value of geographical information. the findings were replicated in a study conducted in the later part of the 1990s by Smith and Jarvis (1998 \u2013 cited in [28,35]). they found that GIS use has again tended to be uncoordinated and low-level in nature, because of a lack of policy directives concerning appropriate systems, as well as a general lack of high quality data. cooper advocates the setting up of regional health GIS centres. regional services could be responsible for coordinating data collection at the regional level. PHOs have been set up in each NHS region to draw information from sources. rates have been directly standardised for age using the European Standard Population and are expressed as a rate per 100,000 population. incidence data are provided by the west Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit. the presence of an effective infrastructure of GIS advice, guidance, and support available to NHS organisations could explain the observed patterns of health organisations that are GIS users or nonusers. the production of maps was undertaken in 96% of the health authorities and 67% of the health trusts that reported using GIS in 2001. the lack of a clear organisational policy for exchanging data was among the most significant data exchange constraints identified by health authorities and trusts. the lack of a clear organisational policy for exchanging data was among the most significant data exchange constraints identified by health authorities and trusts. the lack of a clear organisational policy for exchanging data was among the most significant data exchange constraints identified by health authorities and trusts. the survey could be used as a baseline with which to monitor the impacts of current and future organisational restructuring on the use of GIS within the NHS [35,53]. data-rich records kept by GPs remain a relatively untapped resource particularly in the areas of local health surveillance, service audit and resource targeting. there is no mention of the potential for geo-information and GIS in addressing these aims. there is also no mention of the potential for partnership approaches for providing and exchanging information on such issues at either national or local scales. sporadic levels of GIS use in mostly low-level, non-strategic tasks within the NHS. a study commissioned by the Association for Geographic Information noted that GIS uptake was hindered by the low level of awareness of the value of GIS in spatially representing population and health needs-based information. the results were replicated in a study conducted in the later part of the 1990s. they found that GIS use has again tended to be uncoordinated and low-level in nature. they noted a particular lack of collaboration between GIS academics and healthcare practitioners/managers. two thirds of surveyed health authorities said that GIS was being under-utilised. cited the high costs of digital geographical data and lack of resources for training and work-time constraints for NHS personnel. cooper advocates the setting up of regional health GIS centres. interactive map-based web site for sharing health, and related socio-economic and environmental data from different organisations for the West Midlands Region [52]. MAIGIS Screenshot of MAIGIS showing an interactive map of the incidence rates by PCG (Primary Care Group) of prostate cancer in the West Midlands Region over the five year aggregated period 1995\u20131999. Rates have been directly standardised for age using the European Standard Population. 56% of health trusts within this active subset reported having fully operational GIS. trusts include ambulance services NHS trusts that are using GIS in real-time emergency service despatching and control. cancer intelligence units that are using GIS to examine spatial patterns of disease incidence. more significant number of health authorities were reported exchanging data with external organisations. obstacles included work-time constraints, lack of skills and insufficient training or guidance. lack of a clear organisational policy for exchanging data was among most significant data exchange constraints identified by health authorities. higgs et al's survey could be used as a baseline with which to monitor the impacts of current and future organisational restructuring on the uses of GIS within the NHS [35,53]. a national geo-information infrastructure can also support real-time GIS applications in public health. NSDI requires a culture of data sharing to exist within a country. the benefits associated with data sharing should be researched to encourage wide participation. universities should be encouraged to work with local organisations. a mature NSDI can only be achieved through simple and smaller solutions. it is recommended that a top down approach is combined with a pragmatic bottom up approach. a mature NSDI can only be achieved through simpler and smaller solutions. infrastructure for geo-information use is becoming as important to african countries as the building of roads and telecommunication networks. a country's ability to use geo-information effectively depends on the existence and proper investment into the provision and maintenance of up-to-date core digital geo-datasets. ArcCatalog enables users to view their GIS data holdings. users can create a central, online metadata repository for publishing metadata. policies should start by removing barriers to access, e.g., excessive costs to use an information product or lack of clarity concerning copyright. a 140-page report commissioned by the world health organisation \u2013 regional office for Africa (WHO-AFRO) proposes a programme of action to advance environmental health hazard mapping in africa. this includes the following elements: data modelling, developing and adapting health indicators according to specific local user needs. training should cover epidemiological methods to ensure appropriate use of GIS technology in public health. the cost of training programs offered by commercial GIS vendors and solution providers can be a financial burden. training materials should be offered in a variety of formats to facilitate distance learning (e.g., CD-ROMs and self-instruction Web-based courses) William F. Davenhall, ESRI Health and Human Service Solutions Manager, describes an ambitious vision of a Community Health Surveillance System (CHSS \u2013 see later) spanning wide geographic areas, and mentions the following success factors [2]: (1) Community data sharing must be systematic and regular [2] (4) Adopting data standards and sharing agreements will ensure a CHSS works effectively in real time [2]. Wagner et al found that a key element for success included the deep understanding of the healthcare products industry provided to them by an industry expert. a personal invitation sent to the CEO of relevant corporations for participation (sharing of otherwise proprietary data), authored by a highly respected government or public health official. promoting and disseminating good practice examples of GIS use in healthcare should be highlighted. such \"raising awareness\" activities are vital given the need to build business cases for the development of GIS within NHS organisations. a suitable policy and funding must be established. community/university research collaboration is a relatively new research paradigm that has recently become a major strategic theme of health funding agencies in Canada and elsewhere. their specific project objectives were to develop and iteratively refine via active community/university collaboration a GIS for ready access to routinely collected health data. data describing respiratory health included census, cartographic files, land use, traffic volume, air monitoring and emissions, and consumer spending patterns. data describing outcomes of respiratory health included hospital separations (similar to Hospital Episode Statistics in England \u2013 see http://www.doh.gov.uk/hes/) difficulties encountered in acquiring data indicate privacy concerns present a serious barrier to system development. a wide range of stakeholders in society must collectively address the issues of privacy and stewardship of population health data [8]. community partners tend to see potential conflicts between service provision and research demands. university partners tend to see the collaboration as posing threats to research rigor, control over the research process and constraints on publication opportunities. issues that shaped and influenced the collaborative process and partnership. public health needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole. public health needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole. public health needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole. there is no limit on the number of WME partners. any agency can participate by adding its own data layer(s) to existing ones. public health databases are not yet included in WME. there are no one-size-fits-all indicators that suit all users. an indicator profile specifies the environmental health hazard(s) to which the indicator relates, the indicator's rationale and role, any alternative methods and definitions, any related indicators, sources of further information and a listing of involved agencies. in 2000, the US National Association of County and City Health Officials \u2013 NACCHO has produced a comprehensive list of core and extended health indicators. the CDC national public health performance standards programme (NPHPSP) is a more current partnership effort to improve the practice of public health, the performance of public health systems and the infrastructure supporting public health. NPHPSP developed performance standards and matching assessment instruments for state and local public health systems. the health data model is a conceptually related collaborative project to develop a generic data model for health applications, using ESRI software. the results will be a basic data model with three components. NACCHO and WHO-AFRO have developed POPULIS, a health information system. POPULIS reports on the health of a population and the relationship between health and the use of healthcare services. the higher a region's score on this index, the higher the death rate is among its residents. POPULIS has missed a lot by not being a GIS-enabled system. the original POPULIS (based on Statistical Analysis System) proved hard to maintain and not scalable. a more recent publication by Roos in 1999 has moved from describing POPULIS as a SAS front-end or software program to presenting it as a framework or approach. the OpenGIS Consortium (OGC) develops specifications to accommodate operational differences. XML encoding of geodata makes it possible to display, overlay, and analyse geodata on any Web browser. XML is also used for encoding spatial metadata. users query a Web server with an OGC Web Service Interface. the interface enables standardised access to a feature store. users no longer need to care whether the underlying store is from ESRI, Oracle or IBM. GML contains map \"content\" only (e.g., where features are, their geometry, type and attributes) this allows different \"stylesheets\" to be applied to the geographic data to make it appear. the new release is modular, allowing users to pick out only the schemas or schema components that apply to their work. the real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system uses the HL7 message protocol to receive clinical encounter data from participating hospitals in real time. the US Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections System is basing its seven syndromic surveillance categories on groups of related ICD codes. a potential problem arises in case one wants to optimise the use of multiple databases when a query joins data from several different databases at the same time. the federated database technology's optimiser is aware of the available processing resources in other databases and organises query responses appropriately [67,74]. conflation is the ability to precisely geo-reference variant data layers compiled into one view. this can be crucial in emergency situations such as terrorist and bioterrorist attacks. lack of automated conflation methods following the fall 2001 world trade centre attack resulted in time-consuming problems for emergency response teams. GIS software tools are needed that are specifically custom-designed for use in public health. future health GIS applications will \"know\" which data silos are needed and where they are located. future health GIS applications will \"know\" which data silos are needed and where they are located. -based health GIS services must ensure Section 508 compliance with the Rehabilitation Act Amendments http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html and http://www.section508.gov/. the UK/EU equivalent of these accessibility requirements can be consulted online [77,78]. html is a free-to-use online tool available from the Pennsylvania State University web site. it is designed to help people select good colour schemes for maps and other graphics. the reader is referred to CDC's Oral Health Maps, Heart Disease and Stroke Maps and Atlas of Reproductive Health. a culture of data sharing must exist within a country. the benefits associated with data sharing should be researched to encourage wide participation. universities should be encouraged to work with local organisations. responsibilities among stakeholders must be clarified at an early stage, including the lead role. a mature NSDI can only be achieved through simpler and smaller solutions. short-term bottom up projects will provide valuable experience that can feed into formulation of NSDI policy and strategy. infrastructure for geo-information use is becoming as important to african countries as the building of roads and telecommunication networks. investing in a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) underpins the provision of many essential services. a country's ability to use geo-information effectively depends on the existence and proper investment into the provision and maintenance of up-to-date core digital geo-datasets. ArcCatalog enables users to view their GIS data holdings. users can create a central, online metadata repository for publishing and browsing metadata over the Internet. policies should start by removing barriers to access, e.g., excessive costs to use an information product or lack of clarity concerning copyright. if various institutions pursue singular, uncoordinated agendas, they should ensure that all captured and generated data and information conform to common standards. such frameworks should specify which organisations are gathering which kinds of information, how the information will be captured, and arrangements for data sharing. policymakers need to be engaged in the process through awareness training, briefings, and support. training should cover epidemiological methods to ensure appropriate use of GIS technology in public health. the cost of training programs offered by commercial GIS vendors and solution providers can be a financial burden. the time required for training can be also a challenge for organisations in which demands on personnel are already high. the real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system is a computerised public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks, including those caused by bioterrorism. the system was used during the 2002 winter Olympics and currently operates in two US states \u2013 Pennsylvania and Utah. a \"national\" approach should be formed into industry-based data utilities (services independent of any particular user interface) a key element for success included the deep understanding of the healthcare products industry provided to them by an industry expert. a personal invitation sent to the CEO of relevant corporations for participation (sharing of otherwise proprietary data), authored by a highly respected government or public health official. successful examples of collaborative projects involved the use of GIS should be highlighted. such \"raising awareness\" activities are vital given the need to build business cases for the development of GIS within NHS organisations and to show the capabilities and \"business benefits\" of GIS to directors. community/university research collaboration is a relatively new research paradigm that has recently become a major strategic theme of health funding agencies in Canada and elsewhere. the project was to develop and iteratively refine via active community/university collaboration a GIS for ready access to routinely collected health data. data describing respiratory health included census, cartographic files, land use, traffic volume, air monitoring and emissions, and consumer spending patterns. data describing outcomes of respiratory health included hospital separations (similar to Hospital Episode Statistics in England \u2013 see http://www.doh.gov.uk/hes/) a wide range of stakeholders must collectively address the issues of privacy and stewardship of population health data [8]. the potential for data display to be misleading and for misinterpretation of data was addressed by providing users with descriptions (metadata) of datasets. university partners tend to see the collaboration as posing threats to research rigor. leadership style, vision, commitment to the idea of community/university collaboration, at least small amounts of \"seed funding\" and willingness to learn from failures all appear to be significant features in successful collaborations. universities should foster community/university research partnerships. public health needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole. public health needs to be an integral part of a larger structural, multi-agency whole. public health databases are not yet included in WME, but there are no specific barriers to inclusion. data models explicitly define how concepts within data sources relate to each other. there are no one-size-fits-all indicators that suit all users. an indicator profile specifies the environmental health hazard(s) to which the indicator relates, the indicator's rationale and role, any alternative methods and definitions, any related indicators, sources of further information and a listing of involved agencies. nACCHO has produced a comprehensive list of core and extended health indicators as part of their Community Health Status Assessment toolbox. the CDC national public health performance standards programme (NPHPSP \u2013 http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/nphpsp/index.asp. NPHPSP describes ten \"essential public health services\" that provide the fundamental framework for NPHPSP instruments. the health data model (HDM) is a conceptually related project to develop a generic data model for health applications, using ESRI software. WHO-AFRO has developed POPULIS, a POPULation health information system. it relates to socio-economic factors like education, unemployment, housing, and single parent households. the higher a region's score on this index, the higher the death rate is among its residents. POPULIS has missed a lot by not being a GIS-enabled system. a more recent publication by Roos in 1999 has moved from describing POPULIS as a SAS front-end or software program to presenting it as a framework or approach of concepts, methods, procedures and databases. the OpenGIS Consortium (OGC \u2013 http://www.opengis.org/) develops specifications to accommodate operational differences. the goal is to enable the \"spatial Web\" with products that plug and play across different processing platforms, vendor brands, networks, and programming languages. the OGC interface enables standardised access to a feature store. users no longer need to care whether the underlying store is from ESRI, Oracle or IBM. GML 3 is backwards compatible with GML 2. new features include support for metadata, units of measure, complex geometries, spatial and temporal reference systems. new features include gridded data and default styles for feature and coverage visualisation. the real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system uses the HL7 message protocol to receive clinical encounter data from participating hospitals in real time. the US Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections System is basing its seven syndromic surveillance categories on groups of related ICD codes. a potential problem arises in case one wants to optimise the use of multiple databases when a query joins data from several different databases at the same time. the federated database technology's optimiser is aware of the available processing resources in other databases and organises query responses appropriately [67,74]. conflation is the ability to precisely geo-reference variant data layers compiled into one view. this can be crucial in emergency situations such as terrorist and bioterrorist attacks. new york city is now building automated conflation capability by modifying all city planning spatial databases to include standardised \"hooks\" the ultimate system will be one that is fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretation of integrated data. the ultimate system will be one that is fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretation of integrated data. j.gov/crt/508/508law.html and http://www.section508.gov/ to make complex graphical and mapping files accessible to visually impaired users. the UK/EU equivalents of these accessibility requirements can be consulted online [77,78]. critical information infrastructures are potentially vulnerable to cyber terrorist attacks. a cyber terrorist attack could also be used in support of a physical attack to cause further confusion and possible delays in proper response with greater losses. the lack of spatially-disaggregate data on healthcare utilisation and clinical activity also limits the types and power of healthcare delivery studies that can be carried. the lack of spatially-disaggregate data on healthcare utilisation and clinical activity also limits the types and power of healthcare delivery studies that can be carried. researchers can detect disease clusters or investigate relationships between environmental exposures and disease events. a aggregation level limits the size of clusters that could be detected. a aggregation level limits the size of clusters that could be detected. a third class of geographic masks is aggregation. areal aggregation involves enumerating the total that exists within a region. affine point transformations move these locations deterministically to a new set. a census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county designed to be relatively homogenous with respect to demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and living conditions. the resultant system, SCDHEC's Vital Health and Census Data Integration System, automates geocoding and aggregation of vital records data (births and deaths) each OA contains approximately 125 households. software agents are emerging as an important computing paradigm. if an agent were designed to support the analysis of public health data, users would not be required to have access to confidential health records. XACML, the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language and 7799/ISO 17799 are also very relevant developments in this context. digital rights manangement (DRM), conventionally used for protecting Internet music and films, is now available for other types of digital documents. a \"researchers\" area of the LIBCSP Web site provides applications necessary for access and use of non-public resources. data, information, maps and software that have been approved for public dissemination are available to anyone. this security model allows different levels of access to the data depending on the likelihood that an individual's privacy could be compromised. section 60 of the health and social care Act 2001 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling disclosure of information for specified purposes, without consent, but without breaching common law requirements of confidentiality. other legislation documents to be considered in a UK/European Union (EU) context include EU Data Protection Directives and the related CEN/TC 251 (European standardisation of health informatics) guidance document. et al call for sound epidemiological principles and methods to provide the foundation for the data analyses to be displayed on GIS maps. the cartographer's paradox is that to avoid hiding critical information in a fog of detail, the map must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality. geoffrey Jacquez: pattern recognition requires objective approaches that transcend subjectivity. he says both confirmatory and exploratory analyses spin their wheels because they lack an objective mechanism for identifying and quantifying relationships in the data. they have several initiatives underway in the development of surveillance systems at biomedware. TerraSeer's Cancer Atlas Viewer allows users to visualise and interact with space-time data from the National Cancer Mortality Atlas http://www3.cancer.gov/atlasplus/new.html. users can view the data in the form of maps, animated maps, tables, scatterplots, boxplots, and/or histograms. vistastudio.psu.edu/jsp/jsp/index.jsp is a programming-free, open software development environment designed for geospatial data. it allows users to quickly build applications for geocomputation and geographic visualisation. it is freely distributed over the Web at no cost to academic and non-commercial users. spatial models to better evaluate and distinguish biological, contextual, and ecological effects must be taken into account. understanding the individual's time-space history can provide important (aetiological) information not only for the epidemiologist, but also for the clinician. the problem is particularly acute for diseases that have a long lag or latency period. Oppong describes variations between different locations in data collection methods and standards, in the recorded items, particularly data on patient residence, and in diagnostic standards and case definitions. such variations are often encountered in cancer research (to give an example), and can result in serious problems when pooling data from different locations. a single database may appear to have effective confidentiality safeguards. a false identification may be just as damaging to an individual as a correct identification. the lack of spatially-disaggregate data on healthcare utilisation and clinical activity also limits the types of healthcare delivery studies that can be carried. the ability of researchers to detect disease clusters is affected in four ways. absolute and relative locations within the geographical extent of each area are unobservable. aggregation level used in an analysis limits the size of clusters that could be detected. a third class of geographic masks is aggregation. a third class of geographic masks is aggregation. aggregation involves enumerating the total that exists within a region. a census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county designed to be relatively homogenous with respect to demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and living conditions. the resultant system, SCDHEC's Vital Health and Census Data Integration System, automates geocoding and aggregation of vital records data (births and deaths) each OA contains approximately 125 households. software agents are emerging as an important computing paradigm. HSRC is located within the firewall of a health system. XACML, the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, are also very relevant developments in this context. digital rights manangement (DRM), conventionally used for protecting Internet music and films, is now available for other types of digital documents. a \"Researchers\" area of the LIBCSP Web site provides applications necessary for access and use of non-public resources. data, information, maps and software that have been approved for public dissemination are available to anyone. this security model allows different levels of access to the data depending on the likelihood that an individual's privacy could be compromised. section 60 of the health and social care Act 2001 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations enabling disclosure of information for specified purposes, without consent, but without breaching common law requirements of confidentiality. other legislation documents to be considered in a UK/European Union (EU) context include EU Data Protection Directives and the related CEN/TC 251 (European standardisation of health informatics) guidance document.

GIgateway is an information service providing access to spatial metadata in the UK. the askGIraffe Data Locator is capable of carrying real-time searches across a number of distributed metadata-bases. GIgateway is funded by the UK government and run by the UK Association for Geographic Information. GIgateway Data Locator is intended to help users find and use up-to-date and accurate geographic information on their area, from a range of sources. it features six search methods that can be used any combination to retrieve the results needed. one of these methods allows users to visually select a location using an interactive map of the UK. INSPIRE is the INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe. the Australian Spatial Data Directory (ASDD \u2013 http://www.ga.gov.au/asdd/) provides search interfaces to discover spatial metadata throughout Australia. a global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) is being advanced through the leadership of many nations and organisations represented by a GSDI Steering Committee. distributed geolibraries are modelled on the operations of a traditional library. distributed geolibraries are modelled on the operations of a traditional library. distributed geolibraries are modelled on the operations of a traditional library. a distributed geolibrary is distributed if its users, services, metadata, and information assets can be integrated among many distinct locations. a distributed geolibrary would support collaborative work, such as multidisciplinary research by teams, and decision-making by groups of stakeholders. the success of a distributed geolibrary is largely dependent on the ability to integrate information available about a place. FGDC defines a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) as \"the technology, policies, standards, and human resources necessary to acquire, process, store, distribute, and improve utilisation of geospatial data\" FGDC works to coordinate federal activities regarding the collection, documentation, and dissemination of spatial data. the US health sector is rapidly becoming a responsive and integral part of the NSDI. DHHS is already a member of FGDC, which also has representatives from CDC and NIH. GIgateway is an information service providing access to spatial metadata in the UK. GIgateway's metadata creation tool enables the creation of geographic metadata compliant with GIgateway's Discovery Metadata Specifications. GIgateway data Locator is intended to help users find and use up-to-date and accurate geographic information on their area, from a range of sources. astructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe will trigger the creation of a European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI) that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. a common infrastructure for spatial information in Europe can only be realised in the long run. a common infrastructure for spatial information in Europe can only be realised in the long run. the Australian Spatial Data Directory (ASDD \u2013 http://www.ga.gov.au/asdd/) provides search interfaces to discover spatial metadata throughout Australia. a global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI \u2013 http://www.ga.gov.au/asdd/) is being advanced through the leadership of many nations and organisations represented by a GSDI Steering Committee. a free how-to book, \"Developing Spatial Data Infrastructures: the SDI Cookbook,\" is available in several languages. it includes recommended existing and emerging standards and specifications, as well as business case examples. systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of health information are critical aspects of public health. surveillance was used for acute infectious diseases, but over the past decades there has been a significant expansion of surveillance into new areas of public health concern. a key limitation of the current system is that the lone physician is blind to the cases his or her colleagues are seeing. syndromic surveillance systems must be designed to detect signature patterns of disease in a population. it would be irrational to use only the symptom of fever to attempt to establish a working diagnosis of inhalational anthrax in an individual. a recent review paper by mandl et al provides a comprehensive review of syndromic surveillance systems. GIS technologies and services that can function proactively in real time are extremely and critically important to realise this global public health surveillance vision. such surveillance services also require a sound and comprehensive spatial health information infrastructure to be built and maintained in a coherent way at all operation levels. the same principle also applies to other countries. MAC maintains an extensive array of datasets to ensure their ability to provide their customers with the information they need. MAC can produce GIS maps from important prediction model outputs, e.g., a hurricane wind model, a toxic plume model or an earthquake model. it can also generate maps from damage assessment data after a disaster has occurred to visualise actual damages. the WHO aims to link the Event Management System to its global Atlas of Infectious Diseases http://globalatlas.who.int/globalatlas/interactivemap/rmm/ for real-time mapping and tracking of new outbreaks. web-based maps allow for real-time or near-real-time map updates based on the latest datasets, for interactivity to be incorporated into the maps. some of the best examples of web-based maps were produced during the latest SARS a community health surveillance system (CHSS) is a network that constantly gathers, integrates, and analyses data on health indicators, occurrences, and transmissions of disease in a population. this proactive, geographically based approach can deal more effectively with and provide early warnings of health threats and disease outbreaks, particularly those caused by bioweapons. the rule-based CHSS will use data interpretations made by epidemiologists and other public health officials. the transition from episodic investigation to ongoing monitoring using GIS requires more robust data collection and analysis. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products in a similar manner. but currently receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. it also groups sales data of OTC products into analytic product categories relevant to public health surveillance. sales of OTC healthcare products will increase significantly above the normal, background sales level. the announced longer-term project plans include the expansion of monitoring to the level of selected prescription medications based on another standard coding system that is used in industry data systems. NRDM maps represent a novel approach to presenting surveillance data. they plot how \"unusual\" sales were for the day in question relative to historical patterns of sales for that Zip Code. the colours represent the number of standard deviations by which the observed sales of a product category in a Zip Code deviate from the expected counts. the environmental health surveillance system for Scotland (EHS3) is an ongoing project with funding from Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics. it will be an ongoing multi-agency collaboration involving NHS Board Areas, local authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), water Authorities and other relevant agencies. it will collect, hold and, as appropriate, analyse and interpret temporally and spatially tagged environmental and related health data throughout Scotland. the system will also have potential as a predictive tool for managing weather-related fluctuations in demand for NHS services. a further important characteristic of EHS3 will be its dynamic character. systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of health information are critical aspects of public health. surveillance was used for acute infectious diseases, but over the past decades there has been a significant expansion of surveillance into new areas of public health concern. syndromic surveillance methods that can detect disease at an earlier stage are becoming an important research direction for public health surveillance. syndromic surveillance systems must be designed to detect signature patterns of disease in a population. it would be irrational to use only the symptom of fever to attempt to establish a working diagnosis in an individual. it would be very sensible to consider anthrax release in a community if we were to observe a pattern of 1,000 individuals with fever distributed in a linear streak. a universal multivariate surveillance system can collect, analyse and interpret health-related information worldwide. such surveillance services also require a sound and comprehensive spatial health information infrastructure to be built and maintained in a coherent way at all operation levels. real-time GIS for emergency management Much of the information that underpins emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation is geospatial in nature. MAC maintains an extensive array of datasets to ensure their ability to provide their customers with the information they need. MAC can produce GIS maps from important prediction model outputs, e.g., a hurricane wind model, a toxic plume model or an earthquake model. it can also generate maps from damage assessment data after a disaster has occurred to visualise actual damages. the WHO aims to link the Event Management System to its global Atlas of Infectious Diseases http://globalatlas.who.int/globalatlas/interactivemap/rmm/ for real-time mapping and tracking of new outbreaks. web-based maps allow for real-time or near-real-time map updates based on the latest datasets, for interactivity to be integrated into the maps. some of the best examples of web-based maps were produced during the latest SARS outbreak some of the mapping services presented provided very detailed information down to individual street/building level (in Hong Kong) this kind of support is vital for improving global vigilance and awareness at all levels, and for making well-informed decisions. the rule-based CHSS will use data interpretations made by epidemiologists and other public health officials. the transition from episodic investigation to ongoing monitoring using GIS requires more robust data collection and analysis. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products in a similar manner, but currently receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. a surveillance system with daily batch transfer may delay detection of suspicious events by as long as the time interval (periodicity) between batch transfers. sales of OTC healthcare products will increase significantly above the normal, background sales level. the announced longer-term project plans include the expansion of monitoring to the level of selected prescription medications based on another standard coding system that is used in industry data systems. NRDM maps represent a novel approach to presenting surveillance data. they plot for each Zip Code how \"unusual\" sales were for the day in question relative to historical patterns of sales for that Zip Code. the colours represent the number of standard deviations by which the observed sales of a product category in a Zip Code deviate from the expected counts. the environmental health surveillance system for Scotland (EHS3) is an ongoing project with funding from Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics. it will be an ongoing multi-agency collaboration involving NHS Board Areas, local authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), water Authorities and other relevant agencies. the database will combine information obtained via ad hoc reporting of events, with a systematic active surveillance system. data collection will be ongoing and regular outputs will be agreed. the system will also have potential as a predictive tool for managing environmental occasioned (including weather-related) fluctuations in demand for services. a critical review is needed of the evidence for GIS for specific preventable, mitigable and treatable health conditions. a good starting point may be the CDC \"Guide to Community Preventive Services\" a modified set of definitions and criteria first needs to be developed. focus groups that bring together programme administrators, practitioners and the public are required to complement the expected gaps and deficiencies in current GIS literature. researchers have come to the conclusion that more networking is needed of people, skills, expertise and data. a dedicated web site acting as forum or virtual network on the Web is one way to realise these networks of GIS users. this author thinks that a common coherent UK initiative is urgently needed to build a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. the NHS should also take a closer look at the three sets of standards published by the CDC national public health performance standards programme. the project builds on the Hospital Service Area approach that has been successfully employed by Dr. Wennberg and his Dartmouth colleagues to produce the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care series. the foundation layers for a health spatial data and information infrastructure are best exemplified in the us by PCSAs and Hospital Service Area data layers provided by the Dartmouth Project. in a workshop paper presented in 2001, Professor David Rhind counts about 40 countries developing their national SDIs. the latter include ensuring the involvement of the private sector as a central SDI player from the outset. regional/global geo-information infrastructure can also support real-time GIS public health applications. Developing a culture of data sharing and joined-up working at all levels (local to global) that considers spatial information an asset. training should cover epidemiological methods to ensure appropriate use of GIS technology in public health. public health professional specialties/bodies need to recognise continuing education credit for individuals who participate in GIS software training. some excellent web-based training material and courses are already available free of charge. there is still an urgent need for many more training modules to be developed. existing material includes Rushton's (2003) Short Course on Geocoding. solutions exist that can preserve data confidentiality while still enabling fine-level analyses and reliable results. these solutions involve: the use of statistical and epidemiological methods to mask the geographic location of data in a way that can still permit meaningful analysis. the development and use of software agents and health system resident components that can process an analysis request and return a result to the data user. the ideal tools must be fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of integrated data. the ideal tools are best designed and built to work in modular and nested fashions. professor openshaw thinks that GIS need to adopt and link to technologies that go beyond data collection, management and ownership. short-term bottom-up projects can feed valuable experience into the formulation and revision of the relevant policies and strategies. they can be used to gain and continue political support for the wider vision, and secure further funding towards achieving it. variate surveillance system can collect, analyse and interpret health-related information worldwide. such surveillance services require a sound and comprehensive spatial health data and information infrastructure to be built and maintained in a coherent way."}
