{"summary": "live-bird markets (LBMs) are the places where wild birds, pet birds, meat birds and domestic poultry are sold to households. in the markets, thousands of birds from different sources are sold in wire stacked cages containing densely packed and mixed bird populations. these conditions provide excellent environments for animal to animal and animal to human influenza virus transmissions. influenza A subtypes, H4N6 (n = 2) and H4N9 (n = 1), were isolated from healthy Muscovy ducks. co-infection of H4N6 and H4N9 in the same duck was also observed. two influenza A subtypes, H4N6 (CU-LM1983) and H4N9 (CU-LM1984) were isolated from oropharyngeal (CU-LM1983) and cloacal (CU-LM1984) swabs of the same duck. both H4 subtypes have never been reported in Thailand. phylogenetic analyses of the remaining 6 internal genes of the H4N6 and H4N9 influenza viruses were also conducted. results showed that all internal genes clustered in the Eurasian lineage, similar to both HA and NA genes. the phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining algorithm. the phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining algorithm. the phylogenetic tree was generated using 1000 replicates. CU-LM1984(N9) show only 38.1% nucleotide identity (64.6% amino acid identity) because of subtype differences. it is possible that the H4N9 virus has resulted from reassortment of the H4N6 backbone and the NA gene (N9) from a separate unknown HA influenza A virus subtype. gene position Virus with the highest percentage of nucleotide identity Genbank accession # % nucleotide identity PB2 55-2212 A/migratory duck/Hong Kong/MP206/2004(H5N2) EF597476.1 97% PB1 1-2265 A/mallard/Hokkaido/24/2009(H5N1) AB530990.1 98% PA 9-2133 A/environment/Dongting Lake/Hunan/3-9 the deduced amino acids at the HA cleavage site in the Thai H4N6 and H4N9 viruses are \"PEKASR\" the cleavage site pattern of both Thai H4N6 and H4N9 viruses indicates low pathogenic characteristics of influenza A viruses. the amino acids of Thai H4N6 and H4N9 at positions 224-229 and 134-138 were \"RGQSGR\" and \"GKSGA\" the receptor binding sites of H4N6 and H4N9 especially, Q226 and G228 are similar to all H4N6 in both Eurasian and North American lineages. one H4N6 virus from swine (A/Swine/Ontario/01911-1/99) contains amino acid 320-329 98 153 155 183 190 194 195 H4 position 338-343 110 165 167 196 203 207 208 A/Dk/TH/CU-LM1973/09 (H4N6) PEKASR Y W V H E L Y A/Dk/TH/CU-LM1983/09 (H4N6) PEKAPR Y W V H E L Y A/Dk/Czech/1/56 (H4N R A/Dk/TH/CU-LM1984/09 (H4N9) R G Q S G R A/Dk/Czech/1/56 (H4N6) R G Q S G R A/Muskrat/Buryatiya/1944/00 (H4N6) R G Q S G R A/mallard/Yan Chen/2005 (H4N6 R G Q S G R A/turnstone/NJ/47/85 (H4N the influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 and H4N9 found in LBMs can be a potential risk to birds and humans. the viruses were shed in feces and contaminated the wire stack cages in LBM. fortunately, the viruses circulating in this LBM are of low virulence. influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 and H4N9 were isolated from ducks. both H4N6 and H4N9 subtypes recovered from ducks had never been reported in Thailand. authors declare that they have no competing interests. this work has been funded in whole with federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institute of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. it is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH. we would like to thank the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT, Thailand) and the National Research University of CHE for grant support to AA."}
