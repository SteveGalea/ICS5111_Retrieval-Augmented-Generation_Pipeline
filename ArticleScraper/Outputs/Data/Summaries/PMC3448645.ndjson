{"summary": "s. epidermidis is the sister species of S. aureus. both of them produce biofilm to protect themselves from host immune system. the key component of the biofilm extracellular matrix in Staphylococci is polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) these structures revealed that MarR family proteins are all homodimers. the overall structure of each monomer could be divided into two functional domains, one is the dimerization domain and the other is the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domain. EMSA, CD, and Biacore experiments investigated the regulation mechanism of the binding ability of TcaR to ssDNA. a series of GC-rich and AT-rich ssDNA segments were designed to determine the type and length of the TcaR-binding site on ssDNA. EMSA analysis of TcaR suggests that TcaR prefers binding to the 33-mer ssDNA sequence with a molar ratio of 11. IcaR DNA1S and IcaR DNA1A are sense and antisense strand. EMSA analysis of binding of TcaR protein to dsDNA (IcaR DNA1) in the present of competitor from ssDNA(GC33) 1 M IcaR DNA1 probe duplex was pre-incubated with 1 M GC33 ssDNA fragment for 15 min at room temperature before mixing with TcaR protein of increasing concentration. ssDNA fragment size allows binding of ssDNA between 17 and 25-mer. the first one is complexed with dsDNA [13], [16], [22], [23], and the third is complexed with antibiotics [17]. the second case is complexed with salicylate [12], [17], [22], [23] and the third case is complexed with antibiotics. mers were mixed, and their interaction strengths with TcaR were compared using EMSA. findings indicated that increasing the concentration of TcaR produces a ssDNA band shift greater than that for dsDNA. to investigate possible pH effect of ssDNA binding activity of TcaR, a series of buffers with increasing pH were tested for their potential interfere in ssDNA binding. kanamycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin interfered with the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR at a concentration of 2 M. this effect was more pronounced at a higher concentration, suggesting that antibiotics inhibit formation of the TcaR-ssDNA complex. k d for the interaction of TcaR with the ssDNA GC33 is 9.5103 s1 (Table 1). To investigate whether TcaR binds to different types and different lengths of DNA molecules, Biacore experiment was used to test the binding of TcaR to DNA fragments of biotin-labeled ssDNA and hairpin DNA duplex (IcaR DNA1) the increase in RUs from the baseline was measured and used to calculate k a and k d. one RU represents binding of approximately 1 pg protein/mm2. sensograms represent binding of, from bottom to top: GC8, GC17, IcaR DNA1, AT33 and GC33. 1.6106 4.7 104 3.4109 4354 ssDNA (AT33) 8.1105 9.3103 8.7107 476 dsDNA (IcaR DNA1) 4.3105 5.0103 8.6107 268 Control dsDNA - - - a value obtained from k a divided by k d. results show not all MarR family proteins have this ssDNA binding ability, thus pointing to the specific ssDNA-binding feature of T CD spectra shows a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the negative peak at 222 and 210 nm. TcaR concentration was 25 M in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl. TcaR reduced the mobility of the M13 and X174 ssDNA. but S. epidermidis IcaR and S. aureus MarR family protein SAR2349 had no specific interactions with ssDNA. this indicated that TcaR has strong viral ssDNA-binding ability. EM images of negative controls in TcaR protein only (0.3 M) (B) and viral X174 ssDNA only (12 M) (C). a distinct group of DNA-binding proteins called the ssDNA-binding proteins could specifically bind ssDNA. in vitro and in vivo assay of Viron M13-ssDNA in absence or presence of TcaR protein. fluctuations in machine sensitivity were corrected by normalizing all data to the control. most reported antiphage systems have been shown to be relevant to the dsDNA phage, but not ssDNA, ssRNA, or dsRNA phages. the standard plaque assay was performed in E. coli as a model system since little is known about the ssDNA phage infecting Staphylococci. however, a TcaR-expressing strain did not demonstrate reduced sensitivity to dsDNA phage Lambda TcaR-ssDNA binding mode and minimal binding length were tested using EMSA. we used in vitro replication assay and plaque assay to elucidate the specific biological role of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR. EMSA analysis of mer ssDNA sequence with a molar ratio of 11. IcaR DNA1S and IcaR DNA1A are sense and antisense strands of IcaR DNA1 respectively. IcaR DNA1 probe duplex of 1 M was pre-incubated with 2 M TcaR (dimer) at room temperature for 15 min before mixing with increasing concentration of GC33 ssDNA. competition experiment carried out to compare binding strength of TcaR to ssDNA and to dsDNA. ssDNA fragment size to allow TcaR binding ranges between 17 and 25-mer. the first one is complexed with dsDNA [13], [16], [22] and the second is complexed with salicylate [12], [17], [22], [23]. the third case is complexed with antibiotics [17]. ssDNA band shift greater than that for dsDNA, confirming a stronger interaction between TcaR and ssDNA. a series of buffers with increasing pH were tested for their potential interfere in TcaR-ssDNA binding. a quadruple mutant failed to interact with either dsDNA or ssDNA. ssDNA binding activity of TcaR is pH-dependent. kanamycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin interfered with the ssDNA binding activity of TcaR at a concentration of 2 M. this effect was more pronounced at a higher concentration, suggesting that antibiotics inhibit formation of the TcaR-ssDNA complex. biacore experiment was used to test the binding of TcaR to DNA fragments of biotin-labeled ssDNA and hairpin DNA duplex (IcaR DNA1) TcaR binds to ssDNA GC33 and ssDNA AT33 with the higher affinity and the association rates of TcaR to IcaR DNA1 and ssDNA GC17, ranging from 4.3105 M1 s1 to 1.2105 M1 s1, are much lower k a and k d represent binding of approximately 1 pg protein/mm2. sensograms represent binding of, from bottom to top: GC8, GC17, IcaR DNA1, AT33 and GC33. 476 dsDNA (IcaR DNA1) 4.3105 5.0103 8.6107 268 Control dsDNA - - a K a value obtained from k a divided by k d. results show that not all MarR family proteins have this ssDNA binding ability, thus pointing to the specific ssDNA binding activity of TcaR. CD spectra of TcaR in various concentrations of GC33 and viral ssDNA X174 (varying from 0 to 125 M) TcaR concentration was 25 M in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 12.5% Glycerol, 10 mM DTT. marR family protein SAR2349 had no specific interactions with ssDNA. this indicated that TcaR has strong viral ssDNA-binding ability. other MarR family protein and TetR family protein do not have such ssDNA binding properties with high affinity. EM images of negative controls in TcaR protein only (0.3 M) (B) and viral X174 ssDNA only (12 M) (C). ssDNA-binding proteins (SBP) could specifically bind ssDNA and be used in processes where the double helix is separated. sensitivity of E. coli to each phage is represented as a histogram of the efficiency of plaquing. since 1980, investigators have developed an increasing number of bacteriophage therapies for the treatment, or prophylaxis, of bacterial infectious diseases. antiphage systems have been shown to be relevant to the dsDNA phage, but not ssDNA, ssRNA, or dsRNA phages. the standard plaque assay was performed in E. coli as a model system since little is known about the ssDNA phage infecting Staphylococci. however, a TcaR-expressing strain did not demonstrate reduced sensitivity to dsDNA phage Lambda (M we used in vitro replication assay and plaque assay to elucidate the specific biological role of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR. we used in vitro replication assay and plaque assay to elucidate the specific biological role of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR. eluted was dialyzed twice against 5 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM NaCl) and then subjected to Thrombin digestion to remove the tag. subsequently untagged SAR2349 protein was dialyzed twice against 3 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) 1 M of ssDNA or dsDNA were incubated with 1\u20134 M purified recombinant proteins under binding conditions (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EDTA, 12.5% Glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT and 1 mg/ml BSA) for 15 min at room temperature with gentle vortex. five fragments of 5\u2032 biotinylated oligonucleotides probes purified by PAGE were purchased from MDBio Inc. (Taiwan) Activation buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaOH) was injected for 1 min (20 l) to remove any unbound streptavidin from the sensor chip. the spectra were collected between 250 and 200 nm with 1 nm bandwidth. all spectra were obtained from an average of five scans. the photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V during the analysis. bio-transmission EM was performed with a Tecnai F20 Bio TWIN (FEI Co., Netherlands) using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. images were recorded with a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan MultiScanTM 600, USA) at a resolution of at least 4k4k pixels. cells were grown in LB media until optical density reached 0.6. pET-16b-TcaR protein was then induced by adding a final concentration of 0.1 mM IPTG. sensitivity of the host to phage infection was calculated as the efficiency of plaquing. cell-free extract was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column, which had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. his-tagged SAR2349 eluted was dialyzed twice against 5 liters of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM NaCl) and then subjected to Thrombin digestion to remove the tag. six oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA experiments were purchased from MDBio Inc.
