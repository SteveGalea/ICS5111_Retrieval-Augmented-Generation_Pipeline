{"summary": "in recent years, we have seen an increasing number of emerging virus disease outbreaks in human and animals alike with substantial health and economic impact. they are most likely related to accelerating environmental and anthropogenic changes, such as increased mobility and demographic changes. metagenomics assays rely on sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids from clinical samples. they allow detection of hundreds of viruses simultaneously and unknown viruses even if they are highly divergent from those already described. the fast discovery of a partial or full-length viral genome can serve as basis for development of specific molecular diagnostic assays to confirm suspect cases. significant problems in characterization of full-length viral genomes from metagenomic datasets are encountered when dealing with a highly divergent new virus with no closely related genomes in public databases. additional time-consuming experimental approaches are required to obtain full-length genome sequences. red bars: Percentage of reads of the metagenome assigned to target genome after genome finishing strategies were applied to the target genome. DRV, dolphin rhabdovirus; RFFRV, red fox fecal rhabdovirus; python nidovirus; PNV, python nidovirus. assembly of reads into long fragments, second assignment of at least one contig (seed) as originating from the target virus, third, linkage of other fragments to the seed contig to receive a draft genome and fourth, gap closing and finalizing of the draft genome to receive a full-length genome. assembly of all sequencing reads is necessary to shed light into population and functions within the metagenomic community. assembler was designed to work with uneven depth encountered in metagenomes. it has been tested for viral genome assembly in simulated viral metagenomes. if the genome sequence of the host is known, reads generated from the host can be subtracted prior to assembly by mapping which can increase virus contig lengths. a similar, iterative assembly approach is applied by IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler, Hunt et al., 2015), developed for RNA virus genomes with uneven sequencing depth. extensions are carried out more conservatively than with PRICE, leading to more accurate assemblies of HIV and Influenza sequencing samples. contigs were combined with fragments derived by other assembly methods to retrieve a full viral genome. a sequential assembly strategy for short-read data using an OLC and a de Bruijn graph assembler is also proposed by Deng et al. well-known examples are conserved motifs that act as mRNA start and poly(A)/stop site in viruses of the order Mononegavirales. other positive-strand RNA viruses synthesize subgenomic RNAs with similar or different mechanisms. a red fox fecal rhabdovirus was detected by detection of a highly conserved junctional motif. this motif was highly specific for the red fox fecal rhabdovirus genome. the motif was highly specific for the red fox fecal rhabdovirus genome. coverage profile binning can be applied in cases in which amplification is unnecessary or the introduction of a coverage bias was excluded. k-mer profiles are used in a wide range of sequence similarity searches in bioinformatics. ranking of k-mer profiles, based on their similarity to seed contig, was successfully used to link fragments of two rhabdovirus genomes. other applications of k-mer analysis in viral metagenomes include nucleotide composition analysis. information on adjacency of contigs can be found in such graphs. this method has successfully been applied when sequencing the gram-negative bacteria Rickettsia prowazekii. well-known examples are the conserved motifs that act as mRNA start and poly(A)/stop site in viruses of the order Mononegavirales. the existence of sequence motifs in mononegavirales and Nidovirales could provide an ideal target for motif search and detection strategies for linkage of fragments. also viruses with segmented genomes, like Influenza A, have been shown to harbor conserved sequence motifs. coverage profile binning was used to assemble viral genomes across different human gut metagenomes avoiding the use of reference strains. coverage profile binning can be applied in cases in which amplification is unnecessary or the introduction of a coverage bias was excluded. k-mer analysis allows to overcome data analysis challenges associated with growing data volumes and short read lengths. sensitivity of taxonomic classification for viral metagenome datasets does not reach the de facto gold standard level of tBLASTX analyses. sensitivity of taxonomic classification for viral metagenome datasets is limited by quality and comprehensiveness of reference data set. a k-mer profile contains frequency information on 4 k (256, in case of 4-mers) k-mers. other methods for linkage of fragments If sequence similarity of a part of the viral target genomes to sequences in the databases is low, it is sometimes still possible to apply remote homology detection methods. contig ends can be the reason that no further overlap has been found by an assembler. editing of contig ends improves wrong assemblies and facilitates subsequent gap closing with a different assembler. combination of different assemblies of the data can help to close potential gaps and confirm the sequences. this was the case for the genome of a python nidovirus (PNV, Bodewes et al., 2014a; Smits et al., 2014a; Smits et al., 2014) which had an unresolvable 5\u2032 end and the PNV genome putatively lacks some genome information there. another next-generation sequencing platform could be used to confirm the findings of the 454 data. author contributions RB and SS conceived the study.
