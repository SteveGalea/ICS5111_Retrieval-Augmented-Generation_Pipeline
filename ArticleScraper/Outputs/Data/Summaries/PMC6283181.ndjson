{"summary": "the field of evolutionary virology was inaugurated with two key papers that shaped the way virus evolution was studied in subsequent decades. the first was an experimental study by Domingo and colleagues that showed individual populations of RNA viruses carried abundant genetic variation. the second, by Palese and co-workers, considered variants of human influenza virus sampled from different patients to reveal the nature of genetic differences between RNA viruses at the interhost, epidemiological scale. the defining theme of this field is the idea that the exceptionally high mutation rate in RNA viruses means that they evolve according to a form of group selection known as the \u201cquasispecies\u201d. the quasispecies concept has become so widely adopted that it is often cited whenever genetic variation is encountered in a viral population, and has even been used in nonviral systems. RNA viruses are important model \u201corganisms\u201d capable of advancing our understanding of the evolutionary process. RNA viruses are characterized by the generation and fixation of mutations over time periods amenable to direct human observation. RNA viruses provide a useful natural laboratory to visualize evolutionary processes in real time. poliovirus has been one of the mainstays of experimental approaches to studying viral evolution. evolution may not always reflect that in nature and it is mistaken to think that it is representative of all viruses. there is a similar danger in generalizing results from experimental systems that do not reflect the natural host range of the virus. phylogenetic analyses are limited by the availability of samples to inform on evolutionary patterns and processes. phylogenetic analyses are also limited by the availability of samples to inform on evolutionary patterns and processes. phylogenetic analysis may sometimes be better used as a means to generate hypotheses that can then be tested experimentally. from 102 to 105 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (Duffy et al. 2008; Sanju\u00e1n 2012; Holmes et al. 2016). despite increasing accuracy of measures of mutation rate, truly slowly evolving RNA viruses have yet to be identified. high rates of background mutation have obvious consequences for virus evolution. deep sequencing studies of intrahost virus genetic diversity have revealed that most mutation variants present within a single host are present at low frequency, are short-lived, and are usually found only at a single sampling time point. it is possible that the very large intrahost population sizes of RNA viruses can be in the order of 1010 virions at any single time point. evolution has important implications for the accuracy of the molecular clock dating of RNA viruses. the inclusion of multiple sequences sampled within single disease outbreaks may result in an underestimation of times to common ancestry of specific viruses as a whole (long-term) the quasispecies consider evolutionary behavior in RNA systems characterized by very high mutation rates. quasispecies theory was developed by Manfred Eigen as a model of self-replicating macromolecules theoretically equivalent to those that characterized life\u2019s early evolution. it has been defined as the \u201cdistribution of mutants that belong to the maximum eigenvalue of the system\u201d. a high-fitness clone evolved to lower mean fitness because its mutational neighbors were of low fitness. this has been termed the \u201csurvival of the flattest\u201d (Wilke et al. 2001), although it is more correctly thought of as increased mutational robustness. experimental studies have shown that viral populations can experience the form of group selection implied in quasispecies theory. there is currently little evidence that this applies to viruses outside of the laboratory. however, there is little definitive evidence for quasispecies dynamics. human H3N2 influenza A virus carries two different amino acid variants at a specific site in the neuraminidase protein that together increase fitness in cell culture compared to when these amino acids occur singly. this likely reflects the impact of major virus population bottlenecks both within and between hosts. the science of molecular epidemiology has arguably been the most successful way in which evolutionary ideas have permeated into virology. phylogenetic studies are especially important whenever a novel virus emerges. phylogenetic approaches can help reveal patterns, processes, and rates of cross-species transmission (i.e., host jumping) in viruses. phylogenetic methods can also be used to provide estimates of evolutionary rates and the timescale over which viral evolution has occurred. a range of epidemiological parameters can be estimated from genomic data, including the basic reproductive number, R0 (the number of secondary infections caused by a single host in an entirely susceptible population) these methods combined with new wealth of genome sequence data have led to a blossoming of the field of \u201cphylodynamics\u201d. phylogenies can only link geographic locations from which virus sequences have been sampled, which may not necessarily reflect the exact migration pathways of the virus. phylogenies can only link geographic locations from which virus sequences have been sampled, which may not necessarily reflect the exact migration pathways. phylogenies map traits like virulence and host range that are central to understanding disease emergence. mutations that fall at deeper nodes are more likely to be selectively advantageous, such as the A82V mutation in the glycoprotein of Ebola virus that seemingly increases replication in human cells. reassortment appears to be an almost obligatory part of the replication. the most striking examples of the latter are those with single-strand negative-sense genomes arranged as a single RNA molecule. the evolution of RNA virus recombination has been treated in the same manner as the evolution of sex. a fortuitous by-product of this was segmental reassortment following the mixed infection of single cells. the existence of \u201cmulticomponent\u201d viruses seems too convoluted an arrangement to evolve as a means of facilitating reassortment. recombination/reassortment may involve selection for reasons other than the generation of genetic diversity. 1% of the total universe of viruses, i.e., the virosphere, has been sampled. this necessarily means that our understanding of RNA virus evolution is based on a tiny, and profoundly biased subset of virus diversity. this necessarily means that our understanding of RNA virus evolution is based on a tiny, and profoundly biased, subset of virus diversity. single-stranded DNA viruses experience rates of evolutionary change relatively close to those seen in some RNA viruses. the vast increase in sampling promised by metagenomics offers the chance to test these theories with empirical data. metagenomics will eventually document the existence of viruses in hosts that have not been regularly screened for RNA viruses. the study of virus evolution has made major advances over the last 40 years. modern sequencing technologies enable us to describe the extent and pattern of virus genetic variation within and between hosts with remarkable speed and accuracy. the real-time sequencing of thousands of virus genomes during disease outbreaks can now be considered routine. despite the huge amount of viral genome sequence data now generated, there remains an important disconnect between evolution within individual hosts and evolution at the epidemiological scale. despite the huge amount of viral genome sequence data now generated and our increasing knowledge of the fitness of individual mutations, there remains an important disconnect between evolution within individual hosts and evolution at the epidemiological scale. a new framework for studying RNA virus evolution must therefore find consilience between research at the intra- and interhost scales. evolutionary genetics is central to bridging this gap because the issue of interest is how genetic diversity is generated and maintained within and among hosts."}
