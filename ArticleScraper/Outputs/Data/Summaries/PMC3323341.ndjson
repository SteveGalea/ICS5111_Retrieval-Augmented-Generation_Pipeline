{"summary": "a slightly different model was used to quantify the role that fast diagnosis and efficient isolation of patients played in the outbreak. this model predicted control in Toronto and showed that lack of immediate action would have been catastrophic (11). the basic reproductive number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case. if R0 1, an epidemic can not be sustained. on the other hand, if R0 > 1, an epidemic typically occurs. the model parameters = (, l) are fitted to Hong Kong data (2) by least squares fit to the cumulative number of cases C (t, ) (equation 1 in reference 10) all other parameters are fixed to their baseline values. the best fit gives = 0.25 and l = 0.43. most of the SARS cases included in the epidemiologic studies of the Toronto outbreak (5) were transmitted in hospitals limits the use of general demographic data from Toronto in the estimation of and p. we used an uncertainty analysis on the basic reproductive number (R0) to assess the variability in R0 that results from the uncertainty in the model parameters. sensitivity analysis for l was performed to quantify the effect of changes in the model parameters on R0. partial rank correlation coefficients (12\u201315) were computed between each of the parameters (with the exception of p, q, and, which were held fixed) and R0 as samples were drawn from the distributions. the transmission rate () is defined as the number of persons infected per infectious person per day. this differs from R0, which is the average number of secondary cases an infectious person generates when introduced into a susceptible population. the basic reproductive number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases an infectious individual can generate when this rate is introduced into a susceptible population. we used a computer program and appropriate initial conditions for the parameters. the best fit gives = 0.25 and l = 0.43. the best fit gives = 0.25 and l = 0.43. we used a Monte Carlo procedure (simple random sampling) to quantify the uncertainty of R0 to model parameters when these parameters are distributed. a probability density function for R0 is obtained and can be statistically characterized. distributions of l used for the Monte Carlo calculation of the partial rank correlation coefficients are: a) l (a = 2, b = 2) where is used to denote a beta distribution. probability of l decreases linearly in the [0,1] interval. 25% of the weight of the distribution of R0 lies at R0 > 1. the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the distribution of the basic reproductive number (R0) of SARS is larger when p = 1. all other parameters in equation 1 were fixed to their baseline values. l = 0 denotes perfect isolation while l = 1 denotes no isolation. transmission rate and relative infectivity during isolation are the most influential parameters in determining R0. probability distribution Input parameters in order of decreasing PRCC (a = 2, b = 2) (0.92), l (0.57), (0.53), 2 (0.35), (0.32), k (0.13) (a = 1, b = 2) (0.90), l (0.60), (0.44), (0.39), 2 (0.26), k (0.12) (a = 2, b = 1) (0.92), (0.60), l (0.51), 2 (0.40), (0.22) the distribution for the case of perfect isolation (l = 0, a = 0.369, b = 0.473, c = 0.756) is shown as a reference. l = 0 denotes perfect isolation; l = 1 denotes no isolation. our results do not change if we assume the three distributions mentioned in the Methods section (sensitivity analysis) for the parameter l. the relative infectiousness after isolation is ranked second when l comes from distributions (a) and (b) and ranked third when it comes from distribution (c) our estimates for R0 agree with the empirical R0 observed from the data of the first week of the SARS outbreak in Singapore (8). a stretched exponential distribution fits the resulting distributions of R0 for the different locations. implementing a single method for control may not be sufficient to contain a SARS outbreak. we cannot ignore or minimize the value of stringent quarantine measures and the probability of compliance combined with the economic effect of lost wages. we cannot ignore or minimize the value of stringent quarantine measures and the probability of compliance combined with the economic effect of lost wages. the sensitivity index is where the 10 normalized sensitivity indexes are with = p(1\u2013)+ and 2 = a 1/( \u20131) for the parameters used in this model, the sensitivity indexes, p, q, and l are positive, k = \u2013q, and the remaining indexes are negative. sensitivity indices and the associated percentage changes needed to affect a 1% decrease in R0 are given in Tables A1 and A2. l is going from 0.43 to 0.42 isolation effectiveness,2 results in a 1% decrease in R0. the most effective way to reduce R0 is to decrease the transmission rate and the parameter l (improve the effective isolation rate) in the case of Toronto, = \u20130.4758 means that a 2.1% increase in, results in a 1% decrease in R0. a mixed strategy should be formulated that maximizes the effectiveness of a combined intervention. if x denotes the magnitude of percentage decrease in l, then the total additional cost of a new mixed isolation and diagnosis intervention policy must satisfy the inequality CIx+CDy CT. the sensitivity index is where the 10 normalized sensitivity indexes are with = p(1\u2013)+ and 2 = a 1/( \u20131) for the parameters used in this model, the sensitivity indexes, p, q, and l are positive, k = \u2013q, and the remaining indexes are negative. sensitivity indices and the associated percentage changes needed to affect a 1% decrease in R0 are given in Tables A1 and A2. value of l, that is going from 0.43 to 0.42 isolation effectiveness,2 results in approximately a 1% decrease in R0. the most effective way to reduce R0 is to decrease the transmission rate and the parameter l (improve the effective isolation rate) in the case of Toronto, = \u20130.4758 means that a 2.1% increase in, results in a 1% decrease in R0. isolation and diagnosis have associated 1% incremental costs in implementation of CI and CD. if x denotes the magnitude of percentage decrease in l, then the total additional cost of a combined intervention policy must satisfy the inequality CIx+CDy CT."}
