{"summary": "a total of 458 confirmed cases with 177 deaths in china had been reported by December 2014. the virus has reemerged since November 2013, resulting in the second outbreak in china. this novel influenza virus can bind to both avian and human receptors. a surveillance study has suggested that the novel influenza A H7N9 virus is a new reassortant of several influenza viruses. this is because the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of influenza viruses may be a promising target for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. this is because M2e is relatively conserved in different subtypes of influenza virus. peptides encoding the M2e of A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1), A/Anhui/01(H7N9) and A/Hong Kong/156/97 (Figure 1) were synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China) each rectangle represents a copy of M2e. two groups of mice (15 mice/group) were subcutaneously (s.c.) vaccinated with H5N1-M2e tetramer peptide pre-mixed, respectively, with Freund's adjuvant (FA, Sigma, St. Louis, SO, USA) and the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) as described previously. three other groups of mice (15 mice/group) were s.c. injected with FA, SAS or phosphate-buff horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 1 h. substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 1 h. ate was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) the viral RNA copy numbers were determined using a lightcycler 96 (Roche Applied science, Penzberg, Germany) primers specific for influenza viral M gene (forward primer: 5-CTT CTA ACC GAG GTC GAA ACG-3; reverse primer: 5-GGC ATT TTG GAC AAA KCG TCT A-3) were used in the QRT-PCR assay. mice were kept in cages and sterilized food and water in the animal facility. the animal study was approved by the Committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research. er was detected by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. the 50% lethal dose (LD50) was determined by challenging mice with serial dilutions of the virus. all experiments involving H7N9 virus were performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities as described previously. a 96-well micro-titer plate (Sigma, St. Louis, SO, USA) was coated with either H5N1\u2013, H7N9\u2013 or HK/156-M2e (GL Biochem Ltd, Shanghai, China) at a concentration of 1 g/well. serially diluted sera were added to the plate and incubated at RT for 2 h. viral RNA copies in mouse lung homogenates were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) the extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a lightcycler 96 (Roche Applied science, Penzberg, Germany) primers specific for influenza viral M gene were used in the QRT-PCR assay. a difference of five amino acids was observed between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e. a difference of five amino acids was observed between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e. the predicted model with the highest score was chosen for discussion purposes. a difference of 21% (5/24) amino acids was identified between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e. mice were vaccinated three times with tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide mixed with FA (H5N1M2e+FA) or SAS (H5N1M2e+SAS) vaccination of H5N1-M2e with either FA or SAS could protect 80% (8/10) of mice from lethal challenge of H7N9 virus. 1 out of 10 mice vaccinated with FA also survived the lethal challenge (survival rate 10%) H5N1-M2e+FA- and H5N1M2e+SAS-vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of influenza virus. FA, SAS, and PBS alone were used as negative controls. survival of mice (10/group) was observed for 21-day post-challenge. ted mice included damage to the bronchial epithelium with denatured pneumocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. ted mice included damage to the bronchial epithelium with denatured pneumocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. ted mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of A/Anhui/01/2013. compared the structural differences between the predicted 3D models. all four M2e peptides were folded as hairpin shapes. the structural differences might be due to properties of substituted amino acids. a difference of five amino acids was observed between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e. a difference of approximately 21% (5/24) amino acids was identified between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e. a difference of 5 amino acids was observed between the sequences of H5N1-M2e. e and H7N9-M2e were vaccinated three times with tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide mixed with FA (H5N1M2e+FA) or SAS. Mice sera were sampled 21 days after priming and 10 days after second booster vaccination for the ELISA detection. the titer of HK/156-M2e cross-reactive antibody was approximately 2 logs lower than that of H7N9-M2e (P 0.05) vaccination of H5N1-M2e with either FA or SAS could protect 80% (8/10) of mice from lethal challenge of H7N9 virus. N1M2e+SAS-vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of influenza virus. FA, SAS, and PBS alone were used as negative controls. survival of mice (10/group) was observed for 21-day post-challenge. mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) 10 days after the second booster vaccination. the virus titers in the lungs were determined by (A) TCID50 assay and (B) QRT-PCR. all four M2e were folded as hairpin shapes. the structural differences between these four M2e peptides might be due to the properties of substituted amino acids. current efforts to develop universal vaccines include the development of M2e-based vaccines, HA stem vaccines 29 and M1 VLPs. no existing vaccines can provide effective cross-protection against a mutated or reassorted novel influenza virus. the cross-protection of the vaccination was directly attributed to the levels of cross-reactive antibodies toward the M2e of challenge viruses. the vaccine can provide satisfactory cross-protection against infection by homogenous viruses but poor cross-protection against infection by heterogeneous viruses. 3D structures of M2e-A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1), M2e-A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1), M2e-A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9), and M2e-A/Beijing/501/09 (H1N1) were analyzed using the online software PEP-FOLD. the 3D structures of M2e-A/Vietnam/1194/04 a slight protection (10% survival) was observed in mice vaccinated with FA alone. the survival rate of the mice vaccinated with H5N1-M2e plus FA was significantly higher than that of the mice vaccinated with FA alone (P 0.01) complete protection has been reported in the combined use of an M2e vaccine and inactivated virus vaccine."}
