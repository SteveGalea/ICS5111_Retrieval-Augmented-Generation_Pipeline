{"summary": "important regulators of this process are the B cell lymphoma 2 family of proteins. anti-apoptotic members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), whereas pro-apoptotic members include Bax-like proteins, such as Bax, Bak, and Bok. Mcl-1 overex-pression has been reported in breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical and ovarian cancers,13 and leukemia. in vitro inhibition of Mcl-1 overexpression through RNA silencing inhibits tumor growth16 and abolishes chemoresistance. to assist virtual screening, several studies have used structural ensembles obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) this approach has led to experimentally validated predictions. 26,27 Thus, NMR, MD, and NMA have each been used separately to improve virtual screening. default values of DQMIN -100 and DQMAX 100 were used. for both STAND and ElN\u00e9mo, only the three non-trivial lowest frequency modes were calculated. for each of these three modes, six PDB models were generated by STAND. clustering is a means of partitioning data so that data points inside a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to points outside a cluster. one common distance metric is coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD) one centroid conformation PDB structure was chosen for subsequent molecular docking. model 1 of the NMR structure of PDB ID 2MHS,28 model 1 was used as a starting structure. we picked the 1,000 ligands with the lowest binding energies and docked them on the multiple conformations sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD. the maximum number of binding modes to generate was 9. default values of deformation amplitude were used. for both STAND and ElN\u00e9mo, only the three non-trivial lowest frequency modes were calculated. for each of these modes, six PDB models were generated by STAND. clustering is a means of partitioning data so that data points inside a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to points outside a cluster. one common distance metric is coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD) autoDock calculation was performed on a representative structure of the NMR ensemble. we picked the 1,000 ligands with the lowest binding energies and docked them on multiple conformations sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD. in all cases, the maximum number of binding modes to generate was 9. the ligands were virtually docked to the multiple Mcl-1 conformations calculated herein using AutoDock Vina. they displayed predicted attractive (negative) binding energies in order: 4.97 Kcal/mol (3WIX), 4.86 Kcal/mol (4HW3), 4.82 Kcal/mol (4ZBI), 4.74 Kcal/mol (4ZBF), 2.95 Kcal/mol (5FDO), 0.5 Kcal/mol (ABT-737). molecule, ABT-737, does not bind to Mcl-1, provided a positive repulsive energy. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of the predicted and observed binding energy is 0.90. from these, the top 1,000 ligands with the lowest binding energy were selected for a more thorough screening using multiple conformations sampled by NMR, NMA, and MD. the top 10 lead-like molecules are ranked according to their average binding energy. the three conformations give diverse top 10 ranked compounds. the top 10 ligands with the lowest binding energies in the NMR conformation ensemble are ZINC069 09626, ZINC04529774, ZINC00134139, ZINC01668172, ZINC71890788, ZINC69705019, ZINC05500896, ZINC08405446, ZINC06507008, and ZINC95467634. the only information provided by the lead-like molecules is the general skeleton that seems to be common to most Mcl-1 inhibitors to date. virtual docking of the 1,790 drugs approved by the FDA took 300 hours, on the NMA distorted models took 150 hours, and on the MD simulated models 80 hours. the top 10 ligands with the lowest average binding energies in the NMR conformation ensemble are exemestane, levorphanol, cyproheptadine, dextromethorphan, epinastine, lenvatinib, sibutramine, oxcarbazepine, mirtazapine, and darifenacin. each conformation ensemble gives rise to binding site perturbations and binds different ligand exemestane is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor administered in breast cancer. lenvatinib is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 kinase inhibitor administered in thyroid cancer. exemestane and lenvatinib are favorable candidates for Mcl-1-targeted cancer therapies. nilotinib is a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid cell leukemia. nilotinib is currently undergoing clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel. cabergoline is an ergot derivative and a potent D2 dopamine receptor agonist used in the treatment of prolactinomas and uterine fibroids. it contains a tricyclic ring structurally related to the pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, S1,37,38 a Bcl-2 family inhibitor that binds to Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with nanomolar affinity, disrupts Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis, the top 10 ligands with the lowest average binding energies in the MD simulated conformation ensemble are azelastine, florbetapir, nebivolol, lenalidomide, dolasetron, droperidol, torsemide, mazindol, deferasirox, and thalidomide (magenta) the potential ligands are shown in the Mcl-1-binding site and are colored as dolasetron is a serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonist used against nausea. droperidol is a catecholamine reuptake inhibitor and a central nervous system stimulant. trazodone is a serotonergic antagonist and reuptake inhibitor. nebivolol is a 1-adrenergic receptor blocker with significant dopaminergic pharmacology. ligands with high standard deviations are highly flexible. the more conformations a ligand may adopt, the more receptor poses are possible. the more conformations a ligand may adopt, the more receptor poses are possible. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.54 makes sense in light of the diverging paths of the NMA and MD conformations from the original NMR structure. the MD models with an RMSD of 1.34 cover a larger area of the conformational space of Mcl-1 than on their own. the ligands displayed predicted attractive (negative) binding energies. the ligands were ranked in accordance with their experimental binding constants. the small molecule, ABT-737, provided a positive repulsive energy. virtual docking of the top 1,000 ligands on the MD simulated models of Mcl-1 took 200 hours. binding site on Mcl-1 was defined and limited by a box measuring 16, 18, and 20. 172 (6.8) ZINC65514802 (8.25) ZINC01668172 (6.85) 5 ZINC71890788 (6.75) ZINC42777654 (8.18) ZINC02673507 (6.78) 6 ZINC69705019 (6.65) ZINC78946317 (8.11) ZINC48345734 (6.73) 7 ZINC05500896 (6.64) ZINC33257600 (8.11) ZINC marinopyrrole A is structurally related to the indole-2-carboxylic acid 33 (PDB ID 4HW2) that was a potent inhibitor of Mcl-1. the lead-like molecules often display nitrogen in the hydrocarbon chain and in the polycyclic aromatic rings. the lead-like molecules also risk suffering from toxicity and metabolic instability. conformations 1 Exemestane (6.13) Nilotinib (6.43) 2 Levorphanol (6.1) Ergotamine (7.30) 3 Cyproheptadine (6.04) Miltefosine (7.57) Lenalidomide (6.23) 4 Dextromethorphan (6.03) Deferasirox (7.53) Dolasetron (6.18) 5 Epinastine (6.01) Lurasidone (7.47) Torsemide (6.13) the potential ligands are shown in the Mcl-1-binding site. each conformation ensemble gives rise to binding site perturbations. exemestane and lenvatinib are clinically used and approved. the top 10 ligands with the lowest binding energies in the NMA conformation ensemble are nilotinib (7.65), ergotamine (7.6), miltefosine (7.57), deferasirox (7.53), lurasidone (7.47), eltrombopag (7.38), paliperidone (7.35), adapalene (7.35), cabergoline (7.23), and ris nilotinib is a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid cell leukemia. nilotinib is currently undergoing clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of relapsed solid tumors. the top 10 ligands are azelastine, florbetapir, nebivolol, lenalidomide, dolasetron, droperidol, torsemide, mazindol, deferasirox, and thalidomide. of the top 10 drugs, four are atypical antipsychotics. torsemide (brown), mazindol (green), deferasirox (light pink) and thalidomide (magenta) are structural analogs of the rhodanine derivative, BH3I-1, developed by Degterev et al,48. at least three of the top 10 drugs have dopaminergic and serotonergic activity. torsemide shares structural similarity with benzyl-sulfonyl-amide moiety. it mandates experimental investigation for its role as an Mcl-1 inhibitor. the standard deviation characterizes the variation from the average ligand binding energy to 20 NMR, four MD, and six NMA conformations. each axis enumerates the drug rank in the three conformation families. each point represents one of the 1,790 FDA-approved drugs. top ranking drugs are colored red, bottom ranking drugs are colored blue. this study postulates an additional target for some FDA-approved drugs. if a drug is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer, then the clinical use of the potential Mcl-1 inhibitors could be very promising. serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and histamine regulate cell proliferation, migration, maturation, and apoptosis in a variety of cell types. some of the potential Mcl-1 ligands presented here are serotonergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic modulators (ie, ergotamine, paliperidone, lurasidone, and risperidone) some of these drugs are already undergoing clinical trials ligand binding energies (G) are predicted in kcal/mol. the individual value of a ligand\u2019s binding energy is less informative than the binding energy relative to other ligands. dopamine, histamine, and Mcl-1 modulation are associated. such a coincidence is further supported by the vicious cycle of depression, anxiety, and cancer."}
