{"summary": "adenovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus are known to possess an ocular tropism. adenoviruses and subtype H7 influenza viruses are known to possess an ocular tropism, but documented human ocular disease has been reported following infection with all principal respiratory viruses. principal respiratory viruses known to cause ocular disease in humans Virus Subtype(s)a Tropism in humans Ocular disease in humans Reference(s) Adenovirus Species D Ocular Frequently associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 5\u20137 Species B, C, E Respiratory Occasional simple acute follicular conjunctivitis. the nasolacrimal system provides an anatomical bridge between ocular and respiratory tissues. the lacrimal duct collects tear fluid from the ocular surface and transports it to the inferior meatus of the nose. absorption of tear fluid through the epithelial lining of the lacrimal duct is also possible (29). this allows drainage of immunizing agents to nasal tissue following topical ocular administration. despite presence of antimicrobial peptides present in tear film, numerous viral agents have been detected in the tear fluid of symptomatic, chronic, and asymptomatic individuals (4, 32\u201336), underscoring the potential for ocular involvement following respiratory virus infection. linked SA have been detected on epithelial and goblet cells of the lacrimal duct. 2-3-linked SA are restricted to epithelial cells. the composition of internal sugars of the glycan receptor can also influence receptor specificity. in-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, on cardiac and pulmonary tissue likely contributes to the severe respiratory disease associated with this virus (48\u201350) further research is needed to better understand the contribution of sialylated ocular mucins to host defense of these pathogens. the development of continuous ocular cell lines and the use of primary human ocular cell types have provided researchers the opportunity not only to study the permissiveness of discrete locations within the human eye to respiratory virus infection. in vitro and in vivo models allow for the coincident study of multiple anatomical locations following viral infection, providing greater insight into the capacity for virus to disseminate. mice used extensively to study herpesvirus keratitis have been adapted to study ocular complications from numerous viral respiratory diseases. the rabbit has long been used for the assessment of eye irritation and has since been utilized to study ocular disease following respiratory virus infection. za virus (H1N1, H3N2) Dropwise onto corneal surface Ocular, respiratory, intestinal tract tissue Comparable to intranasal inoculation 26 Rabbit Adenovirus (species C) Intrastromal inoculation followed by scarification and topical administration Ocular Subepithelial corneal infiltrates similar to EKC in humans 73\u201375 Cotton rat Adenovirus (species C and D) Intrastromal inoculation followed human disease with species D adenoviruses has often been associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), a highly contagious and severe ocular disease, which can progress to hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (5, 6). ocular disease has been documented following human infection with over half of all identified adenovirus serotypes. the human eye are permissive to adenovirus infection, including corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells and corneal stromal fibroblasts (75, 92\u201395) the human eye are permissive to adenovirus infection, including corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells and corneal stromal fibroblasts (75, 92\u201395) cular Ad37 inoculation recapitulate many ocular immunopathologic features present in human Ad37 keratitis. these small-mammal models have proven useful in the evaluation of numerous potential antiviral and other therapeutic agents against ocular adenovirus infection. there is currently only limited virus-specific therapy and no vaccine available for adenovirus-caused ocular disease. select H7 viruses have been associated with concurrent ocular and respiratory disease in humans. many H7 influenza viruses have been found to be partially adapted to recognize 2-6-linked sialic acids. ocular complications have been documented following human infection with influenza virus subtypes that are more commonly associated with respiratory illness. human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells support the productive replication of select influenza viruses. retinal pigment epithelial cells and trabecular meshwork cells support the productive replication of select influenza viruses. avian H5 and H7 influenza viruses replicate more efficiently and to higher titers in these cells than human and swine influenza viruses (55, 123). the eye and surrounding conjunctiva represent a permissive port of entry for all influenza virus subtypes. the eye and surrounding conjunctiva represent a permissive port of entry for all influenza virus subtypes. ocular tissue is a portal of entry for RSV (15) ocular inflammation demonstrated experimentally the ability of this virus to use the eye as a gateway to mount a respiratory infection. bovine and sheep isolates of RSV have caused conjunctivitis with mild respiratory disease in lambs and cattle (132\u2013135) measles is a major public health problem in developing countries. it is responsible for approximately 139,000 deaths annually. corneal ulcerations often follow measles infections in malnourished children. HCoV isolates are highly transmissible and are a frequent cause of common colds in all age groups (1). conjunctivitis has been reported in select cases (17, 18, 166, 167) a definitive link of HCoV-NL63 as etiologic agent of this disease has not been established. despite inconclusive evidence of SARS coronavirus replication in ocular samples, these studies underscore the eye as a potential portal of entry for this virus. ocular complications are not a frequent manifestation of coronavirus infections in humans. most typical symptoms from rhinovirus infection in humans include runny nose, congestion, sore throat, chills, and fever. initiation occurs following deposition of virus in the nose or eye and transport of virus by mucociliary transport to the back of the throat. reports of rhinovirus replication in conjunctival tissue itself have been rare but documented. serotypes EV11 and EV19 were responsible for outbreaks of enterovirus uveitis in infants. many of these viruses utilize 2-3-linked SA as a cellular receptor (37), warranting closer examination to determine if human ocular tissue represents a permissive cell type for these viruses. all identified adenovirus serotypes have come from in vitro studies using human ocular cell types. many regions of the human eye are permissive to adenovirus infection, including corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells and corneal stromal fibroblasts. ocular inoculation of cotton rats with Ad5 or Ad8 results in a course of disease generally similar to that of human infection with these serotypes (78). mice have recapitulate many ocular immunopathologic features present in human Ad37 keratitis and have furthered our understanding of immunological mediators via the use of knockout mice. the great majority of human infections with avian and human influenza A viruses result in respiratory disease, but additional symptoms have been documented. ocular and gastrointestinal complications have been documented (104) ocular complications have been documented. a recent study demonstrated transocular spread of influenza virus vaccine to nasopharynx tissue in experimentally exposed individuals (121). these reports illustrate the ability of a diverse range of influenza A viruses to use the eye as a portal of entry in the absence of a recognized tropism for this tissue. in vitro and ex vivo studies have been conducted to examine the permissiveness of ocular cell types to influenza virus infection. ferrets mount a productive respiratory virus infection following ocular inoculation with both avian and human influenza viruses. conjunctivitis has been reported following experimental inoculation of dogs and mice with H5N1 virus and of ferrets with H7N3 virus (72, 125) in vitro and in vivo studies have advanced our understanding of the role of RSV in ocular disease. human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells are permissive to RSV infection. ocular tissue is a portal of entry for RSV (15) avian pneumoviruses frequently cause both respiratory and ocular disease in turkeys. measles virus causes a febrile rash illness that is accompanied by cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (143) measles is effectively controlled by vaccination programs in many countries. rubella virus is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. it can infect cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract and is a major cause of pediatric respiratory disease worldwide. infection can occur following respiratory or ocular exposure. bovine and sheep isolates of RSV have caused conjunctivitis with mild respiratory disease in lambs and cattle. hMPV is second only to RSV as the causative agent of acute pediatric respiratory disease (138, 139) clinical manifestations of hMPV disease typically range from mild respiratory disease to pneumonia. measles-rubella vaccine is now used worldwide, so the same vaccine is used to protect children from measles. rubella virus, a member of the family togavirus, causes a relatively mild disease in children and adults. rubella can lead to deafness, heart disease, and cataracts. HCoV-NL63 is a viral pneumonia capable of rapid progression to severe disease and death (19, 169) it is unclear if the presentation of conjunctivitis in HCoV-NL63-infected patients is attributed to the coronavirus itself or rather represents a manifestation of disease caused by an unrelated pathogen or disease. studies could not detect SARS coronavirus in tears and conjunctival scraping samples collected from confirmed SARS patients. despite inconclusive evidence of SARS coronavirus replication in ocular samples, these studies underscore the eye as a potential portal of entry for this virus. studies have shown that experimental inoculation of virus into the conjunctiva results in human rhinovirus infection, likely due to the spread of the virus inoculum to the nose via the nasolacrimal duct. report of rhinovirus replication in conjunctival tissue itself have been rare but documented and were not associated with a particular virus serotype (20) the human parainfluenza viruses have been detected in conjunctival cells isolated from patients with conjunctivitis and from nasal swabs collected from children presenting with conjunctivitis. avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 is a potentially lethal virus primarily in poultry (192) but inadvertent human exposure has resulted in transient conjunctivitis. ovirus infection of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells provide insight into potential shared mechanisms of inflammation following virus infection. shared protocols for virus inoculation, tissue harvesting, and sample manipulation underscore the ability to use advances from research with other respiratory pathogens with ocular complications. future research evaluating efficacy of existing vaccines and antivirals against respiratory viruses will better address these questions. the studies described in this review support recommendations which advise for the benefit of wearing eye protection during potential exposure to respiratory pathogens."}
