{"summary": "angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and insulin/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) show cardioprotective effects after acute MI. Arg972 IRS-1 polymorphism is associated with diminished activity of insulin. Arg972 IRS-1 polymorphism is associated with diminished activity of insulin. ACE2 metabolizes angiotensin (Ang) I to form Ang II, which is of key importance in the pathophysiology of the Ang system. ACE2 is present in the heart, and a reduction in its expression is associated with enhanced cardiac hypertrophy and reduced pumping ability. a common polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene, the Arg972 IRS-1 polymorphism, is associated with impaired IRS-1 ability to activate the downstream factor phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) a common polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene, the Arg972 IRS-1 polymorphism, is associated with impaired IRS-1 ability to activate the downstream factor phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase subjects without a history of MI (mean age 61.213.5 years; range, 25\u201375 years) were enrolled as controls. subjects with congenital heart diseases were excluded. blood samples were drawn on day 7 post MI from the acute MI subjects. all blood samples were subject to ELISA assays for serum ACE2 levels. superfectTM transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen. TRIzol reagent for RNA isolation, and the SYBR Green Master Mix were purchased. IRS-1 (sc-29376-V) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles, control shRNA lentiviral particles-A (sc-108080), and anti-ACE2 (sc-73668) antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. pools of stable transfectants were generated via selection with puromycin (5 g/ml) by the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. for hypoxia treatment, cells were respectively kept at 1% O2 for 24 hours in serum-free medium with or without 1 mg/L insulin. Western blot analysis Human cardiomyocytes were lysed in 250 l of 2 SDS loading buffer (62.5 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) equal amount of proteins (100 g) for each sample were separated by 8-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. comparison of serum ACE2 levels after acute MI was performed with analysis of covariance using serum ACE2 levels before acute MI as a covariate. the main effect of and interaction among Arg972 IRS-1 and MI on serum ACE2 levels were analyzed with ANOVA. MI severity score We used the Predicting Risk of Death in Cardiac Disease Tool (PREDICT) score to create an index of severity as previously described [19]. score components include shock (0 to 4 points), clinical history (MI, stroke, angina; 0 to 2 points), age (0 to 3 points), ECG findings (0 to 3 points), congestive heart failure (0 to 3 points), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (0 to 6 points) SensoLyte\u00ae 520 TACE (-Secretase) activity assay kit (72085) was purchased from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA, USA) Puromycin, LY294002 and all other chemicals of reagent grade were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) cell culture, lentiviral transduction, transfection of IRS-1 cDNAs, and application of hypoxia treatment. cDNAs were synthesized using TRIzol reagent. real-time quantitative PCR was performed on an abi-Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. the results were normalized against that of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. ish peroxidase conjugate was revealed with a GE Healthcare ECL kit. proteins were quantified before being loaded onto the gel. kinase activity was detected by the appearance of radiolabeled 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ([32P]PI-3-P) after TLC as described. only 2.6%-2.8% of subjects in the control and acute MI groups were homozygous Arg972 IRS-1 (AA) carriers. we combined Arg972 IRS-1 homozygotes (AA) and heterozygotes (GA) into one group (GA+AA) to compare with the wild type IRS-1 (GG) group. there was no significant difference in the allelic frequency between the acute MI subjects and the non-MI controls in total or by gender. 2.6 0.10 LDL- Cholesterol (mmol/L) 3.9 2.3 3.5 1.8 0.01a HDL- Cholesterol (mmol/L) 1.1 0.7 1.2 0.9 0.10 Triglycerides (mmol/L) 2.4 1.5 2.1 1.2 0.01a Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) 133.5 19.2 131.4 14.5 0.12 Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) 86.2 13.6 84.5 11.5 0. female control 125 (81.7) 26 (17.0) 2 (1.3) 0.36 276 (90.2) 30 (9.8) 0.49 (n=153) acute MI 101 (80.2) 20 (15.9) 5 (3.9) 222 (88.1) 30 (11.9) (n=126) no significant gender differences in the findings. the presence of Arg972 IRS-1 leads to significantly reduced serum ACE2 levels and more severe MI in acute MI patients independent of gender. the results indicate that the presence of ace2 levels leads to significantly reduced serum ACE2 levels and more severe MI in acute MI patients. serum angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) levels before and after acute myocardial infarction (mi) before acute MI After acute MI Total GG 7.24.2 16.48.2a (n=165) (n=49) Male GG 7.04.6 16.18.5a (n=105) (n=71) GA+AA 6.14.7 8.15.7b,c (n=34) Female GG 7.53.7 16.97.8a (n=60) (n=45 stably transfected cells showed marked increase in the protein detected by an anti-IRS-1 antibody. wild type IRS-1 or Arg972 IRS-1 was overexpressed in the transfected cardiomyocytes. both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished the induction of ACE2 mRNA by insulin plus hypoxia. ACE2 reportedly is shed by sheddase ADAM17 to produce soluble ACE2 [23], and ADAM17 expression reportedly is regulated by hypoxia [24], we next examined ADAM17 shedding activities in human cardiomyocytes. however, overexpression of IRS-1, overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1, or inhibition of PI3K showed no significant effects on the ADAM17 activity in cardiomyocytes. ds (VC) or stably transduced with scramble control shRNA were used as controls. cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hours in the presence or absence of LY294002 (LY, 50 M) or insulin (1 mg/. human cardiomyocytes stably transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmids was used as a control (VC) ap0.05 compared with any group under normoxia; bp0.05 compared with VC or SC under hypoxia+insulin (1 mg/L); cp0.05 compared with Arg972-IRS-1 under hypoxia+insulin (1 mg/L); dp0.05 compared with Arg972-IRS-1 under hypoxia+insulin ACE2 and -actin blots were measured by densitometry. the density of blots was normalized against that of -actin. it was expressed as fold changes to that of the VC cells under normoxia. human cardiomyocytes were stably transfected with wild type (WT) IRS-1 or Arg972 IRS-1. then the cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 hours. secreted/soluble ACE2 levels (ng/mL) in the cell culture media were determined by ELISA. overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1 slightly decreased the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia. both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished insulin-induced elevation of the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. hypoxia can significantly enhance the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes. human cardiomyocytes stably transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmids were used as a control (VC) Arg972 IRS-1 was associated with decreased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. Arg972-IRS-1 carriers had significantly lower serum ACE2 levels and higher MI severity scores compared with wild type-IRS-1 carriers after MI. findings also suggest an important role for insulin/IRS-1 signaling in the increased ACE2 expression after MI. myocardial hypoxia is a major factor in the pathophysiology of MI. overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1 had no significant effect on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes in normoxia. a small amount of endogenous wild type IRS-1 in the cells may well suffice for basal level of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and thereby ACE2 expression. this may explain why only Arg972 IRS-1 carriers with acute MI showed decreased serum ACE2 levels. insulin/IRS-1 signaling exerts cardioprotective effects after acute MI at least partially through increased ACE2 expression. Arg972 IRS-1 impairs insulin/IRS-1 signaling and results in decreased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. hypoxia can enhance induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
