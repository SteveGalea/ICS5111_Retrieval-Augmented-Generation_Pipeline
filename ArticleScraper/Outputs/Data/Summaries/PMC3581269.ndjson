{"summary": "traditional surveillance is based on definitive diagnosis and is enforced by the infection control laws in Japan for the early detection of agents of bioterrorism and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. syndromic surveillance monitors changes in the number of patients according to symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. yncytial virus (RSV) and M. pneumoniae infections (Figure 2). a primary feature of M. pneumoniae respiratory infections is the degree of the symptom worsening from mild upper respiratory tract inflammation to pneumonia. there are approximately 500 sentinel medical institutions in Japan. on September 26, 2011, we noticed an unusual peak and carefully monitored the real-time prescription surveillance system and observed a second peak on October 3, 2011. however, monitoring prescriptions for combination cold medications does not lead to the identification of the pathogens responsible for the illnesses being treated. syndromic surveillance system tracks prescription information, but patient symptoms and diagnoses are not recorded. surveillance of the last two is also classified by age: 15, 16\u201364, and >65 years. the cycleavePCR respiratory infection-pathogenic virus detection kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) was used to detect 11 types of viruses: human RSV types A and B, human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B viruses, human adenovirus, human bocavirus, and human rhinovirus. the accuracy of the hyper-PCR methods was confirmed by comparison with other conventional PCR methods. there is no nationwide syndromic surveillance system to electronically monitor medical records in the country. there are approximately 45,000 pharmacies that deliver almost half of the prescribed drugs nationwide and almost all prescription prescriptions electronically. syndromic surveillance system tracks prescription information, but patient symptoms and diagnoses are not recorded. surveillance of the last two is also classified by age: 15, 16\u201364, and >65 years. a rapid diagnosis kit suitable for use at outpatient clinics is currently available. al swabs to screen for adenovirus infections and 32 nasal swabs to screen for rapid RSV were collected. Viruses were extracted using immunochromatography (IC) kits with approximately 500 L of a mucolytic agent provided by the manufacturer. after the assay, approximately 200 L of the agent remained in the IC-kit tubes. the presence of coronavirus infection was tested in patients from whom no infectious agents were detected. the presence of coronavirus infection was tested in patients from whom no infectious agents were detected. the 50 patients tested included 2 infants (1 male and 1 female, aged 1 year), 25 children (12 males and 13 females, aged 1\u20136 years), 10 elementary school pupils (6 males and 4 females, aged 7\u201312 years), 4 minors (2 males and 2 females, aged 13\u201318 years), 8 adults (3 males and 5 females, aged >18 years), and 1 patient (age unavailable). sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 85%. for the rapid adenovirus diagnosis kit, no positive results were obtained. rhinovirus, enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus infections were not. in the future, it would be desirable to develop an M. pneumoniae diagnosis kit that can diagnose pathogens from nasal or pharyngeal swabs at outpatient clinics or the bedside of patients. the official pathogen surveillance has been conducted at sentinel medical institutions regardless of outbreaks. syndromic surveillance trials for nonspecific pathogens using PCR for undiagnosed infectious diseases have not been performed before. if severe cases were to occur, careful identification of pathogens would be desirable. if severe cases were to occur, careful identification of pathogens would be desirable. time M. pneumonia, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV have been identified. this news may have induced an abnormal increase in the number of patients. the rapid test available in Japan for M. pneumoniae uses sera samples."}
