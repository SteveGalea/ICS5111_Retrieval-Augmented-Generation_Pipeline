{"summary": "adults aged 50 and older were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups. 8-week training in mindfulness meditation matched 8-week training in moderate-intensity sustained exercise. primary outcome was area-under-the-curve global illness severity during a single cold and influenza season. in the united states each year, noninfluenza ARI accounts for more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days. symptoms of influenza infection are usually indistinguishable from those produced by other viruses. a recent observational cohort study reported 32% to 46% lower incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness among the most active vs least active participants. sufficient evidence exists to justify testing the hypothesis that training in meditation or exercise can reduce susceptibility to ARI illness. the experimental design used balanced, randomized allocation to 3 parallel groups: (1) mindfulness meditation, (2) moderate-intensity exercise, or (3) observational control. exercise The exercise program was designed and led by senior exercise physiology staff at the UW Health Sports Medicine Center. two of the 3 exercise instructors had master\u2019s degrees in clinical exercise physiology. the third had a bachelor\u2019s in sports management. the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) there were no specific adverse outcomes designated for monitoring. the last day of the ARI illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 using the first item of the WURSS instrument. a nasal wash was collected within 3 days of symptom onset and analyzed for interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil count and viral nucleic acid. the PSS-10 is a 10-item version of Cohen\u2019s Perceived Stress Scale. it is a 10-item version of Cohen\u2019s Perceived Stress Scale that has been linked to ARI outcomes. a sample size of 150 was based on power estimates contrasting (1) meditation vs control. to control for multiple testing, we chose a P.025 cutoff for null hypothesis rejection. to arrive at the primary outcome of area-under-the-curve global severity, we computed daily WURSS-24 scores by simple summation. randomized allocation was directed using computer-generated randomization codes. primary aim was to determine whether training in either meditation or exercise could reduce ARI illness burden compared with no intervention in the control group. measures included perceived stress, positive and negative emotion, perceived social support, anxiety, optimism, sleep quality. two of the 3 exercise instructors had master\u2019s degrees in clinical exercise physiology. the third had a bachelor\u2019s in sports management. the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the national institutes of health (NIH) the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the national institutes of health (NIH) there were no specific adverse outcomes designated for monitoring. recruitment methods included advertising in local media. the last day of the ARI illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 using the first item of the WURSS instrument, \"How sick do you feel today\" a nasal wash was collected within 3 days of symptom onset and analyzed for interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil count and viral nucleic acid. the 6-item Life Orientation Test (LOT) assesses cognitive aspects of optimism. to assess perceived social support, we used Ryff\u2019s 9-item Positive Relationships with others (PR) scale. zero-inflated regression models were used to control for potential confounders. models take into account both logistic (incidence) and linear (days of illness or global severity) data. RESULTS Of 883 adults screened, 204 were entered in the run-in trial. 2% were female, 94% were white, and their mean age was 59.3 6.6 years. n 47 51 51 Age, mean y (SD) 59.0 (6.6) 60.0 (6.5) 58.8 (6.8) 0.63 Female, n (%) 39 (83.0) 42 (82.4) 41 (80.4) 0.94 Nonsmokers, n (%) 43 (91.5) 48 (94.1) 48 (94.1) 0.84 Race,b n (%) 3 there were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of illness in the meditation group. there were 26 episodes and 241 ARI illness days for the exercise group, and 40 episodes and 453 ARI illness days for the control group. 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control. corresponding P values were.032 for illness days and.16 for global severity. both total days of illness (P =.033) and global severity (P =.010) appeared to be lower for meditation, but not for exercise. n (95% CI) 32 16 67 0.11 (0.01 to 0.24) P=.041 0.30 (0.19 to 0.40) P=.001 Mean ARI-related missed days, n (95% CI) 0.68 (0.1 to 1.2) 0.31 (0.1 to 0.5) 1.31 (0.5 to 2.1) 0.63 (0.4 to 1.6) P=.10 1.0 (0.2 to 1.8) P=.011 Total number of health care visits 116 116 n/HPF (95% CI) 103.7 (46.1 to 253.5) 107.9 (23.0 to 192.8) 110.4 (22.9 to 197.9) 6.7 (150.8 to 164.2) 2.5 (119.6 to 124.6) two nasal wash samples from the meditation group yielded both CoV and HRV. one ARI in the control group yielded both AdV and HRV. ARI = acute respiratory infection; global severity = area under curve time severity curve. 99 days of missed work (16 were ARI-related) and 116 health care visits (10 were ARI-related) total number of health care visits and total and ARI-related missed work days were not statistically distinguishable among the groups. ARI-related absenteeism, however, was significantly lower for the meditation group (P.001) and marginally so for the exercise group (P =.041) when compared with the control group. 4.82 (4.59 to 5.05) 4.55 (4.37 to 4.73) 4.73 (4.54 to 4.91) 4.60 (4.40 to 4.81) 4.59 (4.37 to 4.82) Indicators of good health (positive change indicates improvement) Physical health score (SF-12) 51.8 (49.3 to 54.2) 52.0 (49.4 to 54.6) 49.8 (47.2 to 52.3) 50.5 (48.0 to 53.1) 51.1 (48.5 to 53.6) 50.6 (47 scores 9.5 (7.8 to 11.2) 10.0 (8.2 to 11.7) 11.2 (1.7 to 12.8) 11.4 (1.6 to 12.3) 11.4 (9.5 to 13.2) Negative emotion score (PANAS) 14.0 (12.8 to 15.2) 14.4 (13.1 to 15.7) 15.0 (13.7 to 16.2) 15.0 (13.3 to 16.7) 14.6 (13.3 to 15.9) 14.9 (13.8 to 16.0) anxiety (STAI) score 30.2 (27.6 to 32.8) 29.1 (2 ARI illness were 29%, 43%, and 31% lower in the exercise group. compared with control, all-cause absenteeism was 31% lower in both intervention groups. compared with control, all-cause absenteeism was 31% lower in both interventions. the data do not suggest generalized self-report bias. if participants in the control group were overreporting ARI illness, they would expect them to report a similar magnitude of improved scores on other self-report health measures, which they did not do."}
