also be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium. we found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation >0.8. the top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph. this resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation >0.8. all proteins except DOC2G and MYBPHL had known roles in cardiac function. two myosin heavy chains, two essential myosin light chains and two regulatory myosin light chains interact to form the thick filament of the sarcomere. mylk3 Myosin light

pulmonary myocardium gene network is coregulated from loci on Chr1 and Chr2. all probe pairs within this set of 24 transcripts were positively correlated. heat-map analysis of eQTL for all 24 transcripts highlighted prominent regions of shared covariance on Chr1 and 2 with possible minor regions on Chr3, Chr4, Chr13, and Chr17. expression levels of multiple transcripts in this gene network were coordinatedly regulated by a shared set of cis and trans eQTL expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between BXD strains. expression level of all transcripts varied by

splicing. the Chr2: 68.8 0.4 Mb interval contained nine genes, three of which were expressed at appreciable levels in adult lung (Lass6, Nostrin, and Lrp2) but only two had known roles in gene regulation (Nostrin) or cell signaling (Lrp2). the transcription factors NKX2-5, SRF, MEF2A, TEAD1 and NR2F1 potentially cooperate to specify and/or maintain pulmonary myocardium identity. we interrogated previously published NKX2-5 ChIP-seq data derived from two sources. we also examined NKX2-5 enrichment at our candidate pulmonary myocardium control loci on Chr1 and Chr2. we also found NKX2-5 enrichment at Rab23, Zfp451 and Nostrin in the He et al. data set. NKX2-5 could directly regulate expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network. the pulmonary myocardium gene network was enriched in binding site sequences for SRF (serum response factor; 10 genes), TEAD1 (TEA Domain Family Member 1; 14 genes), NR2F1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group F, Member 1; 12 genes), and MEF2A (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2A; 18 genes). the absence of Nkx2-5 expression in adult lung is an apparent paradox. however, whether the lung sections sampled in the Fantom5 project actually contain pulmonary myocardium cannot be determined. pulmonary myocardium gene network and coexpressed genes are associated with cardiac phenotypes overlapping those of the stressed heart. the pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was significantly enriched with GO terms involving biological processes related to both striated and cardiac muscle function and development. enriched cellular components included contractile fiber and sarcomeric genes. 12 3.35e14 Cardiac muscle tissue development 14 4.36e14 Striated muscle tissue development 17 4.23e13 Molecular function Cytoskeletal protein binding 20 4.63e11 Titin binding 4 3.04e06 Protein binding 47 7.20e06 Monovalent inorganic cation transmembrane transporter activity 11 2.66e05 Cation transmembrane transporter activity 11 0.0001 Monovalent inorganic cation transmembrane transporter activity 11 0.0001 Mono interrogation of related signaling pathways with the KEGG pathway tool revealed enrichment for \u201cdilated cardiomyopathy\u201d and \u201chypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d genes. analyses with the WikiPathway tool demonstrated enrichment for \u201cstriated muscle contraction\u201d and \u201ccalcium regulation in the cardiac cell\u201d. the patient cohorts represent susceptibility to atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation when compared to control samples with no history of atrial fibrillation. we compared our genes of interest to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be dysregulated in atrial fibrillation. no change Cacna2d2 calcium channel, voltage-dependent, -2/ subunit 2 This gene encodes the -2/ subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex. no evidence 3.5e08 1.338e06 0.58825 AF/AF vs. AF/SR Scn5a Sodium channel, voltage-gated, type V subunit.

TNNI3 and ACTC1 was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set (12.422 units) weak staining of ACTC1 but not TNNI3 was detected in bronchial smooth muscle cells. TNNI3 and ACTA2 are localized to different structures in mouse lung. expression of TNNI3 has previously been used as a marker for pulmonary myocardium. the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts were enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function. we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation >0.8. all 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle. the top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph. this resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation >0.8. the functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified. l4 Atrial essential myosin light chain (ALC1) Myl7 Atrial regulatory myosin light chain (MYLC2a) Mybpc3 Cardiac myosin binding protein C Modulates the interaction between actin and myosin to regulate power output (Sequeira et al. 2015) Regulation of sarcomere assembly Mylk3 Myosin light chain kinase 3 Phosphorylates MY motif protein 20 Regulates alternative splicing of titin and other cardiac genes. pulmonary myocardium gene network is coregulated from loci on Chr1 and Chr2. top 100 transcripts correlated with Acta2 were enriched for smooth muscle-associated genes. all probe pairs within this set of 24 transcripts were positively correlated. all pairs had a Pearson correlation >0.5 with the exception of Myl4 and Doc2G (0.486), and Myl4 and Rbm20 (0.495). eQTL for all 24 transcripts highlighted prominent regions of shared covariance on Chr1 and 2 with possible minor regions on Chr3, Chr4, Chr13, and Chr17. all transcripts except one (Sln, sarcolipin) had either a suggestive (LRS >10.4) or significant (LRS >17) eQTL that mapped to the hotspot regions on Chr1 and Chr2 identified in the cluster map. one transcript, Myh6, varied by 2.62-fold between the highest and lowest expressing BXD strains. 4.469 2.38 Chr2 68.4\u201369.2 9 >17.78 Chr2 76.4\u201380.1 20 >11.02 Mybphl Chr3: 108.178 2.90 Chr1 32.5\u201334.5 15 >10.93 Chr2 77.8\u201378.7 6 Chr2 68.4\u201369.5 11 Chr4 49.6\u201354.9 27 Chr17 62.9\u201364 5 Myl7 Chr11: 5.796 2.65 Chr2 68.5\u201369.5 13 > 76.5\u201393.8 365 >16.98 Chr2 65.5\u201370.5 36 >10.6 Myh7 Chr14: 55.590 2.89 Chr1 32\u201334.5 15 >10.99 Chr6 67.5\u201376 103 Chr17 63\u201364 5 Sln Chr9: 53.698 2.37 Chr17 57\u201366 45 >10.92 Doc2g Chr19: 53.698 2.32 Chr1 23\u201325.5 17 >17.35 Chr2 68.6\u201370.3 20 >10. a second eQTL peak on Chr2: 77.5 1 Mb also reached significance for one gene (Mybpc3, Chr2) and was a suggestive eQTL for seven additional transcripts. genes within the peak linkage regions were interrogated to identify putative upstream regulatory genes. the function, localization, and mechanisms of action of RAB23 are still undefined. the gene encodes a member of the plakin protein family of adhesion junction plaque proteins 20.14 Chr2: 69 Mb 4932414N04Rik 117 Uncharacterized protein. protein encodes titin, a large abundant protein of striated muscle. titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins 24.76 Ccdc141 2 Role in radial migration and centrosomal function. nostrin has been shown to bind to and negatively regulate transcription of its own promoter via a centrally located bZIP DNA binding motif. a role for LRP2 has not yet been identified in either heart or lung. we interrogated previously published NKX2-5 ChIP-seq data from two sources. NKX2-5 binding sites were detected within 10 kb of seven genes. NKX2-5 binding sites were detected within 10 kb of seven genes. NKX2-5 (P 0.005) Dupay et al.

ACTC1 was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set (12.422 units) and was part of our pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network. further, Actc1 has previously been shown to be a direct target of NKX2-5 (Chen et al. 1996). a thin muscle coat positively staining for ACTA2 was situated beneath the columnar epithelium. staining of ACTC1 but not TNNI3 was detected in bronchial smooth muscle cells. no positive staining was detected with an isotype control antibody. serial sections of lung tissue were immunostained for (A) ACTA2, (B) TNNI3, (C) ACTC1 and (D) IgG isotype control (Isotype) we have used a systems-genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneously without prior knowledge of their identity. by correlating variation in gene expression and known BXD genotypes in a genome-wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associated with the expression of a cardiac gene network in the pulmonary myocardium. the eQTL interval located at Chr1: 33 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network. the eQTL interval located at Chr1: 33 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network. TTN regulates the passive stretch of cardiomyocytes via the I-band region of the protein which is comprised of sequential Ig, PEVK, and N2B domains. alternative splicing of Ttn results in a shorter ventricular isoform (N2B) and a longer atrial isoform (N2BA) both FHL2 and CARP have been shown to act as transcription factors in response to specific stimuli. CARP is upregulated at the myofibril and in the nucleus in response to stretch. CARP overexpression in murine neonatal cardiomyocytes represses expression of Anf, Actc1, Acta1, MHC, ventricular myosin light chain 2 (Myl2) and cardiac troponin C (Tnnc) hemodynamic changes trigger mechanosensory (stretch-stress) signaling from the sarcomere via TTN and initiate NO signaling cascades which are transmitted to the myocyte nucleus via NOSTRIN. these signals initiate dynamic regulation of gene expression to enable fine-tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium. BM20 is associated with altered splicing and expression levels of >200 genes. it is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype. the authors conclude that RBM20 underpins structural and functional development of cardiomyocytes. this gene is expressed at low levels in our gene network but is regulated from a suggestive eQTL on Chr1: 33. upregulation of Cacna2d2 subsequent to dysregulation of our gene network could predispose to gain of pacemaker activity. TBX5 is an essential factor for development of the cardiac conduction system. genes/loci identified in this study could be linked to atrial fibrillation in humans triggered by pulmonary events. this leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression, enabling fine-tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium. these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various heart diseases."}
