{"summary": "the study aimed to evaluate impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media. the retrospective cohort study included data for 803,592 children (10 years old) the incidence peaked in children 6\u201312 months old, and decreased with age. otitis media with effusion (OME) can occur as a post-inflammatory response to AOM. the effusion in the middle ear could decrease sound transmission, resulting in conductive hearing loss. national health insurance program covers nearly all (99%) of the 23 million residents of Taiwan [16]. every admission, operation, and outpatient visit record is included in this database. the influenza season is considered to run from October through March. the incidence of tympanostomy tube insertion was defined as the total number of outpatient visits during the influenza season, divided by the total person-season of the study population during the time period. the study population comprised 803,592 children 10 years old in influenza seasons between October 2000 and March 2007. the mean seasonal AOM incidence was 67 episodes/1000 person-seasons in those 10 years old. the incidence of AOM in childen 2 years old declined by 32.8% after introduction of TIV. IRR of outpatient visits with acute otitis media (AOM) in each age group in each influenza season was significantly lower than that in 2004. the number of outpatient visits for AOM in children 2 years old in the influenza season in 2005 and 2006 was significantly lower than that in 2004. patients who received one dose of vaccine, but had never received a dose before were classified as partially vaccinated. c Patients who did not receive any dose of vaccine were classified as non-vaccinated. with the increased vaccine coverage, the incidence of AOM declined. in the pre-TIV era, children 2 years had the highest incidence of AOM in the influenza season (98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons) after the introduction of TIV in 2004\u20132006, the incidence of outpatient visits with AOM declined significantly (66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons) influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus have been isolated from middle ear effusions [13\u201315]. influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are two important commercially available vaccines. the concept of \"prevention is better than cure\" has become increasingly popular in the battle between infectious organisms and the human immune system. data from 803,592 children over the period October 2000 through March 2007 were analyzed. outpatient visits in seven consecutive influenza seasons were studied. the secular trends in AOM incidence were followed before and after the introduction of TIV. a significant reduction in primary care consultations for children 2 years old was observed after the introduction of TIV in 2004. with increased vaccine coverage, there was an additional decline in the incidence of AOM in 2005 and 2006."}
