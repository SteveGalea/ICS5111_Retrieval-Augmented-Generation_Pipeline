{"summary": "the state of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including western Australia (WA). we used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in both states. management of the pandemic moved through three phases, described as Delay, Contain, and Protect. the phases were designed to delay the entry of pandemic virus into Australia, to contain the virus once it entered the country, to sustain a response once community transmission had been established. the state capitals, Melbourne and Perth, are approximately 3,400 km apart by road, on the south-east and west coasts respectively. the state capitals, Melbourne and Perth, are approximately 3,400 km apart by road, on the south-east and west coasts respectively. the effective reproduction number was calculated using an adaptation of the method of Bettencourt and co-workers [9]\u2013[11] to allow for imported cases and a distributed serial interval. the adaptation consists of cases being partitioned into local (L) and imported (M) cases. a probabilistic model is needed to allow for this variation. for a given R the probability of local cases at time t+ depends on the number of local and imported cases at time t. the difference between this and that presented in [9]\u2013[11] is that the number of locally acquired cases is used as the data at time t+ rather than all cases. we have verified this method using many thousand numerically simulated outbreaks with known values of R and different imported cases distributions. both approaches overestimate the true effective reproduction number as either too much transmission is assigned to local cases or imported cases are assigned as being locally acquired. numerical simulations were performed using a stochastic version of a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infective, recovered) type model. a stochastic model was used rather than a deterministic SEIR model as it better reflects the variability inherent in the early stages of an outbreak. interval of pandemic H1N1 of 1.9 days [20], 2.8 days [12], [16], [21], 3.2 days [22] and longer [23]. we performed 1000 simulations for each pair of values, and recorded the mean and standard deviation over these simulations. heterogeneities in contact patterns may also have some impact. the state capitals, Melbourne and Perth, are approximately 3,400 km apart by road, on the south-east and west coasts respectively. the state capitals, Melbourne and Perth, are approximately 3,400 km apart by road, on the south-east and west coasts respectively. the effective reproduction number was calculated using an adaptation of the method of Bettencourt and co-workers [9]\u2013[11] to allow for imported cases and a distributed serial interval. the adaptation consists of cases being partitioned into local (L) and imported (M) cases. the usual SIR infective equation can be written to the same degree of accuracy as in [9]\u2013[11] as according to the SIR model, detailed in [9]\u2013[11], the number of newly acquired local cases at time t+ due to the L+M cases at time t is then given by where is the mean infectious period. an initial unbiased estimate of P[R] is chosen to be a uniform distribution on [0 4], that is any value of R in [0 4] is equally likely. as a probability distribution for R is obtained, a 95% credible interval for the R value is easily obtained. new cases at time t were sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean RS(t)f()I(t), where S(t) is the fraction of the population susceptible and I(t) are the number of infected individuals at time t. we performed 1000 simulations for each pair of values, and recorded the mean and standard deviation over these simulations. we assumed that the reproduction number for children was twice that of adults, due to heightened mixing between children and lack of prior immunity. we assumed that the reproduction number for children was twice that of adults. only 5% of the first 100 cases in Victoria were imported. only eight of the 977 (0.8%) cases diagnosed prior to the introduction of the Modified Sustain phase reported a travel history. the earliest onset date of symptoms amongst the Victorian passengers was 18 May. nine passengers with a Victorian residential address were confirmed to have pH1N1 infection. public health authorities allowed passengers to disperse into the community because the ship had not visited any port where there were confirmed cases. simulations were performed using plausible reproductive numbers ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 and with mean serial intervals (MSI) ranging from 2 to 4 days. the length of time needed to obtain similar case notifications to the number observed around 29 May was determined. 1.8 11.6 (2.8) 16.1 (3.7) 19.3 (4.6) 21.2 (4.8) 25.7 (6.0) 31.6 (6.4) Each reproduction number/serial interval combination is the average number of days (and standard deviation) of 1,000 simulations for those values. the deviation away from 1.4 early in the simulated data is due to the low number of cases. only 5% of the first 100 cases in Victoria were imported. only eight of the 977 (0.8%) cases diagnosed prior to the introduction of the Modified Sustain phase reported a travel history. all cases notified to the department until 4 June inclusive were included in the analysis as they were assumed to be tested during the Delay or Contain phases. the number of cases in this chart decreases in the days prior to 4 June. values ranged from R = 2.7 around 20 May, when the first Victorian case was reported. values ranged from R = 2.7 around 20 May, when the first Victorian case was reported, and fell steadily and dramatically to 1.5 by 29 May. each reproduction number/serial interval combination is the average number of days before 29 May 2009 that the outbreak should have commenced. the deviation away from 1.4 early in the simulated data is due to the low number of cases. the first confirmed case of pandemic influenza was notified on 24 May, four days after notification of the first Victorian case, in a traveller returning from Canada via the US. by 30 June, 247 cases had been notified in WA. of these 16 (6%) were travellers from overseas countries with documented transmission. 94 (38%) were travellers from Victoria or locally acquired cases linked to Victorian-origin cases. the estimated value of R for the 1918\u201319 pandemic in San Francisco fell from 2.4 to 1.2 [9]. the dramatic decline in 9 days is more likely explained by unrecognised cases due to an earlier commencement of the epidemic in Victoria. higher values of R of 2 have been reported for Japan [16] and New Zealand [12]. in the northern hemisphere 78% of the first 98 cases had acquired their infection abroad [26] in the united kingdom 44% of the first 65 cases reported travel to the united states or Mexico [27] in the united kingdom 47% of the first 198 cases were described as imported [28] in the united kingdom 47% of the first 198 cases were described as imported [28] in the united kingdom 47% of the first 198 cases were described as imported [28] in the united kingdom 47% of the first 198 77 cases to the median age of 21 years in patients notified through the general practice surveillance scheme [32] suggested this implied an amplification of an established epidemic in school-aged children. we have previously established thresholds for the surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the state. phylogenetic analysis suggests that the pandemic virus may have entered the human population between November 2008 and March 2009. a second study suggests the virus may have been causing human infections as early as September 2008. a cluster of severe pneumonia in a sub-group of susceptible young adults in April 2009 could have represented the apex of the infectious pyramid. phylogenetic analysis suggests the virus may have entered the human population between November 2008 and march 2009. a second study suggests the virus may have been causing human infections as early as September 2008. a clinical attack rate below 1.4% due to pH1N1 has been estimated for the spring of 2009 in the US. attack rate was 10 times lower than the cumulative incidence of infection of 20%. we suggest that a relatively low clinical attack rate - but a much higher infection rate - by a virus causing generally mild disease would allow community transmission of the virus to go unrecognised for many weeks."}
