{"summary": "inpatients were eligible if they were admitted to the hospital with cough or difficulty breathing. children who were not residing in the KHDSS at admission were excluded. outpatient recruits were a convenience sample of children aged 13 years enrolled for broad comparison with hospital-admitted patients. individuals with URTI had either no signs of acute respiratory infection (non-ARI) or signs of upper respiratory tract infection. written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of subjects. RT-PCR assays included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus (CoV 229e, NL69, and OC43) aliquot of each of the influenza A virus\u2013positive specimens was shipped to the national Influenza Center (NIC) in Nairobi. SS population on 1 January 2009 was estimated to be 9451 individuals aged 1 year, 45 644 aged 5 years, and 108 708 aged 13 years. incidence estimation was undertaken using cases involving children aged 5 years admitted from administrative sublocations within a 5-km radius of the hospital. inpatients were eligible if they were admitted to the hospital with cough or difficulty breathing and either lower-chest-wall indrawing (severe pneumonia) or 1 or more of the following: cyanosis, prostration, unconsciousness, or an oxygen saturation level 90%. RNA was extracted from 140 L of nasopharyngeal samples using the Qiagen Viral RNA miniprep kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom) or from 200 L of nasopharyngeal samples using the total nucleic acid extraction kit. diagnostic screening for viral targets was performed using real-time RT-PCR. all other samples were screened using the Taqman Qiagen Quantifast multiplex method. the incidence of influenza among inpatients for age group i, I(i) per 100 000 population per year was estimated on the basis of the equation I(i) = [C(i)/N(i)p(i)]. p(i) is set to 1. The KDHSS population on 1 January 2009 was estimated to be 9451 individuals aged 1 year, 45 644 aged 5 years, and 108 708 aged 13 years. analysis was undertaken with cases of influenza and bacteremia temporally in phase or between 1 and 4 months time step out of phase. a total of 503 (21%) had very severe pneumonia (50% were boys; median age, 9 months [IQR, 3\u201334 months]; 55% were infants) the case-fatality rate among inpatients who were untested was significantly higher than among those who were tested (69 of 427 [16%] vs 88 of 2002 [4.4%]; P.0001) reasons for not testing included consent refusal (63%), early discharge (26%), and death (11%) before sampling. 196 outpatients had non-ARI (median age, 13 months [IQR, 5\u201326 months]; 47% were infants) there were 13 influenza diagnoses among outpatients with URTI. there were 14 influenza viruses detected because 1 child was coinfected. 101 influenza viruses were detected because 2 children were coinfected. the estimated incidence of severe or very severe pneumonia among children 1 year of age, 5 years of age, and 13 years of age was 3902 (95% CI, 3708\u20134106), 1321 (95% CI, 1269\u20131375), and 589 (95% CI, 567\u2013612) cases per 100 000 population per year. for all inpatients with influenza, the incidence of severe or very severe pneumonia for those aged 1 year, 5 years, and 13 years was 154 (95% CI, 116 over the 4-year period, influenza A and B virus infection showed a significantly higher occurrence among inpatients during quarters 3 and 4, relative to the average for all quarters. the majority of influenza B virus infections occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. outpatients aged 13 years who presented with URTI, 7 had A(H3N2), 3 had A(H1N1), and 0 had A(H1N1)pdm09. the distribution of subtypes over time is shown in Figure 2. Temporal distribution, by quarter, of influenza A virus subtypes. one inpatient was infected with influenza A virus, 2 were infected with influenza B virus, and 1 inpatient had chronic heart disease. prevalence of influenza virus of any type was 4.9% (99 of 2002 cases) among inpatients; 4.7% (76 of 1615) had severe pneumonia, and 5.9% (23 of 387) had very severe pneumonia. there were 13 influenza diagnoses among outpatients with URTI, but 14 influenza viruses were detected because 1 child was coinfected (with influenza A and C viruses in one and influenza A and C viruses in the other) there were 99 influenza diagnoses among all inpatients with pneumonia, but 101 influenza viruses were detected because 2 children were coinfected. the incidence of severe or very severe pneumonia among children aged 1 year, 5 years, and 13 years was 106 (95% CI, 75\u2013149), 43 (95% CI, 34\u201355), and 20 (95% CI, 16\u201325) cases per 100 000 per year. the incidence estimates of severe or very severe pneumonia were 1815 (95% CI, 1700\u20131938), 106 (95% CI, 78\u2013144), and 70 (95% CI, 48\u2013102) cases per 100 000 per year nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected each quarter are shown on the secondary Y axis (triangle markers) the number of admissions with bacteremia (x markers) and S. pneumoniae (o markers) the numbers of nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected each quarter are shown on the secondary Y axis. around 50% of cases in infants (46% had influenza A virus infection, 47% had influenza B virus infection, and 66% had influenza C virus infection; P =.632) the proportion of inpatients with pneumonia who were found to be influenza positive showed a trend for increase with increasing age. 5% of inpatients and 3.3% of outpatients with URTI are inpatients. incidences of influenza (64 cases per 100 000 per year) and influenza A virus infection (46 cases per 100 000 per year) were low. there was near absence of influenza in convenience sample of children without signs of respiratory illness. the etiology of rhinovirus as the causative agent of lower respiratory tract disease may be in question [10] this is not the case for RSV, which is invariably among the most prevalent viruses in children admitted with lower respiratory tract illness. contemporary data on the relative prevalence of respiratory viruses among pneumonia-related admissions to the hospital are largely absent. antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) was prescribed to children admitted to KDH with severe acute respiratory illness on a presumptive basis. this would not have altered the pattern of observation of influenza described in this study. half of the cases occurred in infants, and the proportion of cases rapidly declined with age into older age groups. the low prevalence of influenza viruses in this study limits the power of the analysis to identify associations between virus presence and specific clinical features or coinfections. the study involved sampling of 2000 children; a definitive investigation of clinical associations will require a considerably larger sample size or a location with a markedly higher incidence of influenza A virus infection. infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/).
