{"summary": "miasmist theory was later challenged by the \u2018contagionists\u2019 who believed that disease was spread by organisms passed from person to person. the contagionists purported a single causative agent for any disease (3). the contagionists\u2019 germ theory was widely adopted as the predominant paradigm of the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. et al (5) concluded that the phenomenon was due entirely to a reduction in deaths from infectious diseases. they specifically suggested that the main influences over the decline included an improved standard of living and diet, improved hygiene standards, and favourable conditions. despite great advances in the understanding of microorganisms and disease, the germ theory of one causative agent and one disease does not address the evolving health problems of our contemporary society. economic forces in the 1970s led to a period of greater scrutiny and reduced federal funding for the expansion of health care services. there was growing recognition that the substantial declines in mortality had not been prompted by medical advances. this prompted a period of renewed thinking about how to address the health of the public in Canada (7). a heightened understanding of the influence that ecological and social factors can have on the health of contemporary Canadians clarified the need to effectively coordinate efforts to address these risks. the role of the PHAC is to prevent and control chronic diseases and injuries; prevent and control infectious diseases; prepare for and respond to public health emergencies; serve as a central point for sharing Canada\u2019s expertise with the rest of the world. to deliver on this mandate, public health action in Canada requires the coordinated efforts of a wide variety of stakeholders. the determinants of health interact in complex ways with our rapidly evolving human ecology to influence health-related behaviours and health status. the need for appropriately trained individuals to support these new technologies and therapeutic procedures became obvious. 'inhalation therapist','respiratory technologist', 'anesthetic technician' and the contemporary RT all find common lineage in this history (14,16). RTs quickly developed into highly educated and skilled professionals who function as part of an interdisciplinary team of health professionals delivering primarily acute care services. a move toward more community-level health promotion activity in respiratory therapy. RTs are also on the forefront of emergency preparedness planning for events such as impending influenza pandemics. the adoption of readily available tools, such as the air quality index, into practice is an example of one such opportunity. the CSRT has specifically called for increasing capacity among entry to practice respiratory therapy to understand and participate in health promotion and prevention initiatives. the CSRT has identified the need for respiratory therapists to have a broader scope of knowledge, critical thinking and independent decision making skills to provide optimal care in the future. a professional responsibility to help achieve optimal respiratory health for all Canadians is evolving. it is time for RTs to consider whether the current logic model they use in practice continues to effectively and universally respond to each contemporary respiratory health challenge."}
