{"summary": "the computations were done via auxiliary variables ym, n, k, j. the probability that a HGRW with m up-steps achieves a maximum descent of size k exactly. the descent does not need to be k consecutive down steps. recursions for the p-variables reduce to: p m, n, k = l = k n x m, n, l, (3) and recursions for the p-variables reduce to: p m, n, k + n m + n p m, n 1, k + n m + n p m, n 1, k + n m + new source code and manual can be downloaded from http://mol.ax/3seq. the 3SEQ maximum descent statistic describes clustering patterns in sequences of binary outcomes. results of one type (of a binary outcome variable) do not necessarily have to cluster or rank at the beginning or end of a sequence of data points. the hypergeometric walk is shown graphically. the exact P value is computed with the methods in this article. we list two practical examples of our nonparametric clustering statistic. full-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 2, dengue virus serotype 2 and the coronavirus responsible for Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were downloaded from NCBI and aligned with the online NCBI alignment tools.
