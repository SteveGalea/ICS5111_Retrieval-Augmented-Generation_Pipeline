{"summary": "the role of a hospital is basically to be a line of defense against the spread of these infections and diseases. hospitals with inadequate building facilities have unexpectedly become the most hazardous areas, zones of defenselessness that undermine the entire medical and healthcare system. poor initial facility design and construction with little maintenance often result in a deterioration of the health infrastructure, a situation that may pose a danger to both patients and staff. studies have developed a number of methods and models for evaluating existing building conditions and supporting decisions pertaining to building renovation. some studies have proposed strategies to deal with waste pollution and diseases spread in built environments. some studies have proposed strategies to deal with waste pollution and diseases spread in built environments [21,22,23,24] yearly average energy use intensity (EUI) for hospital buildings is estimated at 389.8 kBtu/ft2, second only to supermarket/grocery buildings estimated at 480 kBtu/ft2 in the united states. a systematic approach to managing these periodic maintenance and renovation activities is imperative. the green guide for health care is a voluntary, self-certifying metric toolkit of health-based best practices. healthcare facilities present unique opportunities for developing and implementing sustainable design, construction, and operations practices. issues such as 24/7 operations, energy and water use intensity, chemical use, infection control, and regulatory requirements can pose significant obstacles to implementing sustainability protocols. these criteria are highly related to assessment of infection control, patients\u2019 contaminants management, and indoor air quality control in the hospital [38,40]. the physical condition and space utilization condition assessments of building systems that are not directly related to environmental sustainability are excluded from this study. ant comfort Climate control, windows insulation, indoor air quality Indoor chemical and pollution control Chemical and pollution control Devices Pollution and waste Pollution Preventing technologies or devices for refrigerant, water course and night time light pollution. assessment score (before Renovation) Improved score (after Renovation) Renovation level Cost (per unit) Improved score 1.

Figure 1 shows the interface of condition assessment system providing assessment items and their improvement actions. the Green Guide directly incorporates the language of a parallel LEED credit. existing LEED credits have been modified to respond to the unique needs and concerns of healthcare facilities. the building research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is an environmental assessment method for new or existing buildings in the UK. the focus of this study is to evaluate environmental conditions of existing buildings and to recommend an optimal scheme of sustainable renovation strategies. criteria such as location, transportation, regional priority and innovation are not considered in the research. the principles of rating rules are separated into two parts: current condition assessment scores and improvement scores. in order to quantify the quality of renovation strategies, improvement scores are also simply rated by three levels according to the renovation involvement. the interface of condition assessment system provides assessment items and their improvement actions with photos and explanations. the final scores are the sum of the assessment score for each criterion and the improved score for each renovation strategy. A* search is the most widely known form of best-first search and optimally efficient for any given consistent heuristic. the concept of A* is to explore a graph through traversing to find the optimal path according to its specific rules. however, A* is not practical for many large-scale problems. i = 1 m j = 1 n X i j C i j (2) subject to: i = 1 n X i j C i j C i j C T (3) j = 1 n X i j = 1 For i = 1, 2,..., n (4) where Z1 and Z2 are the objective functions maximizing the total score and minimizing the total cost of selected actions. a random process generates the initial population for each chromosome [46] and each chromosome of traditional GA in the initial population is generated randomly. previous experimental results have shown that the GA does not always result in good solutions due to the random method. a* search is the most widely known form of best-first search and optimally efficient for any given consistent heuristic. some study has demonstrated the potential of using the hybrid algorithm of GAA* to deal with the large-scale zero-one programming determinate problem effectively [14] the optimization problem can be formulated as follows: M a x Z 1 = i = 1 m j = 1 n X i j C i j (2). in developed countries, 95%\u201397% of buildings are existing buildings. adaptive reuse of vacant buildings is an efficient way to use obsolete existing buildings by \u201crecycling\u201d them in-situ, thereby providing them a new functional purpose [53]. community hospitals provide short-term general specialist and hospitalization, including referral resource, first aid and emergency, hospitalization service, prevention and public health service. the government has actively proposed building reuse policies with respect to converting vacant public buildings to other public facilities, such as community hospitals. reusing these school buildings as they become vacant by converting them to other public facilities, such as community hospitals, in these years. no heat insulation technologies for walls 0 Heat Island Reduction\u2014opening 3.
