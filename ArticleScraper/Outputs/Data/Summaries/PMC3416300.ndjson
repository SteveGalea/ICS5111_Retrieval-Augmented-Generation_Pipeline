{"summary": "helicases are motor proteins that use the free energy of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to unwind nucleic acid duplexes during gene replication, transcription, translation, recombination, and repair. they are encoded in the genomes of all living organisms and have been classified into six superfamilies (SF1 to SF6). a protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa (130K protein) and a read-through product with a molecular mass of 180 kDa (180K protein) these two replication proteins are both involved in viral-RNA replication. the helicase-like domain interacts with itself (13) and with more than 10 host proteins (17) during viral-RNA replication. to express selenomethionine-labeled ToMV-Hel, cells were transformed with expression vector pDEST-trx-ToMV-Hel. cells were cultured in leMaster medium (28) and then transformed with pDEST-trx-ToMV-Hel. the crystals were flash frozen under a cryogenic stream of nitrogen. the X-ray diffraction data set for the native crystal was collected at the KEK Photon Factory BL17A beamline, Japan. the crystallographic model was refined to 1.9- resolution using CNS (2). more than 90% of residues in the model were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot by PROCHECK (26). c CC = [wEoEcw wEowEc]/[wEo2w (wEo)2] [wEo2w (wEo)2]12; w, weight (see http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelx_de.pdf for full definitions). to create an expression plasmid for each toMV-Hel fragment as an N-terminal nubG-tagged fusion protein, the TOM2A fragment bordered by the NcoI and PstI sites in pTN-NubG-TOM2A (45) was replaced with one of the toMV-Hel fragments. the fragment was digested with SpeI and SalI and used to replace the mating factor coding region bordered by the SpeI and plasmid was selected using Southern blot hybridization (3). the strain was transformed with the pMN-ARL8-NubG (34) and pMN-TEF-699-732 plasmids. pDEST-trx-ToMV-Hel was then expressed and purified. the native and SeMet-labeled toMV-Hels were crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 285 K. the crystals were grown on siliconized coverslips by equilibrating a mixture containing 1.5 l of a protein solution. the crystals were flash frozen under a cryogenic stream of nitrogen. diffraction data sets were processed using the HKL2000 suite of programs (35). diffraction data sets were processed using the HKL2000 suite of programs (35). c CC = [wEoEcw wEowEc]/[wEo2w (wEo)2] [wEc2w (wEc)2]12; w, weight (see http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelx_de.pdf for full definitions). reporter strain L40 and plasmids for nubG-ALG5, TOM1-Cub-PLV, and ARL8-Cub-PLV expression have been described previously. fragments corresponding to the ToMV helicase and upstream regions were PCR amplified from pTLW3 (24) to create an expression plasmid for each toMV-Hel fragment as an N-terminal NubG-tagged fusion protein. a transformant was selected using Southern blot hybridization (3). the strain was transformed with the pTN-TOM1-Cub-PLV plasmids. the final model contains 440 of the 451 expected residues. the N-terminal region (residues S666 to V801) forms a domain that tightly binds domain 1A. the N-terminal domain contains a flexible loop (L688 to P700), a long -helix (L701 to D730), and an antiparallel, six-stranded -sheet (F742 to E798) domains 1A (V802 to R964) and 2A (T965 to Q1116) and the N-terminal domain (S666 to V801) are colored green, blue, and yellow, respectively. the three-dimensional structures shown as ribbon diagrams. the toMV-Hel helicase core is most similar to those of upf1-like, UvrD/Rep, and Pif1-like helicases. the helicase core is most similar to those of upf1-like, UvrD/Rep, and Pif1-like helicases. SF1 helicases contain at least 12 characteristic sequence motifs at defined positions in their helicase cores (9) however, it was difficult to identify all the helicase motifs in viral SF1 helicases only through comparison of amino acid sequences because of low sequence conservation. conserved and conservatively replaced residues are highlighted in green and yellow. gray shading indicates that there are no consensus amino acids, but they are at the same positions as other proteins. amino acid residues comprising the putative RNA-binding site are structurally homologous to those found in nonviral SF1 helicase motifs that interact with DNA. sulfates, which were included in the crystallization solution as a precipitant, are found in the deep cleft formed by domains 1A and 2A. toMV-Hel K839 in motif I directly contacts a second sulfate. this sulfate position corresponds to those of the ADPNP and AMPPNP -phosphates in the PcrA-ADPNP and in the hUPf1-AMPPNP complexes. amino acid substitutions in the TMV helicase at positions equivalent to K839 in motif I. the net charge on the -sheet surface is positive (Fig. 4A) the modes of interaction between DNA and different SF1 helicases are not conserved. it was interesting to compare residues in these regions with those of ToMV-Hel. onine in motif Ia, the histidine in motif IV, the arginine in motif IV, and the threonine and histidine in motif V are well conserved. similarities and differences in the sequences between nonviral SF1 helicases and ToMV-Hel suggest that ToMV-Hel might recognize the bases and backbone phosphates of RNA via a mechanism that is different from those of nonviral SF1 helicases. the solvent-accessible V1087 is positioned in the loop that connects 5 and 6 in domain 2A, suggesting that the surface region near or surrounding V1087 interacts with PAP1. the tomato Tm-1 encodes a protein that inhibits ToMV RNA replication by binding to the replication proteins (16) both sets of mutations abolish the interaction between replication proteins and Tm-1 (16) surrounded by the hydrophobic residues V703, M706, and I710 of the long -helix in the N-terminal domain and L815, L816, and V823 in the loop between 1 and 1 in domain 1A. we speculate that the N protein recognizes a TMV-Hel region containing the N-terminal domain. s the full-length 130K replication protein (34) may be responsible for the in vivo association. additional assays suggested that the fragment (G699 to A732) that contains the long -helix could interact with TOM1 and ARL8. therefore, the -helix probably binds TOM1 and ARL8 simultaneously. we have determined the first viral SF1 helicase structure. we have found an -helix that is important for the association of the helicase and host factors. to investigate this, the secondary structures of SF1 helicases of eight positive-strand RNA viruses were predicted using Jpred (6). the sequences that form -strands and -helices in the toMV-Hel crystal structure are highlighted in blue and magenta cylinders. the sequences predicted by Jpred to form -strands and -helices are highlighted in blue and magenta, respectively. the N-terminal region (residues S666 to V801) forms a domain that tightly binds domain 1A. the long -helix interacts with the groove formed by the domain 1A -helices D805 to R814 and H911 to F918. structure of toMV-Hel.
