{"summary": "the viral genome is bi-segmented and encodes four viral proteins. the large segment of genomic RNA encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L protein and the small zinc finger Z protein. the small segment of genomic RNA encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) LASV has been estimated to infect up to 300,000 humans. it causes approximately 5,000 to 6,000 deaths annually in west africa. LF is of major public importance in areas of endemicity. pathogenic viruses, including MACV and LASV, must be handled in biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities. the pathogenesis and the host immune response to the highly pathogenic OW arenavirus LASV are likely different from those described for the pathogenic LASV from the OW (16). clinical studies have revealed that human infections with the NW arenavirus JUNV are often accompanied by elevated and high levels of serum IFN- (2,000 to 64,000 IU/ml) (17, 18), which MACV (Romero strain), MACV (Carvallo strain) and LASV (Josiah strain) were prepared as described previously. supernatants were harvested and centrifuged, followed by filtration. more than 95% of cells of the monocyte preparations were confirmed as CD14+ by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. RNA lysates were prepared from infected cells with TRIzol reagent. cDNA synthesis was carried out using an iScript Advanced cDNA synthesis kit for real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) to avoid potential host chromosome DNA contamination, RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Qiagen) the membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. proteins were visualized with ECL-2 Western blotting detection reagents (Thermo Scientific) the mouse monoclonal antibody detects the NPs of JUNV and MACV. human A549 cells were mock infected or infected with the highly pathogenic NW arenavirus MACV or the OW arenavirus LASV. at 1, 2, and 3 dpi, cellular protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), STAT1 protein, ISG15, RIG- OW LASV coinfection eliminated the NW MACV-activated IFN response. at 40 h post-MACV infection, IFN- protein levels in supernatant were measured by ELISA. virus stocks were propagated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 on Vero cells. supernatants were harvested and centrifuged, followed by filtration (0.45-m pore size) to remove cell debris and further purification with Ultralcel 100K filters. s were cultured in RPMI 1640 differentiation medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 2 mM glutamine, 50 ng/ml human interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 250 ng/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. half of the medium was removed and replaced with fresh differentiation medium. cDNA synthesis was carried out using an iScript Advanced cDNA synthesis kit. real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed with a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) proteins were visualized with Western blotting detection reagents. primary antibodies used for WB analysis were rabbit anti-phosphorylated STAT1 antibody (9171 for the experiments shown in Fig. 1 and 5 and 9167 for the experiments shown in Fig. 3 and 6. human moDCs were mock infected with the highly pathogenic NW arenavirus MACV or the OW arenavirus LASV at an MOI of 1. at 1, 2, and 3 dpi, cellular protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), STAT1 protein, ISG15, RIG-I, MACV NP protein, LASV NP, and human -actin. at 40 h post-MACV infection, IFN- protein levels in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. data are presented as the means SEM of three experiments. the NW pathogenic arenavirus MACV activated IFN responses in human dendritic cells. MACV and MACV both induced remarkably and significantly higher levels of IFN- mRNA in moDCs from 1 dpi to 3 dpi. IFN- protein expression was detected from 1 dpi to 3 dpi. neither IFN- nor IFN- could be detected in the medium. we found enhanced ISG protein expressions (ISG15 and STAT1) in JUNV- or MACV-infected MoDCs but not in LASV-infected or mock-infected samples. the replication of LASV in MoDCs was productive, with peak virus titers at 2 105 PFU/ml at 2 dpi. the NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV could activate IFN responses in human A549 cells. but it was unknown whether LASV infection could induce IFN responses. we compared the host IFN response to infections with NW and OW highly pathogenic arenaviruses. the highly pathogenic NW arenavirus LASV blocked NW human-pathogenic arenavirus MACV-induced IFN response. OW arenavirus LASV blocked NW human-pathogenic arenavirus MACV-induced IFN response. all viruses replicated at comparable levels. LASV (MOI of 1) was introduced to MACV-infected cells at 1 h before (time T1) MACV infection, at the same time (T0) as MACV infection, or at 1 h after (T+1) or 3 h after (T+3) MACV infection. no upregulation of IFN- was detected in any of the LASV/MACV-coinfected samples. MACV infection, IFN- protein expression in samples infected by MACV alone was approximately 50% of that in samples infected by MACV alone. in coinfection MACV and LASV did not interfere with each other's replication at these time points. in previous studies, we found that elicited IFN responses in human A549 cells. we infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with the NW JUNV, NW MACV, or OW LASV at an MOI of 1. IFN- mRNA levels were upregulated by 150-fold (JUNV) or 250-fold (MACV) at 1 dpi compared with the levels of mock-infected samples. neither IFN- nor IFN- could be detected in the medium from mock-infected samples during infection. values of targeting genes were normalized to the average CT values of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and -actin housekeeping genes. supernatants were harvested from virus-infected MoDCs and analyzed for IFN- protein and IFN- protein expression by ELISAs. despite the lower infectivity of JUNV and MACV in MoDCs, infections with JUNV and MACV readily triggered IFN responses in MoDCs. in comparison, LASV productively infected human MoDCs but failed to activate an IFN response in human A549 cells. however, it was unknown whether LASV infection could induce IFN responses in this cell line. increasing amounts of IFN- protein were readily detected in the medium from JUNV- or MACV-infected A549 cells but not in that from LASV-infected cells. further characterization revealed that LASV infection did not lead to detectable changes in phosphorylation of STAT-1 (Fig. 5), indicating that the IFN signaling pathway remained inactivated during LASV infection. natants from infected cells were measured by ELISA. the OW human-pathogenic arenavirus LASV blocked MACV-induced IFN response. it was evident that the host IFN responses to infections with highly pathogenic NW JUNV and MACV were distinct from the response to the infection. MACV infection did not affect replication either. MACV infection could completely block the MACV-triggered IFN response. at 6 h post-MACV infection, LASV coinfection suppressed MACV-induced IFN- protein expression by 95%. the highly pathogenic OW arenavirus LASV blocks host innate and adaptive immune responses and causes severe and often fatal diseases. MACV infection also induces IFN production in a lethal NHP model (19) we demonstrated that JUNV and MACV could activate IFN responses in human dendritic cells. results indicated that human dendritic cells were capable of detecting infections by JUNV and MACV. this observation is in accord with previous studies reporting that infection of murine dendritic cells with pathogenic JUNV isolates resulted in IFN production. the lung epithelial A549 cell line as a cell culture model might potentially facilitate study of the host response to arenavirus infection. however, data from study with A549 cells needs to be further validated in dendritic cells and macrophages. we also suggested that parenchymal cells, in addition to dendritic cells, could be the source of IFN production in vivo. the host IFN pathway responded more efficiently to infections by JUNV and MACV in human cells. the OW pathogenic arenavirus LASV readily elicited IFN responses. the inability of the IFN pathway to respond to LASV infection could possibly be due to either LASV active inhibition of the IFN pathway or evasion of host detection by the IFN pathway. the window for LASV inhibition as shown in Fig. 6 is unlikely due to differential entry kinetics of LASV and MACV. host cells more likely have detected a \u201cdanger signal\u201d associated with MACV replication rather than an immediate early signal. otherwise, one would observe an early wave of IFN production, which is not the case. the impact of IFN or cytokines on virus infection and pathogenesis is not well understood. the race between the host immune response and virus replication begins very early during the course of viral infection. IFNs and cytokines also stimulate and regulate cell-mediated innate and adaptive immune responses. we find that IFNs are critical to control JUNV and MACV infections in murine systems. in an NHP model, an early peak of type I IFN production correlated with animal survival. fatal infection was characterized by a lack of early type I IFN production."}
