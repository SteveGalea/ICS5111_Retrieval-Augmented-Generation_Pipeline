{"summary": "GB virus C (GBV-C) is a common human virus that can be transmitted sexually, parenterally and vertically from mother to child [1], [2]. infection of immunocompetent individuals usually leads to clearance of GBV-C viraemia within the first years; however, GBV-C can cause persistent infection in approximately 25% of cases. GBV-C RNA prevalence rates range from 20% to 30% in HCV coinfected individuals and from 15% to 40% in HIV-1 patients. epidemiological studies and a meta-analysis have reported that viraemia has a beneficial effect on the course of HIV-1 disease progression and survival. two overlapping 20 mer peptides (P4-7 and P6-2) presenting amino acids 37 to 56 (WDRGNVTLLCDCPNGPWVWV) and 45 to 64 (LCDCPNGPWVWVPAFCQAVG) were shown to be most potent with IC50s between 2 and 0.2 M in a TZM-bl-based HIV-1 replication assay. cell entry of HIV-1 is mediated by noncovalently associated trimers of gp peptides P4-7 and 6-2 represent the E2 residues from 37 to 64. they act late after CD4 and coreceptor engagement via binding the gp41 disulfide loop region. all other peptides were synthesized by a standard FMOC method. 293T cells were co-transfected with pNL4-3 proviral DNA, pCMV-BlaM-Vpr, and pAdVAntage vectors. after 2 days of cultivation, the virus-containing supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 300g to remove cellular debris. the pellet was resuspended in medium and aliquots were frozen at 80\u00b0C until usage. virions containing BlaM-Vpr were allowed at low temperature via spinning inoculation. virions were added to cells and centrifuged at 2095g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min. virions were added to cells and centrifuged at 2095g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min. 293T cells were transiently transfected with either pCD4 or pCCR5 expression plasmids. similar amounts of soluble Fc-gp120 or Fc control were added for 45 min on ice. washed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed with a flow cytometer. 425B4e8 (all NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), 40 g/ml 5F3 (Polymun Scientific), 0.6 M E2340-Fc or Fc control, 0.2 mM P4-7, P6-2 or P28 and additionally 10 g/ml HIV-1BaL or HIV-1IIIB gp120 protein (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) Flow cytometer data were collected with BD FACSDivaTM and analyzed with FCS Express V3. gp160 expression was determined by staining with HIV-1 gp120 mAbs (2G12 and 17b) and an anti-human IgG-FITC pAb. 96-well polystyrene plates were coated with the 6-HB-specific monoclonal antibody, NC-1 IgG, and then blocked with 2% non-fat milk. after incubation for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, C34-biotin was added, followed by incubation for 45 min at 37\u00b0C and washing with wash buffer six times. gp160 signal peptide comprising residues 1 to 30 was removed prior to similarity searches because it is not present in the mature protein. all other peptides were synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method. peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography. peptides were dissolved in 75% DMSO/H2O and diluted for experiments in respective buffers or medium. clone SK3, CXCR4 clone 12G5, and CCR5 clone 2D7, BD Biosciences, Germany. washed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed with a flow cytometer. 5104 TZM-bl cells infected with sucrose-purified HIV-1 NL4-3 virions. the extent of virus-cell fusion was determined from the ratio of blue (460 nm) and green (510 nm) emission upon exciting the cells at 405 nm. 293T cells were transiently transfected with either pCD4 or pCCR5 expression plasmids. after 2 days of cultivation, cells were resuspended in binding buffer. cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in triton X-100. cells were incubated with 1 g sCD4 and 1 M FITC-conjugated E2 peptides for 1 h at 37\u00b0C respectively. cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a BDTM LSR II flow cytometer. gp160 expression was determined by staining with HIV-1 gp120 mAbs (2G12 and 17b) and an anti- the recombinant protein was adjusted at 5 g/ml and the monoclonal gp41 antibodies (246-D, F240, T32, D50, 2F5, 4E10, Chessie 8 [all: NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program], and 5F3 [Polymun, Austria] at 100 M. plates were developed with TMB peroxidase substrate solution (KPL, USA), or with OPD/H2O2 streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase and the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine were added sequentially. absorption at 450 nm (OD450) was measured. the percent inhibition of 6-HB formation by the peptides was calculated. surface presentation of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 was quantified via flow cytometry. the non-HIV-1-inhibitory peptide P28 derived from the C-terminal part of E2 (residue 271 to 290) served as a negative control. the effect of GBV-C E2 Peptides Arises After gp120/CD4 and gp120/coreceptor engagement was determined using a virus-cell fusion assay under standard (pre-CD4 binding) and temperature-arrested state (TAS; post-CD4 binding) conditions. antibodies b12 (anti [a]-CD4-binding site [bs]) and B4 (a-CD4) are early inhibitors interfering with CD4 engagement. 2F5 (MPER antibody) and AMD-3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) act after CD4 binding. positive controls revealed a clear reduction in the gp120/CCR5 and a less pronounced decline in the gp120/CXCR4 interaction. however, after normalization of the band intensity there was no indication for any E2-effect on the binding efficiency between gp120 and the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 respectively. soluble HIV-1 gp120 was added to the CD4-, CCR5-, or CXCR4-expressing cells. binding was investigated by separating cell lysates on SDS-PAGE. no influence of E2 peptides or intact E2 protein on binding efficiency. negative control peptide P28 suggests that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides bind to HIV-1 Env. this interaction seems to be CD4-dependent, since conformational changes in gp120 and/or the increase in availability of gp41 after CD4 engagement facilitates E2-binding. gp120 and gp41 were coated with recombinant full-length gp120. the recombinant fusion protein (E2340-Fc) was shown to interact with both gp41 variants in a dose-dependent manner. the peptides bind to the disulfide loop of gp41. Gp41 consists of the N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), the N- and C-heptad repeats (NHR, CHR) that are connected by the disulfide loop region (C-C loop), the membrane proximal external region (MPER), the -helical transmembrane-spanning domain (TM) and the cytoplasmic tail (CP). competition assays were performed with the N-terminal E2 peptides P4-7 and P6-2. results revealed that both HIV-1-inhibitory E2 peptides abrogated the protein-protein interaction between HIV-1 gp41 and GBV-C E2 in a dose-dependent manner. the negative control peptides P9 and P28 had no effect. the transmembrane protein gp41 consists of several functional regions. the FP, TM and CP regions of gp41 do not appear to be involved in the interaction with GBV-C E2 or E2 peptides. a competitive ELISA was performed to test whether the E2 peptides interact with either the NHR or CHR regions of gp41. no unspecific binding between the E2 peptides (P4-7 and P6-2) and the antibodies F240 or T32 was observed. the epitopes of all tested anti-gp41-mAbs are shown in Figure 5A and Table S2. the serine variants of P4-7 and P6-2 lost their ability to compete for the binding target with the disulfide loop antibody F240. variant of the gp41 disulfide loop was tested. peptides or small molecules that mimic Env regions involved in these interactions are potential inhibitors of the formation of properly folded tertiary and quaternary Env structures. peptide fusion inhibitors resemble the gp41 NHR or CHR sequences. gp120-gp41 interaction is color coded in green and orange. mutagenesis studies and a recent crystal structure of gp120 suggest that the N- and C-termini of gp120 interact predominantly with the disulfide loop region. p120 that has been proposed to be involved in the gp120-gp41 interaction is located within the gp120 region that resembles the HIV-1-inhibitory N-terminal GBV-C E2 peptides. residues within the gp41 trimer are located near or within the epitopes of the antibodies T32 and F240 whose interaction with gp41 was disrupted by the E2 peptides P4-7 and P6-2. non-related viral glycoproteins E2GBV-C and gp120HIV, enables the E2 N-terminus to approach the gp120 binding site on gp41 that is believed to be the disulfide loop region. the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and HIV-1 gp120 share the same binding region within the gp41. the globular Ig-fold domain (residues 76\u2013195) is not predicted to adopt a globular three-dimensional structure. the N-terminus (residues 1\u201375), which is not predicted to adopt a globular three-dimensional structure, is schematically depicted as circles indicating the identity of the respective amino acids. E2-derived peptides do not alter CD4 or coreceptor surface expression. positive controls like PMA lead to down-regulation of CD4, SDF-1 (CXCR4-ligand) and RANTES (CCR5-ligand) to down-regulation of coreceptors. negative control P28 had no relevant effect on HIV-1 receptor presentation. the effect of antibodies that interfere with the initial CD4/gp120 interaction (b12 and B4) was largely abrogated under TAS conditions. the effect of antibodies that interfere with the initial CD4/gp120 interaction (b12 and B4) was largely abrogated. however, P4-7 and P6-2 showed full activity under both conditions. -cell fusion was determined from the ratio of blue (460 nm) and green (510 nm) emission upon exciting the cells at 405 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. percentages were calculated in relation to mock-treated cells. columns show average values SD of five independent experiments each performed in triplicate. 293T cells expressing CD4 were preincubated with soluble Fc-gp120 (HIV-1JRCSF) binding to CD4 was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FITC-conjugated anti-human pAb. the target of the HIV-1-inhibitory E2 peptides is most likely located on the HIV-1 particle, rather than on the cell. the surface of the HIV-1 particle consists of a lipid bilayer with incorporated host cell proteins and a limited number of functional envelope trimers (on average 147) [56]. percentages illustrate the increase of cell binding to X4env-transfected cells. the increase is normalized to the background binding of E2 peptides to mock-transfected cells. in gp41MN, the hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP), the transmembrane region (TM) and most of the C-terminal part of the cytoplasmic tail (CP) were omitted. the recombinant E2340-Fc protein was shown to interact with both gp41 variants in a dose-dependent manner. each sample was tested in triplicate. the statistical significance (p0.01) was achieved for all measure points (C34 vs. P28) peptide variants P4-7s and P6-2s lost ability to abrogate the E2-gp41 binding, suggesting that the cysteine residues within the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides play a crucial role for gp41 recognition. a competitive ELISA was performed to test whether the E2 peptides interact with either the NHR or CHR regions of gp41. the 6-HB-specific mAb NC-1 was used as a capture antibody [45] and the GBV-C E2 peptides were tested for competition with N36 and C34, respectively. neither P4-7 nor P6-2 was able to interfere with the formation of 6-HB, suggesting that the binding site of the E2 peptides is neither located in the NHR (N36) nor in the CHR (C34) regions of gp41. the serine variants of P4-7 and P6-2 lost their ability to compete for the binding target with the disulfide loop antibody F240 or were at least less efficient (T32). we immobilized via streptavidin an oxidized (closed loop) or a linear variant of the disulfide loop. the sequence stretches 33\u201346 and 54\u201370 of E2 exhibit sequence similarities of 85.7% and 76.5% to the N-terminus of gp120. the sequence stretches 33\u201346 and 54\u201370 of E2 exhibit sequence similarities of 85.7% and 76.5% to the N-terminus of gp120. p41 interaction (reviewed in [36]) is additionally shown in green. the disulfide-bonded loops that are recognized by the T32 antibody (residues 596\u2013612) are shown in red. the coordinates for structure presentations were taken from PDB entries 3JWD and 2EZO for gp120 and gp41, respectively. a gp120 peptide (N35, gp120 residue 31 to 65) should disturb the gp41 interaction. the gp41 affinity was more pronounced for N35 (IC500.7 M) than for the E2 peptides (IC50s: 7.0 M for P6-2 and 11.7 M for P4-7). we performed structure predictions and globularity analyses of the GBV-C E2 protein in order to get an idea whether the N-terminus of E2 is accessible to the interaction with HIV-1 Env involved in membrane fusion. the remaining extracellular part, in particular the N-terminal region including amino acids 1 to 75 that comprise the HIV-1-inhibitory domain, does not contain significant amounts of regular secondary structure. residues present in both peptides are shown in magenta. we have explored the molecular mechanism underlying the previously reported interference with HIV-1 entry by two overlapping peptides. this notion is evidenced by the observations that neither the cell surface expression of HIV-1 receptors, nor the binding of gp120 to CD4 and coreceptors appears to be affected. the sequence conservation is less pronounced for the more distantly related E2 proteins of GBV-C and HCV. the results of several experiments aimed at dissecting the E2-binding domain within gp41 suggest that E2 interacts with the gp41 disulfide loop region. the gp41 disulfide loop region structurally connects the NHR and CHR domains and contains two conserved cysteines. the gp41 transmembrane protein is expected to be at least partially buried in the trimeric gp41-gp120 structure [67]. the transient states of gp41 appear to be valid HIV-1 inhibitor targets. these inhibitors typically bind to the NHR or CHR regions during the prehairpin stage. the difference of action between cluster I antibodies and E2 peptides is an interesting question that needs further investigation. steric forces prevent globular antibodies to gain access to the gp41 disulfide loops at the right time, while peptides may have sufficient flexibility for this purpose. a recent crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp120 N- and C-termini revealed three topologically separate and structurally plastic layers. the conformational mobility of these layers together appears to be relevant for buffering movements of gp120 from gp41. chimeric peptides incorporate sequences of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 N-terminus of gp120 as a new approach to enhance the antiretroviral activity of disulfide loop-targeted peptide inhibitors. previously, Herrera et al. reported that peptides derived from the N-terminus of GBV-C E2 interact with the HIV-1 fusion peptide, resulting in suppression of HIV-1 replication. Xiang et al. proposes a new strategy of HIV-1 entry inhibition based on sequence resemblance between the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and HIV-1 gp120. results demonstrate that peptides targeting the gp41 disulfide loop are able to inhibit HIV-1 fusion. *Numbering follows HIV-1HXB2 gp160.
