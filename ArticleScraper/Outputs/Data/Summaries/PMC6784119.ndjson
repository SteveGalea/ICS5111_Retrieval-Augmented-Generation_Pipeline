{"summary": "MERS-CoV causes severe and lethal acute respiratory disease in humans. it is remarkably different from other human coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E, HCoVNL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. there are currently no licensed therapeutic drugs or prophylactic vaccines available to protect against MERS-CoV. ERS-CoV vaccine candidates include DNA vaccines [9,10,11], recombinant viral vectors [12,13,14,15,16,17,18], and protein-based platforms [6,19]. no vaccines have entered clinical trials except for a DNA vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials [20]. each of these different MERS-CoV vaccine approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA is a flexible, effective, inexpensive, and easy-to-handle alternative for heterologous proteins and peptides on GEM particles. the PA of the system surface display is the lysin motif (LysM) derived from the C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of AcmA, an autolysin from Lactococcus lactis. the fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind to GEM particles. the mucosal immunity and systemic immune responses were also detected through intranasal immunization in a mouse model. pFastBac1-RLP2, pFastBac1-RLP3 and pFastBac1-RP3 were then transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells to generate recombinant bacmids. then, the recombinant bacmids were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) insect GCACCATCCAACTTAGGGCAGACGCT-3\u2032 PA3-F 5\u2032-ACCAATAGCGTCTCTGCCCTAAGTTGGATGGTGCTTCTTCAGCTGG-3\u2032 Linker-PA2-F2 5\u2032-GGTGGTTCTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTG culture of cells infected with each recombinant baculovirus was centrifuged at 6000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. then the culture supernatants were obtained as supernatant fractions. cell pellets were washed three times with 10 mM PBS (pH 7.2\u20137.4) and then resuspended in PBS. binding GEM particles were concentrated at 6000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. resuspended in 5 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. then transferred by electroblotting onto PVDF transfer membranes. the amount of each fusion protein binding the GEM particles was determined densitometrically by analysis of scans of coomassie brilliant blue-stained SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. a calibration curve was generated using BSA protein standards on the same PAA gel. twenty mice were randomly distributed into four groups (n = 5 per group) and vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) mice in group 3 were vaccinated with 5 g RLP3-GEM antigen proteins. all groups were boosted twice with the same 3-week intervals. blood samples were collected at two, five and eight weeks wpi. purified RBD antigen produced in E.coli (1 g/mL) in 100 L carbonate buffer was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4 \u00b0C. after three wash cycles with PBST, the plates were incubated with the following HRP-labeled goat antibodies. splenocytes were harvested in complete RPMI 1640 medium at 7 days after third immunization. purified RBD antigen produced in E.coli was or was not added to each well at a final concentration of 10 g/mL to stimulate cytokine production. ELISA Measurement of Cytokine Levels in Splenocyte Culture Supernatants Splenocytes were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 and stimulated with RBD antigen (10 g/mL) produced in E.coli for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C. the agreement was approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine of the Military Academy of Sciences. the construction of rBV-RLP2, rBV-RLP3, and rBV-RP3 was as follows: MERS-CoV RBD genes encoding S glycoprotein residues 377-588 were amplified by PCR using codon-optimized S. pFastBac1-RLP2, pFastBac1-RLP3 and pFastBac1-RP3 were then transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells to generate recombinant bacmids. then, the recombinant bacmids were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) insect GGTGCTTCTTCAGCTGG-3\u2032 Linker-PA2-F2 5\u2032-GGTGGTTCTGTGGTTCTGTGTGGTACTACCGTTAAGTC-3\u2032 Linker-PA3-F2 5\u2032-GGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTG culture of cells infected with each recombinant baculovirus (rBV-RLP2, rBV-RLP3, rBV- RP3 and rBV) was centrifuged at 6000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. then the culture supernatants were obtained as supernatant fractions. cell pellets were washed three times with 10 mM PBS (pH 7.2\u20137.4) EM particles were concentrated at 6000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, washed and resuspended in sterile PBS, and stored at a concentration of 200 L/U at 20\u00b0C. the binding GEM particles were incubated with a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV-S polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. AGE was used to analyze each fusion protein binding the GEM particles. the amount of each fusion protein binding the GEM particles was determined densitometrically by analysis of scans of Coomassie brilliant blue-stained SDS\u201312% polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. mice in group 3 were vaccinated with 5 g RLP3-GEM antigen proteins mixed with 10 L GEL01 adjuvant. blood samples were collected at two, five and eight weeks wpi. serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min prior to analysis. purified RBD antigen produced in E.coli (1 g/mL) in 100 L carbonate buffer was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4 \u00b0C. after three wash cycles with PBST, the plates were incubated with the following HRP-labeled goat antibodies. purified RBD antigen produced in E.coli was or was not added to each well at a final concentration of 10 g/mL to stimulate cytokine production. after incubation for 40 h, IFN- and IL-4 were detected using mouse enzyme-linked immunospot kits according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cell samples were examined by a FACSAriaTM Cell Sorter. ELISA Measurement of Cytokine Levels in Splenocyte Culture Supernatants Splenocytes were harvested 7 days after the third immunization. RBD was fused to PA2 and PA3 with or without a linker. compared to control cells, the cells expressing RLP2, RLP3 and RP3 proteins emitted strong green fluorescence signals with an anti-MERS-S polyclonal antibody for RBD. expression was detected with a rabbit anti-MERS-S polyclonal antibody. surface location of RLP2, RLP3 and RP3 fusion proteins on GEM particles. GEM particles were bound with RLP2 (c), RLP3 (d), and RP3 (e) proteins. proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-MERS-S polyclonal antibody. direct binding capacity studies on GEM particles were performed. RP3 were selected for further experiments in mice. the antibody levels of the sera from the RLP3-GEM- and RP3-GEM-immunized mice gradually increased to plateau at eight weeks. serum samples were collected at weeks two, five, and eight. antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibodies in the serum. specific serum antibody levels were determined by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and ELISA. to decide whether the GEL01 could enhance the immune response of the RLP3-GEM in mice or not, we intranasally immunized mice. mucosal IgA levels were present among some of the tissues and organs in the RLP3-GEM and RLP3-GEM plus GEL01 groups. results showed that mucosal immune responses were induced by the adjuvant GEL01. 3.6. the expression of CD69+ on B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells significantly increased compared with the expression of cells from mice immunized with RLP3-GEM with GEL01. the results suggest that RLP3-GEM with GEL01 induced a more potent immune activation than did RLP3-GEM, which is very important to initiate the whole immune response. splenocytes secreted IFN-r (a) and IL-4 (b) in the splenocyte group. the concentrations of IFN-r (c), TNF-a (d), IL-2 (e), IL-4 (f), IL-6 (g) and IL-10 (h) in the supernatant were measured with commercial ELISA kits. rBV-RLP2 (h), rBV-RLP3 (i), rBV-RP3 (j) protein expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells was detected with a rabbit anti-MERS-S polyclonal antibody. the surface location of fusion proteins on GEM particles was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2a), Western blotting (Figure 2b) and IFA with an anti-MERS-S polyclon observations showed that the RLP2, RLP3 and RP3 fusion proteins were bound to GEM particles. compared to the GEM particles, the combination of the GEM particles and fusion proteins emitted a strong green fluorescence. 0.5 U GEM particles were combined with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mL of each recombinant baculovirus culture supernatant. the relative binding capacity of each fusion protein binding the GEM particles was detected densitometrically by analysis of scans of PAA gels. antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibodies in the serum were assessed by indirect ELISA with the purified RBD protein, displaying as the end-point dilution titers. the means SD and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. the neutralization titers of serum samples from mice immunized intramuscularly at the indicated times with RLP3-GEM and RP3-GEM+GEL01. -GEM plus GEL01 induced strong neutralization against an MERS-CoV infection. the latter showed a much higher neutralizing titer than the former. a similar phenomenon was also found for the RBD-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the sera at eight wpi caused by RLP3-GEM and RLP3-GEM plus GEL01. BD proteins, splenocytes harvested from mice intranasally immunized with RLP3-GEM plus GEL01 proliferated more efficiently than those from mice immunized with RLP3-GEM without GEL01. therefore, these data suggested that GEL01 could evoke potent antigen-specific immune responses. RLP3-GEM with GEL01 induced the secretion of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines, suggesting a stronger immune response than RLP3-GEM. splenocytes were harvested from mice immunized intranasally at 7 days after the last immunization. secreting IFN-r (a) and IL-4 (b) were quantified using an ELISpot assay. concentrations of IFN-r (c), TNF-a (d), IL-2 (e), IL-4 (f), IL-6 (g) and IL-10 (h) in the supernatant were measured with commercial ELISA kits. a novel method for surface display of an antigen is based on the nonrecombinant and nonliving Lactococcus lactis bacteria-assigned GEM particles. the particles can bind to exogenous antigens by a PA with a high affinity and a high loading capacity. it is easier to obtain purified antigens in a bacterium-like particles vaccine compared with the virus-like particles vaccine. in the wild, the number of LysM domains in the proteins differs greatly. the optimal number of LysM domains in the GEM-PA system for proper function are different in different groups. binding activity of RLP3 was remarkably higher than that of RLP2 in GEM particles. intranasal immunization with the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine is necessary. we used GEL01 as an adjuvant for intranasal vaccination. this is because GEL01 can enhance the protective effects of live vaccines through mucosal immunity. the results showed that the BLP vaccine could increase splenocyte proliferation. CD69 is an early marker of activated immune cells. a protective efficacy evaluation of the vaccine in animal models will be considered."}
