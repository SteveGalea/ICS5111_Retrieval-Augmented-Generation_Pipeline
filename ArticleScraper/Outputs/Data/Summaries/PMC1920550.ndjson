{"summary": "malaria causes more than 300 million acute clinical cases, and at least one million deaths annually. ninety percent of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan africa countries mostly among young children and pregnant women. the -helical coiled coil motif bears a characteristic seven amino acid residue repeat (abcdefg)n with hydrophobic residues located in a and d positions and hydrophilic residues generally elsewhere. this motif can be easily identified by bioinformatic analysis. in the same protein or in different ones, 95 were chemically synthesized and HPLC purified. the selected antigens were then tested in ELISA assays for reactivity with three panels of sera obtained from adult donors from burkina Faso, Tanzania and Colombia.

ELISA ELISA was performed according to Lopez et al. and anti human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as second antibody. individual human sera from 37, 42 and 39 adults donors from burkina faso, Tanzania and Colombia respectively were used at 1:200 dilution. antigen-sepharose beads were either used or stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS (1x) containing 1 mM azide. they were then washed with 5 mL of trizma base TRIS (20 mM containing 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0) then with 5 mL of TRIS (20 mM, pH 8.0) the fractions obtained were instantly neutralized with TRIS (1 M, pH 8.0), dialyzed against phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.0) the fractions obtained were instantly neutralized with TRIS (1 M, pH 8.0), dialyzed against phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.0) blood stage parasite cultures were synchronized by at least two successive sorbitol treatments followed, after maturation over 24 h, by floatation on 1% porcine skin gelatin type A (Sigma. cytapheresis samples were obtained from healthy blood donors with no previous history of malaria (Lecourbe Blood Bank, Paris, France) parasitemia was determined by light microscopy on Giemsa-stained smears. duplicate wells included the following controls. PIAG and N-IgG were used at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml respectively. (156KB, doc) Table S2 Cross-reactivity determination in ELISA among peptides tested in ADCI.
