{"summary": "the control efforts for SARS were slow to be mobilized and heavily criticized. the H7N9 response, 10 years later, was acknowledged to be much better. world health organization (WHO) and international scientific communities have been increased and strengthened. both diseases can lead to severe disease; there are still no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for them. both diseases presented a global epidemic and potential pandemic threat. stakeholders including officers from the WHO, food and agriculture organization of the united nations, national health and family planning

the outbreak was regarded as a public health emergency event in china in 2013. the CDC sequenced the genes of the virus on March 19, soon after the first confirmed case. all suspected cases in china were diagnosed by March 30, and the WHO was informed of all Chinese cases on March 31, 2013. compared to SARS, 10 years earlier, the government's response was more timely and transparent. there was a delay of 39 days from the treatment of the patient to the confirmation of the epidemic situation. some provincial health departments had said that Radix Isatidis could prevent H7N9 bird flu. but its true effectiveness had not been confirmed at the time. the health department received the Heyuan report on a local outbreak of unexplained pneumonia with certain infectivity. on the 2nd day, the investigation team wrote reports, identifying a local outbreak of unexplained pneumonia with certain infectivity. the same team leader wrote a report of the unexplained pneumonia survey in Zhongshan city on January 21. the central emergency leading group obtained timely and accurate epidemic prevention and control information. communication pathways between the government and the public were established and information collection was unobstructed outside the system. the poor handling of SARS exposed serious communication problems in the then emergency management system processes. the

patients had a history of recent exposure to poultry or a visit to a live poultry market. this risk factor was established early in the epidemic, and therefore an important measure was to close the live poultry trading markets. the information of the H7N9 was announced relatively promptly, so it was relatively smooth for us to do some work. compared to SARS, 10 years earlier, the government's response was more timely and transparent. but some problems and deficiencies in the epidemic prevention and control were identified. china's emergency management of the two epidemics of SARS in 2003 and H7N9 in 2013 varied. despite similarities of SARS and H7N9, mortality of H7N9 was much higher than SARS. the national government used the media to gain public support for the response. financial
