{"summary": "PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and high mortality in the piglets. most of newborn piglets infected by PEDV would die and pigs of all ages are also affected. there are no effective treatments or vaccines developed to prevent economic loss by PEDV. epimedium Koreanum Nakai contains flavonoids including Icariin, Icariside II, Epimedin, Epimedosides, Hyperoside, Qercetin, and Chlorogenic acid. the antiviral effect of Epimedium Koreanum Nakai was not reported until now. two strains of PED, KPEDV-9 and sm98 and other subtype TGE viruses were obtained from national veterinary research and quarantine service in Korea. 333 single medicinal herbal extracts were obtained from Yeongcheon Oriental Herbal Market (Yeongcheon, Korea) the supernatants harvested were serially diluted up to 106. the supernatants were added to vero cells seeded in 6 well. after 1 h incubation, media were removed from infected cells. the level of LDH released into the media is used as a marker of dead cells. cells seeded at 96 wells (3 104 cells/well) were incubated with diluted herbal extracts for 48 h. extract was added up to 0.6% of diet after 24 h and 48 h of virus inoculation and at necropsy. feces of control or KIOM 198-dieted piglets were visually observed. the mobile phase composed of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) the run time was 70 min and the mobile phase program was the gradient elution as follows: 10% B (0\u20135 min), 10\u201340% B (5\u201360 min), and 40% (60\u201370 min) two strains of PED, KPEDV-9 and sm98 and other subtype TGE viruses were obtained from KCLB, Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Republic of Korea) two strains of PED, KPEDV-9 and sm98 and other subtype TGE viruses were obtained from national veterinary research and quarantine service in Korea. OM 124 was 20-fold diluted (1.5 mg/mL) and added to the vero cells. the mixture was further incubated for 48 h or 72 h until cytopathic effect formation. the supernatants were harvested and used for determining virus yield. PCR was performed using Bio-Rad iQ5 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) the primer sequences specific for Nucleocapsid gene of PED virus are used for PCR. the level of LDH released into the media is used as a marker of dead cells. the formazan melted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was determined with absorbance at 570 nm. feces of control or KIOM 198-dieted piglets were visually observed. the powdered Epimedium Koreanum Nakai 50 mg was dissolved at the concentration of 50 mg/mL in methanol. the sample solution was filtered through a 0.45 m PVDF membrane filter. the output signal of the detector was recorded using waters Empower 1.0 software system. 333 different oriental herbal medicines were infected with 1 MOI of PED for 1 h. each herbal extract was 20-fold diluted and then added to the mixture. KIOM 124 and KIOM 198 showed significant antiviral activity. KIOM 124 and KIOM 198 were more investigated to confirm the antiviral activity. the control cells infected with virus exhibited partial CPE at 48 h postinfection and full CPE at 72 h postinfection. KIOM 198 exerts strong inhibitory effect on PED viral replication. KIOM 198 strongly repressed viral replication at 18 h and 24 h postinfection. the plaque formation was repressed 10\u201340 fold by KIOM 124 and 104 fold by KIOM 198. KIOM 198 contains much stronger antiviral activity on viral propagation. 198, other subtype sm98 and TGE viruses were used for antiviral activity test. at 48 h or 72 h postinfection, most cells were lysed by viral propagation. at 24 h postinfection, KIOM 198 inhibited a little CPE by viral propagation. the extent of cytotoxicity of KIOM 198 is close to nothing, compared to other herbal extracts. the data suggest KIOM 198 could be a safe and nontoxic drug when used for antiviral therapy. KIOM 198-dieted piglets were orally injected with or without KIOM 198. after 24 h and 48 h, the feces of control or KIOM 198-dieted piglets were observed. vero cells were infected with 1 MOI of PED for 1 h. each herbal extract was 20-fold diluted and then added to the mixture. at 72 h or 96 h post-incubation, each supernatant having virus was collected. cells preinfected with virus at an MOI of 0.1 were treated with KIOM 124 or KIOM 198 and incubated for 18 h and 24 h. KIOM 198 strongly repressed viral replication at 18 h and 24 h postinfection. diluted KIOM 124 or KIOM 198 herbal extract. at 18 h, 24 h, and 48 h postinfection, each supernatant was collected. each supernatant was serially diluted for titration. with sm98 virus at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 h and added with 20-fold diluted KIOM 198 extract. incubated with KIOM 198 for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. antiviral activity test showed KIOM 198 has a remarkable ability to inhibit coronavirus propagation. piglets fed with milk and KIOM 198 had normal feces, whereas control piglets had diarrhea. no virus was detected in the feces of piglets dieted with KIOM 198 at 24 h postinfection. from 48 h postinfection, viral number in the piglets was increased. KIOM 198 exhibited antiviral activity on not only PED virus but other corona virus. each compound at concentration of 100 g/mL was treated to the Vero cells infected with PED virus. antiviral activity of KIOM 198 was confirmed in vivo disease model. piglets infected with KIOM 198 expressed disease symptoms like diarrhea. piglets oral-administered with KIOM 198 had normal feces. this result suggests the antiviral effect of KIOM 198 on the virus is very effective in the early stage. KIOM 198 exerts strong antiviral effect through modulating immune response such as macrophage."}
