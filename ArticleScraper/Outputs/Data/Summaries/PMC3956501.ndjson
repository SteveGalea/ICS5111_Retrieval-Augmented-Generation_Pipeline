{"summary": "microbes are beneficial for the human body, while others can be pathogenic. intestinal mucosa is one of the largest interfaces of the human body. many bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause dangerous infections especially under conditions that favor their growth and survival. the conserved Tom complex-mediated host defenses show specificity against C. caviae, but not against C. trachomatis12 Enterobacter cloacae. the latter contributes to stem cell proliferation and epithelial renewal. some bacterial effectors are required for full infectivity of Drosophila cells only in specific host genetic backgrounds. some bacterial effectors are required for full infectivity of Drosophila cells only in specific host genetic backgrounds. -P. aeruginosa modulates host defense responses in a tissue-dependent manner and may contribute to epithelial inflammation and cancer. there is an inverse correlation between biofilm formation and acute virulence. cholera toxin may act in parallel with Cl secretion to drive pathophysiology of cholera. flies are more resistant to RNA virus infections in flies. L. plantarum colonization is induced by PON1 and does not induce PGRP-LE mediated defense response. screens in flies identify host autophagy and bacterial factors required for resistance and susceptibility to L. monocytogenes infection. Beauveria bassiana -Inhibits the activity of phenol oxidases, which are the main melanization enzymes85 -Cold stress increases resistance to B. bassiana infection. 85 -Female Wolbachia-infected flies are more resistant to B. bassiana infection. anisopliae PR1A triggers the expression of Drosomycin in psh-dependent manner97 Pneumocystis (P. murina, P.carinii, and P. jirovecii) -P. murina and P. carinii are rodent pathogens -Toll-deficient flies are resistant to infection with Pneumocystis spp.98. 105,106 Flock house virus (FHV) -Induces apoptosis of Drosophila Line-1 cells by depleting Drosophila Inhibitor-of-Apoptosis protein DIAP1.108 -Viral siRNAs might cause FHV persistent infections. 120-122 Sigma virus (SIGMAV) -Induces expression of the peptidoglycan receptor protein genes PGRP-SB1 and PGRP-SD. some, but not all, AMP genes104 -Toll and Imd signaling are not significantly induced by Sigma virus infection104. human microbes studied during interaction with Drosophila in wound (thoracic pricking), systemic (hemolymph injection), or intestinal infection assays. microbial virulence factors have been expressed in live Drosophila tissues or Drosophila tissue culture cells have been studied upon infection with various human microbes. flies are amenable to anti-infective treatments and a great number of genetic tools based on the genome are now available. many microbes have been studied in fruit flies, including many important human-related microbes. the method of thoracic or abdominal needle pricking involves the use of a metal needle dipped into a bacterial suspension. the bacteria may proliferate locally and disseminate throughout the body of the fly, leading to both local and systemic tissue damage and immune response. Drosophila studies describe mechanisms of pathogenesis as potential targets against human pathogens. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses are grouped in separate subsections for systematic purposes. 249 mutant strains of F. tularensis subsp. novicida, potentially relevant to mammalian cell pathogenesis, were tested in adult flies. this subspecies is attenuated in virulence in mammals yet lethal to flies. Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of peptic ulcers, atrophic gastridis and gastric carcinoma. Virulent strains can inject the CagA effector protein into the host cells. expression of this virulence factor promotes apoptosis or tumorigenesis. mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium fortuitum M. marinum cause human skin infections that may spread deeper. infected flies undergo a \u201cwasting\u201d process characterized by hyperglycemia and the loss of metabolic stores. this process is partially induced by the transcription factor FOXO, which nevertheless does not affect bacterial load. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major agent of lethal infections in cystic and burn wound patients. many of its virulence factors show exceptional conservation by contributing to pathogenesis in flies and mice. P. aeruginosa actively limits expression of Drosophila skeletal muscle genes at the site of wound infection and the expression of glutathione-S-transferase S1 (GstS1) in flies. this wound site response is a resistance mechanism that inhibits bacterial growth and dissemination. Salmonella Typhimurium is highly virulent due to its many virulence factors. it can cause inflammatory diarrhea (gastroenteritis) in calves and humans. expression of AvrA in Drosophila suppresses apoptosis by inhibiting the JNK pathway. serratia marcescens is an entomopathogenic bacterium. it is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections with high mortality rates. it is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections with high mortality rates. vibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of cholera, a life-threatening diarrheal disease. cholerae polysaccharide (VPS)-dependent biofilm is highly activated upon entry into the arthropod intestine. intestinal infection of D. melanogaster mimics to a great extent the human disease cholera. Bacillus anthracis Bacillus anthracis is the etiological agent of anthrax. it can infect many mammals, including humans. flies contain ergosteror instead of cholesterol in their cell membranes. faecalis activates phagocytosis in addition to the antimicrobial peptide production in Drosophila. faecalis quorum regulatory system genes LrgAB and SprE, and bacteriocin EF1097 were found to contribute to infection toxicity in Drosophila. L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum appear to have evolved the ability to induce cellular ROS and intestinal generation within their host. p38 MAPK-dependent phagocytic encapsulation resulted in enlarged phagocytes that trap L. monocytogenes conferring tolerance to infection. flies infected with L. monocytogenes exhibit a shift in their metabolism manifested primarily as changes in their lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid levels. genetic screens in Drosophila identify host autophagy, phagocytosis, and bacterial factors required for resistance and tolerance to L. monocytogenes infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that can cause serious pathologies. flies injected with 3000 bacterial cells into the hemolymph are usually killed within 2 d. flies challenged with a lethal dose after being primed with heat-killed bacteria resist infection. toll pathway is required in Drosophila to respond to A. fumigatus infection. fungus is lethal to wild-type flies,83,185. combinatorial treatments with voricanazole and terbinafine have a synergistic effect against infection. Candida pathogens secrete aspartyl proteinases (SAPs) which are critical molecules that allow them to degrade barrier tissues by hydrolysing proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and keratin. the secretion of SAP4 and SAP6 from Candida is necessary for the activation of systemic toll-dependent immunity. cunninghamella bertholletiae and Rhizopus oryzae are filamentous fungi that cause invasive mucormycosis. virulence of C. bertholletiae isolates is affected by iron content the nutrient media in which fungi grow. corticosteroid drugs and deferoxamide that affect iron availability in the host also affect wild-type Drosophila infection with C. bertholletiae. Drosophila is a model host system for identifying human genes, such as tumor suppressors that are targeted by BRLF1 and are relevant to EBV-mediated tumorigenesis. many Drosophila genes with known human homologs are required for the EBV replication. virus able to replicate in Drosophila cells 3 genes and their human homologs were found to control viral replication. expression of the influenza virus M2 gene in Drosophila led to the identification of V1V0 ATPase as a potentiator of M2-mediated aberrant cell development to the host cell. Sindbis virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that can cause fever, arthralgia and rush in humans. natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) is used by SINV to enter Drosophila cells in culture and in adult flies. flies deficient for Toll-7 are more susceptible to VSV infection. other studies in both adult flies and Drosophila S2 cells also show that activation of autophagy in Drosophila decreases the replication of VSV.190 Conclusion: Toll-7 induces autophagy to suppress VSV infection in an NFB-independent manner. flies mutants for eiger, the Drosophila TNF homolog, die faster than wild type flies when injected with B. cepacia. melanization seems to reduce the ability of bacteria to grow. but also reduces the tolerance of flies to Bcc infection. sis subsp. novicida, potentially relevant to mammalian cell pathogenesis, was tested in adult flies. 20 percent of genes tested in mice also contributed to adult fly pathogenesis. Drosophila transgenic models show that CagA activates myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) leading to the rapid disruption of epithelial integrity. the bacteria direct the formation of their replication vacuole by injecting many effector proteins into the host cells. infection with M. marinum does not induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides by Drosophila. infection with M. marinum does not induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides by Drosophila. aeruginosa redox-active phenazine pyocyanin induces Drosophila intestinal stem cells overproliferation as a defense response to infection. transgenic flies expressing PON1 are more resistant to P. aeruginosa wound infection because PON1 can neutralize the quorum sensing regulator LasI. formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms correlates negatively with the virulence of the different strains. mutants with decreased biofilm formation are significantly more virulent than hyperbiofilm strains. pleiotropy may be a mechanism for the observed correlation. avrA was found suppressing innate immune response and inflammation in the mouse intestine. anorexia in turn increases the fly\u2019s tolerance to S. Typhimurium infection. flies lacking the gene subdued accumulate more bacteria and succumb faster than wild-type flies upon S. marcescens oral infection. a genome-wide in vivo infected flies identified the JAK-STAT pathway as an important inducer of intestinal regeneration. lanogaster with V. cholera mimics to a great extent the human disease cholera. mutations in the pro-apoptotic Eiger/TNF signaling pathway increase the susceptibility of the fly to V. cholerae infection. mutant flies for eiger, the Drosophila TNF homolog, die faster than wild type flies when injected with B. cepacia. melanization seems to reduce the ability of bacteria to grow (increases resistance) in flies, but also reduces the tolerance of flies to Bcc infection, presumably because melanization induces immunopathology. twenty percent of genes tested in mice also contributed to adult fly pathogenesis. virulence factors resist oxidative stress and counteract the melanization that Drosophila uses as an immune response to infection. models show that CagA activates myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) leading to rapid disruption of epithelial integrity. orthotopic activation of CagA in Drosophila stomach like tissues might be recommended to validate these mechanisms of action. Legionella pneumophila L. pneumophila can cause severe pneumonia in humans called Legionnaire disease. infection with M. marinum does not induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides by Drosophila. infection with M. marinum does not induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides by Drosophila. transgenic flies expressing Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) are more resistant to P. aeruginosa wound infection. in a wound infection model, transgenic flies expressing PON1 are more resistant to P. aeruginosa wound infection. mutants with decreased biofilm formation are significantly more virulent than hyperbiofilm strains. the former disseminate more easily to the fly hemolymph and immune response is decreased, facilitating the progression of infection. the P. aeruginosa\u2013fly model has still many aspects of infection to teach us. anorexia increases the fly\u2019s tolerance to S. Typhimurium infection. eiger mutant flies survive the infection better because they are anorexic. the relationship between diet restriction and host defense is not universal. flies lacking the gene subdued accumulate more bacteria and succumb faster than wild-type flies upon S. marcescens oral infection. phagocytosis and NFB pathway-induced intestinal regeneration appears to exacerbate infection. mutations in the pro-apoptotic Eiger/TNF signaling pathway increase the susceptibility of the fly to V. cholerae infection. mutations in the pro-apoptotic Eiger/TNF signaling pathway increase the susceptibility of the fly to V. cholerae infection. the role of LF and EF in endocytosis proved to be conserved in a human cell line. another Bacillus anthracis-secreted factor the hemolytic protein anthrolysin O binds and kills mouse and human macrophage-like. L. plantarum can colonize germ-free Drosophila larval gut and remains associated with it long after the initial colonization. PGRP-LE senses entomopathogenic Erwinia carotovora and induces the Imd/NFB pathway to defend the host from infection. listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic anaerobic intracellular pathogen that causes listeriosis. flies infected with L. monocytogenes exhibit a shift in their metabolism manifest primarily as changes in their lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid levels. d-alanylated wall teichoic acid binds covalently to peptidoglycan. flies injected with 3000 bacterial cells into the hemolymph are usually killed within 2 d. flies infected with S. pneumoniae lose circadian rhythm several days before dying. survival during a L. monocytogenes infection is determined by phagocytosis and melanization. only phagocytosis determines survival during a S. pneumoniae infection. Enterococcus faecalis Enterococci, including E. faecalis, are commensal organisms of the gastrointestinal tract. E. faecalis strains that express the virulence factor cytolysin are significantly more virulent to both flies and mammals. entomopathogenic Erwinia carotovora induces the Imd/NFB pathway to defend the host from infection. colonization with L. plantarum protects the fly from virulent P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens oral infection. flies infected with L. monocytogenes exhibit a shift in their metabolism manifested primarily as changes in their lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid levels. genetic screens in Drosophila identify host autophagy, phagocytosis, and bacterial factors required for resistance and tolerance to infection. d-alanylated wall teichoic acid binds covalently to peptidoglycan. flies injected with 3000 bacterial cells into the hemolymph are usually killed within 2 d. fungi Aspergillus fumigatus A. fumigatus is the major cause of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals and adult flies. virulence of A. fumigatus has a multifactorial nature. pathogenicity of C. albicans can be studied by systemically infecting toll-deficient flies or by feeding wild-type Drosophila larvae. pathogenicity of C. albicans can be studied by systemically infecting toll-deficient flies or by feeding wild-type Drosophila larvae. tarcolimus and posaconazole have been shown to have combinatorial efficacy against R. oryzae in flies and mice. tarcolimus and posaconazole show promise in combinatorial treatments against R. oryzae. the pathogenicity of C. albicans can be studied by systemically infecting Toll-deficient flies or by feeding wild-type Drosophila larvae. the pathogenicity of C. albicans can be studied by systemically infecting Toll-deficient flies or by feeding wild-type Drosophila larvae. 143,144 Drosophila intestinal infection with C. albicans results in an extensive JNK-mediated death of gut cells and the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the fat body. Candida pathogens secrete aspartyl proteinases (SAPs) which are critical molecules that allow them to degrade barrier tissues by hydrolysing proteins such as collagen. alternative routes of infection reveal existence of intestinal defense pathways other than the Imd and Toll as critical for host defense. host cell autophagy contributes to pathogenesis. a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila cells identified candidate host factors implicated in the propagation of DENV. eighty-two of these have human homologs, while 42 previously known to affect virus replication in human cells. influenza virus Influenza is caused by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. it is highly contagious and sometimes deadly. adapted virus for growth in Drosophila cells facilitates identification of host genes that affect influenza A virus replication. cuolating virus 40 belongs to the family of DNA tumor viruses. such viruses induce host cell proliferation in order to promote replication. the interaction of tumor antigen ST with PF2A and the concomitant centromere duplication may drive oncogenesis by SV40. recognition of this single stranded RNA virus by the Drosophila pattern recognition receptor Toll-7, similarly to mammalian TLR7,130 results in the activation of antiviral autophagy. flies deficient for Toll-7 are more susceptible to VSV infection. a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila cells identified candidate host factors implicated in the propagation of DENV. eighty-two of these have human homologs, while 42 previously known to affect virus replication in human cells. Vpu expression in the Drosophila wing primordia triggers apoptosis via JNK pathway signaling. thus orthotopic expression of viral proteins in immune cells might be required for the study of responses elicited by Vpu. Drosophila transgenic models of SARS-CoV indicate genetic interactions of the viral apoptotic proteins 3a and M with cytochrome c. such viruses induce host cell proliferation in order to promote their replication. ERK pathway induction is pivotal for Drosophila and mosquito host intestinal defense. flies deficient for Toll-7 are more susceptible to VSV infection. flies deficient for Toll-7 are more susceptible to VSV infection. a gold standard in studying human pathogens in flies is to verify findings in mammalian models of infection. a gold standard in studying human pathogens in flies is to verify findings in mammalian models. flies can be killed even by bacterial strains considered nonpathogenic in mammals. pathogenicity cannot be studied and alternative modes of infection should be tried. microbes that do not inflict disease in wild type or even in immunocompromised flies can still be studied if their virulence factors are genetically expressed preferentially orthotopically in fly tissues homologous to those relevant to human pathophysiology. despite rough guidelines, there is no strict formula of success in modeling human disease in flies."}
