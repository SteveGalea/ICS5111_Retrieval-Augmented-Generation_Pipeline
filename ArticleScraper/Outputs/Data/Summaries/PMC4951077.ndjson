{"summary": "a broad panel of respiratory viruses have been studied in children with respiratory tract infection (RTI) but less knowledge exists about viruses in asymptomatic children. we have studied 161 children in two day-care centers during four autumn and winter visits over a two-year period. the use of sensitive molecular tests has shown that several respiratory viruses frequently been detected in children who need hospitalization for respiratory tract infection (RTI). it has also been documented that children hospitalized with RTI often have multiple viruses, and that asymptomatic hospital controls may frequently be positive for respiratory viruses. in total, 161 children participated in the study one or more times. majority of included children were both sampled by a nasopharyngeal sample (NPS) and underwent clinical examination. some resisted the collection of NPS or clinical examination after inclusion. PCRs were in-house, real-time assays with TaqMan probes. the amount of virus in each sample was recorded semi-quantitatively. Ct-values above 40 were regarded as virus-negative. the null distribution was conditional on the distribution of pathogens among day-care sections and sampling times. hope\u2019s test was further used to test in pairs whether the three most common pathogens, HEV, HPeV and HRV, occurred independently of each other. 95% of all toddlers and preschool children in the city of Trondheim attended day care during the study period. the number of children in the two day-care centers varied from 110 to 132 at each visit. the majority of included children was both sampled by a nasopharyngeal sample and underwent clinical examination. the study was approved by the regional committee for medical and health research ethics, mid-norway, Norway. the number of included children during each of four study visits and the number of children being sampled one, two, three or four times. the 2 or a Fisher\u2019s Exact Test were used to compare differences in proportions. the test compared the observed distribution of the number of pathogens in a nasopharyngeal sample. the test compared the observed distribution of the number of pathogens in a nasopharyngeal sample. model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). the same approach was followed in order to study whether clinical findings were related to the occurrence of HRV. day-care sections and sampling times (seasons) were again included as random explanatory variables. nasopharyngeal samples were collected at four different sampling times. one virus was detected in 31% (106/343) of the NPS. two or more viruses were detected in 12% (43/343). nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) for human enterovirus (A), human parechovirus (HPeV) (B) and human rhinovirus (HRV) (C) at four different study visits. one of the young children sections was not sampled in November 2013 and February 2014. one or more viruses were detected in 55% (83/152) of the NPS from sections with young children. the presence of HRV was not related to the age of the children. compared to the HEV and HPeV positives, the HRV positives had a higher median age of 35.5 months (IQR 21.0\u201354.0) 0.489 Premature 36 GA 11 (12) 8 (7) 4 (6) 0.342 Siblings 1 79 (86) 83 (73) 42 (66) 0.010 Pets 24 (26) 25 (22) 12 (19) 0.546 1 parents smoking 9 (10) 11 (10) 7 (11) 0.959 Vaccination 92 (100) 114 (100) 63 (98) NA Antibiotic treatment last 6 months 4 (4) 16 (14) 7 (11) 0.068 >4 upper RTI per year HRV was the most frequently detected virus in all clinical groups, varying from 41% (32/79) in the clear RTI group, to 24% (32/135) in the mild group, and 18% (21/117) in children without a RTI (p = 0.001) the Ct-values for HRV in NPS were not significantly different between the groups.

MV, multiple viruses, with 2 viruses. picornaviruses were the most frequently detected viruses during all four sampling times. one out of four visits to the day-care centers occurred during a RSV epidemic. however, it may be possible that RSV more often causes severe disease and sick leave from day care. HRV was detected at every sampling time, and was the most common virus. children with HRV-positive NPS had increased probability of a clear RTI. however, we also detected HRV in nearly one-fifth of the children without clinical findings of a RTI. infected with HPeV1 (83%) and HPeV2 (91%) before the age of five years. in the present study, HPeV and HEV were often detected in the same children, attending sections for young children. this co-variation eliminated our possibility to prove that HPeV and HEV were actually related to RTI among the youngest children. symptoms are not entirely accurate in predicting an upper RTI in children. each study visit was performed three-12 months apart, which is a long time from an epidemic and clinical perspective. this study showed that 43% of apparently healthy children attending day care had one or more viruses in NPS."}
