{"summary": "genus flavivirus contains more than 90 RNA-enveloped viruses out of which 30 can cause severe disease in humans and animals. most members of the family are arthropod-borne and are transmitted to the host by mosquitos or ticks. viruses responsible for causing ocular manifestations are shown in green. ocular tissue pathology is highlighted in red. flaviviruses are a family of lipid-enveloped viruses with ocular cells. a single-stranded 10.5 kb positive-sense RNA genome encodes only ten proteins. most viral proteins associate with host cellular functions and metabolic pathways. the virus is introduced into the host by an infected vector during its blood meal. flaviviruses are a family of lipid-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded 10.5 kb positive-sense RNA genome. the virus is introduced into the host by an infected vector (e.g., mosquito) during its blood meal. the non-structural proteins are involved in viral genome replication, budding, and deploying the host cell machinery. viral RNA is packaged with structural proteins\u2014C, E, and prM. the mature virus is then released from the host via exocytosis into the extracellular space via exocytosis (8, 9) studies of flaviviruses and their role in ocular diseases are limited. ocular symptoms range from maculopathy to retinal hemorrhage and vision loss. a more rigorous understanding of ocular symptoms can range from maculopathy to retinal hemorrhage. zika Virus fever, fever, hemorrhagic pneumonitis, hepatomegaly and parenchymatic degeneration, nephrosis, characteristic reticulo-endothelial cells in spleen and liver along with leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, reduced red blood cells, bradycardia, meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic fever manifestations, coma, mental disturbance, gidd conjunctivitis, muscle pain may result in Guillain-Barre syndrome, microcephaly, hearing loss, seizures, impaired joint movement, retinal hemorrhaging, retinal mottling, optic neuritis. severe YF is pan-systemic viral sepsis with viremia, fever, prostration, hepatic, renal and myocardial injury, hemorrhage, shock and lethality up to 20\u201350%. the infection rate of YFV has rapidly declined due to the successful development of two attenuated vaccines during the 1930\u20131940s. the present risk of emergence and transmission of the disease is being controlled by wide coverage of vulnerable populations with vaccinations. there is only a single case study on a 21-year-old woman traveling to africa who suffered from irreversible loss of vision. there has been a drastic reduction in the occurrence of JEV induced encephalitis cases since the use of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for humans [48] there has been only a single case study published on a 53-year-old woman infected with JEV leading to blurred vision with retinal hemorrhage. the second non-viremic phase may include bradycardia, meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic fever manifestations, conjunctival inflammation, coma and neurological complications. there are around 400\u2013500 cases reported annually during the past five decades. there are no experimental models to study its pathogenesis. the ocular involvement following WNV infection was first reported during 2002\u20132003 with chorioretinitis, anterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuritis, and congenital chorioretinal scarring. around 80% of patients with neurological complications suffered from multifocal chorioretinitis without any ocular symptoms or vaguely reduced vision. the exact mechanisms related to optic neuropathy related to WNV are still unknown. a severe form of dengue may be lethal to individuals with bleeding gums, restlessness, fatigue, blood in vomit, and thrombocytopenia. the viral NS1 protein is secreted from the cells and stays in the blood circulation of patients even after the fever and viral nucleic acid subside. at the time when severe dengue hemorrhage begins, NS1 protein levels correlate well with the degree of thrombocytopenia. ocular pathology in dengue fever was thought to be uncommon; however, its involvement of ocular complications is now being recognized increasingly as it leads to permanent visual impairment. there have been very few studies to understand the mechanism behind dengue-induced ocular implications. there is only one study relating maculopathy to be serotype specific with DENV-1 epidemic causing 10% incidence while there were no cases during DENV-2 epidemic. the serious threat to vision is dengue retinopathy, including retinal vasculopathy. ofi Pasteur has been approved for use in individuals above the age of 9 years in Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. the virus was first isolated from a rhesus macaque from the Zika forest in 1947 [72], with its first human detection in 1952 [72,73], with its first human detection in 1952 [72,73], with its first human detection in 1952 [72,73], with its first human detection in 1952 [72,73]. in 2007 a ZIKV epidemic on Ya there has been a steep increase in reported cases in the pathology of ocular complication in CZS. there have also been reports of chorioretinal atrophy, optic neuritis, retinal hemorrhaging, retinal mottling, iris coloboma, lens subluxation, gross macular pigment mottling, optic nerve hyperplasia, macular chorioretinal atrophy. severe YF is pan-systemic viral sepsis with viremia, fever, prostration, hepatic, renal and myocardial injury, hemorrhage, shock and lethality up to 20\u201350%. infections in humans range from unapparent abortive infection to a fatal, fulminating disease with high fever, vomiting, epigastric pain, prostration, and dehydration. the infection rate of YFV has rapidly declined due to a 21-year-old woman traveler to africa suffered from irreversible loss of vision along with optic neuritis and encephalitis upon receiving vaccinations for yellow fever, hepatitis A, and B. the causal factor among the multiple vaccines could not be resolved during the investigation. the involvement of YFV in causing ocular complications is still unclear. only a single case study has been published on a 53-year-old woman infected with JEV leading to blurred vision with retinal hemorrhage. in vitro studies on JEV have shown that virus infection leads to the production of a macrophage-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor. it alters the blood-retinal barrier and thereby might have been a cause for the observed retinal hemorrhage. there are around 400\u2013500 cases reported annually during the past five decades. the ophthalmic presentation of KFDV includes hemorrhages in the conjunctiva, vitreous humor, and retina, mild iritis, the opacity of lens and keratitis. a prospective case study in india revealed 70% of positive cases with WNV infection reported additional ocular complications apart from what was initially reported. the fundus examination revealed discrete superficial white retinitis, arteritis, phlebitis, and retinal hemorrhages with or without a macular star. the symptoms during dengue fever usually include high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and rash. a severe form of dengue may be lethal to individuals with symptoms including bleeding gums, restlessness, fatigue, blood in vomit, and thrombocytopenia. dengue eye disease can be unilateral or bilateral and onset of ocular symptoms range from 2 to 5 days after the onset of fever. most ocular symptoms have been noted within one day after the peak of thrombocytopenia [27] one study reported that 10% of 160 DENV seropositive hospitalized patients had maculopathy. the serious threat to vision is dengue retinopathy, including retinal vasculopathy and macular edema. observations in patients implicate the involvement of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and endothelial cells. the infection decreased the epithelial barrier integrity while the endothelial junctions were intact. in more than 70 countries causing severe deformities in newborns and neurological diseases in adults. 80% of infected adults remain asymptomatic. symptoms include fever, rash, headache, joint pain, conjunctivitis, muscle pain. chorioretinal atrophy in other reported CZS cases. chorioretinal abnormalities were also reported without microcephaly indicating the capability of ZIKV to cause ocular complications by direct infection. the first model of ocular complication during ZIKV infection in mice was described by miner et al.. there were no histological abnormalities evident in the eyes of congenitally infected IFNAR+/ fetuses from C57BL/6 IFNAR1/ dams. studies show the ability of ZIKV to infect previously unexplored cell types of the eye. the virus could reach the fetal circulation from the placenta and infect the RPE, retinal endothelial cells, and the retina. other possible pathway would be through axonal transport into the eye. the field of ZIKV research has been undecided on the role of the protein tyrosine kinase TAM receptors in the retinal epithelial and endothelial primary cells during ZIKV infection. the wild-type C57BL/6, BALB/c, and CD-1 mice are resistant to flavivirus infections. a successful mouse model showed ocular infections mimicking humans. the model showed presence of virus in the ocular tissues till 30 days pi. the model showed presence of virus in the ocular tissues till 30 days pi. type mice are not susceptible to ZIKV, most in vitro studies have used primary human cells or established cell lines. the retinal cell types lining the BRB are susceptible to ZIKV infection and cause cell death by activating Caspase 3. the outer BRB is limited internally by tight junctions between endothelial cells underlining the retinal capillaries. the outer barrier is formed of tight junctions between the cells of the RPE, separating the choroid system from the sensory retina. the development and maintenance of the BRB is needed for healthy vision and the loss of the BRB leads to the pathology of a variety of retinal diseases. othelial cells and pericytes and the virus enter the outer BRB via the choroid capillaries. the cells are multi-functional and help in transport of nutrients and waste from the retina across the choroid and impart adhesive properties to the retina. the cells have been identified as an ideal target for infectious agents such as Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Coronavirus, Zika virus. microbial infections cause chorioretinal atrophy, chorioretinal atrophy, chorioretinal atrophy and cell death. infection leads to increased levels of granzyme B, perforin, IFN and IFN stimulated genes. cytotoxic T cells remained in the eyes along with expression of several chemokines. the cornea and retina had higher levels of chemokines associated with the infiltration of CD45+ cells along with biomarkers for APCs (CD86, B2m, H2-EB1) and T-cell infiltration (CD3, CD4, GITR, CD40L, Fas-L) causing increased cytotoxicity in the infected tissues. Singh et al. performed meta-analysis of ZIKV infected RPE cells. a 43 genes signature referred to as core signature genes are dysregulated upon ZIKV infection and not by the other flaviviruses tested. lipid metabolism machinery is centrally controlled by AMPK (5\u2019 AMP activated protein kinase), one of the master regulators of various cellular metabolic pathways. AMPK has a prominent role during bacterial endophthalmitis with its activation by pharmacological drugs leading to a significant decrease in bacterial load in the infected eyes. the exact mechanisms of how the RPE cells participate in the regulation of the blood-retinal barrier remain largely unknown. the retina also contains specialized myeloid cells (microglia), similar to brain microglia and the central and peripheral rims of the retina contain a small population of DCIR+ MHC Class IIhi DCs. inflammatory genes TNFA, IL1B, CXCL10, CCL5 lead to ocular inflammation. the infection also leads to elevated levels of granzyme B, perforin, IFN and IFN stimulated genes. the infection also leads to elevated levels of granzyme B, perforin, IFN and IFN stimulated genes. the flaviviruses are known to subvert cholesterol homeostasis using multiple mechanisms to transform lipid droplets into their replication complexes with host membranes. the flaviviruses are known to subvert cholesterol homeostasis using multiple mechanisms to transform lipid droplets into their replication complexes. lipid metabolism machinery is centrally controlled by AMPK (5\u2019 AMP activated protein kinase), one of the master regulators of various cellular metabolic pathways.
