{"summary": "approximately 180 million people have been infected with the hepatitis C virus. approximately 130 million people are chronic HCV carriers. hepatitis C is a common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (2\u20134) reagents and instruments included goat anti-mouse HCV IgG polyclonal antibody, 30\u201360 nm colloidal gold particles, a nanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, a Bio-Rad BioLogic LP, ZQ4000 test strip cutter, and XYZ-3000 Bio-Dot. sequences encoding the desired regions in the HCV genome were amplified by RT-PCR. harvested bacteria were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 140 mmol/l NaCl, 2.7 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmol/l KH2PO4, pH 7.3. after centrifugation, the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of expression products.

Rice. reagents and instruments included goat anti-mouse HCV IgG polyclonal antibody, 30\u201360 nm colloidal gold particles, a nanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, a Bio-Rad BioLogic LP, ZQ4000 test strip cutter, and X pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), pET32a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), or pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) cells harbouring the HCV gene fragment were grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing 50 g/ml of ampicillin to OD600 = 0.8. primary description Enzyme site F1 5\u2032-CGGGATCCATGAGCACGAATCCTAAACC-3\u2032 Core-190 BamHI R1 5\u2032-TTAAGCTTCTGAAGCGCACAGTC-3\u2032 HindIII F2 5\u2032-CGGGTACCATGAGCACGAATCCTAAAC-3\u2032 Core-68 KpnI R2 5\u2032-TTGGATCCACGTGCCTTGGGGATA-3\u2032 BamHI F3 5\u2032-CGGGT genome contains a single major open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) the 10 proteins encoded within the main ORF are indicated by alternate shading. purification of recombinant HCV antigens differs in column chromatography and reagents. we used a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography column for His-tagged proteins and a glutathione sepharoseTM 4B column for GST-tagged proteins. all purified recombinant HCV antigens were found to be >90% pure based on SDS/polyacrylamide gel analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining. protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. I-LFIA was manufactured using IgG antibody conjugating colloidal gold instead of antigen. each test solution (50 l) was pipetted onto the sample pad and driven to migrate by capillary action along the strip. negative samples provided only one pink control band. a panel of 23 standard positive sera were simultaneously measured by the ELISA, DAS-LFIA, I-LFIA and RT-PCR methods. serial dilutions of a reference panel with known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies with a concentration from 8 NCU/ml to 0.5 NCU/ml were measured by the DAS-LFIA strip. recombinant HCV proteins were produced in BL21 (DE3) cells. expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. expressed proteins were purified with Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography. a new NS3 recombinant protein is a coating antigen of the new DAS-LFIA strip. core and NS3 have strong positive reactions to positive sera. only three serum specimens recognized the NS5B protein. the test line of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip was 2 NCU/ml (Table IV) all antigens ran against negative samples did not show any signs of reactivity. this indicated that the HCV antigen did not cross-react with other common viral antibodies and thus, was highly specific to HCV. the rate of anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip and anti-HCV ELISA immunoassays was 78% (234/300) the rate of anti-HCV DAS-LFIA-negative but ELISA-positive was 2% (6/300). the rate of anti-HCV DAS-LFIA-positive but ELISA-positive was 3.67% (11/300). expression and purification of recombinant HCV proteins in BL21 (DE3) cells. expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. expressed proteins were purified with chelate affinity chromatography. core and a new NS3 recombinant protein have positive reactions to positive sera. core and NS3 (1183\u20131476 aa) each had one false-negative result when testing positive control samples. the test line of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip was 2 NCU/ml. all antigens ran against negative samples did not show any signs of reactivity. this indicated that the HCV antigen did not cross-react with other common viral antibodies and thus, was highly specific to HCV. the rate of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip and the ELISA-negative one was 78% (234/300). the rate of anti-HCV DAS-LFIA-negative but ELISA-positive was 2% (6/300). the rate of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA and ELISA-positive was 16.33% (49/300). the proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells as fusion proteins with a 26 kDa GST-tag or 18 kDa His-tag. the immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti-HCV sera. a peptide spanning aa 2\u2013120 of the C gene (C22) is a major component of the commercially available second-generation anti-HCV tests. it is possible that the C-terminal domain of the core protein contains key peptide sequences for constructing the viral particle and regulating viral assembly (4,20). NS3 contains major antigenic epitopes. the presence of recombinant core and NS3 antigens in the strip may be crucial for the detection of HCV-infected patients with low antibody titers. recombinant antigens encoded by different HCV gene fragments display different immunoreactivity to anti-HCV antibodies."}
