{"summary": "78 male long\u2013evans rats were shipped to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from a commercial vendor. they were singly housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility. all experimental procedures were approved by the IACUC. rats tested negative for all major rodent bacterial and viral pathogens. a second rat (rat 2) was found dead, and a full necropsy was performed. a large calculus (diameter, approximately 8 mm) was lodged in the trigone region of the bladder and adhered to the bladder mucosa. sixteen rats were identified as \u2018suspect,\u2019 meaning the bladder was easily palpable. radiography revealed multiple, round, variably sized mineralized opacities within the region of the urinary bladder in rats 3 and 4. ultrasonography showed hyperechoic foci with shadowing in the same area. the remaining 14 rats had no significant abnormalities of the urinary tract. CBC analyses of all clinically affected rats showed no significant abnormalities except for leukopenia in rat 1. uroliths from rats 1 through 4 were sent to the Minnesota Urolith Center (St Paul, MN); quantitative composition analysis revealed all uroliths to be composed of struvite. tubules range from shrunken and often indistinct (arrow) to dilated. the transitional epithelium of the renal pelvis is ulcerated and invaded by neutrophils. the lumen contains neutrophils and necrotic cell debris. amorphous phosphate and triple phosphate crystals were found in 6 of the 7 affected rats. urine culture revealed P. mirabilis as the predominant organism in 3 of 7 subclinical rats. this organism was cultured from the bladder tissue of a couple of the rats. urease contributes to the virulence of Proteus spp.,14,26. Bacteria increase the pH of urine, leading to the precipitation of normally soluble polyvalent ions, and damage of the protective glycosaminoglycan layer. urolithiasis can be produced experimentally in numerous species including dogs30 and rats. uroliths may be related to the presence of low levels of renal vitamin A. dietary levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus have been shown to influence struvite stone formation in rats. fighting among male mice can lead to local infections and urethral blockage. fighting among male mice can lead to local infections and urethral blockage. urease inhibitors, such as acetohydroxamic acid, inhibit urolith formation in dogs and humans by reducing the pathogenicity of bacteria. acetohydroxamic acid can cause reversible hemolytic anemia and abnormalities in bilirubin metabolism. Proteus spp., classified as an opportunistic agent, are not excluded from the barrier rat colony. the affected rats had metabolic disturbances, coupled with bacterial infection, that predisposed them to develop struvite calculi."}
