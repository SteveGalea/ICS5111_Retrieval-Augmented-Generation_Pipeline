{"summary": "infectious diseases have been emerging and reemerging over millennia. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the most recent 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus are only a few of many examples of emerging infectious pathogens. a vectored vaccine can be rapidly engineered against a newly emerging pathogenic virus by inserting the gene of the protective antigen of the virus into the genome of the viral vector. the magnitude of the immune response to live viral vector vaccines is substantially greater and broader than that induced by vaccines based on subunit proteins or inactivated viruses. avirulent NDV strains are highly safe in avian and non-avian species. NDV replicates well in vivo and induces a robust immune response. a wide range of NDV strains exist that can be used as vaccine vectors. single-stranded RNA of 15,186 to 15,198 nucleotides containing six transcriptional units (3\u2032-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5\u2032) the genome encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F), a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and a large polymerase protein (L virulent NDV strains have multibasic residues that conform to the preferred cleavage site of the intracellular protease furin present in most cell types. avirulent NDV strains typically contain one or two basic residues at the F protein cleavage site and are delivered to the plasma membrane in an uncleaved form for cleavage. this restricts viral replication to the respiratory and enteric tracts where secreted proteases for cleavage are available a single NDV vector can express at least three different foreign genes. hep-2 cells are cotransfected with the antigenome plasmid. avirulent NDV strains LaSota and B1 are commonly used as vaccine vectors because they are virulent in chickens. intravenous administration of 1010 PFU of NDV to humans was safe without causing adverse effects. NDV infects via the intranasal route and is antigenically distinct from common human and animal pathogens. the use of avirulent pathotypes of NDV in humans prevents accidental spread of a virulent virus strain from treated patients to birds. EBOV Hemorrhagic fever GP LaSota Rhesus monkeys in, it Two doses [20] SIV simian AIDS Gag B1 Mouse iv, ip, in 5 107 PFU; one or two doses [27] HIV AIDS Gag B1 Mouse in 5 105 PFU; two doses [14] HIV AIDS Env LaSota Guinea pig in, im 106 PFU; two or three doses in vitro growth kinetics and pathogenicity test in embryonated chicken eggs indicated attenuation of the recombinant NDV. intraperitoneal administration of mice induced higher titers of antibody to influenza virus HA than intraperitoneal administration. immunized mice by the intravenous route were completely protected against a lethal dose of influenza virus. titers of EBOV-specific antibodies and serum EBOV-neutralizing antibodies were undetectable or low compared to those induced by HPIV3/GP. a second immunization resulted in a substantial boost in serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titers in respiratory tract secretions and the serum EBOV-neutralizing antibody titers were equal to those induced after the second dose of the NDV-BC vector was even more effective, with average reductions in viral titer of 13-fold, 276-fold, and 1102-fold in the nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung respectively. this study demonstrated the safety and protective efficacy of NDV as a topical respiratory vaccine vector for SARS-CoV. ized Gag inserted between the P and M genes of NDV induced the highest level of protein expression. expression of gp160 Env and p55 Gag by NDV vector LaSota also induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses in guinea pigs. a single immunization of hamsters with the NDV vectors resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the BmpA and OspC. a single immunization with vector-expressing BmpA resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the BmpA and OspC. rLa-NiVG and rLa-NiVF induced NiV-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and in pigs. this study also showed that rLa-NiVG induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than rLa-NiVF. the vaccine viruses showed the potential to be used for protecting humans and animals against NiV infection. can be a cost-effective method for producing a VLP-based vaccine for humans. study has implications for development of NDV-vectored vaccines for other non-cultivable pathogens of humans. the protective efficacy of laSota-expressing VP2 protein was evaluated by challenging vaccinated chickens with a highly virulent NDV strain Texas GB or a virulent IBDV variant strain. boosting immunization induced higher levels of antibody responses against both NDV and IBDV. gB, gC, and gD were evaluated against ILTV infection in chickens. rNDV-expressing gD induced the highest level of neutralizing antibodies among the tested vaccine candidates. vaccination of chickens with the two viruses conferred protection against virulent ILTV and NDV challenges. viral RNA was detected in 50% of rLS/IBV.S2 + Mass-vaccinated chickens. chickens vaccinated with mass + mass and unvaccinated challenged controls showed 84% and 90% incidence of IBV RNA detection. bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) is a major cause of respiratory tract diseases in cattle. a single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with NDV elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to BHV-1. challenge with BHV-1 showed reduced virus shedding and clinical signs in immunized calves compared to unimmunized claves. canine distemper virus (CDV), a morbillivirus, infects many carnivores. current CDV live vaccine cannot be safely used in some exotic species. inactivated vaccines are not commonly used because of the high cost. the use of live attenuated influenza viruses as vaccines in avian or mammalian species can also raise a major biosafety concern. the use of live attenuated influenza viruses as vaccines can also raise a major biosafety concern. the ectodomain of an H7N7 or H5N1 avian influenza virus HA was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains derived from the F protein of NDV. this approach resulted in enhanced incorporation of the foreign protein into virus particles and the protection of chickens against both HPAIV and a highly virulent NDV. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an attractive vaccine vector for human and animal pathogens. the live attenuated vaccine strains used as vaccine vectors have a proven track record of safety and efficacy."}
