PEDV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9-C59A monomeric structures are superimposable. another dimer of PEDV nsp9 forms a disulfide-linked homodimer. two -strands, 4 and 5, are also involved in dimerization. PEDV nsp9 and the nsp9-C59A mutant were treated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer without DTT, a reagent that can disrupt the intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bond formed by cysteines. the structure is determined by molecular replacement and refined to a 3.0- resolution. nsp9-C59A mutant monomer also shows 7 -strands and an -helix appended at the C terminus. nsp9-C59A mutant monomer yields 94 C atoms with an RMSD of 0.2. the results show that the wild-type PEDV nsp9 protein bound to ssDNA with a Kd of 145 M shows a 2.7-fold reduction in ssDNA binding. the nsp9-C59A mutant shows a 14-fold reduction, and the nsp9-C59A/G99E/G102E mutant shows much weaker binding affinity. the association of nsp9-WT, nsp9-C59A, and nsp9-C59A/G95E/G99E/G102E with 36-mer ssDNA was measured by MST assays. each protein was assayed in 2-fold concentration steps with 10 nM 5\u2032-Cy5-labeled 36-mer ssDNA. each protein was assayed in 2-fold concentration steps with 10 nsp9-K10A, nsp9-R68A/K69A, and nsp9-R106A mutants show slightly weaker ssDNA binding activity. nsp9-K10A and nsp9-R106A mutants have 1.3- and 2.7-fold reductions in ssDNA binding affinity compared to the wild-type protein. the nsp9-K10A/R68A/K each protein was assayed at different concentrations (0, 0.41, 0.82, 1.64, 3.28, 6.56, and 10 M) each protein was used in 2-fold concentration steps with 10 nM 5\u2032-Cy5-labeled 36-mer ssDNA. each protein was used in 2-fold concentration steps with 10 nM 5\u2032-Cy5-labeled ssDNA. PDCoV nsp9-N7 mutant is monomeric in solution, which is consistent with wild-type PDCoV nsp9-N7. the N and C termini of the protein are more conserved than the central core region. in other proteins, mutation of the Gly residues in the motif led to the decreased or the complete loss of dimerization of transmembrane helices. disulfide bonds are rare in the cytoplasm of the infected cell (29) the biological function of the disulfide bond should be further investigated by a reverse genetics system. a previous study suggested that the dimer of PDCoV nsp9 may be critical for viral replication. nsp9-K10A, nsp9-R68A/K69A, and nsp9-R106A mutants mildly affect ssDNA binding activity. nsp9-K10A/R68A/K69A/R106A mutant reveals significant reduction in ssDNA binding activity. nsp9 is able to bind ssDNA or ssRNA (22, 25), although binding of ssRNA is expected to be the native function. nsp9 may not have a specific binding sequence but act in conjunction with other nsp's as a processivity factor (21) in the emerging CoV PDCoV, we first confirm that the N-finger motif is critical for dimerization. the dimerization of PDCoV nsp9 is also supported by the parallel association of the C-terminal -helix via strong hydrophobic interactions. for the SARS-CoV nsp9 protein, the N-terminal extended chain and the C-terminal -helices stabilize its interface. PDCoV nsp9 n7 without the N-finger forms the monomeric stage. the n-finger motif and the GXXXG motif are both important for dimerization. EMSA and MST experiments also suggest that the N-finger of PDCoV nsp9 can influence the affinity to nucleic acids. nsp9 dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein for the IBV infectious clone system. nsp9-Y82A mutant strongly enhances ssDNA binding affinity. nsp9 is able to bind ssDNA or ssRNA (22, 25), although binding of ssRNA is expected to be the native function. the potential site of RNA binding may provide a new insight into the binding of the replication/transcription complexes to viral RNA. most nsp9 proteins originated from ancestral coronavirus, which have N-terminal loops and GXXXG motifs. nsp9s have diverse forms of dimerization that promote their biological function. p9 protein and PEDV nsp9 protein were obtained by adding 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) to Luria broth. the bacteria had grown to an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.6 at 37\u00b0C, followed by shaking at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and 27\u00b0C for 10 h. for protein purification, the cells were harvested, resuspended with phosphate- wild-type protein crystals appeared within 40 days at 20\u00b0C in 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) and 25% (vol/vol) tert-butanol. the nsp9-C59A mutant protein crystals appeared within 2 days at 20\u00b0C in 0.2 M sodium thiocyanate (pH 7.7) and 10% PEG 3350. the buried surface areas between the two monomers and the RMSD were analyzed using PDBePISA (http://pdbe.org/pisa/) and PDBeFold (http://pdbe.org/pisa/) the amino acid sequences of coronavirus nsp9 were aligned using ClustalW2 (37) and visualized with the ESPript 3 server (38). eukaryotic cells were analyzed using a superdex 75 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 200 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (4\u00b0C) wild-type and mutant (N7 and L4A/L6A/R7A/N8A) nsp9 proteins eluted in different fractions were analyzed by membranes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence system. sedimentation boundary was monitored every minute at a wavelength of 280 nm. the gel was run for 50 min with running buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM sodium EDTA [pH 8.3] at 100 mA and 4\u00b0C. after electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 3.5% (wt/vol) -sulfosalicylic acid\u201310% (wt/vol) acetic acid until the dye turned yellow. nsp9 or nsp9 mutant proteins were serially diluted with buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. then 10 nM Cy5-labeled ssDNA diluted with buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)\u2013200 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 was added. thermophoresis was carried out at room temperature, 100% light-e nm of approximately 0.6 at 37\u00b0C followed by shaking at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and 27\u00b0C for 10 h respectively.
