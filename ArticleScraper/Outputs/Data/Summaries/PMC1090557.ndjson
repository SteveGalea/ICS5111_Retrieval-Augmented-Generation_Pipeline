{"summary": "most current DNA diagnostic tests for identifying organisms use specific oligonucleotide probes that are complementary in sequence to, and hence only hybridise with the DNA of one target species. 'dichotomous keys' use combinations of shared characters for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification. using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification. specific oligonucleotide probes are used that are complementary in sequence to, and hence hybridise with, selected regions of the DNA, RNA or cDNA of the target species or genotype. each probe is at least 18 nucleotides long and often twice as long, and is chosen so that it is unique and only hybridises with a single target. the strategy is most efficient when each character bisects the targets into two equal groups, i.e. it is bisectionally distributed, and when different characters bisect the targets differently, ideally in a progressively binary way. in theory the minimum number of characters required to distinguish a finite number of targets by this method is defined by the binary logarithm X = log2Y, where X is the number of characters and Y is the number of targets. a study of three sets of cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (CO-1) genes from representative groups of animal species was carried out by a simple greedy algorithm. the algorithm was based on suffix arrays because they merely maximised the number of pairs of gene-sequences that were distinguished. the algorithm was based on suffix arrays because they use less computer memory than suffix trees. the \"CO1-animal\" data was from 96 species of animals representing the seven dominant phyla of animals. the \"CO1-insect\" data was from 92 species of insects representing eight of the largest orders of insects. the \"test-sequences\" were 604, 603 and 595 nucleotides long respectively in the three sets. distinguishing sub-sequences constituted 15% of the sub-sequences in the pools from each CO1 sequence set. the percentage of DSSs increased in pools of longer sub-sequences, but the number of singletons also increased. peak was found at lengths of 8 or 9 nts in pools from random sequences. peak was found at 9, 10 and 20 nts in those from the CO1-animal, CO1-insect and CO1-moth sequences respectively. only a few short sub-sequences were repeated within one sequence. a minimum complete set (MC) was defined as a set that contained the fewest DSS found by a random trajectory method. the DSSs 18 nts long have predicted Tms in the range 37\u00b0\u201347\u00b0C and no consecutive 'runs' of more than three residues of the same nucleotide. the Accession Codes of their CO1 gene sequences and their 'DSS signatures' are based on the presence/absence of the sub-sequences listed in Table 1 in the selected region of their CO1 gene sequences. CO1-animal and CO1-moth data consisted of only 9, 8 and 11 sub-sequences respectively. MC-sets of the shortest DSSs were close to the theoretically predicted size. however, as DSS length and sequence diversity increased, so did the sizes of the MC-sets. relative efficiency of each DSS was assessed by calculating the percentage of sequence pairs it distinguished. the first DSS selected from the CO1-animal sub-sequences 6 nts long distinguished 41% and 28% of the sequences respectively. the first DSS that were 10 nts and 14 nts long distinguished 41% and 28% of the sequences respectively. speed The search method took 54 seconds to select an MC-set of 16 DSS 20 nts long. the same system took 13 seconds to select an MC-set of 17 DSSs 10 nts long. these tasks took 8 minutes 14 seconds and 85 seconds respectively in a PC. the percentage of DSSs tended towards zero for lengths less than 6 nts. the peak was found at lengths of 8 or 9 nts in pools from random sequences. only a few short sub-sequences were repeated within any one sequence. the number of DSSs in each occupancy category declined at approximately a negatively exponential rate. for all pools, most DSSs were present in fewer than 10% of the sequences. singletons were most common in pools of the longest DSSs. Species representing various superfamilies of moths, together with the Accession Codes of their CO1 gene sequences and their 'DSS signatures', namely the presence/absence of the sub-sequences listed in Table 1 in the selected region of their CO1 gene sequences. noctuoidea AF549715 0111000000000000 Gluphisia lintneri; noctuoidea AF549780 1100001101100001 Ceratomia undulosa; Sphingiodea AF549807 1100010110011000 Smerinthus jamaicensis; Sphingiodea AF549807 0010100100100000 Sphecodina abbottii; 1 the first MC-set was of 11 DSSs, but it was not until eight MC-sets had been successively removed that the MC-set size increased to 12. the average occupancy of the DSSs in the MC-sets steadily declined from a mean of 40.2% (range 48% to 18%) to 29.7% (range 40% to 3%) a set of sequences from 240 isolates of potyvirus gave MC-sets of 22, 38 and 50 DSSs with sub-sequences 7, 10 and 12 nts long respectively. but when the sequences were grouped as the 62 recognized species the MC-sets were less than half the size; only 10, 14 and 19 DSSs respectively. most gene sub-sequences less than 18 nts long are not unique to specific genes. this could be accomplished most conveniently by PCR using region-specific primers or primer mixtures. the chosen region, even from unknown species or subtypes, is likely to be amplified using region-specific primers or primer mixture. the results obtained with the bacterial and viral sequences did not differ in any significant way from those obtained with CO1 sequences. the design of practical diagnostic tests, based on the principles outlined in this paper, would involve several stages. first, known sequences of potential targets would be examined to find regions of convenient length and variability bracketed by conserved sites for PCR primers. high-density microarrays used for SARS were not standard diagnostic tools. high-density microarrays are also not used routinely in infectious disease diagnostics because of their cost and complexity. low-density microarrays typically comprise fewer than 100 probes. sequence diversity and sub-sequence length were found to be the major factors influencing the number of sub-sequences available as probe targets. the CO1-animal data was from 96 species of animals and lacks sequences AF310721, AJ271612, NC_002767 and AF370851 in the reported set. sequence in a dataset was initially converted into a pool of all possible overlapping sub-sequences of a chosen length. the uninformative sub-sequences that were discarded were singletons, replicates and sub-sequences found in all the test-sequences. a \"distinguishing array\" was then constructed that recorded for every pair of test-sequences that it distinguished. DATA Three previously described datasets of CO1 sequences [7,8] were used, although certain sequences were not included either because they could not be retrieved from GenBank, or they were incomplete. sequences were aligned using Clustal X [9] with the default parameters. random sequence datasets were constructed that matched the length and average nucleotide composition of each test-sequence dataset. tests-sequences were degapped, and then every test-sequence in a dataset was initially converted into a pool of all the possible overlapping sub-sequences of a chosen length that it contained. a complete set to distinguish the test-sequences in a dataset was independently confirmed. the greatest distinguishing score at each step of the search was achieved by more than one DSS. this allowed a search to have a random trajectory through a succession of DSS choices. the smallest were sometimes 3 DSSs smaller than the largest."}
