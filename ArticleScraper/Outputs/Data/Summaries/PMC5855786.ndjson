{"summary": "mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, generating a large part of cellular ATP content (adenosine tri-phosphate) these organelles are also involved in vital metabolic processes, such as calcium and iron homeostasis, redox signalling, programmed cell death and finally participate in various physiological processes. advances in live cell imaging revealed the dynamic behaviour of mitochondria (MT) and MT network. fission and fusion are two membrane related opposite processes. mitochondria form an elongated and interconnected network, they resist mitophagy and increase ATP production to adjust to cellular stresses as nutrient deprivation. failure of any of these pathways to maintain homeostasis results in elimination of the entire mitochondria via mitophagy. MT fusion depends on a proper ratio between two major forms of OPA1: the Long (L-OPA1) and Short (S-OPA1) isoforms. MT fusion depends on a proper ratio between the two major forms of OPA1: the Long (L-OPA1) and S-OPA1 is associated with efficient MT fusion. fibroblasts obtained from the patient showed defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission [113] LETM1 The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, monoallelic deletion Fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. neither structural difference of the peroxisome network nor alteration of the respiratory machinery was noticed. cells in which Oma1 expression is down-regulated recovered fused mitochondria more quickly than control cells after CCCP-treatment (CarbonylCyanure m-ChloroPh\u00e9nylhydrazone) cells became less sensitive to staurosporine-induced apoptosis [15], suggesting that in these conditions, OMA1 regulates the functions of the dynamin by modulating the abundance of the L-isoform. this second class of proteins includes Fis1, Mff, MiD49 and MiD51 (FISsion 1 protein, Mitochondrial Fission Factor, and Mitochondrial Dynamics protein 49/51; Figure 1). inhibition of Drp1 function, either by RNA interference or by expressing dominant-negative form of the protein, results in defective MT fission and the occurrence of a hyperfused mitochondrial network. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates ser637 of human DRP1. this modification inhibits mitochondrial fission through inhibition of GTPase activity. kinase anchoring protein 1(AKAP1, also known as Rab32) regulates the phosphorylation of DRP1 on ser637 to preserve mitochondrial network integrity and cell survival. phosphorylation of DRP1 at ser616 by ERK1/2 is an early and necessary step in this process [32]. other phosphorylation sites have also been described, for example, DRP1-Ser693 which is targeted by GSK3 leading to the inhibition of DRP1 GTPase activity and the formation of an elongated mitochondrial network. a defective mitochondrial dynamic machinery could have important physiological consequences including embryonic lethality and diseases. fusion process allows contents exchange, such as mtDNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites between mitochondria, all necessary for maintaining genetic and biochemical homogeneity within the mitochondrial population. mitochondrial Fusion maintain metabolic homeostasis during nutritional stress. the cell implements protective mechanisms in the aim to maintain its homeostasis. the established stress response results either in a positive event which opposes the environmental attack, or in the case of failure, in cell death. mitochondria become tubular and are eliminated via mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy [48] mitochondria become tubular and form extensive and interconnected networks under starvation and are thus protected from autophagic degradation. this result has also been confirmed in human cells models suggesting that efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is associated with mitochondrial connectivity. phosphorylated DRP1 is sequestered in the cytosol, allowing unopposed fusion process. dephosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser637 is achieved by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. calcineurin deficient skeletal muscles exhibit a highly elongated mitochondrial network and increased respiratory chain activity. MT fission aims to reduce the size of mitochondria, so that they are more suitable to be engulfed by autophagosome. mitochondria and mitochondria dynamics have been more recently involved in innate immunity. phore dissipates MT potential and induces MT fragmentation. also, Mfn1/ and Mfn2/derived MEFs display fragmented MT. also, MAVS localizes to other MT subdomains, such as MAMs. a dominant-negative MFN1 mutant suppresses mitochondrial fusion via MFNs inhibition. a dominant-negative MFN1 mutant also reduces antiviral signalling. a dominant-negative MFN1 mutant inhibits mitochondrial fusion. fragmented MT network is not always associated with increased apoptosis but on the contrary can also protect cells from apoptotic death. in infected cells, reduction of mitochondrial fission increased apoptosis. mitochondrial fission correlates with inhibition of HCV secretion. VOPE localizes to mitochondria and interferes with the function of mitochondrial Rho GTPases MIRO1 and MIRO2. the multiprotein complex known as inflammasome activates an inflammatory cascade which activates caspase-1 and induces secretion of interleukin-1 or -18 to provide host innate immune protection. a third study proposed that defect in MT fission results in defect in MT fission. gene mutations in fusion/fission machinery land severe pathologies, especially correlated with muscles, brain and nervous system symptoms. both proteins have been described to participate in a new vesicular pathway consisting in mitochondrial-derived vesicles involved in mitochondrial antigen presentation. this new discovery by mathheoud and co-authors highlights a new link between MT dynamics and autoimmune mechanisms. another neurodegenerative disorder characterized by defect in MT dynamics is Alzheimer\u2019s disease. inhibition of mitochondrial fission disrupted mitochondria segregation and caused loss of stemless traits in the progeny. MT network has been found altered in different kind of cancer, which is not surprising considering that MT dynamics are essential for cell division and cell death. fusion triggers fission and this cycle of fusion/fission segregates less active mitochondria for degradation via mitophagy. MT fusion is a protective and necessary state to promote MT functioning in bioenergetics, while fragmentation rather associates with stressful states. MT can also repair itself by eliminating damaged materials via mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) that bud off and then fuse with lysosomes. MT are sequestered into Rab5-positive early endosomes via the ESCRT-machinery in a parkin-dependent manner. the mechanism by which the VAPB-RMDN3 tethers regulates autophagy seems to be related to their role in facilitating ER-MT Ca2+ exchanges. it stems from several lines of evidence that a tight bidirectional regulation between the autophagic machinery and mitochondria morphodynamics exists. ER-MT contacts sites play role at the interface of relationship between MT shape and autophagy in pathological context. all these discoveries offered new lines of research and disclosed new targets for directed drug discovery."}
