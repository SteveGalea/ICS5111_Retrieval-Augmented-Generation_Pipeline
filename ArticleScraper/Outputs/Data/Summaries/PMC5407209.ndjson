{"summary": "21-year-old was diagnosed with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2011 in El Salvador. he received induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and 1 cycle of intrathecal methotrexate. he received 3 cycles of high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole was discontinued 2 weeks posttransplant secondary to elevated liver enzymes. in march 2014, he developed nonbloody diarrhea and was treated empirically with a 2-week course of prednisone with resolution of the diarrhea. his only medical history was asthma and hypothyroidism. x-ray revealed a solitary right upper lobe nodule measuring 1.4 cm. no other lung nodules, lesions, or pleural effusions were seen. a chest computed tomography scan revealed a 1.6-cm, right upper lung nodule. a repeat chest computed tomography showed a decrease in the size of the right upper lobe nodule. hematoxylin and eosin stains of the biopsy showed areas of necrosis (E) and chronic inflammation (E and F) the patient underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. x virus were negative in the BAL, as were PCRs for EBV, CMV, and adenovirus in blood. the patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the lung nodule. the hematoxylin and eosin stain showed areas of necrosis. DISCUSSION Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus found worldwide with areas of highest endemicity in North America and Central America. the incidence of histoplasmosis after HSCT is unknown but is believed to be rare. all 4 patients with reported outcomes died. a notable common feature of most cases including ours is the recent receipt of corticosteroids for GvHD treatment. a PET scan showed that the pulmonary nodule and an associated hilar lymph node were hypermetabolic indicative of a localized histoplasmoma with a reactive regional lymph node. the use of PET imaging has been previously reported to assist in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis and invasive fungal infections in general. this case may lead to recognition of additional cases of histoplasmosis and reassessment of its incidence in allogeneic HSCT recipients."}
