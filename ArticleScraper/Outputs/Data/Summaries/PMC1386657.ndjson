{"summary": "a previous study showed that high replication of PCV2 in a gnotobiotic pig was correlated with the absence of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies. the aim of the present study was to investigate if this correlation could also be found in pigs in which PMWS was experimentally reproduced. small viruses with a circular single stranded DNA genome are able to maintain a high level of replication up to one month or longer after experimental inoculation. the human hepatitis-related TT-virus, also a member of the circoviridae family, is able to maintain a constant viremia for a period of more than 3 years in infected patients. a high and persisting PCV2-replication level was found to be a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. after experimental PCV2-inoculation, a high variation in virus replication level and duration has been described between pigs. in most pigs, PCV2-titres decreased between 15 and 21 DPI. this study suggested a correlation between absence or delayed production of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies and increased level of replication of the virus in experimentally inoculated pigs. the latter study was performed in gnotobiotic piglets. the aim of the present study was to characterize more in detail the humoral immune response against PCV2 in PMWS-affected and healthy animals. no PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were detected in any pig until the end of the study at 21 DPI. with the Classical SN, no PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were detected in any pig until the end of the study at 21 DPI. the antibody titre in this pig was low (2.7 log4) compared to the other pigs (5.7 \u2013 6.7 log4). with the Classical SN, no PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were detected until the end of the study thus the sensitive SN was applied. all piglets enclosed in both field studies showed maternally derived antibody titres between 3.7 and 6.7 log4. a gradual decline of total anti-PCV2 antibody titres was detected in all pigs except one pig (pig 6) in the Danish study. the majority of the PMWS affected pigs died before they reached the age at which a rise in SN titres could be detected. in none of these pigs, a rise in SN titres was detected. this resulted in a significant lower SN-titre in the PMWS affected pigs. antibody titre of pig with low PCV2-replication (gnotobiotic) or mean titre of PMWS-affected pigs (SPF) p-value was shown when difference between mean titres was significant. in pigs, very little variation was detected in IgM titres. in naturally PCV2-infected pigs, similar observations were made as in the experimentally inoculated animals. in healthy pigs, IgM titres were found to increase steadily towards the end of the study. in healthy pigs, IgM titres were found to increase steadily towards the end of the study. no PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were detected in any pig until the end of the study at 21 DPI. with the Classical SN, no PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were detected in any pig until the end of the study at 21 DPI. only in one PMWS-affected SPF pig (pig 3), a plateau was reached starting from 10 DPI. at 21 DPI, the antibody titre in this pig was low (2.7 log4) compared to the other pigs (5.7 \u2013 6.7 log4). all piglets enclosed in both field studies showed maternally derived antibody titres between 3.7 and 6.7 log4. a gradual decline of total anti-PCV2 antibody titres was detected in all pigs except one pig (pig 6) in the Belgian study. the majority of the PMWS affected pigs died before they reached the age at which a rise in SN titres could be detected. however, one PMWS-affected pig in the Belgian study and 5 pigs in the Danish study survived until the end of the study. pigs with low PCV2 replication (gnotobiotic) or subclinically infected pigs (SPF) pigs with high PCV2-replication (gnotobiotic) or mean titre of PMWS-affected pigs (SPF) pigs with low PCV2-replication (gnotobiotic) or healthy pigs (SPF) IgG2 titres in naturally PCV2-infected pigs differed between healthy and PMWS-affected pigs. the mean IgM titres in PMWS-affected pigs in the Danish study were significantly lower compared to the titres in healthy pigs. neutralizing antibodies against many viruses are more rapidly induced during the immune response and reach higher titres compared to antibodies against other viral epitopes. the slow induction of neutralizing antibodies is a very effective mechanism for the virus to ensure a long period of replication in its host. the susceptibility to these syndromes is highly genetically determined. it has been demonstrated previously that the prevalence of PMWS highly differs between regions. this could be interpreted as an indication that PMWS would be partly genetically determined. the pronounced B-cell lymphopenia that was observed in these pigs may also constitute an important factor in the mechanism causing these changes in the humoral immune response. the parallel evolution of the SN and IgM titres in these pigs suggests that the IgM antibodies might be responsible for the low level of PCV2-neutralization that was observed at 10 DPI. IgM-type antibodies are the first antibodies that are being produced. the plasma cells that produce these antibodies start producing other isotypes of antibodies resulting a down-regulation of IgM production. however, the mechanism of this prolonged presence of IgM antibodies has not been defined yet. sera from four different studies were included in the present study. pigs got experimentally or naturally infected with PCV2 at 19 days of age. in three out of four studies PMWS was observed and diagnosed. pigs were inoculated with PCV2 at the age of 3 weeks. at the time point of inoculation, 5 pigs were injected with keyhole limpet hemocyanin in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. blood was taken every two weeks from 9 piglets originating from 2 litters on PMWS-affected farms in Belgium. in each litter, one piglet developed PMWS during the study and died before the end of the study. eight affected pigs died before the last blood sampling occurred, five pigs developed PMWS but survived until the end of the study. IgG1 or IgG2 were added and incubated for 60 minutes. goat polyclonal antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins were added. peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins were added. the lowest dilution contained 25% serum (1:1 dilution of serum + equal volume of PCV2 stock), thereby the detection limit was 2 log2. a similar neutralization assay had previously been used to detect neutralizing antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. sera In the present study, sera from four different studies were included. pigs got experimentally or naturally infected with PCV2. in three out of four studies PMWS was observed and diagnosed. 10 PCV2-negative SPF-pigs were inoculated with PCV2 at the age of 3 weeks. at the time point of inoculation, 5 pigs were injected with keyhole limpet hemocyanin in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. four out of 10 inoculated pigs developed PMWS and died or were euthanized before the end of the study. in each litter, one piglet developed PMWS during the study and died before the end of the study. eight affected pigs died before the last blood sampling occurred, five pigs developed PMWS but survived until the end of the study.
