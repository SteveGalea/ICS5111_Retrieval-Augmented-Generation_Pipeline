{"summary": "hepatitis C virus is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1], [2], [3]. new estimates of the burden of disease suggest at least 185 million individuals worldwide to have been seropositive in 2005, with a tendency to increase [6] chimpanzees are the only known animal species to adequately reflect human HCV infection [11]. the targeted identification of animal hepaciviruses might help elucidating the obscure origins of HCV and yield more accessible HCV surrogate models. the targeted identification of animal hepaciviruses might help elucidating the obscure origins of HCV. rodents and bats constitute about two thirds of the 5,487 known mammalian species [33] 92 species sampled globally in ten tropical and temperate countries. the investigation was complemented by a comparison of virus diversity in 1,068 horses, cats and dogs. rodent sampling in the Netherlands was licensed by the Dutch animal ethic committee (DEC) under permit numbers 200700119, 200800113 and 200800053. rodent sampling in the Netherlands was granted by the Agricultural Zoology Research Group, Department of Agriculture, Thailand. papua-new Guinea (Ethics-Permit: PNG/NatMus/2002/Export-Permit: Conducted by Papua New Guinea National Museum); papua-new Guinea (Ethics-Permit: 00021/MEFEPA/SG/DGEF/DFC); germany (Ethics-Permit: LANU 314/5327.74.1.6); canine, feline and equine samples were routine diagnostic specimen genome-spanning islets were amplified by PCR using degenerate broadly reactive oligonucleotides. some cDNA templates were enriched using a hexamer-driven amplification. some cDNA templates were enriched using a modified protocol of the Qiagen Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit (Qiagen) a strict clock were sampled every 1,000 steps, resulting in 10,000 trees. a human pegivirus (previously termed GBV-C1; GenBank, U36380) was used as an outgroup. maximum Likelihood analyses were used to confirm Bayesian tree topologies. tertiary horseradish peroxidase-labelled donkey-anti goat Ig was used for signal amplification. rodent sera were diluted 1100 for screening. horseradish peroxidase-labelled goat anti-bat immunoglobulin conjugate was used. hepacivirus immunofluorescence assay VeroFM cells were transfected in suspension using FuGENE HD (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) with 0.75 g plasmid expressing the complete His-tagged NS3 proteins of the rodent hepaciviruses RMU10-3382 (rNS3RMU10-3382) and NLR-AP70 (rNS3AP70) and fixed 24 hours later with acetone/methanol (80%/20%) RMU10-3379 was selected due to best tissue quality and high virus concentration. in-situ hybridization was performed as described by the manufacturer. Accession numbers All viruses reported in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers KC411776-KC411814. rodent sampling in Thailand was granted by the Agricultural Zoology Research Group, Department of Agriculture, Thailand (permit no. KU./14-182) rodent sampling in Gabon was licensed by the Ministry of Water and Forest, statement 003/MEF/SG/DGEF/DFC from 2011. hepacivirus detection and quantification Six nested PCR assays for amplification of hepacivirus RNA and two assays targeting the Flaviviridae sister-genera Flavivirus and Pestivirus were used to ensure broad detection. RNA quantification relied on strain-specific real-time RT-PCR assays and photometrically quantified in vitro RNA transcripts generated as described previously. oligonucleotide primers were then designed to perform long range PCR using the Expand High Fidelity kit (Roche) some cDNA templates were enriched using a hexamer-driven amplification using a modified protocol of the Qiagen Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit (Qiagen) the 5\u2032-genome ends were determined using the Roche rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Roche). maximum Likelihood analyses were used to confirm Bayesian tree topologies using the WAG amino acid substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates in PhyML [38]. mfolding RNA secondary structures in viral 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-genome ends were inferred manually basing on covariant base pairing and thermodynamic predictions. horseradish peroxidase-labelled goat anti-bat immunoglobulin conjugate (Bethyl, Montgomery, AL, USA) or goat-anti mouse Ig (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used as secondary antibodies. tertiary horseradish peroxidase-labelled donkey-anti goat Ig was used for signal amplification. plasmid expressing the complete His-tagged NS3 proteins of the rodent hepaciviruses RMU10-3382 (rNS3RMU10-3382) and NLR-AP70 (rNS3AP70) were tested at screening dilutions of 110 and 140. a goat-anti-mouse Ig (Dianova, 12000) and a donkey-anti-goat cyanine 3-labelled Ig (Dianova, 1200) were goat-anti goat Ig (Bethyl, 11000) and goat-anti mouse Ig (Dianova, 1100) were used as secondary antibodies. a tertiary horseradish peroxidase-labelled donkey-anti goat Ig (Dianova, 1100) was used for signal amplification. myodes glareolus sera were tested at screening dilutions of 110 and 140. a goat-anti-mouse Ig (Dianova, 12000) and a donkey-anti-goat cyanine 3-labelled Ig (Dianova, 1200) were applied. sample contained sera and liver tissue from 4,770 rodents (Rodentia, 41 species), sera from 2,939 bats (Chiroptera, 51 species), sera from 210 horses (Perissodactyla) and sera from 167 dogs (Carnivora) the detailed composition of the sample is listed in Supplementary Table 1. settus glareolus, 30 Apodemus sylvaticus, 30 Rattus norvegicus, 2 Myocastor coypus) and 95 rodents (33 Myodes glareolus, 30 Apodemus sylvaticus, 30 Rattus norvegicus, 2 Myocastor coypus) showed reactivity patterns suggestive of antibodies cross-reacting with HCV. a positive E. helvum serum from Ghana (GH69) diluted 150 in sample buffer with uninfected HuH7 cells infected with HCV strain JHF1 is shown on the left.

Blots were considered borderline if any two antigens showed higher intensity than a cut-off control. a 978 nucleotide NS3 fragment was generated using additional primer pairs. the derived sequences pertained to one clade, and were different from each other by 21.1% on nucleotide. the derived sequences fell into two separate clades. ivirus clades and GBV-B were indicated in only 15 of 5,000 tree replicates (0.3%). the analysis comprised a 978 nucleotide fragment of the HCV NS3 gene corresponding to positions 3,912\u20134,889 in HCV 1a H77 (GenBank, NC_004102). glareolus hepacivirus clade 1 represents KC411807 and KC411784. structural genome region included Core (C), Envelope 1 and 2 (E1 and E2) and p7 genes. characterization The near full genomes of five representative hepaciviruses from all rodent clades were determined. the polyprotein genes were of different sizes including 2,781; 2,887; and 3,007 amino acid residues, respectively. all genomes shared the typical hepacivirus polyprotein organization, encoding putative proteins in the sequence C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A/4B-NS5B. the size of a putative F protein in SAR46 would be 65 amino acid residues. no homology to the HCV F proteins was observed. the most variable genomic regions in rodent hepaciviruses were located in the Envelope E2 gene differing in up to 84.4% of encoded amino acids between the rodent virus clades. the analysis was done in MrBayes and included representatives of all Flaviviridae genera and those five novel rodent viruses whose full polyprotein could be determined. the WAG amino acid substitution model was used. the pestivirus BVDV was chosen as an outgroup and truncated for graphical reasons. the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-genome termini were re-drawn from published foldings for equine hepaciviruses. the 5\u2032-genome terminus of RMU10-3382 contained structural elements typical of both pegi- and HCV-like internal ribosomal entry sites. predicted structural similarities with the HCV-like IRES included the first stem-loop element (termed Ia and highlighted in orange in Figure 5. the 5\u2032-end of AP-70 was identical in structure to RMU10-3382 and contained only a few nucleotide exchanges. a similar 3\u2032-terminal structure could be predicted for GBV-B, but not for the genetically related pegiviruses. no poly-uracil stretch was observed in the rodent hepaciviruses. RNA concentrations were significantly higher in liver tissue. bars represent means and standard deviation of hepacivirus clade 1 RNA in myodes glareolus. in situ hybridization of rodent hepacivirus clade 1 RNA in M. glareolus. Specimen 3187 shows no significantly increased inflammatory activity and no signs of fibrosis in a case with no detectable hepacivirus RNA. a terminal hepatic venule instead of a portal triad is shown. antibodies against the Myodes hepacivirus clade 1 NS3 antigen were found in eight animals (8.3%) at a median end-point titer of 1200 (range, 1100\u2013112800) the difference in antibody detection rates against clades 1 and 2 was not statistically significant. only one of the eight sera positive against M. glareolus clade 1 hepaciviruses also contained antibodies against clade 2 hepaciviruses. additional highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays were designed specifically for the M. glareolus clade 1 and 2 hepaciviruses. the novel hepaciviruses from german horses clustered phylogenetically with the previously described equine viruses. pre-screening by serology Enough serum for serologic testing was available from 180 bats (72 Rousettus aegyptiacus and 108 Eidolon helvum) and 95 rodents (33 Myodes glareolus, 30 Apodemus sylvaticus, 30 NS4 to six (NS5B) sera reacted with individual antigens. 45 sera showed borderline reactivities comparable to the intensity of the WB cut-off control. a tentative evaluation is given following the manufacturer's criteria for human sera. the result of a tentative evaluation is given following the manufacturer's criteria for human sera. only weakly positive bands (visible, but weaker than the core antigen of the weak positive HCV control) were considered negative with the exception of the core antigen. eight bat sera showing strongest Western Blot reactivity were end-point diluted to evaluate specificity of the reaction. hepacivirus RNA was detected in any of the specimens. several PCR fragments from the NS3 gene were obtained. a 978 nucleotide NS3 fragment was generated using primer pairs. trees indicated that the deep phylogenetic nodes were not resolved. monophyly of all three rodent hepacivirus clades and GBV-B was indicated in only 15 of 5,000 tree replicates. black arrows on the top indicate predicted signal peptidase cleavage sites. red arrows below indicate predicted signal peptidase cleavage sites. RMU10-3382 (KC411777) also represents the highly similar virus NLR-365 (KC411796) in M. glareolus hepacivirus clade. NS4a homologue could only be detected in virus SAR-46. of NLR-3382 and SAR-46, only the 5\u2032-end could be partially determined. the 3\u2032-terminus of NLR-AP70 could not be determined. the size of a putative F protein in SAR46 would be 65 amino acid residues and no homology to the HCV F proteins was observed. the most variable genomic regions in rodent hepaciviruses were located in the Envelope E2 gene differing in up to 84.4% of encoded amino acids between the rodent virus clades. analysis was done in MrBayes and included representatives of all Flaviviridae genera. a tombusvirus (Lisianthus necrosis virus, GenBank accession number NC_007983) was chosen as an outgroup. the pestivirus BVDV (NC_001461) was chosen as an outgroup and truncated for graphical reasons. the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-genome termini were re-drawn from published foldings for equine hepaciviruses. hepacivirus domains are highlighted in orange and numbered by roman numbers. the genome ends of representatives of all three rodent viruses were determined. the 5\u2032-genome terminus of RMU10-3382 contained structural elements typical of both pegi- and HCV-like internal ribosomal entry sites. the 3\u2032-ends of RMU10-3382 and SAR-46 contained three highly ordered stem-loop elements. in SAR-46, the 3\u2032-terminal stem-loop structure resembled that of the HCV X-tail. the 3\u2032-end of NLR-AP-70 could not be determined. no staining was observed in RT-PCR-negative M. glareolus liver specimens. RNA-positive and two RNA-negative animals showed low-grade focal lymphocytic invasion. Specimen 3180 shows intermediate portal inflammatory activity with potential low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA concentrations. Specimen 1602 shows low-grade portal inflammatory activity and low-grade fibrosis in a case with high hepacivirus RNA concentrations. a subset of 97 live-trapped M. glareolus with appropriate blood samples were available. antibodies against the Myodes hepacivirus clade 1 NS3 antigen were found in eight animals (8.3%) at a median end-point titer of 1200 (range, 1100\u2013112800) neither hepacivirus clade 1 nor clade 2 antibody-positive sera cross-reacted with HCV by immunofluorescence and by immunoblot. this was compatible with low NS3 amino acid sequence identities. only one of the eight sera positive against M. glareolus clade 1 hepaciviruses also contained antibodies against M. glareolus clade 2 hepaciviruses. hepaciviruses from german horses clustered phylogenetically with previously described equine viruses. hepaciviruses were detected in four-striped grass mice from south africa, as well as in bank voles from central Europe. all discovered viruses originated from deep nodes close to the bifurcations separating genera within the flavivirus tree. novel rodent viruses congeneric with HCV and canine/equine viruses. the minimum distance between the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus would be 73.5%. this corresponds to inter-generic distances within other well-studied families of plus-strand RNA viruses. the hepacivirus clade was preceded by a predominantly hepacivirus-related IRES. the genetic elements potentially homologous to HCV detected in rodent viruses also included microRNA-122 binding sites in the 5\u2032-ncr, an X-tail-like element in the 3\u2032-terminus and a putative F gene in an alternative open reading frame (ORF) of the genus. different species within the related sister genus Pegivirus are separated from each other by about 45% AA distance. we could putatively assume that both Myodes-associated clades distant from each other by 70% AA sequence. the canine/equine hepacivirus clade separated from HCV by 52\u201353% AA sequence would then also form a separate species. the complete absence of viruses in cats and dogs suggests an actual equine association of the canine/equine clade. equids such as wild asses or zebras could be clarified by testing non-domestic equids such as wild asses or zebras. the overall phylogenetic position and monophyly of equine viruses suggest no role as ancestral hepacivirus hosts for horses. a first step to this direction may be an analysis of an expanded bat sample. the novel viruses resemble HCV in important traits of the natural history of infection. the detection of non-identical virus sequences in natural groups of animals should thus be feasible. bank voles can be kept in the laboratory with relatively little effort. e.g., with herpesviruses, bornaviruses, hantaviruses, and flaviviruses. discovery of two highly divergent clades in this species. 6,950 of 7,500 trees replicated (92.7%) yielded a monophyletic origin of the rodent hepacivirus/GBV-B clade. hepaciviruses included were SAR46 (GenBank, KC411807) and SAR3 (KC411806) from Rhabdomys pumilio.
