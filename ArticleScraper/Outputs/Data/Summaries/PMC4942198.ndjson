{"summary": "surfactant lipid, in turn, is 90% lipid and 10% protein by weight (1, 2). Surfactant lipid, in turn, is 80\u201385% PL, a class of lipids with a three-carbon glycerol backbone with a defining polar headgroup at the third carbon, or sn-3 position (either choline, serine, glycerol, inositol, or ethanolamine in series with a phosphate surfactant PL, estimated to be at a remarkable concentration of 35\u201350 mg/ml, is a composite of phosphatidylcholine (PC, 80%), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, 7\u201315%) and small quantities (5% each) of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) (2, 7). surfactant PLs and SPs are synthesized in alveolar epithelial cells. they are secreted apically in response to catecholamines, purinoceptor agonists, and cell stretch. the synthesis and life cycle of surfactant have been well covered in recent comprehensive reviews. signaling by the maturation/differentiation cytokine is best exemplified by the rare disease pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. disrupted granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor signaling is associated with surfactant accumulation and AM immune dysfunction (14). however, the intriguing finding of increased AM \u201cfoam cells\u201d (abnormal lipid-laden AMs) in a wide range of human lung disorders (15) and rodent inhalational exposures inhaled agents and reactive oxygen species oxidize PAPC and PE into oxidized PLs. oxPLs act on multiple receptors on alveolar macrophages, both promoting and suppressing inflammation. plasma lipoproteins, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very LDL (VLDL), deliver and receive lipids to/from alveolar epithelial cells. ATII cells have long been known to bind and take up lipoproteins in vitro. lipoproteins include high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), and to resecrete PLs bearing lipoprotein-derived FAs. ATII uptake and degradation of VLDL enhances PC synthesis. oxLDL-derived oxysterols may further compromise ATII PC levels by inducing ERK-dependent inactivating phosphorylation of CCT (26) and by promoting basolateral efflux of PC via the lipid transporter ATP binding cassette (ABC)A1 (27). dietary perturbations have also been shown to have important effects on surfactant PLs. mice fed a high-fat diet have increased free FAs and triacylglyce changes in surfactant lipid composition have been documented in human lung diseases. decreases in PC and PG and large surfactant aggregates have been associated with impairment in surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant. pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules may drive some of these changes. surfactant PLs attenuate inflammation and modify host response to virus and bacteria. a key requirement for successful gas exchange in the lung is the need to titrate immune responses to inhaled pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules. bacterial LPS is transferred by extracellular LPS-binding protein (LBP) to a cell-associated protein, CD14, which relays LPS to its receptor complex, a heterodimer of TLR4 with the lipid-binding coreceptor, MD2 (44). PI and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PG (POPG), the most prevalent PG species in human surfactant, (10) have been shown to inhibit macrophage proinflammatory responses DPPC supplementation in mice attenuates lung inflammation induced by intravenous LPS (11) DPPC exerts additional antiinflammatory and protective actions, inducing prostaglandin E2 in monocytes (53), down-regulating the monocyte respiratory burst (51, 54), and protecting lung epithelial cells from invasion, lysis, and cytokine production. potent antiviral activities have been shown for both POPG and PI. POPG binds respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and competes with RSV binding to CD14. intranasal treatment of mice with POPG markedly reduces lung viral titers and tissue injury induced by RSV. in vitro exposure of human BALF to ozone directly induces multiple PC and PG oxidation products. in vivo exposure of mice to a wide variety of airway challenges, including cigarette smoke, particulate matter 2.5, acid, H1N1 influenza A virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus also increases oxPAPC species. oxPAPC has been found in the lungs of patients with H5N1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome infections. increased numbers of oxPAPC-laden AMs have also been documented in noninfectious human interstitial lung diseases. oxPAPC-laden AMs have also been documented in noninfectious human interstitial lung diseases. multiple chemical and infectious exposures induce oxPAPC in the lung. it activates a pathway through TLR4 and its adaptor, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-, to cytokine-dependent acute lung injury (76). oxPAPC, formed in the lung during influenza A virus infection, induces TLR4-dependent, CD14-independent proinflammatory lung injury that can be suppressed by the TLR4 antagonist, eritoran oxPAPC may serve as a feedback brake on bacteria-induced inflammation and injury. sites of localized or intense oxPAPC accumulation might drive dysregulated disease responses. oxPL species are antiinflammatory and/or immunosuppressive through mechanisms other than TLR ligand antagonism. e action on PE that is elevated in the BALF of patients with cystic fibrosis, and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid\u2013PE were recently identified as antiinflammatory oxPLs. POVPC also promotes M2 polarization and TGF expression by AMs, inducing pulmonary fibrosis in mice (16). a profusion of papers have reported intriguing, pleiotropic biologic activities of 25HC on multiple immune receptors. 25HC increases poly(I:C)-induced cytokines in airway epithelial cells via effects on nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and amplifies TLR-induced gene induction in macrophages. Ch25h\u2013null mice have exacerbated mortality after systemic LPS challenge (114) 25HC also reduces IgA levels in the lung and other mucosal sites. 7,25-dihydroxycholesterol, a product of secondary oxidation of 25HC by the enzyme Cyp7b, plays a critical role in systemic humoral immunity. oxPLs and oxysterols are ancient and ubiquitous modified-self autoantigens. innate B cells produce natural antibodies that recognize oxPAPC species on the surface of apoptotic cells and regulate cell corpse clearance by macrophages. it has been proposed that these anti-oxPL clones have been preserved through natural selection for their importance in both host defense and tissue homeostasis. anti-oxPAPC antibodies have been shown to block oxPAPC-induced proinflammatory responses by lung macrophages. the unique environmental susceptibility of the lung may have made this organ an evolutionary hub and an engine for lipid-immune cross-talk. the alveolar microenvironment should be recognized as susceptible to dyslipidemia and other systemic disorders. may lead to development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in lung disease. authors thank Dr. Sue Edelstein for figure production."}
