{"summary": "arenaviruses have single-stranded, bisegmented ambisense RNA genomes and form enveloped virions. MACV causes human disease outbreak with high case-fatality rates. at least 1,200 cases with 200 fatalities have been recorded. transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is the principle cell-surface receptor of MACV, JUNV, GTOV, and SABV [17], [18], and a major determinant of host adaptation. studies on receptor use and cellular tropism suggest that the non-pathogenic Clade B viruses Amapari (AMPV) and Tacaribe (TCRV) can enter human cells in a human TfR1-independent manner [18], [19], [20] ated MACV GP1 (region 87\u2013239) [24] provided structural insight of GP1 residues that contact TfR1. the latter study identified five interaction motifs in the interface between MACV GP1 and the apical domain of TfR1. we created a panel of MACV GP1 variants replacing the mentioned amino acids with alanine. MACV GP1 fragment 87\u2013239 [6], orientated with the N- and C-termini to the bottom panel, structure of MACV GP1 fragment 87\u2013239 [6], orientated with the N- and C-termini to the bottom. results We aligned the GP1 sequences of MACV (residues 59\u2013258) with those of JUNV, GTOV, and SABV. human CD5 upstream and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 downstream of the ORF. proteins were purified as described [17], [26]: individual plasmids were transfected into HEK 293T/17 cells. plasmids were eluted with 3 M MgCl2, dialyzed in PBS. t using the WesternBreeze Chromogenic kit (Invitrogen) and a murine monoclonal anti-TfR1 antibody (Invitrogen) shown is a representative western blot from two independent experiments. A, expression of wild-type MACV GP1 and variants thereof to co-immunoprecipitate hTfR1. cells with bound proteins were incubated with a 140 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) cell-surface binding of constructs was detected by flow cytometry. y122, S116A and D114A/S116A (motif 2) exhibited high cell-surface binding. the spectra all revealed a single broad minimum in the range of 108 to 216 nm. the results are consistent with similar folding of the wt and mutant proteins. a representative western blot analysis of the various MoMLV pseudotypes is shown using an antibody against MACV GP2. in agreement with the co-IP and cell-binding data, MoMLV carrying GPC mutants D114A, S116A, D140A, and K169A had no effect on entry into human (HeLa) and nonhuman primate (Vero) cells. mutants D123A, D155A, P160A, F226A, K167 MACV GPC mutant W147A behaved unexpectedly in that it had no effect on MoMLV transduction efficiency. the two mutants with the most significant effect on cell entry were the R111A mutant and the triple mutant Y122A/D123A/K169A. the Y122A mutant, while minimally affecting entry into Vero cells, decreased MoMLV entry into HeLa cells. interaction motif 1 makes prominent contacts with hTfR1 II-2 strand. F226, unique to MACV (W in other New World arenaviruses), is part of interaction motif 3 and has a hydrophobic interaction with hTfR1 V210. Y122 forms one with hTfR1 E343 and in addition contacts hTfR1 residues A293, E294, and A340. MACV GP1 is colored in dark grey. mutated residues are labeled and colored in magenta. MACV GPC residues D114, S116, D140, K169 and most likely W147 are dispensable for cell attachment and entry of MACV. MACV GP1-hTfR1 crystal structure revealed seven N-linked glycans on Asn178 [25]. the MACV GP1-hTfR1 crystal structure revealed seven N-linked glycans on asn178 [25]. glycans play an important role in MACV glycoprotein folding. retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the MACV glycoproteins of arenaviruses adopt the receptor-binding characteristics of the corresponding viruses [17], [20], [27]. therefore, it is important that the system is simplistic and uses only a few viral proteins in the absence of other viral-encoded proteins or genomic elements."}
