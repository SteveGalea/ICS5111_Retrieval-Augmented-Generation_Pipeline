{"summary": "human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are newly recognized single-stranded RNA viruses that were previously classified in the Enterovirus genus1. among 16 HPeV serotypes, HPeV-3 infection occurs most frequently among infants below the age of 3 months2. blood pressure 80/50 mmHg, heart rate 168 beats/min, respiratory rate 38 breaths/min, and body temperature 38.8\u00b0C. no bacteria were found in blood, CSF, or urine samples. erythematous rash and swelling were observed on the patient's hands and feet. intravenous immunoglobulin was administrated because severe systemic inflammatory responses were considered in the patient. case 2 A 25-day-old female neonate was admitted to Gyeongsang National University Hospital due to high fever and poor feeding. no viruses causing gastroenteritis, including rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, and enterovirus were detected. erythematous rash and edema were observed on the patient's hands and feet at day 4 of admission. blood pressure 80/50 mmHg, heart rate 168 beats/min, respiratory rate 38 breaths/min, and body temperature 38.8\u00b0C. no bacteria were found in blood, CSF, or urine samples. no respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. at day 5 of admission, erythematous rash and swelling were observed on the patient's hands and feet. erythematous rash and edema were observed on the patient's hands and feet at day 4 of admission. the patient was discharged on day 7 of admission without IVIG administration. a prospective study showed that it was not possible to distinguish neonatal HPeV infection (most are HPeV-3) from enterovirus infection on the basis of clinical signs. distinctive clinical features, including palmar-plantar erythema and hyperferritinemia, have been suggested as diagnostic indicators of an HPeV-3 infection. the median age of onset in the patients was 31 days4) in 5 of 9 patients (55%), palmar-plantar reddening appeared on day 3 after fever onset, on average. fever persisted for a median of 3 days (range, 1\u20134 days) and the distinctive skin rash developed at a mean of 3 days (range, 1\u20135 days) after fever onset. the pathogenesis of the distinctive rash in HPeV-3 infection is still unknown. there are no studies about immediate antibody responses after HPeV-3 infection. hyperferritinemia seems to be another diagnostic clue for HPeV-3 infection. management of HPeV-3 infection is limited to supportive care. there are no effective antiviral drugs against HPeV13. should be studied."}
