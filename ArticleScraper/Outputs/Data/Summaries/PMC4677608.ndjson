{"summary": "canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) causes both sporadic disease and outbreaks (1,2) the disease is of particular concern in crowded populations and where there is extensive dog-to-dog contact, particularly in re-homing kennels. sporadic disease is important for prevention and management of disease. a better understanding of CIRDC is important for prevention and management of disease, including decision-making for vaccination (1\u20133,7,9). up to 3 swabs were collected from the areas of most predominant clinical signs. one to two dry sterile cotton-tipped wooden swabs were first used. samples for bacteriological culture were collected with a sterile swab. fast panel PCR Canine Respiratory Disease Profile for the detection of B. bronchiseptica, CAV-2, canine distemper virus (CDV), CHV-1, canine influenza virus H3N8, influenza H1N1 virus, influenza H5N1virus, CPIV, CRCoV, Mycoplasma cynos, and Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus. two types of final multivariable models were presented. the first model contained only variables in which estimates for each covariate could be produced. the second model adjusted for additional demographic variables that could not be used as covariates in the final model because of computational requirements. samples were collected with a sterile swab that was then placed into a sterile tube containing Amies transport medium. most clinically relevant regions were cultured: nasal discharge, conjunctiva, or deep pharyngeal region. most cases were presented in the first week of their illness. Statistical analysis Data for case and control dogs were described using frequencies and proportions. demographic data such as age, dog breed, and time since last vaccination were aggregated into binary variables on the basis of biologically plausible cut-off points. cynos CPIV Bordetella bronchiseptica CRCoV, CHV-1, and CDV (Table 1). Complete results based on detection of individual pathogens, as well as unique combinations of pathogens further stratified by the CIRDC status are presented in Table 1. no control dogs had CPIV, while 27/64 (42%) case dogs had the virus. in dogs with CIRDC, 32/64 (50.0%) had 2 or more pathogens present, while in dogs without CIRDC only 3/22 (13.6%) had 2 or more pathogens. Table 3 contains variables that were univariably associated with the CIRDC status of dogs. all exposure variables (i.e., pathogens) regardless of statistical significance and demographic and management variables associated at the P 0.20 level are shown. ility Other Baseline \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Female 0.80 0.26 2.57 0.85 a P-values estimated using exact logistic regression. b Estimates represent \u201cmedian unbiased regression estimates\u201d. 95% CI \u2014 95% confidence interval. no CIRDC-case dog had simultaneous detection of CPIV and CRCoV (Table 1). CPIV was associated with presence of CIRDC in this population of dogs, after adjustment for the effect of age, fertility, and dog size. CPIV is a well-known canine respiratory pathogen that belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family of RNA viruses (3). CRCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. it is distinct from the enteric canine coronavirus (CCoV) it is not clear whether CRCoV alone can lead to clinical signs of CIRDC. cynos was the only canine Mycoplasma that showed significantly higher presence in CIRDC cases than controls, but only for samples taken from the lower respiratory tract by tracheal and bronchial lavage. the detection rate of B. bronchiseptica in this study was similar in CIRDC positive and negative dogs. selection of controls was based on convenience sampling and could lead to selection bias. if bias occurred because of that, we would argue that it could lead to an overestimate of associations due to viral pathogens, and underestimation of associations with bacterial pathogens. the CRCoV was detected in cases only, but difference in presence of this pathogen was not significant at P 0.05. the frequency of M. cynos was similar in affected and control patients."}
