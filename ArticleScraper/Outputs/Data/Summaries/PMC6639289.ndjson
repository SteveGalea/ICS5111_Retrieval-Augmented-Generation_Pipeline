{"summary": "CHIKV is an important reemerging mosquito-transmitted pathogen. its genome is a single-stranded positive RNA of 12 kb with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. four nonstructural proteins encoded in the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the CHIKV genome are responsible for viral replication and transcription. different types of CHIKV vaccines have been developed, including subunit vaccines (12), viruslike particles (VLPs) (13), formalin-inactivated vaccines (14), DNA vaccines (15), pseudoinfectious virus (16), a single-dose insect alphavirus-vectored vaccine (17), and different live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) a virus Ankara (MVA) (25\u201327), adenovirus (28), and the measles virus vaccine Schwarz strain (29) have been explored as potential viral vectors for chimeric CHIKV construction. a CHIKV mutant harboring a complete deletion of capsid gene was constructed. in vitro-transcribed WT and mutant genomic RNAs were transfected into BHK-21 cells. the spread of IFA-positive cells indicated the production of infectious viruses from transfected cells. only scattered IFA-positive cells were found in RNA-transfected cells at each time point. RNAs were extracted from culture media and infected cells for reverse transcriptase PCR spanning the region from the C terminus of nsP4 to the N terminus of E3. the expected 1.7- and 1.0-kb RT-PCR products were detected in the RNA genome. -CHIKV, and Triton X-100 treatment completely destroyed the infectivity of both viruses. ruled out possibility that RNA carryover from transfected cells generates virus transmission to new cultures. morphologies of C-CHIKV viral particles during viral infection were first examined by thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in BHK-21 cells. abundant viral particles were observed at the cell surface of C-CHIKV- and WT CHIKV-infected cells. the culture media were collected from infected BHK-21 cells at different time points postinfection. a plaque assay showed that sera against CHIKV blocked viral infection by C-CHIKV and WT CHIKV in a dose-dependent manner. corresponding eGFP reporter viruses, WT CHIKV-eGFP and C-CHIKV-eGFP, were used as described in Materials and Methods. shown are mean half-life values obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. 10 fractions were harvested from the top (fraction 1) to the bottom (fraction 10) of the gradient. each fraction from WT CHIKV (B and D) and C-CHIKV (A and C) was subjected to qRT-PCR and E1-specific antibody-based Western blot assays to monitor the distribution of virions. western blot assays to analyze viral nsPs with antiserum targeting CHIKV nsP1 to nsP4. gels were loaded with purified C-CHIKV or WT CHIKV. only trace amounts of nsP1 and nsP2 were observed for both viruses. three independent passages (passages A, B, and C) were performed on BHK-21 cells. the growth curve (Fig. 7C), plaque morphology (Fig. 7B) and E2/capsid protein expression (Fig. 7D) of C-CHIKV were not changed on BHK-21 cells. the IFNAR/ mouse is a commonly used murine model for CHIKV pathogenesis studies (21) it has the advantage of demonstrating disease in adult mice and provides a lethal endpoint upon CHIKV challenge (17). so, 6-week-old IFNAR/ mice were injected subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the hind foot with 102 PFU of WT CHIKV. a single dose of C-CHIKV can elicit protection against CHIKV infection in both IFNAR/ and C57BL/6 mice. the negative control was culture medium alone (2% FBS\u2013DMEM immunization) or no treatment (mock immunization) successfully induced at 14 days postimmunization and remained steady without a dramatic decline at 28 days postvaccination. 50% neutralization of CHIKV at a serum dilution of 1:160 was lower than other live-attenuated vaccines induced with an 80% plaque reduction/neutralization titer (PRNT80) of 1:160 in previous studies when mice were immunized with the same dose. mice immunized with 2% FBS\u2013DMEM and C-CHIKV were subcutaneously challenged on the hind foot with 103 PFU of WT CHIKV at 30 days postimmunization. 2% FBS\u2013DMEM-vaccinated mice experienced substantial footpad swelling and weight loss beginning at day 3 and day 6 postchallenge. mmunized mice were slightly lower than those in sera from mice immunized with WT CHIKV. at 30 days postimmunization, all mice were challenged with 2.5 105 PFU of WT CHIKV (ECSA strain, a human isolate from Pakistan) no footpad swelling was observed in both WT CHIKV- and C-CHIKV-immunized mice. the culture medium (2% FBS\u2013DMEM) was used as a negative control for mock immunization. mice were challenged s.c. in feet with 2.5 105 PFU of WT CHIKV (ECSA strain) the spread of IFA-positive cells indicated the production of infectious viruses from transfected cells. only scattered IFA-positive cells were found in C-CHIKV-115aa RNA-transfected cells at each time point. HK-21 cells were infected with the supernatants harvested from WT or mutant genomic RNA-transfected BHK-21 cells. at 72 hpi, the expression of viral E2 protein was analyzed by an IFA. the absence of capsid in C-CHIKV-infected cells was confirmed with different methods. infected cells were subjected to IFAs and Western blot assays. at 72 hpi, cells were subjected to an RT-PCR assay. RT-PCR was performed with the primer pair spanning the nsP4-E3 region. the data are the means standard deviations (SD) from at least three independent experiments. abundant viral particles were observed at the cell surface of C-CHIKV- and WT CHIKV-infected cells. culture media were collected from infected BHK-21 cells at different time points postinfection. C-CHIKV produced smaller plaques than the WT virus. the highest viral titer of 104 PFU/ml at 120 h postinfection. the bars indicate the standard deviation from three independent experiments. we also compared viral particle densities by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis. imageJ software was used to analyze the intensity of the viral E1 protein band in each fraction. graphs represent quantification of percent viral RNA/E1 protein in each fraction normalized to the largest amount of viral RNA/E1 protein. three independent experiments were performed, with similar results. Western blot assays to analyze viral nsPs with antiserum targeting CHIKV nsP1 to nsP4 and exosomes with marker CD63 antibody. gels were loaded with purified C-CHIKV or WT CHIKV virions. only trace amounts of nsP1 and nsP2 were observed for both viruses. RT-PCR was performed with a pair of primers spanning the nsP4 and E3 regions. the results showed that the engineered capsid deletion still remained in all three passaged viruses. 6-week-old IFNAR/ mice were injected subcutaneously with 102 PFU of WT CHIKV, 105 PFU of C-CHIKV, and 2% FBS\u2013DMEM. all the WT-infected mice died within 8 days postinfection. a single dose of C-CHIKV can elicit protection against CHIKV infection in both IFNAR/ and C57BL/6 mice. the dramatic attenuation of C-CHIKV in both IFNAR/ and C57BL/6 mice indicates that C-CHIKV may be a potential CHIKV vaccine candidate. single-dose immunization with C-CHIKV protects IFNAR/ mice from CHIKV infection. mice were immunized with 104 PFU of C-CHIKV or 2% FBS\u2013DMEM. mice were subcutaneously challenged on the ventral/lateral side of the hind foot. mice vaccinated with C-CHIKV were fully protected against challenge with WT CHIKV. 2% FBS\u2013DMEM-vaccinated mice experienced substantial footpad swelling and weight loss beginning at day 3 and day 6 postchallenge. 2% FBS\u2013DMEM-immunized mice died within 8 days postchallenge. at 30 days postimmunization, all mice were challenged with 2.5 105 PFU of WT CHIKV (ECSA strain, a human isolate from Pakistan) no footpad swelling was observed in both WT CHIKV- and C-CHIKV-immunized mice. two peaks of footpad swelling were observed in mock-immunized mice. mice were challenged s.c. in feet with 2.5 105 PFU of WT CHIKV. viremia from day 1 to day 5 postchallenge was measured by qRT-PCR. all the data represent means SD for groups of mice. X-100 and RNase A treatment assays indicated that C-CHIKV could pack viral genomes into infectious particles with the expression of envelope glycoproteins alone. other alphaviruses, such as SFV and Sindbis virus (SINV), lacking a complete capsid also produced infectious particles called infectious microvesicles (37). the capsid protein specifically interacts with the replicated genomic RNA (49S RNA) to form NCs in the cytoplasm (45) the NCs are then transported to the plasma membrane, where they interact with envelope proteins to drive the budding of virus particles from the plasma membrane (44, 47, 48) to assess the stability of C-CHIKV, we passaged it in BHK-21 cells for five rounds. this showed that C-CHIKV remained stable at least within five passages. the risk of reversion to virulence of WT CHIKV from C-CHIKV was low. cDNA clone of CHIKV (pACYC-CHIKV) and its enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-dual-sg-CHIKV) reporter vector (eGFP-dual-sg-CHIKV) were used as the backbone for engineering capsid deletion mutants. the region from nsP4 to E2 lacking the RNA binding domain of capsid (amino acids [aa] 2 to 116) was amplified using overlap PCR. the pACYC-C-CHIKV plasmid with a whole deletion of the capsid gene (aa 2 to 261) was constructed as follows. a series of 1:10 dilutions was made by mixing 15 l of the virus sample with 135 l of DMEM. each dilution was added to individual wells of 24-well plates containing confluent BHK-21 cells. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 h before a layer of 2% methylcellulose was added. RNA levels were quantified with a real-time RT-PCR assay. total cellular RNAs were extracted using a TRIzol reagent. the virus fraction was recovered from the gradient. ten 500-l fractions were collected from the top to the bottom. a plaque reduction or neutralization test (PRNT) was performed. approximately 100 PFU of WT CHIKV was preincubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated mouse sera (starting at a 1:10 dilution) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. at 24 hpi (WT CHIKV) or 84 hpi (C-CHIKV), infected cells were prefixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 2 h before being scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min. pellets were dehydrated stepwise in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. IFNAR/ mice were challenged with 103 PFU of WT CHIKV s.c. and C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 2.5 105 PFU of WT CHIKV s.c. in the ventral/lateral side of the hind foot. animal survival, footpad swelling, and weight loss were monitored over 2 weeks. CHIKV stock was produced from the infectious cDNA clone (52) and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. rabbit polyclonal antisera specifically targeting CHIKV nsP1 to nsP4 was provided by Andres Merits. eGFP reporter virus vector lacking the full sequence of capsid (aa 2 to 261) was constructed as follows: a fragment containing a repeated subgenomic promoter and eGFP gene amplified from the eGFP-dual-sg-CHIKV plasmid was amplified via overlap PCR and introduced into the plasmid pACYC-C-CHIKV between E2 and the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) cells were seeded into six-well plates containing coverslips and transfected with CHIKV genomic RNA or infected with CHIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with FITC. natants harvested from infected BHK-21 cells or each viral fraction by sucrose gradient centrifugation were extracted with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit. at 30 hpi (WT CHIKV) or 96 hpi (C-CHIKV), the supernatants were collected through sequential centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min and 5,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. on X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on ice for 10 min. purified virus particles or cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. activated mouse sera (starting at a 1:10 dilution) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. mixture was then added to BHK-21 cell monolayers in 12-well plates. plaque count was reduced by 50% compared with the control. cells were postfixed with 1% OSO4 for at least 2 h at 4\u00b0C. all pellets were dehydrated stepwise in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. all data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.) all data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.)"}
