{"summary": "Coronaviruses form a group of enveloped viruses that have the largest genome among RNA viruses. the genus Betacoronavirus is divided into four different lineages: A, B, C, and D. the HE protein, present in species of the betacoronavirus genus, is also a type 1 transmembrane protein (9), and it interacts with different types of sialic acid, associated with an apparent role in hemagglutination. hemagglutination may be important early during infection, possibly in virus binding to or later during release of viral particles from infected cells. pha (MEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA) and used to propagate all of the different viruses. the BHK-21 cell line (ATCC-CCL10) was also cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 M nonessential amino acids. a point mutation in the HE gene either at nucleotide position 8 of the coding sequence to replace the amino acid residue leucine at position 3 by a STOP codon (pBAC-OC43-HEstop) or at nucleotide position 347 of the HE coding sequence to mutate the amino acid residue at position 116 from a serine to a phenylalanine (S116F), designated pBAC-OC43-HES116F cortical cell cultures were harvested in Hanks balanced salt solution. they were incubated in 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA supplemented with 20 g of DNase I/ml. the trypsin solution was then slowly discarded with a sterile pipette. the samples were then briefly centrifuged at 250 g. MEM- supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) FBS, respectively, for different periods of time. infection was made at an approximate MOI of 0.0001 without PBS washing and incubated at 33\u00b0C for 48 h (HRT-18) or 37\u00b0C for 24 and 48 h for primary cultures before being analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). hed with PBS and incubated at 33\u00b0C with fresh MEM- supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) FBS (HRT-18) or 37\u00b0C with fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 2.5% (vol/vol) FBS (LA-N-5) for 24 h before being analyzed by IFA. Statistical significance was estimated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc Dunnett's (two-sided) analysis. 5 g of either pBAC-OC43FL, pBAC-OC43-HEstop, pBAC-OC43-HES40T, or pBAC-OC43-HES40T were evaluated. the medium was changed 8 h after transfection and replaced by MEM- supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS. the cells were incubated 3 days at 37\u00b0C. the secondary antibody was an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (Life Technologies/Molecular Probes) the primary antibodies were a rabbit antiserum (1/1,000) against the structural proteins of BCoV (kindly provided by Serge Dea) the cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488- and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies. the cells were then incubated for 5 min with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 g/ml. RNA was extracted from transfected BHK-21 cells using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit. portions (5 g) or total RNA were reversed transcribed for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR using the superscript III first-strand kit with oligo(dT) primer (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. quantitative real-time PCR was normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) expression. guinea pig antiserum was made in-house by immunization of a guinea pig with inactivated HCoV-OC43. cell lines, pBAC-OC43 cDNA clones, and corresponding recombinant viruses were cultured in minimal essential medium alpha the next day, and every 2 days for 6 days, medium was replaced with the same medium containing 10 M all-trans retinoic-acid (Sigma-Aldrich) the wild-type reference HCoV-OC43 virus, designated here HCoV-OC43 rOC/ATCC, was obtained from the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-OC43FL (19) position 40 was mutated to a threonine to modify the active site to FGDT. overlapping PCR was used to obtain a cDNA clone with complete deletion of the HE gene. Embryos at 12 to 14 days of gestation were removed from pregnant anesthetized CD1 mice. in 1 ml of neurobasal medium, supplemented with 0.5 mM l-glutamine and B27 supplement (Life Technologies) per brain. cells were seeded at 106/cm2 and grown on poly-d-lysine-treated glass coverslips. cultures were ready for infection after 7 days in culture. the HE protein of BCoV was used to evaluate the importance of the HCoV-OC43 HE protein during infection. wild-type recombinant HCoV-OC43 was preincubated with different antibodies for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence to detect the S protein. the neutralization of infection by the KD-9-40 MAb was to a level of almost 90% compared to infection in the presence of medium alone or in the presence of non-neutralizing antibody 3.2B2. the supernatant (P0) served to inoculate HRT-18 cells in order to amplify viral stocks. the medium from this first round of amplification (P1) was recovered and served for a second round of viral amplification. the production of infectious viral particles corresponding to the different pBAC-OC43 cDNA clones was titrated by an immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) the secondary antibody was an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody. for primary cultures of the mouse CNS, the primary antibodies were a rabbit antiserum (1/1,000) against the structural proteins of BCoV. the cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488- and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/1,500; Life Technologies/Molecular Probes) the statistical significance was estimated by ANOVA, followed by post hoc Dunnett's (two-sided) analysis. RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR were performed using a ND1000 spectrophotometer. real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the SsoFastEvagreen supermix qPCR kit (Bio-Rad) with the Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science) with 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. the primers C-forward (5\u2032-TAT TCA GGT TGT GAC GA-3\u2032) and D-reverse (5\u2032-CC the cDNA molecular clone pBAC-OC43FL was used to design strategies of deletion/inactivation of the gene encoding the HCoV-OC43 HE protein. the deletion of 1.2 kbp (the complete HE gene) was detected by the digestion of the reference and mutagenized cDNA infectious clones by the SfoI and SacII restriction enzymes. transfection of BHK-21 cells by pBAC-OC43FL led to the detection of wild-type HCoV-OC43 recombinant infectious virus (rOC/ATCC) the level of production of infectious virus was reproducibly under the limit of detection, with one exception of the molecular clone of pBAC-OC43-HEstop-A1. the HE protein was produced only in BHK-21 cells transfected with pBAC-OC43FL or pBAC-HES40T. an acetyl-esterase assay revealed that only pBAC-OC43FL produced an active form of HE protein, compared to all pBAC-OC43 HE mutants and to mock-transfected BHK-21 cells (Lipofectamine LTX) pBAC-OC43-HES116F molecular clone confirmed it was possible to mutate the HE protein in other domains and produce easily detectable and significant amounts of infectious HCoV-OC43 particles. pBAC-OC43-HES116F molecular clone confirmed that it was possible to mutate the HE protein in other domains. BHK-21 cells ectopically expressing the HCoV-OC43 wild-type HE protein complement recombinant pBAC HE mutants. samples were run on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel. amplicons were revealed with ethidium bromide. HCoV-OC43 HE protein with acetyl-esterase activity is more efficient than stable pBAC HE mutants. pcDNA-HE or the pcDNA-HEv5 are vectors expressing the wild-type HE protein, either alone or fused with a v5 epitope. this experimental approach led to a significant increase in infectious virus production compared to cotransfection of cells with the pcDNA vector without HE. wild-type HE protein after transfection of BHK-21 cells with either pcDNA-HE or pcDNA-HEv5 compared to pcDNA alone. he-complemented recombinant HCoV-OC43 can make a first round of infection of human epithelial cells and primary cultures from murine CNS but are defective in producing infectious progeny virions. at 48 h postinfection, wild-type virus had spread within the culture. pcDNA-HE vector and pBAC-OC43-HEstop or pBAC-OC43-HES40T were able to infect HRT-18 cells. 1% of neurons produced viral antigens 24 h postinfection by either HE mutant virus. the percentage of infected neurons was the same for the HE-complemented virus produced by the cotransfection of pcDNA-HE plus the pBAC-OC43-HEstop molecular clone. at the same time postinfection, the percentage of neurons infected by the HE-complemented virus produced by the cotransfection of pcDNA-HE and the pBAC-OC43-HES40T molecular clone had increased significantly. the HE protein may enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of susceptible human cells. HE-complemented mutant viruses were able to infect epithelial cells (HRT-18) and primary cultures from murine CNS. cDNA molecular clone pBAC-OC43FL was used to obtain cDNA molecular clones with either a deleted or mutated HE gene. these different mutants either lack the HE gene (pBAC-OC43-delHE) or possess a mutated HE gene (pBAC-OC43-HEstop and pBAC-OC43-HES40T) matically inactive HE protein (HE0) produce viral S protein but no HE protein bearing acetyl-esterase activity and no detectable infectious recombinant HCoV-OC43. transfection of BHK-21 cells by the pBAC-OC43FL led to the detection of wild-type HCoV-OC43 recombinant infectious virus (rOC/ATCC) IFA confirmed that the viral S protein was produced in transfected BHK-21 cells at equivalent levels for all of the pBAC-OC43FL or pBAC-HES40T clones. the HE protein was produced only in BHK-21 cells transfected with pBAC-OC43FL or pBAC-HES40T. an acetyl-esterase assay revealed that only pBAC-OC43FL produced an active form of HE protein. pBAC-OC43-HES116F molecular clone confirmed that it was possible to mutate the HE protein in other domains and produce easily detectable and significant amounts of infectious HCoV-OC43 particles. pBAC-OC43-HES116F molecular clone confirmed that it was possible to mutate the HE protein in other domains. the two clones express the HE protein at a low, but significant level compared to BHK-21 cells transfected by the control vector pcDNA alone. the two clones expressed the HE protein at a low, but significant level compared to BHK-21 cells transfected by the control vector pcDNA. pBAC-OC43-HE mutants produced detectable amounts of infectious HCoV-OC43 particles compared to BHK-21 cells transfected by control vector pcDNA. pcDNA-HE or the pcDNA-HEv5 are vectors expressing the wild-type HE protein, either alone or fused with a v5 epitope. this experimental approach led to a significant increase in cells producing viral antigens after transfection. transient expression of HCoV-OC43 wild-type HE protein is more efficient than stably expressing pBAC-HE mutants. expression of the wild-type HE protein after transfection of BHK-21 cells with either pcDNA-HE or pcDNA-HEv5. capacity of HCoV-OC43 to produce completely active HE protein would impact the capacity of the virus to produce new infectious particles that could disseminate in cell culture. at 48 h postinfection, wild-type virus had spread within the culture and viral S and N proteins were detected. at 48 h postinfection, wild-type virus had clearly disseminated to half of available neurons. the percentage of infected neurons was the same for the HE-complemented virus produced by the cotransfection of pcDNA-HE plus the pBAC-OC43-HEstop molecular clone. the percentage of infected neurons was the same for the HE-complemented virus produced by the cotransfection of pcDNA-HE and the pBAC-OC the results are representative of three independent experiments. the HE protein may enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of susceptible human cells. a fully functional HE protein plays an important role in the production of detectable levels of infectious HCoV-OC43 particles. the precise role of the HE protein of betacoronaviruses in general remains elusive. the precise role of the HE protein of betacoronaviruses in general, and of HCoV-OC43 in particular remains elusive. pBAC-OC43-HEstop-A1 was previously shown to strongly abrogate BCoV replication by up to a 1,000-fold (11). pBAC-OC43FL system previously used to identify specific amino acid residues as important molecular determinants of virus-induced neuropathogenesis (29, 30) and neuronal cell death (31, 32) has proven very stable since no mutations appeared in the S gene of recombinant HCoV-OC43 produced if a revertant with a different HE sequence is able to arise after two rounds of amplification on HRT-18 cells (P2) this indicates that viral particles must have been produced already after transfection of BHK-21 cells (P0) but at a level that was under the limit of detection. after several attempts at showing viral particles by electron microscopy, we were never able to observe viral particles in transfected BHK-21 cells. this probably could be due to the very low production recombinant viruses produced in the process of transfection would be able to infect surrounding BHK-21 cells, which are susceptible to HCoV-OC43 infection. a strong acetyl-esterase activity, related to the production of the HE protein, was already detectable at 24 h posttransfection. cells that produce the HE protein may also generate more newly produced infectious virus particles. HCoV-OC43 remained far less effective than wild-type HCoV-OC43 (rOC/ATCC) the HE protein possesses both sialic acid binding properties and an acetyl-esterase enzymatic activity. a fully enzymatically active HE could release the S protein from the 9-O-acetyl sialic acid on the cell surface. HCoV-OC43 and BCoV are closely related, as they share a 92% degree of nucleotide identity over the genome. this similarity increases to ca. 95% for the HE gene and protein alone (40) the HE protein was previously suggested to play a role in infection of susceptible cells. data obtained using a pseudotyped lentivirus system suggest that the absence of a fully enzymatically active HE protein reduces the amount of S protein incorporated in the viral membrane and therefore decreases viral infectivity. the present study clearly indicates for the first time that the O-acetyl-esterase activity of HE protein of an HCoV plays a significant and important role in producing infectious virions."}
