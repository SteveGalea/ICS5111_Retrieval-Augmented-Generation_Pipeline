{"summary": "Coronaviridae are divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. all three have been classified as one virus species called Alphacoronavirus 1. seropositivity rates are 20% to 60% in domestic cat population. FECV causes persistent infections of the gut with only minor or no clinical symptoms (16\u201318) feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the second biotype, causes a fatal systemic disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) it is now generally accepted that harmless FECVs evolve into highly pathogenic FIPVs by accumulating mutations in their genomes. three substitutions in the S gene were suggested to discriminate FIPVs from FECV (26\u201328) two of these changes were located in the fusion peptide (FP) and one in the heptad repeat 1 region of the S protein. it was proposed that these substitutions change the viral cell tropism. serotype II FECVs can be grown in cell culture and induce FIP. lack of corresponding serotype II FECVs limits use (15, 17) system overcomes limitation caused by inability to propagate field viruses in vitro. serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. vrecFCoV-II contains the full-length cDNA of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 (40) vaccinia virus vrecFECV-S79 contains the serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 S sequence in the backbone of the serotype I field isolate-derived cDNA. first, the 79-1146-derived sequences downstream of the S gene (3a, 3b, 3c, E, M, N, 7 vrecFCoV-II was modified to replace 79-1146-derived sequences. vrecFCoV-II-FECV3a-3 UTR and vrecFECV1b-3 UTR-S79 are shown. a schematic representation of recovered recFECV-S79 ORFs is shown. recombinant virus showed growth characteristics similar to those displayed by serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. plaque morphology of the recombinant virus was indistinguishable from that of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 in FCWF cells. successful recovery and in vitro cultivation of recombinant viruses (recFECV-S79) in feline cells led us to conclude that serotype I FECV field isolate-derived virus back FCWF cells with the supernatant of electroporated cells did not lead to a CPE. FECV-specific antigens could not be detected with a monoclonal antibody. a prominent band corresponding to the FECV structural M protein could be detected. cells were electroporated either with recFECV RNA or with PBS (mock) supernatants were harvested 24 h after electroporation and purified by two rounds of ultracentrifugation. a 5-l volume of purified particles was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions. intensity of each band was compared to that of recFECV-S79 stock. we used a Western blot analysis to estimate the amount of M protein present in recFECV and recFECV-S79. the virus was known to produce infectious virus progeny following electroporation of viral genome RNAs. this was followed by two rounds of ultracentrifugation in a parallel experiment. recombinant serotype I FECVs could be recovered from the cDNA clone. recombinant virus particles with serotype II spike enabled efficient infection of cat cells. the authentic FECV spike did not allow the virus to grow and spread in a cell monolayer in vitro. fecal swab samples were collected from each cat on a daily basis. blood samples were collected weekly to monitor FCoV-specific antibodies. fecal swab samples from the cats infected intraperitoneally (cats 1 and 4) remained positive for about 1 week. qRT-PCR assay used to reevaluate 16 fecal samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 1 week p.i. two samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 1 week p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR also tested positive using qRT-PCR assay. titers were determined for cats 1 to 4 weekly from serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence. cat 3 was infected oronasally with the same virus. serum antibody responses were found to be similar for the two cats infected with recFECV. recombinant serotype I FECV recovered from a full-length cDNA clone induced a symptomless but persistent infection in the cats. the experiments revealed that, regardless of the route of infection, the recombinant FECVs caused persistent infections in the gut. nested RT-PCR revealed that FCoV-specific antigens could be detected only in the colon samples. the results were in complete agreement with the outcome of the nested RT-PCR assay. the full-length FECV genome sequence originating from cat 1 (recFECV-cat1) was determined by comparing the FECV sequences derived from viral RNA isolated from fecal samples. six nonsynonymous mutations were found in the S gene, two in the M gene, and one in nsp4. fecal samples from a clinically healthy cat with a long-term history of FECV shedding were collected. the full-length genomic sequence was determined by sequence analyses of overlapping reverse transcription-PCR fragments amplified from viral RNA. the 29,298-nucleotide (nt) genome of the serotype I FECV field isolate had the typical genome organization of FCoVs. serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. recombinant vaccinia virus vrecFECV-S79 contains full-length cDNA. vrecFCoV-II contains the serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 S sequence in the backbone of the serotype I field isolate-derived cDNA. the 79-1146-derived sequences downstream of the S gene were replaced by the corresponding parts of the FECV field isolate cDNA. serotype II-derived 5\u2032UTR and open reading frame 1a sequences were removed from the cDNA and the serotype II ORF1b was replaced by the corresponding FECV part. the sequence of the full-length FCoV cDNA inserted into the vaccinia virus genome was verified by sequence analysis. recFECV-S79 and serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. vaccinia virus DNA derived from vrecFECV-S79 was prepared, cleaved with ClaI restriction enzyme. the in vitro-transcribed RNA was electroporated into BHK cells. after 24 h of incubation, the supernatant was harvested. serotype I FECV field isolate-derived virus backbone is fully functional. serotype I FECV field isolate-derived virus backbone is fully functional. serotype II S sequence in vrecFECV-S79 was replaced with appropriate S gene from the FECV field isolate. a prominent band corresponding to the FECV structural M protein could be detected, corroborating the release of recFCoV particles from the transfected cells. for this purpose, purified particles were subjected to RNase treatment to remove any free viral RNA prior to RNA extraction. the intensity of each band was compared to that of the recFECV-S79 stock. recombinant serotype I FECVs were recovered from the full-length cDNA clone generated in the current study. the pellet fractions were resuspended in identical volumes of NTE buffer. equal amounts of the purified recFECV and recFECV-S79 stocks were subjected to Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. recFECV and recFECV-S79 virions could be recovered from cells in passage 0 without further amplification by viral passaging in permissive cells. the recombinant viruses were used to assess their ability to establish infection in the natural host. cal swab samples were collected from each cat on a daily basis. blood samples were collected weekly to monitor FCoV-specific antibody responses. fecal swab samples from the cats infected with recFECV remained positive for about 1 week. swabs obtained from cat 4 contained 2.3 103 and 1 104 genome copies. the remaining samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 4 weeks p.i. tested positive by nested RT-PCR. the remaining samples from cats 3 and 4 that had tested negative remained also negative by the qRT-PCR assay. titers against recFECV were determined using type I FCoV-infected CRFK cells. recFECV-S79 titers were measured using type II FCoV-infected cells. serum antibodies reached peak titers of >1:20,480 at 3 weeks p.i. two additional cats were infected oronasally in a separate experiment. recombinant FECVs caused persistent infections in the gut. fecal swab samples tested positive throughout the course of infection. an immunohistochemistry study revealed that FCoV-specific antigens could be detected only in samples originating from the colon. these data are in agreement with the localization of FECV nucleic acid and proteins reported for naturally occurring persistent FECV infections. recFECV generated in this study is able to establish persistent infections similar to those caused by FECVs from the field. data showed that the genomic sequence of the input recFECV was barely altered after 8.5 weeks (61 days) and that most of the changes were located in the S gene. similar results were also obtained in another study after resequencing full-length FCoV genomes several weeks postinfection (50). differences between the genomes of FECVs and FIPVs have been identified by comparative sequence analyses of FECVs and FIPVs. recombinant viruses with known genome sequences, along with a set of genetically engineered mutants derived from this particular parental virus, have to be generated by reverse genetics. the lack of suitable cell culture systems also posed a major obstacle in the development of reverse genetics approaches for these viruses. recombinant FECVs were generated using a two-step strategy. first, we sought to confirm that the serotype I FECV-derived backbone enables efficient viral replication if combined with the S gene of the serotype II FIPV strain 79-1146. resulting chimeric virus, recFECV-S79, could be rescued and grown to high titers in vitro. cats were infected with recFECV or recFECV-S79 using equal amounts of virus. in the two groups, the virus was applied oronasally to one cat and intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the other. infection with recFECV resulted in continuous virus shedding. recFECV has established a persistent infection of the colon. we determined the recFECV sequence from fecal samples collected right before the cat was euthanized. the sequence analysis revealed that the majority of nonsynonymous nucleotide changes mapped to the S gene. the structure of the recFECV S1 subunit is presented in purple (surface view) the receptor-binding edge is shown in red. the structure of the recFECV S1 subunit was modeled using protein homology/analogy recognition engine V 2.0. ally with recFECV-S79 tested positive for FECV by PCR and IHC. the efficient rescue of recFECV and its ability to cause a persistent enteric infection in cats represent a milestone in FCoV biology research. fetus whole-fetus 4 (FCWF-4) cells and monkey kidney (CV-1) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. all cell lines used in this study were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) selection of recombinant vaccinia viruses was performed as described previously. two rounds of selection were applied to exchange region from ORF3 to 3\u2032UTR of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. plasmid pGPT-ORF3-3 UTR was used to construct vaccinia virus vrecFCoV-II-FECV-3a-3 UTR. vrecFCoV-II-FECV-3a-3 UTR was used for vaccinia virus-mediated recombination with plasmid pGpt-ORF1b. pGem-T contains 500 nt of the vaccinia virus genome downstream of the FCoV cDNA and downstream of nt 24811 to 29298 of the serotype I FECV field isolate genome. vrecFECV-1b-3 UTR-S79 was used for vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination with plasmid pGPT-FECV-ORF1a. this plasmid contains sequences corresponding to 500 nt of the vaccinia virus genome upstream of the FCoV cDNA followed by nt 1 to 3500 of the FECV field isolate genome downstream of the GPT gene. plasmid pFECV-S is based on pGem-T and contains nt 19917 to 25210 of the serotype I FECV field isolate genome. for the recovery of recombinant FCoVs, a BHK-21 cell line expressing the FECV field isolate N protein was generated (BHK-Tet/ON-NFECV) the supernatant of electroporated cells containing recombinant FCoVs was harvested after 24 h of incubation. half of the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min to remove cell debris. then, recombinant FCoVs were purified by two rounds of ultracentrifugation. the grids were examined with a Zeiss EM 910 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. images were taken using a side-mounted charge-coupled-device camera. a capsid protection assay was performed to detect genomic RNA in purified recombinant viruses. l of purified virus was digested with 100 ng RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. reaction mixture was supplemented with 40 U RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT, Invitrogen) RNA was extracted from fecal swab samples with a QIAamp viral RNA Minikit. RNAs observed after the capsid protection assay were used for qRT-PCR. vrecFECV DNA was used as a template to amplify a 550-nt-long PCR product covering part of the ORF1b sequence using a forward primer. the PCR product was gel purified and in vitro transcribed with RiboMAX RNA Production System-T7 (Promega) the RNA concentration was determined with nanoVue (GE Healthcare) one animal in each group was inoculated intraperitoneally. the other cat was infected oronasally with supernatant of electroporated cells. fecal swab samples were subjected to RNA extraction. Coronavirus antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RNA extraction followed by nested RT-PCR (72) and qRT-PCR (72) as well as immunohistochemistry to identify sites of FECV replication. recFECV-S79 was propagated and purified in FCWF-4 cells. recombinant vaccinia viruses were propagated and purified as described previously. the previously produced vrecFCoV-II strain was modified. plasmid pGPT-ORF3-3 UTR is based on pGPT-1 (69) and contains sequences corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 24295 to 24794 of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 and 500 nt of the vaccinia virus genome downstream of the FCoV cDNA. vrecFCoV-II-FECV-3a-3 UTR-S79 contains ORF1b, previously generated vrecFCoV-II-FECV-3a-3 UTR was used for vaccinia virus-mediated recombination with plasmid pGPT-FECV-ORF1a. plasmid pFECV-ORF1b contains 500 nt of the vaccinia virus genome upstream of the FCoV cDNA and nt 20436 to 20935 of the type II FCoV strain 79-1146 genome vrecFECV-S79 was used for vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination with plasmid pGPT-S. plasmid contains sequences corresponding to nt 19917 to 20416 and nt 24811 to 25210 of the serotype I FECV field isolate genome upstream and downstream of the GPT gene. a line expressing the FECV field isolate N protein was generated (BHK-Tet/ON-NFECV) cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the N protein of a serotype I FECV field isolate. expression of FECV field isolate N protein was determined by Western blotting 24 h after addition of doxycycline (5 g/ml) to the culture medium. recombinant FCoV particles were purified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. the virus was pelleted through a 30% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion. resuspended in NTE buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris, 0.001 M EDTA) proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) after blocking, the membrane was washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibody F51-1 (monoclonal mouse anti-FCoV-M; kind gift from T. Hohdatsu) for 1 h at room temperature. vrecFECV DNA was used as a template to amplify a 550-nt-long PCR product covering part of the ORF1b sequence. a 10-l PCR mixture was used per reaction and contained 2.5 l of 4 TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step master mix. the reverse transcription step (50\u00b0C for 5 min) and the enzyme activation step (95\u00b0C for 20 s) were followed by 45 cycles. the in vitro-transcribed RNA was treated with DNase I and purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) the RNA concentration was determined with nanoVue (GE Healthcare) ten-fold serial dilutions of the RNA were made over a range of 11 log units (1011 to 101) indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to determine serum antibody titers. serum samples were added in 2-fold dilutions starting at 1:10. the binding of primary antibodies could be detected using an anti-cat conjugate. s were visualized by adding 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. control consisted either of a lymph node of a cat (positive control) or of a control created by replacing the primary antibody by a monoclonal antibody directed against chicken lymphocytes."}
