{"summary": "there are no vaccines for treating or preventing HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections. annual infection rates for influenza virus are between 5 and 20%. yearly death rate worldwide lies between 250,000 and 500,000 according to WHO estimates. the only vaccine in use is the (live) bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. the only vaccine in use is the (live) bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin. intranasal or intraoral vaccination of mice with MVTT-S produced 20- to 100-fold higher neutralizing antibody levels than MVA-S. but another study employed a mouse ocular challenge model to demonstrate that an attenuated replicating virus, but not a replication-defective HSV-1 strain, elicited a protective immune response (25). a virus vector that replicated in a controlled manner with nearly the same efficiency as the respective wild-type virus (referred the backbone virus must be selected from the group of viruses having a double-stranded DNA genome (e.g., herpesviruses) or producing a double-stranded DNA intermediate during replication and utilizing the host machinery for transcription. a virus in which two replication-essential genes are placed under the control of such a promoter could be activated to undergo one round of localized replication by administration of a mild heat dose. gene switch is inactivated by withdrawal of the SMR or virus-mediated lysis of the host cell. one or two replication-essential genes are subjected to regulation by such a heat- and SMR-dependent gene switch. the TA gene is controlled by a promoter cassette containing an HSP70B promoter and a TA-responsive promoter. single-step growth experiment for HSV-GS7 in vero cells. heat, exposure to 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min immediately after infection. Ulipristal, 10 nM ulipristal added to the medium at the time of initial infection. the two-component HSP promoter-based gene switch employed in the vectors relied on the transactivator GLP65, which is activated by a narrow class of antiprogestins. the transactivator is activated by a narrow class of antiprogestins, including mifepristone and ulipristal (31, 33\u201335) the recombinant replicated nearly as efficiently as the wild-type virus, 17syn+. the recombinant replicated approximately as well as HSV-GS3 following heat treatment in the presence of antiprogestin ulipristal (35). no replication was observed after either heat or antiprogestin treatment or in the absence of any treatment. an ICP4 replication-incompetent HSV-1 recombinant was administered under anesthesia to the plantar surfaces of both rear feet of adult Swiss Webster outbred female mice. three hours after inoculation, the animals were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of the HSV-1 wild-type strain 17syn+ administered by the same route as the original virus inoculum. survival of the animals was followed until no more lethal endpoints were reached, i mouse of either the ICP4 HSV-1 replication-incompetent recombinant KD6 or the HSV-1 replication-competent controlled recombinant HSV-GS3 received a 43.5\u00b0C/30-min heat treatment 3 h after virus inoculation in the systemic presence of mifepristone. at 22 days postimmunization, all the mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17 heat treatment alone or ulipristal alone did not significantly increase the protective effect over that produced by the unactivated virus. in this experiment the virus inoculum was 500,000 PFU rather than 50,000 PFU. this may account for the somewhat elevated level of protection induced by unactivated HSV-GS3 and KD6. a second experiment in which mice were immunized with 50,000 PFU/mouse of HSV-GS3 and were not boosted. a further group was mock immunized with saline. at 21 days, the animals in the HSV-GS3 groups were boosted with another 500,000-PFU/mouse dose of HSV-GS3. 40 HSV- GS3 50 3 (10) 4 (10) 3 (10) 1 (20) 11 (50)/22 + 6 (10) 7 (10) 6 (10) 14 (20) 33 (50)/66 + + 8 (10)/80 500. /second immunization was with same virus dose that was used for initial immunization. +, indicated treatment was administered; \u2013, treatment was not administered. data relating to incomplete activation (heat treatment only, or antiprogestin only) were omitted. mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn+. the data are presented as percent survival for each treatment group. the data are presented as averaged percentages of HSV-1 PFU neutralized for each group plus standard deviations. the number of HSV-1-specific lymphocytes induced 3 weeks after immunization was determined by a limiting dilution lymphocyte proliferation assay. three blood/PBMC samples were analyzed per group. groups (n = 5) of 6- to 8-week old female BALB/c mice were inoculated with either saline (mock), HSV-GS3 (50,000 PFU), or HSV-GS11 (50,000 PFU) and subjected to the same treatments as for panel B. mice were harvested 24 h after the last treatment. activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 provided similar levels of protection. the protective effect of either recombinant was modest. in secondarily infected cells, HSV-GS3 all but lacked ICP4 expression. the immune system was sufficiently sensitive to detect the very low levels of viral antigen expression occurring in cells secondarily infected with HSV-GS3. a second activation treatment applied 2 days after the first treatment or a second immunization would further enhance protective immunity. the second immunization was administered 3 weeks after the initial virus application. the difference in immunization efficacy between activated and unactivated HSV-GS7 was found to be highly significant. also significant was the increase in protection afforded by a second immunization with an activated HSV-GS7 vector. the effect of the second activation 2 days after virus administration was not statistically relevant. both unactivated HSV-GS vectors and KD6 virus were found to be capable of inducing detectable levels of HSV-1-specific responder cells. substantially better responses were produced by activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7. recombinant HSV-GS11 was constructed to evaluate immune responses to a heterologous antigen expressed from an HSV-GS vector. HA-specific responder cells were not detected in unimmunized, mock-immunized, or vector-immunized animals. HA-specific responder cells were not detected in unimmunized or mock-immunized animals. an activated vector (HSV-GS3) produced a similar response. the two-component HSP promoter-based gene switch employed in the vectors relied on the transactivator GLP65. the replication-essential immediate-early gene RS1/ICP4 and the early gene UL29/ICP8 had been placed under gene switch control by replacing its promoter with GAL4-responsive promoters. recombinant replicated approximately as well as HSV-GS3 following heat treatment in the presence of antiprogestin ulipristal. no replication was observed after either heat or antiprogestin treatment or in the absence of any treatment. in the first experiment, the virus vector HSV-GS3 or KD6 was administered under anesthesia to the plantar surfaces of both rear feet of adult female mice. the animals of one of the HSV-GS3 groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight mifepristone. survival of the animals was followed until no more lethal endpoints were reached, i.e., until all surviving animals fully recovered. mice were inoculated with 50,000 PFU/mouse of either the ICP4 HSV-1 replication-incompetent recombinant KD6 or the HSV-1 replication-competent controlled recombinant HSV-GS3. at 22 days postimmunization, all the mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn+ applied to both rear feet. ulipristal was used instead of mifepristone because the former compound is a more active gene switch coactivator than the latter compound. heat treatment alone or ulipristal alone did not significantly increase the protective effect over that produced by the unactivated virus. this may account for the somewhat elevated level of protection induced by unactivated HSV-GS3 and KD6. GS3 group received a 45\u00b0C/10-min heat treatment 3 h after inoculation in the systemic presence of ulipristal (50 g/kg administered i.p. at the time of inoculation) the second group received only heat treatment [HSV-GS3 (uli only)], the third group was administered only ulipristal [HSV-GS3 (uli only)], and the fourth group was left untreated [HSV-GS3 (un 2 (10)/20 + 4 (10)/40 HSV- GS3 50 3 (10) 4 (10) 3 (10) 1 (20) 11 (50)/22 + 6 (10) 7 (10) 6 (10) 14 (20) 33 (50)/66 + + 8 (10)/80 500 + 4 (10) 4 (10)/40 + + 8 (10) 8 (10)/80 + + 8 (10) 8 (10)/80 HSV-GS7 5 0 (10) 0 (10) 0 (30)/0 + 5 Boost/second immunization was with same virus dose that was used for initial immunization. +, indicated treatment was administered; \u2013, treatment was not administered. data relating to incomplete activation (heat treatment only, or antiprogestin only) were omitted. -GS7 groups were untreated (unactivated; n = 20); activated on day 1 (3 h after virus inoculation) by heat treatment at 45\u00b0C for 10 min in the presence of ulipristal (50 g/kg administered i.p. at the time of inoculation) twenty-one days after the last treatment, all the mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn+. the number of HSV-1-specific lymphocytes induced 3 weeks after immunization was determined by a limiting dilution lymphocyte proliferation assay. groups (n = 5) of 6- to 8-week old female BALB/c mice were inoculated with either saline (mock), HSV-GS3 (50,000 PFU) or HSV-GS11 (50,000 PFU) and subjected to the same treatments as for panel B. GS3-immunized animals could have been due to the efficient virus replication triggered by the activation of the genes for the major transcription regulator ICP4. abundant viral gene expression in secondarily infected cells (which may include antigen-presenting cells) could further enhance the immune response. a second immunization further enhances protective immunity. we investigated whether a second activation treatment applied 2 days after the first treatment would further enhance protection against wild-type virus challenge. a second activation followed by virus activation had no apparent effect. the difference in immunization efficacy between activated and unactivated HSV-GS7 was found to be highly significant. also significant was the increase in protection afforded by a second immunization with an activated HSV-GS7 vector. the effect of the second activation 2 days after virus administration was not statistically relevant. SV-1-specific responder cells present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified by a modified limiting dilution lymphoproliferation assay. both unactivated HSV-GS vectors and KD6 virus were found to be capable of inducing detectable levels of HSV-1-specific responder cells. HA-specific responder cells were not detected in unimmunized, mock-immunized, or vector-immunized animals. HA-specific responder cells present in PBMCs were quantified by the same type of responder cell frequency (RCF) assay. induction of a cellular immune response was observed in animals immunized with once- or twice-activated HSV-GS11. the once-activated replication-competent controlled HSV-1 recombinants HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induced considerably more potent protective immune responses than the replication-defective strain KD6. a second activation treatment administered 2 days after the initial activation of a replication-competent controlled HSV-1 vector did not consistently enhance the protective immune response against challenge by the wild-type virus. a second activation treatment administered 2 days after the initial activation of a replication-competent controlled HSV-1 vector did not consistently enhance the protective immune response against challenge by the wild-type virus from which the vector was derived. several ligand-dependent transactivators may be considered for incorporation in such a gene switch. they include transactivators that are derived from the bacterial tetracycline repressor or other bacterial repressors. they include chimeric transactivators that exploit ligand-binding domains of various steroid receptors. s have been safety tested in human subjects and are readily available. they are not considered essential active ingredients by the WHO. the vectors may not be employed for immunization of healthy female subjects. a single round of replication of disseminated virus can be expected to result in significant toxicity. a single round of replication of disseminated virus can be expected to result in significant toxicity. a single round of replication of disseminated virus can be expected to result in significant toxicity. a clinical trial was conducted that investigated a DISC virus as a therapeutic vaccine against recurrent genital herpes (50) the results were negative. a single ulipristal dose can be administered orally at the time of immunization. the pads are capable of maintaining a temperature of 45\u00b0C for 15 min. mifepristone was a gift from E. Wagner and was propagated in minimal essential medium with 5% heat-inactivated calf serum. stocks of mifepristone were titrated using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays. cetate was from D-Innovation Pharmaceutical Inc., Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. all the viruses were constructed using wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn+. pBS-KS:UL38promoter was digested with AatII and HindIII. the resulting 4,285-bp fragment was gel purified and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. RS cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38. plasmid NK470 was subcloned into pBS containing the region spanning the HSV-1 UL37/UL38 intergenic region from nucleotides (nt) 83603 to 84417. cassette containing a synthetic CMV IE promoter flanked by the pBS-SK+ MCS was ligated into pBS:UL37/38 digested with BspE1/AflII to yield pBS: cotransfected cells were exposed to 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. on days 2 and 3, the cells were again incubated at 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then returned to 37\u00b0C. plasmid pVP19c was constructed by PCR cloning of promoter. fluent E5 cells transfected 24 h prior to infection with the expression vector pVP19c using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) Plaques were visualized 2 days after infection using an antibody plaque assay, essentially as previously described. heat treatment was performed by immersion of the hind limbs in a temperature-controlled water bath 3 h after virus administration. mice were challenged by infection on both rear footpads with 10,000 PFU, typically, of HSV-1 strain 17syn+. at 3 weeks after immunization, mice from each group were anesthetized by inhalation of 2 to 3% isoflurane. the total blood volume of each mouse was collected, and the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. wells of 96-well plates were coated with 20 l/well of antigen extract. each well contained a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 lymphocytes per well. after 24 h, medium containing 10 Ci of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. the mice were sacrificed 24 h after heat induction. the feet were dissected and snap-frozen in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich) the extracted DNA was subjected to TaqMan real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) plasmid pBS-EIVPrague56/HA was expressed in Escherichia coli. proteins were used to coat a 96-well ELISA plate, which was allowed to air dry. the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the wells were washed 2 times. no data sets that were analyzed for statistical significance varied in sample size by more than 3-fold. animal studies were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) infected cultures were subjected to daily heat treatment at 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min for three successive days. stocks of EIV were titrated using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays in MDCK cells. all the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 contains a GAL4 promoter inserted between the HSV-1 UL38 recombination arms of the plasmid pBS-KS:UL38promoter. the plasmid contains six copies of the yeast GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS), the adenovirus E1b TATA sequence, and the synthetic intron Ivs8. the resulting 473-b pBS-KS:UL38promoter was constructed by deletion of the region from 1 to 47 of the UL38 promoter, i.e., by synthesizing two PCR fragments (one 437 bp and the other 550 bp) on either side of the deletion and cloning them into pBS KS+. pBS:UL37/38 was digested from cDNA prepared from EIV Prague/56. cDNAs were cloned into pBS, and the clone containing the HA gene was confirmed by sequence analysis. the Prague/56 HA gene was subcloned and inserted behind the promoter in the plasmid pIN:UL37/38 to yield plasmid pIN:37/38-Prague56/HA.
