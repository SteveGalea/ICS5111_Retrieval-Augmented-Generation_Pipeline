{"summary": "around one-fourth of the 1415 pathogens known to infect humans appeared between 1940 and 2004. their appearance has gradually increased since 1980. seven new pathogens appear every year and this number should reach 15\u201320 by 2020. malaria is considered as the fifth human malaria agent after Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. however, monitoring is limited or impossible due to our poor knowledge about the ecology of these pathogens. the case of the Ebola virus is quite exemplary. the use of hematophagous flies as \u2018flying syringes\u2019 may constitute a new approach to track and survey blood-borne pathogens in the wild. the use of hematophagous flies as \u2018flying syringes\u2019 may constitute a new approach to track and survey blood-borne pathogens. tsetse flies, stomoxids and tabanids are easy to trap. 20 to 40% of trapped flies are engorged with blood. hematophagous flies feed on a large spectrum of vertebrate hosts. the number of engorged specimens and blood meals identified in each fly species is also indicated. the number of engorged specimens and blood meals identified in each fly species is also indicated. us 109 2.66 0 0 Tabanidae 485 11.83 3 1 Ancala sp 41 1 0 0 Atylotus sp 104 2.53 0 0 Chrysops sp 156 3.81 3 1 Haematopota sp 13 0.31 0 0 Tabanus par 52 1.27 0 0 Tabanus taeniola 120 2.93 0 0 Total 4099 100 1230 428. 4 Fsp5 Fsp8 Fsp1 Fsp2 Fsp3 Fsp4 Fsp4 Fsp5 Fsp6 Fsp7 Mammals Artiodactyla 295 1 4 3 8 1 1 7 1 14 2 1 2 3 3 4 1 3 Hominidae Gorilla gorilla 3 2 1 Homo sapiens 64 1 1 13 2 22 1 3 1 2 8 1 6 1 Testudines 16 Testunidae Kinix p 4 1 2 8 orders/12 families 20 species 428 3 1 11 4 41 2 2 16 4 89 1 6 7 18 7 16 11 11 22 6 25 1 2 Fsp1 = Glossina caliginea;

'xenorsurveillance' could complete recently developed methods based on analysis of other invertebrates. it could also help to better understand the circulation in wildlife of other enzootic viruses, such as viruses (chikungunya, Zika) around 60% of emerging diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin. the progressive reduction of wild habitats will increase the contacts between humans and species that are potential reservoirs of diseases. the LP is a private park dominated by large savannahs and some secondary forest and primary forest patches. sampling was done during two years following a gradient of human activity from primary forest to villages. in the other parks, flies were sampled during a single year. flies were dissected individually in a drop of phosphate buffered saline solution (1x DPBS) each hematophagous fly was dissected on a slide using one forceps and one scalpel that were changed each time to avoid contaminations. each blood meal was transferred in a 1.5-ml microtube containing 50 l of RNAlater stabilization solution. the thermal cycling conditions consisted of 3.5 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 30s at 95\u00b0C, 50s at 58\u00b0C, and 40s at 72\u00b0C. a 330 bp and/or a 660 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxydase subunit I (COI) gene was amplified using previously described primers and protocols. positive samples were sent to Beckman Coulter Genomics (France) for sequencing in both directions ( the ML model used for construction of the tree was GTR (General Time Reversible)+ (Gamma distribution)+I (Invariable site distribution). the ML model used for construction of the tree was GTR (General Time Reversible)+ (Gamma distribution)+I (invariable site distribution).

PCR products were checked on 1.5% agarose gels before shipment to EUROFINS MWG (Germany) for sequencing in both directions (reverse and forward) after purification.
