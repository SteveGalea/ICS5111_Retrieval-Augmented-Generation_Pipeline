{"summary": "influenza is an important cause of annual morbidity and mortality that can be prevented with vaccination. 5 Influenza virus infections contribute substantially to the annual burden of respiratory illness in temperate regions of the globe. there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that this is also the case in tropical regions. the surveillance system in Abidjan was expanded to 14 sites in 2007. twelve additional sites were added during 2008 through 2010, of which five were located in abidjan. nine were located in the interior of the country with an emphasis on the eastern region. 5074 NP specimens were analyzed for the detection of influenza viruses. all sentinel specimens (n = 867) were tested using viral culture. viral culture was also performed on a subset of RTPCRpositive cases to have influenza viruses available for antigenic characterization. influenza viruses were detected in culture using the ELISA immunocapture method. a hemmaglutination test with 05% red blood cells of chicken was performed on the culture supernatant after 48 hours of incubation. from 2008, cell culture was performed on only the positive samples in RTPCR. three multiplex heminested RTPCR assays were carried out as described by BellauPujol S et al. for the detection of other respiratory viruses, 12 targeting the following 12 RNA respiratory viruses simultaneously. influenzapositive specimens were sent either to the Institute Pasteur in Paris or to the WHO Collaborating Centers in Atlanta and/or London for more advanced analysis. the surveillance data were analyzed to evaluate temporal trends in the number of ILI cases and the percent of those cases testing positive for influenza at the sentinel sites. the first seven healthcare centers that were selected to be sentinel surveillance sites were located in the city of Abidjan. these sites were selected using the following criteria: geographic representation within Abidjan; adequate throughput of patients consulting at the health facility; the existence of a department of general medicine, a pediatric department, and a laboratory; the accessibility of the site; and availability of a refrigerator (+4\u00b0C) for the storage of specimens. virocult swabs were collected from each ILI case using virocult swabs (Medical Wire and Equipment, UK) and stored in a sterile cryovial containing a viral transport medium (VTM) Specimens were kept at +4\u00b0C following collection and during transport. a subset of respiratory specimens was collected within 3 days of first symptom onset. of the 1782 respiratory specimens collected from patients aged 0\u20135 years, 470 were selected for this multipathogen testing. virus isolation All the 867 specimens collected during the years 2003\u20132007, and the 757 specimens selected for virus isolation from 2008 to 2010 were inoculated on Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells. in a final volume of 50 l with 5 l RNA, 06 m each primer, 4 U RNase inhibitor and 1 l enzyme mix. the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and A(H5N1) viruses were amplified with specific primers using a protocol developed by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. the rRTPCR assays targeted the M gene for the detection of typeA influenza virus and the HA gene, for specific detection of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and influenza A(H3N2) viruses. age was categorized based on the age groups 0\u20134, 5\u201319, 20\u201339, 40\u201354 and >55 years. chisquared tests comparing the percentage of sentinel specimens testing positive by viral culture versus molecular diagnostic techniques. the age of the population enrolled in the sentinel surveillance system ranged from 1 month to 89 years. the 0\u20134year age group represented 52% (2524/4848) of 4848 ILI cases with known age. the sex ratio was 14:10 (male/female) sentinel ILI cases were most comprehensively detected and tested every month. peaks in the percent of sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza during may, June, and October. the primary peaks in May and June appear to correlate with the rainy season. seasonal influenza A(H1N1), 382 (616%) as influenza A(H3N2), and 62 (100%) as pandemic (H1N1)2009 viruses. influenza A viruses cocirculated with influenza A viruses during each year from 2004 to 2010. influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus represented 120% of all influenza viruses detected and no seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses were detected.
