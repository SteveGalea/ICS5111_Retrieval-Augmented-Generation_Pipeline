{"summary": "the global Virome Project seeks to make data available to public health agencies that face undiagnosed illness. the project will use artificial intelligence across the largest viral data set ever assembled. the scale of the project\u2019s viral testing will also enable piloting and enhancing novel testing platforms technologies. the project is ambitious but feasible, enabled by technological developments that allow for rapid and affordable genetic and viral sequencing. in the past, the human Genome Project sequenced and mapped the human genome, starting with a focus on the genes with the greatest relevance to people. the ultimate success of the project is in the medical advances made after the project\u2019s conclusion. influenza pandemics are estimated to cause an average of US$ 570 billion in economic damages per year to the global economy. the global Virome Project will cost US$ 1.2 billion, less than 0.2% of this estimated loss4 and less than the estimated US$2.2 billion loss in gross domestic product due to forgone economic growth."}
