{"summary": "TNF- is a cytokine that plays opposing roles in the context of infectious disease pathogenesis. the promoter, an integral upstream regulatory region of a gene, controls the initiation of gene transcription as well as the level of gene expression. the technique of polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used to detect 791(CT) mutations in the TNF- promoter and to determine the mRNA expression levels for TNF-. the technique was used to assess the feasibility of using the 791(C > T) mutation as a genetic marker. the piglets were identified as E. coli F18-susceptible. when no adherence was displayed the piglets were identified as E. coli F18-resistant. reaction mixture (20 L) contained 100 ng of DNA, 5 pmoL of each primer, 10 L of PCR Master Mix (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), and sterilized distilled water. PCR protocol consisted of 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 63\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s, and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. electrophoresis was detected in agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. the SSCP of the PCR products was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. oligo-dT (a short sequence of deoxythymine nucleotides), 0.5 L of random hexamers, 500 ng of total RNA, and RNase-free H2O. the reaction was done at 37\u00b0C for 15 min and then 5 s at 85\u00b0C. a melting temperature peak at 85 0.8\u00b0C was used to determine the specificity of the amplification. the 2Ct method (16) was used to analyze the real-time PCR results: Ct = ( average cycle threshold [ Ct ] value of the target gene in the tested group. t-test was used to determine differences in mRNA expression, or immune index. piglets were identified as E. coli F18-susceptible (Figure 1A) whereas when no adherence was displayed the piglets were identified as E. coli F18-resistant (Figure 1B). the genes for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TATA box-binding protein 1 and -actin were used as internal controls. the reaction mixture (20 L) contained 100 ng of DNA, 5 pmoL of each primer, 10 L of PCR Master Mix (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), and sterilized distilled water. the PCR products were confirmed by electrophoresis in agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. the SSCP of the PCR products was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PCR products of different homozygotes were sequenced in an automatic DNA sequencer. synthesis contained 2 L of 5 PrimerScript buffer, 0.5 L of PrimerScript RT Enzyme Mix I, 0.5 L of random hexamers, 500 ng of total RNA, and RNase-free H2O. the reaction was done at 37\u00b0C for 15 min and then 5 s at 85\u00b0C. p = P + H/2, q = Q + H/2, x2 = d2/e; d = e o, which is the difference between the predicted and obtained values. data were expressed as mean standard deviation. expression levels in the spleen, lung, thymus, and lymph node tissues were high in both the ETEC F18-resistant and the ETEC F18-susceptible animals. SSCP analysis revealed 3 genotypes: CC, CT, and TT. CC genotype was defined as the wild type. TT genotype had a C/T substitution mutation at nucleotide 791. the sequence was identical to that in GenBank (accession no. X54859). the CC genotype was defined as the wild type. TT genotype had a C/T substitution mutation at nucleotide 791. the expression of TNF-, which depends on environmental stressors, triggers inflammation and apoptosis. the expression of TNF- mRNA in the immune system (in spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes) and in the lungs. the immune system confers resistance against infections. the high levels of TNF- mRNA expression in the immune system were attributed to the biofunctions of TNF-. in piglets infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, TNF- inhibited the replication of PRRSV. TT genotype of TNF- 791(CT) may contribute to higher levels of TNF- expression in intestinal tissue (duodenum) and immune tissues (spleen and lymph nodes) this mutation could be considered as a potential genetic marker for ETEC F18 resistance in piglets of the Large White breed."}
