{"summary": "phloem-restricted RNA viruses transmitted by aphids. ingested virions cross the aphid gut and salivary gland epithelial barriers. CP and RTD are essential for aphid transmission. peptides that bind to the gut epithelium of the pea aphid could reduce the amount of virus present in the hemocoel to less-than-threshold levels. in subsequent work, the peptide was shown by UV-cross-linking to bind to pea aphid APN (7). the authors suggested that Rack-1, GAPDH3 and actin function in endocystosis and intracellular transport but are not actual virus receptors. the authors suggested that Rack-1, GAPDH3 and actin function in endocystosis and intracellular transport. MV is transmitted by at least 10 aphid species, the pea aphid and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. this is the most important vectors of this virus resulting in the most severe impacts on crop yield (17). the goal of our research was to provide in vitro support for identification of the receptor for PEMV. BBMV of adult A. pisum were prepared from whole aphids as described previously. final BBMV pellets were resuspended in ice-cold buffer. the pBAD/His B vector was used for the expression of GFP, R4-GFP (R4 peptide, amino acid sequence WCDQLLQQMQCW) and GFP-RTD. three oligonucleotides were used for integrating the RTD and GFP DNA sequences. the cDNA encoding the R4-GFP protein was generated by PCR. Schematic diagrams are shown for PEMV-1 RNA (at the top) and for wild-type (WT) PEMV and PEMV RNA1. the short remaining 5\u2032 sequence of the RTD in PEMV RNA1 is in a different reading frame and does not produce a translated protein product (22). the final pellets from 300 g of initial protein were resuspended in rehydration buffer. the protein was then applied to 7-cm Immobiline DryStrip gels for overnight rehydration. both pH 3 to 10 and pH 4 to 7 strips were used. erum (1:100) or GFP antiserum (1:5,000), followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000). antibody-only controls were run in parallel by eliminating incubation with the ligand (virus or GFP fusion) to identify nonspecific binding of the antibodies to aphid BBMV. a mixture of the refolded soluble 28-kDa fragment and PAGE gel slices containing the 67-kDa fragment were used for the production of antiserum. a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to clone pea aphid APN into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1(Invitrogen) the recombinant bacmids were generated according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR was used to confirm the presence of inserts. recombinant baculoviruses were plaque purified. two methods were used for the immunofluorescence assays. cells were seeded on microscope slides, washed once in PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. all washes and incubations were done using a Coplin jar. escence was visualized with a UV-2E/C filter (Nikon) with a 340- to 380-nm excitation and 435- to 485-nm emission. for the second method, the cells were seeded and infected on 12-mm glass coverslips. at 48 h postinfection, the cells were washed three times in insect PBS. cells were washed once in PBS and incubated with 10 g of CP-P-GFP or E. coli-expressed GFP/ml for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. cells were stained with 1:1,000 DAPI for 5 min and washed three times in PBS for 5 min per wash. controls included uninfected Sf9 cells and cells infected with vLacZ. whole guts from pea aphids were dissected in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail at a dilution of 1:100 (Sigma) the guts were gently mixed every 5 to 10 min. the guts were then washed seven times in PBS to remove unbound PEMV. APN pulled down with PEMV in test and control treatments. controls included streptavidin beads incubated with PEMV alone and beads incubated with aphid guts alone. analysis of interaction of APN-GPI() with CP-P-GFP, GFP, and RTD-GFP was performed by injecting proteins (6 M in HBS-N) at 30 l/min for 60 s, dissociation for 60 s, regeneration with 50 mM NaOH for 60 s, and stabilization for 120 s. BBMV of adult A. pisum were prepared from whole aphids as described previously. final BBMV pellets were resuspended in ice-cold buffer. the pBAD/His B vector was used for the expression of GFP, R4-GFP and GFP-RTD. three oligonucleotides were used for integrating the RTD and GFP DNA sequences. cDNA encoding the R4-GFP protein was generated by PCR using the forward primers R4SacIF and shGFP-R. matic diagrams are shown for PEMV-1 RNA (at the top) and for wild-type (WT) PEMV and PEMV RNA1. the short remaining 5\u2032 sequence of the RTD in PEMV RNA1 is in a different reading frame. reconstituted proteins were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 15,200 g for 5 min. the protein was then applied to 7-cm Immobiline DryStrip gels for overnight rehydration. both pH 3 to 10 and pH 4 to 7 strips were used. antibody-only controls were run in parallel by eliminating incubation with the ligand (virus or GFP fusion) to identify nonspecific binding of the antibodies to aphid BBMV. the experiments were replicated at least four times with each ligand. a mixture of the refolded 28-kDa fragment and PAGE gel slices containing the 67-kDa fragment were used for the production of antiserum. a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to clone pea aphid APN into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1(Invitrogen) recombinant bacmids were generated according to manufacturer's directions. recombinant baculoviruses were plaque purified and recombinant APN was expressed in baculovirus-infected cells according to standard procedures. at 48 h postinfection, cells were seeded on microscope slides, washed once in PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. after fixation, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PT buffer) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by blocking for 1 h in PT buffer containing 0.5% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C. the following day, the cells were washe uninfected cells and cells infected with vLacZ served as negative controls. cells were seeded on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates. cells were washed three times in insect PBS (1 mM sodium phosphate, 10.5 mM potassium phosphate, 140 mM sodium chloride, 40 mM potassium chloride [pH 6.2] on a shaker. cells were washed once in PBS and incubated with 10 g of CP-P-GFP or E. coli-expressed GFP/ml for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. cells were stained with 1:1,000 DAPI for 5 min and washed three times in PBS for 5 min per wash. controls included uninfected Sf9 cells and cells infected with vLacZ. the final concentration of the Sulfo-SBED in the reaction was 110 M. the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the guts were gently mixed every 5 to 10 min. ified APN antiserum was quantified using ImageJ analysis. controls included streptavidin beads incubated with PEMV alone, beads incubated with aphid guts alone. BBMV pulldown competition assays carried out as described previously (7). CP-P-GFP (50 nM) was incubated with BBMV in the presence of a 1,000-fold molar excess of a nonbinding control peptide R4-GFP. BBMV were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis, blotted to PVDF membranes, and overlaid with purified PEMV, coat protein-GFP fusion (CP-P-GFP), or the readthrough domain-GFP fusion (GFP-RTD; Fig. 1). wild-type PEMV, PEMV lacking the RTD (PEMV RNA1), and CP-P-GFP all bound specifically to an aphid protein of 150 k no binding was detected for the antibody (no ligand) control. arrows indicate consistent binding. PEMV was labeled with a biotin transfer reagent to UV cross-link proteins bound to PEMV. tin label was used to pull down the protein complex with streptavidin-linked agarose beads. the amount of APN pulled down in the presence of PEMV was significantly greater than in the absence of PEMV. the association of pea aphid APN with biotin confirms colocalization of PEMV with APN in the pea aphid gut. western blotting of membrane and soluble fractions confirmed baculovirus expression of recombinant APN in Sf9 cells. expression of recombinant APN at 48 h was detected using an anti-APN primary antibody and an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. images are representative of four experiments. the binding of CP-P-GFP (50 nM) was outcompeted by the addition of a 1,000-fold molar excess of GBP3.1-GFP (50 M) but not by excess of the nonbinding control peptide R4-GFP. at 50 nM, GBP3.1-GFP showed strong binding to the BBMV. fluorescence was not observed in cells incubated with CP-P-GFP. the gut binding peptide competes with CP-P-GFP for binding to BBMV. CP-p-GFP binding was out-competed by addition of excess GBP3.1-GFP. fluorescence was observed in the control treatments of Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus expressing LacZ and uninfected Sf9 cells. DAPI and intracellular GFP fluorescence were detected by the examination of multiple cell layers using a confocal microscope. wild-type PEMV, PEMV lacking the RTD (PEMV RNA1), and CP-P-GFP all bound specifically to an aphid protein of 150 kDa. this protein was isolated from coomassie blue-stained gels. four of the five hits identified by Mascot Search were to the same APN sequence. PEMV was labeled with a biotin transfer reagent to UV cross-link proteins bound to PEMV. the amount of APN pulled down by PEMV averaged 4.5-fold more than the control lacking PEMV across four replicates. the association of pea aphid APN with biotin confirms colocalization of PEMV with APN in the pea aphid gut. real-time binding of baculovirus-expressed APN without a GPI anchor, APN-GPI(), to CP-P-GFP, GFP-RTD, and GFP was quantified using SPR. Sf9 cells were infected with vAPN-GPI(+), vAPN-GPI(), or vLacZ as a control. expression of APN at 48 h was detected using an anti-APN primary antibody and an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. peptide was outcompeted by the addition of a 1,000-fold molar excess of GBP3.1-GFP (50 M) but not by excess of the nonbinding control peptide R4-GFP. a total of 50 ng of GFP protein was used as positive control. CP-P-GFP binding was out-competed by addition of excess GBP3.1-GFP. excess nonbinding peptide R4-GFP did not compete with CP-P-GFP for binding. CP-mediated entry into Sf9 cells expressing APN was observed by confocal microscopy. uninfected cells were incubated with CP-P-GFP or GFP. increased fluorescence was observed in Sf9 cells expressing recombinant APN. no fluorescence was observed when cells were incubated with GFP. the majority of the protein from whole aphid BBMV preparations would be derived from the gut and APN is localized to the gut (18). the majority of the protein from whole aphid BBMV preparations would be derived from the gut. the role glycans play, if any, in luteovirus-aphid interactions is unclear. there is a precedent for APN functioning as a virus receptor. there is a precedent for APN functioning as a virus receptor. the biological significance of the isoforms, if any, is unknown. GBP3.1 directly competes in vivo with PEMV virions. downstream effect of this would be reduced virus titer in the aphid hemocoel. CP-P-GFP and PEMV compete with GBP3.1-GFP. low efficacy and inconsistency of RNA interference in aphids prevented functional confirmation of APN as the receptor for PEMV by silencing in the pea aphid (41). current management of both aphids and aphid-transmitted plant viruses relies on chemical insecticides. knowledge of plant virus-vector molecular interactions allows for technologies to disrupt plant virus transmission. plant expression of peptides, such as GBP3.1, could be used to block plant virus transmission. western yellow virus are acquired through the midgut epithelium of M. persicae (28, 29) related viruses use different capsid protein domains and different receptors in the same vector (e.g., barley yellow dwarf virus, BYDV-RPV, and BYDV-PAV in the bird cherry-oat aphid) APN is estimated to comprise 15% of the total midgut protein in the pea aphid (18) this midgut localization is consistent with the role of APN as a gut receptor given that the midgut is the site for PEMV uptake (4) and that, based on activity levels, APN expression is relatively low in the hindgut (31). phid gut epithelium into the aphid hemocoel similar to PEMV. 5, both PEMV and CP-P-GFP bind APN in vitro. 6, CP-P-GFP competes with CP-P-GFP for binding in vitro. CP-P-GFP and PEMV compete with GBP3.1-GFP for receptor binding. recombinant APN on Sf9 cells mediates internalization of CP-P-GFP. the binding of wild-type PEMV (with virions composed of both CP and RTD) was specific in ligand blots for APN. this apparent anomaly may result from the relative abundance of the CP and CP-RTD proteins in the PEMV virion."}
