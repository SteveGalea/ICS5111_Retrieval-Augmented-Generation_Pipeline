{"summary": "mammalian defensins comprise three structural subfamilies called -, - and -defensins. all defensins are arginine rich, tridisulfide containing peptides. -defensins, which are half the size of - and -defensins, are macrocyclic molecules which have only been isolated from leukocytes of Old World monkeys. studies have shown an extracellular role for myeloid -defensins in regulating cellular activities including cell proliferation [17], [18], [19], neovascularization [20], [21], chemotaxis [22], and regulation of cytokines [23], [24] and signal transduction pathways [17], [19], [24], [25]. the prosegment in - and -defensin precursors is 45 amino acids in length, but azurophil granule proteases, NE and proteinase 3 (PR3) processed to mature peptides. proteases involved in maturation of human myeloid -defensins have not been identified. the proteases involved in maturation of human myeloid -defensins have not been identified. peaks A and B were detected with anti-His6 antibody confirming the presence of His6-proHNP1. proHNP1A and proHNP1B are differently folded forms of the recombinant protein. proHNP1A and proHNP1B were pooled separately and purified to homogeneity. the proHNP1 sequence shows the mature sequence (underlined) and the disulfide linkages between Cys residues and the Met residue (indicated with an asterisk) at the junction of the pro- and mature sequence. the numbers indicate the residue number in the preproHNP1 precursor. proHNP1 peptides were generated by CNBr cleavage of folded His6-proHNP1A and misfolded His6-proHNP1B. peptides were generated by CNBr cleavage of folded His6-proHNP1A and misfolded His6-proHNP1B. 1B (upper tracing) and His6-proHNP1A (lower tracing) resolved by C18 RP-HPLC. bar indicates fractions containing peptides consistent with that of folded/oxidized HNP1 and peaks marked with arrows were further purified by HPLC. microbicidal activity of native HNP1 (\u2022) or HNP1-peptides generated by CNBr-cleavage of His6-proHNP1A () and His6-proHNP1B () was determined in a standard bactericidal assay against S. aureus 502a. NE digestion of proRMAD4 precursor of rhesus myeloid -defensin-4 (RMAD4) converted proRMAD4 to reduction and alkylation produced a mass increase of 348 A.M.U. the peptides also co-migrated with native HNP1 on AU-gels. thus, NE and PR3 processing of His6-proHNP1 generated a peptide that was indistinguishable from natural HNP1. n-derived HNP1 3440.6 [3439.5] 3789.7 [3788.7] 349.1 [348] PR3-derived HNP1 3441.3 [3439.5] 3789.0 [3788.7] 347.7 [348] CG- derived HNP1b 3685.4 [3685.6] 4033.3 [4033.8] 347.9 [348] a Masses of natural and protease-derived eptide in the earlier peak was 3702.0 A.M.U., an increase of 16.2 A.M.U., corresponding to the sulfoxide derivative of methionine (theory = 16.0 A.M.U.) of Asn-Met-HNP1. CG-derived Asn-Met-HNP1 migrated as a single band on AU-PAGE, comigrating with native HNP1. serine proteases (Fig. 5), NE, PR3 or CG treatment of proHNP1B yielded no mature HNP1 or HNP1 derivatives in the digestion mixtures detectable by C18 RP-HPLC or MALDI-TOF MS. these results indicate that the correct fold and disulfide linkages in proHNP1 are required for processing of the precursor to mature peptide. ant from the nickel affinity column (Ni-eluant) contained a major band of 12 kDa. on reducing SDS-tricine PAGE, peaks A and B contained the 12 kDa band. both were detected with anti-His6 antibody confirming the presence of His6-proHNP1. enterokinase site and proHNP1 sequence in the his6-proHNP1 construct are shown. the numbers above indicate the number of amino acid residues in each segment. the numbers indicate the residue number in the preproHNP1 precursor. peptide in proHNP1 sequence offered a non-enzymatic approach to generate HNP1 from proHNP1. peptides were generated by CNBr cleavage of folded His6-proHNP1A and misfolded His6-proHNP1A. HNP1 generated by CNBr cleavage of His6-proHNP1B (upper tracing) and His6-proHNP1A (lower panel) were resolved by C18 RP-HPLC. bar indicates fractions containing peptides with molecular weight consistent with that of folded/oxidized HNP1. microbicidal activity of native HNP1 (\u2022) or HNP1-peptides generated by CNBr-cleavage of His6-proHNP1A () and His6-proHNP1B () was determined in a standard bactericidal assay against S. aureus 502a. NE digestion of proRMAD4 precursor of rhesus myeloid -defensin-4 (RMAD4) converted proRMAD4 to the identities of HNP1 derivatives were also confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS of each peptide following reduction and alkylation. reduction and alkylation produced a mass increase of 348 A.M.U. mass gain Native HNP1 3439.9 [3439.5] 3787.8 [3788.7] 347.9 [348] NE-derived HNP1 3440.6 [3439.5] 3789.7 [3788.7] 349.1 [348] PR3-derived HNP1 3441.3 [3439.5] 3789.0 [3788.7] 347.7 [348] CG-derived HNP1b 3685.4 [368 CG-derived Asn-Met-HNP1 migrated as single band on AU-PAGE. despite the heterogeneity observed, CG-derived Asn-Met-HNP1 migrated as single band on AU-PAGE, comigrating with native HNP1. analysis of Tag sequence effects on proHNP1 processing. NE, PR3 or CG treatment of proHNP1B yielded no mature HNP1 or HNP1 derivatives in the digestion mixtures detectable by C18 RP-HPLC or MALDI-TOF MS. these results indicate that the correct fold and disulfide linkages in proHNP1 are required for processing of the precursor to mature peptide. recombinant his6-proHNP1 was folded with native disulfide linkages. misfolded propeptide was readily converted to the folded form in buffer containing urea and reduced/oxidized glutathione (Fig. S1) the expression of folded and misfolded forms of proHNP1 allowed for the analysis of the structural requirements for HNP1-mediated bactericidal activity in vitro. NE and PR3 proteases that co-localize with myeloid -defensins, participate in the intracellular maturation of HNP1. proHNPs were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic/microsomal fraction, but the granule fraction contained only the intermediate and mature HNP [35]. misfolded His6-proHNP1B was disulfide-linked but still susceptible to proteolysis. proHNP1 could be processed by matrix metalloproteinase 7 to generate a 59-residue molecule with microbicidal activity. but no mature HNP1 (30 amino acids) was detected. plasmid PEC2081 encodes proHNP1 with a 41 amino acid residue N-terminal sequence containing the His6-tag (His6-proHNP1; Fig. 1). plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)(codon+), generating strain PEC2132-1 which was used for expression and purification of His6-proHNP1. the eluate was dialyzed in Spectrapor 3 membrane against 2 L of dialysis buffer. the dialysate was acidified by addition of acetic acid to 10% (vol/vol) and fractionated on a 10 mm250 mm Vydac C18 reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) column. the membrane was washed with TTBS and probed with goat anti-Fc mouse IgG-horse radish peroxidase conjugate (120,000 dilution; Sigma) for 1 h, washed with TTBS, and developed by incubation with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) the resulting chemiluminesence was visualized on x-ray film. enzymatic treatment of proHNP1 human NE, PR3 and CG were purchased from Elastin Products Company. CG reactions were performed in 50 l volumes containing 15 g His6-proHNP1 and 2 g of protease. ions Module using a C18 column (3 m particle, 180 pore, 2.0 mm150 mm, Varian Polaris 5A) with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a 0-to-60% ACN linear gradient in 0.1% aqueous TFA at 1% per minute. natural (human neutrophil-derived) HNP1 was used as standard. plasmid PEC2081 encodes proHNP1 with a 41 amino acid residue N-terminal sequence containing the His6-tag. plasmid was ligated into pET28a+ vector to generate plasmid PEC2129. plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)(codon+), generating strain PEC2132-1. eluted with 3.5 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 450 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) the eluate was dialyzed in Spectrapor 3 membrane against 2 L of dialysis buffer (4 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0), overnight at 4\u00b0C. a 0.8 l sample was mixed 11 with sample matrix (15% w/v -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% ACN+0.1% TFA), spotted and dried on the MALDI-TOF MS sample plate. the reaction mixtures were sparged with N2 and incubated for 18 h in the dark at room temperature. Fractions containing HNP1 were purified further by C18 RP-HPLC. enzymatic treatment of proHNP1 human NE, PR3 and CG were purchased from Elastin Products Company. HPLC HNP1 preparations derived by enzymatic or CNBr treatment were analyzed on an Alliance 2690 Separations Module using a C18 column (3 m particle, 180 pore, 2.0 mm150 mm, Varian Polaris 5A) with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a 0-to-60% ACN linear gradient in 0.1% aqueous TFA at 1% per minute. s and coomassie stained gels of His6-proHNP1A and His6-proHNP1B analyzed A) without additional treatment, B) after 4 h incubation in TUN buffer alone, and C) after 4 h incubation in TUN buffer supplemented with reduced and oxidized glutathione. treatment of proHNP1B with glutathione generated a new species. proHNP1A and proHNP1B are folded and misfolded forms of His6-proHNP1respectively. proHNP1B can be folded in the presence of reduced/oxidized glutathione."}
