{"summary": "multiplex PCR panels are highly sensitive and specific, allowing clinicians to identify likely causal organisms in patients with symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection (1, 2). the impact of multiplex respiratory panels used in hospitalized adults has been mixed, with either minimal (3, 4) or no improvement in reducing antibiotic use (5\u201311) the ePlex RP [RPP] was subsequently instituted (27) and performed as specimens were received during all shifts. this was a retrospective study conducted at two acute large tertiary care teaching hospitals within the same academic and health care system in Rhode Island. the RPP has 100% concordance with laboratory developed testing. multiplex viral testing is recommended for inpatients or those likely to be admitted. rapid influenza A/B PCR testing is recommended for outpatients or those likely to be discharged from the emergency department. secondary outcomes included inpatient admissions, length of stay (LOS), death during hospitalization, allergic reactions, readmission within 30 days. data extracted from electronic medical records included choice, duration, and administration time of antibiotics. imaging was labeled normal if the interpretation indicated no acute pulmonary process. linear model for binary outcomes was used to analyze and estimate proportion of patients who received antibiotics by respiratory testing (RPP and RVP) and chest imaging results (normal/abnormal) an interaction term was included in the model to allow for differences by level of chest imaging result (normal/abnormal) a negative binomial distribution was used to model days of antibiotics by viral test and antibiotic days, with the chest imaging result. the previously instituted RVP (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) detected influenza A virus (H1, H3, and H5), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A, RSV B, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), parainfluenza virus (types 1 to 4), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and adenovirus (28). the sensitivity and specificity were PCR testing (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is recommended for outpatients or those likely to be discharged from the emergency department. the results are immediately released upon assay completion in the electronic medical record. imaging was labeled normal if the interpretation indicated no acute pulmonary process (e.g., clear lung fields, no acute cardiopulmonary process, or chronic emphysematous changes without superimposed airspace disease) radiation interpretations indicating an acute pulmonary process were considered \u201cabnormal\u201d. RESULTS In all, 461 and 1,043 patients who had RVP and RPP testing, respectively, were identified and screened for study inclusion. the mean age in the RVP group was 70.5 years (95% CI, 67.1 to 74.0 years; age distribution, 18 to 40 years; n = 10 [9.2%]; 41 to 60 years, n = 16 [14.6%] and >60 years, n = 84 [76%] the average TATs for positive RVP and RPP results were 27.9 h (95% CI, 24.4 to 31.9 h) and 3.0 h (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2 h), respectively (P 0.0001) patients who tested positive using the RVP were more likely to be in an ICU compared to the RPP-positive group. a smaller proportion of patients with positive RVP testing had asthma (12.7 and 23.1%, respectively; P = 0. 027) pathogens detected Pathogena No. (%) of subjects RVP RPP Adenovirus 0 (0) 6 (2.6) Coronavirus 19 (17.3) 18 (7.7) Influenza A virus 26 (23.6) 81 (34.6) Influenza B virus 0 (0) 13 (5.6) Human metapneumovirus 7 (6.4) 16 (6.8) Entero/rhinovirus 35 (31.8) 61 (26.0) Parainfluenza virus 16 (14.6) 11 (4.7) RSV 14 (12 model estimates for proportions of admitted patients initiated on antibiotics based on positive RVP or RPP results. bars represent 95% confidence intervals. for patients with normal imaging, the proportion that received antibiotics before their test resulted in the EMR was lower in the RPP-positive group than in the RVP-positive group. four patients positive for atypical bacteria (three with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and one with Chlamydophila pneumoniae) with the RPP received appropriate coverage, followed by the weighted proportion of antibiotic daysa Antibiotic treatment RVP (n = 93) RPP (n = 156) No. of subjects Exposed (%) Weighted (%) No. of subjects Exposed (%) Weighted (%) Penicillins Piperacillin-tazobactam 34 36.6 18.0 40 25.6 positive testing were less frequently admitted from the ED in the RPP group compared to the RVP group (76.9% [95% CI, 72.4 to 80.9] and 88.6% [95% CI, 82.6 to 92.7] respectively. for patients initiated on antibiotics, a decrease was seen in LOS between RVP-positive and RPP-positive groups. ance 12/110 10.9 (6.3\u201318.3) 35/234 15.0 (10.9\u201320.1) 0.311 In-hospital death 4/110 3.6 (1.4\u20139.3) 4/234 1.7 (0.6\u20134.5) 0.281 C. difficile infection 0/110 NA 0/234 NA Appropriate oseltamivir is defined as the use of oseltamivir in patients testing positive for influenza A or B. the proportion that received antibiotics before their test resulted in the EMR was lower in the RPP-positive group than in the RVP-positive group. for patients with abnormal chest imaging, the proportion that received antibiotics before their test resulted in the EMR was lower in the RPP-positive group. antibiotic treatment RVP (n = 93) RPP (n = 156) No. of subjects Exposed (%) Weighted (%) No. of subjects Exposed (%) Weighted (%) Penicillins Piperacillin-tazobactam 34 36.6 18.0 40 25.6 15.0 Ampicillin-sulbactam* 7 7.5 2.9 12 7.7 5.1 Cephalosporins Ceftriaxone 41 44.1 14.6 47 30.1 13.8 Cefep 88.5% in the RVP group and 90.3% in the RPP group received oseltamivir (P = 0.78) there were no significant differences in positive C. difficile testing, 30-day hospital readmission, or death during hospitalization. c Appropriate oseltamivir is defined as the use of oseltamivir in patients testing positive for influenza A or B. most clinical impact studies of respiratory multiplex PCR assays with positive outcomes have been in pediatric patients (35\u201337) or have focused on influenza testing with results available in 3 h. a consistent rapid result from a multiplex assay may allow for coordinated decision-making by the provider with other available clinical data. the study builds on previous findings that chest imaging is a strong predictor of antibiotic administration, even though radiography does not reliably distinguish between bacterial and viral infections (13). antibiotic therapy is less immediately clear (41), since a confirmed viral pathogen may be insufficient evidence for providers to withhold or stop antibiotics. the implementation of biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, as part of a clearly defined diagnostic algorithm, may help determine whether bacterial coinfection is likely. syndromic respiratory testing expedites patient cohorting, optimization of isolation rooms and increased ability to track epidemiologic trends. LOT was defined as discrete days in which antibiotics were received. differences in antibiotic duration at smaller intervals may have gone undetected. only patients with positive tests results admitted to our hospitals were selected for primary analysis. adult population provided results fast enough to be clinically actionable, reducing inpatient admissions. positive test result was associated with reduced initiation of inappropriate antibiotics."}
