{"summary": "study was carried out with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) mobility was quantified using a GPS-data logger registering waypoints at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days. results showed that human mobility in a small urban setting exceeded that considered by local health authority\u2019s administrative limits. nearly half of the human population inhabits areas with DENV transmission. DF is an important public health problem, especially in urban areas. cost of treatment and management during a DF outbreak are a serious burden for health systems. the study area is located in the position 18.50 N, -98.75 W, in the southeast corner of the State of Morelos. the municipality of Axochiapan is considered endemic of dengue, since it registers cases every year. population controls were individuals with a negative serological result for recent DENV infection, randomly selected from the same locality. all controls tested negative for DENV during the same period and using the same validated techniques than cases (IgM or IgG capture ELISA) each pair of in-house participants, a randomly selected population control was then assigned. data were converted into a feature dataset and projected from the geographic coordinate system to a Lambert coordinate system. route to home variable (dhome) was calculated for each extradomestic waypoint. distance, speed, altitude and time differentials were created. i T = l o c a l d a t e i + 1 l o c a l d a t e i + 1 l o c a l d a t e j Where: Xccl1 = (x coordinate from current waypoint), Yccl1 = (y coordinate from current waypoint) and Yccl2 = (y coordinate from current 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with age older than 12 were selected from the cohort \"Peridomestic infection as determinant for Dengue virus transmission\" location of study Axochiapan is the main locality of the Municipality of Axochiapan, in the State of Morelos M\u00e9xico. intradomestic controls were individuals with a negative serological result for recent DENV infection, living in the same household with a case. all controls tested negative for DENV during the same period and using the same validated techniques than cases (IgM or IgG capture ELISA) waypoints in the initial and final days of each individual GPS track were eliminated in order to standardize the period of time to be analyzed starting at 00:00:00 hours on the second day of follow up and ending at 23:59:59 on the last to final day of follow up. p e d i S p e d i 1 A = A l t i t u d e i + 1 A l t i t u d e i T = l o c a l d a t e i + 1 l o c a l d a t e j Where: Xccl1 = (x coordinate from a circular buffer with 50 m radius around each participant\u2019s home limited the first area. a circular buffer with 50 m radius around each participant\u2019s home limited the first area. three additional polygonal buffers were drawn according to the administrative limits for the locality, municipality and state. the final database contains 3,064,887 waypoints from these 125 participants, and all participants were followed by a mean of 15.9 continuous days. as for the number of days of follow-up for each group, no differences were recorded for absolute displacement among the groups. the hourly distribution of waypoints out of the participants\u2019 homes is shown in Fig 4. participants usually left their homes early in the morning and returned by the end of the day. the pattern during weekdays suggests cases leave their homes. s 18.7, p = 0.0428), and more visits in the area out of the municipality (10.4 vs 2.9, p = 0.0282) compared to intradomestic controls. differences were statistically significant. municipality 2.3 (0.0\u201315.4) 14.9 (0.0\u2013138.3) 11.4 (0.0\u201393.1) Out of state 3.2 (0.0\u201318.4) 1.1 (0.0\u20138.8) 3.7 (0.0\u201382.0) Out of state 8.1 (0.0\u2013205.4) 2 (0.0\u201318.3) 2.8 (0.0\u201347.7) # Visits per geographic area Mean (range) All visit sites 68.9 (4\u2013284) 75.4 (0\u2013302) 76.4 (0\u2013285) Out of quartile-range 75.5\u201395.5;

p = 0.023), and age (OR 0.26 IC 95% 0.09\u20130.78, p = 0.017) all three groups recorded waypoints exceeding the locality, municipality and state limits. the most visited areas were identified by dividing the locality in 50 m-radius hexagonal cells. the most visited cells were those located in the locality\u2019s central area. the location of the cells considered as common visit sites for cases is shown in Fig 8B. in total 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) were recruited. our drop-out rate was lower than 1% (1/126) since one participant did not finish the follow-up due to the loss of the assigned GPS logger. the final database contains 3,064,887 waypoints from these 125 participants, and all participants were followed by a mean of 15.9 continuous days. as for the number of days of follow-up for each group no differences were recorded. the pattern during weekdays suggests that cases leave their homes and return to them slightly earlier than control groups. both control groups show a similar pattern to that observed for weekdays. however, cases seem to remain in their homes more often and return earlier.
