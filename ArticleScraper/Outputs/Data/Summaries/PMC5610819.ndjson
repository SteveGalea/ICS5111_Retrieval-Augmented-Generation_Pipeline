{"summary": "shigellosis is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, nonmotile, nonspore forming, and rod-shaped true bacteria closely related to Salmonella and Escherichia coli. it is most commonly associated with diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. in each year, 165 million cases of Shigella are accounted worldwide, of that, 163 million take place in developing countries. ciprofloxacin, a third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been used effectively for the treatment of bacillary dysentery. ciprofloxacin is annotated in the she pathogenicity island of Shigella. SigA is a multifunctional protein, able to degrade casein with cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects. epitope-based immunizing agents are often inexpensive choice to thwart enteric Shigella infection. the invention of a wet laboratory-based candidate epitope is expensive and laborious. the interest for predicting epitopes by computational strategies, alternate in silico approaches among researchers, is growing bit by bit with reduced efforts. vaccinomics approaches have proven its potency in identifying conserved epitopes by targeting protein SigA. SigA protein sequences of different strains of Shigella species were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank [22] database and analysed in the VaxiJen v2.0 [23] server for the determination of the most potent antigenic protein. the stabilized matrix method (SMM) was used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of peptide binding to MHC class I with a preselected 9.0-mer epitope. the peptides were also assessed for HLA I binding affinity by the software, EPISOFT. SPATE family is very specific for the enterobacteria, specifically, E. coli and Shigella. we include two E. coli sequences (gi|693049347| and gi|699401135|) and those of four species of Shigella for MSA construction. the structure of autoimmune TCR Hy.1B11 in complex with HLA-DQ1 was retrieved from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein database [43] was simplified by using PyMOL (the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) for the final docking purpose. the predicted T-cell epitope (15-mer) was screened by IEDB-AR using web-based tools for the suitability as the B-cell epitope. the target protein was crosschecked against human pathogens and other similar pathogens to ensure the orthologous entry. half-maximal inhibitory concentration of peptide binding to MHC class I with a preselected 9.0-mer epitope. the peptides were also assessed for HLA I binding affinity by the software, EPISOFT. we have selected the HLA-E01:01 molecule as a candidate for MHC class I and the HLA-DQA1 as a candidate for MHC class II for docking analysis. we also include two E. coli sequences (gi|693049347| and gi|699401135|) along with those of four species of Shigella for MSA construction. a control docking with the experimentally known peptide\u2014MHC-bound complex. the gridline was used at the center of X: 77.3404, Y: 3.5159, and Z: 9.5829. the predicted T-cell epitope (15-mer) was screened by IEDB-AR using web-based tools for the suitability as the B-cell epitope [47\u201349]. results 3.1. Analysis of the Retrieved Sequences and Their Antigenicity A total of 44 SigA proteins from different variants of S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei were retrieved from the GenBank database. the peptide IELAGTLTLT was predicted to have the highest number of MHC class I binding. the interacted alleles were reassessed by cluster analysis and shown in Figure 2(a) as a heat map.

Figure 6. Population coverage analysis for the top predicted epitope based on the HLA interaction. the 15-mer epitope interacted with Asp-55 through electrostatic interaction and Glu-66 through steric interaction. the control docking energy was found to be 6.8 kcal/mol and is illustrated in Figure S4. the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale was employed for evaluating the antigenic property of the peptide with a maximum of 1.072. Henceforth, Emini surface accessibility prediction was employed with a maximum propensity score of 1.137. we have tried to find alternatives to treat this global burden through vaccinomics approaches and targeting the immunogenic and toxic protein SigA. the sequences of different strains of Shigella showed that there is a little island of conserved sequence throughout the species. the orthologous entry search of our targeted protein revealed no significant similarity with human pathogens and other closely related pathogens. we have used pSORTb to predict the subcellular localization of SigA. we found that there is a score of 5.87 for localization in the outer membrane and 4.13 for extracellular localization. the result was quite similar with that for the localization of other SPATE proteins in the bacterial cell surface as well as in secreted forms. our proposed epitopes are nonallergenic in nature according to the FAO/WHO allergenicity evaluation scheme. the core epitope \u201cIELAGTLTL\u201d was also found to be more potential B-cell epitope candidates that were proposed through the sequence-based approaches including the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale. from the overhead analysis, we envisage that our suggested epitope would also elicit an immune response in vitro.
