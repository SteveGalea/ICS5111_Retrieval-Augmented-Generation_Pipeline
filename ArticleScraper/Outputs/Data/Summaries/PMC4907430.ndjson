{"summary": "movement restriction policies (MRPs) are one of the most popular strategies implemented in and between countries to fight the spread of infectious animal diseases in Europe and worldwide. scale-free networks provide a theoretical basis for designing strategies for controlling infectious diseases in cattle and other livestock. removing infected nodes or immunizing susceptible ones are efficient mechanisms to fight the spread of a disease. a country makes implementation of the MRP more efficient. surveillance protocols must be sufficiently efficient that infections are detected. farmers may be slow to report possible infection, especially when immobilization of their animals can be associated with very large costs. changes in farmers\u2019 behavior can make the policy ineffective under certain conditions. this is due to a mismatch between the time that the MRP is announced in a country (when an infectious disease is detected) and the time that immobilization is implemented in a specific region of that country. this result holds even under the assumption of perfect compliance by farmers (no misbehavior) the distribution of degrees is heavy-tailed with power-law behavior of the form P(k) k with 2 3, where P(k) is the density function evaluated for degree \u201ck\u201d. a fat-tailed degree distribution network is constructed following the characteristics of the French cattle trade network described by Rautureau et al. active farms Min 32,920 13.6% Max 58,605 24.1% Active dealers Min 865 65.8% Max 1,042 79.2% Active markets Min 57 75.0% Max 73 96.1% * This variable represents the number of nodes that have at least one transaction for a specific week. the probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors and can be computed as 1-(1-)N, where N is the number of infectious neighbors. after the infection stage the disease is detected with probability, which is equal to 1 if detection is perfect. the MRP isolates the nodes detected as infected as well as their geographic neighbors. this simulates establishing a protection zone around the perimeter in which no infected animals have been detected. the infection is introduced by infecting one random node in the first period. the spread of the infection is summarized by the number of infected nodes up to 300 time periods. the probability of selling was derived for weekly cattle trade networks. the farmer decides not to sell at t = 1 nor at t = 2. he receives an option value V, which is smaller than the revenue he would receive by selling at t = 2. if animals become too heavy, farmers may face a lower price. this penalty does not represent fluctuations of market prices. q yields q > p * w 1 * d c p * w 1 ( 1 + d ) c. q is the threshold for q above which anticipatory selling is an optimal choice. the node is connected to a node located in the RZ so q i, t > q triggers anticipatory sales (pr = 1). a monetary transfer to farmers in the RZ is a simple mechanism to avoid (or reduce) the anticipatory behavior of farmers at risk of entering the RZ. efficiency of the MRP was quantified by an index defined as the proportional increase in the area above the curve of accumulated infected nodes due to the policy. the index ranges from 0 to infinity, where 0 is associated with a policy with no benefits in terms of slowing the disease spreading. a fat-tailed degree distribution network is constructed following the characteristics of the French cattle trade network described by Rautureau et al. [21] to mimic the French cattle network, the nodes were ranked by degree and the top 0.04% were classified as markets, the next 0.54% as dealers, and the remaining 99.42% as farms. each group (farms, dealers, and markets) is characterized by a probability of selling derived from the French cattle network. the probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors. the probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors and can be computed as 1-(1-)N, where N is the number of infectious neighbors. the control stage takes place in which movement-restriction policies are implemented in two steps: first, the Id-nodes are isolated with probability; second, direct neighbors at the geographic network of infected and controlled nodes are isolated. the MRP isolates the nodes detected as infected as well as their geographic neighbors. this simulates establishing a protection zone around the infected perimeter in which no infected animals have been detected but movements are restricted. the probability of selling was derived for weekly cattle trade networks. 300 simulations were performed using Matlab (MathWorks) a time period can be interpreted as a week in this analysis. if animals become too heavy/old, farmers may face a lower price. this penalty does not represent fluctuations of market prices. but the fact that if a farmer does not sell at the right moment, the animal losses some characteristics valued by buyers. q p * w 1 * d c p * w 1 ( 1 + d ) V as the threshold for q above which anticipatory selling is an optimal choice. anticipatory sales affect the rewiring process, which modifies the spread of the disease. monetary transfer to farmers in the RZ is a simple mechanism to avoid (or reduce) the anticipatory behavior of farmers at risk of entering the RZ. the size of the monetary transfer (denoted by T) that makes farmers with probability qit of entering the RZ in the next period indifferent between anticipating and waiting can be derived from: p * w 1 = q i t * ( V c + T ) + ( 1 q i t ) the index ranges from 0 to infinity, where 0 is associated with a policy with no benefits in terms of slowing the disease spreading. a rank-correlation analysis was performed to explore how characteristics and location of the initial case of infection contribute to variability in the results. the correlations explored are between the accumulated number of infected nodes at a specific time period. a disease with a 5% infection rate infects half of the nodes around periods 275, 185, and 125 for detection rates equal to 100%, 50%, and 20%. a disease with a low detection rate, = 20%, the benefits of the MRP are severely reduced. rank correlation coefficients are small and positive for the degree and closeness of the initial infected node. large and negative for the time at which the first hub is infected. the size of the monetary transfer required to prevent anticipatory selling is derived for two option values that correspond to different penalties (10% and 30%) on the value of the animal. factors that limit the speed of detecting infections are an obstacle for implementation of the MRP. the MRP becomes significantly less efficient when infected nodes spread the disease through both trade and geographic networks. the detection period can also be lengthened by the absence of active surveillance activities or lack of declaration in cases of clinical suspicion. the fat-tailed degree distribution of the cattle trade network plays an important role in accelerating the rate of disease spreading. anticipatory sales can infect hubs, which can quickly infect other nodes. if the trade network were homogenous, hubs would not exist and the effect of anticipatory sales on the spread of diseases would be smaller. a monetary transfer conditional on entering the RZ is proposed as a simple mechanism to avoid the change in behavior of farmers affected by the policy. this monetary transfer must be credible and announced in advance so that farmers know of it when considering anticipatory selling. the monetary transfer must be credible and announced in advance so that farmers know of it when considering anticipatory selling. the monetary transfer to farmers located in the RZ reduces the costs associated with being immobilized. the size of the monetary transfer for risk-neutral farmers is given by Eq (6). the first element of the monetary transfer represents the gain from selling prematurely adjusted by the risk of falling into the RZ compared with waiting and being unable to sell. additional measures that help in the control of infectious diseases can be classified in three categories: measures oriented to reduce the transmission rate such as vaccination or the use of insecticides in the case of vector-borne diseases. the third type of measure is possible only with the collection of accurate data and the construction of reliable models. the strategic behavior of agents can be an important element to consider when analyzing the efficiency of control strategies. the MRP produces incentives that may yield behavioral responses that reduce its effectiveness. the inclusion of complementary measures in emergency protocols can increase the efficacy of these policies. average results over 300 simulations with infection rate = 5%, detection rate = 20%, and control rate = 100%. monetary transfer required to avoid anticipatory sales by farmers is a function of the subjective probability of being in the RZ in the next period (q)"}
