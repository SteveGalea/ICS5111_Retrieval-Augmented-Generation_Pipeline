{"summary": "feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and feline caliciviruses (FCVs) are important pathogens of cats. they cause mild, self-limiting localized infection in the intestinal tract or oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. but these viruses can also cause a life-threatening systemic illness with a high fatality rate in cats. FCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. the virus is a member of the Coronaviridae family. it produces one (calicivirus) or multiple (coronavirus) viral polyproteins. the efficacies of representative dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compounds were evaluated in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus (MHV). the synthesis of dipeptidyl compounds GC373, GC376, GC543, GC546, GC551, and GC554 (22, 24, 25) and tripeptidyl compounds NPI52 (compound 2) showed minimal antiviral activity against FCV in cell culture. pound 6), NPI64 (compound 7), and NPI71 (compound 8) (23) were synthesized by modification of a previously reported method. the structures of the compounds are shown in Fig. 1A and B. CRFK cells and WSU-79-1146 were obtained from ATCC. the FCVs were kind gifts from J. Parker at Cornell University. RFK cells were immediately infected with FCoV WSU-79-1146 or FCV Urbana at an MOI of 2. at 12 h postinfection, cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% -mercaptoethanol. proteins were resolved on 10% Novex Tris-bis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. MHV A59 was performed using the ClustalW multiple-sequence-alignment program. the three-dimensional structure of FCoV 3CLpro was built by using the EasyModeller program (29) and the 3CLpro structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus (Protein Data Bank accession number 2AMP) as the templates. mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV A59 at 7.2 104 or 5.2 105 TCID50/mouse. the livers were collected and processed for virus titration. titers were determined by the TCID50 method. the mean total score per sample and the mean number of lesions per sample were compared among the different experimental groups using two-tailed Student's t test. the 3CLpro inhibitor libraries generated by our group were evaluated. CRFK cells and WSU-79-1146 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) the FCVs were kind gifts from J. Parker at Cornell University. CRFK cells in 96-well plates were incubated with each compound at various concentrations up to 150 M for 24 h. cell cytotoxicity measured by using a CytoTox96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) FCoV strains WSU-79-1146, Black, and DF-2 are FIP-causing FCoVs. the three-dimensional structure of FCoV 3CLpro was built by using the EasyModeller program (29) and the 3CLpro structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus (Protein Data Bank accession number 2AMP) as the templates. the EC50 of GC376 and NPI52 against MHV A59 were determined to be 0.2 to 1 M in CCL9.1 mouse liver cells. we inoculated 4- to 5-week-old female mice intraperitoneally with MHV A59 at 7.2 104 or 5.2 105 TCID50/mouse. at 2 and 4 days postinfection, the mice were sacrificed. five views were examined per mouse liver, and a score of from 0 to 5 was assigned to each lesion contained in the view. each score in each sample was added to give a final total score. the mean number of lesions per sample was also calculated for each group. NPI52 exhibited potent anti-FCoV and anti-FCV activity. the presence of the additional residue at the P3 subsite dramatically increased its activity against FCV. replacement of aldehyde with -hydroxy phosphonate greatly decreased the anti-FCV activity. new tab Western blot analysis of effects of compounds on expression of FCoV nucleocapsid protein or FCV VP1 in CRFK cells. cells were mock treated or treated with each compound and immediately infected with FCoV 79-1146 or FCV Urbana. MHV A59 3CLpro shares an amino acid sequence homology of 47.35% with FCoV 3CLpro. the locations of the catalytic residues correspond well to those of FCoV strains. the residues in the catalytic triad are shown in the blue boxes. in vivo efficacy of compounds in coronavirus-infected mice. intraperitoneal inoculation of MHV A59 at 5.2 105 (A) or 5.2 105 TCID50 per mouse led to high levels of virus replication in the liver. levels of virus replication were not significantly different between the two virus inocula. PI52 divided into two doses per day starting at 4 h prior to virus infection. titers are expressed as log10 TCID50 per gram of liver tissue. asterisks indicate significant differences between control and treated groups. the group treated with NPI52 at 100 mg/kg had a significantly lower mean total histopathology scores per mouse liver than the controls. there was no statistically significant difference in the mean total histopathology scores and the mean number of lesions between the control group and the group treated with NPI52 at 10 mg/kg. however, the lesions in all drug-treated groups were scored 3 or lower, which is in contrast to the presence of lesions scored 4 or 5 in the no-treatment control group whiskers represent the 5% and 95% confidence intervals. the lines in the middle represent the medians for the data. antiviral effects of dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compounds on the replication of FCoV and FCV. in NPI52 with ketoamides [(C=O)NHCH(CH3)2 or (C=O)NHC(CH3)3] greatly decreased the anti-FCV activity. but the activity of these compounds against FCoV was only moderately decreased. CC50 values of all compounds range from 21.96 M to greater than 150 M in CRFK cells. EC50 of NPI52 against non-vs-FCV or vs-FCV strains Virus and strain EC50 (M) vs-FCV Jengo 0.03 0.01 5 0.35 0.27 Ari 0.10 0.09 Deuce 0.22 0.002 non-vs-FCV 131 0.03 0.03 F9 0.05 0.05 Urbana 0.02 0.01 Multiple-sequence alignment and three-dimensional structural models for 3CLpro. three-dimensional structural models for FCV 3CLpro (B) and FCoV 3CLpro (D) are indicated by red arrowheads (C) the catalytic residues E60, C122, and H39 of FCoV 3CLpro (A) and H41 and C144 of FCoV 3CLpro and MHV A59 3CLpro are indicated by red arrowheads (C) the fold reductions of the geometric mean virus titers in mice treated with GC376 at 50 or 100 mg/kg at 4 days p.i. were 9.86 and 21.99, respectively, compared to the titers in the control mice. contrast, GC376 at 10 mg/kg did not consistently lead to a significant reduction in virus titers at the two time points. treatment with NPI52 at 100 mg/kg resulted in significant reduction in liver virus titers at 4 days p.i. (fold reductions, 19.63 to 40.27) and at 2 days p.i. (fold reductions, 3.46 to 12.3) compared to titers in the controls. mock-infected mice did not show any signs of illness during the experiments. lesion, and the data for that liver section were excluded from the statistical analysis for Fig. 5B to D. panels 0 through 5 show microscopic lesions for increasing histopathology severity scores of 0 through 5 respectively. scores 0, minimal change; scores 1 and 2, multifocal areas of necrosis; and scores 3 to 5, coalescing areas of necrosis. peptidyl compounds have EC50 against many members of the caliciviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses, including FCoV. these compounds were only minimally effective against FCV in cell culture (EC50, >30 M) and their low level of activity was speculated to be due to space constraints in the S2 pocket in the 3CLpro of FCV. the effects of different warheads on the tripeptidyl compound were more profound on the antiviral activity against FCoV than that against FCoV. the interactions of the warhead and the nucleophile Cys in the active site of FCoV 3CLpro may require a fit more stringent than that in the active site of FCoV. s-FCV strains and non-vs-FCV strains in cell culture to determine sensitivity of various strains of FCV to the compound. higher EC50 of NPI52 against vs-FCV may be attributed to faster multicycle growth kinetics of vs-FCV strains leading to yield of virus progeny higher than those for non-vs-FCV strains. a dipeptidyl compound (GC376) and a tripeptidyl compound (NPI52) were evaluated in mice infected with a murine coronavirus, MHV. MHV causes systemic diseases, including hepatitis and a variety of immunological dysfunctions, in mice. this animal model was used as a surrogate for FIP. a lesion score of 4 or greater indicates that NPI52 treatment at both doses inhibited the expansion of the lesions in the liver. inhibition of coronavirus 3CLpro is a valid therapeutic approach to suppress coronavirus replication and virus-induced pathology."}
