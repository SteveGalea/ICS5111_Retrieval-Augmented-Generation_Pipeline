{"summary": "canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) are closely related viruses that have been included in the unique species Feline panleukopenia virus together with other antigenic and genetically related viruses. raccoon parvovirus (RPV), raccoon dog parvovirus (RDPV), blue fox parvovirus (BFPV) and mink enteritis virus (MEV) all together, these viruses infect a wide range the pathogenicity of the disease caused by feline-like parvoviruses is still unclear. reports refer mainly to serological or virological evidences rather than clinical or anatomo-histological data. only red foxes, stone marten, badger, common genet and, more recently, the Egyptian mongoose have a known generalized distribution. wild carnivore species free-ranging in mainland Portugal. virological survey performed on 34 specimens from the herpestidae, canidae and Mustelidae families of the order Carnivora. da Parvovirusb PVc CoVc CDVc CAV1/CAV2c InfluenzaAc Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) 19 R, H 15/19 (78.9%) 4/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 negative for CDV, CAV1, CAV2, ADV, Influenza A and FHV. only PV was evaluated on a broader sample. parvovirus vp2 sequences (93 bp) were detected by real-time PCR in lymph node and intestine samples. parvovirus DNA amplification curves obtained during real-time PCR assays with tissue samples from wild carnivores. the relative fluorescence units (RFU) are plotted against cycle number. the average Ct was 34.73 cycles (standard deviation of 3.36) values above 40 were considered negative. the mesenteric lymph node and/or intestine of PV-positive specimens were under significant autolysis. 90% of mongoose\u2019s and 74% of red foxes\u2019 tissues were under significant autolysis. a modified ELISA methodology detected CPV/FPLV antibodies. amplification of the complete vp2 gene (2 kb-long) proved difficult. only partial nucleotide sequences of the vp2 gene were obtained from tissues of two mongooses. FPLV, on the top line, is represented by the vp2 sequence from a lion isolate. sequences 41219-1, 41219-2 and 41219-3 refer to red fox specimens. other virus types are represented by strains M23255 (CPV-2), DQ340410 (CPV-2a), AB054222 (newCPV-2a-Asp300), AF306450 (CPV-2b), AB054221 (newCPV-2b-Asp300), AF306449 (CPV2b-Pro265) and FJ vp2 sequence from mongoose 22124-7 (JF422105) and partial vp2 sequence from mongoose 41220-1 showed all characteristic FPLV amino acid residues [2], indicating both are FPLV-like viruses. the comparison of the disclosed nucleotide regions within vp2 from mongoose and red fox sequences showed that the degree of genetic similarity is very high. vp2 sequences with sequences available in GenBank showed similarity with parvoviruses from captive Felidae and domestic cats from Portugal. FPLV strains from Italy were found preserved in the stone marten parvovirus. CPV-characteristic residues at positions Arg-80, Ser-564 and Gly-568 revealed that the stone marten strain is a newCPV-2b virus type. a phylogenetic tree was obtained with a Bayesian inference of phylogeny throughout the MrBayes v3.1.2 software. the analysis was performed with ngen = 106, nchains = 4 and samplefreq = 10. the mongoose isolate clustered with two FPLV strains from a tiger and a lion obtained during an outbreak that occurred in 2006 at the Lisbon Zoo, Portugal. the AUC value, derived from the ROC curve reached 0.609 (sd = 0.057), revealing a low accuracy according to criteria defined elsewhere. the detection of parvovirus in mongooses cannot be predicted by influence of any of the independent variables tested (age class, body condition or corpses origin) parvovirus DNA was detected in 19 animals, specifically mongoose (n = 14 out of 28, 50%), red fox (n = 4) and stone marten (n = 1). only one mongoose, which was also exposed to PV, tested positive for CoV. parvovirus vp2 sequences (93 bp) were detected by real-time PCR in lymph node and intestine samples of 81 out of 128 specimens. the average Ct was 34.73 cycles. negative controls had no measurable fluorescence indicated by a flat line in the plot. the average Ct was 34.73 cycles (standard deviation of 3.36) values above 40 were considered negative. negative controls had no measurable fluorescence indicated by flat lines in the plot. the high incidence of PV DNA in sampled specimens (63.3%) suggests that mesocarnivore species are highly exposed to PV infection in Portugal. the mesenteric lymph node and/or intestine of PV-positive specimens were under significant autolysis. 90% of mongoose\u2019s and 74% of red foxes\u2019 tissues were under significant autolysis. a modified commercial indirect ELISA methodology detected CPV/FPLV antibodies among all species. only partial nucleotide sequences of the vp2 gene were obtained from tissues of two mongooses and four red foxes. FPLV is represented by the vp2 sequence from a lion isolate (EF418569) nucleotides which are identical to those in FPLV are represented by dots. the position of nucleotides within vp2 is indicated above FPLV reference sequence. complete vp2 sequence from mongoose 22124-7 (JF422105) and partial vp2 sequence from mongoose 41220-1 showed all characteristic FPLV amino acid residues. amino acids found at positions 426, 564 and 568 indicate that this strain is also a FPLV\u2013like virus. ten specimens were found preserved in the stone marten parvovirus. amino acids occupying positions 93 (Asn), 103 (Ala) and 323 (Asn) that are critical for the ability of CPV to replicate in dogs were found preserved in the stone marten strain. the analysis was performed with ngen = 106, nchains = 4 and samplefreq = 10. the numbers included on each boot strap represent the Bayesian posterior probability. the mongoose isolate clustered with two FPLV strains from a tiger and a lion obtained during an outbreak that occurred in 2006. parvoviruses are considered endemic in most domestic and feral carnivore populations worldwide [1],[2]. the incidence rates detected during this study in widely distributed wild carnivore species are consistent with this notion. CPV/FPLV antibodies have been reported in red foxes, stone martens and genets. a total of 26 (90%) out of 29 LTEs from DNA-positive animals were serologically reactive. this is the first report on the detection of parvovirus antibodies in badgers. a phylogenetic analysis showed a close genetic similarity between the stone marten vp2 sequence and a newCPV-2b domestic dog strain from USA. it is likely that the stone marten virus may have been originated in infected domestic species, and do not represent an evolutionary intermediate in the CPV-2b branch. a marked immune response was apparently developed after infection with FPLV but no clinical signs were detected with MEV and CPV-2 inoculation [30]. no virological reports dedicated to the study of the susceptibility of herpestids, particularly the Egyptian mongoose, to parvovirus infection have been reported. the lack of knowledge on the susceptibility, pathogenicity and morbidity of the FPLV/CPV infection in many wild species hampers the true understanding of the dynamics of this disease in wild populations. some studies have evaluated the factors influencing the seroprevalence of viral agents in wildlife and showed a clear influence of age on the exposure risk [39]. animals from the herpestidae, canidae, Mustelidae, and Viverridae families of the order Carnivora were analyzed in this study. samples, collected from 2008 to 2011, included animals from road-kills (n = 26, all surveyed species) and animals captured under legal game management actions aiming the control of predator densities. animal carcasses were preserved in sealed plastic bags, refrigerated into a collection center and kept frozen until necropsy. animals were sampled from 15 out of 18 administrative regions (districts) of mainland Portugal, the westernmost country of the Eurasian supercontinent. Detection of Viral Pathogens The presence of Parvovirus (PV), Coronavirus (CoV), Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), Feline Herpesvirus (FHV), Canine Adenovirus types 1 and 2 (CAV 1 and CAV2) and Influenza virus (IV) was preliminarily investigated in wild carnivores for a subset of animal specimens.

LTEs of seven mongooses and three red foxes that were negative in real-time PCR were selected as putative antibody negative samples. the results confirm the successful use of protein A-HRPO in ELISA to detect mongoose IgGs. protein-A conjugate has also been used in other studies to detect fox IgGs. ELISA using protein A affinity conjugate was slightly less sensitive for measuring anti-parvovirus antibodies in foxes than the equivalent commercial ELISA. in the case of the antibody positive red fox LTE, ratios of 0.304 and 0.429 were obtained with the modified and commercial ELISA test. phylogenetic tree was obtained with a Bayesian inference of phylogeny. vp2 sequences from one mongoose (Herpestidae) and one stone marten (Mustelidae) were compared with the vp2 sequences from several wild carnivore parvoviruses. the influence of gender, age class (juvenile, subadult, and adult) on parvovirus positivity (detection/non-detection) was tested by using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) with a binomial distribution and a logit link function. the residuals from ordinary least squares regression of body mass on total length were used as indices of body condition. animals from the herpestidae, canidae, Mustelidae, and Viverridae families of the order Carnivora were collected from 2008 to 2011. none of the authors were responsible for the death of any animals nor were any samples used in the study. animal carcasses were preserved in sealed plastic bags, refrigerated into a collection center and kept frozen until necropsy. animals were sampled from 15 out of 18 administrative regions (districts) of mainland Portugal. age was not available for six animals while sex was not recorded for 14 specimens. small intestine and mesenteric lymph node were collected from each animal during necropsy. no gross lesions were apparent at autopsy, even though histopathological examinations evidenced autolysis.

ISA PA\u2013HRPO test results showed that the ELISA using protein A affinity conjugate was slightly less sensitive for measuring anti-parvovirus antibodies in foxes than the equivalent commercial ELISA. results showed that the ELISA using protein A affinity conjugate was slightly less sensitive for measuring anti-parvovirus antibodies in foxes. PCR products were excised and purified by a commercial kit. the resulting products were directly sequenced using a 3130 Genetic Analyser. the polypeptide sequences were deduced in order to determine and differentiate the type of virus present. analysis was run for 106 generations (ngen = 106) with four chains of temperature (nchains = 4) each chain was sampled every 10th generations. influence of gender, age class (juvenile, subadult, and adult) and morphometry (body total length, tail length, body mass and body condition) on parvovirus positivity (detection/non-detection) was tested. the Akaike weights (wi) were calculated to obtain each model\u2019s probability of being the best model for the data. all modelling analyses were performed using R software, version 2.10.0 (R Development Core Team 2008), together with the \u201cape - Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution\u201d [66] and the MuMIn [67] packages."}
