{"summary": "human infection with MERS-CoV was first observed in jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in september 2012 in patients with severe pneumonia. the first hospital outbreak was then reported in a public hospital in al Zarqa, Jordan, and involved 8 healthcare workers. as of 10 March 2017, 1,979 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO with 684 mortalities in 27 countries. he had no other significant symptoms, risk factors, or exposures prior to admission. his initial chest X-ray on admission was unremarkable. he underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery with no complications. three specimens, including a nasopharyngeal swab, deep endotracheal aspirate, and serum sample, were collected and tested using the MERS rRT-PCR assay. on 12 April, he was transferred to a hospital in dammam, Saudi Arabia. later that day, he passed away. investigation included detailed information on type of contact with the patient, protection used during the contact, and procedures done for the patient during hospitalization. the infection control team followed all contacts for a period of 14 days for any clinical symptoms. no postexposure cases were identified after thorough contact tracing and surveillance. MERS-CoV is thought to be a zoonotic virus with transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. the origin of the virus seems to be the Arabian Peninsula since most of the clusters and outbreaks are reported within the same area. in one study on 63 patients in the ICU, MERS-CoV was only detected in 20.7% of the first nasopharyngeal samples and 76.5% of the first deep tracheal aspirate samples [13]. in our patient, the first nasopharyngeal swab was negative; at that time, he was asymptomatic; a second sample was collected after he deteriorated; this sample was an endotrac no serology tests were performed on camels or humans in Bahrain. we cannot confirm whether there were undetected cases. authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}
