{"summary": "palatine tonsils, pharyngeal tonsil, lingual tonsils and tubal tonsils are known to play a key role in the human host defense. these structures harbour numerous different types of tissues, including epithelium, lymphoid follicles, blood vessels and connective tissues 3,4. the combination of these different tissues as well as their anatomic arrangement in crypts facilitates optimised exposure and processing of antigens. in-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted) promote the attraction of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils 17. the presented work investigated the importance of different chemokines in tonsillar inflammatory disease and tonsil hyperplasia. mortar, 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent (Gibco, Ingolstadt, Germany) was applied upon 200 mg of tissue. samples of total RNA were adjusted to 1.0 g for first strand cDNA synthesis. RNA was heat-denatured (65\u00b0C, 10 min), chilled on ice. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Reverse transcribed cDNA products (0.2 5l) were incubated in 50 l reaction mixture containing 0.2 M 5\u2019-3\u2019 sequence specific sense oligonucleotide primers. 0.2 M of 3\u2019-5\u2019 corresponding antisense oligonucleotide primers, 200 M dNTP\u2019s, 1.5 mM MgCl2. the reaction mixture was covered with a mineral oil layer to prevent evaporation. PCR parameters were modified to a 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 60 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. after PCR, all samples were subjected to ethidium-bromide stained 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. a p-value 0.05 was considered significant, and a p-value 0.01 was considered highly significant. 89 patients underwent surgery for hyperplasia of either the palatine or pharyngeal tonsil or chronic inflammation of the palatine tonsil. RNA was heat-denatured (65\u00b0C, 10 min), chilled on ice, and subjected to random hexanucleotide primed reverse transcription. resulting RNA-cDNA double-stranded helix was heat-denatured (95\u00b0C, 5 min) to provide cDNA as a template for polymerisation. cDNA products were incubated in 50 l reaction mixture containing 0.2 M 5\u2019-3\u2019 sequence specific sense oligonucleotide primers. the reaction mixture was covered with a mineral oil layer to prevent evaporation. high stringency PCR was run for 34 cycles (94\u00b0C for 75 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min) the PCR parameters were modified to a 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 60 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. RANTES and RANTES total-mRNA expression showed a median of 1.37 for tonsil hyperplasia (n = 21), adenoids (n = 25), chronic tonsillitis (n = 16) and chronic tonsillitis (n = 27) a significant overexpression of eotaxin-2 was observed in adenoids compared to patients with chronic tonsillitis (p 0.05). a total of 89 tissue samples were analysed. IL-8 was significantly overexpressed in patients with chronic inflammatory tonsillar disease compared to tonsil hyperplasia. RANTES and Eotaxin Relative RANTES total-mRNA expression showed a median of 1.37 for tonsil hyperplasia 1.58 for adenoids, 1.32 for chronic tonsillitis and 1.56 for acute tonsillitis. eotaxin-2 was 1.02 in tonsillar hyperplasia, 1.34 for adenoids, 1.16 for chronic tonsillitis and 1.16 for acute tonsillitis. a total of 89 tissue samples were analysed. Tonsillar hyperplasia (n = 21) Adenoids (n = 25) Chronic tonsillitis (n = 16) Acute tonsillitis (n = 27) Minimum 0,41 0.00 0.54 0.00. median values were 0.84 for tonsillar hyperplasia, 1.07 for adenoids, 0.60 for chronic tonsillitis and 0.55 for acute tonsillits. total RNA expression was correlated to the expression of the housekeeping gene G3PDH in each sample. chemokines are small signalling proteins, whose expression in various tissues is variably regulated during immune responses as well as acute and chronic infection. previous studies have suggested a functional role for chemokines in hepatitis, colitis, pancreatitis, asthma and various malignancies. tonsil size has been shown to be directly proportional to the mean bacterial load 30. haemophilus infection appears to be more common in tonsillar hyperplasia 30. eotaxin, eotaxin-2 und eotaxin-3 are CC-chemokines. RANTES is a selective attractant for T-cell and monocytes migration 35. a combination of TNF- and INF-c strongly stimulate production of RANTES 36. eotaxin-2 and RANTES are constitutively expressed in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. however, it is remarkable that eotaxin-2 as well as RANTES are constitutively expressed in the gastrointestinal tract."}
