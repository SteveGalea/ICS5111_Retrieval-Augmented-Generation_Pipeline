{"summary": "the pandemic virus came from a reassortment event in swine rather than birds. it appeared to have a mild severity profile similar to seasonal influenza. the pandemic emerged in north America. most attention had been focused on the risk of a novel virus emerging in southeast Asia. the first wave of pH1N1 in Hong Kong compared to the weekly number of hospitalizations of confirmed cases during the first wave, April\u2013December 2009. this article aimed to identify key elements of the successful realtime research response. 'Title/Abstract' or \u2018Affiliation\u2019 to identify studies on pH1N1 in Hong Kong. also limited the search to articles published after the WHO issued the first alert on the novel H1N1 virus (April 24, 2009) the search to articles published after the WHO issued the first alert on the novel H1N1 virus (April 24, 2009) included papers that were published within 3 years of the identification of pH1N1. other relevant studies identified by the authors were manually retrieved. the excess mortality rates associated with pH1N1 were highest in the elderly JT Wu (7) Apr\u2013Dec 2009 Transmission and severity Serum specimens. more transmission occurred among children BJ Cowling (10) May\u2013Nov 2009 Transmission All laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 infections in Hong Kong Ecological study The effective reproduction number declined from 14\u201315 at the start of the local epidemic to 11\u201312 later in the summer in 2009 AJX Zhang (11) May 2009\u2013Feb 2010 Transmission and severity Serum specimen in 51\u201360 years of age group had highest incidence of infection and incidence rate of severe disease B Klick (12) Apr\u2013Oct 2009 Household transmission Paired sera from members of 117 households Cohort study Risk of secondary infections in household contacts was similar for pandemic and seasonal influenza YH Leung (13) Jun 2009 Household transmission Exposed students: 511 Infected students: 65 Household contacts: 205 Observational study The risk of secondary infections wasestimated to be 59% through a contact investigation 770 Cohort study Around half of schoolage children were infected during the first wave of pH1N1. older adults had higher risk of ICU admission and death, compared with schoolage children JFW Chan (20) may 2009\u2013Jan 2010 Risk factors of severe cases Severe cases: 38 Mild cases: 36 Case\u2013control study It could not be determined whether IgG2 deficiency was a risk factor for severe pH1N1 infection N Lee (21) Jun 2009\u2013May 2010 Severity patients with severe clinical presentations generally had stronger and higher humoral antibody responses than milder cases T Lei (27) Serologic study Crosssectional: Vaccinated healthy individuals: 23 postinfection sera Postvaccination GBS patients: 8 sera Animal experiment: 6 mice Crosssectional study and animal challenge experiment Vaccination against 2009 H1N1 virus was unlikely associated with the production of antiganglioside antibodies implicated in the pathogenesis of GBS. crosssectional study Young adults (20\u201329 years) had the lowest risk 039% of hospitalization if infected with pH1N1. children aged 5\u201314 had the highest risk of hospital admission (08%) AJX Zhang (11) may 2009\u2013Feb 2010 Clinical impact Serum sample: Baseline: 795 Pandemic: 1000 Laboratoryconfirmed cases. a lack of changes in preventive measures and knowledge about the disease in the general population. a number of factors were associated with the maintenance of preventive behaviors JTF Lau (33) May\u2013Jun 2009 Behavioral responses Respondents: 999 Crosssectional study The public remained vigilant with frequent adoption of preventive measures and was generally supportive of the government. /media information was associated with greater selfefficacy of infection prevention and more hand washing. trust in informal information was related to perceived health threat and avoidance behaviors ELY Wong (38) Jun 2009 Psychological and behavioral responses in healthcare workers Community nurse respondents: 401 Crosssectional study Less than onequarter of community nurses would be willing to provide care to patients during the influenza pandemic SYS Wong (40) Jun\u2013Jul 2009 Psychological and behavioral responses Respondents: 301 Crosssectional study Previous seasonal influenza the acceptance of prepandemic influenza vaccine was generally low among healthcare workers, and seasonal vaccination experience could be the predictor of the pandemic influenza vaccine uptake KK Mak (47) May 2009 Psychological and behavioral response Secondary school students showed poor knowledge of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, low perceived risk. the adoption of preventive precautions was not prevalent and associated with female sex, better knowledge, and higher perceived risk. oseltamivir prophylaxis might protect contacts of confirmed cases against confirmed infection JHS You (52) 2010\u20132011 Costeffectiveness of oseltamivir Hospitalized patients with suspected influenza Efficacy of vaccine Empirical antiviral treatment appeared to be a costeffective strategy during influenza epidemics. immunotherapy program NA Operational study Passive immunotherapy with convalescent blood products collected from donors recovered from previous pandemic influenza infection is a logistically feasible mitigation option VCC Cheng (58) May\u2013Aug 2009 Control of transmission with school closure All laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 infection in Hong Kong Ecological study School closure could reduce pH1N1 transmission among children by 70%. 25% of transmission overall BJ Cowling (59) Jul\u2013Aug 2009 Effectiveness of entry screening 35 countries with the risk of confirmed secondary pH1N1 infection among household contacts of 65 confirmed index cases was estimated at around 6% in a contact investigation of a school outbreak of pH1N1. the risk of confirmed secondary pH1N1 infection was similar for pH1N1 and seasonal influenza in 99 households. serologic study found similar seroprevalence among healthcare workers compared with the general community. another study estimated similar risk of confirmed pH1N1 infection among clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers after adjustment for age. a study conducted in July 2009 reported reasonable acceptability of the pH1N1 vaccine. around 50% of survey respondents reported intention to receive the vaccine for free, declining to 15% if the cost of the vaccine was higher than US$25. a subsequent longitudinal study found intention to receive vaccine was an unreliable predictor of subsequent vaccine uptake. 59 Closure of kindergartens and primary schools from midjuune to July 2009 was estimated to reduce transmission within children by 75%. treatment of pH1N1 patients with oseltamivir was demonstrated to be effective in suppressing viral load and shortening duration of viral shedding. the initial effective reproduction number was estimated to decrease from around 14\u201315 at the start of the epidemic to around one during the school closures and summer vacations. the risk of confirmed secondary pH1N1 infection among household contacts of 65 confirmed index cases was estimated at around 6% in a contact investigation of a school outbreak of pH1N1. serologic study found similar seroprevalence among healthcare workers compared with the general community. another study estimated similar risk of confirmed pH1N1 infection among clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers after adjustment for age. 40 Preventive measures taken by the population against the pandemic were dependent on a variety of factors, such as knowledge about the virus 30 and the efficacy and adverse effects of protective measures. 44, 46 perceived risk of infection, 45 trust in formal/informal information about pH1N1, 37 and previous experiences with avian influenza. 59 Closure of kindergartens and primary schools was estimated to reduce transmission within children by 75%. treatment of pH1N1 patients with oseltamivir was demonstrated to be effective in suppressing viral load and shortening duration of viral shedding when administered within 48 hours of illness onset. only 63 local deaths were associated with confirmed pH1N1 infection during the first wave between April and December 2009. 127 excess deaths 6 compared with around 1000 excess deaths associated with seasonal influenza every year in Hong Kong. the agespecific risk of severe illness and death was estimated on a perinfection basis (7, 8) Identification of risk factors Healthcare workers were not at particularly high risk of infection (17, 22) Intention to receive the pandemic vaccine was low in the general population. the highest pH1N1 infection attack rates occurred among schoolage children. investigations of school outbreaks tend to overestimate transmissibility because of selection bias. serologic studies allowed robust inference on the cumulative incidence of infection through the first wave of pH1N1, 7, 8, 11, 19, 26 and when combined with surveillance data on severe cases allowed accurate estimates of the severity profile of pH1N1. the unique setting in Hong Kong facilitated some of the studies discussed here. but the uniqueness was also a limitation when considering the generalization of research findings. 68 There are some limitations of our review. a rapid and comprehensive research response to pH1N1 in Hong Kong is now being used to revise and update pandemic plans and preparedness. the experiences of the research response in Hong Kong may also provide a template for the research response to emerging and reemerging disease epidemics.
