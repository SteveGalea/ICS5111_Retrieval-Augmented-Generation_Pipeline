{"summary": "pneumonia accounted for 19% of 10.6 million yearly deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2000\u201303. pneumonia accounted for 19% of the 10.6 million yearly deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2000\u201303. the majority of HPIV-2 infections occur in children younger than 5 years of age. the viral envelope of HPIVs contains two major surface glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) proteins. the HN glycoprotein possesses the largest antigenic and genetic differences among HPIV types and strains within one type. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 2500 patients with ARI. the hospitalized children with ARI aged from 0 to 93 months were enrolled. pneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis, followed by bronchitis (30, 6.8%), bronchiolitis (21, 4.7%) and upper respiratory tract infections (16, 3.6%). no. of cases Respiratory viruses detected Diagnosis 15 HPIV-3, HCoV 15 pneumonia 5 HPIV-3, HRV 5 pneumonia 3 HPIV-3, RSV 2 pneumonia, 1 bronchitis 3 HPIV-3, HMPV 2 pneumonia, 1 bronchitis 2 HPIV-3, HCoV, HRV 5 pneumonia, 1 bronchitis 2 HPIV-3, HCoV, HRV 5 pneumonia, 1 bronchitis 1 HPIV-3, the male/female ratio in the HPIV-3 infected group was 2.21. in the HPIV-3 negative group, the ratio was 1.61. in the HPIV-3 negative group, the ratio was 1.61. pairwise distances between the sequences were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method. the numbers in the distance matrix were plotted into a histogram that formed three peaks corresponding to the distance ranges suggesting the presence of strains, sub-clusters and clusters. two distance ranges did not overlap suggesting the HPIV-3 can be unambiguously classified into two distinct categories: strains and cluster. however, a minor peak occurred between strain and cluster range, indicating the diversity of stains cluster Ccontained 52 isolates which have been isolated in recent years from Asia and had a mean nucleotide divergence of 1.8%. cluster C formed a monophylogenetic sub-cluster C3 with 2 isolates from Japan and 2 isolates from mainland China. isolates from the same epidemic season in Beijing can show a greater divergence than isolates from different sampling years. compared with all cluster A and B, ten unique nucleotide substitutions in the HN coding region were shared by all cluster C viruses. bronchiolitis (21, 4.7%) and upper respiratory tract infections (16, 3.6%). the most frequently detected virus was RSV(169, 46.2% of positive patients), followed by HCoV (134, 36.6%), HRV (123, 33.6%), HMPV (66, 18%) and HPIVs (62, 16.9%). HIPV-3 was the fifth most frequently detected viral pathogen in our study. -3, ADV, RSV, HRV 1 pneumonia, 1 HPIV-3, HCoV, HMPV, HRV 1 pneumonia, 1 HPIV-3,ADV, RSV, HRV, HMPV 1 pneumonia, 1 HPIV-3, HCoV, HMPV, HRV 1 pneumonia, 1 HPIV-3,ADV, RSV, HRV, HMPV 1 pneumonia, Epidemiology of HPIVs HPIV-3 was detected throughout the study period. the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid homologies among these Beijing HPIV-3 isolates were between 97.2 and 100% and 98.7 and 100%, respectively. the divergence between the Beijing isolates and the prototype strain Wash/47885/57 was approximately 4.6\u20135.2% and 2.3\u20133%. the threshold value of 0.045 that divided comparisons between members of the same (phylogenetically defined) cluster is shown as a dashed line. the tree constructed by the Kimura 2-Parameter method is highly similar to that produced by Maximum Likelihood method. the tree constructed by the Kimura 2-Parameter method is highly similar to that produced by Maximum Likelihood method. -clusters with bootstrap values of 91 to 100% (C1, C2, C3 and C4) with the exception of lineage C4. sub-clusters C3a, C3b and C3c were designated C3a, C3b and C3c with at least 1.5% nucleotide divergence. 443 specimens were collected from hospitalized children with ARI over 29 consecutive months. a significant rate of HPIVs infection (14%, 62/443) was observed. HPIVs were the fifth most frequent detected pathogen among the common respiratory-associated viral agents. a minimum of 50% of croup cases were caused by HPIV-1 [10], [13], [33]. however, LRIs caused by HPIV-2 have been reported much lower frequencies than LRIs caused by HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 [7]. phylogenetic analysis revealed that all known HPIV-3 isolates could be divided into three distinct clusters (A, B and C) cluster A and B contain strains mostly isolated from last century including the prototype strain, which seems to be less prevalent. cluster C contains strains isolated from India, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia during 2003 to 2009. phylogeny of HPIV-3 based on the complete HN sequence provides the most rigorous method for molecular epidemiologic studies. this is the first report have described the phylogeny of HPIV-3 based on the complete HN sequence. opharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with ARI within 7 days of the onset of symptoms in Beijing Children\u2019s hospital. the patients were diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. the clinical criteria for diagnosing pneumonia are the presence of lung infiltrates indicated by chest radiography [45]. the primers and 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labeled probes for detection of HPIV-3 were designed as previously described. Previously cultured material was used as a positive control and to validate the molecular assays. RT-PCR assays for HPIV-3 Samples were tested by a classical RT-nested PCR to amplify the HN coding region in HPIV-3 gene. the outer primer set: 3HN+(5\u2032-AAAAAAAGCACAGAGAAC-3\u2032, nt 5379-nt 5397, sense) and 3HN- (5\u2032-ACAGTGCCATTGTTAG-3\u2032, nt 8655-nt 8676, the nested reaction mixture was composed of 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 1 l of a 25 mMdNTP-mix, 2.5 mM MgSO4 5 l 10PCR buffer and 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers in 50 l reaction volume. the cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0 sequences proof reading and editing was conducted with SequencherTM. the obtained consensus sequences were compared with the prototype HPIV-3 sequences available in GenBank database using BLAST analysis. RNA Extraction Viral genomic RNA was extracted from 140 l of each NPA specimen, using the QIAamp viral RNA minikits. RNA pellets were resuspended in 60 l of sterile distilled water. adenovirus (AdV) [50], human coronavirus (HMPV) [53] and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [53] were conducted as previously described. RT-PCR assays for HPIV-3 Samples that found positive for HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 were tested by a classical. outer primer set: 3HN+(5\u2032-AAAAAAAGCACAGAGAAC-3\u2032, nt 5379-nt 5397, sense) and 3HN- (5\u2032-ACAGTGCCATTGTTAGATTCAG-3\u2032, nt 8655-nt 8676, anti-sense) were used in a one-step RT-PCR. the reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 45\u00b0C for 30 min. PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. purified PCR products were than sequenced with primers 3HNn+, P3(5\u2032-CTGAATTGTAAGAAGCCTTGT-3\u2032, nt 7094-nt 7114, anti-sense), PF+(5\u2032-CTCGAGGTTGTCAGGATATAG-3\u2032, nt 7437-nt 7457, sense), P5+( pairwise distances of nucleotide sequences in 65 sequence alignment were calculated using Kimura 2-parametermethod within MEGA 5.0 package. the distance was sorted into three categories: Strain, the distance between strains within sub-clusters; Sub-cluster, the distance between strains across sub-cluster; and Cluster, the distance between strains across clusters."}
