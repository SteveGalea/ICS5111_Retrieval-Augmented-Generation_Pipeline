{"summary": "each site was contaminated with 104 PFU of MS2 in 5 drops of 5 L each. participants performed a healthcare task (measuring blood pressure on a mannequin) and then removed PPE according to CDC protocol. participants met inclusion criteria: >18 years of age, nonpregnant, nonallergic to latex, no active skin disorders, and medical evaluation approval for N95 respirator fit testing and use (9). participants were shown the poster distributed by CDC and given an opportunity to read it and ask questions. the poster was placed in front of the participants for reference while they donned and removed PPE. the amount of virus recovered from the right hand was 1\u20133 log10 MPN for hands and 1\u20134 log10 MPN for scrubs. removal of gloves and gowns required 2 hands, mask and goggle removal was one-handed. recovery of virus was greater from the left hand than the right (1.82 log10 vs. 0.98 log10 MPN) the use of PPE impregnated with antimicrobial agents may also reduce or eliminate contamination of skin and clothes. a barrier to improving hand hygiene compliance rates is the belief that gloves make hand hygiene unnecessary (14)."}
