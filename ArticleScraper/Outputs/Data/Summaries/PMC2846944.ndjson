{"summary": "the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak infected 8,422 individuals leading to 916 deaths around the world. but there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions. the aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype. the first case was identified on 16 November 2002 in the southern Chinese city of Foshan. the outbreak infected 8,422 individuals leading to 916 deaths in eight affected areas. a large superspreading event in Hong Kong seeded the global outbreak. clinical, demographic and epidemiologic details for SARS patients from each region were collected, coded and anonymized for analysis. all analyses were based on patients who satisfied the WHO definition for 'probable cases' we calculated the age- and sex-standardized CFRs and associated exact binomial 95% confidence intervals based on the world standard population [16] we excluded all 126 patients from Hospital 309 for whom data on pre-existing comorbid conditions were not available. we chose the middle age group as the reference group. all analyses were conducted in R version 2.3.1 [19]. Sources of data We analyzed a combined database of SARS patients from Hong Kong (n = 1755), Beijing (n = 917) and Taiwan (n = 664). clinical presentation, exposure history, blood test, chest CT and X-ray scan were also reviewed in addition to the WHO definition. data were collected from all hospitals and integrated into a dataset officially maintained by the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. we compared the characteristics of SARS patients by region in terms of demographic and clinical variables such as age, age, health care worker status, pre-existing comorbid conditions. we calculated the case fatality ratios (CFRs) within subgroups of each of these characteristics. onset-to-death and onset-to-discharge distribution were log-transformed. onset-to-death and onset-to-discharge periods were log-transformed. compared the differences across the regions. data on exposure and onset times were available for 168 patients in Hong Kong, 97 patients in Beijing and 210 patients in Taiwan. fitted lognormal distributions showed good fit compared to non-parametric estimates of the incubation distribution. onset-to-admission times decreased throughout the main part of all three epidemics. onset-to-admission times decreased throughout the main part of all three epidemics. onset-to-admission times increased towards the end of the Hong Kong epidemic. patients in the youngest age group and those who had acquired SARS nosocomially had significantly shorter onset-to-death periods. non-health care workers and those with pre-existing comorbid conditions had marginally shorter onset-to-death periods. younger patients were found to have shorter lengths of stay in hospital on average. Detailed symptom data were missing for Hospital 309 patients. malaise and rigor were not documented in Taiwan. analysis based on data accounting for 40% of global case load. only one of the 680 inpatients was directly admitted, the rest were transferred from other hospitals in Beijing. admission to XTS would have required survival until at least May 1, when XTS opened. further, it is less likely that patients in serious condition would have been transferred. incubation period had mean 4.4, 5.7 and 6.9 days and a 95th percentile of 12.4, 19.7 and 17.9 days in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan respectively. together they can reliably inform the diagnostician the likelihood of SARS in a suspected case and advise the public health practitioner the appropriate period of quarantine. differences between regions may be due to different interpretations of disease onset between regions. the higher rates in Hong Kong of almost every symptom could be due to differences in reporting behavior. this again points to the need for a universal information supply chain, from case and symptom definitions to guidelines in history taking and data coding. a more recent detailed case review has found that some reported 'probable' SARS cases may have been misclassified. asymptomatic and subclinical infections of SARS were not considered in our analysis, although there is strong evidence that very few existed. data on final outcome were not available for 12 patients in Taiwan. the estimates were not shown as there was not more than 2 deaths in these age groups out of a relatively large number of patients. it indicates the relative increase (>1) or decrease (1) in the median time from onset of symptoms to death or discharge. also adjusted for interaction between location with admission before symptom onset. also adjusted for interaction between location with health care worker and pre-existing comorbid conditions. programme for research for policy support (contract SP22-CT-2004-511066)."}
