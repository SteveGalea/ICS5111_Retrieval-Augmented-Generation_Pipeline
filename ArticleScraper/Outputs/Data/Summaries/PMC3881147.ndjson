{"summary": "research on biobanks and medical databases provides opportunities for a broad spectrum of interests and applications in translational bioinformatics (TBI) many countries plan to invest in health IT research by constructing biobanks and health information databases. Personalized medicine and Telehealth may be achieved along with the development of HIT. the development of HIT usually begins with the construction of large biomedical databases. the current biomedical databases are far from clinical auxiliary diagnoses. the human Genome Project (HGP) was designed for fundamental research. the final database is standard and ready for data processing. the investment of HGP reached an unparalleled peak in the field of biology and medical science. the second strategy aims to redesign medical tools to generate automatically standard EHRs during the manipulation of doctors and nurses. it will change the machines, instead of the doctors and nurses, to avoid the conversion of medical records. the data in HSMPD are designed and standardized on the purpose of TBI, which contains large quantity of redundant information to doctors. the data in HSMPD are designed and standardized on the purpose of the healthcare system to build a prospective database as HGD. the progress is hampered by the absence of a high-capacity clinical database on human serological information. the network of signal molecules has a well-ordered structure, which has been studied worldwide for decades [4,6,11]. high-capacity databases with standardized health information are required. research on TBI has achieved considerable development on gene-related bioinformatics because of HGD. however, the high cost of data acquisition is a problem. the deficit should be covered by public funding or be shifted to the database users in the TBI community. the initial step in the HSMPD project is to develop a HSMPD-oriented tool that should be standardized and high throughput to quantify hundreds of cytokines and hormones. the information of every record is categorized into two parts. the medical SMP data is open for all researchers and patients without unnecessary ethical review. the private information of patients is protected behind firewall, which can be mediated by a trusted intermediary. the DN field will be filled automatically when doctors open their worksheets. the DN field will be filled automatically when doctors open their worksheets. doctors are responsible for the private information of their patients. the 1,536-chamber immuno-nucleic acid sequence-based amplification chip was specifically designed for HSMPD data acquisition. the chip can measure at least 1,344 kinds of hormones and cytokines in one serum sample. the chip can be employed to simultaneously measure at most 1,344 kinds of hormones and cytokines in one serum sample. the immuno-NASBA assay provides a convenient solution to quantify traces of signal molecules in samples. the chip has the same dimensions as the 1,536-well microtiter plate, thus making the chip readable in a microplate reader. the chip was not completely exploited at the pilot stage. the data acquisition was performed in a passive way, i.e., the participators were randomly involved in. Figure 5. Typical process of data acquisition in HSMPD. only 16 types of signal molecule targets were measured on the SMP chip prototype. a low-cost solution is proposed to install the HSMPD without involving an enormous scientific project such as HGP. the key of the solution lies in the cooperation of IT and instrumentation engineering and the support of traditional health care systems and the TBI community. SMP information will be decoded through a web-based program. the data will be stored in the web-based HSMPD at the same time. the serological criterion of SMP might become a popular multipurpose diagnostic tool. the PN, DN and RID fields need to be filled-in manually. the second section includes an SMP table and the following fields: RID, Machine ID (MID) and \u201cTime\u201d. this section will be filled by chip readers and related programs. the MC section in the doctor\u2019s worksheet is divided into two parts. the first part includes the symptom and complaints of the patient. the second part includes the diagnosis opinions. both parts will be consolidated into the MC field. the chips were fabricated in laminated poly(methyl methacrylate) slides. different capture antibodies were immobilized on the gold film in every chamber. the principle of immuno-NASBA assay is similar to sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), erythropoietin (EPO), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), interferon-gamma (IFN), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8. a small volume of blood samples was enough for a single SMP test investigators divided into two groups: one group interviewed the people who will get their blood tested in the blood-collection room of hospitals. the other group randomly interviewed the pedestrians in city streets far away from hospitals. the subjects were randomly selected and unfiltered. more than half of the patients were willing to accept the free tests without additional blood sampling. however, no one was willing to participate if the tests were not free. more than half of the patients were distrustful of investigators and unwilling to be interviewed. figures 6e show the points of view of the users who participated in the SMP tests. the main opinion of the users was that research data should not involve private information, but physiological information should be available for disclosure. 22.75% of the informants refused to open their own data. medical data in HSMPD must be included in the roadmap of HSMPD. the passive mode is unable to meet the needs of medical research, particularly experimental research in pharmacy. the HSMPD may help medical experimental research in the long run. the method to identify the positive or negative tone in the MC is another challenge in the creation of the HSMPD. the method to identify the positive or negative tone in the MC is another challenge in the creation of the HSMPD. the data structure of the HSMPD was optimized according to the comments about private information of patients. the privacy section cannot be accessed without the mediation of a trusted intermediary. the identity information of patients is replaced by a string of numbers, PCP, which could make each clinical record anonymous to scientists. technical issues in the HSMPD Actually, HSMPD was proposed on the basis of fundamental physiological theories. biologists always tried to find a simplex biomarker to represent the status of a specific disease, but such a one-variable function might never exist. scientists could study millions or billions of standard clinical SMP records in the HSMPD through biostatistics programs. the creation of the HSMPD will significantly assist in medical research, particularly in disease diagnosis and chronic disease management. a logical consequence is to seek alternative approaches such as having a trusted intermediary that consents on behalf of the participants. over 90% of the general informants far away from hospitals did not want to participate or refused to participate in the SMP tests, even if the tests were free of charge. more than half of the patients were willing to accept the free SMP tests without additional blood sampling. people who participated in the tests subconsciously hope to obtain additional information from the tests. it can be concluded that the people likely to accept the tests only when they spontaneously want to take blood tests. 22.75% of the informants refused to open their own data. commercialization of the medical database is essential to balance income and expenses during the construction of HSMPD. but plan B disagrees with the previous assumption that only version B is practical. comments with positive or negative tones should roughly divide the previous subset into three subclasses: positive, suspected, or negative. the method to identify the positive or negative tone in the MC is another challenge in the creation of the HSMPD. the differences of results from two methods were small. it implied that the correctness of the SMP chip was verified. but the precision of SMP chips needs further improvement. the HSMPD software of the next version might become an add-in program of current HIS system. the software of the next version might become an add-in program of current HIS system, which interfaces should strictly fit the current work habits of doctors and nurses. the creation of a public HSMPD database will greatly facilitate TBI research on the association between diseases and serological patterns of patients. the database will not release the fields of non-essential personal information, such as name, home address and birthday. the database will not release the fields of non-essential personal information. the construction of high-quality clinical database might be the main bottleneck at present for the development of TBI. however, nontechnical challenges mainly hinder the construction of HSMPD, including the high cost of data acquisition."}
