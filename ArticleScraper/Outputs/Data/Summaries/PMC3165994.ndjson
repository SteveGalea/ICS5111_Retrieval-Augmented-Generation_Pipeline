{"summary": "the sampling site was the attic of a private house in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany. the study did not involve any direct manipulations of bats and relied entirely on collecting fecal samples from the attic floor. five microliters of RNA/DNA eluate were tested by broad range reverse transcription\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) assays for the whole subfamily Coronavirinae (16), the family Astroviridae (4), and the genus Mastadenovirus (18) specific real-time RT-PCR oligonucleotides were designed within the initial PCR fragments. PCR amplicons from the initial screening assay were TA cloned in a pCR 4.0 vector (Invitrogen) Plasmids were then purified and reamplified with vector-specific oligonucleotides. the in vitro\u2013transcribed RNAs or, in case of AdVs, the photometrically quantified plasmid alone were used as calibration standards for virus quantification in bat fecal samples. the sample was the attic of a private house in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany. each sample consisted of exactly 5 fecal pellets collected in proximity. equivalent of 100 mg was purified by the Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. nmol/L of the respective primers, 200 nmol/L of the respective hydrolysis probe, 0.5 L enzyme mix or 0.1 L Platinum Taq, 1 g bovine serum albumin, and 5 L RNA/DNA extract were added. amplification involved 15 min at 55\u00b0C for reverse transcription of RNA viruses and 3 min at 95\u00b0C. PCR amplicons from the initial screening assay were TA cloned in a pCR 4.0 vector (Invitrogen) Plasmids were then purified and reamplified with vector-specific oligonucleotides. in vitro transcription was followed by in vitro transcription with a T7 promotor-based megascript kit. maternity colony was surveyed for bat-borne RNA viruses. RT-PCR assays for CoVs and AstVs were employed on samples taken in 2008. a CoV, 6 different AstVs, and 1 novel AdV were found. phylogenies were generated using an amino acid percentage distance substitution model drawn to scale, complete deletion option, and 1,000 bootstrap reiterations. vires newly identified in this study are shown in red. Sampling extended over 5 sampling dates until late July 2008. 195 pooled samples equal to 975 fecal pellets were collected during this time. 77.5% of specimens contained virus, while the succeeding 2 samples showed a statistically significant 2- to 8-fold decrease of detection frequency. arrows indicate the time of birth of the first pup. numbers on the x-axis represent individual fecal pools tested. dotted lines indicate pools that tested negative. astV, no amplification was associated with parturition in the same samples. total detection rate of astroviruses was 51.2% before birth of first pup. prevalence and virus concentration significantly increased in the second sampling. as shown in Figure 3, the CoV showed the same 2 amplification peaks as observed in 2008, one after formation of the colony and one after parturition. the detection rate during the first peak was 100.0%, followed by 2-fold and 5-fold decreases 3 and 6 weeks later (2 52.0, p0.001), and an augmentation to 97.5% after parturition (2 77.7, p0.001). the maximum CoV concentration in 2010 was higher than in 2008, at 50,495, Detection frequency for AdV was 58.6% before parturition and 40.3% thereafter without any significant variation in virus concentrations between sampling dates. 480 adult females were counted before parturition and 437 thereafter, along with 285 pups. a second census after parturition yielded 394 adults and 220 newborns. the decline in adult females and the moderate number of pups contrasted with observations made in 2010, when 480 adult females were counted before parturition. the success of Nipah virus isolation from Pteropus spp. bats depended on seasonal factors, which was interpreted as evidence for season-dependent variation of virus concentration or prevalence. the reproductive cycle of bats has been tentatively connected with seasonality of henipavirus, filovirus and lyssavirus seropositivity in bats. astVs underwent postparturition amplification only in 2010 when a new virus lineage gained predominance in the population. this finding strongly indicates antigen-specific immune control of virus circulation. a common assumption is that bats are resistant to even highly pathogenic viruses (2,3) RNA viruses ensure that they are maintained on a population level by a much higher error rate of enzymes they use for genome replication. this factor can explain why most emerging viruses, including those from bats, are indeed RNA viruses (2,35) inaccessible to domestic cats and dogs. left undisturbed by humans."}
