{"summary": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-system chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by the breakdown of immune tolerance of B and T cells to self-antigens. the pathogenesis of SLE involves an imbalance in homeostasis caused by defective clearance of pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes. central tolerance involves the deletion of self-reactive T lymphocytes in the thymus at an early stage of development 3,4 IL-35 has been shown to mediate intracellular signalling either through the heterodimer of receptor chains IL-12R2/gp130 or homodimer of each chain 11. secretion of IL-35 has been confirmed either in non-stimulated mouse Tregs or in recombinant IL-35 (rIL-35)-induced regulatory B cells (Bregs) and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 plus CD40 activated B cells 9, mice with IL-35 treatment showed elevated plasma soluble gp130 and IL-12R2 concentrations and expression of IL-35 receptor (IL-35R) on CD4+ Th cells compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment. all experiments involving live animals were carried out strictly according to the principles outlined in the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. urine collected from each group (n = 10) was analysed using the URS-5T urine strips. proteinuria scores were as follows: score 0 = 0\u201315 mg/dl, score 1 = 16\u201329 mg/dl, score 2 = 30\u201399 mg/dl. severities of vessels infiltration, interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis were scored using a macroscopic scoring system in the range 0\u20135 (0 = normal; 1\u20132 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4\u20135 = severe) the number of mesangial cells in the glomeruli was determined by counting their nuclei. purified RNA from 1 106 splenic and thymic cells was performed. mRNA expression was calculated by comparing with expression of GAPDH. Flow cytometry for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells, CD4+CD25 Teff cells and CD19+CD5+CD1d+IL-10+ Breg cells were gated from total lymphocytes. splenic and thymic cells from MRL/lpr and BALB/c mice were stained. indirect immunofluorescent staining was used to determine cell surface expression of IL-12R2 (BD Pharmingen) and gp130 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) expression of the cell surface molecules of 10 000 viable cells was analysed by flow cytometry. expression of the cell surface molecules of 10 000 viable cells was expressed as geometric mean of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI 15,24) mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. sex-matched 20\u201324-week-old adult BALB/c mice were used as normal control mice. 12\u201324-week-old adult female MRL/lpr mice were kept in a conventional animal facility. the divided MRL/lpr mice and BALB/c control mice (aged 20\u201324 weeks) were injected intravenously (i.v.) daily at the base of the tail with 800 ng/mouse of recombinant mouse IL-35 (Adipogen International, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for 7 days, and with 200 l/mouse of PBS (i.v.) daily for 7 days as control (n = 5 in each group) severities of vessels infiltration, interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis were each scored using a macroscopic scoring system in the range 0\u20135 (0 = normal; 1\u20132 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4\u20135 = severe) 23. RNA purified from 1 106 splenic CD4+ Th cells was performed using a naive CD4+ T cell isolation kit. the sequences of the amplification primers p35, EBI3, gp130, IL-12R2, FoxP3 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were listed. the real-time PCR reactions were set up according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CD4+CD25 Teff cells were gated from total lymphocytes. an IL-10+ Bregs cocktail used for B cell surface staining and phycoerythrin/cyanine dye 7 (PE/Cy7)-conjugated anti-IL-10 antibody was gated using flow cytometry. expression of the cell surface molecules of 10 000 viable cells was analysed by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was described in the section gene array hybridization and data analysis. results were expressed as mean standard error mean (s.e.m.) for normally distributed data. numerical data were expressed as median [interquartile range (IQR) if they were not in Gaussian distribution. clinical characteristics of Murphy Roths Large (MRL)/lpr and BALB/c mice before treatment MRL/lpr (n = 30) BALB/c Mild (n = 10) Moderate (n = 10) Normal (n = 10) Clinical assessment Body weight, mean s.d., g 468 76&&&& 448 54*** 464 73### 192 03 Joint swelling, mean s.d., m 896 71&&& 8 MRL/lpr = MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/2J; mild = mice with mild disease activity. moderate: moderate disease activity (moderate SLE, proteinuria score 2\u20133, age 16\u201319 weeks); severe: high disease activity (severe SLE, proteinuria score 4\u20135, age 20\u201324 weeks); and normal: age- and sex-matched healthy BALB/c normal control mice (age 20\u201324 weeks). results of IL-35-treated MRL/lpr mice found obvious remissions of nephritis and lupus disease compared with PBS treatment. differences in concentrations of plasma ANA and anti-ds-DNA antibodies among the moderate, severe SLE mice and BALB/c control mice with PBS injection. plasma concentrations of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody are presented as bar charts with the arithmetic mean plus standard error of the mean. iTreg and nTreg and Th2 cell-regulated gene expression in splenic CD4+ Th lymphocytes from MRL/lpr mice were significantly higher than Th1 cell-regulated genes (Ifng, Il12rb2, Il18r1, Il18rap, Fasl and Tbx21) these results implied an immunoregulatory role of IL-35 in splenic CD4+ Th cell differentiation. mRNA expression of p35, gp130 and IL-12R2 in each group of PBS-treated MRL/lpr mice was remarkably changed compared with the PBS treatment. most regulators of JAK/STAT pathway and cell differentiation-related genes were down-regulated more than twofold. most of the inflammatory response genes were found to be down-regulated. IL-35 exhibited its immunoregulatory effect by up-regulating the mRNA expression of IL-35 and IL-35R from splenic cells. however, FoxP3 mRNA expression from splenic cells was significantly higher in severe SLE mice with or without IL-35 treatment compared to PBS treatment. mRNA expression of p35, EBI3, gp130, IL-12R2 and forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) of thymic cells between interleukin (IL)-35 and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment. plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-35 and soluble IL-35R component gp130 and IL-12R2 were increased significantly in moderate and severe SLE mice treated with IL-35 treatment. % CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs and % IL-10+ Bregs in all groups of MRL/lpr mice, either with or without IL-35 treatment, appeared to be a decreasing trend compared to the BALB plenic, thymic and peripheral blood cells in severe SLE mice with IL-35 treatment were increased significantly. % CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells from splenic cells in mild and moderate SLE mice with IL-35 treatment were significantly higher than PBS treatment. expression of IL-35 receptor subunit gp130 and IL-12R2 exhibited a down-regulation trend on splenic, thymic and peripheral blood CD4+ Th cell surfaces. expression of IL-35R on splenic and peripheral blood CD4+ Th cell surface in mild SLE mice treated with IL-35 was up-regulated significantly when compared with PBS treatment. expression of gp130 and IL-12R2 on splenic CD4+ T helper (Th) cell surface was significantly higher than that with IL-35 treatment. plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-6 and Th17 cytokine IL-17A from severe SLE mice decreased significantly upon IL-35 treatment. plasma concentration of IL-17A from each group of MRL/lpr mice with IL-35 treatment decreased significantly compared to that of PBS treatment. plasma concentration of IL-12p70 from mild SLE mice treated with IL-35 was increased significantly compared to that of PBS treatment. the proteinuria scores and percentages of lymphadenopathy in each group of MRL/lpr mice were markedly higher than control (P 0001) all MRL/lpr mice in the moderate and severe groups had significantly higher scores of lupus flare and leucocyturia than normal control mice (P 005) joint swelling of MRL/lpr mice in the mild and moderate groups was significantly higher than the control group (P 005) leucocyturia score, mean s.d. 04 10 17 12* 23 05### 0 Lymphadenopathy, no.

IL-35 induced the increase of IL-10+ Breg cells in splenic, thymic and peripheral blood. rIL-35 signal transduction pathway was activated to exhibit only a partial suppressive activity of IL-35 compared with signalling through the fully functional IL-12R2-gp130 heterodimer receptor 11. we found no significant in vivo effect of i.v. injection with human IgG1 compared with PBS treatment. i.v. injection of recombinant cytokine for therapeutic treatment 44. i.v. injection of recombinant cytokine for therapeutic treatment 44. i.v. injection of recombinant cytokine for therapeutic treatment 44. no conflicts of interest have been declared by the authors. supporting information Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher\u2019s Web site: Table S1.
