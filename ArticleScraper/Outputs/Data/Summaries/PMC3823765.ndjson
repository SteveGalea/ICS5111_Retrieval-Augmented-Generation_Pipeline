{"summary": "YPFS composed of astragali Radix (AR; Huangqi; the root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge or Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var. mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao) and Saposhnikoviae Radix (SR; Fangfeng; the roots of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz. SR is used to expel \u201cwind\u201d, to relieve exterior syndrome, to eliminate dampness, to eliminate dampness, to eliminate convulsion and diarrhea. clinically, YPFS has been applied in anti-viral or anti-bacterial effects, which indeed has been shown to prevent viral infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathological conditions such as severe inflammation, auto-immune disease, and inflammation-associated oncogenesis are critical for the uptake and degradation of infectious agents and senescent cells. in cultured macrophages, application of YPFS was able to induce the inflammatory response by determining mRNA and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-B transcriptional activity and phagocytic activity. five chemical markers were selected based on abundant amounts in the herbs. they included: AR-derived flavonoids: calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin. the chemical fingerprint was revealed by a DAD detector. the chemical structures of 15 chosen chemical markers were shown in Figure S1. the results were to establish the chemical criteria for quality assurance of YPFS. the fragmentor voltage and collision energy values were optimized to obtain the highest value of the chemicals including the internal standards. a standardized YPFS was recommended to contain no less than the amounts of (i) AR-derived flavonoids: calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin. aesculetin (IS1), Rg1 (IS2) and chrysin (IS3) were made by a MS detector in the negative mode. YPFS (mg/g) AR (mg/g) AMR (mg/g) SR (mg/g) Calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside 0.4430.004 1.7090.021 - - Formononetin 0.2560.006 1.1740.021 - - Ononin 0.2560.006 - - Ononin 0.2560.006 - - Ononin 0.2560.006 - - On herb-to-herb interaction in chemical solubility. different compositions of herbs, based on herb ratio in YPFS, were measured. different compositions of herbs, based on herb ratio in YPFS, were boiled together. letin, isopsoralen and psoralen were slightly decreased when SR was boiled as in YPFS. the decrease was similar in a case of boiling together with AR or AMR. thus, the amounts of those chosen chemical markers were higher in a preparation of YPFS compared to that of a single herb. YPFS induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured macrophages. the maximum dose could be 3 mg/mL in the following experiments. NF-B pathway and its downstream genes were our targets of investigation. the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF mRNAs were normalized to total protein content of each cell culture well. the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF mRNAs were normalized to total protein content of each cell culture well. YPFS induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-B through enhancing degradation of IB in cultured macrophages. YPFS induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-B through enhancing degradation of IB. luciferase-reporter containing five NF-Bs and a down-stream luciferase reporter gene, pNF-B-Luc, was used in the transfected macrophages. cultured macrophages were treated with herbal extracts for 24 hours. YPFS induces the phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. macrophages were pre-incubated with different herbal extracts. they were then treated with fluorescein-labeled E. coli K-12 bio-particles. YPFS suppressed the transcript and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured macrophages. YPFS suppressed IL-1 protein expression by 20%, IL-6 protein expression by 40%, and TNF protein expression by 25% in the LPS-induced chronic inflammation model. dexamethasone (Dex) served as a positive control. the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were revealed by multiplexed bead-based immunoassay. values were normalized to total protein content of each cultured well. a typical HPLC fingerprint of YPFS was developed. chromones prim-O-glucosylcimifugin (11), scopoletin (13), calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside (2), 5-O-methylvisammioside (12), ononin (4), calycosin (1) formononetin (3), atractylenolide III (10), atractylenolide I (8) and Atractylenolide II (9) were identified in the HP the linearity, the calibration curve of each chemical was constructed using a range of concentrations of working standards. the LOD was estimated with a signal 3 times higher than the baseline noise while the LOQ was 10 times higher. the assay precision was determined by intra-day and inter-day variations. tylenolide II (9), atractylenolide I (8), esculin (IS4), crytotanshinone (IS5) were made by a MS detector in the positive mode. a standardized YPFS was recommended to contain no less than the amounts of (i) AR-derived flavonoids: calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside. 1850.024 - - Astragaloside II 0.0730.027 0.3320.106 - - Astragaloside III 0.1080.008 0.3560.021 - - - Atractylenolide II 0.0440.001 - 0.0570.004 - - Atractylenolide III 0.3090.006 - 0.3200.012 - Prim-O-glucosylcimifugin 0.6950.013 different compositions of herbs, based on herb ratio in YPFS, were boiled together. solubilities of AR-derived flavonoids, including calycosin-7-O--D-glucoside, calycosin, ononin and formononetin were much better in YPFS. values served the minimal amount of chemicals for a standardized YPFS. the chemical markers included AR-derived flavonoids (A) and saponins (B), AMR-derived sesquiterpenoids (C), SR-derived chromones (D) and coumarins (E) were determined in water extracts of different herbs, a combination of two herbs. YPFS induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured macrophages. mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF were stimulated by YPFS in a dose-dependent manner. maximum induction was achieved at about 2 to 20 folds under treatment of 1\u20133 mg/mL of YPFS. NF-B is well-known to play a pivotal role in regulating expressions of cytokines and chemokines in acute phase inflammatory response. a specific NF-B inhibitor BAY 11-7082 was used to clarify the activation effects of YPFS on expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. effect of YPFS on degradation of NF-B inhibitory protein IB was determined in the present or absent of BAY 11-7082. pre-treatment with 5 M BAY 11-7082 for 3 hours, LPS could only induce 60% degradation of IB. 3 mg/mL of YPFS could induce the degradation of IB in a time-dependent manner. cultured macrophages, transfected with pNF-B-Luc, were treated with herbal extracts for 24 hours. LPS (1 g/mL) was used as a positive control. the cell lysates were subjected to luciferase assay. YPFS induces the phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. cultured macrophages were pretreated with 1/mL extract of AR, AMR, SR and YPFS separately for 3 hours. thirty g/mL Zymonsan A was used as a positive control. extracts from single herb showed the suppression effects as that of YPFS. dexamethasone (Dex) served as a positive control. YPFS suppresses the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured macrophages. YPFS of having 3 different herbs together during the preparation promoted strongly the solubilities of different chemcials. this phenomenon of herb compatibility has been revealed similarily in another herbal formula-Danggui Buxue Tang. this phenomenon of herb compatibility has been revealed similarily in another herbal formula. the principal herb of YPFS is AR that contains 0.751.81% by weight of flavonoids including calycosin and formononetin. these flavonoids induce the gene expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis of red blood cell production in a dose-dependent manner. this conentration of flavonoids in YPFS was highly enriched to about 4 mg/g of dried Y yPFS-suppressed expressions of LPS-induced cytokines are IL-1, IL-6 and TNF. yPFS-suppressed expressions are IL-1, IL-6 and TNF.
