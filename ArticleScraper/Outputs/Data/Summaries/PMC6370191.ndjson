{"summary": "the world\u2019s urban population grew from 2259.24 million in 1990 to 3784.39 million in 2013 (52.74% of the world\u2019s population) IEA estimated that energy-related carbon emissions in cities would grow by 1.8% annual, with the proportion of carbon emissions in cities rising from 71% to 76% during 2006 to 2030[7]. cities are also the major components in the implementation of carbon emissions mitigation measures. energy consumption and CO2 emissions should be reduced by 15% and 18% in 2020, respectively, compared with the 2015 levels [18]. 85% of emissions are contributed by energy consumption in cities, which is much higher than that experienced in the u.s. (80%) or in the EU (69%). current research on carbon emissions in cities focus on two research strands. current emissions reduction targets are mainly based on Scope 1 emissions. findings of previous studies indicated that developed regions outsourced more emissions to other regions at the global [25], national [26] and local [27] scales. comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city-level carbon emissions accounting, as well as local emission mitigation strategies [28]. al.[44] 1997\u20132010 SDA Beijing Tian et al.[46] 1996\u20132010 LMDI and Tapio index Beijing, Tianjin Wang et al.[47] 1998\u20132009 STIRPAT Shanghai Zhao et al.[49] 1996\u20132007 LMDI Shanghai Shao et al.[50] 1994\u20132011 LMDI Tianjin Li et al.[52] 1996\u20132012 STIRPAT Tianjin Tan the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [59\u201362], owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period-wise or time-series manner. the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors. economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments. energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions. previous studies focused on economic growth effect, energy intensity effect, population size effect, and technology progress effect. city Tianjin city Chongqing city Guangzhou city Location Municipality North Municipality East Municipality North Municipality Southwest Provincial capital Southeast Area (Sq.km.km.) the innovation and contribution of this study compared with other references mainly lies in two aspects. urban emissions inventory is the key for city-level total carbon accounting. however, there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [21]. the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules. 19.8885 0.3102 16.7568 4.2526 2.7134 4.692 3.1889 13.2952 Allocation from Other Provinces (cities) 19.7639 0.2456 0 13.3683 20.4704 32.7119 3.8337 13.118 Allocation to Other Provinces (cities) -0.344 0 0 -9.4359 -18.2254 -28.9829 -0.8366 0 Imports 0.3978 0 16.7265 0 0.06 0 0 1.5751 0 0 0.931 3.0671 Rural Areas 0.0026 0 0 0.1566 0.0085 0 0.1718 1.7237 Then, we calculated energy-related carbon emissions by energy types according to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table. 89 Crude oil 1.429 t ce/t 0.43000 20.08 0.96 Kerosene 1.471 t ce/t 0.44000 18.90 0.96 Kerosene 1.471 t ce/t 0.44000 19.60 0.96 Diesel oil 1.457 t ce/t 0.43000 21.10 0.96 Nature gas 1.330 t ce/103 m3 3.89310 15.32 0.98 LPG 1.714 t ce/t 0.47000 20.00 0.97 the Kaya identity was extended as follows: C = k = 1 n C i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) represents carbon emissions from agriculture (i = 1), production (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) represents the various energy types in this case study, mainly including coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, diesel oil, kerosene, fuel oil, LPG, natural gas, and electricity.
