{"summary": "domain II is rich in protease cleavage sites. residues 251 to 394 were removed and replaced by amino acids 274 to 284, which contain a furin cleavage site lysosome resistance. ADA neutralizes the activity of antigens by binding to surface residues. the human B-cell epitopes in domain III were mapped using monoclonal antibodies made in mice. the strategy was based on the assumption that B-cell epitopes are made up of large amino acids. mutating these to Ala will prevent binding to antigen receptors on B cells.

ADA neutralizes the activity of antigens by binding to surface residues. onda et al18 mapped the murine surface (conformational) B-cell epitopes in PE38 using monoclonal antibodies made in mice. i.v. HA22 (250 g/kg; circle) or HA22-LR-8M (500 g/kg; triangle; arrows) were immunized with SS1P, LMB-T20, or phosphate-buffered saline (arrows) ADA formation is delayed but not abolished. elimination of all B-cell epitopes from a molecule is challenging. elimination of all B-cell epitopes from a molecule is challenging. repeated immunization of nave and sensitized mice with the T-cell deimmunized variant induced a low ADA titer that did not neutralize the RIT and did not compromise anti-tumor activity. we compared computational-based human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding analysis with experimental T-cell epitope mapping. peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were expanded in vitro for 14 days with the entire RIT. the addition of an in vitro expansion step was based on the work from the laboratory of Sette and colleagues40. the addition of an in vitro expansion step was based on the work from the laboratory of Sette and colleagues. analysis of the epitopes that were underpredicted revealed that some of the epitopes would have been predicted positive if the threshold had been loosened. however, one epitope was completely overlooked by the algorithm. overpredictions are expected because of the multiple steps in T-cell activation that cannot be predicted by the algorithm. DP alleles failed to recognize this epitope as a strong binder. this indicates that HLA binding algorithms are not sufficient to accurately predict some T-cell epitopes. however, they do a better job at predicting DR restricted epitopes than DP. the toxin in LMB-T20 was linked to an Fv that targets human CD25 to kill human T-cell malignancies. deletion of domain II significantly impaired the cytotoxic activity. to better kill CD25-expressing cells and decrease immunogenicity, we retained domain II and deimmunized it by introducing three point mutations into domain II. the final RIT (LMB-T14) has good cytotoxic and anti-tumor activity versus human cell lines, patient-derived cells, and xenograft tumor models. to validate the reduced immunogenicity of LMB-T14, we compared the ability of LMB-T14 to bind to serum from patients treated with SS1P. however, the mutations D463A and R467A, introduced to eliminate a conformational B-cell epitop MB-100 antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) mice were immunized with LMB-100 before tumor inoculation (black arrows) tumors were then treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; green arrows), LMB-100 (black arrows), or LMB-100 + SVP-R. we evaluated SVP-R in combination with LMB-100, a RIT that is deimmunized from human B-cell epitopes but elicits ADA against both the human Fab and the toxin in mice. this immune tolerance resulted in restoration of anti-tumor activity in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse that would otherwise be neutralized by the ADA. es are eliminated by deleting domain II and introducing a point mutation in domain III that prevents T-cell activation. repeated immunization of nave and sensitized mice with the T-cell deimmunized variant induced a low ADA titer that did not neutralize the RIT. 16 immunized patients represent the HLA distribution of the patient population in the united states and Europe. in vitro expansion before T-cell epitope mapping improves the specificity because it eliminates activation by irrelevant peptides that are not processed to form functional peptides. analysis of the epitopes that were underpredicted revealed some of the epitopes would have been predicted positive if the threshold had been loosened. one epitope was completely overlooked by the algorithm. overpredictions are expected because of the multiple steps in T-cell activation that cannot be predicted by the algorithm. eight human T-cell epitopes were then analyzed to identify point mutations that can diminish T-cell reactivity and yet not compromise RIT cytotoxic activity. alanine mutant peptides screened all responsive donors to each epitope with the mutant peptides. MB-T18 and LMB-T20 have improved cytotoxic activity and anti-tumor activity in cell lines, patient-derived tumor cells, xenograft mice, and patient-derived xenograft mice. it has high cytotoxicity on liver cancer cell lines as well as good anti-tumor activity in mice. the final RIT (LMB-T14) has good cytotoxic and anti-tumor activity versus human cell lines, patient-derived cells, and xenograft tumor models. we compared the ability of LMB-T14 to bind to serum from patients treated with SS1P and remapped the T-cell epitopes using peptides from the mutated sequence of LMB-T14. anti-tumor efficacy of LMB-100 is restored by addition of SVP-R. mice were immunized with LMB-100 before tumor inoculation (black arrows) mice were challenged with LMB-100, PBS, or LMB-100 + SVP-R. selective delivery of rapamycin to these immune organs generates a tolerogenic milieu that can induce specific immune tolerance to coadministered antigens. we evaluated SVP-R in combination with LMB-100, a RIT that is deimmunized from human B-cell epitopes but elicits ADA against both the human Fab and the toxin in mice."}
