{"summary": "autophagy is a homeostatic process by which cells break down and recycle cytoplasmic organelles and protein aggregates that are too large to be degraded by the proteasome. autophagosomes can fuse with vesicles of the endocytic pathway to form amphisomes that eventually fuse with lysosomes where the sequestered material is degraded. the same autophagy machinery has diversified functions in higher eukaryotic organisms so as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of acute and chronic liver diseases worldwide. 130\u2013170 million people are persistently infected with HCV and have a high risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. a hallmark of HCV is its high propensity to persist with up to 80\u201390% of infected individuals failing to eliminate the virus. the single open reading frame is located between two untranslated regions (UTR) that contain RNA sequences essential for RNA translation and replication. HCV infection is initiated by binding of enveloped viral particles to cell surface receptors, followed by internalization into endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner. progeny viral genomes are either translated to produce additional viral proteins or packaged to assemble progeny infectious virus. y proteins can enhance HCV infection, and discuss implications of those concepts for the survival of HCV in infected cells. the phenotype does not require HCV cell entry nor the production of infectious virus. several viruses have been reported to induce a cellular ER stress response. the unfolded protein response (UPR) can induce autophagy. the virus may be triggered by viral polyprotein synthesis or viral replication in the ER or ER-derived structures. autophagy proteins, i.e., Beclin 1, LC3, Atg4B, Atg5, Atg7 and Atg12, are required for productive HCV infection [41\u201345]. autophagy proteins, i.e., beclin 1, LC3, Atg4B, Atg5, Atg7 and Atg12, are required for productive HCV infection [41\u201345] cytosolic receptors (e.g., RIG-I, MDA5, NLRPs) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) present in endosomal/lysosomal compartments of the cell. autophagy proteins are emerging as key regulators of the innate host response against viral infection by either activating or inactivating antiviral molecules in infected cells. Ke and Chen showed that down-regulation of Atg5 markedly increased IFN promoter activation triggered by overexpression of a constitutively active RIG-I mutant in vitro. lysosome maturation is required to repress HCV-PAMP-induced RIG-I signaling, and autophagy reciprocally decrease this signaling. autophagy proteins limit VSV-induced IFN and ISG expression. HCV aborts the RIG-I-induced innate immune response by NS3/4A-dependent proteolysis of IPS-1 [95\u201398] which blocks the induction of IFN and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in HCV-infected cells. confocal microscopic analysis of HCV-infected cells provides little evidence of colocalisation of LC3 and viral proteins. Ferraris et al. detected DMVs in fractions containing HCV RNA and proteins that apparently co-sedimented with LC3 [68], suggesting that some viral elements may be present in structures resembling autophagic vesicles. autophagy proteins are recruited to certain domains of the ER or to closely attached structures. autophagy proteins or autophagic vesicles may provide an initial membranous support for translation and replication of incoming RNA. a restricted subset of autophagy markers may localize transiently at the site of HCV translation and replication. rautou et al. recently reported evidence for an increased autophagic response in the liver of chronically HCV infected patients relative to the normal liver and to patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B infection [121]. further work will be necessary to reconcile our fragmented and sometimes conflicting understanding of the role of autophagy in HCV infection. cer regimens and the possibility that autophagy may be a legitimate target for the development of antimicrobial drugs [125,126] are very exciting areas in biomedical research. it is conceivable that inhibition of autolysosome maturation may, directly or indirectly, repress HCV propagation."}
