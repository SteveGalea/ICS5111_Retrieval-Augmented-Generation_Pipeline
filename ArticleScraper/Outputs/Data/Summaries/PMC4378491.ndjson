{"summary": "PDCoV strains OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 were detected in samples. samples were negative for PEDV, rotavirus groups A\u2013C, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)/porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and caliciviruses. Pig 2 was monitored for long-term clinical signs and virus shedding until day postinoculation (dpi) 23. all animal-related experimental protocols were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. OH-FD22\u2013infected pig 2 was immunized intramuscularly with OH-FD22 from the gnotobiotic pig\u2013passaged intestinal contents that were semipurifed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (11) and mixed with complete and incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvants at dpi 30 and dpi 44 (11) Tissues from control pigs 6 and 7 and PEDV-infected gnotobiotic pigs (8) pig-passaged OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 samples were negative. RT-PCR results were negative for PEDV, rotavirus groups A\u2013C, TGEV/PRCV, and caliciviruses. fecal shedding occurred at hpi 48 at the onset of diarrhea. the detection limit of the PCR was 4.6 log10 GE/mL for a fecal sample and 3.6 log10 GE/mL for a serum sample. Pig 1 vomited at days postinoculation 21\u201324 and then had diarrhea. clinical signs or lesions did not develop in negative control pigs. intestinal changes in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with PDCoV strains OH-FD22 (panels A, B, E, G, I, and J) trophied villi are positive for PDCoV RNA (original magnification 200) jejunum of pig 3 at hpi 72 (48\u201351 h after onset of clinical signs) showed large numbers of PDCoV antigen\u2013positive cells in the epithelium of atrophied villi. no cells showed staining; +, 1%\u201329% of epithelial cells showed staining; +++, 60%\u2013100% of epithelial cells showed staining. other internal organs showed no ISH or IF staining. no other internal organs of infected pigs showed in situ hybridization-positive or immunofluorescence-positive staining. viremia was detected frequently in symptomatic PEDV-infected pigs."}
