{"summary": "96 papers met the eligibility criteria. main research themes considered were evaluation of infection control effectiveness. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was most commonly modelled HCAI (34%), followed by vancomycin resistant enterococci (16%) HCAI continues to cause a major burden on society, causing an estimated 16 million additional bed-days responsible for \u20ac7 billion in direct medical costs. in the united kingdom, interventions such as improved hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship and screening combined with decolonisation are believed to have set off a steep reduction in reported incidence of health care-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. terms and medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for nosocomial organisms and antibiotic resistance were combined with search terms for healthcare settings and mathematical models. the final search was conducted on 11 December 2011. no editorials or letters to editors were included, except if a new mathematical model was introduced. no editorials or letters to editors were included, except if a new mathematical model was introduced. number of HCAI modelling publications over time (1993\u20132011) number of studies identified on modelling of HCAI and antimicrobial resistance spread in a nosocomial setting according to year of publication. HCAI models have involved antimicrobial susceptible pathogens as well. HCAI: Healthcare associated infections; ILI = Influenza-like illness; SARS = Severe acute respiratory syndrome; TB= Tuberculosis; R-GNR= Third generation cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative rods; HIV = Human immunodeficiency virus; ESBL = Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases; CRE = cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. individual-based model A model in which single individuals are tracked rather than subgroups. model fitting/ model calibration The inference of unknown parameters by choosing their values in order to approximate a set of data as well as possible. hospital surveillance data, which is frequently used to inform HCAI models, can lack detail in what is needed for modelling purposes. for example, information on asymptomatic carriage and timing of events (e.g. infection) are often lacking. only three studies explored transmission of HCAI in lower and lower middle income countries. studies have mainly concentrated on the united states (16%; 15 studies), the united kingdom (13%; 12 studies) and the Netherlands (10%; 10 studies). patient cohorting 2007 [40] Gown and glove use 2009 [32] Other 2006 [43] VRE Hand hygiene 1998 [12,21,28,47,49,51,54,55] Antibiotic stewardship 1999 [47,51,55] Isolation 2004 [12,52] HCW cohorting 1998 [12,49,51,54,55] Screening 2004 [47,52] Decolonisation 2007 [50] Patient cohorting 2008 [47] Environmental cleaning 2008 [47] C. models using deterministic vs. stochastic and a compartmental vs individual-based modelling approach by the total number of publications in each time period. a proportion of studies use a combination of the above listed modelling approaches (e.g. a deterministic compartmental model complemented by a stochastic individual-based model) Figure5b Model methods Proportion of models that are fitted to data, have included uncertainty and are validated by consultation of two different datasets by total number of publications in unknown parameters, such as infection transmission rates, can be inferred by calibrating a model to empirical data. only 35% of HCAIs models have incorporated some sort of calibration process to empirical data, but this proportion has increased over time. the more computationally expensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis is considered a rigorous method to account for uncertainty in the joint distribution of the parameters. this was employed by 51% (18 studies) [14,32,36,40-42,48,50,57-59,64],[75,76,78,95,96,98] among which Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) as a means of performing probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted by four studies. more recent studies have incorporated the interaction between general wards and the ICU [23,43,69] or between different wards. only two models concerned nosocomial transmission in a LTCF setting alone, i.e. of influenza [98] and norovirus [104] respectively. HCAI was the most common bacterial species studied (34%; 33 studies) [14-46], followed by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) (or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci) (3%; 3 studies) [58-60] as several studies investigated the dynamics of more than one pathogen, the total number of infection agents (N=102) listed in Figure 3 exceeds the total number of studies (N=96) a wider variability of interventions has been evaluated in the later years.

MRSA was the most common bacterial species studied (34%; 33 studies) [14-46], followed by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) (16%; 15 studies) whereas C. difficile has rarely been the subject of a model (3%; 3 studies) [58-60]. Figure 4 provides an overview of the main interventions modelled over time. a wider variability of interventions has been evaluated in the later years. a model should be validated against observations from alternative data. bi/ multivariate sensitivity analysis Investigation of uncertainty in model parameters by means of alteration of two (or more) parameters at a time whilst holding others at their base-case value. probabilistic sensitivity analysis A type of multivariate sensitivity analysis where multiple runs of the model are performed with random selection of input parameters. three recent papers applied dynamic modelling techniques to estimate the economic burden of disease (MRSA) [22] and norovirus [69], and to investigate economic incentives for infection control investments [73]. a number of studies did not specify a particular national setting. a stochastic and deterministic version of a similar compartmental model is used to investigate if projected intervention effects were partly a result of random fluctuation. others use a deterministic model to interpret the findings of a stochastic model. axis 2007 [79] Antibiotic stewardship 2008 [93] HCW cohorting 2005 [91] HIV Sterilization of medical appliances 1999 [94] Influenza or ILI Vaccination 2008 [95-97] Prophylaxis 2009 [98] Other 2008 [99,100] Pertussis Vaccination 2009 [72,101] Rotavirus Hand hygiene 2011 [81] HCW cohorting 2011 [81] Vaccination 2011 [81] SARS Isolation 2007 [102] HCAI models can have either an aggregate (or compartmental) structure (which tracks groups in the population) or an individual-based structure (which tracks individuals) most HCAI models have taken an aggregate approach, although the proportion of individual-based models has increased over time. univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted by 43% (15 studies) of 35 studies that have investigated parameter uncertainty, univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted by 43% [18,28,29,43,44,46,60,63],[69,77,81,83,89,91,99] of the 35 studies that have investigated parameter uncertainty. four studies (5%) reported some kind of model validation based on at least two different data sets. only one study used a statistical approach. others included subjective comparison of the model predictions (on infection transmission) with genotype data. only two models concerned nosocomial transmission in a LTCF setting alone, i.e. of influenza [98] and norovirus [104] respectively. a stochastic modelling approach may often be more appropriate as it can take account of the role of chance in determining transmission patterns.

Figure5b Model methods Proportion of models fitted to data, have included uncertainty and are validated by consultation of two different datasets by total number of publications. only 35% of HCAIs models have incorporated some sort of calibration process to empirical data. this proportion has increased over time. a further seven studies reported fitting their models by comparing model predictions to observed epidemiological data. the more computationally expensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis is considered a rigorous method to account for uncertainty in the joint distribution of the parameters. this was employed by 51% (18 studies) [14,32,36,40-42,48,50,57-59,64],[75,76,78,95,96,98] among which Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) as a means of performing probabilistic sensitivity analysis. more recent studies have incorporated the interaction between general wards and the ICU or between different wards [11] only two models concerned nosocomial transmission in a LTCF setting alone, i.e. of influenza [98] and norovirus [104] respectively. occurrence of models does not necessarily correlate to the burden of disease. this is also true in low and middle income countries. but very few modelling studies have tackled the problems of HCAI in less developed settings. this review intended to provide overall trends in the field of HCAI modelling, rather than a detailed account of the quality of individual models. emergence of individual-based modelling allows for more realistic modelling of healthcare worker-patient contact (e.g. super spreading events) or incorporation of heterogeneity in transmission risk profiles of patients. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors are grateful to referees for valuable suggestions and advice."}
