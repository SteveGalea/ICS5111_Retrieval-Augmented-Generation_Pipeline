{"summary": "cat presented for evaluation of pink masses in the right eye, uveitis and secondary glaucoma in the left eye. she was being treated with topical prednisolone acetate 1% in both eyes. aphakic crescent were present in the left eye. white infiltrates were visible adjacent to the ciliary body and posterior to the lens bilaterally. differential diagnoses included iris masses in the right eye, bilateral uveitis, and lens subluxation in the left eye. chronic uveitis is the most common cause of lens subluxation in the feline. glaucoma may occur due to a change in aqueous humor dynamics associated with a shift in lens position. glaucoma is also a sequela to feline anterior uveitis. lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and the most common secondary intraocular tumor in cats. solitary conjunctival and ocular lymphoma is believed to be rare in dogs and cats. intraocular lymphoma is generally considered to be part of multicentric disease. FeLV-antigenemic cats have significantly shorter remission and survival times than FeLV-negative cats (16) low grade lymphoma is often referred to as small cell lymphoma. achieving a complete remission is a reliable prognostic factor. iris masses in the right eye, bilateral uveitis, and lens subluxation in the left eye. differential diagnoses for iris masses include primary intraocular tumors, post-traumatic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, metastatic carcinoma, and osteosarcoma (1\u20135) lens subluxation and glaucoma were most likely secondary to chronic uveitis in the feline. glaucoma may occur due to a change in aqueous humor dynamics associated with a shift in lens position. glaucoma is also a sequela to feline anterior uveitis. cytology revealed neoplastic round cells most consistent with a lymphoid tumor. the right eye was enucleated the following day and submitted for light microscopic examination. the diagnosis was confirmed as intraocular B-cell lymphoma. low grade lymphoma is often referred to as small cell lymphoma. low grade lymphoma is associated with prolonged survival. achieving a complete remission is a reliable prognostic factor. biologic behavior with other forms of extranodal lymphomas is largely unknown in cats so that a combination of local therapy (such as surgery) to control the primary disease in combination with systemic therapy (chemotherapy) to prevent systemic progression of the cancer is often recommended."}
