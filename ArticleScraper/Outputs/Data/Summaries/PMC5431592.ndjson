{"summary": "a method for intravascular staining of memory T cells has been developed. the method has been widely used to define memory T cells in many organs and tissues. however, memory T cells in the respiratory tract are located in three unique anatomic locations. cell strainers (70 m nylon) (Corning, Falcon\u00ae, catalog number: 352350) 60 x 15 mm tissue culture dish (Corning, Costar\u00ae, catalog number: 353802) 10 ml stripettes (Corning, Costar\u00ae, catalog number: 3548) Gauze sponges (4 x 4 inch) 0.2 m filter (EMD Millipore, catalog number: SCGPU11RE and SLGP033RS) 2.5 ml graduate transfer butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 152463) nano-pure water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, InvitrogenTM, catalog number: 10977015) RPMI medium 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, GibcoTM, catalog number: 11875093) HEPES (1 M) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, GibcoTM, catalog number: 15630080) L-glutamine (200 mM) 100x ( complete RPMI 1640 medium (see Recipes) Digestion buffer (see Recipes) ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes) ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes) ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes) 1 ml insulin syringe with a 28 G x needle (for intravenous labelling) put a plastic desiccator in a fume hood followed by 5 ml of isoflurane. Immediately after the rate of respiration slows, pick up the mouse, hold it vertically and slowly deliver 100 l of CD45-BV510 antibody onto the mouse nostrils. download video file (9.9MB, mp4) Harvest cells from airway (see Video 3) Prepare a 1 ml syringe with 20 G x 1 needle. Carefully pass about 1.25 inches 20 G tubing onto the needle. Sharpen the end of the tubing with scissors. cut through the abdominal cavity to expose the underside of the diaphragm. remove the ribcage to fully expose the heart and lung. use tweezers to break the right atria to allow blood to drain from circulation. spin down lung cells for 5 min at 400 g at 4 \u00b0C in a bucket tabletop centrifuge. neutralize the ACK buffer with 30 ml of ice cold DPBS. resuspend the cells in 5 ml of ice cold FACS buffer. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element. you may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. phycoerythrin (PE), APC, BV (or their derivatives)-conjugated antibodies are preferentially chosen because these molecules have large molecular weights. make sure to tape over the center hole in the plastic desiccator grate because small mice are sometimes able to squeeze through this hole and jump into the bottom, isoflurane-filled chamber.
