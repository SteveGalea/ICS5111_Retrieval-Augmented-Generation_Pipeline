ODs of uterine artery segments were not different between groups (236.0 12.0 vs. 240.0 7.0 m, n = 4 in each group). Resting tension also was similar in both groups (1.75 0.09 vs. 1.77 0.09 mN/mm2). giotensin-converting enzyme 2 knockout (ACE2 KO) and C57Bl/6 mice at day 14 of gestation. stress-stretch response (A) and its rate constant (B) (n = 4 in each group); vasodilatory response to acetylcholine (C) and endothelial NOS immunostaining (D) (n = 4 in each group); contraction to phenylephrine (E) (n = uterine arteries from ACE2 KO mice showed greater maximal response to phenylephrine, with no difference in sensitivity. sensitivity to Ang II decreases during pregnancy, we compared the reactivity of uterine arteries to Ang II. greater responses to phenylephrine and Ang II in ACE2 KO mice were associated with lower fibrinoid content as assessed by PAS staining. there were no differences observed in the intensity of actin or myosin between ACE2 KO and C57Bl/6 mice. no differences in uterine artery peak systolic or minimum diastolic velocities or resistance index of ACE2 KO compared with C57Bl/6 mice. data are means SE; n = 4\u20136. cross-sections of the placenta were immunostained for the hypoxia marker pimonidazole and HIF-2. pimonidazole staining was higher in the trophospongium and the labyrinth of the ACE2 KO vs. C57Bl/6 placentas. ACE2 knockout is associated with reduced fetal weight at late pregnancy. increased uterine artery reactivity to vasoconstrictors, abnormal uterine artery remodeling, and placental hypoxia. ACE2 KO mice have a higher response of the uterine artery to potassium chloride than WT mice, suggesting increased hypertrophy or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. however, immunostaining for contractile proteins such as -smooth muscle cell actin showed no difference and myosin staining only tended to increase. hypertrophic and hyperplastic processes are unaffected by ACE2 at least in midpregnancy at the level of the uterine artery. uterine arteries of ACE2 KO mice were more responsive to phenylephrine than WT controls. increased contraction of the main uterine artery to phenylephrine late in pregnancy was also seen in eNOS knockout mice. the response of uterine artery to Ang II is opposed by the AT2R. it is possible that vasodilation mediated by the AT2R is attenuated in this vascular bed. total knockout of AT2R in mice induces late-pregnancy hypertension. Ang-(1\u20137) can bind to AT1R in vitro when used at higher micromolar concentrations. Ang-(1\u20137) can activate AT2R so the lower density of AT2R might limit actions of Ang (1\u20137) in vivo. ang-(1\u20137) increases skin blood flow in normotensive pregnant women. velocities or resistance in pregnant ACE2 KO vs. WT mice at day 14 of gestation suggest that modest fetal growth restriction in ACE2 KO mouse is not accompanied by alterations in uterine artery hemodynamics. differences in trophoblast invasion may develop as pregnancy progresses and the fetus grows. increased hypoxia of the placenta results in less vascular labyrinth with abnormalities in the fetoplacental capillary bed. hypoxia increases maximal responses to potassium chloride and the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 in human isolated chorionic plate arteries. IUGR is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in humans. uterine artery dysfunction in ACE2 KO mice is associated with placental hypoxia and greater uterine artery reactivity to vasoconstrictors.
