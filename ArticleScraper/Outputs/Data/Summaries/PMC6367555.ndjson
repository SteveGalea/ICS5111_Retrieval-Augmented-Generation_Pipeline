{"summary": "the neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques, intraneuronal tangles, and activation of glial cells 1-4. astrogliosis is a characteristic reaction of astrocytes to inflammation, oxidative stress and trauma, leading to the secretion of several potentially toxic products, including inflammatory agents 1 and oxidative stress mediators 5. the chemokine CXCL10 is found in high concentrations, suggesting a pathogenic role for this chemokine and its receptor, CXCR3 12. plaque burden and A levels were strongly reduced in CXCR3-deficient APP/PS1 mice and CXCR3 antagonist increased microglia A phagocytosis 12. this study was to examine the protein expression of CCL1 chemokine and its receptor CCR8. experimental research on mice was performed with the approval of the ethics committee on animal research of the University of Valencia (Spain) mice were used to examine motor function and memory and learning functions using active avoidance and object recognition tests and motor coordination. the tests were performed at different ages (at 7, 21 and 24 months) a paw slip was defined as any paw coming off the top of the beam or any limb use on the side of the beam. a paw slip was defined as any paw coming off the top of the beam. four trials were performed before recording the results. RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and multiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) samples were run in triplicate, and expression changes were generated by calculating 2-Ct. blots were washed three times and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedure. monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. monoclonal anti-CCR5 antibody and anti-CCR8 antibody from Abcam Biotechnology. APP/PS1 and Wild type mice (N=25, 6 months) were used to examine motor function and memory and learning functions using active avoidance and object recognition tests and motor coordination (rotarod test) the tests were performed at different ages (at 7, 21 and 24 months) a paw slip was defined as any paw coming off the top of the beam or any limb use on the side of the beam. four trials were performed before recording the results. the test was performed in one single day and consisted of 50 trials per animal. the object recognition or location index was calculated as follows: time of exploration of novel object + time of exploration of novel object. the ability of mice to pass through a narrow beam to reach a dark box is evaluated. a white light illuminates the beginning of the beam. tical brain samples were collected from each mouse into an RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), an RNA stabilization reagent. concentration and integrity were assessed in RNA 6000 Nano Labchips using Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer. ready-to-use primers and probes from the assay-on-demand service of Applied Biosystems were used for the quantification of selected target gene. blots were washed three times with a washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20) for 15 min each and then incubated for 1 h with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Barcelona, Spain) RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and multiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) samples were run in triplicate and expression changes were generated by calculating 2-Ct. protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry method 17. horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody washed three times and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedure. blots were washed three times and developed using a bio-Rad scanning densitometer. a significant number of foot faults in the beam-walking test was observed in APP/PS1 mice 22-24 months compared to Wild type mice (p0.001). a significant number of foot faults in the beam-walking test was observed in APP/PS1 mice 22-24 months compared to Wild type mice. mRNA expression of CCL1 chemokine and its CCR8 receptor in brain cortex was determined by real-time RT-PCR from APP/PS1 and Wild type cortex in mice. also we assessed CCR8 protein expression by RT-PCR and Western-blot techniques in all mice. mRNA expression of A: CCL3, B: CCL4 and C: CCL5 and D: CCR5 by Western-blot in APP/PS1 and WT mice. IL-3 regulates proliferation, survival and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. IL-3 prevents neuronal death induced by A and has been detected in higher expression in AD. APP/PS1 mice at 7 and 22-24 months did not display general motor and muscular impairment. a significant number of foot faults in the beam-walking test was observed in APP/PS1 mice 22-24 months compared to wild type mice. GFAP is an astrocyte protein marker and MAP-2 a marker of microtubule assembly in neurons. expression of GFAP was higher in APP/PS1 cortex at 7 months compared with Wild type mice. Conversely, we noted a decrease in MAP-2 expression on APP/PS1 compared with Wild type mice. expression of CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 chemokines and the CCR5 receptor decreased in transgenic compared to wild type mice. mRNA expression of A: CCL3, B: CCL4 and C: C: CCL5 and D: CCR5 by Western-blot in cortex of APP/PS1 and WT mice. IL-3 regulates proliferation, survival and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. super-family of proteins are present in brain and harness the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to transport substrates across cellular membranes and power cellular machinery. also ABCF1 is important in translation initiation. inflammatory cells are a major mechanism for attacking opsonized targets while activated glial cells can produce large amounts of ROS/RNS by various mechanisms 10. transgenic mice (APP/PS1) (22-24-months) display severe motor incoordination and amnesic impairment on both object recognition memory and object location memory. this is related to the action of promoting chemotaxis of mononuclear cells and phagocytosis 22. a decrease in CCL1 expression could indicate a reduction in communication between neurons and microglia in the CNS. a decrease in CCL1 expression could explain the decline in elimination of A by phagocytosis detected in AD 28. a decrease in CCL1 expression could explain the decline in elimination of A by phagocytosis detected in AD 28. the role of CCR5 has been studied in the context of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection 35. in 1996, different laboratory groups indicated that CCR5 is a major co-receptor for the entry of HIV into target cells 36-38. studies by man and collaborators 48 show that AD patients had a higher CCL3 level compared to healthy controls in peripheral T lymphocytes. a study in 2017 showed that an increase in CCL3 expression produced accumulation of glial cells, monocytes and lymphocytes in a hypoxia mouse model. inflammatory conditions 57 suggest additional pathways to increase immune cell transport across BBB. astrocytes, A and CCL4 location in the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. a clean-up of amyloid toxicity occurs inside the brain of APP/PS1 mice. lethal and abcf1+/- mice are fertile and develop normally in adults. this protein was highly correlated with active proliferation and differentiation of cell types 64. it is expressed in many tissues, including brain, where it is particularly expressed in pyramidal cells, cerebellar Purkinje cells and in hippocampus. authors' contributions SLV conceived of and designed the study, collected data, interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript. AJ and MPR did the majority of the experiments, interpreted the data and interpreted the data. OC did behavior experiments and interpreted the data."}
