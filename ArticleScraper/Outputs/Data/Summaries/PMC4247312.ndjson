{"summary": "osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is a devastating, irreversible and disabling disease. the function of the hip joint is markedly impaired when the femoral head collapses. glucocorticoid therapy was the most common cause of ONFH (2). the protein levels in serum, joint fluid and bone tissue correlate to the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (5), the autoimmune response in ankylosing spondylitis in animal models (6) and the loss of cartilage integrity in osteoarthritis (7). however, the changes detected in the serum protein profile of patients with SONFH have not yet been reported. the supernatant was centrifuged at 2,500 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. high abundance proteins, such as albumin and immunoglobulin G, were depleted with the ProteoPrep\u00ae Blue Albumin & IgG Depletion kit. samples were further cleaned with the Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare) the 2D-DIGE was run in triplicate for each sample to reduce the gel-to-gel variation. all gels were stained with Deep Purple and stored for subsequent mass spectrometric identification. proteins were considered differentially expressed if the abundance showed >1.5-fold change between the patient and the control groups. Serum protein samples prepared as described above were diluted 1:25 in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride. membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. in total, 12 healthy volunteers, including five females and seven males, were enrolled in the control group. in total, 12 healthy volunteers, including five females and seven males, were enrolled in the control group. the protein concentrations of samples were adjusted to 8 mg/ml and verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. the labeling kit was used for tagging, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the labeling reaction was carried out in the dark on ice. protein identification was carried out on the Ettan MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. each spectrum corresponded to the sum of 200 acquisitions for each of eight laser pulses. each spectrum corresponded to the sum of 200 acquisitions for each of eight laser pulses, in which the threshold signal/noise exceeded a set value. ELISA ELISA assays using a microtiter plate assay were performed individually on the samples in each group chosen randomly. primary and secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) Approximately 1,600 protein spots were detected across all four gels by the DeCyder image analysis software (GE Healthcare) Fig. 1A shows the superimposed images in pseudocolor from Cy3- and Cy5-labelled sera samples and the positions of the spots corresponding to the proteins revealed by 2-D DIGE analysis. 2-D DIGE, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; mw, molecular weight. protein identification The above four differential protein spots were excised and digested with trypsin in gel for MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting. western blot analysis and ELISA to confirm the differential expression of these four proteins. levels of C4, ITIH4, A2MG and C3 are significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. levels of C3, C4 and ITIH4 are significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. 12 patients with SONFH (age, 32.32.3 years; range, 25\u201340 years) and 12 healthy volunteers (age, 332.3 years; range, 28\u201341 years) were enrolled. there was no significant difference in the age between the SONFH and healthy volunteer groups. g protein from each extract were run in parallel and followed by Deep Purple staining. the decrease of the protein abundance was consistent with the result of CyDye labeled images. protein identification The above four differential protein spots were excised and digested with trypsin in gel for MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) the four proteins were respectively inter--trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), complement component 4 (C4), A2MG and C3 (Table I) no change was observed in the levels of C3, C4 and ITIH4 in necrotic bone tissues. levels of C4, ITIH4, A2MG and C3 are significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. it is important to find the diagnostic biomarkers for SONFH. in the blood was significantly altered in patients with SONFH. apoptosis plays a major role in SONFH. limited studies have systematically elucidated the mechanism by which the immune system affects SONFH. the complement factor C3 precursor plays an important role in the homeostasis of inflammation, necrosis or apoptosis in ONFH. a2MG is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases (MMP) (22), which is synthesized by hepatocytes in the liver. small amounts of A2MG are also produced by a number of other cells. a2MG regulates several key factors of SONFH. lower A2MG may affect the process of SONFH through these aspects. Consistent with the bone tissue, the serum level was also decreased. this underscores the critical role of A2GM in the development of SONFH."}
