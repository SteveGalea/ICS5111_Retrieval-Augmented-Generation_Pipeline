{"summary": "small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) represent a class of regulatory RNAs responsible for posttranscriptional maturation of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) box C/D RNAs are responsible for 2\u2032-O-methylation. box H/ACA snoRNAs are responsible for pseudouridylation of nucleotides. box C/D snoRNAs share two conserved elements: boxes (PuUGAUGA) and D (CUGA) located at the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-termini of the RNA molecule. a complex of box C/D snoRNA with nucleolar proteins Nop1p (fibrillarin), Nop56p, Nop58p, and Snu13p (15.5 kDa) catalyzes site-specific 2\u2032 box H represents a conserved ANANNA (N stands for any nucleotide) motif. box ACA is a trinucleotide located 3 nt before the 3\u2032-terminus. a 9-13-nt-long guide sequence is located on both strands of the inner loop. two brain-specific box C/D RNAs SNORD115 (HBII-52) and SNORD116 (HBII-85) were shown to be processed into smaller RNAs that can affect the outcome of alternative splicing of various pre-mRNAs. SNORD115 is also involved in the regulation of serotonin receptor 5-HT2CR mRNA level in brain cells through alternative splicing and control of posttranscriptional nucleotide modification. most of sdRNAs preserve conserved C/D or H/ACA box pairs. several sdRNAs were found to interact with Ago family proteins. however, the mechanism underlying the biogenesis of such snoRNA derivatives that resemble microRNAs remains unknown. snoRNA expression levels in human and mammalian cells may underpin the development of diagnostic approaches and generation of novel therapeutic agents. in mammalians the majority of snoRNAs are encoded within the introns of protein coding or noncoding genes, so-called \"host-genes\" snoRNA expression may result from the oncogenic processes accompanied by changes in transcriptional activity of the host-gene or aberration of nuclear maturation of the pol II transcript targeted repression of fibrillarin and other proteins of the methyltransferase complex led to the decrease in box C/D snoRNA level. siRNA knockdown of fibrillarin in cancer cells enhanced induction of tumor suppressor p53 protein. however, increased fibrillarin expression resulted in significantly compromised p53-dependent response to stress in cancer cells. ACA11 is highly expressed in multiple myeloma, colon, esophageal, and bladder cancers. overexpression was found to induce downregulation of ribosomal protein genes and snRNA involved in oxidative stress regulation. the integration of the viral genome causes aberrations in host-gene expression leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. the expression of two snoRNAs U44 and U47 was found upregulated in colorectal tumors compared to benign colon tissues. squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) low expression level of U44 directly correlated with poor survival of patients [37, 47] the DNA methylation status of the CpG islands within 2 kb from 5\u2032-termini of 49 snoRNA genes was analysed in colorectal cancer cells. the results suggest the existence of epigenetic control mechanism for the regulation of snoRNA expression, which might be common for various cancer cells. the relationship between the deregulation of snoRNA expression and rRNA biogenesis in diseases remains elusive. a new diagnostic system with 81.1% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity was proposed based on simultaneous assessment of three snoRNAs (SNORD33, SNORD66, and SNORD76) plasma levels. the same, but often heterozygous, 2-nt mutation in U50HG (SNHG5) gene is present in breast cancer cells. the return to the wild-type expression level of the snoRNA results in inhibited cancer cell growth. expression profile of snoRNA and scaRNA genes was analyzed with quantitative RT-PCR. small nucleolar RNAs supplement the set of therapeutically and diagnostically significant regulatory RNAs. the fundamental knowledge of snoRNA structure and biological functions can be applied to the development of new therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. small nucleolar box H/ACA RNA SNORA42 is overexpressed in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), was identified as a lung cancer oncogene [38]. snoRNA knockdown of SNORA42 results in reduced cancer cell growth (H460 and H1944 cells), inhibited H460 and H1944 cell colony formation, and compromised tumorigenicity. adeno-associated virus integrates with high-frequency on chromosome 12 near meg3 gene locus. this region is rich in orphan snoRNA and microRNA genes. the integration of the viral genome causes aberrations in host-gene expression leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. snoRNA expression level was found decreased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, compared to normal cells. underexpression has been reported for several orphan box C/D RNAs. SNORD112-114 has been shown to promote cell cycle progression through G0/G1 to S phase transition. the expression of box C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs in HCT-116 and SW48 cells was downregulated. the result obtained suggests the existence of epigenetic control mechanism for the regulation of snoRNA expression. the expression of other noncoding RNA genes is also known to be regulated by changing the methylation status in adjacent chromosome regions. all 6 snoRNAs are present in a stable form in human blood plasma. levels of SNORD33, SNORD66, and SNORD76 do not reflect stage of malignancy or histological origin. a homozygous 2 bp deletion in U50 snoRNA gene was found in prostate cancer cell lines. box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNA expression profiles were found to vary within different types and subtypes of cancer. different leukemia subtypes shared the most similarity. snoRNA levels enables us to use snoRNA and scaRNA patterns. SNORD115 (HBII-52) and SNORD116 (HBII-85) may have an impact on 5-HT2CR serotonin receptor mRNA level in brain. deletion of critical region that contains the SNURF-SNRPN locus leads to changes in splicing patterns of several pre-mRNAs [18], 22. snoRNAs and Viral Diseases Viral infection leads to the transcriptional activation of a vast group of genes that are related to the innate immune response genes. the activity of such genes is aimed at suppressing the processes of viral development, particularly replication and transcription of viral genome, translation of viral mRNAs, and virus assembly. a 24-nt RNA represents a 3\u2032-terminal fragment (41st to 64th nt) of the viral box C/D RNA, v-snoRNA124pp, was found in cells infected with EBV. v-snoRNA124pp is able to interact with BALF5 mRNA and induce specific hydrolysis of target mRNA in the region of complementarity. levels of the viral box C/D RNA and its shortened endonuclease NendoU bears striking homology to cellular XendoU. poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease A from Xenopus laevis involved in snoRNA processing (e.g., U16 and U86 snoRNA maturation) it is known to be broadly conserved among Metazoa, but its homologues in human and most laboratory animals remain hypothetical. changes in snoRNA levels in mammalian cells were shown to be induced by different stress factors. snoRNA levels can also occur in mammalian cells exposed to chemical stress factors. snoRNAs are encoded within different introns of the ribosomal protein L13a. despite upregulation of snoRNA, there was no detectable change in 2\u2032-O-methylation level of rRNAs. the suppression of U32a, U33, and U35a box C/D RNA genes in cells resulted in inhibiting accumulation of reactive oxygen species. however, there are breast cancer types not susceptible to tamoxifen. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide-derived inhibitor targeted to HIV reverse transcriptase. it is allowed for administration to HIV-infected patients as part of complex antiretroviral therapy."}
