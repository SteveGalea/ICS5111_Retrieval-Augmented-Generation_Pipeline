{"summary": "vaccination saves 2\u20133 million lives per year globally. most of the viral (Mumps, Rubella, Measles, Varicella and Rotavirus) diseases traditionally affecting childhood all over the world are now preventable with vaccines. effective vaccines exist that prevent chronic infections by human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), which in some cases cause cancer. malaria and tuberculosis together kill almost 3 million people every year. the total number of deaths increases even more if we include those caused by vaccine preventable infections in areas where vaccines are not available to the population. polysaccharides derived from the capsule of various strains have been conjugated to protein carriers and mixed in the same vaccine. a glycoconjugate strategy could not be adopted for Meningococcus serotype B because its capsular polysaccharide is similar to a self antigen. traditional vaccines have been able to prevent diseases caused by pathogens. the challenge for the future is even higher if we consider that the infections caused by some of the most variable pathogens are not preventable only by antibodies but by cellular immunity. the success of future vaccines against highly variable pathogens depends on the ability to induce a universal B cell response, characterized by the production of functional antibodies that can crossreact with multiple variants of the same antigen. reverse vaccinology has been efficiently adopted for bacterial pathogens that have a high degree of antigen variability. in silico selected antigens have then been expressed as recombinant proteins and used to immunize mice. this approach has been adopted for the development of a vaccine that was able to prevent infection by most Men B strains in mice. the interrogation of human B cell response to infection can lead to the identification of crossreactive protective epitopes. this process has been called analytical vaccinology and is based on the recent development of several methods of generating human monoclonal antibodies. tralizing 91% of primary isolates tested in the form of pseudoviruses bind a conserved epitope in the CD4 binding site of the Env protein. the same approach has been used for identification of human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize human CMV infection. the identification of conserved epitopes in HIV and flu that are target of broadly neutralizing antibodies is only the first step for the development of universal vaccines. novel adjuvants must be formulated with antigen delivery systems and immunomodulators. it has been well known for a long time that adjuvants can increase the amount, quality and the duration of the antibody responses to vaccination. the addition of oil in water emulsions MF59 and AS03 to H5 pandemic flu vaccines was required for protection (seroconversion) MF59 enhanced both H5specific CD4 and memory B cell responses to vaccination. the increased breadth of the response to H5 induced by MF59 was associated with the recognition of an increased number of epitopes on HA. eliciting multifunctional adaptive responses Adjuvants have been very efficient in boosting antibody and CD4 responses to subunit vaccines. but the induction of CD8 by subunit vaccines relies on crosspresentation mechanisms is generally very poor. a primeboost strategy was implemented in the HIV trial RV144. subjects have been primed with a canarypox vector encoding gag, env and protease and boosted with a gp120 subunit vaccine. the trial showed for the first time 31% efficacy against HIV1 acquisition. systems biology approaches have been already successfully applied to humans vaccinated with the Yellow fever vaccine YF17D. the new biological information discovered by systems biology approaches helped to better understand the mechanism of action of the vaccine. a more rational vaccine design will hopefully allow the development of effective preventive vaccines for all remaining \u2018difficult\u2019 targets including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis."}
