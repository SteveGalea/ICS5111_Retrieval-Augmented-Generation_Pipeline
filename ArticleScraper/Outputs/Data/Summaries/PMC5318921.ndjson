{"summary": "a prospective observational study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela. informed consent was asked from patients receiving M-PC. Thrombocytopenic patients were transfused according to the Spanish transfusion guidelines. the blood transfusion center of Galicia supplies blood to 31 hospitals and a population of about 2.7 million inhabitants in the Northwestern region of Spain. it collects approximately 105,000 whole blood and 6,700 apheresis donations per year. this technology uses riboflavin (vitamin B2) and UV light to inactivate contaminating white blood cells. the protocol for a prospective observational study was submitted to the ethical committee of the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela and granted approval before the start of the study. patients receiving M-PC had to sign an informed consent form before starting therapy. cell Counting Cell counters from three departments were used. Sysmex XT-20001 (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) at the blood transfusion center. Advia 2120i (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) at the hematology department. patients receiving at least 1 U of M-PC had to sign an informed consent form before starting therapy. patients were excluded if they were refractory to platelet transfusion or showed active bleeding. Statistical analyses were performed by means of Statsoft Inc. (2012) STATISTICA (data analysis software system), version 12 (Dell Statistica, Tulsa, OK, USA). CI (count increment) and CCI (corrected count increment) were calculated using following formulas. 6% of patients were transfused with M-PC at days 6 and 7. one patient was excluded due to refractoriness. 55% of patients were male. 65% and 42% of transfusions showed CCI levels above the internationally accepted threshold for successful transfusions. 65% and 42% of transfusions showed CCI levels above the internationally accepted threshold for successful transfusions of 7,500 for CCI1h and 4,500 for CCI24h. acute leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). b NHL, including B-cell lymphoma. c Marrow aplasia, including aplasia and hypoplasia. d Non-hematological, including post-cardiac surgery and liver cirrhosis. patients 55 patients were enrolled initially. one patient was excluded due to refractoriness. the mean age of patients was 58 years (range 32-82 years) 65% and 42% of transfusions showed CCI levels above the internationally accepted threshold for successful transfusions. 65% and 42% of transfusions showed CCI levels above the internationally accepted threshold for successful transfusions of 7,500 for CCI1h and 4,500 for CCI24h. acute leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) b NHL, including B-cell lymphoma. c Marrow aplasia, including aplasia and hypoplasia. study design was chosen to enable a performance as close as possible to the routine process at the hospital. previous studies could show a clear relationship between transfusion failures defined as increments below international recognized thresholds. reactions were considered possibly related to the transfusion of the blood product. this rate is far below the observed rate of 8% reported elsewhere for pathogen-inactivated platelet products treated with an alternative technology."}
