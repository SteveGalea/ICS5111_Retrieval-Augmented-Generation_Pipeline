{"summary": "hybridoma technology that relies on animal immunization has been traditionally employed [3], [5] for the development of target-specific antibodies without animal immunization. the most recent tools require repeated screenings in order to isolate potential candidates from the library. the development of new tools to quickly isolate antibodies against rapidly spreading infectious viruses is urgently required. the sorted cells need to be regenerated for the next round of sorting. this can be done by cultivating the cells for at least one day [6], [9], [10] or by re-cloning the genes, which takes several days [11]. in addition to the regeneration time, contamination of the sorted cells by non-specific clones also needs to be considered. the whole FACS screening rounds of the synthetic human antibody library against each viral antigen could be done in one day. the results show that repeated FACS screening without regeneration of the sorted cells can be a rapid and efficient method to isolate potential antibody candidates in case of urgent requirements. cell pellets were resuspended in 5 Tris-KCl buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 750 mM KCl) the cells were incubated with 5 M of antigen peptides (N1, PreS2 or VP1 epitope) conjugated with FITC for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. fluorescent probe-labeled cells were sorted using a high-speed flow cytometer. the cells were selected on the basis of high fluorescence intensity detection. the cells were immediately reused for the next round of FACS sorting without regeneration. the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C. the cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in the same buffer. the soluble lysates were filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter. pMoPac1-GST-N1, pMoPac1-GST-PreS2, or pMoPac1-GST-VP1 were cultivated in 500 mL of LB medium in a 2-L shaking flask at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and were then lysed by sonication (20 min at 50% the GST-fused antigens were mixed with 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) to a final concentration of 2 M. each well was washed four times with PBS-T. each scFv sample (soluble lysate or purified sample) was loaded on to the plate. a 0.5 mg of antigens in 0.5 mL were prepared in morpholinoethanesulfonic acid buffer. a 0.25 mL of 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine (15 mg/mL) in 0.1 M MES buffer was added. the buffers were exchanged to PBS via dialysis. isolated scFvs were inoculated into LB medium (10 g/L of tryptone, 5 g/L of yeast extract, and 10 g/L of NaCl) after an overnight cultivation at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm, the cells were transferred into 100 mL of fresh LB medium without glucose in a 500-mL flask and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. cell pellets were resuspended in 5 Tris-KCl buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 750 mM KCl) the cells were incubated with 5 M of antigen peptides conjugated with FITC for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the fluorescent probe-labeled cells were sorted using a high-speed flow cytometer (Moflo XDP, Beckman Coulter, FL) in FACS sorting, the cells were selected on the basis of high fluorescence intensity detection through a 530/40 band-pass filter for obtaining the FITC emission spectrum. the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C. the cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in the same buffer. the soluble lysates were filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter. pMoPac1-GST-N1, pMoPac1-GST-PreS2, or pMoPac1-GST-VP1 were cultivated in 500 mL of LB medium in a 2-L shaking flask at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and were then lysed by sonication (20 min at 50% the GST-fused antigens were mixed with 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) to a final concentration of 2 M. each well was washed four times with PBS-T. each scFv sample (soluble lysate or purified sample) was loaded on to the plate. a 0.5 mg of antigens in 0.5 mL were prepared in morpholinoethanesulfonic acid buffer. 0.25 mL of 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine (PDEA) (15 mg/mL) in 0.1 M MES buffer was added. the buffers were exchanged to PBS via dialysis. mM PDEA and 1 M NaCl solution in 0.1 M sodium acetate were injected for 4 min. binding signal was detected on a 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. the cells producing FlAsH-tagged MBP were enriched from overwhelming amount of non-fluorescent cells (1104 dilution) by repeated FACS screening. a fully synthetic human antibody library with six diversified complementarity-determining regions was constructed. the clones containing in-frame genes of each chain produced the functional -lactamase fusion proteins in the periplasm and were selected using ampicillin-containing agar plates. through sequencing experiments, we found that all the clones contained in-frame codons, and no stop codons were observed within the coding genes. from the selected clones, all in-frame scFv genes were rescued and cloned into pMoPac the synthetic library was screened as shown in the Figure 1. cells were harvested and treated with 5 Tris-KCl buffer. cells were mixed with 5 M of N1 antigenic peptide conjugated with FITC. cell fluorescence was analyzed by FACS. the 5th round sorted cells were used for regeneration of scFv genes by PCR. black bar indicate signals from BSA coated wells and grey bars indicate signals from GST-fused N1 antigen coated wells. the closed and open symbols represent the coating of GST-fused N1 antigen and BSA on 96-well plates. from the sequencing experiments, we found that among the 16 clones, six clones had the same DNA sequences. two other clones, S8 and S12, were also same clones, while another two, S3 and S10, were same. the same clones with the same sequences showed similar levels of binding activity. scFv genes from the final 1,412 sorted cells were regenerated by PCR, cloned into pMoPac16, and then transformed into E. coli strain Jude-1. most clones exhibited good binding activity against antigen PreS2 of HBV, but among the 20 clones, four (SP1, SP4, SP14, and SP19) exhibited relatively higher binding activity than the other clones. the 4th round sorted cells were used for regeneration of scFv genes by PCR. black bar indicate signals from BSA coated wells. grey bars indicate signals from GST-fused preS2 antigen coated wells. we randomly picked 20 clones and obtained four clones expressing active scFvs against the VP1 antigenic epitope. the four scFvs (SV7, SV9, SV19, SV20) that showed high binding were purified for further analyses. one scFv (SV7) has much higher binding activity than the others. Symbols: circle, square, triangle and diamond represent the purified antibody from clones SV7, SV9, SV19, and SV20 respectively. ELISA analysis using FMDV serotype O kit of which wells are coated with inactivated real FMDV. binding activity of isolated antibody against each antigen was also determined by SPR analysis. each scFv could bind specifically to its own viral antigen-fused GST in the soluble lysate of E. coli host. each antibody could be isolated not by non-specific binding of antibody on the cell surface (stickiness) but by specific binding of antibody to antigen probe. this means our strategy is valid for rapid isolation of antibody from library. synthetic human antibody library with six diversified complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) was constructed. the single chain variable fragment (scFv) was designed to have eight framework regions (FRs) and six CDRs. clones were rescued and cloned into pMoPac16 for constructing a synthetic human antibody (scFv) library. from the selected clones, all in-frame scFv genes were rescued and cloned into pMoPac16 for constructing a synthetic human antibody (scFv) library. the size of the final constructed library was about 3.3106. cells were mixed with 5 M of N1 antigenic peptide conjugated with FITC. the cells from the original library showed a slightly higher, but mostly similar fluorescence intensity. the most fluorescent cells (top 0.28% of the total population) were sorted until the number of sorted events reached 510,434. the closed and open symbols represent the coating of GST-fused N1 antigen and BSA on 96-well plates. the closed and open symbols represent the coating of GST-fused N1 antigen and BSA on 96-well plates. the same clones, S8 and S12, were also same. scFvs of three clones S1, S5, and S7 could be purified with high purity. but we failed to purify scFv of clone S16. the binding activities of three purified scFvs against the N1 epitope were analyzed. cloned into pMoPac16, then transformed into pMoPac16 strain Jude-1. among the regenerated clones, 20 total colonies from the plate were randomly picked. four (SP1, SP4, SP14, and SP19) exhibited relatively higher binding activity than other clones. the VP1 antigenic epitope of FMDV Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease infecting cloven-hoofed animals. the disease has resulted in massive livestock losses around the world. we chose the VP1 antigenic epitope of FMDV as another target antigen. isolated scFv (SV7) showed high binding activity against whole (inactivated) FMDV. negative control M18 scFv, which can specifically bind to anthrax toxin PA, showed negligible signal. binding activity of isolated antibody against each antigen was also determined by SPR analysis. each antigen was immobilized on CM5 chip and the purified antibodies were loaded and binding affinities were analyzed. affinity can be overestimated due to avidity effect of dimerized or multimerized antibodies. non-immune synthetic antibody libraries have been developed in human antibody frameworks [24], [25] instead of an immune antibody library. in the synthetic library, the quality and diversity are of particular importance in the isolation of the antibody. in the synthetic library, the quality and diversity are of particular importance in the isolation of the antibody; therefore, the selection of framework in the synthetic library also needs to be considered seriously. libraries were subjected to in-frame selection by fusion with -lactamase and ampicillin resistance selection. the quality of the library was validated by sequencing clones selected randomly from the constructed library. most clones selected randomly from the constructed library and isolated clones by screening exhibited good expression levels with high solubility in E. coli. the overall procedure from cell cultivation to final round sorting could be completed in one day. stressful conditions during the FACS screening process and antibody expression can severely affect cell viability. the use of this unfavorable population in the next round of screening makes it difficult to isolate positive clones. large size (>10 kDa) probe cannot be used for screening against big size antigens including whole virus. our strategy can be easily combined with APEx system. cells can be labeled with big size antigens, and the positively labeled cells can be isolated by repeated sorting.
