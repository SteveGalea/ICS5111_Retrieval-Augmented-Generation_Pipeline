{"summary": "HMGB1 has been identified as a late-acting mediator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced or sepsis-induced lethality in mice. HMGB1 also functions as an inflammatory cytokine when passively released from necrotic cells [3] or actively secreted from stress-received cells. HMGB1 can potentially amplify local inflammatory responses by enhancing the release of cytokines and chemok glycyrrhizin (GL) has no effect on the production of these cytokines. it inhibits a significant increase in ALT levels and apoptotic cell numbers. glycyrrhizin is a biological active substance extracted from the licorice root. GL inhibits HMGB1 chemoattractant and mitogenic activities. previous findings demonstrate that oxidative stress in hepatocytes leads to early shuttling of HMGB1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm, attended with its subsequent release in the absence of cell death. mice were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal injection of a mixture of 0.15 mg/kg LPS and 20 mg GalN per mouse. mice were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal injection of a mixture of 0.15 mg/kg LPS and 20 mg GalN per mouse. HMGB1 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Serum HMGB1 was measured by ELISA using commercially available kits (HMGB1 ELISA Kit II; Shino-test, Sagamihara, Japan) the sensitivity of the assay was 1.0 ng/mL. double immunofluorescence staining was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies for HMGB1 (1100) and rat monoclonal antibody for F4/80 (1100; ab6640, Abcam), that recognized a cytoplasmic antigen in monocyte-derived macrophages and Kupffer cells [36], [37]. the immunoreactions were completely absent in control sections. HMGB1- or acetylated-lysine-positive stained nuclei were counted in two high-power fields of x 400 per mouse at each stage. the results were expressed as a percentage of total number of hepatocute nuclei. 10 L of the 10 assay buffer was added to each cell. the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. the sample was read in an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm. the size of the area was measured by using an Image Processor and Analyzer (TRI/2 D-MES; RATOC, Tokyo) cellular density was expressed as the cell number per square millimeter. the supernatant was processed with a silica-based spin column. real-time PCR was performed with the control, LPS/GalN, and GL+ LPS/GalN groups. total RNA of the sample was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and made into cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) PCR reaction was observed using Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR systems. PCR condition was as follows: 50\u00b0C 2 min, 95\u00b0C 10 min, 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 min. mice of the BALB/c strain weighing 23\u201325 g and aged 6 weeks were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) the animals were maintained in an environmentally controlled room (241\u00b0C, 5510% humidity) with alternatively 12-hour light-dark cycles. effects of GL on liver damage were examined 8 h after LPS/GalN-treatment. HMGB1 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Serum HMGB1 was measured by ELISA using commercially available kits. HMGB1 (1100\u20131400; ab18256, Abcam lnc, Cambridge, UK) to acetylated lysine (150\u20131100; ab61257, Abcam), or to NF-B p65 (11000; ab7970, Abcam) double immunofluorescence staining was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies for HMGB1 (1100) and rabbit monoclonal antibody for F4/80 (1100; ab6640, HMGB1- or acetylated-lysine-positive stained nuclei were counted in two high-power fields of x 400 per mouse at each stage. results were expressed as a percentage of total number of hepatocute nuclei. 10 L of the 10 assay buffer was added to each cell followed by 5 L of the colorimetric substrate. the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. the sample was read in an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm. labeled cells were determined in one to six fields per liver. the size of the area was measured by using an Image Processor and Analyzer. cellular density was expressed as the cell number per square millimeter. real-time PCR was performed with the control, LPS/GalN, and GL+ LPS/GalN groups. total RNA of the sample was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and made into cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System. PCR reaction was observed using Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR systems. PCR condition was as follows: 50\u00b0C 2 min, 95\u00b0C 10 min, 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 min. time-dependent changes of serum ALT, AST, and HMGB1 levels in mice treated with LPS/GalN. the intravenous administration of LPS/GalN in the mice stimulated liver inflammation associated with alteration in HMGB1 levels. sections showing histopathological conditions of control (C), 3 (D), 6 (E), 8 (F) and 10 h (G) are found in the hepatic lobuli. strong tissue injury is observed in the pericentral area at 8 h. each value represents the meanSEM of 6 animals. GL-treatment performed 30 min before LPS/GalN injection strongly inhibited both inflammatory foci and enhancement in serum levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1. immunohistochemistry with antibodies against HMGB1 revealed a distinct nuclear expression in the hepatocytes of control mice. at 10 h a distinct nuclear expression for HMGB1 was again significantly increased in the hepatocytes. GL-treatment strongly inhibited immunoreactivity of cytoplasmic HMGB1. a decrease in intranuclear immunoreactive products induced by injection of LPS/GalN. HMGB1-positive cells are simultaneously stained with antibodies to F4/80. cellular expression of HMGB1 in Activated Kupffer and dendritic cells. activated Kupffer and dendritic cells expressed HMGB1 during hepatic injury. a part of F4/80+ Kupffer and CD11c+ dendritic cells were immunolabeled for HMGB1. HMGB1in mouse liver subjected to concomitant administration of LPS/GalN was assessed by immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antibodies against acetylated-lysine. liver cells with nuclear immunoreactivity for acetylated-lysine were significantly increased in number 1\u20133 h after treatment. some cells expressed weak cytoplasmic immunoreaction for acetylated-lysine. some liver cells expressed cytoplasmic acetylated-lysine in the pericental areas. administration of GL remarkably reduced the immunoreactive, cytoplasmic and extracellular response to acetylated-lysine. colorimetric assay for histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity shows that the cytoplasmic (I) and nuclear (J) HDAC activity is increased in both liver tissues after LPS/GalN- or GL+LPS/GaIN-treatment compared with baseline animals, but not significant. association of HMGB1 with TLR4 or RAGE in mice with LPS/GalN TLR2, 4 and RAGE has been so far identified to be implicated in HMGB1 signaling. mRNA levels of these receptors induced by LPS/D-GalN-treatment were measured using real time PCR. few TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the liver of saline-injected control mice. numbers of TUNEL-positive cells with sharply delineated masses or crescents of condensed chromatin were identified in the inflammatory pericentral areas at 8 h post-injection of LPS/GalN. mRNA expression patterns of 4 genes, Pdcd6, Gsto1, Cyp2d10, and Stc1 were influenced by injecting LPS/GaIN or LPS/GalN with GL. expression levels of Pdcd6, Gsto1, and Cyp2d10 were down-regulated in LPS/GalN-injected liver injury and recovered by injection of GL. HMGB1 is implicated in apoptosis signaling in liver remnants treated with LPS/GalN. expression pattern of Pdcd6 (A) is not influenced by LPS/GalN treatment. expression levels of Gsto1 (B) and Cyp2d10 (C) mRNAs are significantly decreased. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed. we designed several respective PCR primers to amplify Gsto1, Cyp2d10, or Stc1 promoter regions. HMGB1 protein strongly bound to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-injected liver injury. an elevation in serum concentrations of HMGB1 was significantly greater by 10 h. thereafter, increased ALT, AST, and HMGB1 levels were reduced with time after treatment. HMGB1 contributed to hepatic injury in mice treated with LPS/GalN. hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections showed signs of acute liver injury. at 6 h injured hepatocytes were scatteredly distributed within the lobules. inflammatory foci were observed in the pericentral area. immunoreactions for HMGB1 in the nuclei began to be suppressed 6 h. at 8 h intranuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced. at this stage, immunolabeled HMGB1 was restricted to inflammatory pericentral areas. at 10 h a distinct nuclear expression for HMGB1 is significantly increased in the hepatocytes compared with 8 h after treatment (E, G) GL-treatment strongly inhibits immunoreactivity of cytoplasmic and extracellular HMGB1 (F) and significantly retrieve a decrease of intranuclear immunoreactive products (H) a part of F4/80+ Kupffer and CD11c+ dendritic cells were simultaneously immunolabeled for HMGB1. activated Kupffer and dendritic cells expressed HMGB1 in their cytoplasm during the hepatic injury. hyperacetylation shifts the equilibrium of HMGB1 from a predominant nuclear location toward cytosolic accumulation. ine in the nuclei began to be suppressed and immunolabeled products were extracellularly stained in the pericentral areas. extracellular acetylated-lysine expression was frequently found at 8 h. at this stage, immunolabeled acetylated-lysine was exclusively restricted to the inflammatory pericentral areas. immunohistochemistry with antibodies against acetylated-lysine (A\u2013H) and HDAC activity (I, J) the hepatocytes with nuclear immunoreactivity are significantly increased in number 1\u20136 h after treatment (B, C, G) administration of GL remarkably reduces the immunoreactive, cytoplasmic and extracellular response to acetylated-lysine in the pericentral areas (F) nuclear and cytoplasmic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was increased in both liver tissues from animals subjected to LPS/GalN- or GL+LPS/GaIN-treatment compared with baseline animals. the current data do not support the past working hypothesis that a decrease in nuclear or cytoplasmic HDAC activity due to LPS/GalN-treatment shifts the equilibrium of HMGB1 toward cytosolic accumulation. LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury might not be caused by extracellularly released HMGB1 via receptors such as TLR4/RAGE. real time PCR in mRNA levels of Tlr4 and Rage. administration of GL does not become responsive to mRNA levels of both the Tlr4 and Rage. inhibition of apoptotic cell death due to injection of GL. control (A), LPS/GalN-treatment (B) and GL+LPS/GalN-treatment (C) reduced number of TUNEL-labeled cells in pericentral areas. expression levels of Gsto1 and Cyp2d10 mRNAs decreased to 0.3920.017 and 0.3650.030. expression levels of Gsto1 and Cyp2d10 mRNAs were significantly recovered to 0.7610.111 and 0.8050.138, respectively, by administration of GL. levels of HMGB1 and Cyp2d10 mRNAs are significantly recovered by administration of GL. HMGB1 protein intensely binds to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-induced liver injury. d10 or Stc1 promoter sequence using this analysis. administration of GL remarkably inhibited binding of HMGB1 to promoter sequence. HMGB1 is involved in the apoptosis of hepatocytes caused by LPS/GalN-treatment. HMGB1 may be released through active secretion from various cells. HMGB1 produces an early inflammatory response [4], leading to amplification of HMGB1 secretion. this delayed active HMGB1 release may partly explain some of our findings. the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in maintaining and amplifying inflammation has been recently highlighted. soluble RAGE (sRAGE), the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE, suppresses injury in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion. GL-treatment did not exert any influence on its expression. HMGB1 binds DNA and regulates transcription [62], whreas outside the cell, it serves as a cytokine and mediates the late effects of LPS [2]. HMGB1 in monocytes and dendritic cells is extensively acetylated upon activation by LPS, causing localization of the protein to the cytosol. hepatitis remains to be unknown but is assumed to be implicated in signal pathways regulating apoptosis [66], [67]. administration of GL may inhibit acetylation of lysine in HMGB1 in the liver remnants of the LPS/GalN-induced mice. lysine residues of HMGB1 between 27 and 43 represent functional localizing signals in macrophages. recent mutation analysis for the abilities of HMGB1 protein to bind and bend DNA has reported the role of lysines 2 and 81 as target sites for acetylation in full-length HMGB1 and truncated tail-less protein. HMGB1 phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin protein kinase IV caused nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shuttling and release in LPS-stimulated macrophages. damaged cells activate innate immunity and recruit inflammatory cells by collectively releasing danger signals known as the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) hepatic injury stimulated by a single injection of LPS/GalN might not be caused by HMGB1 released into the extracellular milieu from non-hematopoietic cells (hepatocytes) or activated macrophages/dendritic cells. hepatocyte apoptosis promoted in the hepatic injury was prevented by administration of GL. tachione transferase are a superfamily of ubiquitous intracellular enzymes. they catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a wide range of exogenous and endogenous compounds, including chemical carcinogens. new members of the GST structural family with novel catalytic activities and functions have recently been discovered. gene microarray analysis shows expression patterns of 4 genes, Pdcd6, Gsto1, Cyp2d10, and Stc1, are influenced by injecting LPS/GaIN or LPS/GalN with GL. intravenous injection of HMGB1 (500 ng/mouse) does not stimulate ALT/AST activity compared with the control. immunohistochemical assessment of LPS/GalN-treatment on activation of NF-B in liver remnants at 0 (a), 3 (b), 6 (c), 8 (d) and 10 hours (e) after injury. at 3 h after LPS-treatment, the stronger nuclear immunoreaction is labeled compared with controls using an antibody against activated p65 (b), but its nuclear immunoreaction is gradually reduced in time-dependent manner (c,d)."}
