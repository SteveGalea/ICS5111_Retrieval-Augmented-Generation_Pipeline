{"summary": "between 70% and 90% of the human genome are estimated to be pervasively transcribed into mostly non-protein-coding RNAs. only 2% of the human genome are encoding for proteins. lncRNAs can execute a broad range of important functions in the cell. stic marker for patient survival in early stage lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. promotes cell motility of lung cancer cells31. supports proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells. the evolutionary conservation of MALAT1 over its entire length is depicted using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. MALAT1 expression was determined in a panel of 11 human cell lines representing different tissues of origin. on average, MALAT1 shows a 2.5-fold higher expression (p 0.001) in these cell lines compared with the abundant housekeeping gene RPLP0 (B, right panel). lncRNA MALAT1 was reduced only two-fold by shRNAs or siRNAs. genetic knockout models have only been established for very few lncRNAs. lncRNA Neat1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1) has been knocked out in mice. in human cells, MALAT1 showed a ubiquitous expression. it is detected in immortalized primary human cells (1\u00b0FF and HEK293) and in a broad range of cancer cell lines derived from different tissues. in addition, MALAT1 exceeded expression of classical housekeeping genes like RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, P0) two different qRT-PCR primer pairs located at either end of the MALAT1 transcript yielded the same negative results for MALAT1 expression in the knockout cell clones. we performed cell cycle analyses and proliferation assays with a panel of three MALAT1 wild-type (WT) control cell lines and three KO clones per cell line. relative proliferation rates were determined using a bromodeoxyuridine proliferation assay. results were normalized to the parental cell line in each case. a number of studies point to a crucial role of RNA as an architectural factor for shaping the genome and its nuclear environment. nucleolus is a site of active RNAP I transcription. the abundant MALAT1 transcript is found as an RNA component in purified nucleoli. the knockdown of MALAT1 by RNA interference resulted in a redistribution of growth-control gene promoters. the knockdown of MALAT1 by RNA interference resulted in a redistribution of growth-control gene promoters between PcG bodies and SC35 domains. HP1 was a factor involved in establishing and maintaining the repressive state of pericentric heterochromatin and telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) as a marker for the telomere shelterin complex. loss of MALAT1 had no detectable impact on the nuclear structures analyzed here. PCR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from single electroporated ES cell clones. a 2420 bp PCR fragment is absent in clones without correct targeting. sample 2 recognized a 4.1 kb XhoI/BamHI fragment in the correctly targeted locus. homozygous Malat1/ knockout mice, 21 heterozygous Malat1+/ knockout animals and 7 wild-type Malat1+/+ mice were obtained. malat1 expression was absent in all tissues obtained from homozygous Malat1 knockout mice. expression of lncRNA Neat1 was determined using two independent amplicons. data was normalized to expression in the wild-type cells. RN7SL1 served as reference gene. data was normalized to expression in wild-type cells. Thymic parenchyma is regularly divided into a cortical portion with densely packed lymphoid cells and a pale stained medullary portion. liver parenchyma displayed the characteristic lobular organization with hexagonal appearance based on the distributions of portal areas and central venules. MALAT1 was highly abundant and exceeded expression of classical housekeeping genes like for example RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, P0) this approach relies on the stable and site-specific integration of RNA destabilizing elements into the cancer cell genome mediated by zinc finger nucleases. two different qRT-PCR primer pairs located at either end of the MALAT1 transcript yielded the same negative results for MALAT1 expression in the knockout cell clones. a panel of three MALAT1 wild-type (WT) control cell lines and three KO clones per cell line performed cell cycle analyses and proliferation assays. results were normalized to the parental cell line in each case. the average percentages of cells in G1-, S- and G2/M-phase from at least two independent experiments are depicted. RNA was labeled via incorporated 5-ethynyl-uridine. the proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence. the nucleolus is a site of active RNAP I transcription. the knockdown of MALAT1 by RNA interference resulted in a redistribution of growth-control gene promoters between PcG bodies and SC35 domains. however, wild-type and knockout cells displayed no significant structural differences with respect to SC35 immunofluorescence. chromatin and telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) were used as a marker for the telomere shelterin complex. loss of MALAT1 had no detectable impact on the nuclear structures analyzed here. the complete 6,982 bp long Malat1 sequence was deleted. PCR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from single electroporated ES cell clones. the forward primer is located in the neo resistance gene. the reverse primer hybridizing to the wild-type sequence at the 3\u2032-end outside of the targeting construct. knockout animals and 7 wild-type Malat1+/+ mice were obtained. malat1 expression was absent in all tissues obtained from homozygous knockout mice. expression of the lncRNA Neat1 was determined using two independent amplicons. cell lines in parental cell line, two wild-type clones (WT) and three MALAT1 knockout clones (KO) each. data was normalized to expression in the wild-type cells. RN7SL1 served as reference gene. a cortical portion with densely packed lymphoid cells and a pale stained medullary portion showed a regular alveolar structure both in WT and Malat1 KO mice without any signs of edema, congestion or emphysema. no signs of fibrosis or inflammation were visible. this knockout approach is more effective and more specific than standard RNA interference techniques30,31 to deplete this highly abundant lncRNA. we have generated Malat1 knockout mice using homologous recombination in ES cells to study the physiological function of Malat1 in a whole mammalian organism. RNA interference-based knockdown using siRNA or shRNA constructs has its value in interrogating a gene for its function in vivo. but these approaches also need to be critically questioned for the efficiency and specificity of their knockdown. future studies will be essential to expose these mice to different stresses and environments. RNA isolation and DNase I digest RNA from cancer cell lines was isolated. samples were treated with the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C followed by a phenol:chloroform extraction and an ethanol precipitation at -80\u00b0C. 5 103 cells were seeded into black 96-well plates with a clear bottom (Greiner Bio-One) after 48 h, the BrdU solution (10 M f.c.) was added and the cells were incubated for 6 h. immunofluorescence, RNA staining via labeling of incorporated ethynyl uridine and staining of the DNA with 4',6-diamidin-2'-phenylindol-dihydrochlorid (DAPI) were conducted after para-Formaldheyde fixation as described previously. BAC clone RP24\u2013290K10 was electroporated into the recombination-competent E. coli strain SW106.48. the bacteria were transformed with the XhoI/Sal1 linearized pKoII vector. neo forward 5\u2032-TTCTGAGGGGGGATCAATTCTCTAGAACAGC-3\u2032 (located in the neo gene sequence) and wt reverse 5\u2032-CTCACCTGGAACCCTCTAGAACAGC-3\u2032 (located immediately downstream and outside of the targeting vector within the wildtype sequence) in case of correct homologous recombination of the targeting vector, a 2420 bp PCR fragment was amplified.
