{"summary": "each 75 mm 25 mm slide contained 24 subarrays, each containing the 330,000 peptides. the average length of each peptide was 11.2 amino acids with a standard deviation of 1.3. the longest peptide was 22 amino acids long, and the shortest was 1 amino acid. anti-human IgG-DyLight 549 (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to a final concentration of 5.0 nm to detect the human primary IgG. unbound secondary antibody was then removed by washing in incubation buffer followed by washing in distilled water (5 min each) Arrays were scanned at 533 nm using an Innoscan 910 array scanner (Innopsys, Carbonne, France) an additional control group of 32 different non-infected volunteers was collected from consenting individuals. the eight cohorts used in this study included 32 healthy (Normals), 9 dengue fever (DEN1 Flaviviridae), 8 Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferii), 7 syphilis (Treponema palladium), 13 malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), 12 whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis), 15 he the input to the algorithm is a set of sequences S = s1, s2,..., sn and associated preprocessed array intensity values Q = q1, q2,..., qn. the sequence AVHAD would be divided into the set AVH, VHA, HAD, AVHA, VHAD, AVHAD. a p value is computed for subsequence si according to pi = [kDI(median(t\u2032i) > k)|D|, where I is the indicator function. if 1000 subsequences are considered, is 1/1000, resulting in one expected false positive. individuals within the same disease cohort showed much more overlap between their significant subsequences than those in different cohorts or the normal cohort. the most common significant subsequences (query sequences) were searched against the pathogen proteome for 100% identity. sequences with set lengths were queried against two databases. one containing 596 human pathogens, and another containing over 5000 bacteria, viral, and eukaryotic proteomes. heptamer sequences are unlikely to appear in a given pathogen protein by chance. arrays were incubated for 1 h at 23 \u00b0C with rocking and then washed with incubation buffer plus 1% BSA. the arrays were then processed via incubation in the presence of antibodies or serum and detected by fluorescent antibody. monoclonal antibodies were used in this study: anti-human HA (Rockland Antibodies, Rockland, MD, [YPYDVPDYA]), DM1A (anti-human tubulin, Invitrogen/Invitrogen, [AALEKDYEEVGV]), Ab1 (anti-human TP53 antibodies, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, [TFRHSVVVV]), FLAG (invitrogen, Madison, eptide microarrays were made using in situ synthesis of 330,000 random-sequence peptides per 1-cm2 region. each 75 mm 25 mm slide contained 24 subarrays, each containing the 330,000 peptides. the average length of each peptide was 11.2 amino acids long, and the shortest was 1 amino acid. anti-human IgG-DyLight 549 (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to a final concentration of 5.0 nm to detect the human primary IgG. unbound secondary antibody was then removed by washing in incubation buffer followed by washing in distilled water (5 min each). Arrays were scanned at 533 nm using an Innoscan 910 array scanner (Innopsys, Carbonne, France). Array Construction Peptide microarrays were manufactured using in situ synthesis of 330,000 random-sequence peptides per each 1-cm2 region. each 75 mm 25 mm slide contained 24 subarrays, each containing the 330,000 peptides. the average length of each peptide was 11.2 amino acids with a standard deviation of 1.3, normally distributed. Array Residual N,N-dimethylformamide was removed by two 5-min washes in distilled water. Arrays were equilibrated in PBS for 30 min and blocked in the incubation buffer. incubation buffer was added to each well (100 l), and 100 l of 1:2500 diluted sera was added for a final concentration of 1:5000. Serum Samples Sera from seven different disease cohorts and 10 pools of healthy persons were provided by Seracare Life Sciences. eight cohorts used in this study included 32 healthy (Normals), 9 dengue fever (DEN1 Flaviviridae), 8 Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferii), 7 syphilis (Treponema palladium), 13 malaria. the controls for the monoclonal antibody study comprised the 32 healthy volunteers referred to as Normals. for each test, the top 500 peptides were used as seed sequences for epitope discovery. a subsequence is considered only if it appears in at least three peptides (ti > 3). the highest ranked subsequences have at least three appearances on the array and have high median intensities. this criterion is not strictly necessary, but it simplifies significance testing. the y-axis is categorical and shows each subsequence. the total number of samples in each cohort is given as a fraction at the top. subsequences with exact matches to proteins within the pathogen are indicated with vertical red bars. peaks of central subsequences were searched against a database of 596 proteomes from various strains of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protists. those proteins and organisms matching all queried sequences with 100% or 80% identity were noted. sequences with set lengths were drawn from this set and queried against two databases. the first step was to identify peptides that bind specifically to an epitope. arrays were normalized to the median intensity value to account for small differences in serum or dye concentrations. then, the fold-change was calculated per peptide across the sample of interest versus the median of control samples. we define the function Qsub as S\u2032 Qm, where m is the number of peptides excepting the top 500 seed peptides containing the input subsequence. a subsequence is considered only if it appears in at least three peptides (ti > 3). sequences that appeared most often in different individuals within the same group were deemed the most likely epitope candidates. a, the top 10 most commonly appearing and significant subsequences in serum samples from the indicated disease cohorts. n significant subsequences from the same cohort were pairwise aligned using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. this matrix was hierarchically clustered by single linkage, producing a dendrogram of related subsequences. peak sequences were searched against a database of 596 proteomes from various strains of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protists. algorithm used to find high binding subsequences was designed to find short consensus motifs within a large set of random peptides. seed sequences are computationally divided into all possible subsequences within a certain range of lengths (three to seven amino acids) all the subsequences in S constitute a new set, S\u2032. members in S\u2032 have one or more associated values in Q corresponding to the intensities from parent sequences containing that subsequence. this gives all intensity values associated with a subsequence. if 1000 subsequences are considered, is 1/1000, resulting in one expected false positive. in order to determine the most likely epitope candidates, we ranked sequences in terms of the number of subjects in which they were called significant. the most common significant subsequences (query sequences) were searched against the pathogen proteome for 100% identity. we assessed the probability of a match by searching randomly drawn array sequences of the same length as the query sequence against the proteome. significant subsequences were collected together into a FASTA-formatted list. multiple alignments were produced with ClustalW2 (26) a multiple-alignment text file was used as input to WebLogo3 (27) using default settings. monoclonal antibodies were used to test the motif search analysis algorithm. the highest rated subsequences were related to the true epitope and to each other to an extent that ensured the emergence of a conserved motif with strong association to the epitope sequence. the bar plots show the top binding subsequences (top panel) and subsequences (bottom panel) for each of the eight tested monoclonal antibodies. P53Ab1 (RHSVV), HA (DVPD), 4C1 (FDSH) and FLAG (DYDDDK) each had on-target motifs. these were enhanced through subsequence analysis. DM1A (ALEKDY) had few on-target motifs in its weblogos suggested positional dependence with dominating anchor residues and linking or non-anchor regions. weblogos suggested positional dependence with dominating anchor residues and linking or non-anchor regions. the black number is the average fold change of the peptides containing the indicated motif relative to the same peptides for all other monoclonal antibodies. p53Ab1 demonstrated high overall binding to the true epitope but cross-reacted with many other sequence clusters, preventing good prediction. gue was present in the database and indicated as an epitope from the NS1 protein in two dengue strains (E-value: 5 104) the sequence EDAK from Borrelia mapped to known antigen OspF (E-value: 4.6), and DYAFG from syphilis mapped to a lipoprotein in several strains of T. pallidum (E-value: 0.27). the plots suggest that when two 7-mer linear epitopes from the same protein antigen are known with at least 80% identity, unique pathogen identification is reliably predicted. the candidates map to antigenic proteins and are specific to the cohort of interest. epitope sequences revealed in groupwise analysis were present in most of the individuals from that group. all nine dengue samples contained AVHAD as a significant subsequence. peptides (features) common within a cohort demonstrated qualitatively greater fold-changes relative to Normals. the second 330,000-peptide library would have to be added to the first and 660,000 peptides would have to be exposed to the sera simultaneously. the motif on the left was present in a single dengue patient and maps to NS3 (34). three epitope candidates were queried against a database of 596 human pathogens for exact and 80% identity. only one protein from P. falciparum from all human pathogens contained both RLKEP and SNKQG. peptides with low similarity to the target created a lack of specificity in our datasets. however, transforming the data in terms of peptide subsequences revealed highly specific and consistent motifs that corresponded to epitope targets in five of the tested antibodies. receptor IgG1 4.5 1 827 No monoclonal antibodies were used to test the motif search analysis algorithm. the highest rated subsequences were related to the true epitope. the bar plots show the top binding subsequences (top panel) and subsequences (bottom panel) for each of the eight tested monoclonal antibodies. a very low percentage (11%) of binding peptides had strong sequence similarity with the true epitope. the five motifs were revealed after we incubated monoclonal antibodies on the peptide microarrays. top 25 sequence motifs found for monoclonal antibodies HA and p53. red outlined regions indicate the closest match to the actual epitope. black number is the average fold change of the peptides containing the indicated motif relative to the same peptides for all other monoclonal antibodies. five of the seven disease cohorts tested revealed a clear consensus sequence. the sequence AVHAD from dengue was present in the database and indicated as an epitope from the NS1 protein in two dengue strains (E-value: 5 104) further analysis of the other cohorts revealed additional matches to antigenic proteins. Plots show the distribution of hits to pairs of arbitrary sequences. pairs of k-mers with specified lengths were drawn at random. pair of k-mers with specified lengths were drawn at random from the distribution associated with array sequences. selection algorithm maximizes sensitivity and might not be a reliable estimate of performance. candidates map to antigenic proteins and are specific to the cohort of interest. the candidates do map to antigenic proteins and are specific to the cohort of interest. we then tried to find epitopes using a dengue-infected serum sample. this revealed an additional epitope (REGEK, Dengue 4, E-value: 8.3 104) that was previously mapped in the Immune Epitope Database but not present on the original array. this result suggests that larger arrays should reveal additional antibodies. a pair of pentamers, if known exactly, or a pair of heptamers, if known within 80% identity, is sufficient for resolving a pathogen in the Pathogen Proteome Database. we opted for a restrictive search, relying on exact or near-exact (80%) identity and matches in the same protein to multiple pentamer queries. the linear epitope for each monoclonal antibody was known. in most cases, simply sorting peptides by intensity per monoclonal antibody was insufficient to reveal epitope motifs among the highest binding peptides. however, transforming the data in terms of peptide subsequences revealed highly specific and consistent motifs. p53 IgG1 9.8 0 5074 Yes DYKDDDDK FLAG peptide IgG1 4 3.3 1167 Yes YPYDVPDYA HA peptide IgG1 3.6 0.9 905 Yes NAHYYVFFEEQE 2C11 Human insulin receptor IgG1 4.5 1 827 No monoclonal antibodies were used to test the motif search analysis algorithm. the highest rated subsequences were related to the true epi a very low percentage (11%) of binding peptides had strong sequence similarity with the true epitope. the five motifs were revealed after we incubated monoclonal antibodies on the peptide microarrays and performed subsequence analysis. antibodies showed varied binding profiles, with monoclonals such as HA, 4C1 and FLAG showing a narrow distribution around low intensities. a, top 25 sequence motifs found for monoclonal antibodies HA and p53 showed the closest match to the actual epitope. sequence AVHAD from dengue was present in the database and indicated as an epitope from the NS1 protein in two dengue strains (E-value: 5 104) the sequence EDAK from Borrelia mapped to known antigen OspF (E-value: 4.6), and DYAFG from syphilis mapped to a lipoprotein in several strains of T. pallidum (E-value: 0.27). the dengue sequences are unlikely to arise by chance, at least given the size of the initial peptide library. the two matches to the RESA protein in P. falciparum together had a low E-value of 0.072 corresponding to a p value of 0.067. selection algorithm maximizes sensitivity and might not be a reliable estimate of performance. candidates map to antigenic proteins and are specific to the cohort of interest. common within a cohort demonstrated qualitatively greater fold-changes relative to Normals than those with less common sequences within a cohort. we hypothesized that a different random library would result in additional targets that were invisible to the original experiments because they were not present. peptide microarrays are capable of resolving epitopes in a database of pathogen protein sequences. a pair of pentamers, if known exactly, or a pair of heptamers, if known within 80% identity, is sufficient for resolving a pathogen in the Pathogen Proteome Database. only one protein from P. falciparum contained both RLKEP and SNKQG. probability of two array 5-mers hitting the same protein by chance is 0.001. linear epitope for each monoclonal antibody was known.

Y map to known and characterized antigens in Borrelia burgdorferi and Plasmodium falciparum. the remainder displayed motif conservation consistent with epitopes. the remainder displayed motif conservation consistent with epitopes. the feature selection process for the seed peptides requires that antibodies be commonly expressed within a disease cohort. peptides (features) common within a cohort demonstrated qualitatively greater fold-changes relative to Normals than those with less common sequences within a cohort. peptide microarrays can predict eliciting protein from a database of pathogen protein sequences. a pair of pentamers, if known exactly, or a pair of heptamers, if known within 80% identity, is sufficient for resolving a pathogen in the Pathogen Proteome Database. pentamers matching to one or more proteins globally in this database of over 1 million sequences is 0.01. sample specific significant subsequences from the malaria cohort were combined, aligned, and hierarchically clustered by single linkage. this revealed three distinct epitope candidates, indicated by red asterisks. five monoclonal antibodies (HA, DM1A, 4C1, Ab1 and FLAG) bound only peptides that were related to their targets. HA, 4C1, FLAG, and DM1A allowed substitutions in certain positions to varying degrees depending on the sample. differences in apparent binding might reflect true variation in antibody cross-reactivity characteristics. the size of the sequence space increases exponentially with the number of residues. substitutions may allow recognition of future variants of a pathogen to which the host was once exposed. previously, we attempted epitope mapping on smaller arrays with 10,000 peptides. a further sequence (DAFEY) was found in six samples and mapped to a PfEMP1 protein. expression of these proteins is dynamic so as to evade the host immune response. it is likely that more antibodies against this family would be found in a larger study. the arrays contained 27% of possible pentamers in triplicate. in both monoclonal and serum samples, success rates were much higher. a typical BLAST search of a pentamer is likely to be dominated by spurious and insignificant results. epitope candidate pentamers gleaned from the arrays were much more likely to match pathogenic protein sequences than randomly drawn array pentamers. this indicates that epitopes are actually much less diverse than random or even life-space sequences. this suggests some design principles should be applied when designing a \u201crandom\u201d peptide library."}
