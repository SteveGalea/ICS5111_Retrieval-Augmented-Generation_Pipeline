{"summary": "in the affected patients, a novel swine origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) with molecular features of north american and eurasian swine, avian, and human influenza viruses were isolated 2. it has spread very rapidly since the first cases were diagnosed in Mexico with the subsequent spread of the virus throughout Europe during the winter season. the patients were admitted to hospital and critical care units according to this case report form. data were collected retrospectively on all patients who had influenza A 2009 related critical illness from November 1 2009 to December 15 2009. intubation and mechanical ventilation requirements, adverse events during ICU stay were also recorded. 61 critically ill patients were admitted to three different critical care units in turkey due to confirmed or suspected influenza A 2009 (H1N1) infection. in 45 patients, diagnosis was confirmed by real-time diagnosis. in 16 patients, diagnosis was suspected according to CDC and WHO criteria 8, 9. Average age was 41.52 15.7 years and 54 % were female (female: 33, male: 28) Mortality rate was 50.8 % (31 patients) clinical characteristics of patients with influenza A virus were shown in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. 316.9 Serum creatininin (mg/dL) 1.61.8 AST (U/L) 96.8145.3 ALT (U/L) 45.670 Platelets count (per mm3) 188.8108.4 Opacity on initial chest X-ray, n (%) Normal chest X-ray 2 (3.2%) Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray 55 (90.1%) 1/4 quadrants infiltrates on chest X- ns Female sex, n (%) 20 (66.6) 13 (41.9) ns Comorbidities, n (%) 26 (86.6) 24 (77.4) ns BMI 28.15.3 27.48.5 ns Obesity, n (%) 10 (33.3) 7 (22.6) ns APACHE II score 16.55.4 20.96.5 0.007 PaO2 / FiO2 (mmHg) 136.675.7 120.165.6 in, mg/dL 0.850.90 1.060.97 ns Creatinin kinase, U/L 314.0372.9 527.8644.1 ns NIMV: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation Symptoms at presentation included fever (88.5 %), cough (83.6 %), sputum (79 %) and dyspnea (96.7%) eighteen patients (24.6 %) had elevated creatinine levels. on admission, 11 of 61 patients had leukopenia, 27 of 61 (42.2 %) had anemia. 12 of 61 patients had positive blood and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures. patients with viral primary pneumonia had bilateral patchy alveolar opacities. all patients had a mean oxygen saturation of 65% (range, 45 to 80) after supplementary oxygen, all patients had a mean oxygen saturation of 83.7 %. APACHE II score, PCO2, white blood cell count and neutrophil account were higher in invasive mechanical ventilation group than NIMV group. patients who survived were more likely to have NIMV use at the time of admission to the ICU. within 30 days, 51% of critically ill patients had died. a history of lung diseases, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, neurological diseases, malignancy, and heart diseases were the most common comorbidities. a general female susceptibility has been observed in other influenza case series of variable severity including reports of H1N1 infections 18, 19. death was higher in males than females. males represent a larger proportion of cases and have a higher mortality 20, 21. invasive ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients with swine flu associated respiratory failure. invasive ventilation was used in 68.8% of critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) on admission ICU. 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related critical illness predominantly affects young patients with little major comorbidity. NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure."}
