{"summary": "the most common viral entero-pathogens are canine parvovirus (CPV) [1] and coronavirus (CCoV) [2], [3], although other agents, such as canine adenovirus (CAdV) type 1 [4], canine distemper virus (CDV) [5], rotaviruses [6], reoviruses [7], and caliciviruses [8] have been associated with enteric disease in dogs dogCV possesses an ambisense genomic organization with 2 major inversely arranged ORFs encoding for the replicase and capsid proteins. the canine virus, firstly detected in serum samples, was later recognized as causative agent of necrotizing vasculitis and granulomatous lymphadenitis [13]. tis and haemorrhagic enteritis with involvement of the mesenteric lymph nodes that appeared congested and haemorrhagic. samples from the liver and intestine of the dog were collected and homogenized in 1 ml viral transport medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) standardized procedures were carried out for in vitro isolation of bacteria commonly associated with enteritis. samples were plated out on 5% sheep blood agar and cultured aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h for detection of aerobic pathogens. the liver and intestine were homogenized in D-MEM (10% weight/volume) 500 l of the homogenates were used to infect about 1 million cells. the cells were grown in D-MEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) glucosamine has been reported to enhance replication of PCV. a total of 30 l of the RCA product was digested with ApaI. the 2 kb-long insert of the plasmid was ligated with the ApaI-restricted vector pBluescript II SK(+) and transformed into XL-1 Blue MRF' Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) t sequences of the replicase and capsid protein genes were elaborated using neighbor-joining and parsimony methods. the distantly-related Gyrovirus Chicken anemia virus (M55918) was used as outgroup. the dog owner gave his written consent for necropsy and sample collection. the six 5\u20136-months old animals had completed the first-year vaccination protocol against CPV, CDV, CAdVs and Leptospira spp. clinical signs were severe, with hemorrhagic diarrhoea, vomiting and death of 2 animals after one week of illness. the nucleic acid templates were stored at \u201370\u00b0C until use. the samples were considered positive if amplicons were visualized after gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. real-time PCR was performed on a 7500 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA) with iTaq Supermix added with ROX (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl, Milan, Italy) the reaction mixture contained 12,5 l of iTaq Supermix, primers DogCV-forward and DogCV-reverse [13] at a concentration of 600 nmol l1, probe DogCV-probe [13] at a infected cells were sub-cultured every 6\u20138 days for 5 consecutive passages. a rolling circle amplification protocol was performed using the TempliPhi 100 amplification kit (Amersham Biosciences) b-long insert of the plasmid was sequenced using the universal primers M13 forward and M13 reverse (Invitrogen) at the BaseClear B.V. (Leiden, The Netherlands) a consensus sequence was generated using three clones. the genome sequence of the dogCV was assembled and analysed using the Genious software package. strain 4\u20131131 (DQ146997), Starling circovirus (StCV) (DQ17290), Gull circovirus (GuCV) (DQ845074), Finch circovirus (FiCV) (DQ845075), Cygnus olor circovirus (SwCV) (EU056310), Barbel circovirus (Barbel CV) (GU799606), Cyclovirus (Cy) NG13 ( the viral genome of strain Bari/411\u201313 contained two intergenic noncoding regions (203 and 135 nt in length) similar to other animal circoviruses, the genome of strain bari/411\u201313 contained two intergenic noncoding regions (203 and 135 nt in length) the origin of replication site for strain bari/411\u201313 was predicted to consist of a palindromic sequence that includes dodecanucleotide pairs in the stem, whereas the loop is the replicase protein was 303-aa long and contained several aa motifs that are highly conserved among circoviruses. there were 36 changes in the replicase of DogCVs, and 6 changes were unique to the Italian circovirus. the capsid protein, 270 aa in length, displayed at the N terminus a 30-aa-strectch rich in arginine residues. the highest identity was observed to strain UCD2 (98.0% nt), while identity to strain UCD3 was lower (85.6% nt) phylogeny was initially inferred using the full-length genome of strain Bari/411\u201313 and of reference CVs. the genome of the Italian DogCV prototype strain Bari/411\u201313 was of 2,063 nt in length, like all other DogCVs. the genome of strain bari/411\u201313 was of 2,063 nt in length, with only exception of strain 214, that is 2-nt shorter. PCVs have a genome length of 1,955 nt. the origin of replication site for strain Bari/411\u201313 was predicted to consist of a palindromic sequence that includes dodecanucleotide pairs in the stem. the loop is formed by the decanucleotide motif CATAGTATTA. a 150-nt stretch within the 3\u2032-intergenic sequence showed 91% nt identity against a torque teno virus recently detected in wild pine marten (Martes martes) the replicase protein was 303-aa long and contained several aa motifs that are highly conserved among circoviruses. there were 36 changes in the replicase of DogCVs, and 6 changes were unique to the Italian circovirus. there were 25 aa changes among DogCVs in the capsid protein. the highest identity was observed to strain UCD2 (98.0% nt), while identity to strain UCD3 was lower (85.6% nt) phylogeny was initially inferred using the full-length genome of strain Bari/411\u201313. analysis of archival samples has revealed that this novel virus has been circulating in dogs for at least 5 years before being discovered. a number of novel circoviruses have been detected in recent years, including human and animal viruses that have been proposed to form the new genus. the present report could clarify better the pathogenic potential of DogCV. if further studies are needed to assess the pathogenic and epidemiological features of this novel canine agent."}
