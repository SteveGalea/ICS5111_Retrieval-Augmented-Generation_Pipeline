{"summary": "intestine tissues and serum samples were taken from 56 animals. a total of 41 civet farms were in the province at the time of the slaughter campaign. no biosecurity measures were used in farms or markets, and no veterinary examination or accreditation was required. er virus neutralization test (er virus neutralization test) used in both VNT and IFA. plaque purified three times in vero cells, and stock virus (titer 5 x 107 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50] prepared by two low-multiplicity passes in vero cells. of 103 civet serum samples tested, 18 were positive on at least one of the three assays used, for 17% overall seroprevalence. the prevalence on each farm was 40% (4 of 10 animals from the farm in Shanwei tested positive; no positive animals were found on the other farms) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 bTiter of antibody that neutralized infectivity of 200 50% tissue culture infective dose of SARS-CoV. dWestern blot was conducted by using a serum dilution of 1:50. the intensity of staining in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells was indicated by the sign +, with +++ representing the strongest signal observed. civet selection was derived from a convenience sample and limited because of time constraints imposed by the slaughter campaign. animals selected from one market in Guangzhou in January 2004 had a much higher prevalence of SARS-CoV antibodies than those selected from farms in the same period or from two other provinces in June 2003. we observed a high percentage of infected civets in one particular market at a specific time. however, no indication of civet infection was seen on most farms during the same period. these results support the hypothesis that civets are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV, perhaps especially when stressed. at least one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and one ferret-badger (Melogale moschata) from the same market at the same time. one civet isolate (SZ16) was more closely related to the raccoon dog isolate (SZ13) than the other two civet isolates (SZ1 and SZ3), which further supports interspecies transmission in the market. myelitis virus) and group 3 (infectious bronchitis virus) found no cross-reactivity. we cannot rule out the possibility that an unknown coronavirus can infect civets. this may give low levels of cross-reactivity in the assays used in this study. however, such cross-reactive antibodies are not likely to positively react in all three of the assays used in this study."}
