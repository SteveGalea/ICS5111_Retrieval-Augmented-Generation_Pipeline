{"summary": "the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) is the major proton pump responsible for acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. the enzyme consists of two multi-subunit complexes, the soluble V1 subcomplex catalyzing ATP hydrolysis and the transmembrane Vo subcomplex required for the proton transport across membranes. the function of v-ATPases is essential for cellular processes such archazolids are natural compounds of high interest that can be used both as a tool to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition. they can be either produced by fermentation [11] or by total synthesis [13,14]. archazolid activated pathways of cellular stress response and apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells. the inhibition of v-ATPase by concanamycin prevented proliferation, reduced migration and impaired angiogenesis-related signaling in endothelial cells. a link between the function of v-ATPases and the adhesion and transmigration properties of endothelial cells. both types of endothelial cells were cultivated in collagen G-coated flasks or seeded into collagen G-coated cells. human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (ACC-732) and prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (ACC-465) were obtained from the leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) all cell types were cultivated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the assay is based on the ability of metabolically active cells to reduce resazurin. 1 g/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was used to visualize the nuclei. 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 was used to visualize the acidic compartments which correspond to the lysosomes. both dyes were incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C before acquisition of single images. treated HUVECs, MDA-MB-231 or PC-3 cells were washed once with DMEM. for blocking the integrin 1 subunit on HUVECs, cells were incubated with the anti-integrin 1 antibody (0.1 g/well in ECGM) transmigration was quantified by measuring fluorescence signal at 485 nm (excitation) and 535 nm (emission) the cells were induced to upregulate the gene expression of cell adhesion molecules by TNF. the threshold cycle of the target gene was normalized to the threshold cycle of the target gene. Flow cytometry HUVECs were grown to confluence on 12-well plates before they were treated with archazolid for 24 h. cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences, Hirschberg an der Bergstra\u00dfe, Germany) in PBS for 10 min and washed once with PBS before incubating with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) immunofluorescence staining of viable cells On ice, cells were incubated with an anti-human collagen antibody (rabbit, 1:40, ab36064, Abcam) on ice for 30 min. the staining procedure was performed to ensure that surface proteins or antibodies are not endocytosed. cathepsin B activity assay performed as described in the publication by Kubisch et al. transfection of HUVECs The HUVEC Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, K\u00f6ln, Germany) was used to transfect HUVECs. the transfection was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the cells were treated for further experiments. archazolid A was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) stocks of 10 mM archazolid were stored at -80\u00b0C. for the treatment of cells archazolid was diluted in culture medium with a maximum concentration of 0.01% DMSO. the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (ACC-732) and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (ACC-465) were obtained from the leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) both cell types were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/l glucose (PAN-Biotech) supplemented with 10% FCS, LDH catalyzes the enzymatic conversion of lactate to pyruvate. it provides NADH for the conversion of iodonitrotetrazolium violet into a red formazan product in the presence of diaphorase. cell adhesion was determined by fluorescence measurements with an Infinite F200 pro microplate reader (Tecan) at 485 nm (excitation) and 535 nm (emission) cellTracker Green-labeled MDA-MB-231 or PC-3 cells were incubated with an anti-integrin 1 antibody (P5D2, ab24693, abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for blocking the integrin 1 subunit on MDA-MB-231 or PC-3 untreated MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye (as described in the section cell adhesion assay) and resuspended in medium 199 (PAN-Biotech) containing 0.1% BSA. ICAM-1 (forward 5\u2019-CTG CTC GGG GCT CTG TTC-3\u2019), VCAM-1 (forward 5\u2019-CCA CAG TAA GGC AGG TCA CA-3\u2019), E-selectin (forward 5\u2019-AGA TGA GGA ACA GGT CAT GGT CA-3\u2019), N-cadherin (forward 5\u2019-CAG GAA AAG TGG CAA GTG GC-3\u2019), and GAPDH (forward 5\u2019- antibodies phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-human CD106 (mouse, VCAM-1), PE-labeled anti-human CD62E (mouse, E-selectin) and PE-labeled anti-human CD325 (mouse, N-cadherin) were diluted in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. surface expression of cell adhesion molecules was measured by flow cytometry. oride, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, -glycerophosphate, sodium pyrophosphate and H2O2 were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membranes were blocked with 5% bolting-grade milk powder (Carl Roth) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. fluorescence was measured at 348 nm (excitation) and 440 nm (emission) for background subtraction the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me (Enzo Life Sciences, L\u00f6rrach, Germany) was added to an additional reaction. hCathepsin B was digested with PmeI and XbaI. pcDNA3.1 (-) delta MCS used for transfections was cloned on the basis of hCathepsin B and is therefore lacking almost the whole part of the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3.1 (-) one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test or unpaired t-test was used. the integrity of the endothelial monolayer was not affected by archazolid. the cells showed a slightly different morphology. archazolid alter the cell morphology and is functionally active in HUVECs. cells were treated with 1 nM archazolid before they were incubated with LysoTracker Red DND-99 and Hoechst 33342. v-ATPase inhibition by archazolid increases the adhesion of tumor cells onto endothelial cells. untreated cells were treated with archazolid (arch) or DMSO (co) for 24 h. the cells were allowed to adhere for 10 min and 120 min. non-adherent MDA-MB-231 cells were washed off. adhesion of non-metastatic Jurkat cells remained unaffected. archazolid treatment augmented adhesive properties of both micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells for metastatic tumor cells. v-ATPase inhibition in HUVECs did not alter the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. archazolid does not upregulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in HUVECs. 1-integrins on tumor cells mediate the archazolid-induced cell adhesion. the integrin 1-subunit was blocked either on MDA-MB-231 cells, PC-3 cells or on HUVECs. blocking integrin 1 subunits on MDA-MB-231 or PC-3 cells prevents archazolid-mediated increase in tumor cell adhesion. cell adhesion assay performed after integrin 1 subunit was blocked by monoclonal antibody for 30 min on either MDA-MB-231 cells (n = 6) or HUVECs (n = 3) archazolid treatment of endothelial cells may lead to upregulation of collagen. a cell adhesion assay was performed with untreated MDA-MB-231 or PC-3 cells (co) and M. DA-MB-231 or PC-3 cells were treated with 1 nM archazolid (arch) or DMSO (co) for 24 h. surface collagen was detected by immunofluorescence staining of viable cells and nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining. cathepsin B is a lysosomal enzyme that degrades extracellular matrix components including collagen [37\u201341] as collagen is degraded by cathepsin B and the activation of cathepsin B depends on v-ATPase activity [28,36\u201338,42] western blot analysis of mature cathepsin B was performed. the level of cathepsin B after transfection was assessed by western blot analysis. the level of cathepsin B after transfection was assessed by western blot analysis. v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid has never been used for studies in endothelial cells. we treated confluent HUVECs with up to 1 nM archazolid for 24 and 48 h. this treatment has neither an influence on the metabolic activity nor on the release of LDH after 24 h. archazolid alter the cell morphology and is functionally active in HUVECs. cells were treated with 1 nM archazolid (arch) or DMSO (co). microscopic images of viable cells were taken. untreated MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 1 nM archazolid for 24 h. untreated MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with cellTracker Green CMFDA Dye. v-ATPase inhibition strongly increased the attachment of the metastatic breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 onto HUVECs. unlabeled HUVECs and CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were allowed to transmigrate through the endothelial monolayer for 24 h. transmigrated cells were quantified by measuring the fluorescence signal. v-ATPase inhibition by archazolid increases the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells onto HMEC-1 and the adhesion of PC-3 cells onto HUVECs. untreated cells were stained with CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye and added to an HMEC-1 monolayer. archazolid does not upregulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules in HUVECs. the surface expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin was analyzed by flow cytometry. 1-integrins on tumor cells mediate the archazolid-induced cell adhesion. integrins on tumor cells mediate the archazolid-induced cell adhesion. integrins can mediate the process of cell adhesion. the cell adhesion assay was performed after the integrin 1 subunit was blocked by a monoclonal antibody for 30 min on either MDA-MB-231 cells (n = 6) or HUVECs (n = 3). PC-3 cells were allowed to adhere for 60 min. blocking of the integrin 1 subunit on MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells abolished the interaction with collagen. Fig 7 shows that the attachment of these tumor cells to collagen is mediated by 1-integrins. a representative image out of three independently performed experiments is shown. the increase in extracellular collagen was quantified. data are expressed as mean SEM (n = 3) western blot analysis showed that archazolid reduces the activity and expression of cathepsin B in endothelial cells. the activity of cathepsin B was strongly decreased by approximately 50% compared to control cells at an archazolid concentration of 1 nM. overexpression of cathepsin B in endothelial cells attenuates both the basal and archazolid-induced adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells. the adhesion was quantified by measuring the fluorescence signal using a plate reader. archazolid-induced tumor cell adhesion was mediated by 1-integrins expressed on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. adhesion of non-metastatic Jurkat cells was largely independent from extracellular matrix proteins. jurkat cells express 41-integrins but lack 21-, 31-integrins [44] Jurkat cells interact with human endothelial cells that express VCAM-1 after cytokine treatment. 21- and 31-integrins expressing MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells were not able to adhere [44] and might preferentially interact with cell adhesion molecules rather than with ECM proteins. v-ATPase inhibition impairs cathepsin B activity in endothelial cells. v-ATPase inhibition impaired cathepsin B activity in endothelial cells. archazolid-induced decrease in cathepsin B activity and expression. the adhesion of Jurkat cells is mostly independent from the ECM proteins collagen, fibronectin or laminin. archazolid-induced MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion onto the endothelium resulted in a decrease in transendothelial migration. v-ATPase plays an important role in regulating the adhesion of cells expressing receptors for extracellular matrix components. archazolid represents a promising tool to elucidate the role of v-ATPase in endothelial cells. after 60 min of incubation, non-adherent cells were washed off. data are expressed as mean SEM (n = 5)"}
