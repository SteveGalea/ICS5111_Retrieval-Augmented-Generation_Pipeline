{"summary": "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses (flu), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinoviruses (RV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (Ad) and human coronavirus (hCoV) common to these viruses are their ability to infect airway epithelial cells, co-opt host cell proteins to facilitate infection, modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. a novel class of antiviral cytokines was discovered and classified as type III IFNs. these cells express patterns of Th1- and Th-2 type cytokines and chemokines. this response occurs very early, i.e. before the expression of viral proteins. mouse and some human studies have revealed that RSV protein governance of the host cell response is associated with let-7 microRNA (miRNA) expression mediated by the central conserved region in the G protein (33) mouse and some human studies have revealed that RSV proteins modulate many aspects of the immune response to infection, particularly the RSV G protein (7). anti-RSV G protein antibody responses are associated with inhibition of rSV G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction and RSV G protein-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis. this suggests a vaccination strategy to target antibodies against the G protein could be efficacious. this is a feature true for influenza as well (45). airway epithelium has a central role in defense against respiratory virus infections by expression of antiviral and immune signals mechanisms that contribute to viral resistance and clearance. however, respiratory viruses have evolved strategies to subvert the defense mechanisms leading to cytopathogenesis, increased inflammatory responses, and disease."}
