{"summary": "a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system is lacking due to limited resources. we developed a simplified ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation for use by public emergency medical services. ECMO without mechanical ventilation has been used in ARDS patients. the system was specifically designed to address the medical circumstances in south Korea and can be appropriately applied to other hospitals in south Korea. piratory pressure >10 cm H2O and FiO2 >0.6) despite optimal conventional therapy Untreatable metastatic cancer Respiratory failure requiring lung transplantation Inability to maintain adequate saturation of peripheral O2 with maximum O2 supply by bag-valve mask alone. the most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA) the most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral vein and left femoral artery. ator settings were gradually lowered over 1 hour to maintain a partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) >70 mm Hg, partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) 50 mm Hg, and a saturation of peripheral O2 (SpO2) >95% at a fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.4, PEEP of 5 mm Hg, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths transport was implemented only after 2 or more intensive care specialists and thoracic surgeons verified the indications for ECMO. we devised a short-distance transport program for patients in Busan and south Gyeongsang province. the transport range was determined as the area where interhospital transport was feasible within 4 hours, the duration of capacity for the electrical power supply of available ambulances and the loading capacity of O2 tanks. the team consisted of specialists capable of solving mechanical problems pertinent to ECMO, as well as treating episodes of cardiac arrest that can occur during emergency transport. the most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) the most commonly used cannulas were the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA) the patient\u2019s arterial blood pressure, SpO2, and heart rate were monitored with a portable vital sign monitor. the patient\u2019s status was observed constantly by monitoring vital signs and by visually verifying the blood color in the inflow and outflow lines. the patient\u2019s status was observed by monitoring vital signs and by visually verifying the blood color in the inflow and outflow lines. we devised a short-distance transport program for patients in busan and south Gyeongsang province. the transport range was determined as the area where interhospital transport was feasible within 4 hours, the duration of capacity for the electrical power supply of available ambulances and the loading capacity of O2 tanks. the team consisted of specialists capable of solving mechanical problems pertinent to ECMO, as well as treating episodes of cardiac arrest. the most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA) the most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral vein and left femoral artery. ventilator settings were gradually lowered over 1 hour to maintain a partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) >70 mm Hg, partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) 50 mm Hg, and a saturation of peripheral O2 (SpO2) >95% at a fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.4, PEEP of 5 mm Hg, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breath the patient was transported to the ICU in the same manner as during the departure. the patient continued to be monitored for hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory or metabolic acidosis. 18 patients were accommodated with our ECMO transport system.

ECMO transport with Ambu-bag ventilation has been feasible in patients with respiratory failure. if a mechanical ventilator was required during transport, it would be necessary to include more O2 tanks in the transport vehicle. the space required for the additional O2 tanks would interfere with the activities and number of specialists riding aboard the ambulance."}
