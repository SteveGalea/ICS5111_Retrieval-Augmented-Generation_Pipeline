{"summary": "a range of RNA structure prediction software and relevant resources are available, but most are underutilized by virologists. the roles of RNA elements in viral biology is illustrated using well-studied viruses, flaviviruses, influenza, and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) this RNA structural conservation is based on the concept that RNA stems can be conserved regardless of the base-pairs used. both of these features can form the basis of predicting new RNA elements. predicted bulges may use non-canonical base-pairs e.g., U-U, A-G, kink-turn. the GNRA loop is most common, where N represents any base. RNAComposer, 3dRNA. Widespread but most software will not predict these due to non-canonical base-pairs. mfold/UNAFold, RNAfold, RNAStructure/Fold. Common in 3D structures. only two specialized tools available to date\u2014CovaRNA and LRIscan. only LRIscan is optimized for viral genomes and yet to be proven useful. pair Catalog are U-U (about 10% as frequent as A-U pairs) and A-G (about 2% as frequent as C-G, 191 of 9,316; Stombaugh et al., 2009). for example, the base-triple in retroviral encapsidation signals (D'souza et al., 2004) and the base-triples in the pseudoknots of beet western yellows virus (Su et al., 1999 phenotype may be restored by compensatory base-pairing changes. primary sequence motifs and structures of loops and bulges may also have important roles. stem-loop diagram is not suitable to represent higher order interactions such as pseudoknotted interactions. Stockholm format is commonly used to represent the consensus RNA secondary structure of aligned sequences. R2R uses Stockholm file as the input to generate a novel stem-loop diagram of the consensus RNA secondary structure of aligned sequences. most cited RNA software in virology papers was first released as a command line software in the late 1980s. a new generation of software such as LoCARNA (Smith et al., 2010) and RNAz (Gruber et al., 2007) work on multiple sequences. different methods vary in whether they align or fold first or do both simultaneously. webservers predict RNA 2D and 3D structures with high confidence. current methods often provide a 2D and oversimplified view of a certain sequence forming a single RNA structure. this is incorrect particularly in viral RNAs, where structures need to be transiently formed and melted. stems can be conserved regardless of the base-pairs used. mFE suboptimal predictions are particularly useful in assessing possible alternative structures of RNA and long-distance base-pairs. predicted internal loops may use non-canonical base-pairs e.g., U-U, A-G. Tetraloop. a four-base terminal loop stabilizes the stem-loop structure. RNAComposer, 3dRNA. Common in 3D structures. Kissing hairpins/kissing loops/kissing stem-loops. in viruses pseudoknots are often located nearby. only two specialized tools available to date\u2014CovaRNA and LRIscan. Known viral RNA structures, from stem-loops to complex tRNA-like structures. about 40% of bases in known crystal and solution structures were either unpaired, or form non-canonical interactions. RNA 3D structures can also be predicted directly from sequences. a wild type phenotype can be destroyed with mutations that disrupt the RNA structure. stem-loop diagram is not suitable to represent higher order interactions such as pseudoknotted interactions. diagrams can be generated using VARNA, which requires dot-bracket notation as the input. Stockholm format is commonly used to represent the consensus RNA secondary structure of aligned sequences. R2R uses Stockholm file as the input to generate a novel stem-loop diagram of the consensus RNA secondary structure. a new generation of software such as LoCARNA (Smith et al., 2010) and RNAz (Gruber et al., 2007) work on multiple sequences. this alleviates the need of predicting RNA structures from related virus sequences one at a time. current methods often provide a 2D and oversimplified view of a certain sequence forming a single RNA structure. this is incorrect particularly in viral RNAs, where structures need to be transiently formed and melted. this one-to-one sequence and structure relationship is also not true in many RNA viruses because they may exist in a quasispecies state where sequence space is sampled by high levels of replication error. a similarity search on the NCBI/RefSeq database may not only allow identification of the virus, but also identify related viral sequences that could assist in predicting functional elements. deep and accurate multiple sequence alignment is crucial in predicting likely RNA structures. ICTV and ViralZone are discussed in the next section. potential coding sequences (CDS) can be predicted in at least the three forward reading frames. similar sequences may be found with blastn, although non-coding similarity may be missed. alignments for detection of elements within CDS can be facilitated by searching with the encoded protein (e.g., tblastn and tblastx) this will give greater sensitivity than blastn searches. RNA structures can also be detected in unaligned sequences, although these methods are more computationally intensive. RNA structures located near the 3\u2032 end of HCV are often important in nuclear export of viral RNAs. other elements e.g., cis-acting replication elements (CRE) can be found in various genomic locations. as of June 2017, it documents the biology of 110 viral families. the ICTV master species list (2016 v1.3) has the taxonomic classification of 4404 viruses and viroids, 44% of these are RNA viruses. over half (58%) of the RNA viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. RNA viruses are often enriched with RNA structures. only two RNA virus families infect bacteria, Leviviridae and Cystoviridae. they are positive-sense single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA viruses. 99% of bacterial and archaeal viruses (bacteriophages) are DNA viruses. the database of RNA structure families contains over 105 viral RNA structural elements from both DNA and RNA viruses. the most common viral RNA elements in Rfam are those in 3\u2032UTRs (e.g., CITEs), 5\u2032UTR (e.g., IRES), and packaging elements. experimentally determined three dimensional RNA structures and descriptors of common structural elements (e.g., kink-turns, Table 1) are found in the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) and related databases (Coimbatore Narayanan et al., 2016). these elements can be automatically included in homology based 3D predictions. overlapping CDS may indicate frameshifts which would then direct the search to specific primary features, and nearby stem-loops or pseudoknots. other elements e.g., cis-acting replication elements (CRE) can be found in various genomic locations. the ICTV master species list has the taxonomic classification of 4404 viruses and viroids. over half (58%) of the RNA viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. eukaryotic RNA viruses occur in the cytoplasm, which are distinct from the host system. only two RNA virus families are bacteriophages, Leviviridae and Cystoviridae. 99% of bacterial and archaeal viruses (bacteriophages) are DNA viruses. the properties of MS2 have been exploited for various novel applications such as pull-down, tethering proteins to RNAs, RNA affinity purification, and live cell imaging of RNAs. the most common viral RNA elements in Rfam are those in 3\u2032UTRs (e.g., CITEs), 5\u2032UTR (e.g., IRES), and packaging elements. characterized researchers can submit new RNA families to Rfam. automated resources and guides for building families are available. RNA structures and descriptors of common structural elements can be automatically included in homology based 3D predictions. RNA structures in the 3\u2032UTRs of flaviviruses Flaviviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, e.g., the mosquito-borne Dengue and Zika viruses. the sequences and RNA structures of flaviviruses have been studied over three decades. utski et al. found many covarying base-pairs in these structures. there are 10 statistically significant covarying base-pairs in flavivirus dumbbell structures (RF00525; Figures 2E,F) currently annotated in Rfam. sfRNAs protect flaviviral subgenomic RNAs from the host Xrn1 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease digestion. these sfRNAs are pathogenic and important in regulating viral life cycle. codon-based alignments detect synonymous constraints, possibly due to the presence of structured RNA elements. this is based on the assumption that synonymous substitutions in a CDS are restricted by base-pairing required for RNA folding. d experimentally and/or found to be important for the virus viability. subsequent studies focused on specific genes/genome segments. HA (surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin; Gultyaev et al., 2016), M (Kobayashi et al., 2016), and NP (nucleoprotein; Gultyaev et al., 2016) the type member BYDV-PAV has a 5.7 kb positive stranded RNA genome. it has a 5.7 kb positive stranded RNA genome, and three coding and non-coding subgenomic RNAs. it is likely that it would have required multiple non-canonical translation events to make key proteins. the sequences and RNA structures of the 3\u2032UTRs of flaviviruses have been studied over three decades. previous studies found that the 3\u2032UTR sequences of flaviviruses are highly divergent immediately after the stop codon, but remarkably similar at the distal region of the 3\u2032UTR. structures of flavivirus 3\u2032UTRs were recently refined and proposed as H-type pseudoknots (tertiary structures) the structures of these flavivirus RNA elements were recently validated by SHAPE (Selective 2\u2032-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) chemical probing, mutation analysis and X-ray crystallography. RNA structures in coding regions of influenza A virus Influenza A virus. it is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has an eight-segment genome. this enabled them to discover many putative structured RNA elements located in the CDS of Influenza A virus. significant synonymous constraint sites of aligned CDS can be detected using FRESco (Sealfon et al., 2015) or synplot2 (Firth, 2014) many automated alignments of viral genomes are available using codon based alignments in searches for conserved RNA structures or overlapping CDS. Kobayashi et al. (2016) analyzed 1884 sequences of M gene from 88 Influenza A virus subtypes. they scanned the deeply aligned CDS for potential RNA structured regions and synonymous variations using SSE. predicted RNA structures on the regions with both low MFE and synonymous substitution rate using RNAalifold. studies on frameshifting and cap-independent translation in BYDV showed that both local and distant sequences are required for full activity. CP readthrough elements are shown in green. pseudoknots are found in specific parts of the viral genome involved in translation and replication. the domain IIIf of the HCV IRES (Figure 7A) is a pseudoknot. a highly structured 5\u2032UTR with multiple upstream AUGs could inhibit translation of the main open reading frame (mORF) of a eukaryotic mRNA. a ribosome first translate the small ORF (sORF) at the viral 5\u2032UTR. a structured motif called stop/restart cis-element located upstream of AUGA permits effective reinitation and translation of the second ORF. frameshift stimulators are highly diverse (Chen et al., 2010) in some cases, non-canonical base-pairs e.g., base triples (Chen et al., 2017) and long-range base-pairs may be required for 1 frameshifting. a slippery site is usually searched between the two frames (zero and 1). de novo pseudoknot computational prediction remains challenging. current tools are 5% accurate. ribosomal frameshifting sites can be predicted specifically using KnotInFrame. retroviral dimerization initiation sites (DIS) is involved in dimerization of virus genomic RNAs. a tRNA-like structure harbors a four-way junction. in enteroviruses, a cloverleaf structure known as oriL is involved in viral replication. many positive strand plant viruses have such tRNA-like structures in the 3\u2032UTRs of genomic RNAs. most viral tRNA-like structures are aminoacylated (e.g., by Val, His, or Tyr), mimicking cellular tRNAs to regulate translation. methods based on MFE when applied to long RNAs (e.g., mfold on a viral genome) will tend to predict large structures with a large number of long-distance interactions. experimentally determined structures of full length genomes show more local than long-range interactions. the loop of origin of assembly stem-loop on RNA2 interacts with on RNA1. specific softwaree.g., RNAhybrid can be used to predict such inter-molecular interactions. a stem-loop can be built up into more complex structures. the domain IIIf of the HCV IRES (Figure 7A) and the dumbbell structures of dengue virus 2 (Figure 5) are important in viral replication, transcription and translation. many RNA viruses hijack the host translation machinery and utilize unusual translation mechanisms for protein synthesis. Feline calicivirus contains two ORFs with a slightly overlapping sequence AUGA. a termination upstream ribosome-binding site (TURBS) located in the RNA structure allows tethering of 40S ribosomal subunit and eIF3. a ribosome first encounters the slowly decoded codons of the slippery site. a ribosome then \u201cslips\u201d one nucleotide backward (1 frame; XXX YYY Z) to resume translation elongation. a frameshift stimulator downstream (e.g., RNA structure) of the slippery site is required for physiological frameshifting. models in 3D can be built of pseudoknots e.g., using MC-Sym as was recently done for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. kissing hairpins are formed from the base-pairing between the loop of two stem-loops. many kissing hairpins are related to virus replication or transcription. dotKnot (Sperschneider and Datta, 2010), pKnots (Rivas and Eddy, 1999), pKiss (Theis et al., 2010), and pAliKiss (Janssen and Giegerich, 2015) could also be used to predict such kissing hairpins. however, these are limited to predicting intramolecular kissing interactions. tRNA-like structures can act as mobile elements in plant by promoting transport of viral transcripts via phloem sap. the tRNA-like structure of tobacco mosaic virus was recently solved by X-ray crystallography. specific tools have been developed to predict long-range interactions. 14 of 16 known long-distance interactions confirmed and plausible candidates from other viruses predicted. efficient frameshifting, in addition to the local frameshifting elements, may require long-range interactions. the IRES recruits ribosomes near or directly to the translation initiation codons of viral mRNAs, bypassing the need for the cap-binding complex. this allows the virus to manipulate the host translation machinery by inhibition or proteolytic cleavage of host eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) the large ribosomal subunit dissociates but the small subunit bypasses the RNA structure, docks on a landing site and resumes scanning. the shunt elements were discovered in DNA viruses, first in the pararetrovirus cauliflower mosaic virus (F\u00fctterer et al., 1990, 1993), then a retrovirus, prototype foamy virus (Schepetilnikov et al., 2009), and a plant RNA virus, rice tungro long-distance base-pairing has been well-characterized in several plant viral RNAs. for example, BYDV has a CITE located at the 3\u2032 end. this element interacts with a stem-loop located at the 5\u2032UTR. other viral genera also use long-distance base-pairing or interaction with rRNA. stop-start cis-elements in Caliciviruses and Influenza B viruses are found between 84 and the start codon of the second ORF. these cis-elements consist of a termination upstream ribosome-binding site (TURBS) and a stop/restart site. cis-elements also enable translation of a synthetic, non-overlapping second ORF effectively within a range of 40 nucleotides downstream of the first ORF. motif 1 (18S rRNA complementary site) is likely present between 84 and the start codon of the second ORF. VIPS and IRESPred predict IRES based on known IRES sequences and structures. a combination of tools, in particular BLAST, Pfold, Centroid Fold, mfold, and pKiss have proven to be useful in IRES prediction. shunt elements were discovered in DNA viruses, first in the pararetrovirus cauliflower mosaic virus. shunt take-off site and landing site expected to be conserved between closely related viruses or co-evolved viruses. shunt cis-elements are remarkably similar between a pair of co-evolved viruses, a RNA picorna-like virus, rice tungro spherical virus and a DNA pararetrovirus. stop-start cis-elements in Caliciviruses and Influenza B viruses are found between 84 and the start codon of the second ORF. these mechanisms require several cis-regulatory elements that can be partially structured. these mechanisms are distinct from the mechanisms utilizing upstream ORFs (uORFs), or programmed ribosomal frameshifting (Miras et al., 2017). motif 2 and 2* could form an RNA structure that enhances translation of the second ORF (Lee et al., 2017). cis-elements were found in helminthosporium victoriae virus 190S. these elements consist of a H-type pseudoknot and an AUGA stop/restart site. some challenges remain for the application of newer RNA structure tools in virology. some are being addressed by user friendly suites and tools becoming available. specialized workshops and training may facilitate the use of these RNA tools."}
