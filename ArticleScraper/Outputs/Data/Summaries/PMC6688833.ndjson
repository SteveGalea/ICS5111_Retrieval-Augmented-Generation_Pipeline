{"summary": "a substantial proportion of pediatric traumatic injuries is preventable [2]. however, many countries are using strategies, including educational programs, to prevent these injuries. the results of a comprehensive nationwide study in some specific countries are likely to be applicable to many other countries with similar socioeconomic and environmental conditions. nationwide-sample data was obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (NHISS) NHISS has released random nationwide-sample cohort data that are stratified according to age, sex, region, and other variables annually since 2002. the data consist of the claim records of approximately 1 million patients each year. year NHISS data Single-institutional data National statistical data Number of released cases* Number of included cases** Number of included cases** Total Korean population 0\u201314 years (%) 2006 996,393 2,421 2,560 48,438,292 8,979,585 (18.5%) for patients with >1 claim record with an S-code, only the first entry was included. from the single-institutional data, sex, age, diagnostic code, claim date, date of ED visit, place of injury (location where the injury occurred, classified as home, public place, school, restaurant, medical center, and others) a linear regression model was used to evaluate the trends in incidences by year. p-values 0.05 were considered significant. datasets Two different databases were retrospectively reviewed for this study. NHISS has released random nationwide-sample cohort data since 2002. the data consist of the claim records of approximately 1 million patients each year. age is categorized in 5-year increments to avoid revealing sensitive patient information. 1 million cases released by NHISS each year. patients aged 15 years who received an S-code diagnosis were included. single-institutional data Patients aged 15 years who received an S-code diagnosis were included. a total of 39,228 patients were included in the analyses. the number of included patients from each data source per year and corresponding national annual population statistics of south Korea are presented in Table 1. The numbers of pediatric traumatic injury cases in the NHISS and single-institutional data. data obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service. for patients with >1 claim record with an S-code, only the first entry was included. for patients with >1 claim record with an S-code, only the first entry was included. data analyses The annual incidence rates per 1 million claim cases each year were presented for the NHISS data. a linear regression model was used to evaluate the trends in incidences by year. n (%) Open wound 15,191 (38.7%) 12,548 (35.8%) Superficial injury 8,890 (22.7%) 8,455 (24.1%) Dislocation/sprain/strain 4,399 (11.2%) 7,107 (20.3%) Injury of muscle/tendon 5,049 (12.9%) 4,171 (11.9%) Fracture 4,521 (11.5%) 1,702 (4.9%) Others 1,178 (3.0%) 1,081 (3.1%) Number of visits by month, n injuries of the trunk or proximal extremities such as the shoulders or hips were rare. low-energy injuries such as open wounds or superficial injuries were most common in both datasets. incidences decreased abruptly in 2015 in both datasets. NHISS data for the standardized injury incidence rate per 1 million claim cases by year became more rapid after standardization to the population composition in 2006. despite a decreased proportion of children aged 0\u201314 years, the injury incidence rate increased over time. the rate of pediatric traumatic injuries may have increased more rapidly than assumed. the head was the most frequently injured body part, whereas the trunk and proximal extremities were rarely injured across all age groups. upper extremity injuries distal to the elbow () were more frequent than lower-extremity injuries distal to the knee () in younger children. fracture is a rare injury type in young children but relatively common in children aged >5 years. most common injury type in children aged >11 years. 67 (8.0%) 230 (6.9%) 62 (1.8%) 1\u20132 S01 S00 S06 S53 S60 S61 5744 (42.4%) 2093 (15.4%) 1542 (11.4%) 1358 (10.0%) 515 (3.8%) 242 (1.8%) 3\u20134 S01 S00 S06 S53 S60 S42 3274 (42.0%) 987 (12.7%) 811 (10.4%) 583 (7.5%) 242 (3.1%) 199 (2.6%) 5\u2013 69.2% at 1\u20132 years, 65.1% at 3\u20134 years, and 36.5% at 13\u201314 years. superficial injuries and open wounds of the head comprised approximately one-half of all injuries in children aged 8 years. n (%) Male 24,640 (62.8%) 21,644 (61.7%) Female 14,588 (37.2%) 13,420 (38.3%) Age, n (%) 0\u20134 years 24,700 (63.0%) 17,479 (49.8%) 5\u20139 years 9,204 (23.5%) 10,272 (29.3%) 10\u201314 years 5,316 (13.6%) 7,313 (20.9%) Injured body part, n (%) Head 26,931 (68.7%) 17,230 (49. n (n/day) Weekday 24,517 (9.4/day) 20,123 (7.7/day) Weekend 14,711 (14.1/day) 14,941 (14.3/day) Ratio of weekend/weekday injuries per day 1.50 1.86 Injuries by day of the year, n (n/day) Working day 22,992 (9.2/day) 18,407 (7.4/day) Holiday 16,236 (14.1/day) 16,657 (14.5/day) Ratio the incidence rate tended to increase during the 10-year study period ( = 0.877, p = 0.001) decrease in 2015 may be explained by the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome. related injuries increased rapidly during the study period. single-institutional data regarding injured body parts by age group (years) the head was the most frequently injured body part, whereas the trunk and proximal extremities were rarely injured across all age groups. upper extremity injuries distal to the elbow () were more frequent than lower-extremity injuries distal to the knee () in younger children. fracture is a rare injury type in young children. it became the most common injury type in children aged >11 years. data are presented as n (%). 232 (10.0%) 125 (5.4%) 124 (5.3%) 91 (3.9%) 11\u201312 S01 S06 S00 S02 S52 S62 409 (18.9%) 254 (11.8%) 187 (8.7%) 161 (7.5%) 136 (6.3%) 90 (4.2%) 13\u201314 S01 S02 S06 S00 S52 S82 331 (15.9%) 250 (12.0%) 244 (11.7%) 185 (8.9%) 111 (5.3%) 79 (3.8 the differences in the frequency of emergency department visits by month became more apparent as age increased. for older children, the visit frequency peaked in may and June, which is a period suitable for outdoor activities. by contrast, the frequency of visits was lowest during winter. the proportion of children (aged 0\u201314 years) among the whole population is decreasing. however, the incidences of pediatric traumatic injury in both datasets increased over time. more effective preventive measures are necessary to address rapid growth in the incidences of pediatric traumatic injuries over the past 10 years. characteristics of injuries in preschoolers In children aged 5 years, the head was the most frequently injured body part followed by the upper extremities distal to the elbow. low-energy injuries (that is, superficial injuries such as abrasions or open wounds) were the most common injury type (Table 4). a diagnostic code of S53 was relatively common in children aged 5 years of age, but was relatively common in older children. this finding could indicate that pediatric injuries frequently occur in this period; however, it could also be a result of patients visiting the outpatient clinic rather than the ED during earlier periods (9 am to 5 pm) NHISS and single-institutional data were similar in many aspects. it is necessary to recognize the possibility of selection bias caused by referrals of more severe cases to our institute, which is a tertiary referral hospital. the decreases in 2015 may be attributable to the national recommendation to avoid ED visits where possible to suppress the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome. the increase in trampolines in many indoor playgrounds and trampoline-related injuries could be a contributing factor [21]. the diagnostic code S53 was common in children aged 5 years. it denotes a dislocation, sprain, or strain of the elbow or forearm. the rate of lower-extremity injuries was higher in older children. visits to the ED peaked between 7 and 10 pm (Fig 3C) this finding could indicate that pediatric injuries frequently occur in this period. however, it could also be due to difficulties among parents in accessing healthcare facilities given the high proportion of young working couples in authors\u2019 country. pediatric traumatic injuries have increased, including the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries. the most commonly injured body part was the head, followed by the upper extremities distal to the elbow (elbow to hand) and the lower extremities distal to the knee (knee to foot)"}
