{"summary": "sgmRNAs in gill-associated virus (GAV) and sgmRNAs 3, 4, and 5 in equine torovirus (EToV) lack a leader sequence identical to the 5\u2032 end of the genome [5]\u2013[6]. sgmRNAs are 3\u2032-coterminal and contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome [7]\u2013[9]. a 25\u201359-nucleotide (nt) sequence motif within the leader sequence has been demonstrated to be required for transcription using MHV DI RNA with CAT gene. the role of the leader sequence in genome translation remains unknown. a mutation was found downstream of the leader that caused an enhancement of gene expression rather than attenuation of translation. functional analyses of BCoV DI RNA suggested that the leaderless genome is able to attenuate translation, negative-strand synthesis, and transcription. therefore, the leaderless genome identified during BCoV persistence appears associated with the attenuation of gene expression. no RT-PCR product showing a leaderless genome was found at the earlier time points. the major band (>200 bp) had an intact positive-strand 5\u2032-terminal 65-nt leader sequence. the minor band (200 bp) lacked the 5\u2032-terminal 69 nt (Fig. 1D) in BCoV persistently infected cells, there are an estimated 10 and 500 molecules of genome and sgmRNA 7 per cell, respectively. 0 and 10 molecules of genome negative strand and sgmRNA 7 negative strand per cell were produced from RNA extracted at 67, 77 and 92 dpi. the RT-PCR product with the shorter length lacked the 3\u2032-terminal 69 nt (Fig. S1C) RT-PCR product was synthesized by the method described in Fig. 1A. RT-PCR products with a size of more than 200 bp (lanes 2\u20137, marked with black arrowhead) and with a size of less than 200 bp (lanes 6\u20137, marked with white arrowhead) were observed. the upper panel shows part of the first 88-nt sequence of the 5\u2032 UTR in the positive-strand BCoV genomic RNA RT-PCR products with a length of more than 200 bp were detected. RT-PCR products with a size of more than 200 bp were detected. the identification of a previously unnoticed leaderless genomic RNA during BCoV persistent infection raises a question. oV DI RNAs BM65Ahis (with the leader sequence) and 69-BM65Ahis (without the leader sequence) containing the MHV 3\u2032 UTR were constructed. the last 5 nt of the 3\u2032 UTR of both constructs were deleted. antibody specific to the histidine tag was used as a tag in both constructs. RT and the M protein gene in the coronavirus genome was used to test for a potential recombinant generated during infection. no RT-PCR product was observed, thus ruling out the expression of the protein from a recombinant molecule. anneal to the BCoV M protein gene were used for PCR to detect potential recombination between the BCoV genome and BM65Ahis (Fig. 2E, lane 2), 69-BM65Ahis (Fig. 2E, lane 2), or 69-BM65Ahis5 (Fig. 2H, lane 3) the recombinant DNA of 1,639 nt was generated by overlap RT-PCR. the leader sequence in the coronavirus genome is to enhance translation. it appears that translation is decreased during BCoV infection as a result of the lower translation efficiency of leaderless genomic RNA. the leader sequence has been demonstrated to be a cis-acting element critical for BCoV RNA replication. negative-strand DI RNA detected was not from a potential DI RNA-coronavirus genome recombinant. no RT-PCR product derived from the recombinant was observed. 69-BM65Ahis was 30% less than that from BM65Ahis. a recombinant DNA of 1,639 nt was produced to serve as a size marker. a nested set of sgmRNAs are produced from which the coronavirus structural proteins are translated. this protein has been linked to viral assembly and pathogenesis. a 120-nt RT-PCR product was obtained with the same primer set from 69EGFP. the sgmRNA RT-PCR product was synthesized from 69EGFP. no RT-PCR product was identified indicating that the synthesized sgmRNAs were from the input DI RNAs. sgmRNA synthesis from the leaderless genome (69EGFP) is less efficient than that from the leader-containing genome (DIEGFP) the results suggest that a leaderless genome carrying a transcription signal is able to serve as a template for sgmRNA synthesis. cloned 120-nt RT-PCR product from individual DI RNA constructs shown in Fig. 4B. lane 7 and lane 15 showed the leader-body junction (indicated with vertical bar), the IS UCUAAAC (indicated with thin line) and the AUG translation start codon (indicated with thick line) sgmRNA synthesized from the leaderless genome is able to serve as a template for translation. percentage of fluorescing cells observed from 69EGFP was 0.8%. results suggest that the sgmRNA synthesized from the leaderless genome is able to serve as a template for translation. dpi that were not present earlier were the major product with a length larger than 200 bp and the minor product with a length smaller than 200 bp. concentration ratio of the major product to the minor product was roughly 5 to 1. a seminested PCR was performed at all time points but again no RT-PCR product showing a leaderless genome was found at the earlier time points. primer 1: BCV3\u2032UTR1() was used for the RT. but only RT-PCR products with a length of more than 200 bp were observed. we speculated that if there are leaderless negative-strand genomic RNAs in persistently-infected cells, they may be present in numbers too low to be detected. poly(A)-containing RNA was selected from total cellular RNA extracted from BCoV-persistently infected cells, treated with alkaline phosphatase, decapped with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, head-to-tail ligated with T4 RNA ligase I. RT-PCR products with a size of more than 200 bp (lanes 2\u20137, marked with black arrowhead) and with a size of less than RT-PCR product was synthesized by the method described in Fig. 1A. RNA sample was not treated with alkaline phosphatase and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. RT-PCR products with a length of more than 200 bp were detected. BCoV DI RNA is a naturally occurring DI RNA that has been employed as a surrogate for the BCoV genome to analyze cis-acting elements required for replication and translation. to test the effect of the leaderless genome on translation, replication-incompetent DI RNAs BM65Ahis (with the leader sequence) and 69-BM65Ahis (without the leader sequence) were constructed. onavirus genome may occur under certain selection pressures [46]\u2013[48]. the detected proteins may be translated from a recombinant containing the coronavirus genome and DI RNA genes. RT-PCR using primers that anneal to the reporter sequence in DI RNA (for RT) and the M protein gene in the coronavirus genome was used to test for a potential recombinant. recombinant DNA of 1,639 nt shown in lane 4 of Figs. 2E and 2H was generated by overlap RT-PCR and was used as a size marker for the product generated using the primers MHV3\u2032UTR2(+) and M3(). translation efficiency from 69-BM65Ahis5 was 3-fold less at 4 and 8 hpt. translation efficiency between the two constructs was closer at 21 hpt. the same primers were also employed to identify potential recombination between DI RNA and the virus genome. negative-strand DI RNA detected was not from a potential DI RNA-coronavirus genome recombinant because no RT-PCR product derived from the recombinant was observed. results suggest that the leader sequence is required for efficient negative-strand DI RNA synthesis. RT-PCR to detect potential recombination between the BCoV genome and DI RNA. a recombinant DNA of 1,639 nt was produced to serve as a size marker. a nested set of sgmRNAs are produced from which the coronavirus structural proteins are translated. primer set that anneals to the leader sequence and EGFP sequence. cloned 120-nt molecule was abundantly present throughout 48-h experiment. sgmRNA synthesis from 69EGFP was based on the leader-body junction sequence. internal controls included DI RNA DIEGFP or 69EGFP, helper virus N sgmRNA, and 18S rRNA. results suggest that a leaderless genome carrying a transcription signal is able to serve as a template for sgmRNA synthesis. but sgmRNA synthesis from the leaderless genome (69EGFP) is less efficient than that from the leader-containing genome (DIEGFP) a recombinant DNA of 1,309 nt (lane 21) was produced by overlap RT-PCR. cDNA-cloned 120-nt RT-PCR product from Fig. 4B, lane 7 and lane 15 showed the leader-body junction (indicated with vertical bar) and the IS UCUAAAC (indicated with thin line) for EGFP. EGFP fluorescence was observed in BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells. but not in DIEGFP- or 69EGFP-transfected mock-infected HRT-18 cells. percentage of fluorescing cells was 0.8% for DIEGFP and 0.9% for 69EGFP. equine torovirus sgmRNAs 3\u20135 are used as terminators of transcription during negative-strand synthesis. the leaderless genomic RNA observed in this study lacked the first 69 nt of the entire 5\u2032-end leaderless genomic RNA. the first nt of the 5\u2032-end leaderless genomic RNA is the 70th nt of the 5\u2032-end leader-containing genomic RNA. initiation site of positive-strand leaderless genomic RNA in the present study. based on these findings, the intergenic sequence may play the dual roles of promoter and terminator [6], [55], and the 5\u2032-most nt of the crossover region on the positive-strand DI RNA observed in this study. therefore, we propose the following model for how the leader-containing and leaderless genomes are generated. coronaviral polymerase recognizes the 3\u2032-proximal intergenic sequence on negative-strand leader-containing genomic template as a promoter. further studies are required to elucidate a detailed mechanism of how the leaderless genome is synthesized during BCoV persistent infection. coronavirus polymerase recognizes the 3\u2032-most nucleotide (cytosine) of the intergenic sequence UCUAAAC at position 70 on the positive-strand genomic RNA. the resulting leaderless negative-strand genomic RNA serves as a template for the generation of leaderless positive-strand genomic RNA. the discovery of a leaderless genome during coronavirus persistent infection has led us to attempt a systematic analysis of leaderless genome behavior. it has been shown that substitution of the -globin mRNA 5\u2032 UTR with the MHV leader sequence enhances the translation of -globin mRNA [22] the number of DI RNA templates between input leader-containing and leaderless DI RNA was almost the same at 4 and 8 hpt. however, the less templates of leaderless DI RNA used for transcription could also be a factor to impair the efficiency of sgmRNA synthesis at later times of infection. the reasons for the various observations remain unclear; however, we speculate that the experimental approaches may be partly responsible for the different outcomes. alterations in the 5\u2032 UTR of the genome and sgmRNA have been employed by BCoV to attenuate the gene expression that may correlate to the persistent infection of BCoV. functional analyses of the leaderless genomic RNA using BCoV DI RNA revealed that the leader sequence on the genomic RNA is required for coronaviral translation, replication, and transcription. total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) during acute and persistent infection.
