{"summary": "six different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits were available in korea. the kits were based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) these kits were based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. a total of six different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits were available in Korea. the kits were based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) none of these kits have been approved for diagnostic use. only realStar MERS-CoV (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) had been approved for the in vitro diagnosis of MERS-CoV. all six commercial kits evaluated in this study had not been validated for diagnostic use. each kit was validated by using the equipment recommended by each manufacturer. PlexQ and Anyplex kits were modified from the WHO-recommended rRT-PCR assay. but the kit covered almost the same regions of upE and ORF1a. the oligonucleotide-binding site for ORF1a was beyond the span of the RNA transcripts used in this study. 28 respiratory virus-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were used to determine cross-reactions with human RNA or other respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses. nasopharyngeal swabs were used to determine cross-reactions with human RNA or other respiratory viruses. the RNA eluates of nine specimens were used after initial clinical rRT-PCR testing. the other nine specimens were manually prepared in our laboratory without any pretreatment. the other nine specimens with high inhibition were used to evaluate clinical sensitivity. the LODs for upE of three different 1-step kits, the AccuPower, Light Mix, and Ultrafast kits, were >2.0 log copies/reaction, which was less sensitive than those of three different 2-step kits. none of the kits tested in this study showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. the log LOD values of upE (A) and ORF1a (B) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown, but there were no CI values for Anyplex single upE. the 95% CI values overlapped among the kits, except for the LOD of ORF1a with PowerChek duplex. the internal control Ct value was determined by using an rRT-PCR reaction for upE. the internal control Ct value was determined by using an rRT-PCR reaction. the effect of PCR inhibition determined by testing the nine high inhibition specimens revealed that 3-5 of the six known positive specimens were found negative or invalid by each kit. the Ct values of the internal controls from all specimens were high or extended beyond the total amplification cycles. the powerChek and AccuPower kits produced two uncertain results with known positive specimens and one uncertain result with a known negative specimen.

RNA transcripts used to assess the analytical sensitivity in detecting upE and ORF1a rRT-PCR kits were analyzed with the same RNA transcripts used to evaluate realStar MERS-CoV (Altona Diagnostics), which is the only kit thus far approved for diagnosis. the LODs for upE of the kits assessed in this study indicated approximately 10-fold lower sensitivity than the previously reported 95% cut-off value of 5.3 copies/reaction for RealStar MERS-CoV [9] the overall sensitivities for detecting upE of the kits evaluated herein were consistently lower than that of the realStar kit. only the LOD for ORF1a using the PowerChek kit was similar to that of the realStar kit: 9.3 copies/reaction using the power realStar MERS-CoV has a higher sensitivity or lower specificity than other assays. sensitivity test panel included positive specimens with wide range of Ct values. sensitivity test panel included positive specimens with a wide range of Ct values. study was determining the effects of PCR inhibition on clinical sensitivity. the internal controls of the PowerChek kit were not affected by the inhibition. this could be because the powerChek kit uses a less sensitive internal control intrinsic to human cells."}
