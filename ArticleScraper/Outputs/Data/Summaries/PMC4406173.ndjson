{"summary": "in vitro study elucidated inhibitory effects of astragalin on oxidative stress-induced airway fibrosis. astragalin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside from leaves of persimmon and green tea seeds, accelerated E-cadherin loss and vimentin induction in airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells. induction of autophagy by spermidine influenced the epithelial induction of E-cadherin and vimentin blocked by treating astragalin."}
