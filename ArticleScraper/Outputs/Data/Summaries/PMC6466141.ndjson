{"summary": "nucleocapsid assembly requires packaging of the genomic RNA (gRNA) in an infected cell. in vivo assembly of some viruses from the Picornaviridae [1,2,3] and Secoviridae [4] families results in a small fraction of capsid proteins assembling into empty capsids. in vitro approaches have shown that RNA packaging selectivity depends on highly specific interactions between the gRNA and the capsid protein (CP) the structural element (and/or sequence) in the gRNA responsible for these interactions is often referred to as a \u201cpackaging signal\u201d (PS) in vivo and in cultured cells experiments have shown that specific gRNA-CP interactions are necessary but not sufficient to explain packaging specificity observed during an infection. the study of (+)ssRNA viruses so attractive is that even viruses that are evolutionarily very distant from each other can share a large number of similarities. in this article we compare results from in vitro, in vivo (plants) and cultured cell experiments to draw a general picture that takes into account multiple mechanisms and interactions. the motivation of this article is to start a discussion about the diversity of mechanisms by which (+)ssRNA viruses package their genome.

No ** Leviviridae Levivirus Enterobacteria phage MS2 Multiple viruses are usually more complex than bacteriophages and plant viruses. many of them incorporate multiple copies of glycoproteins (membrane proteins) and a host-cell derived membrane [57,58] members of the Caliciviridae [60,61] and Picornaviridae [62] families are non-enveloped viruses that do not contain membrane proteins. VPg is covalently linked to the 5\u2019-end of the gRNA. the assembly of (+)ssRNA viruses requires protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. this process is spontaneous, and virion assembly and RNA packaging are coupled with each other. this finding is in accord with experiments in cultured cells [97,98] and in protoplasts. the work from the Stockley, Twarock and Dykeman groups has demonstrated that selective packaging requires not only the \u201ccanonical PS\u201d but a series of PS-like elements. the original concept of a high-affinity binding mechanism between the PS and the CP is not always consistent with some in vitro and in vivo data [109]. membrane remodeling segregates the gRNA from the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum by forming vesicles. this segregation appears crucial for flaviviruses (e.g., Hepatitis C and Dengue viruses) in BMV this segregation was initially observed in a yeast-based system [125]. however, Chaturvedi, S. et al. showed that the role of BMV RdRp on RNA packaging select the best-known PSs and assembly processes is that of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in the absence of a nucleic acid and under non-physiological conditions, TMV CP can be assembled in vitro into structures similar to the native capsid [140,141,142]. this indicates that neither the presence of the PS nor the RNA is an absolute requirement for in vitro capsid assembly. however, the fact that capsids can assemble without RNA under solution conditions that are very different from Qu and Morris narrowed down the TCV PS to 186 nt by measuring the ability of different deletion mutants to be packaged in vivo. however, this PS is located in the CP and not in the RdRp gene. they inserted the TCV PS into the tomato bushy stunt virus gRNA (chimeric RNA) a 132 nt-long fragment from the genome of the alphavirus Sindbis (SINV) had a high-binding affinity for the SINV CP. insertions or deletions in this region disrupt the coding of the non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) the differences between SFV and RRV PSs are a clear example of why we should not extrapolate what we learn from one virus to all members of its family. by using a bioinformatic approach the Frolov group proposed that the PS for the SINV clade (e.g., chikungunya virus (RRV)) is in the nsP1 gene. chimeric alphaviruses are located in different genes (i.e., nsP1 and nsP2, respectively) chimeric RNA competes only against cellular RNAs and the sgRNA, but not against the molecule that has evolved to be packaged by the CP. similar studies with chimeric SINV/RRV viruses confirm cross-packaging. Twarock and Dykeman developed a mathematical approach to find RNA elements within the genome of interest that have a similar motif as the RNA aptamer chosen during the SELEX step. they did single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sm-FCS) to in vitro assemble different CPs (i.e., STNV, MS2 and HBV) to test these putative PSs. they showed that only RNAs containing the PS assembled into stable a series of unpaired Guanosyl residues distributed along the 5 UTR and Gag open reading frame [110,157,158] this type of PS is consistent with the multiple PS-like scenario. on the other hand, the Lomonossof group has strong evidence that mutations that should disrupt the in vitro-identified STNV PS have no effect on in vivo packaging. nugent and co-workers used a replication-competent poliovirus RNA to investigate whether RNA replication by an active RdRp is required for selective packaging. this RNA had deletions in the capsid gene (replicon RNA); thus, it could only be packaged in the presence of an RNA that contains the structural proteins (helper RNA) cells with the nonreplicating clone resulted in the assembly of particles that contained only cellular RNAs. in the absence of the RdRp the amount of nonreplicating RNA is considerably lower than for the WT RNA or when the transfected cells constitutively express the RdRp. in this case the viral RNA is not one of the predominant species. a DH RNA to be packaged depends on the presence of the ORF1, which contains the genes required for RNA replication and also the putative PS. the presence of nsP1-3 is essential to make the DH RNAs persist among the population of viral RNAs produced during experiments. the two most studied viruses belong to the Bromovirus genus. RNA 1 and 2 code for the two proteins that constitute the RdRp. RNA 3 has two ORFs: the first code for the movement protein and the second code for the CP. CCMV and BMV may not require a PS and packaging depends entirely on the ability of an RNA to be replicated. this implies that packaging depends entirely on the ability of an RNA to be replicated. cellular RNAs and the sgRNA were packaged to levels comparable with each other. the presence of active replication or a functional RdRp rescued the packaging specificity of the sgRNA. dRp proposed that the RNA synthesized by the RdRp is likely to be present in a more suitable conformation for packaging than RNA synthesized by the cellular RNA polymerase. the same group showed that neither RNA 1 nor 2 were efficiently packaged if the CP was supplied in trans from a nonreplicating RNA (i.e., as an independent mRNA) double-membrane vesicles (HCV [124,174,175] and convoluted membranes (DENV [124] induce one of two different membrane alterations. it is not clear if these replication sites are always associated with nucleocapsid assembly, although viruses have been observed inside these structures. assembly factories of the Togaviruses SFV, SINV and Rubella virus (RUBV) are localized around endosomes and lysosomes and create cytopathic vacuoles (CPV) in these cases, the remodeled membranes act as assembly sites. spherules are internalized and assembled into CPVs [182] Bamunsinghe et al. used immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to explore the subcellular localization of BMV CP synthesis. CP localizes in the ER and overlaps with the viral replication sites. assembly and RNA packaging occur in the presence of a large and diverse population of cellular and viral-derived RNAs, yet only the gRNA is packaged. this observation leads to a series of questions: what makes the gRNA different from cellular and viral-derived RNAs so that only the full-length viral RNA is packaged. the HIV-1 PS (known as ), located within the 5\u2019UTR of the gRNA, controls selective packaging by establishing high-affinity interactions with the structural polyprotein Gag [187,188]. this mechanism is not consistent with the fact that under physiologically relevant salt concentrations the difference in binding affinities between and any other nucleic acid to Gag is very small. the new interest in PS has overshadowed the contribution of RNA replication, translation and compartmentalization to RNA packaging. the new interest in PS has overshadowed the contribution of RNA replication, translation and compartmentalization to RNA packaging. if more than one RNA molecule is packaged, it is possible that the amount of packaged nucleotides is a key factor. it is not clear how sgRNA packaging is regulated in Bromoviruses or how the sgRNAs in the Betacarmoviruses are excluded during packaging. sgRNA of nodaviruses cannot be packaged because is too small compared to the other two RNAs. this scenario is consistent with in vitro packaging efficiency experiments with CCMV CP and truncated RNAs that showed that there is an optimal RNA length and number of total nucleotides required for high packaging efficiency. selective packaging in flaviviruses is primarily due to RNA replication/co-translational packaging within the assembly sites and not by a PS-mediated mechanism. there are a few cases in which a PS can be the primary, if not the only, determinant for assembly. a series of interactions and characteristics that are specific to each species can be shared among viruses that belong to the same genus or family, or even between unrelated viruses. a virus that packages the wrong RNA is a dead end."}
