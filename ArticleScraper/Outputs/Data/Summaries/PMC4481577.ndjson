{"summary": "METHODS We searched the published literature to produce an inventory of methods used to extract actionable information from influenza surveillance or study data. we confined our search to articles reporting for analyses of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. a further important feature of the surveyed approaches was the mathematical style of the method, which we categorized as \u2018statistical\u2019 or \u2018simulation\u2019. a further important feature of the surveyed approaches was the mathematical style of the method, which we categorized as \u2018statistical\u2019 or \u2018simulation\u2019.

Richards population growth model The basic reproduction number R0 is estimated by fitting infection curves to incidence data from early in outbreak. serial interval estimation Candidate probability distributions are fitted to frequency histograms of observed serial intervals [42] table entries show that there are 10 methods for the calculation of R0 and 2 for the calculation of the transmission probability. all but one of these methods can be used at the early stages of a pandemic. each of these methods are simulation-based and may take a month or longer to implement. a large number of new IDM methods are under development to answer questions relating to basic epidemiology, such as the calculation of the basic reproduction number. a major reason for the proliferation of methods for calculating epidemiological quantities is the tendency for authors to publish novel scientific methods. the number of parameters individual-based models contain can be so large that it becomes infeasible to attribute changes in summary statistics to changes in specific parameter values (eg, contact rates between age groups) there are very few published studies that attempt to collate the literature with the aim of bringing together the questions that are asked by leaders during a public health emergency. public health agencies will be better served by embracing new analytical methods. IDM modelers can better serve such agencies by taking the time to ensure their methods are accessible and address the specific needs of public health practitioners, and not only their own research priorities. the most widely used of these is the S-E-I-R model in which the population occupies one of the following mutually exclusive states: S-Susceptible, E-Exposed, I-Infected, R-Recovered. the most widely used of these is the S-E-I-R model in which the population occupies one of the following mutually exclusive states. state space model: a discrete-time Markov form of a compartmental model that allows simplified analysis, simulation and fitting to data. each run on a computer is unique, and an ensemble of runs is necessary to produce an average model trajectory and uncertainty range."}
