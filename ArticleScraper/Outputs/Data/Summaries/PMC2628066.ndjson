{"summary": "influenza viruses are classified into groups A, B and C according to differences in the nucleocapsid and matrix protein. the type A viruses were divided into haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtypes based on the surface glycoproteins. human-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1) has been suggested in several household clusters. in 1997, human-to-human transmission apparently did not occur through social contact, and serologic studies showed that the transmission was inefficient. INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO H5N1 The early stage of an infection is often viewed as a race between the virus and the host's immune system. the first layer of immunity against virus invasion is the integrity of the body surface. the influenza antigens may travel to the regional cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes or to the spleen by dendritic cells (DCs), which exit at the respiratory tract. studies have found that only the CD8+ DCs can stimulate influenza peptide-specific T cells or hybridoma cell lines. at least five antigenic epitopes have been discovered for human influenza viruses. each epitope was capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in chickens. antibodies to the HA protein are of less importance than those to the HA protein. influenza A virus NS1 protein can inhibit adaptive immunity by attenuating human DC maturation and decreasing the number of DCs available to induce T-cell responses. the CDC's response has been focused on enhancing surveillance and laboratory testing for human avian influenza. ltamivir (Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (Relenza)70 but resistant to Amantadine and Rimantadine. treatment should be started within 48 hours of onset of fever. a higher dose of 150mg twice daily and treatment for 7 to 10 days is required."}
