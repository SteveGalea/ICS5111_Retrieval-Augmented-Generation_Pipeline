{"summary": "calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins of the C-type lectin family play a large role in the mammalian immune system. they recognize glycan structures with high selectivity via calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs)4 (3). the lectin is a type II transmembrane protein that recognizes high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides on viral envelopes and host glycoproteins (4). the affinity of DC-SIGNR for glycoproteins on the surface of viruses promotes in trans infection by transferring the virus to adjacent CD4+ T-cells. this promotes entry of the virus into host T-cells, promoting entry of the virus into host T-cells. this reinforces the important role of this protein in immunity as well as its considerable potential as a drug target. the DC-SIGNR CRD adopts a typical \u201clectin fold\u201d consisting of -helices and antiparallel -sheets connected by irregular loops. the structure of the DC-SIGNR CRD in complex with (GlcNAc)2Man3 provides insight into the CRD structure and potential ligand binding mechanism. residues that form direct contacts/bonds with the glycan in the structure of the (GlcNAc)2Man3CDR complex (1K9J; ligand not shown) are highlighted in red, disulfide bonds are shown in blue, and bound calcium ions are shown in green. however, crystal structures of the DC-SIGNR CRD bound to larger, physiologically relevant oligosaccharides have proved to be unattainable thus far. we present the backbone assignment of the DC-SIGNR CRD and the first structural data for binding of a disease-associated ligand, namely Man9GlcNAc. the same regions of the DC-SIGNR CRD are highly dynamic in both holo-form and ligand-bound form and interconvert between a number of conformations at similar rates. two 100-ml starter cultures were inoculated using colonies from an M9/ampicillin plate. starter cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24 h. once an A600 nm = 0.7 was reached, the 1-liter culture was induced with isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside. gp120 glycoprotein was harvested from 10 m kifunensine-treated HEK 293T cultures. the protein was then dissolved in 180 l of 20 mm deuterated HEPES-d18, 20 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, in 10% D2O, 90% H2O to a final concentration of 0.7 mm DC-SIGNR CRD. spectra were processed using topspin version 2.0 (unless otherwise stated) and analyzed using CCPN Analysis software version 2.1.5 (32, 33) and SPARKY version 3 (34). secondary structure predictions were carried out using TALOS+ (35) titration curves were fit to Equation 2, valid for 1:1 complex formation in fast exchange on the NMR chemical shift time scale. x and [P] represent the ligand and protein concentration, respectively, and max is the total chemical shift perturbation at saturation of ligand. relaxation data were acquired in an interleaved manner to minimize the effects of sample heating. peak heights were calculated and fit to a monoexponential decay in SPARKY 3 (34) protein CRD fragment was purified using a 2-ml mannose-Sepharose column. equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. protein migrated near its monomeric molecular mass of 17.1 kDa. proton chemical shifts were referenced against external DSS. nitrogen chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to DSS. one-dimensional proton spectra were acquired using the pulse sequence described by Liu et al. mm Man5 and 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm Man9GlcNAc. the three sugar fragments reached saturation by 10 mm, whereas relaxation properties prevented the determination of man9GlcNAc saturation. the weighting factor of 0.15 applied to the nitrogen chemical shift corresponds to the difference in magnetogyric ratios of 15N with 1H nuclei. relaxation times were measured using the procedures of Kay et al. (39) and Farrow et al. (40) for T1 measurements, 11 spectra were recorded with relaxation delays between 0.01 and 0.750 s. Matrices of 1024 128 complex data points were recorded, using 32 scans per t1 increment and a recycle delay of 3 s. two 100-ml starter cultures were inoculated using colonies from an M9/ampicillin plate. protein CRD fragment was purified using a 2-ml mannose-Sepharose column. protein migrated near its monomeric molecular mass of 17.1 kDa (for the isotopically labeled protein) gp120 glycoform was characterized by mass spectrometry as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. protein was then dissolved in 180 l of 20 mm deuterated HEPES-d18, 20 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, in 10% D2O, 90% H2O to a final concentration of 0.7 mm DC-SIGNR CRD. 128 increments in the t1 domain, 40 increments in the t2 domain, and 2048 increments in the t3 domain. specttra were processed using topspin version 2.0 (unless otherwise stated). titration curves were fit to Equation 2, valid for 1:1 complex formation in fast exchange on the NMR chemical shift time scale. x and [P] represent the ligand and protein concentration, respectively, and max is the total chemical shift perturbation at saturation of ligand. relaxation data were acquired in an interleaved manner to minimize the effects of sample heating. peak heights were calculated and fit to a monoexponential decay in SPARKY 3 (34). expression and Purification of 13C/15N Isotopically Labeled DC-SIGNR CRD. the protein was dissolved in 180 l of 20 mm deuterated HEPES-d18, 20 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, in 10% D2O, 90% H2O to a final concentration of 0.7 mm DC-SIGNR CRD. the protein predominantly migrated near its monomeric molecular mass of 17.1 kDa (for the isotopically labeled protein) triple resonance cold probe-equipped Varian Unity Inova 800-MHz spectrometer (Henry Wellcome Building for Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy, University of Birmingham) one-dimensional proton spectra were acquired using the pulse sequence described by Liu et al. (25) two-dimensional 1H\u201315N HSQC spectra were recorded with 128 increments in the t1 domain and 1024 data points in the t2 dimension. 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm Man9GlcNAc. the weighting factor of 0.15 applied to the nitrogen chemical shift corresponds to the difference in magnetogyric ratios of 15N with 1H nuclei. 11 spectra were recorded with relaxation delays between 0.01 and 0.750 s. Matrices of 1024 128 complex data points were recorded using 32 scans per t1 increment and a recycle delay of 3 s. the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the calcium-bound DC-SIGNR CRD is shown in Fig. 2. the sequential assignment of the N, C, and H nuclei along the protein backbone was achieved using a full suite of triple resonance experiments. of the 138 amino acids in the CRD, 5 proline residues do not appear in the HSQC spectrum. a series of HSQC spectra were acquired upon titration of the oligosaccharide fragment Man3, Man5, or (GlcNAc)2Man3 into the DC-SIGNR CRD. binding of all three sugars resulted in significant chemical shift perturbations along the length of the CRD. vertical lines represent the 1 S.D. cut-off used in each data set. chemical shifts with perturbations greater than 1 S.D. are shown in red mapped onto the structure of the (GlcNAc)2Man3CDR complex (Protein Data Bank code 1K9J) fewer perturbations in -helix 2 were observed upon binding of Man3 and Man5. however, man3 and Man5 binding significantly affect Ser-326, adjacent to Phe-325. the chemical shift perturbations observed here in solution also highlighted changes in additional regions of the CRD, distal to the proposed glycan binding site. Binding of Man9GlcNAc Derived from HIV gp120 to the DC-SIGNR CRD. similar titration experiments were carried out using Man9GlcNAc derived from the gp120 protein of HIV. similar titration experiments were carried out using man9GlcNAc. -helix 2 is not involved in binding to Man9GlcNAc, suggesting that it has a mode of binding to the CRD different from that of (GlcNAc)2Man3 and that DC-SIGNR may interact with the HIV glycoprotein gp120. ongoing work to determine a high resolution solution structure of DC-SIGNR CRD bound to this ligand will shed further light on this. galectin-3 (lactose bound with a KD of 231 m (46), galectin-3 (lactose bound with a KD of 2.75 m (47) and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (binding constants of 66\u2013539 m) were reported for a variety of simple sugars (48) but these KD values are in line with the IC50 values of the analogous protein DC-SIGN for fucose (1.2 g. galectin-1) also report increased affinity for larger, more complex glycans (45). however, an accurate KD could not be estimated using NMR under these conditions. a similar trend is seen in the T2 data for the Man5-bound CRD but with a slightly lower average T2 (66.54 8.23 ms) and more pronounced reduction of T2 values for the shaded regions in Fig. 7. asterisks along the bottom of each panel denote residues that are not observed due to fast relaxation or exchange. residues in the primary ca2+ binding loop and -sheets 6 and 7 display enhanced transverse relaxation in both the holo-form and ligand-bound form. a further reduction in T2 values of residues in the primary calcium binding loop are observed upon the addition of Man5. the holoprotein has not been shown to form part of the extended glycan binding site. the average T2 value decreased significantly from 76.27 to 66.54 ms upon ligand binding. a value for the relaxation-derived c of 10.4 0.4 ns was obtained for the holo-CRD, which is only slightly longer than the expected value of 8.55 ns. a small (2% as estimated using a published model (56)) increase in solution viscosity upon the addition of 10 mm Man5 may contribute to this change. however, these two factors are unlikely to fully account for the increase in rotational correlation time. binding-induced aggregation would result in a much larger increase in c. this suggests that there is a ligand-induced conformational change in the CRD. the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the calcium-bound DC-SIGNR CRD is shown in Fig. 2. the sequential assignment of the N, C, and H nuclei along the protein backbone was achieved using a full suite of triple resonance experiments. of the 138 amino acids in the CRD, 5 proline residues do not appear in the HSQC spectrum due to their lack of a backbone amide group. a series of HSQC spectra were acquired upon titration of the oligosaccharide fragment Man3, Man5, or (GlcNAc)2Man3 into the DC-SIGNR CRD. binding of all three sugars resulted in significant chemical shift perturbations along the length of the CRD. perturbations above this threshold were considered significant and are mapped onto the DC-SIGNR CRD. a schematic of the bound glycan is given in the lower right corner of each panel. binding of all three sugar fragments was consistent with a principal glycan binding site. binding of the glycan fragments was not universally consistent with the proposed \u201cshelf\u201d formed by -helix 2 and Phe-325. Man3 and Man5 binding induced perturbation of residues 270 and 271 at the N terminus of the CRD. (GlcNAc)2Man3 binding showed unique perturbations in the loop region consisting of residues 382\u2013385. this suggests that perturbations in this region may be due to the GlcNAc moieties, possibly in conjunction with their -(1,4) linkages to the trimannose core. similar titration experiments were carried out using Man9GlcNAc derived from the gp120 protein of HIV gp120. similar titration experiments were carried out using a single GlcNAc unit at the reducing terminus. this is consistent with a principal binding site containing residues in -sheets 6 and 7 and the primary calcium binding loop. a high resolution solution structure of DC-SIGNR CRD bound to this ligand will shed further light on this. the HSQC spectra of the CRD acquired at increasing concentrations of (GlcNAc)2Man3, Man3, or Man5 respectively. the three sugar fragments behaved similarly upon titration. this behavior is characteristic of fast exchange between free and bound protein on the NMR chemical shift time scale. KD values are in line with the IC50 values of the analogous protein DC-SIGN for fucose (1.2 mm) and mannose (1.8 mm) (16) shown is a fit of chemical shift perturbations versus glycan concentration to a single site binding model for (GlcNAc)2Man3 (A), Man3 (B), and Man5 (C) variable signal intensities prevented further study using three-dimensional NMR methods. weak or missing signals suggest that in its Ca2+-free form, the protein can exchange between an ensemble of conformational states with a rate corresponding to the intermediate exchange regime on the NMR chemical shift time scale. a similar trend is seen in the T2 data for the Man5-bound CRD but with a slightly lower average T2 (66.54 8.23 ms) and more pronounced reduction of T2 values for the shaded regions in Fig. 7. these data suggest that micro- to millisecond motions present in the holo-form of the CRD still persist upon glycan binding. residues across the entire primary Ca2+ binding loop and -sheets 6 and 7 display enhanced transverse relaxation in both the holo-form and ligand-bound form. a further reduction in T2 values of residues in the primary calcium binding loop are observed upon the addition of Man5. this supports previous reports that this is the site of key CRD-mannose interactions. the average T2 value decreased significantly from 76.27 to 66.54 ms upon ligand binding. this was confirmed by using the T1/T2 ratio (Fig. 7) to estimate the overall rotational correlation time (c) by first excluding residues that contained values more than one S.D. from the average. binding-induced aggregation would result in a much larger increase in c. this suggests that there is a ligand-induced conformational change in the CRD. however, no conformational changes have been observed upon ligand binding. of the 138 amino acids in the HSQC, 5 proline residues do not appear in the HSQC spectrum due to their lack of a backbone amide group. of the observable residues present in the HSQC, 96% have been unambiguously assigned (80% of the total CRD). binding of all three sugars resulted in significant chemical shift perturbations along the length of the CRD. perturbations above this threshold were considered significant and are mapped onto the DC-SIGNR CRD. binding of all three sugar fragments was consistent with a principal glycan binding site composed of the primary Ca2+-binding loop. residues in -sheets 6 and 7 at the core of the protein fold were not universally consistent with the proposed \u201cshelf\u201d formed by -helix 2 and Phe-325. Man3 and Man5 binding induced perturbation of residues 270 and 271 at the N terminus of the CRD. this suggests that perturbations in this region may be due to the GlcNAc moieties, possibly in conjunction with their -(1,4) linkages to the trimannose core. this suggests that a conformational or dynamics change is taking place in this region. man9GlcNAc binding results in no chemical shift changes for residues in the region thought to compose a \u201cshelf\u201d formed by -helix 2 and Phe-325. -helix 2 is involved in binding to (GlcNAc)2Man3 (and possibly to the smaller glycan fragments), which is in good agreement with 1K9J structure. the HSQC spectra of the CRD acquired at increasing concentrations of (GlcNAc)2Man3, Man3, or Man5 respectively. the three sugar fragments behaved similarly upon titration, displaying linear chemical shift perturbations and no line broadening as ligand concentration was increased. this behavior is characteristic of fast exchange between free and bound protein on the NMR chemical shift time scale. shown is a fit of chemical shift perturbations versus glycan concentration to a single site binding model for (GlcNAc)2Man3 (A), Man3 (B), and Man5 (C) only data derived from residues near -helix 2 are shown. binding of Man9GlcNAc caused substantial broadening and disappearance of a number of CRD peaks. ak or missing signals suggest that in its Ca2+-free form, the protein can exchange between an ensemble of conformational states with a rate corresponding to the intermediate exchange regime on the NMR chemical shift time scale. however, the variable signal intensity was only satisfactorily minimized after also raising the temperature from 25 to 37 \u00b0C. a similar trend is seen in the T2 data for the holo-state and Man5-bound state. to millisecond motions present in the holo-form of the CRD still persist upon glycan binding. shown is a plot of per residue values for 15N T1 (top), 15N T2 (middle) and 15N T1/T2 (bottom) for holo-DC-SIGNR CRD and Man5-bound (open circles) DC-SIGNR CRD. asterisks along bottom of each panel denote residues that are not observed due to sheets 6 and 7 show enhanced transverse relaxation in both the holo-form and ligand-bound form. the increased exchange contribution is possibly driven by the kinetics of Ca2+ binding. a further reduction in T2 values of residues in the primary calcium binding loop are observed upon the addition of Man5. the average T2 value decreased significantly from 76.27 to 66.54 ms upon ligand binding. we have attributed this reduction to slower tumbling of the ligand-bound protein compared with the holoprotein in solution. this was confirmed by using the T1/T2 ratio to estimate the overall rotational correlation time (c) no conformational changes have been observed in any published crystal structures for DC-SIGNR CRD upon ligand binding. a 0.7 mm sample of the recombinant 138-residue fragment was prepared with uniform 13C/15N labeling. the purity, secondary structure, and oligomeric state were probed. of the observable residues present in the HSQC, 96% have been unambiguously assigned (80% of the total CRD). the HSQC spectrum and annotated backbone assignment of holo-DC-SIGNR CRD showed 96% of the observed 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances assigned. binding of all three sugars resulted in significant chemical shift perturbations along the length of the CRD. the S.D. of the chemical shift perturbation across all residues was used (36) to determine the residues most affected by binding. perturbations above this threshold were considered significant. binding of the glycan fragments was not universally consistent with the proposed \u201cshelf\u201d formed by -helix 2 and Phe-325. only binding of (GlcNAc)2Man3 in -helix 2 yielded appreciable chemical shift perturbations in -helix 2. this suggests that perturbations in this region may be due to the GlcNAc moieties, possibly in conjunction with their -(1,4) linkages to the trimannose core. the number of chemical shifts affected by ligand binding in all cases is greater than was expected based on the size of the canonical binding site in the crystal. Man9GlcNAc binding results in no chemical shift changes for residues in the region thought to compose a \u201cshelf\u201d formed by -helix 2 and Phe-325. -helix 2 is involved in binding to (GlcNAc)2Man3 (and possibly to the smaller glycan fragments), which is in good agreement with 1K9J structure. the three sugar fragments behaved similarly upon titration, displaying linear chemical shift perturbations and no line broadening as ligand concentration was increased. this behavior is characteristic of fast exchange between free and bound protein on the NMR chemical shift time scale. this behavior suggests that the interaction between the CRD and sugar fragments is weak. binding of Man9GlcNAc caused substantial broadening and disappearance of a number of CRD peaks. binding of Man9GlcNAc caused substantial broadening and disappearance of a number of glycan fragments. this suggests higher affinity binding of Man9GlcNAc compared with sugar fragments. variable signal intensity was only satisfactorily minimized after also raising the temperature from 25 to 37 \u00b0C. per residue 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured in the absence (holo) and presence of 10 mm Man5 to map regions of the CRD where dynamics is altered upon ligand binding. asterisks indicate residues in the ca2+ binding loops. holo-CRD and man5-bound CRD are not observed due to fast relaxation or exchange. asterisks indicate residues in the primary Ca2+ binding loops. no changes were observed for residues in -helix 2 (thought to form the extended glycan-binding \u201cshelf\u201d) upon the addition of Man5. we also see increased transverse relaxation rates for residues 269\u2013272. the holo-CRD is only slightly longer than the expected value of 8.55 ns. this deviation from the ideal value is not large enough to infer oligomerization of the holo-CRD. no conformational changes have been observed in any published crystal structures for DC-SIGNR CRD upon ligand binding. complex carbohydrate binding events that occur within the human immune system are vital to healthy immune function and proper host responses to a wide variety of pathogens. a number of transmembrane human lectins are capable of binding multiple ligands via discrete binding sites and can transduce different intracellular signals through the same receptor molecule. a number of transmembrane human lectins are capable of binding multiple ligands via discrete binding sites and can transduce different intracellular signals through the same receptor molecule. in -helix 2 were preferentially engaged during binding of (GlcNAc)2Man3. this region does not appear to interact with (GlcNAc)2Man3 in the binding site. the data suggest that the use of small glycans as models should be treated with caution. c-type lectin TC14 has shown that the nonregular sequences in the C-type lectin domain are rigid (61) however, just as primary sequences and ligand specificity for the C-type lectin family are many and varied, so too could be the dynamic properties of the assorted domain family members. previous studies have suggested that ca2+ binding in the secondary loop is enhanced by glycan binding (43) this type of behavior could explain the reduction in T2 as we go from holo-form to Man5-bound form. this type of behavior could explain the reduction in T2 as we go from holo-form to Man5-bound form. binding of this glycan was unique in that NMR spectra displayed severe line broadening. the larger, higher affinity Man9GlcNAc could restrict the motions of the CRD more than the smaller, low affinity Man5. but more work is needed to improve the solution behavior of this complex. man9GlcNAc binding did result in broadening of signals. this inherent flexibility may enhance the ability of DC-SIGNR to accommodate a variety of ligands. all four glycans caused perturbation of protein regions near the principal glycan binding site, namely the primary Ca2+-binding loop and -sheets 6 and 7. however, each glycan had a unique set of additional perturbations in -helices 1 and 2, the loop region consisting of residues 382\u2013385, and the secondary Ca2+-binding loop. this region does not appear to interact with Man9GlcNAc. the binding site in the DC-SIGNR CRD may have evolved around this ligand and does not need to rearrange significantly in order to accommodate it. the level of dynamics data relating to these carbohydrate-binding proteins is limited. this exchange could be compatible with the association/dissociation kinetics of Ca2+ ions or Man5, although there are no existing data in this area. previous studies have suggested that Ca2+ binding in the secondary loop is enhanced by glycan binding (43) this type of behavior could explain the reduction in T2 as we go from holo-form to Man5-bound form. binding of Ca2+ and Man5 reduces the rate of conformational interconversion of this region. ligand binding could alter the orientation of the CRD with respect to the neck. ligand binding could alter the orientation of the CRD with respect to the neck. bound DC-SIGNR CRD do not suggest conformational rearrangement upon ligand binding. glycans bind to multiple binding sites or experience multivalent binding. only a single binding mode was observed in crystals of (GlcNAc)2Man3. different binding modes for the four glycans support the structural plasticity proposed for the lectin family. each glycan had a unique set of additional perturbations in -helices 1 and 2, the loop region consisting of residues 382\u2013385, and the secondary Ca2+-binding loop. the majority of residues in -helix 2 were preferentially engaged during binding of (GlcNAc)2Man3. binding of larger, branched physiological ligands should be treated with caution and demonstrate that solution state NMR is highly accommodating, informative, and essential for the design of drug molecules that inhibit binding of large, disease-associated carbohydrates. the three glycan fragments displayed 1:1 binding to a single binding site with similar, weak affinities. the apo-CRD appeared to be very dynamic, probably exchanging between a broad ensemble of conformations. this rapid relaxation could suggest direct binding and thus more hindered micro- to millisecond motion in these regions. this exchange could be compatible with the association/dissociation kinetics of Ca2+ ions or Man5. ligand binding could alter the orientation of the CRD with respect to the neck. ligand binding could alter the orientation of the CRD with respect to the neck. ligand binding could alter the orientation of the CRD with respect to the neck. the larger, higher affinity Man9GlcNAc could restrict the motions of the CRD more than the smaller, low affinity Man5. however, more work is needed to improve the solution behavior of this complex. glycans bind to multiple binding sites or experience multivalent binding. significant portions of the C-type lectin domain do not adopt regular secondary structure. ligand binding properties of the C-type lectin domains are located within these nonregular regions. a number of transmembrane human lectins are capable of binding multiple ligands via discrete binding sites. in -helices 1 and 2, the loop region consisting of residues 382\u2013385, and the secondary Ca2+-binding loop. the majority of residues in -helix 2 were preferentially engaged during binding of (GlcNAc)2Man3. this region does not appear to interact with (GlcNAc)2Man3 in the binding site. the level of dynamics data relating to these carbohydrate-binding proteins is surprisingly limited. diversity in the dynamic characteristics of these proteins may play an important role in defining ligand interactions and specificity. relaxation data also highlighted changes in the CRD distal to the proposed glycan binding site. previous studies have suggested that Ca2+ binding in the secondary loop is enhanced by glycan binding (43) this type of behavior could explain the reduction in T2 as we go from holo-form to Man5-bound form. type lectin CLEC5A allude to similar possibilities that dynamic changes in the CRD could contribute to the transmission of conformational information and signaling beyond the target binding site. binding of this glycan was unique in that NMR spectra displayed severe line broadening, which could be due to extensive micro- to millisecond dynamics in the CRD. a single binding mode was observed in crystals of (GlcNAc)2Man3 with DC-SIGNR. no non-linear chemical shift perturbations or broadening was observed. the linear chemical shift perturbations fit very well to a one-site binding model."}
