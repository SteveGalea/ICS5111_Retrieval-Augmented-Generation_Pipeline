{"summary": "pneumonia kills more children worldwide than any other disease (425, 528) in the united states, children more commonly survive pneumonia, but even in such advantaged countries pneumonia is the most common reason for children to be hospitalized (566). a fifth of those children need to be in the intensive care unit (ICU), and a third require mechanical ventilation (228). pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory tract infection that is more than acute, more than lower respiratory tract, and more than infection. the pathogenesis of this disease is driven by the host response. pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory tract infection that is more than acute, more than acute, and more than infection. pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis (320, 516). it causes the majority of cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). pneumonia is the cause of ARDS when the lungs contain fluid. the advent of antibiotics was profoundly important, dramatically reducing pneumonia mortality rates in the us during the mid-20th century. Vaccines also decrease rates of pneumonia in populations in which they are adopted, modestly but importantly (154, 174, 175) changes among microbes infecting the respiratory tract influence pneumonia biology. microbes that have recently become recognized as important causes of pneumonia may represent a recent emergence of knowledge more than of microbes. rhinoviruses C and D, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human metapneumoviruses, and more (230). plasmid-mediated colistin resistance is being passed among Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pneumonia agents. there are few unifying principles to the types of microbe that cause pneumonia. these diverse etiologic agents encode a wide variety of microbe-specific virulence pathways that influence the likelihood that respiratory infection will cause pneumonia. readers may wish to consult other reviews specific to relevant microbes. microbes in the lung exceed a host\u2019s capacity to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. for these processes to be effective they must provide adequate levels of immune resistance and tissue resilience (407) the advent of antibiotics was profoundly important, dramatically reducing pneumonia mortality rates in the US during the mid-20th century (336) zoonoses cause rare pneumonias but get considerable attention because of their bioterrorism potential. microbes that have emerged as pneumonia threats in recent decades include Legionella, Pneumocystis, hantavirus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus. the microbes causing pneumonia are extraordinarily numerous and extremely varied. the agents identified include many different viruses and bacteria. the microbes do not appear to share any particular characteristics. a potentially responsible microbe fails to be detected in about one-fifth of childhood pneumonias and more than half of adult pneumonias. the degree to which it or they are truly causal is uncertain. most people who encounter these microbes do not develop pneumonia and do not get seriously ill. innate immunity involves an elaborate network of cells and signals that actively function to eliminate invading organisms. defense also includes anatomical barriers that restrict the deposition of microbes within the respiratory tract. innate immunity involves an elaborate network of cells and signals that actively function to eliminate invading organisms. mediators include multifactorial cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, antimicrobial substances, opsonins, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, adhesion molecules, receptors, apoptotic factors, and more. this response involves the recruitment and/or activation of numerous cell types, some of which have only recently become appreciated in the setting of lung immunity. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages. AM apoptosis is a specialized pathway of immune resistance, while other macrophage death pathways are detrimental to the host. the antimicrobial effector functions of AMs can be sufficient to control low pathogen burdens without recruiting additional cells (2, 111). rophage NF-B activation and cytokine elaboration are altered for prolonged periods of time after the resolution of prior respiratory infections (211), suggestive of trained immunity (363). the degree to which such alterations in AM responsiveness may improve or worsen antimicrobial resistance, and mechanisms responsible for altering these macrophage behaviors demand further attention. in the alveoli, surfactant proteins (SP) A and D, synthesized by the alveolar epithelial type II cells, have critical roles in immune resistance. in the upper respiratory tract and conducting airways of the lung, a prominent feature is mucociliary clearance. a prominent feature is mucociliary clearance. a wide gamut of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents are enabled. epithelial-specific genetic targeting of NF-B activity downstream of many of these receptors (408) is necessary and sufficient for the elaboration of innate lung defense (73, 74, 406, 554, 555) cytokine stimulation of epithelial cells is a requirement for maximum epithelial responses in some settings. cytokine stimulation of epithelial cells requires macrophage activity (392), which can occur in direct response to pneumococcus (392, 406). IL-22-dependent protection includes its capacity to activate epithelial cells via the transcription factor STAT3. IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) can activate epithelial STAT3 to promote induction of the chemokine CXCL5 (495) the epithelium can also signal directly to neutrophils by producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and secreted and transmembrane 1 proteins (246, 465, 554). ly rely on the activity of epithelial cells (82, 119, 284) to control pulmonary immune resistance. epithelial stimulation is safely tolerated in vivo (11) and confers significant protection against bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. apoptotic neutrophils are immunoregulatory, enhancing the resolution of inflammation. the molecules identified are for illustrative purpose and do not represent an exhaustive presentation. the known biological mechanisms governing lung neutrophil recruitment are vast. the primary means of neutrophil-mediated killing are 1) phagocytosis, during which phagolysosomal fusion exposes ingested organisms to reactive oxygen species (via NADPH-oxidase activity) and acidity; 2) degranulation, during which granules release toxic factors such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), gelatinase B (MMP9), cathepsins, defensins, and ation release the chemokine CXCL10, which subsequently enhances neutrophil activity and recruitment through its receptor CXCR3 (213). neutrophil production of chemokines like CXCL10 and CXCL2 may contribute to \u201cswarming\u201d behavior of neutrophils (253), in which neutrophil activation amplifies the local recruitment of neutrophils within the air spaces of infected lungs (FIGURE 3). neutrophils release the chemokine CCL17, which recruits iNKT cells to the interstitium. this is essential to optimal defense in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutrophils can recruit lymphocytes for adaptive immunity purposes. phagocytes can produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-, and IL-12. they can be distinguished from resident cells by a variety of differentially expressed surface markers. the role of recruited macrophages in maintaining immune resistance in the lungs is receiving considerable interest. natural killer (NK) cells represent one type of innate lymphocyte enriched in lung tissue. patients with genetic mutations causing NK cell deficiency are especially prone to viral infections. NK cells are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models. group 1 including ILC1s and NK cells, group 2 including ILC2s, and 3) group 3 including ILC3s and lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells (461, 462, 519) research into ILCs and lung infection is in early stages. ILC1s do not reside or function within the healthy lung. invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells possess an invariant TCR alpha chain and recognize lipid antigens presented by the MHC-like molecule CD1d (53) iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection (373), although this did not alter immune resistance in this particular setting. B1 cells are a self-renewing B cell population that is a major producer of cross-reactive natural IgM antibodies. the innate response activator (IRA) subset of B1a cells has been shown to reside in the pleural space and migrate to the lung parenchyma in response to E. coli pneumonia. it will be of interest to determine whether and how megakaryocytes in the lung are influenced by, and in turn influence, pneumonia. it will be of interest to determine whether and how megakaryocytes in the lung and the differentiation of stemlike precursors into megakaryocytes are influenced by, and in turn influence, pneumonia. pneumonia elicits robust hepatic transcriptome remodeling within hours of pneumonia. regulation of hepatic gene programs guiding APP synthesis is attributed to multiple transcription factors (427), including STAT3, which was originally known as the \u201cacute phase response factor\u201d before it was cloned in the early 1990s. increased mortality and impaired immune resistance in mice lacking hepatocyte RelA and STAT3 (200, 201, 403) demonstrating the physiological significance of lung-liver communication. hepatic acute phase serum can enhance opsonophagocytosis (233) hepatic activity is essential to this blood-borne defense during pneumonia. regulation of metal homeostasis may also be an important form of immune resistance provided by the liver. hepcidin, which is largely driven by IL-6-dependent STAT3 activity in the liver (361), limits iron availability by controlling its absorption in the intestines (362) hepatic gene changes were associated with increased plasma cholesterol. this increase was shown to abrogate pneumolysin-dependent alveolar macrophage necrosis. this suggests that acute phase exudate in the alveolar space directly impairs pneumococcal virulence. recombinant G-CSF alone is sufficient to elicit increases in circulating G-CSF, blood neutrophils, and bone marrow granulopoiesis (447) this is consistent with the notion that lung-derived G-CSF is decompartmentalized to access the bone marrow during pneumonia. the anatomy and distribution of phagocytes within the spleen enable reticuloendothelial clearance of circulating pathogens (324) this is essential for controlling systemic defense and inflammation during pneumonia. the spleen has essential roles in adaptive immune responses, and these may contribute to local lung defense. depletion of gut microbiota with antibiotics impairs K. pneumoniae clearance in the lungs in association with reduced pulmonary cytokine responses and impaired ROS synthesis by AMs. similar immunodeficiency is observed in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia following gut microbiome depletion. broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment ablates intestinal microbiota and significantly increases the number of viable bacteria recovered from the lungs. hyperleptinemia, a hallmark of obesity, may increase risk of pneumonia. higher leptin levels associate with greater pneumonia risk in nonhospitalized adults. higher circulating leptin content in mice, elevated by diverse strategies, can compromise innate immunity in the lungs. febrile-range hyperthermia has numerous consequences on pulmonary inflammation and immunity (186), including elevated neutrophil accumulation and earlier clearance of K. pneumoniae from the lungs (419) fever may serve as a systemic mechanism of brain-derived pulmonary defense. alveolar macrophages AMs are professional phagocytes that reside on the surface of the lower respiratory tract. they represent an initial line of leukocytic antimicrobial defense. studies in mouse models indicate that AMs are yolk sac-derived and extremely long-lived (177, 229, 349) apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). the antimicrobial effector functions of AMs can be sufficient to control low pathogen burdens without recruiting additional cells (2, 111). During pneumonia, macrophages have multiple critical roles in protecting the host against infection (immune resistance) and against injury (tissue resilience) emerging area of focus related to AMs is release of cytokines and other immunomodulating agents within membrane-bound vesicles such as exosomes and microparticles. IL-36, which is essential for efficient resistance against bacterial pneumonia in mouse models, is one such AM product (267) the importance of ciliary action is highlighted by the lung disease. airway ciliated cells are more heterogeneous than previously recognized. subsets of airway ciliated cells have immunomodulatory roles that extend beyond the mechanical clearance of mucus (529) a wide gamut of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents is necessary and sufficient for the elaboration of innate lung defense. several studies in genetic mouse models support toll-like receptor signaling as an important source of immune activation (118, 180, 332, 367, 388, 413) in vitro stimulation of epithelial cells with Streptococcus pneumoniae fails to elicit an NF-B response. stimulation with pneumonic airway lining fluid robustly activates this transcription factor in an IL-1- and TNF-dependent manner (406) the ability of epithelial cells to respond to AMs does not preclude epithelial activation by other cytokines and cells. the epithelium can signal directly to neutrophils by producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) additional epithelial-specific products induced by lung infection include CCL20 (466, 555), short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) (292), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and many others (246) which confer local immune resistance. neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles during pneumonia. neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles. affector roles include activities that enhance antimicrobial activities by other cells. the known biological mechanisms governing lung neutrophil recruitment are vast, with many more almost certainly remaining to be discovered. many local signals coalesce to drive this response, such as pathogen recognition (by PRRs), transcriptional remodeling of responding resident cells (by PRRs), production of early-response cytokines and growth factors (which further stimulate neighboring and remote cells), generation of a chemotactic or haptotactic gradient. phagocytosis exposes ingested organisms to reactive oxygen species (via NADPH-oxidase activity) and acidity. granules release toxic factors such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), gelatinase B (MMP9), cathepsins, defensins, and other antimicrobial proteins into the phagosome and/or extracellular space. the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET neutrophil production of chemokines like CXCL10 and CXCL2 may contribute to \u201cswarming\u201d behavior of neutrophils (253), in which neutrophil activation amplifies the local recruitment of neutrophils within the air spaces of infected lungs. in some cases, neutrophils also can be a source of IL-17 (60, 533), a cytokine driving protective immunity through the induction of IL-17 (60, 533) neutrophils release chemokine CCL17, which recruits iNKT cells to the interstitium. this is essential to optimal defense in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutrophils can recruit lymphocytes for adaptive immunity purposes. neutrophils serve as a consequence and cause of acute pulmonary inflammation. multiple studies support an essential role for recruited macrophages in maintaining immune resistance in the lungs. the role of innate lymphocytes in the context of pneumonia biology is receiving considerable interest. innate lymphocytes are innate with regards to pathogen recognition. patients with genetic mutations causing NK cell deficiency are especially prone to viral infections. the direct requirement of NK cells for maximum antiviral immunity has been observed in animal models. NK cells are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models of pneumonia. ILCs are devoid of the known lineage markers associated with adaptive lymphoid cells. research into ILCs and lung infection is in early stages. despite their relatively low abundance, they can play important roles. invariant natural killer T cells possess an invariant TCR alpha chain and recognize lipid antigens presented by the MHC-like molecule CD1d (53) iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection (373), although this did not alter immune resistance in this particular setting. B1 cells are a self-renewing B cell population that is a major producer of cross-reactive natural IgM antibodies. the innate response activator (IRA) subset of B1a cells has been shown to reside in the pleural space and migrate to the lung parenchyma. these cells then provide a protective GM-CSF-dependent IgM response (530) s AMs are professional phagocytes that reside on the surface of the lower respiratory tract. they represent an initial line of leukocytic antimicrobial defense. studies in mouse models indicate that AMs are yolk sac-derived and extremely long-lived. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). both TRAIL and apoptosis are required for efficient clearance of bacteria in the lungs (35, 468). AM death by pathways other than apoptosis can be stimulated by agents of pneumonia. AMs use RelA from the NF-B transcription factor family to dispatch numerous cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1, chemokines, IL-6, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), all of which are important for eliciting lung innate immunity (61, 171, 173, 194, 239, 240, 392, 408, 413) macrophages are important as antimicrobial effector cells and as sources of cytokines in the lungs. the profound influence of AMs on pneumonia outcome is further supported by reports of targeted disruption of macrophage function, either pharmacologically or genetically, which impairs innate defense in mouse models of lung infection. gene targeting of MUC5B but not MUC5AC has been shown to render mice more susceptible to bacterial infection. CFTR mutations, which compromise the fluidity of mucus in cystic fibrosis patients (191) also underscore the importance of mucus in lung immunity given the prevalence of lung infections. myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a central adapter protein for much but not all TLR signaling. it is essential for pulmonary immune resistance as evidenced by profound susceptibility to lung infections in individuals with genetic MyD88 deficiency. the ability of epithelial cells to respond to AMs does not preclude epithelial activation by other cytokines and cells. IL-22-dependent protection includes its capacity to activate epithelial cells via the transcription factor STAT3 to produce the antimicrobial siderophore binding protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2) (23), which is itself required for maximum lung immunity (24, 66, 141) additional epithelial-specific products induced by lung infection include CCL20 (466, 555), short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) (292), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) (470), and many others (246) which can confer local immune resistance. the capacity of epithelial cells to control the immunological tone of the lungs is further exemplified by studies showing that their neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles during pneumonia. effectsor roles include microbial elimination via phagocytosis and degranulation as well as NET formation. neutrophil numbers that can exceed the total circulating pool are microns away at the start of infection. neutrophil numbers that can exceed the total circulating pool are microns away at the start of infection. neutrophils exert an expansive repertoire of intra- and extracellular antimicrobial activities. gene deletion of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in mice increases vulnerability to lung infections with S. pneumoniae (179), whereas S. pneumoniae lacking endonuclease A are less efficient at evading NETs. neutrophils also function in a governing capacity, producing cytokines, chemokines, and other factors that coordinate the ongoing immune functions in the lung (226). induction of CXCL5, CXCL1, G-CSF, and enhanced phagocytic antimicrobial defense. emigrated but not circulating neutrophils represent a prominent source of IFN-. neutrophils can enhance macrophage-mediated immunity by serving as a source of TRAIL, which drives antimicrobial apoptotic responses. neutrophils may be the exclusive resident leukocyte of the airspaces. but they do not represent the only macrophage population driving innate immunity. a distinct population of recruited bone marrow-derived macrophages can have an indispensable role in pulmonary innate immunity. in mice challenged with K. pneumoniae, recruited monocytes were identified as the prominent source of TNF-, contributing to the lung recruitment of ILC3s and IL-17-mediated defense (548). innate lymphocytes bear functional similarities to the B and T lymphocytes well recognized for their roles in adaptive immune responses. GM1 exhibit increased lung bacterial burdens and mortality upon infection with S. pneumoniae (125) NK cells also are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models of pneumonia. NK cells may also function at the interface of viral and bacterial pneumonias by limiting the likelihood of superinfection. ILC2s are present under unchallenged homeostatic conditions (152), although their functional contributions to immune resistance are uncertain. ILC2s help repair and regenerate injured lung tissue (44, 279, 333), but ILC2-mediated repair after pneumonia specifically is presently speculative. iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection. mice lacking these cells are more susceptible to lung infections with K. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae. roles of MAIT cells during bacterial pneumonia have yet to be demonstrated. platelets contribute to innate immunity as well, with multiple potential connections to pneumonia (46, 550) platelets and associated platelet GTPases and adhesion molecules enhance LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment in the lung and host defense during Klebsiella pneumonia (98, 99, 375), demonstrating roles in immune resistance. the liver has long been appreciated for its role in mounting the acute phase response (APR) there are now dozens of known [and likely many more unknown (403)] APPs, which are functionally diverse, and primarily expressed in the liver (148) cytokine signals from the lung elicit a rapid hepatic response to remodel the blood proteome. failure to mount a liver APR is associated with increased mortality and impaired immune resistance. c transcription factor targeting invovlves decreased deposition of complement component 3 (C3) on the surface of pneumococci (403) a role for pneumonia-induced C3 expression is also supported by a recent study showing that IL-22 increases hepatic and serum C3 levels to a degree that is sufficient to increase its bacterial deposition as well as pulmonary defense. regulation, hemostasis, toxin inhibition, microbial starvation, and more. secreted APPs represent only a fraction of the many hepatic gene changes constituting the acute phase response (8, 403). the importance of liver responses for lung defense demands consideration of non-APP functions. granulopoiesis in the marrow requires the lung to function in an endocrine capacity, much like it does with the liver to elicit the APR. the most prominent is G-CSF (311), the primary intermediate through which pneumonic lungs trigger bone marrow responses. pulmonary G-CSF delivery can also significantly amplify alveolar neutrophil recruitment. genetic targeting of the G-CSF receptor impairs clearance of P. aeruginosa in mouse lungs. this is associated with reduced survival and dramatic decreases in circulating and lung-recruited neutrophils. neutrophils may predispose to pneumococcal pneumonia because of defects in T cell-independent antibodies from the spleen. neutrophils are produced by splenic B cells requiring neutrophils as helper cells. the intestinal mucosa is an immunologically rich environment, shaped by interactions among microbiota, invading pathogens, and host immune functions. pulmonary defense is evident in the setting of viral pneumonia. microbiome ablation impairs immune responses reliant on inflammasome activity. reducing the presence of potentially infectious agents in the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems of vulnerable patients can decrease rates of pneumonia and death in the ICU. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses (59, 262). evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that obesity per se increases risk of community acquired pneumonia. other extrapulmonary influences on intrapulmonary immune responses. a specific polymorphism in angiotensin converting enzyme reduces substance P and bradykinin, both of which drive the cough reflex (524), also consistent with the notion that airway reflex sensitivity contributes to pulmonary defense. the molecules identified are for illustrative purpose and do not represent an exhaustive presentation. NF-B and STAT3 are particularly important for hepatic acute phase changes. this response requires a combination of early-response cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-1) with IL-6. failure to mount a liver APR is associated with increased mortality and impaired immune resistance. reduced opsonophagocytosis after hepatic transcription factor targeting invovlves decreased deposition of complement component 3 (C3) on the surface of pneumococci (403) a role for pneumonia-induced C3 expression is also supported by a recent study showing that IL-22 increases hepatic and serum C3 levels to a degree that is sufficient to increase its bacterial deposition. additional relevant APP functions may include protease regulation, hemostasis, toxin inhibition, microbial starvation, and more. secreted APPs represent only a fraction of the many hepatic gene changes constituting the acute phase response (8, 403). the importance of liver responses for lung defense demands consideration of non-APP functions. resistance requires both resident and recruited leukocytes in the lungs. this shift from homeostatic granulopoiesis to \"emergency\" granulopoiesis in the marrow requires the lung to function in an endocrine capacity. the most prominent is G-CSF (311), the primary intermediate through which lungs trigger bone marrow responses. CSF alone is sufficient to elicit increases in circulating G-CSF, blood neutrophils, and bone marrow granulopoiesis (447), consistent with the notion that lung-derived G-CSF is decompartmentalized to access the bone marrow during pneumonia. genetic targeting of the G-CSF receptor impairs clearance of P. aeruginosa in mice challenged with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutropenia may predispose to pneumococcal pneumonia because of defects in T cell-independent antibodies from the spleen. the intestinal mucosa is an immunologically rich environment, containing a microbial landscape shaped by interactions among microbiota, invading pathogens, and host immune functions. ficiency is also observed in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia following gut microbiome depletion. broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment ablates intestinal microbiota and significantly increases the number of viable bacteria recovered from the lungs. microbiome ablation impairs immune responses reliant on inflammasome activity. adiponectin is another adipokine with inflammation-regulating properties that may influence pulmonary immune resistance. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses (59, 262), but whether or how this factor directly contributes to pneumonia biology is currently unclear. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses. pneumonia incidence has been shown to correlate with cough reflex sensitivity (355) among patients with mixed primary neurological disorders the incidence of ARDS is significantly greater in those lacking cough and/or gag reflexes (204). a recent meta-analysis indicated markedly higher pneumonia incidence in subjects with a specific polymorphism. the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the last half of the 20th century emphasized the importance of cellular immunity in immune defense of the lungs. the adoption of microbe-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is capable of fighting respiratory infection in inbred animals (182, 232, 558), similar to the transfer of protection achieved with antibodies. cellular immunity also protects the lungs against pneumonia. adaptive immunity is remodeled by prior microbial infections. the establishment of heterotypic immunity and of resident memory. lungs that have experienced prior infections are different from naive lungs that have not. those born before 1968 were likely first infected with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinins (HAs) from phylogenetic group 1 (which includes H1, H2, and H5 HAs) those born after that date were more likely to be first infected by influenza viruses with group 2 HAs (which includes H3 and H7 HAs) adults can be sufficient to protect mice against severe viral or bacterial pneumonia. a population first experiencing the reassortant H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009 (463) patients with greater circulating numbers of CD8+ T cells recognizing epitopes conserved in that coming influenza virus showed less symptoms during their naturally acquired infections with that virus (463) responsive T cells in experienced hosts are more numerous, localized to the right place, able to respond more quickly, and prone to becoming multifunctional. some heterotypic antibodies in human blood can be neutralizing, preventing viral infection of cells. other heterotypic antibodies direct immune effector activities. memory CD4+ T cells established by prior respiratory infections are superior to primary effectors in their protection of the respiratory tract. the expansion of such memory CD4+ T cells in the infected lungs requires IL-6 (474) similar phenomena apply to bacterial pneumonias. ident Memory Cells are localized depots of immune memory within the respiratory tract that specifically protect these tissues against respiratory infection. the best recognized such structures are the tertiary lymphoid organs of the upper airways, the tonsils and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (443) and the variable amounts of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) in the lower airways (412). these sites are sites of local antibody production, as well as sources of memory B cells and plasma a population of lung-resident memory T cells retained in the tissue rather than recirculating with a lung-homing propensity. the lung-derived cells provided better protection as measured by weight loss, survival, and viral burdens. the resolution of lower respiratory infection can seed the lungs with TRM cells that remain local. CD4+ memory T cells are found 1\u20132 mo later in the previously infected lobe rather than contralateral lobes. the previously infected lobe is significantly more protected against infection by pneumococci of a different serotype compared with contralateral lobes. antigen-independent polyclonal activation of human lung-derived T cells (401, 433, 487, 488) stimulates the coexpression of many cytokines (e.g., IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 together) thus the human lung contains a preponderance of TRM cells, which likely have specificity for respiratory pathogens and exert multifunctional roles. the development of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs after recovery from influenza infection (572), suggesting a requirement for this costimulation pathway. the fundamental biology of lung TRM cells remains poorly defined and presents particularly great promise for improving our understanding of pneumonia defense. typic Adaptive Immunity refers to adaptive immunity directed against a microbe that is similar but not identical to the microbe originally establishing immunological memory. healthy young adult humans probably have some degree of heterotypic immune memory against all of the most common causes of pneumonia. those born before 1968 were likely first infected with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinins (HAs) healthy young adults are experimentally infected with influenza virus or RSV. heterotypic antibodies in their blood before experimental infection correlate with their viral burden and symptoms after infection (25, 231) in seronegative individuals who have not seen a particular influenza virus before, those with greater numbers of influenza-responsive CD4+ T cells in their blood before infection (FIGURE 6) have less severe infection as measured by viral burden and symptoms after infection (537) responsive T cells in experienced hosts are more numerous, localized to the right place, and prone to becoming multifunctional. heterotypic antibodies against the conserved stalk region of influenza HA trigger a respiratory burst in phagocytes. heterotypic antibodies against the conserved stalk region of influenza HA trigger a respiratory burst in phagocytes and provide heterotypic defense against respiratory infection that is Fc receptor dependent. human blood from at least three continents consistently contains IgG antibodies against diverse pneumococcal proteins. pneumococcus-recognizing antibodies found in the blood after pneumococcal infection are not necessarily capable of mediating heterotypic protection. cellular immunity makes many contributions to heterotypic protection of the lungs (FIGURE 6). IL-17 stimulates host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi in the lungs. both IL-17 and CD4+ T cells from the spleens of such mice are necessary for heterotypic protection against pneumococcus in the lungs. CR specific to influenza HA were used to restrict analyses to antigen-specific cells. memory CD4+ T cells were collected from the lungs or the spleen of mice with a fully resolved influenza virus infection. the lung-derived memory cells were then found exclusively in the lungs, whereas the spleen-derived cells were found in the recipient mice. the lobe with TRM cells demonstrates far superior lung defense against virulent pneumococci compared with the contralateral lobes without TRM cells. the fact that depletion of CD4+ cells compromises such defense (459) highlights a TRM cell role. thus lung TRM cells protect against diverse types of respiratory pathogens. memory T cells begin accumulating in human lungs as early as infancy (487, 488) cytokine expression from human lung TRM cells stimulated by presentation of microbial antigens has not been reported. pneumococcus presentation to mouse lung TRM cells (459) induces the MHCII-dependent expression of a wide variety of cytokines. the development of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs after influenza infection requires signaling from Notch, low levels of T-bet, and the IL-15 receptor. the maintenance of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lung requires signaling from notch, low levels of T-bet, and the IL-15 receptor (208, 302) infection with influenza virus is capable of altering the phenotypes of alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in the mouse lung for months afterwards (107, 247, 394) the degrees to which BALT, innate lymphocyte accumulation, and such remodeling of epithelial cells and macrophages reflects chronic inflammation, trained immunity (363), aberrant repair, or all of the above. anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are sufficient and necessary to reduce innate immune responses and inflammatory lung injury during pneumonia (94, 170, 195, 505, 507) this comes with the risk of overly blunting immune resistance and exacerbating infection (507) efferocytosis is a complex and tightly regulated process known as efferocytosis (192, 193) efferocytosis steers the environment away from an accumulation of necrotic cells. efferocytosis actively reprograms AMs to release a suite of anti-inflammatory mediators. these factors elicit resilience responses, including but not limited to inflammatory cytokine regulation, epithelial repair, and efferocytosis itself the identification of sessile macrophages challenges existing paradigms of alveolar macrophage biology. only a fraction of alveolar macrophages are recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. bronchoalveolar lavage may have specialized roles in lung resilience during pulmonary inflammation. mechanisms of STAT3-mediated epithelial protection likely involve, at least in part, the induction of gene programs that inhibit apoptosis. protective STAT3-dependent signals require precise regulation given the potential for the development of epithelial adenocarcinoma (286). ing ETS Transcription Factor (SPDEF) is best recognized for driving mucus metaplasia (68) but a nonpathological role of SPDEF is to limit inflammatory gene expression downstream of MyD88 and TRIF (264) some mucus proteins exhibit anti-inflammatory roles in the pneumonic lung (254), as highlighted by protective immunosuppressive effects of MUC1. ances to neutrophils, also accumulate in pneumonic lungs, where they limit immunopathology through synthesis of IL-10 and enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Recruited cells derived from lymphoid progenitors can also limit inflammatory injury in the lungs. NK cells can also be tissue protective, producing IL-22 to mediate epithelial repair in response to viral or bacterial lung infections. glucocorticoids derived from the HPA axis are quintessentially anti-inflammatory. the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids on CXCL5 expression and neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs involve circadian rhythms in airway epithelial cells. anti-inflammatory 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7 nAChR) on alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. this is further supported by enhanced injury in mice lacking 7 nAChR itself. adrenalectomy impairs circadian suppression of airway epithelial cells and exaggerates the lung CXCL5 response. APPs including but not limited to antiproteases and those regulating metal homeostasis confer liver-dependent tissue protection in pneumonic lungs. extrapulmonary organ injury is a common sequela of severe pneumonia, posing concern for sepsis secondary to pulmonary infections. ant proteins A and D (117), PARP (295), EGF (114), Bcl2 (210), and p53 (87) acute injury to the kidneys and brain is also associated with sepsis. bacterial growth and macrophage necroptosis within the mycocardium leads to acute injury and prolonged scarring (56, 159, 417) the activation state of AMs is tightly regulated by their microenvironment (211) in a state of baseline homeostasis, engagement of CD200R, TGF-R, and IL-10R by their corresponding ligands at the epithelial surface is an important negative regulator of alveolar macrophage activity. alternatively activated (M2) AMs generate anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and IL-1RA, and the size of this cell population has been shown to pro-resolving lipid mediators elicit resilience responses, including but not limited to inflammatory cytokine regulation, epithelial repair, and efferocytosis itself (28). a population of nonmotile macrophages in the airspaces appear to have a major influence on tissue resilience (534) the presence of tight junctions and the expression of epithelial Na+ channels (e.g., ENaC and Na+-K+-ATPase) inhibit the airspace liquid accumulation characteristic of pneumonia. these surface proteins are dynamically regulated by host factors such as cAMP agonists, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and TRAIL. disruption of these pathways can enhance acute lung injury. LIF is induced in lung epithelial cells in response to infection (144, 405, 496). it is necessary and sufficient to activate lung epithelial STAT3 (409). the benefits of LIF are solely attributable to increased tissue resilience. exudate macrophages have been identified as an important source of IL-1RA-dependent prevention of epithelial apoptosis and inflammatory injury in mice with pneumonia caused by LPS or K. pneumoniae (195). macrophages support the growth of alveolar epithelial cells and of lung epithelial \u201cpneumospheres\u201d in vitro (279) Recruited ILC2s can limit immunopathology during pneumonia. NK cells can also be tissue protective, producing IL-22 to mediate epithelial repair in response to viral or bacterial lung infections. so resident and recruited cell types enhance intrapulmonary resilience during pneumonia. neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs involve circadian rhythms in airway epithelial cells. adrenalectomy impairs circadian suppression of airway epithelial cells. adrenalectomy promotes inflammatory injury following intrapulmonary challenges. anti-inflammatory role of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells also suggests neural regulation of lung immunity (49) some of the APPs produced in the liver in response to pulmonary infection serve to counter inflammatory injury. some of the APPs produced in the liver in response to pulmonary infection serve to counter inflammatory injury. extrapulmonary organ injury is a common sequela of severe pneumonia. hepatic acute phase changes occur in response to lung infections in mice (403, 404) ER stress and antiapoptotic pathways induced by STAT3 and RelA in hepatocytes are examples of inducible tissue resilience outside of the lungs. a microbiome in the lung has become appreciated due to culture-independent techniques for detecting, identifying, and quantifying bacteria (105) bacteria in the lungs of healthy individuals are likely transients that represent a balanced equilibrium of incoming bacteria with bacterial elimination. in healthy individuals, the microbiota in the lung are similar to that of the mouth. microbes in the respiratory tract microbiome can limit or favor growth of the causative agents of pneumonia (105, 306, 448, 450, 535), a feature that may differentiate the bacteria that cause pneumonia from other bacteria of the normal respiratory tract microbiome. a change in how pneumonia is approached is motivated by the inspiring successes from the cardiovascular community. both pneumonia and infarction are acute events with disastrous consequences. infarction is attacked with blood-thinners and anticoagulants that prevent or eliminate clots. but so much more is done to address the underlying chronic disease predisposing to acute infarctions. about half of children hospitalized with pneumonia have recognizable underlying conditions, especially premature birth or asthma, while the other half do not (228). a large fraction of aging adults suffer from one or more of these chronic conditions, tilting the demographics of pneumonia towards the aging group. the majority of pneumonia cases occur in older subjects, most of whom have recognized risk factors. both the old and young have impaired immune responses to pulmonary pathogens. the combination of poorer immune clearance and increased alveolar pathogen burden potently increases age-associated risks for developing pneumonia. the chronic inflammatory milieu of aging induces multiple changes that contribute to increased pneumonia risk. chronic inflammation increases pathogen adhesion to host cells (92), induces tolerance of TLRs (107), impairs monocyte pathogen clearance (399) and blunts pulmonary innate immune responses to S. pneumoniae (203). short-term exposure to tobacco smoke disrupts airway mucociliary clearance, alters interferon response to viral pathogens, and attenuates alveolar macrophage, natural killer cell, and dendritic cell responses to pathogens (464). chronic exposures to cigarette smoke substantially derail antibacterial adaptive immunity, diminishing bacteria-specific antibodies (both IgA and IgG in the BAL fluid and IgG in the blood) and skewing bacterial antigen-induced T the AMs of COPD patients adapt to increased oxidative stress by increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. responses of COPD lungs to pathogens are further influenced by alterations in the airway microbiome. this leads to a three- to fourfold increased risk for pneumonia in COPD patients (444, 493) hyperglycemia of diabetes impairs neutrophil chemotaxis (100) and superoxide-mediated antimicrobial effects (383), implying additional mechanisms contributing to susceptibility. impaired neutrophil function during liver disease (40) is in part related to tuftsin deficiency (499) chronic alcohol ingestion results in mitochondrial stress leading to dysfunctional alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and increased risk of ARDS during pneumonia. effects of alcohol consumption on redox imbalance and oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages have been attributed, in part, to diminished glutathione availability (57, 95, 288, 560) risk factors include malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, incomplete vaccination, crowded living conditions, indoor air pollution/parental smoking, prematurity or low birth weight, lack of breastfeeding, and HIV infection. breastfeeding is considered one of the most cost-effective interventions to reduce childhood pneumonia. 1 in 10 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 2 days develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (328) despite efforts such as routine chlorhexidine-based oropharyngeal care, ventilator-associated pneumonias represent a pathophysiology driven by simultaneous disruptions to upper airway barrier protection. many immunological mechanisms for how influenza viruses predispose to secondary infections should also apply to viral infections other than influenza. a plethora of bacterial agents beyond pneumococcus and S. aureus are identified in studies of secondary bacterial infections. aging, tobacco, alcohol or drug abuse, poor air quality, nutritional deficiencies, pulmonary disease, nonpulmonary comorbid conditions, and acute illnesses or exposures interact to increase pneumonia susceptibility. increased efforts to interrupt pneumonia susceptibility in those with comorbidities will help break these feed-forward cycles of comorbidity and pneumonia. comorbidities make people more likely to get pneumonia, and pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities. both the old and young have impaired immune responses to pulmonary pathogens. the combination of poorer immune clearance and increased alveolar pathogen burden potently

susceptibility in those with comorbidities will help break these feed-forward cycles of comorbidity and pneumonia. comorbidities make people more likely to get pneumonia, and pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities. pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities, which yet further accelerates comorbidities. pneumonia requires hospitalization in 10\u201320% of cases. pneumonia incurs 30-day readmission rates of 20% after hospitalization. for Medicare alone, pneumonia costs 13 billion dollars in healthcare per year. ARDS causes a bilateral injury that includes the diffuse influx of protein-rich edema and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space. this includes destruction of surfactant, formation of fibrin-rich intra-alveolar hyaline membranes, and loss of gas-exchanging type 1 pneumocytes. ARDS and sepsis are well-recognized outcomes of pneumonia. pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, often due to ARDS and/or sepsis. ARDS and sepsis have high mortality rates, but they occur in only a fraction of pneumonia cases. fewer than 10% of all elderly patients hospitalized for pneumonia die from this disease. patients with pneumonia appear to have worse long-term mortality rates. long-term effects of pneumonia are manifest in extrapulmonary organs. pneumonia accelerates or precipitates decline in cognition (445) and functional status (224) poor cognitive and functional outcomes following pneumonia may also result from hypoxia and hypoperfusion during acute illness (445) and from ancillary treatments common to severe pneumonia (e.g., benzodiazepine sedatives and bed rest) that appear to increase inflammation, acute delirium, and long-term cognitive risks (376, 378, 393, 532). Increased risks of recurrent and new infections may be due in part to postinfectious immune paralysis (18, 41) children experience high rates of subsequent pulmonary comorbidity following pneumonia. the most common complications are development of restrictive lung disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic bronchitis (123, 298) the best recognized long-term complications of childhood pneumonia are localized to the affected organ, the lungs. patients with ARDS have mortality rates of 30\u201340%. ARDS and sepsis are well-recognized outcomes of pneumonia. the mechanisms driving the sequelae are multifactorial. no sepsis-specific therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes. improvements in the processes of critical care delivery have resulted in a 50% reduction in short-term case-fatality rates from sepsis over the past two decades. however, this outcome is as grim as ARDS, and severe sepsis patients currently have mortality rates of 33% (469) long-term effects of pneumonia manifest in extrapulmonary organs. pneumonia accelerates or precipitates decline in cognition (445) and functional status. risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure increases fourfold in patients with pneumonia within 30 days. pneumonia appears to increase inflammation, acute delirium, and long-term cognitive risks. risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure may be increased due to prolonged coagulopathy (562), endothelial injury with accelerated atherosclerosis (250), large volume shifts (116), cardiac injury (218, 245, 426), and arrhythmias (521, 522) that result from pneumonia. the most common complications following childhood pneumonia are development of restrictive lung disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic bronchitis (123, 298). acute effects of pneumonia in children also result in altered lung development that increases the predilection for pneumonia later in life (236, 237) physiology underlying long-term and extrapulmonary sequelae of pneumonia is only speculative still. the responsible microbes are too numerous, too ubiquitous, and too diverse. the responsible microbes are too numerous, too ubiquitous, and too diverse. DISCLOSURES No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors."}{"summary": "pneumonia kills more children worldwide than any other disease (425, 528) in the united states, children more commonly survive pneumonia, but even in such advantaged countries pneumonia is the most common reason for children to be hospitalized (566). a fifth of those children need to be in the intensive care unit (ICU), and a third require mechanical ventilation (228). pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory tract infection that is more than acute, more than lower respiratory tract, and more than infection. the pathogenesis of this disease is driven by the host response. pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory tract infection that is more than acute, more than acute, and more than infection. pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis (320, 516). it causes the majority of cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). pneumonia is the cause of ARDS when the lungs contain fluid. the advent of antibiotics was profoundly important, dramatically reducing pneumonia mortality rates in the us during the mid-20th century. Vaccines also decrease rates of pneumonia in populations in which they are adopted, modestly but importantly (154, 174, 175) changes among microbes infecting the respiratory tract influence pneumonia biology. microbes that have recently become recognized as important causes of pneumonia may represent a recent emergence of knowledge more than of microbes. rhinoviruses C and D, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human metapneumoviruses, and more (230). plasmid-mediated colistin resistance is being passed among Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pneumonia agents. there are few unifying principles to the types of microbe that cause pneumonia. these diverse etiologic agents encode a wide variety of microbe-specific virulence pathways that influence the likelihood that respiratory infection will cause pneumonia. readers may wish to consult other reviews specific to relevant microbes. microbes in the lung exceed a host\u2019s capacity to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. for these processes to be effective they must provide adequate levels of immune resistance and tissue resilience (407) the advent of antibiotics was profoundly important, dramatically reducing pneumonia mortality rates in the US during the mid-20th century (336) zoonoses cause rare pneumonias but get considerable attention because of their bioterrorism potential. microbes that have emerged as pneumonia threats in recent decades include Legionella, Pneumocystis, hantavirus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus. the microbes causing pneumonia are extraordinarily numerous and extremely varied. the agents identified include many different viruses and bacteria. the microbes do not appear to share any particular characteristics. a potentially responsible microbe fails to be detected in about one-fifth of childhood pneumonias and more than half of adult pneumonias. the degree to which it or they are truly causal is uncertain. most people who encounter these microbes do not develop pneumonia and do not get seriously ill. innate immunity involves an elaborate network of cells and signals that actively function to eliminate invading organisms. defense also includes anatomical barriers that restrict the deposition of microbes within the respiratory tract. innate immunity involves an elaborate network of cells and signals that actively function to eliminate invading organisms. mediators include multifactorial cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, antimicrobial substances, opsonins, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, adhesion molecules, receptors, apoptotic factors, and more. this response involves the recruitment and/or activation of numerous cell types, some of which have only recently become appreciated in the setting of lung immunity. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages. AM apoptosis is a specialized pathway of immune resistance, while other macrophage death pathways are detrimental to the host. the antimicrobial effector functions of AMs can be sufficient to control low pathogen burdens without recruiting additional cells (2, 111). rophage NF-B activation and cytokine elaboration are altered for prolonged periods of time after the resolution of prior respiratory infections (211), suggestive of trained immunity (363). the degree to which such alterations in AM responsiveness may improve or worsen antimicrobial resistance, and mechanisms responsible for altering these macrophage behaviors demand further attention. in the alveoli, surfactant proteins (SP) A and D, synthesized by the alveolar epithelial type II cells, have critical roles in immune resistance. in the upper respiratory tract and conducting airways of the lung, a prominent feature is mucociliary clearance. a prominent feature is mucociliary clearance. a wide gamut of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents are enabled. epithelial-specific genetic targeting of NF-B activity downstream of many of these receptors (408) is necessary and sufficient for the elaboration of innate lung defense (73, 74, 406, 554, 555) cytokine stimulation of epithelial cells is a requirement for maximum epithelial responses in some settings. cytokine stimulation of epithelial cells requires macrophage activity (392), which can occur in direct response to pneumococcus (392, 406). IL-22-dependent protection includes its capacity to activate epithelial cells via the transcription factor STAT3. IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) can activate epithelial STAT3 to promote induction of the chemokine CXCL5 (495) the epithelium can also signal directly to neutrophils by producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and secreted and transmembrane 1 proteins (246, 465, 554). ly rely on the activity of epithelial cells (82, 119, 284) to control pulmonary immune resistance. epithelial stimulation is safely tolerated in vivo (11) and confers significant protection against bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. apoptotic neutrophils are immunoregulatory, enhancing the resolution of inflammation. the molecules identified are for illustrative purpose and do not represent an exhaustive presentation. the known biological mechanisms governing lung neutrophil recruitment are vast. the primary means of neutrophil-mediated killing are 1) phagocytosis, during which phagolysosomal fusion exposes ingested organisms to reactive oxygen species (via NADPH-oxidase activity) and acidity; 2) degranulation, during which granules release toxic factors such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), gelatinase B (MMP9), cathepsins, defensins, and ation release the chemokine CXCL10, which subsequently enhances neutrophil activity and recruitment through its receptor CXCR3 (213). neutrophil production of chemokines like CXCL10 and CXCL2 may contribute to \u201cswarming\u201d behavior of neutrophils (253), in which neutrophil activation amplifies the local recruitment of neutrophils within the air spaces of infected lungs (FIGURE 3). neutrophils release the chemokine CCL17, which recruits iNKT cells to the interstitium. this is essential to optimal defense in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutrophils can recruit lymphocytes for adaptive immunity purposes. phagocytes can produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-, and IL-12. they can be distinguished from resident cells by a variety of differentially expressed surface markers. the role of recruited macrophages in maintaining immune resistance in the lungs is receiving considerable interest. natural killer (NK) cells represent one type of innate lymphocyte enriched in lung tissue. patients with genetic mutations causing NK cell deficiency are especially prone to viral infections. NK cells are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models. group 1 including ILC1s and NK cells, group 2 including ILC2s, and 3) group 3 including ILC3s and lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells (461, 462, 519) research into ILCs and lung infection is in early stages. ILC1s do not reside or function within the healthy lung. invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells possess an invariant TCR alpha chain and recognize lipid antigens presented by the MHC-like molecule CD1d (53) iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection (373), although this did not alter immune resistance in this particular setting. B1 cells are a self-renewing B cell population that is a major producer of cross-reactive natural IgM antibodies. the innate response activator (IRA) subset of B1a cells has been shown to reside in the pleural space and migrate to the lung parenchyma in response to E. coli pneumonia. it will be of interest to determine whether and how megakaryocytes in the lung are influenced by, and in turn influence, pneumonia. it will be of interest to determine whether and how megakaryocytes in the lung and the differentiation of stemlike precursors into megakaryocytes are influenced by, and in turn influence, pneumonia. pneumonia elicits robust hepatic transcriptome remodeling within hours of pneumonia. regulation of hepatic gene programs guiding APP synthesis is attributed to multiple transcription factors (427), including STAT3, which was originally known as the \u201cacute phase response factor\u201d before it was cloned in the early 1990s. increased mortality and impaired immune resistance in mice lacking hepatocyte RelA and STAT3 (200, 201, 403) demonstrating the physiological significance of lung-liver communication. hepatic acute phase serum can enhance opsonophagocytosis (233) hepatic activity is essential to this blood-borne defense during pneumonia. regulation of metal homeostasis may also be an important form of immune resistance provided by the liver. hepcidin, which is largely driven by IL-6-dependent STAT3 activity in the liver (361), limits iron availability by controlling its absorption in the intestines (362) hepatic gene changes were associated with increased plasma cholesterol. this increase was shown to abrogate pneumolysin-dependent alveolar macrophage necrosis. this suggests that acute phase exudate in the alveolar space directly impairs pneumococcal virulence. recombinant G-CSF alone is sufficient to elicit increases in circulating G-CSF, blood neutrophils, and bone marrow granulopoiesis (447) this is consistent with the notion that lung-derived G-CSF is decompartmentalized to access the bone marrow during pneumonia. the anatomy and distribution of phagocytes within the spleen enable reticuloendothelial clearance of circulating pathogens (324) this is essential for controlling systemic defense and inflammation during pneumonia. the spleen has essential roles in adaptive immune responses, and these may contribute to local lung defense. depletion of gut microbiota with antibiotics impairs K. pneumoniae clearance in the lungs in association with reduced pulmonary cytokine responses and impaired ROS synthesis by AMs. similar immunodeficiency is observed in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia following gut microbiome depletion. broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment ablates intestinal microbiota and significantly increases the number of viable bacteria recovered from the lungs. hyperleptinemia, a hallmark of obesity, may increase risk of pneumonia. higher leptin levels associate with greater pneumonia risk in nonhospitalized adults. higher circulating leptin content in mice, elevated by diverse strategies, can compromise innate immunity in the lungs. febrile-range hyperthermia has numerous consequences on pulmonary inflammation and immunity (186), including elevated neutrophil accumulation and earlier clearance of K. pneumoniae from the lungs (419) fever may serve as a systemic mechanism of brain-derived pulmonary defense. alveolar macrophages AMs are professional phagocytes that reside on the surface of the lower respiratory tract. they represent an initial line of leukocytic antimicrobial defense. studies in mouse models indicate that AMs are yolk sac-derived and extremely long-lived (177, 229, 349) apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). the antimicrobial effector functions of AMs can be sufficient to control low pathogen burdens without recruiting additional cells (2, 111). During pneumonia, macrophages have multiple critical roles in protecting the host against infection (immune resistance) and against injury (tissue resilience) emerging area of focus related to AMs is release of cytokines and other immunomodulating agents within membrane-bound vesicles such as exosomes and microparticles. IL-36, which is essential for efficient resistance against bacterial pneumonia in mouse models, is one such AM product (267) the importance of ciliary action is highlighted by the lung disease. airway ciliated cells are more heterogeneous than previously recognized. subsets of airway ciliated cells have immunomodulatory roles that extend beyond the mechanical clearance of mucus (529) a wide gamut of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents is necessary and sufficient for the elaboration of innate lung defense. several studies in genetic mouse models support toll-like receptor signaling as an important source of immune activation (118, 180, 332, 367, 388, 413) in vitro stimulation of epithelial cells with Streptococcus pneumoniae fails to elicit an NF-B response. stimulation with pneumonic airway lining fluid robustly activates this transcription factor in an IL-1- and TNF-dependent manner (406) the ability of epithelial cells to respond to AMs does not preclude epithelial activation by other cytokines and cells. the epithelium can signal directly to neutrophils by producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) additional epithelial-specific products induced by lung infection include CCL20 (466, 555), short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) (292), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and many others (246) which confer local immune resistance. neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles during pneumonia. neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles. affector roles include activities that enhance antimicrobial activities by other cells. the known biological mechanisms governing lung neutrophil recruitment are vast, with many more almost certainly remaining to be discovered. many local signals coalesce to drive this response, such as pathogen recognition (by PRRs), transcriptional remodeling of responding resident cells (by PRRs), production of early-response cytokines and growth factors (which further stimulate neighboring and remote cells), generation of a chemotactic or haptotactic gradient. phagocytosis exposes ingested organisms to reactive oxygen species (via NADPH-oxidase activity) and acidity. granules release toxic factors such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), gelatinase B (MMP9), cathepsins, defensins, and other antimicrobial proteins into the phagosome and/or extracellular space. the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET neutrophil production of chemokines like CXCL10 and CXCL2 may contribute to \u201cswarming\u201d behavior of neutrophils (253), in which neutrophil activation amplifies the local recruitment of neutrophils within the air spaces of infected lungs. in some cases, neutrophils also can be a source of IL-17 (60, 533), a cytokine driving protective immunity through the induction of IL-17 (60, 533) neutrophils release chemokine CCL17, which recruits iNKT cells to the interstitium. this is essential to optimal defense in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutrophils can recruit lymphocytes for adaptive immunity purposes. neutrophils serve as a consequence and cause of acute pulmonary inflammation. multiple studies support an essential role for recruited macrophages in maintaining immune resistance in the lungs. the role of innate lymphocytes in the context of pneumonia biology is receiving considerable interest. innate lymphocytes are innate with regards to pathogen recognition. patients with genetic mutations causing NK cell deficiency are especially prone to viral infections. the direct requirement of NK cells for maximum antiviral immunity has been observed in animal models. NK cells are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models of pneumonia. ILCs are devoid of the known lineage markers associated with adaptive lymphoid cells. research into ILCs and lung infection is in early stages. despite their relatively low abundance, they can play important roles. invariant natural killer T cells possess an invariant TCR alpha chain and recognize lipid antigens presented by the MHC-like molecule CD1d (53) iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection (373), although this did not alter immune resistance in this particular setting. B1 cells are a self-renewing B cell population that is a major producer of cross-reactive natural IgM antibodies. the innate response activator (IRA) subset of B1a cells has been shown to reside in the pleural space and migrate to the lung parenchyma. these cells then provide a protective GM-CSF-dependent IgM response (530) s AMs are professional phagocytes that reside on the surface of the lower respiratory tract. they represent an initial line of leukocytic antimicrobial defense. studies in mouse models indicate that AMs are yolk sac-derived and extremely long-lived. apoptosis can also be triggered by extracellular cues such as recognition of the cytokine TRAIL by the DR5 receptor on macrophages (468). both TRAIL and apoptosis are required for efficient clearance of bacteria in the lungs (35, 468). AM death by pathways other than apoptosis can be stimulated by agents of pneumonia. AMs use RelA from the NF-B transcription factor family to dispatch numerous cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1, chemokines, IL-6, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), all of which are important for eliciting lung innate immunity (61, 171, 173, 194, 239, 240, 392, 408, 413) macrophages are important as antimicrobial effector cells and as sources of cytokines in the lungs. the profound influence of AMs on pneumonia outcome is further supported by reports of targeted disruption of macrophage function, either pharmacologically or genetically, which impairs innate defense in mouse models of lung infection. gene targeting of MUC5B but not MUC5AC has been shown to render mice more susceptible to bacterial infection. CFTR mutations, which compromise the fluidity of mucus in cystic fibrosis patients (191) also underscore the importance of mucus in lung immunity given the prevalence of lung infections. myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a central adapter protein for much but not all TLR signaling. it is essential for pulmonary immune resistance as evidenced by profound susceptibility to lung infections in individuals with genetic MyD88 deficiency. the ability of epithelial cells to respond to AMs does not preclude epithelial activation by other cytokines and cells. IL-22-dependent protection includes its capacity to activate epithelial cells via the transcription factor STAT3 to produce the antimicrobial siderophore binding protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2) (23), which is itself required for maximum lung immunity (24, 66, 141) additional epithelial-specific products induced by lung infection include CCL20 (466, 555), short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) (292), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) (470), and many others (246) which can confer local immune resistance. the capacity of epithelial cells to control the immunological tone of the lungs is further exemplified by studies showing that their neutrophils have both effector (antimicrobial) and affector (immunomodulatory) roles during pneumonia. effectsor roles include microbial elimination via phagocytosis and degranulation as well as NET formation. neutrophil numbers that can exceed the total circulating pool are microns away at the start of infection. neutrophil numbers that can exceed the total circulating pool are microns away at the start of infection. neutrophils exert an expansive repertoire of intra- and extracellular antimicrobial activities. gene deletion of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in mice increases vulnerability to lung infections with S. pneumoniae (179), whereas S. pneumoniae lacking endonuclease A are less efficient at evading NETs. neutrophils also function in a governing capacity, producing cytokines, chemokines, and other factors that coordinate the ongoing immune functions in the lung (226). induction of CXCL5, CXCL1, G-CSF, and enhanced phagocytic antimicrobial defense. emigrated but not circulating neutrophils represent a prominent source of IFN-. neutrophils can enhance macrophage-mediated immunity by serving as a source of TRAIL, which drives antimicrobial apoptotic responses. neutrophils may be the exclusive resident leukocyte of the airspaces. but they do not represent the only macrophage population driving innate immunity. a distinct population of recruited bone marrow-derived macrophages can have an indispensable role in pulmonary innate immunity. in mice challenged with K. pneumoniae, recruited monocytes were identified as the prominent source of TNF-, contributing to the lung recruitment of ILC3s and IL-17-mediated defense (548). innate lymphocytes bear functional similarities to the B and T lymphocytes well recognized for their roles in adaptive immune responses. GM1 exhibit increased lung bacterial burdens and mortality upon infection with S. pneumoniae (125) NK cells also are essential for clearance of K. pneumoniae (549) and S. aureus (457) in murine models of pneumonia. NK cells may also function at the interface of viral and bacterial pneumonias by limiting the likelihood of superinfection. ILC2s are present under unchallenged homeostatic conditions (152), although their functional contributions to immune resistance are uncertain. ILC2s help repair and regenerate injured lung tissue (44, 279, 333), but ILC2-mediated repair after pneumonia specifically is presently speculative. iNKT cells produce IFN- and IL-22 in response to influenza infection. mice lacking these cells are more susceptible to lung infections with K. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae. roles of MAIT cells during bacterial pneumonia have yet to be demonstrated. platelets contribute to innate immunity as well, with multiple potential connections to pneumonia (46, 550) platelets and associated platelet GTPases and adhesion molecules enhance LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment in the lung and host defense during Klebsiella pneumonia (98, 99, 375), demonstrating roles in immune resistance. the liver has long been appreciated for its role in mounting the acute phase response (APR) there are now dozens of known [and likely many more unknown (403)] APPs, which are functionally diverse, and primarily expressed in the liver (148) cytokine signals from the lung elicit a rapid hepatic response to remodel the blood proteome. failure to mount a liver APR is associated with increased mortality and impaired immune resistance. c transcription factor targeting invovlves decreased deposition of complement component 3 (C3) on the surface of pneumococci (403) a role for pneumonia-induced C3 expression is also supported by a recent study showing that IL-22 increases hepatic and serum C3 levels to a degree that is sufficient to increase its bacterial deposition as well as pulmonary defense. regulation, hemostasis, toxin inhibition, microbial starvation, and more. secreted APPs represent only a fraction of the many hepatic gene changes constituting the acute phase response (8, 403). the importance of liver responses for lung defense demands consideration of non-APP functions. granulopoiesis in the marrow requires the lung to function in an endocrine capacity, much like it does with the liver to elicit the APR. the most prominent is G-CSF (311), the primary intermediate through which pneumonic lungs trigger bone marrow responses. pulmonary G-CSF delivery can also significantly amplify alveolar neutrophil recruitment. genetic targeting of the G-CSF receptor impairs clearance of P. aeruginosa in mouse lungs. this is associated with reduced survival and dramatic decreases in circulating and lung-recruited neutrophils. neutrophils may predispose to pneumococcal pneumonia because of defects in T cell-independent antibodies from the spleen. neutrophils are produced by splenic B cells requiring neutrophils as helper cells. the intestinal mucosa is an immunologically rich environment, shaped by interactions among microbiota, invading pathogens, and host immune functions. pulmonary defense is evident in the setting of viral pneumonia. microbiome ablation impairs immune responses reliant on inflammasome activity. reducing the presence of potentially infectious agents in the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems of vulnerable patients can decrease rates of pneumonia and death in the ICU. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses (59, 262). evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that obesity per se increases risk of community acquired pneumonia. other extrapulmonary influences on intrapulmonary immune responses. a specific polymorphism in angiotensin converting enzyme reduces substance P and bradykinin, both of which drive the cough reflex (524), also consistent with the notion that airway reflex sensitivity contributes to pulmonary defense. the molecules identified are for illustrative purpose and do not represent an exhaustive presentation. NF-B and STAT3 are particularly important for hepatic acute phase changes. this response requires a combination of early-response cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-1) with IL-6. failure to mount a liver APR is associated with increased mortality and impaired immune resistance. reduced opsonophagocytosis after hepatic transcription factor targeting invovlves decreased deposition of complement component 3 (C3) on the surface of pneumococci (403) a role for pneumonia-induced C3 expression is also supported by a recent study showing that IL-22 increases hepatic and serum C3 levels to a degree that is sufficient to increase its bacterial deposition. additional relevant APP functions may include protease regulation, hemostasis, toxin inhibition, microbial starvation, and more. secreted APPs represent only a fraction of the many hepatic gene changes constituting the acute phase response (8, 403). the importance of liver responses for lung defense demands consideration of non-APP functions. resistance requires both resident and recruited leukocytes in the lungs. this shift from homeostatic granulopoiesis to \"emergency\" granulopoiesis in the marrow requires the lung to function in an endocrine capacity. the most prominent is G-CSF (311), the primary intermediate through which lungs trigger bone marrow responses. CSF alone is sufficient to elicit increases in circulating G-CSF, blood neutrophils, and bone marrow granulopoiesis (447), consistent with the notion that lung-derived G-CSF is decompartmentalized to access the bone marrow during pneumonia. genetic targeting of the G-CSF receptor impairs clearance of P. aeruginosa in mice challenged with pneumococcal pneumonia. neutropenia may predispose to pneumococcal pneumonia because of defects in T cell-independent antibodies from the spleen. the intestinal mucosa is an immunologically rich environment, containing a microbial landscape shaped by interactions among microbiota, invading pathogens, and host immune functions. ficiency is also observed in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia following gut microbiome depletion. broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment ablates intestinal microbiota and significantly increases the number of viable bacteria recovered from the lungs. microbiome ablation impairs immune responses reliant on inflammasome activity. adiponectin is another adipokine with inflammation-regulating properties that may influence pulmonary immune resistance. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses (59, 262), but whether or how this factor directly contributes to pneumonia biology is currently unclear. adiponectin deficiency exaggerates immune responses. pneumonia incidence has been shown to correlate with cough reflex sensitivity (355) among patients with mixed primary neurological disorders the incidence of ARDS is significantly greater in those lacking cough and/or gag reflexes (204). a recent meta-analysis indicated markedly higher pneumonia incidence in subjects with a specific polymorphism. the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the last half of the 20th century emphasized the importance of cellular immunity in immune defense of the lungs. the adoption of microbe-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is capable of fighting respiratory infection in inbred animals (182, 232, 558), similar to the transfer of protection achieved with antibodies. cellular immunity also protects the lungs against pneumonia. adaptive immunity is remodeled by prior microbial infections. the establishment of heterotypic immunity and of resident memory. lungs that have experienced prior infections are different from naive lungs that have not. those born before 1968 were likely first infected with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinins (HAs) from phylogenetic group 1 (which includes H1, H2, and H5 HAs) those born after that date were more likely to be first infected by influenza viruses with group 2 HAs (which includes H3 and H7 HAs) adults can be sufficient to protect mice against severe viral or bacterial pneumonia. a population first experiencing the reassortant H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009 (463) patients with greater circulating numbers of CD8+ T cells recognizing epitopes conserved in that coming influenza virus showed less symptoms during their naturally acquired infections with that virus (463) responsive T cells in experienced hosts are more numerous, localized to the right place, able to respond more quickly, and prone to becoming multifunctional. some heterotypic antibodies in human blood can be neutralizing, preventing viral infection of cells. other heterotypic antibodies direct immune effector activities. memory CD4+ T cells established by prior respiratory infections are superior to primary effectors in their protection of the respiratory tract. the expansion of such memory CD4+ T cells in the infected lungs requires IL-6 (474) similar phenomena apply to bacterial pneumonias. ident Memory Cells are localized depots of immune memory within the respiratory tract that specifically protect these tissues against respiratory infection. the best recognized such structures are the tertiary lymphoid organs of the upper airways, the tonsils and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (443) and the variable amounts of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) in the lower airways (412). these sites are sites of local antibody production, as well as sources of memory B cells and plasma a population of lung-resident memory T cells retained in the tissue rather than recirculating with a lung-homing propensity. the lung-derived cells provided better protection as measured by weight loss, survival, and viral burdens. the resolution of lower respiratory infection can seed the lungs with TRM cells that remain local. CD4+ memory T cells are found 1\u20132 mo later in the previously infected lobe rather than contralateral lobes. the previously infected lobe is significantly more protected against infection by pneumococci of a different serotype compared with contralateral lobes. antigen-independent polyclonal activation of human lung-derived T cells (401, 433, 487, 488) stimulates the coexpression of many cytokines (e.g., IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 together) thus the human lung contains a preponderance of TRM cells, which likely have specificity for respiratory pathogens and exert multifunctional roles. the development of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs after recovery from influenza infection (572), suggesting a requirement for this costimulation pathway. the fundamental biology of lung TRM cells remains poorly defined and presents particularly great promise for improving our understanding of pneumonia defense. typic Adaptive Immunity refers to adaptive immunity directed against a microbe that is similar but not identical to the microbe originally establishing immunological memory. healthy young adult humans probably have some degree of heterotypic immune memory against all of the most common causes of pneumonia. those born before 1968 were likely first infected with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinins (HAs) healthy young adults are experimentally infected with influenza virus or RSV. heterotypic antibodies in their blood before experimental infection correlate with their viral burden and symptoms after infection (25, 231) in seronegative individuals who have not seen a particular influenza virus before, those with greater numbers of influenza-responsive CD4+ T cells in their blood before infection (FIGURE 6) have less severe infection as measured by viral burden and symptoms after infection (537) responsive T cells in experienced hosts are more numerous, localized to the right place, and prone to becoming multifunctional. heterotypic antibodies against the conserved stalk region of influenza HA trigger a respiratory burst in phagocytes. heterotypic antibodies against the conserved stalk region of influenza HA trigger a respiratory burst in phagocytes and provide heterotypic defense against respiratory infection that is Fc receptor dependent. human blood from at least three continents consistently contains IgG antibodies against diverse pneumococcal proteins. pneumococcus-recognizing antibodies found in the blood after pneumococcal infection are not necessarily capable of mediating heterotypic protection. cellular immunity makes many contributions to heterotypic protection of the lungs (FIGURE 6). IL-17 stimulates host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi in the lungs. both IL-17 and CD4+ T cells from the spleens of such mice are necessary for heterotypic protection against pneumococcus in the lungs. CR specific to influenza HA were used to restrict analyses to antigen-specific cells. memory CD4+ T cells were collected from the lungs or the spleen of mice with a fully resolved influenza virus infection. the lung-derived memory cells were then found exclusively in the lungs, whereas the spleen-derived cells were found in the recipient mice. the lobe with TRM cells demonstrates far superior lung defense against virulent pneumococci compared with the contralateral lobes without TRM cells. the fact that depletion of CD4+ cells compromises such defense (459) highlights a TRM cell role. thus lung TRM cells protect against diverse types of respiratory pathogens. memory T cells begin accumulating in human lungs as early as infancy (487, 488) cytokine expression from human lung TRM cells stimulated by presentation of microbial antigens has not been reported. pneumococcus presentation to mouse lung TRM cells (459) induces the MHCII-dependent expression of a wide variety of cytokines. the development of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs after influenza infection requires signaling from Notch, low levels of T-bet, and the IL-15 receptor. the maintenance of CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in the lung requires signaling from notch, low levels of T-bet, and the IL-15 receptor (208, 302) infection with influenza virus is capable of altering the phenotypes of alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in the mouse lung for months afterwards (107, 247, 394) the degrees to which BALT, innate lymphocyte accumulation, and such remodeling of epithelial cells and macrophages reflects chronic inflammation, trained immunity (363), aberrant repair, or all of the above. anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are sufficient and necessary to reduce innate immune responses and inflammatory lung injury during pneumonia (94, 170, 195, 505, 507) this comes with the risk of overly blunting immune resistance and exacerbating infection (507) efferocytosis is a complex and tightly regulated process known as efferocytosis (192, 193) efferocytosis steers the environment away from an accumulation of necrotic cells. efferocytosis actively reprograms AMs to release a suite of anti-inflammatory mediators. these factors elicit resilience responses, including but not limited to inflammatory cytokine regulation, epithelial repair, and efferocytosis itself the identification of sessile macrophages challenges existing paradigms of alveolar macrophage biology. only a fraction of alveolar macrophages are recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. bronchoalveolar lavage may have specialized roles in lung resilience during pulmonary inflammation. mechanisms of STAT3-mediated epithelial protection likely involve, at least in part, the induction of gene programs that inhibit apoptosis. protective STAT3-dependent signals require precise regulation given the potential for the development of epithelial adenocarcinoma (286). ing ETS Transcription Factor (SPDEF) is best recognized for driving mucus metaplasia (68) but a nonpathological role of SPDEF is to limit inflammatory gene expression downstream of MyD88 and TRIF (264) some mucus proteins exhibit anti-inflammatory roles in the pneumonic lung (254), as highlighted by protective immunosuppressive effects of MUC1. ances to neutrophils, also accumulate in pneumonic lungs, where they limit immunopathology through synthesis of IL-10 and enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Recruited cells derived from lymphoid progenitors can also limit inflammatory injury in the lungs. NK cells can also be tissue protective, producing IL-22 to mediate epithelial repair in response to viral or bacterial lung infections. glucocorticoids derived from the HPA axis are quintessentially anti-inflammatory. the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids on CXCL5 expression and neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs involve circadian rhythms in airway epithelial cells. anti-inflammatory 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7 nAChR) on alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. this is further supported by enhanced injury in mice lacking 7 nAChR itself. adrenalectomy impairs circadian suppression of airway epithelial cells and exaggerates the lung CXCL5 response. APPs including but not limited to antiproteases and those regulating metal homeostasis confer liver-dependent tissue protection in pneumonic lungs. extrapulmonary organ injury is a common sequela of severe pneumonia, posing concern for sepsis secondary to pulmonary infections. ant proteins A and D (117), PARP (295), EGF (114), Bcl2 (210), and p53 (87) acute injury to the kidneys and brain is also associated with sepsis. bacterial growth and macrophage necroptosis within the mycocardium leads to acute injury and prolonged scarring (56, 159, 417) the activation state of AMs is tightly regulated by their microenvironment (211) in a state of baseline homeostasis, engagement of CD200R, TGF-R, and IL-10R by their corresponding ligands at the epithelial surface is an important negative regulator of alveolar macrophage activity. alternatively activated (M2) AMs generate anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and IL-1RA, and the size of this cell population has been shown to pro-resolving lipid mediators elicit resilience responses, including but not limited to inflammatory cytokine regulation, epithelial repair, and efferocytosis itself (28). a population of nonmotile macrophages in the airspaces appear to have a major influence on tissue resilience (534) the presence of tight junctions and the expression of epithelial Na+ channels (e.g., ENaC and Na+-K+-ATPase) inhibit the airspace liquid accumulation characteristic of pneumonia. these surface proteins are dynamically regulated by host factors such as cAMP agonists, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and TRAIL. disruption of these pathways can enhance acute lung injury. LIF is induced in lung epithelial cells in response to infection (144, 405, 496). it is necessary and sufficient to activate lung epithelial STAT3 (409). the benefits of LIF are solely attributable to increased tissue resilience. exudate macrophages have been identified as an important source of IL-1RA-dependent prevention of epithelial apoptosis and inflammatory injury in mice with pneumonia caused by LPS or K. pneumoniae (195). macrophages support the growth of alveolar epithelial cells and of lung epithelial \u201cpneumospheres\u201d in vitro (279) Recruited ILC2s can limit immunopathology during pneumonia. NK cells can also be tissue protective, producing IL-22 to mediate epithelial repair in response to viral or bacterial lung infections. so resident and recruited cell types enhance intrapulmonary resilience during pneumonia. neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs involve circadian rhythms in airway epithelial cells. adrenalectomy impairs circadian suppression of airway epithelial cells. adrenalectomy promotes inflammatory injury following intrapulmonary challenges. anti-inflammatory role of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells also suggests neural regulation of lung immunity (49) some of the APPs produced in the liver in response to pulmonary infection serve to counter inflammatory injury. some of the APPs produced in the liver in response to pulmonary infection serve to counter inflammatory injury. extrapulmonary organ injury is a common sequela of severe pneumonia. hepatic acute phase changes occur in response to lung infections in mice (403, 404) ER stress and antiapoptotic pathways induced by STAT3 and RelA in hepatocytes are examples of inducible tissue resilience outside of the lungs. a microbiome in the lung has become appreciated due to culture-independent techniques for detecting, identifying, and quantifying bacteria (105) bacteria in the lungs of healthy individuals are likely transients that represent a balanced equilibrium of incoming bacteria with bacterial elimination. in healthy individuals, the microbiota in the lung are similar to that of the mouth. microbes in the respiratory tract microbiome can limit or favor growth of the causative agents of pneumonia (105, 306, 448, 450, 535), a feature that may differentiate the bacteria that cause pneumonia from other bacteria of the normal respiratory tract microbiome. a change in how pneumonia is approached is motivated by the inspiring successes from the cardiovascular community. both pneumonia and infarction are acute events with disastrous consequences. infarction is attacked with blood-thinners and anticoagulants that prevent or eliminate clots. but so much more is done to address the underlying chronic disease predisposing to acute infarctions. about half of children hospitalized with pneumonia have recognizable underlying conditions, especially premature birth or asthma, while the other half do not (228). a large fraction of aging adults suffer from one or more of these chronic conditions, tilting the demographics of pneumonia towards the aging group. the majority of pneumonia cases occur in older subjects, most of whom have recognized risk factors. both the old and young have impaired immune responses to pulmonary pathogens. the combination of poorer immune clearance and increased alveolar pathogen burden potently increases age-associated risks for developing pneumonia. the chronic inflammatory milieu of aging induces multiple changes that contribute to increased pneumonia risk. chronic inflammation increases pathogen adhesion to host cells (92), induces tolerance of TLRs (107), impairs monocyte pathogen clearance (399) and blunts pulmonary innate immune responses to S. pneumoniae (203). short-term exposure to tobacco smoke disrupts airway mucociliary clearance, alters interferon response to viral pathogens, and attenuates alveolar macrophage, natural killer cell, and dendritic cell responses to pathogens (464). chronic exposures to cigarette smoke substantially derail antibacterial adaptive immunity, diminishing bacteria-specific antibodies (both IgA and IgG in the BAL fluid and IgG in the blood) and skewing bacterial antigen-induced T the AMs of COPD patients adapt to increased oxidative stress by increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. responses of COPD lungs to pathogens are further influenced by alterations in the airway microbiome. this leads to a three- to fourfold increased risk for pneumonia in COPD patients (444, 493) hyperglycemia of diabetes impairs neutrophil chemotaxis (100) and superoxide-mediated antimicrobial effects (383), implying additional mechanisms contributing to susceptibility. impaired neutrophil function during liver disease (40) is in part related to tuftsin deficiency (499) chronic alcohol ingestion results in mitochondrial stress leading to dysfunctional alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and increased risk of ARDS during pneumonia. effects of alcohol consumption on redox imbalance and oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages have been attributed, in part, to diminished glutathione availability (57, 95, 288, 560) risk factors include malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, incomplete vaccination, crowded living conditions, indoor air pollution/parental smoking, prematurity or low birth weight, lack of breastfeeding, and HIV infection. breastfeeding is considered one of the most cost-effective interventions to reduce childhood pneumonia. 1 in 10 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 2 days develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (328) despite efforts such as routine chlorhexidine-based oropharyngeal care, ventilator-associated pneumonias represent a pathophysiology driven by simultaneous disruptions to upper airway barrier protection. many immunological mechanisms for how influenza viruses predispose to secondary infections should also apply to viral infections other than influenza. a plethora of bacterial agents beyond pneumococcus and S. aureus are identified in studies of secondary bacterial infections. aging, tobacco, alcohol or drug abuse, poor air quality, nutritional deficiencies, pulmonary disease, nonpulmonary comorbid conditions, and acute illnesses or exposures interact to increase pneumonia susceptibility. increased efforts to interrupt pneumonia susceptibility in those with comorbidities will help break these feed-forward cycles of comorbidity and pneumonia. comorbidities make people more likely to get pneumonia, and pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities. both the old and young have impaired immune responses to pulmonary pathogens. the combination of poorer immune clearance and increased alveolar pathogen burden potently increases age-associated risks for developing pneumonia. the chronic inflammatory milieu of aging induces multiple changes that contribute to increased pneumonia risk. chronic inflammation increases

susceptibility in those with comorbidities will help break these feed-forward cycles of comorbidity and pneumonia. comorbidities make people more likely to get pneumonia, and pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities. pneumonia precipitates and exacerbates comorbidities, which yet further accelerates comorbidities. pneumonia requires hospitalization in 10\u201320% of cases. pneumonia incurs 30-day readmission rates of 20% after hospitalization. for Medicare alone, pneumonia costs 13 billion dollars in healthcare per year. ARDS causes a bilateral injury that includes the diffuse influx of protein-rich edema and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space. this includes destruction of surfactant, formation of fibrin-rich intra-alveolar hyaline membranes, and loss of gas-exchanging type 1 pneumocytes. ARDS and sepsis are well-recognized outcomes of pneumonia. pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, often due to ARDS and/or sepsis. ARDS and sepsis have high mortality rates, but they occur in only a fraction of pneumonia cases. fewer than 10% of all elderly patients hospitalized for pneumonia die from this disease. patients with pneumonia appear to have worse long-term mortality rates. long-term effects of pneumonia are manifest in extrapulmonary organs. pneumonia accelerates or precipitates decline in cognition (445) and functional status (224) poor cognitive and functional outcomes following pneumonia may also result from hypoxia and hypoperfusion during acute illness (445) and from ancillary treatments common to severe pneumonia (e.g., benzodiazepine sedatives and bed rest) that appear to increase inflammation, acute delirium, and long-term cognitive risks (376, 378, 393, 532). Increased risks of recurrent and new infections may be due in part to postinfectious immune paralysis (18, 41) children experience high rates of subsequent pulmonary comorbidity following pneumonia. the most common complications are development of restrictive lung disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic bronchitis (123, 298) the best recognized long-term complications of childhood pneumonia are localized to the affected organ, the lungs. patients with ARDS have mortality rates of 30\u201340%. ARDS and sepsis are well-recognized outcomes of pneumonia. the mechanisms driving the sequelae are multifactorial. no sepsis-specific therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes. improvements in the processes of critical care delivery have resulted in a 50% reduction in short-term case-fatality rates from sepsis over the past two decades. however, this outcome is as grim as ARDS, and severe sepsis patients currently have mortality rates of 33% (469) long-term effects of pneumonia manifest in extrapulmonary organs. pneumonia accelerates or precipitates decline in cognition (445) and functional status. risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure increases fourfold in patients with pneumonia within 30 days. pneumonia appears to increase inflammation, acute delirium, and long-term cognitive risks. risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure may be increased due to prolonged coagulopathy (562), endothelial injury with accelerated atherosclerosis (250), large volume shifts (116), cardiac injury (218, 245, 426), and arrhythmias (521, 522) that result from pneumonia. the most common complications following childhood pneumonia are development of restrictive lung disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic bronchitis (123, 298). acute effects of pneumonia in children also result in altered lung development that increases the predilection for pneumonia later in life (236, 237) physiology underlying long-term and extrapulmonary sequelae of pneumonia is only speculative still. the responsible microbes are too numerous, too ubiquitous, and too diverse. the responsible microbes are too numerous, too ubiquitous, and too diverse.
