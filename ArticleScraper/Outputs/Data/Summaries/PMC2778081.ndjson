{"summary": "aptamers, decoy oligonucleotides, ribozymes, triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO), immunostimulatory CpG motifs, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs and antagomirs. despite these advances, a major impediment to the development of nucleic acid-based strategies for treatment and prevention of diseases is the relatively inefficient means to effectively the most advanced approaches in the field, which are not subject of the present article, are complex carrier systems. for example, there are attempts to combine peptides with cationic liposomes [9-16] or polyethyleneimine (PEI) [17] and other strategies are aimed towards enhanced uptake as well as intracellular trafficking. peptides derived from Tat and antennapedia as well as other proteins are capable of transporting macromolecular cargo molecules into cells [33-35] since the first reports about Tat, a large number of naturally occurring as well as engineered CPPs have been discovered. a large number of naturally occurring as well as engineered CPPs have been discovered. despite widespread interest in peptide carriers, the mechanisms underlying the cellular translocation of CPPs are poorly understood. early work relied upon fluorescence imaging or flow cytometry analysis of chemically fixed cells to examine intracellular localization of fluorescently labeled peptides. peptides appeared to be internalized very rapidly within minutes even at 4 \u00b0C. a caveolae/lipid raft-dependent process for a Tat-GFP fusion protein was found. the precise mechanism of internalization remains elusive. the precise mechanism of internalization remains elusive. the phosphate backbone of the siRNA is shown in red, the nucleobases in light gray. it is assumed that formation of larger particles is driven by hydrophobic peptide/peptide interactions generating free positive charges where other siRNA molecules can interact. this eventually drives complex formation in a sandwich-like assembly reaction. ments were performed with 5 M peptide and 0.5 M siRNA in a Tris-buffered solution at 20\u00b0C using a DynaPro MS/X device. complexes which range in size between 20 and 300 nm with an average of about 200 nm are observed. RNA interference (RNAi) has gained a lot of interest as a tool for functional genomics studies. short hairpin RNA constructs can be expressed endogenously using DNA vectors which code for short hairpin (sh) RNAs. the effects of these constructs can lead to a more stable and long-term result. this strategy requires a gene therapy approach in the long run [87] basal luciferase activity returned to normal levels after LF2000-mediated transfection. siRNAs directed against several endogenous proteins were coupled to penetratin via a disulfide bond. this was in part attributed to the toxicity of the lipids. penetratin c Cu-ZN SOD-1, Caspase-3/-8/-9 primary rat hippocampal or sympathetic neurons [90] Tat48\u201360, penetratin c p38 MAP kinase L929 (mouse fibroblasts), mouse lung (intratracheal) [91] MPG, MPGNLS n-c luciferase, GAPDH HeLa, Cos-7, HS-68 [ valent / n-c = non-covalent, says 92-year-old Dowdy. the successful delivery of siRNA is solely the result of excess free peptide. this leads to additional complexation, and thereby cellular import of the siRNA. histidine/lysine-polymer (H3K8b) yielded up to 80 % knockdown of target gene in several cell types. toxicity was much lower than for commercial cationic lipids Oligofectamine and LF2000. most studies today are performed with the aim of CPP-mediated siRNA delivery in vivo. many of them are already showing promising results, e.g. concerning tumor-targeting and ocular delivery. this is beyond the scope of this review and will be discussed elsewhere in this issue. EB1 has superior endosomolytic activity in comparison to HA2-penetratin. fusing the U1A RNA-binding domain to the Tat peptide led to a redistribution of complex into the cytosol followed by efficient RNAi-mediated gene silencing. at least 70 % of all multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced [108] there are several different types of alternative splicing, amongst others affecting transcription start sites, splice sites, polyadenylation sites or even whole introns and exons. antisense oligonucleotides interacting with mRNA to affect protein production goes back 20 years. the oligonucleotide/RNA duplex forms a substrate for endogenous RNase H, leading to mRNA cleavage. the oligonucleotide/RNA duplex alters pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus. splicing is restored which yields a functional luciferase protein. only oligonucleotides that don\u2019t activate RNase H are applicable [2], e.g. phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO, [122]), locked nucleic acids (LNA, [123]), peptide nucleic acids (PNA, [124]) or 2\u2019-O-methyl-modified oligonucle the authors observed vesicular uptake but no nuclear import for their highly pure conjugates. the rate of uptake could be enhanced by addition of free CPP to the conjugates, though still no biological activity was detected. oligoarginines with non-natural, uncharged amino acids [139] led to the peptide (R-Ahx-R)4 in which Ahx represents a six-atom aminohexanoic acid spacer. the underlying mechanism for this superior activity is not clear yet, as the uptake of (R-Ahx-R)4 constructs was less efficient. netratin splice correction [128] RNA analogues Tat48-58, penetratin, R6-penetratin, transportan, R9, R9F2 and further peptides HIV-1 transactivation [93] PMO R9F2, Tat peptide, penetratin splice correction [136] PMO (R-Ahx-R)4 exon skipping [152] PMO R8-derivatives containing nucleic acid conjugates showed higher serum stability, less endosomal trapping and led to efficient exon skipping in myoblasts and mice at lower dosages than the splice switching PMO alone. a large percentage of intracellular cargo molecules are entrapped in vesicular compartments and thus will not trigger the desired effect. fluorescent peptides or cargos have been quantitatively evaluated by FACS [54] or fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCS) [158] or FRET [159]. in all cases, it is crucial to distinguish between internalized and membrane-associated signals. discrimination between intra- and extracellular material is possible through chemical modification of extracellular components [163] or fluorescence quenching [164] e.g. penetratin, R9 and several novel CPPs can be quantified. adenoviral and plasmid-labeled lipopolymer is the most important rate-limiting intracellular barrier for non-viral vectors. this carrier shows an increased rate of endosomal escape compared to conventional carriers. intranuclear plasmid numbers were required in case of Lipofectamine Plus. 8000-fold higher intranuclear plasmid numbers were required in case of Lipofectamine Plus. this finding suggests a difference in nuclear transcription efficiency after nonviral delivery. peptide MPG -MEDIATED DELIVERY of siRNA and STERIC BLOCK OLIGONUCLEOTIDES - an EXAMPLE OF A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION. in this context, we have for the first time undertaken a detailed side by side comparison of two different model systems using the peptide MPG as delivery agent. transfection of a luciferase-targeted steric block oligonucleotide, we observed strong inhibition of reporter gene readout with an IC50 in the subnanomolar range. a possible explanation for the different degree of reporter gene regulation could be the different intracellular target sites, i.e. the cytoplasm for siRNAs and the nucleus for splice correction oligonucleotides. chloroquine is a weak base, non-charged at neutral pH but charged at pH 5.5 [178] it is able to pass easily through membranes in its uncharged form, but becomes protonated and accumulates within acidic vesicles in its positively charged, membrane-impermeable form. fluorescence microscopy analyses in the presence of 100 M chloroquine yielded two quite contrary outcomes. the underlying mechanism for the different effects triggered by chloroquine in case of peptide/siRNA and peptide/steric block oligonucleotide complexes remains unclear. this is a good example that the cargo can substantially affect the properties and thereby intracellular trafficking of a particular carrier system. living HeLa Luc/705 cells were transfected for 4 h with 2.5 M MPG and 278 nM Cy3-labeled ON-705 PTO in the absence and presence of 100 M chloroquine (CQ) the very left images show an overlay of the phase contrast with all fluorescence channels followed by the red and blue (nuclei) channels. the method is based on the liquid hybridization of a radioactively labeled probe with the corresponding oligonucleotide in cellular lysates. a stringent heparin wash following the transfection procedure is crucial to avoid an overestimation of intracellular nucleic acid molecules due to complexes attached to the outside of the cell membrane. molecules per cell were calculated based on cell number seeded for transfection. for microinjection experiments, molecules per cell were calculated on the basis of the injection volume. siRNA enters a multiple-turnover pathway with one siRNA molecule capable of RISC-mediated cleavage of 50 or more mRNA molecules. the number of molecules needed to trigger an apparent effect is much higher in the splice correction assay compared to the RNAi-based reporter system. the catalytic nature of the multiple-turnover RNAi mechanism might mask such small variations. takeuchi et al. [181] showed that delivery of arginine-rich peptides could be shifted from endocytic uptake to direct membrane translocation. pyrenebutyrate acts as a counteranion and increases the overall hydrophobicity, thereby facilitating a direct translocation through the lipid bilayer. this method was successfully applied for administration of a fluorescent protein and an apoptosis-inducing peptide into arginine-rich peptide PMO conjugates could affect cellular uptake and antisense activity. they could show that the stability is affected by the amino acid composition and the type of linkage to the cargo. another concept makes use of photosensitive substances, which induce the release of macromolecules from vesicles. fusogenic peptides, usually hydrophobic, have membrane perturbing and lipid mixing activities. many well studied representatives of this group are derived from the fusion sequence of influenza virus HA or HIV-1 gp41 [194] and have been used to improve transfection efficiency of non-viral delivery systems. the development of delivery systems for therapeutic oligonucleotides is a fast growing field. despite considerable progress achieved in recent years, even the most advanced systems either lack the efficiencies required for downstream drug development or do show a substantial degree of toxicity. more than 0.1% - 5% of molecules taken up are involved in a biological response, i.e. RNAi-mediated down regulation or splice correction-mediated up regulation of reporter gene activity. this implies that uptake per se is not the limiting factor here. if one would succeed to optimize intracellular trafficking this holds the potential to boost overall efficacy by up to 3 orders of magnitude. this would facilitate a direct quantitative comparison of exceedingly diverse approaches on at least the cellular level. despite significant progress in the field of nucleic acid delivery in vivo as well as in vivo, there still is a long way to go before this will become a standard procedure in the clinic. it might be worthwhile to fathom how far we can push the different systems on this level."}
