{"summary": "two unrelated 10-year-old Dachshunds in the household became sick shortly after. one Dachshund died while the second was diagnosed with pneumonia. despite intensive antibiotic therapy, this dog was later euthanized due to progressive disease. similarity sequence searches against all viral protein sequences in GenBank using BLASTx showed the presence of polyomavirus sequences that could be assembled into a typical 5,136-nucleotide-long circular genome. the presence of DogPyV-1 nucleic acid in lung tissues was confirmed using in situ hybridization. the presence of a novel polyomavirus in both tested Dachshunds raises the possibility that this virus may be a previously unrecognized canine respiratory pathogen. further studies are under way to determine the virus\u2019s prevalence, cellular tropism, and association with canine respiratory disease."}
