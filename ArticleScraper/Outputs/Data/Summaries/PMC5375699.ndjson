{"summary": "ribosome shifts frames before encountering its customary stop codon, often resulting in a C-terminally extended protein. translational readthrough also produces elongated proteins; however, this process involves the normal stop codon being decoded by a near cognate tRNA, thereby allowing for C-terminal polypeptide extension. three members of this genus have been sequenced: TNV-D (21), beet black scorch virus (22), and leek white stripe virus (23) these viruses possess monopartite, single-stranded, 3.8-kb plus-sense RNA genomes that lack both a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. instead, they use a 3\u2032-cap-independent translational enhancer located in their 3\u2032 untranslated regions a similar activity in another tombusvirid, the pelargonium flower break virus (genus Carmovirus), was shown to be important for efficient infection of plant hosts. a similar activity in another tombusvirid, the pelargonium flower break virus (genus carmovirus), was shown to be important for efficient infection of plant hosts. northern blot analysis of TNV-D RNA accumulation in plant protoplasts incubated for 22 h at 22\u00b0C. the positions of the viral genome (g) and sg mRNAs (sg1 and sg2) are indicated to the left of the blot. the relative genome levels (rel. g) are provided below. deletion of 3 or 6 nucleotides (nt) from the bulge in mutants 3 and 6 reduced translational readthrough to 10% that of wild type (wt), and eliminated genome accumulation in infections. a silent substitution of U to G was made in the nucleotide just 3\u2032 to the PRTE, creating 3G. apical loop and AG mismatch in p82 amino acid sequence did not affect readthrough or infectivity levels at 22\u00b0C. p82 amino acid sequence was maintained in mutants Lm1, Lm2 and Lm3. a CG canonical pair could be replaced with a CG canonical pair. mutations designed to disrupt the stem of Pre-RTSL reduced readthrough by 10 to 20%. in protoplasts incubated at 22\u00b0C, there were various degrees of genome accumulation, ranging from 55 to 97%. at 29\u00b0C the level of all mutants was reduced by half. these results suggest a relatively minor role for Pre-RTSL in readthrough. the PK interaction is well conserved and includes covarying base pairs. the PK interaction is also well conserved and includes covarying base pairs. in TNV-D, but not other betanecroviruses, this region can adopt an alternate fold, Con-2. all residues in regions 1 and 3 (blue) corresponding to the stem of Con-1 exhibited low flexibility (Fig. 4A) regions 2 and 5 (yellow) exhibited lower levels of flexibility at the 3\u2032 end of region 2 and the 5\u2032 end of region 5. this suggests that under the assay conditions, the proposed pseudoknot may be partially formed and less stable. the downstream substitution in mutants 1B and 1C resulted in a conservative amino acid change of threonine to serine. however, this same replacement is present naturally in BBSV. both disruptive mutants showed a decline in genomes to 50 to 60% of the wt. con-1 of post-RTSL appears to be the functionally relevant structure. wt and mutant pseudoknot interactions are highlighted in yellow with compensatory mutations indicated in red. in vitro translation analysis of pseudoknot mutants. apical loop of SLII facilitates readthrough and genome accumulation. loop replacement in SLI and SLII led to a significant decrease in readthrough (15%) and genome (wt) the terminal loop (AACA) was replaced with a different class of superstable tetra-loop (UUCG) or a modified loop sequence (GACG) in both cases, there was a decrease in p82 production and genome accumulation to below 20% of wt. these strong phenotypes were observed at the less stringent 22\u00b0C incubation temperature of protoplasts. all disruptive mutations in the upper portion of the stem had various negative effects. the exception being SLII-1C, where the regenerative GC pair did not lead to recovered readthrough. the entire SLII structure is relevant to the activities that were monitored. mutants containing deletions in multiples of three nucleotides were tested for their ability to produce p82 in wheat germ extract and to accumulate in protoplast transfections. deletions were designed to precisely remove complete amino acids in p82 (i.e., methionine, glycine, and arginine) PRTE, which generated an uninterrupted portion of helix in RTSL and a more stable RTSL, also yielded low levels of p82 production (8%) and no genome replication. deletions in the PRTE bulge dramatically reduced p82 translation in vitro and eliminated genome accumulation in infections. mutant USm1, wt levels were observed for readthrough and genome accumulation at 22\u00b0C, but at 29\u00b0C the genome levels dipped by 20%. a conserved RNA hairpin upstream of the RTSL affects readthrough minimally and facilitates viral genome accumulation. pre-RTSL mutants are shown in the gray box with substituted nucleotides in red. in TNV-D, there is a predicted tertiary RNA structure called Post-RTSL (or Con-1) located immediately downstream of the RTSL. regions of conservation included a base-paired stem structure (blue) and a potential pseudoknot (PK) forming interaction (yellow) in vitro selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis was performed on transcripts of the full-length TNV-D genome. nucleotides that are flexible are more readily modified and are predicted to correspond to single-stranded residues. otide is plotted graphically, where red, green, and black bars represent highly reactive, moderately reactive residues. regions of the graph corresponding to the stem and pseudoknot of Con-1 are highlighted in blue and yellow, respectively, and numbered. three base pairs were targeted with silent compensatory mutations in PKA, PKB, and PKC. in wheat germ extract, the disruptive mutants resulted in a decline in readthrough to 52 and 57%. regenerative mutant resulted in a recovery of p82 production to 99%. TNV-D has a predicted silencer/3\u2032-end interaction. its functional importance has not been assessed. this 3\u2032-proximal region is relevant to translational readthrough. the silencer/3\u2032-end interaction must pair with the PRTE. the apical loop of SLII facilitates readthrough and genome accumulation. two stem-loop structures, SLI and SLII, flank the DRTE. loop replacement in SLII led to a significant decrease in readthrough (15%) and genome (30%) levels at 22\u00b0C. a series of compensatory mutations targeting base pairs in the upper (SLII-1, -2, and -3 series), middle (SLII-4 series) and lower (SLII-5 series) regions of the stem in SLII. the entire SLII structure is relevant to the activities that were monitored. iii) proximity to previously characterized functional regions of the genome. silent modifications to the candidate partner sequence did not notably affect readthrough or genome accumulation, thereby ruling out possible involvement in the activity associated with the terminal loop. mal to readthrough sites, including that in TNV-D (6), is known to positively correlate with readthrough efficiency. deletion of the bulge in mutant PRTE inhibited readthrough activity. this suggests that the PRTE-DRTE interaction does more than simply stabilize the RTSL. the RNA hairpin in pea enation mosaic virus (genus Umbravirus, family Tombusviridae) does not influence frameshifting in the wt context, but can act as an inhibitor when tested in a modified viral context (11). Conversely, the upstream hairpin in barley yellow dwarf virus (genus Luteovirus, but related to tombusvirids) (43) was found to enhance frameshifting (18). an RNA element located just 3\u2032 to the RTSL was found to be important for efficient readthrough in vitro. the post-RTSL could act as a type of structural insulator to promote proper folding of the RTSL. the 3\u2032-proximal 80 nt of the TNV-D genome harbors RNA elements important for genome replication and readthrough. the silencer/3\u2032-end interaction is critical for genome accumulation in protoplast infections. the same interaction also modestly modulated readthrough under our assay conditions. no major effects on readthrough or genome accumulation in infections were observed. the sequence could engage other genomic sequences through noncanonical interactions or bind to a required protein factor. the sequence in cAACAg and cUCCUAUg is identical to that in BBSV. readthrough activity suggests that the PRTE-DRTE interaction does more than simply stabilize the RTSL. the specific structure formed by the interaction could be important for function, or the interaction could recruit other required 3\u2032-proximal RNA elements or their associated proteins. the upper region of the TNV-D RTSL was also investigated for function. the upstream hairpin in barley yellow dwarf virus (genus Luteoviridae, but related to tombusvirids) (43) was found to enhance frameshifting (18) disruption of the upstream hairpin present in TCV did not affect readthrough in vitro. however, genome accumulation was reduced in infections to 28% that of wt. the post-RTSL is predicted to form a pseudoknot structure that is located just 9 nts downstream from the base of the RTSL. this would position it close to ribosomes engaging the stop codon. the post-RTSL could act as a type of structural insulator to promote proper folding. the silencer/3\u2032-end interaction is critical for genome accumulation in protoplast infections. the loop of SLII in the 3\u2032-proximal region was found to be a major contributor to readthrough efficiency. the same interaction also modestly modulated readthrough under our assay conditions. corresponding loop sequences are cAACAg and cUCCUAUg. the sequence in LWSV is identical to that in TNV-D. it remains to be determined whether either of these sequences is able to function in a manner similar to that observed for TNV-D. RNA secondary structures were predicted at 37\u00b0C using Mfold version 3.6. selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension was performed as previously described. capped in vitro transcribed viral genomic RNA (45) 3 105 protoplasts were transfected with 3 g of viral genomic RNA. the total nucleic acids were extracted as described previously (45) and separated in nondenaturing 2% agarose gels. in vitro transcribed RNA was refolded, treated with 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride, and then subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) the top 10 peak intensities were averaged, and all raw nucleotide reactivities were divided by this average. 105 protoplasts were transfected with 3 g of viral genomic RNA. the total nucleic acids were extracted as described previously (45) and separated in nondenaturing 2% agarose gels."}
