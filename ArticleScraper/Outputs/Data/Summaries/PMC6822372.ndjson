{"summary": "acute peripheral immune challenge differentially altered cytokine and chemokine levels in the brain versus the brain. peripheral immune challenge altered GFAP and IBA-1 immunoreactivity in the brain in a strain and sex-dependent manner. online version of this article (10.1186/s12974-019-1569-2) contains supplementary material. results represent cytokine concentrations in the serum (A), cortex (B), hippocampus (C), and cerebellum (D) of male and female Lewis (N=15; 7M, 8F) and BN (N=15; 6M, 9F) rats. table displays statistical analysis of immune challenge (Imm), adjuvant-only (Adj) and saline (Sal) conditions with representative colors: red, p0.05; light red, 0.05p0.1; dark blue, p0.05; light blue, 0.05p0.1. blue cells are the inverse relationship and would represent a decrease in Imm compared to Sal."}
