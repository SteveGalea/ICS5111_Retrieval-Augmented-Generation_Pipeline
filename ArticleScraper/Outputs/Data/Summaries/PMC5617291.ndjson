{"summary": "the soluble ectodomain and the FL of EBOV GP have shown very different structures at neutral and low pH (18, 25) the soluble ectodomain and the FL of EBOV GP exhibit very different conformations when bound to DPC micelles at neutral and low pH. expression, purification, and solution NMR structure of the EBOV MPER/TM domain. expression, purification, and solution NMR structure of the EBOV GP2 domain. color codes are matched with domain structure. the EBOV MPER/TM domain assumes very similar structures in its pre- and postfusion forms. we recorded sets of heteronuclear triple-resonance spectra of 13C,15N-labeled samples in fully deuterated DPC as indicated in Methods. MPER/TM was reconstituted in 15% (wt/vol) DMPC/DHPC bicelles by reconstituting MPER/TM into DMPC vesicles followed by addition of an appropriate amount of DHPC that dispersed the vesicles into bicelles. HSQC spectra of the bicelle samples were collected at 45 \u00b0C instead of 30 \u00b0C to obtain sharper resonance lines. HSQC cross-peaks were dispersed well enough to pursue assignment of large parts of the MPER/TM segment. the problem with the full-length construct is that it contains a well-known trimerization motif in the N-heptad repeat region (NHR) of the ectodomain. the paramagnetic quenching profiles in Fig. 2 A\u2013C show that the N-terminal and front of the MPER region were accessible to Gd(DTPA) but not to 5- and 16-DSA. the TM region was highly quenched by 16-DSA, but less by the shallower membrane probe 5-DSA and the soluble probe Gd(DTPA) the protein was reconstituted into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPG):1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPG):1-palmitoyl-2-ole MPER/TM domain in lipid bilayer based on structural restraints obtained by NMR in DPC micelles and by EPR in lipid bilayers. no spin\u2013spin interactions were detected in either situation, indicating this construct is monomeric in. the angle between the MPER and TM domain was preserved in lipid bilayers. to this end, we double-labeled with nitroxide spin labels the MPER/TM construct at cysteine residues introduced in positions 643 and 666. these sites were chosen because they did not interfere with each other or clash with other residues based on the NMR structure. we obtained highly resolved spectra of a construct comprising the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) followed by MPER and TM (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). the shorter MPER/TM construct shows virtually all corresponding peaks in the CHR/MPER/TM construct, indicating that the CHR domain unlikely influences the structure. HSQC spectra of the MPER/TM domain titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled FL. the chemical shifts of most residues were unaffected by this titration. surprisingly, the TM region of the domain was not affected by this titration. HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled FL titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled MPER/TM domain. residues shown in red whose chemical shifts are most perturbed by the addition of the FL. functional consequences of EBOV FL-MPER/TM domain interaction site mutations. alanine mutations in the MPER region promote cell entry at various concentrations compared with an alanine in this position. full-length GP2 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes (virosomes) that were then reacted with fluorescent lipid-labeled liposomes to measure fusion between the virosomes and liposomes at various pH values. this system gave much better control of the fusion reaction and ensured a precise 1:1 stoichiometry of the FL and MPER/TM domains. a previous study showed that the W518A mutation in the FL did not express well on the surface of VLPs. a similar helical packing has been reported at low pH for the related Marburg virus (26). pH, it forms a hydrophobic fist that penetrates more deeply into the membrane/micelles at low pH (18) there is no structure available for the MPER/TM domain of GP2. we successfully expressed and purified a construct encompassing both of these regions of GP2. twenty lowest energy structures of the MPER/TM domain in DPC micelles at pH 5.5. the proteins were concentrated in DPC micelles, and 1H-15N heteronuclear quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were recorded at pH 7.0 and 5.5. this indicates that the EBOV MPER/TM domain assumes very similar structures in its pre- and postfusion forms. structural statistics are reported in SI Appendix, Table S1. the ensemble is characterized by an unstructured N-terminal region (residues D632 to N641), a helical MPER region (D642 to Q650), a turn (W651 to I656) and a TM helical region (G657 to F676). completely superimposable continuous wave EPR data were collected in micelle and bicelle environments at room temperature. despite this close similarity of secondary structure, we did not attempt to calculate the complete 3D structure in bicelles because the resonances of the aliphatic side chains overlapped in the bicelle system. we also performed NMR experiments on full-length EBOV GP2 and attempted to solve its structure in DPC micelles. we also investigated full-length GP2 in lipid bicelles by NMR. only about half of the 16 expected Leu cross-peaks could be observed in an HSQC spectrum of GP2 at pH 7 and 5.5. lipid bicelles (Fig. 2 D\u2013F) and micelles (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 D\u2013F) were reconstituted into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC:1-palmit) oyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (POPG) (85:15) vesicles, and power saturation EPR experiments were performed in the presence of water-soluble Ni-ethylenediamine-N,N\u2032-diacetic acid (NiEDDA) and membrane-permeant O2 and N2 (Fig. 3A) the five lowest energy structures of the MPER/TM domain calculated using XPLOR-NIH within an implicit membrane model using power saturation EPR data as additional restraints. we performed double electron resonance (DEER) experiments of the Cys677-nitroxide\u2013labeled protein in DPC micelles, DMPC/DHPC bicelles, and DMPC/membrane scaffolding protein 1D1 nanodiscs. the five lowest energy structures calculated by this procedure are shown in Fig. 3D. this suggests that the MPER helix resides slightly beneath the phosphate level of the lipid headgroups and that the TM helix transverses the lipid bilayer at an angle. the calculations are all based on experimental measurements. peptides or fusion loops of class 1 viral fusion proteins may interact during a late stage in membrane fusion (27) there is relatively little direct experimental evidence that such interactions occur in fact between the relevant protein segments. however, even in this case, the interaction has not been demonstrated structurally. the identified sites of interaction are consistent with the depths of membrane insertion of the MPER/TM and FL domains. they support the notion that the two domains indeed interact with each other in membrane environments, consistent with current models of late steps of type 1 viral fusion protein-mediated membrane fusion. two interacting residues of the MPER were changed to alanines in single site mutations. five residues were replaced with alanines in the critical region of the FL structure. mutants expressed well and could be easily purified and refolded. the 4A construct contains four consecutive alanine mutations on the MPER region residues Trp645 to Trp648. the critical FL-interactive residue Trp645 in the MPER region promotes cell entry at various concentrations compared with an alanine in this position. a control experiment, the entire FL was deleted from GP2 (NHR-TM construct), the residual fusion activity was less than 20% of the full-length WT GP2 fusion activity. the results prove that the FL is needed for observing appreciable fusion in this system and that each of the four interacting residues of the MPER is critical to support this activity. the fusion domains are connected by shorter or longer loop regions. the fusion domains are exposed to the lipid bilayer of the target membrane. the CHR regions fold back onto the NHR trimers to form six-helix bundle structures. structure, oligomerization, and orientation of the HA TM domain were also determined in lipid bilayers (42). structure of EBOV GP2 consists of a helix-turn-helix motif. two critical tryptophans, Trp645 and Trp648, seem to be responsible for this location. this structure is different from a model of the HIV MPER/TM domain. other authors found the HIV TM domain (without the MPER domain) to be a well-ordered trimer in DMPC/DHPC bicelles (41) the EBOV FL also features a tryptophan, Trp518, which is central to its interaction with the MPER/TM domain. the predominant interaction region of the FL is characterized by a distorted helical turn comprised of the sequence Tyr517-Trp-Thr-Thr-Gln-Asp521. this residue of the FL is also critical for proper folding of the FL in the full-length protein. 648 with alanines were more severe in inhibiting association with the FL. replacements of all residues in the identified interaction region had quite significant effects on binding to the MPER/TM domain. mutations of all critical residues identified by NMR in the FL altered binding to the MPER/TM domain. a mechanism has been proposed for the fusion peptide of parainfluenza virus 5 (38) several critical aromatic residues (Tyr517 and Trp518 on the FL and Trp645 and Trp648 on the MPER domain) are likely important for the initial location of these domains in the membrane interface. fusion proteins were designed with the Trp leader protein in front of a thrombin cleavage site and the MPER/TM or GP2 sequence. the two palmitylation sites C670 and C672 in the MPER/TM domain were mutated to alanines to avoid the formation of nonnative disulfides. 20 mM Na phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 1% n-octyl-d-glucopyranoside (-OG) was added to the extruded liposomes to a final concentration of 0.125% -OG. EBOV MPER/TM in DPC was added to give an estimated protein:lipid ratio of 1:200 and incubated for at least 1 h before dialysis. HCCONH- and HCCH-total correlated spectroscopy experiments were performed. 15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY were performed with 120-ms mixing times. an aromatic 13C-edited NOESY experiment was also performed with 80-ms mixing time. ctyl--d-glucopyranoside, pH 8, followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mM Na phosphate, 100 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.0. power saturation curves were obtained from peak-to-peak amplitudes of the central (M = 0) lines of the first derivative EPR spectra. the three lowest energy structures were selected from the family of structures generated from structure calculation using XPLOR-NIH and the implicit membrane potential. for each structure, the program MMM was then used to generate predicted distances for each of the spin label pairs used in the DEER experiments (68). the segment comprising residues 645 to 676 was treated as a single rigid body based on PRE data. the backbone atoms, beta carbons, and the proximal sulfur atom were grouped together for residues 666 and 670. this resulted in a fixed spin label conformation for residues 666 and 670. 0.1 M FL-Alexa 488 in DPC was placed in a quartz cuvette of a Jobin\u2013Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrometer. increasing amounts MPER/TM-Alexa 546 in DPC were titrated to this solution. excitation and emission slit widths were set to 1 nm. liposomes composed of POPC:POPG (85:15) with 1.5 mol% rhodamine(Rh)-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) [NBD]-DOPE were prepared by extrusion of appropriately mixed lipid dispersions in HMA buffer. HEK293T/17 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding for VP40, -lactamase-VP40, mCherry-VP40, and WT, W645A GP with a C-terminal V5 tag. after 48 h of incubation, the cell medium was collected and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. the final VLP pellets were resuspended in HM buffer fusion proteins were designed with the Trp leader protein in front of a thrombin cleavage site and the MPER/TM or GP2 sequence. the two palmitylation sites C670 and C672 in the MPER/TM domain were mutated to alanines to avoid the formation of nonnative disulfides. 20 mM Na phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer was added to the extruded liposomes to a final concentration of 0.125% -OG. then, EBOV MPER/TM in DPC was added to give an estimated protein:lipid ratio of 1:200. after formation of proteoliposomes, samples were concentrated, and buffers were exchanged to the desired final buffers. 15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY were performed with 120-ms mixing times to obtain NOE-based distance information. an aromatic 13C-edited NOESY experiment was also performed with 80-ms mixing time to obtain additional distance restraints. n-octyl--d-glucopyranoside, pH 8, followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mM Na phosphate, 100 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.0. power saturation curves were obtained from peak-to-peak amplitudes of the central (M = 0) lines of the first derivative EPR spectra. the three lowest energy structures were selected from the family of structures generated from structure calculation using XPLOR-NIH and the implicit membrane potential. for each structure, the program MMM was then used to generate predicted distances for each of the spin label pairs used in the DEER experiments (68). the segment comprising residues 645 to 676 was treated as a single rigid body based on PRE data. the backbone atoms, beta carbons, and the proximal sulfur atom were grouped together for residues 666 and 670. a single cysteine mutation was introduced in position 643 of WT and various mutant EBOV MPER/TM domains. 0.1 M FL-Alexa 488 in DPC was placed in a quartz cuvette of a Jobin\u2013Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrometer. increasing amounts MPER/TM-Alexa 546 in DPC were titrated to this solution. excitation and emission slit widths were set to 1 nm. liposomes composed of POPC:POPG (85:15) with 1.5 mol% rhodamine(Rh)-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) [NBD]-DOPE each were prepared by extrusion of appropriately mixed lipid dispersions in HMA buffer. hek293T/17 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding for VP40, -lactamase-VP40, mCherry-VP40, and WT, W645A GP with a C-terminal V5 tag. after 48 h of incubation, the cell medium was collected and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. the final VLP pellets were resuspended in HM buffer blue was used to measure entry (73) using FlowJo software."}
