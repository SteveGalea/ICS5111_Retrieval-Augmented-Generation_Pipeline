{"summary": "recombinant mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (MuHN) and measles hemagglutinin (MeH) were present in large aggregates, were inactive and totally insoluble under native conditions. the majority of recombinant protein was found in immature form of non-glycosylated precursors. eEF1A may explain the mechanism by which only large chaperones, but not small Hsps are upregulated during this stress response. the involvement of eEF1A may explain the mechanism by which only large chaperones, but not small Hsps are upregulated. two additional stress responses induced by misfolded membrane proteins with lesions in a membrane span or a cytosolic domain (called UPR-M/C) have been preliminarily characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the analysis of virus surface protein overexpression revealed a stress response virtually indistinguishable from UPR-Cyto. elucidation of the reasons for these differences would provide important data concerning evolution of molecular mechanisms in eukaryotic cells. a good example is the humanization of N-glycosylation pathway in yeast Pichia pastoris, that was based on an extensive knowledge about the main N-glycosylation pathways in yeasts and in humans. expression of muHN and MeH in yeast cells has not been examined previously. the genes encoding the full-length mumps virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (MuHN) and measles virus hemagglutinin (MeH) were inserted into yeast expression vectors and expressed under the control of strong galactose-inducible promoters in S. cerevisiae cells. expression of both muHN inant MuHN and MeH causes overexpression of some cellular proteins in yeast. all lysates were prepared from galactose-induced yeast cells of S. cerevisiae pep4 strain, transformed with empty vector (lane 1) or plasmids expressing MuHN. lysates showed that synthesis of viral surface proteins causes overexpression of some cellular proteins. expression of paramyxovirus HN glycoprotein in cells of higher eukaryotes stimulates synthesis of several cellular proteins, especially ER chaperone GRP78-BiP. this effect is less pronounced than the increase in amount of the 70 kDa protein in yeast. muHN and MeH were present in the insoluble multimeric forms due to intermolecular sulfhydryl bonds. recombinant MeH failed to react with measles positive human sera in ELISA. similar observations were reported for rabies, vesicular stomatitis and Sindbis virus glycoprotein analogues produced in yeast. mab 782 cross-reacted with both major and minor bands of recombinant MeH. both 65 kDa and 75 kDa forms of MeH protein were insoluble under mild denaturing conditions in 8 M urea solution. eEF1A was removed from recombinant protein aggregates only by including a reducing agent (at least 60-100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) it suggests that eEF1A is involved in formation of complex with MuHN and MeH multimers. 0.2 ESI Co-chaperone, Response to heat Cytoplasm Soluble in non-ionic detergent 9 Sti1 1.6

determined; NA - not assayed. major and minor forms of muHN were also distinguished in partially purified samples. blotting of partially purified proteins using a lectin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. the minor component of the purified proteins was stained with concanavalin A. the major forms of yeast-expressed MeH and MuHN correspond to unglycosylated polypeptides remained unstained. the expression of MeH in transformants with one copy of integrated MeH gene is too low to be detected by Western blot. the expression of MeH in transformants with one copy of integrated MeH gene is too low to be detected by Western blot. lowering the expression level has no effect on properties of recombinant MeH protein. obtained in S. cerevisiae using moderate promoter for MeH and MuHN expression. less amount of recombinant protein was achieved (compared to that using strong promoters) however it was insoluble in similar aggregates as described above. the only effect of using a moderate and not a strong promoters was a decrease in the expression level of MeH with a less pronounced stress response. whole cell lysates from P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae analysed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody. dotted arrow indicates glycosylated MeH form, whereas solid arrow indicates unglycosylated MeH precursor. arrows indicate unglycosylated MeH polypeptides, whereas dotted arrows indicate unglycosylated MeH polypeptides. the 5' part of meH gene encoding N-terminal transmembrane (TM) anchor domain was removed and the rest of the gene was in frame fused with 269 bp fragment encoding the -factor signal sequence. expression level exceeded the limit of successful translocation. recombinant -MeH protein from both yeast genera was insoluble. lysates obtained from both yeast genera overexpressing native sequence MeH variant were also shown on the same blot. similar sequences were shown to act as a premature polyadenylation sites in P. pastoris. this is a species-specific phenomenon of P. pastoris. differences in mRNA 3'-end formation between the P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae have been reported earlier [14,22] pH 3-10) showed that the vast majority of differently expressed proteins are focused within a pI range of 4-7 and with an Mw ranging from 20 to 120 kDa. we used a narrow range pH gradient (pH 4-7) which allowed us to resolve a major 70 kDa band of overexpressed cellular proteins into three closely packed spots on 2D gels. whole cell lysates, in the middle (D-F) fractions of proteins, soluble at high salt concentration, and in the bottom panel (G-I) proteins, identified from soluble and insoluble fractions are shown. dotted arrows point to the proteins, identified from soluble and insoluble fractions. treatment with Triton X-100 fully solubilized only co-chaperone Sgt2p. large Hsps were solubilized from MuHN and MeH at high salt concentration. this showed a new protein (spot 11) interacting with both muHN and MeH. sHsps could only be removed from insoluble viral protein aggregates. this demonstrates the formation of irreversible protein aggregates containing sHsps. expression of Hsp26 was not upregulated, whereas Hsp42 expression was too low to be detected in whole cell lysates. centrifugation for 45 min. at 16000 g was required to sediment muHN/MeH and eEF1A aggregates from membrane fractions dissolved in IEF buffer without reducing agent. 10 min. at 10000 g was sufficient in case of last insoluble fractions treated with IEF buffer without DTT. eEF1A involvement in the core of MuHN and MeH aggregates raised a question about regulation of eEF1A expression in observed cellular stress. eEF1A is one of the most abundant proteins in yeast expressed at more than 500,000 copies per cell [29,30] we did not assay eEF1A expression fold change in NEPHGE based 2D experiments. however, the upregulation of eEF1A expression in response to synthesis of recombinant viral protein is evident. this data indicates that eEF1A plays an important role in the specific stress response in S. cerevisiae cells. mumps and measles virus nucleocapsid proteins harbour empty expression vector pFGG3. expression of viral nucleocapsid proteins had no inhibitory effect on yeast growth. synthesis of viral surface glycoproteins specifically inhibits yeast growth. western blot using monoclonal antibody 782 to the native MuHN. both native and His-tagged MuHN sequence variants were detected as 60 kDa bands (lanes 2 and 3 respectively) recombinant muHN and MeH protein fractions insoluble in 8 M urea solution. recombinant muHN and MeH proteins were insoluble even in 8 M urea. rabies, vesicular stomatitis and Sindbis virus glycoprotein analogues produced in yeast. long solid arrows indicate major, while dotted arrows indicate major. minor forms of partially purified recombinant MuHN (lane 2) and MeH (lane 3) were partially purified based on their insolubility in urea solution. the pellets were resuspended in denaturing buffer B containing 8 M urea. soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation. eEF1A was removed from recombinant protein aggregates only by including a reducing agent (at least 60-100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) which also solubilized MuHN and MeH. aturing conditions All fractions except insoluble under denaturing conditions 4 Kar2 3.8 0.4 M Chaperone, UPR

cells, respectively, SD. eLysates were fractionated into different fractions based on protein solubility under various conditions. molecular weight estimates of native muHN and MeH glycoproteins are not consistent with molecular weights of native muHN and MeH glycoproteins. glycosylated MeH protein usually constitutes two bands of 74-78 kDa [20], and muHN glycosylated forms of 74-76 kDa are observed [21]. the expression of MeH in transformants with one copy of integrated MeH gene is too low to be detected by Western blot. a range of MeH expression level is detected in multicopy pPIC3.5K-MeH transformants, resistant to various concentrations of antibiotic G418. the expression of MeH in transformants with one copy of integrated MeH gene is too low to be detected by Western blot. lowering the expression level has no effect on properties of recombinant MeH protein. all synthesized protein was detected in the insoluble fractions in transformants with both high and low levels of MeH and MuHN expression. the same result was obtained in S. cerevisiae using moderate promoter for MeH and MuHN expression. dotted arrows point to glycosylated MeH form and dashed arrows show cellular proteins upregulated in response to MeH expression. fractions insoluble in 1% TritonX-100 and 1M NaCl were obtained from P. pastoris transformants using same method as described in Methods for S. cerevisiae samples. whole cell lysates from P. pastoris (C, In, SP and SG) and S. cerevisiae (Sc) were analysed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody. pPIC3.5K-MeH transformant for intracellular expression of full sequence MeH protein. a majority of recombinant MeH protein was translocated into ER and glycosylated (Figure 4 -MeH lanes) however, we did not achieve active recombinant protein by this manipulation. chimeric protein aggregated in the ER lumen and was not secreted in the culture media. ase F digestion of S. cerevisiae expressed MeH and -MeH. similar forms of MeH protein were obtained in both yeast genera. two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrum (MALDI-MS) fingerprinting with additional nanoscale liquid chromatography. electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) were used to separate and analyse the proteins. only the proteins interacting with recombinant viral protein aggregates or exhibiting positive expression change are indicated in Table 1. most of the identified proteins, overexpressed in response to synthesis of MuHN and MeH, are chaperones. i1p and Sgt2p are co-chaperones, which use tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) to interact with identified Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp110 chaperones [24,25] and thus coordinate and regulate the activities of the large Hsps in chaperone complexes [26,27] the interaction of cellular proteins with MuHN and MeH was studied after fractionation of yeast lysates using centr a major protein spot 11, double spot 12 and spots 1-3 were identified as small heat shock proteins 26 and 42. spots 1-3 corresponded to Hsp70 chaperones, identified from cell lysates. small heat shock proteins (sHsps) also appeared to be involved in cellular stress response, however these proteins displayed different interactions with MuHN and MeH. muHN and MeH were identified as eEF1A. membrane protein fractions were dissolved in denaturing IEF buffer. the pellets were separated by centrifugation for 45 min. at 16000 g. eEF1A involvement in the core of muHN and MeH aggregates raised a question about regulation of eEF1A expression in observed cellular stress. eEF1A is one of the most abundant proteins in yeast expressed at more than 500,000 copies per cell. we used non-equilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE) in first dimension and compared cellular protein amounts in MeH expressing and control cells. in the pI range of 4-7 it revealed similar protein expression pattern as using IPG strips, with predominant Ssa protein spots in MeH expressing S. cerevisiae cells. the recombinant MeH protein produced in transgenic carrot plants also had lower molecular weight than the viral protein, suggesting a different glycosylation pattern. however, minor amounts of MeH and MuHN proteins are yet glycosylated in yeast compared to higher eukaryotes. the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is localized in cell cytoplasm. it has several important functions including delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome [33], cytoskeleton organization via actin filament-binding and -bundling activities [34], quality surveillance of newly synthesized proteins [35] and ubiquitin-dependent degradation [36] imply that eEF1A play a role environmental changes such as nutrition, temperature, pH, oxidation and osmolarity induce the expression of both sHsps and large chaperones. in the response to synthesis of recombinant MuHN and MeH, only the large Hsps were upregulated whereas sHsps were not. Hsp26 from S. cerevisiae is a temperature-regulated chaperone [41,42] only after exposure to elevated temperature is Hsp26 able to bind unfolded polypeptides and prevent their aggregation into insoluble complexes. the usual mode of action of sHsps is to bind unfolded nascent proteins and prevent the formation of aggregates. we observed similar interaction between eEF1A and recombinant viral proteins and accumulation of major cytoplasmic stress proteins in the cases of rubella virus glycoprotein E1 and SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein expression in S. cerevisiae. however, identification of the proteins by MS in P. pastoris has not been done. native viral surface protein precursors are transported through ER membrane cotranslationally and depend on SRP, whereas posttranslational insertion in ER membrane does not occur. the use of either SRP-dependent cotranslational or SRP-independent posttranslational translocation pathway in yeast is determined by signal sequence hydrophobicity [50] yeast have no homologues for TRAM, TRAP and some other mammalian accessory factors. we see two possible reasons for inefficient translocation of viral surface proteins in yeast. this is partly due to bottleneck in translocation of viral protein precursors. overexpression of human virus surface protein precursors induces cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR-Cyto) in yeast. the majority of synthesized viral protein accumulates as unglycosylated precursors in the cytosol and forms insoluble aggregates with stress proteins, including Hsps. the cloning strategy of mumps virus HN (MuHN) and measles virus H (MeH) genes was identical to that used for cloning mumps virus NP and measles virus N genes. no published data was available about the recombinant protein, therefore we expressed both the his-tagged and native sequence MuHN gene variants. a single ATG codon in the forward primer and a stop TAA codon in the reverse primer were used. primers containing the SpeI or XbaI sites (in bold) and the start and stop codons were used. the resulting plasmids pFGG3-MeH, pFX7-MuHN and pFX7-MuHN-His6 were cloned into the XbaI site of the vector pFX7 [17] both muHN and MeH genes were also cloned into the AvrII site of P. pastoris vector pPIC3.5K (Invitrogen) for intracellular expression expression experiments were carried out in protease-deficient AH22 derivative pep4 strain and wild-type S. cerevisiae strain FH4. similar results were achieved in all strains tested, but additional data was not included in calculations. is His+ transformants were selected on a minimal agar medium (0.67% YNB, 2% glucose) transformants with a copy number were selected on YEPD-agar plates containing 0.5-1.5 mg/ml G418 (Amresco, Solon, USA) the media and growth conditions for selected P. pastoris transformants were used essentially as suggested by the manufacturers. protein concentrations were determined by Roti-Nanoquant Protein-assay (Carl Roth Gmbh.), which is a modification of Bradford's protein assay. proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane HybondTM;
