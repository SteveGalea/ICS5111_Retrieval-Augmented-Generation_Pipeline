{"summary": "VP6 is a unique structural protein of the middle of three capsid layers of the rotavirus (see Figure 1). it contains 397 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 45 kDa. VP6 is the most conserved, immunogenic, and abundant rotavirus protein. this antigen is considered the major diagnostic marker for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. VLPs are a safe and efficacious class of vaccine, with approved members available for hepatitis B and cervical cancer. the current demand for VLPs is primarily as products for vaccination. other applications, including diagnostics, biomedicine, material science, and nanotechnology, are increasingly attracting general scientific interest. a hexahistidine SUMO fusion construct has been shown to enhance expression and facilitate purification by means of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni+2-NTA) chromatography. traditional gene-fusion systems require engineered cleavage sites, which are recognized by the proteases and are positioned between the fusion tag and the protein target. RNA was extracted from a clinical stool specimen from a 5-year-old patient suffering from acute diarrhea. a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit as previously described by Ushijima et al. PCR products were run on agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. complete nucleotide sequence was determined using the ABI Prism 3130 xl genetic analyzer. cells were grown on nutrient agar plates containing antibiotics. pET15-b, pTRX, and pET-SUMO plasmids encoding recombinant VP6 were cloned into pET15-b, pTRX, and pET-SUMO expression vectors. the PCR product of VP6 was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and purified from a 1% agarose gel using a Qiaex extraction kit. vector primer pair Restriction site pET15-b Fw 5\u2032-CATACATATGGAGGTTCTCTTCTG-3\u2032 NdeI XhoI pET-SUMO Fw 5\u2032-TCACTTAATCAACATGCTTCTG-3\u2032 NdeI XhoI pET-SUMO Fw 5\u2032-TCACTTAATCAACATGCTTCTG-3\u2032 NdeI XhoI Note: Underlined bases correspond to the restriction sites lysozyme was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. samples were incubated in ice for 30 minutes. total proteins in bacteria lysate were applied to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. surfactant Triton X-114 was successfully used to reduce endotoxins during histidine (his) fusion-protein purification. after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes, the bacterial soluble lysate was filtered at 0.22 m and applied to the column at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute to capture the his-SUMO-VP6 fusion proteins. MO-VP6 protein (200 g) was cleaved with 20 U of SUMO protease at 30\u00b0C for 6 hours. the sample was loaded onto a nickel column with Ni-NTA resin. most of the VP6 without 6x His tags was eluted in the flow-through fractions. animals were bled 2 weeks after each boost, and sera from all bleedings were assayed for anti-VP6 antibody titer. Western blot analysis of VP6 protein Recombinant SUMO-VP6 protein purified from the Ni2+-NTA column was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. the purity of the column-purified recombinant SUMO-VP6 and the specificity of the polyclonal animal immunization and sample collection Native VP6 recombinant protein, VP6-VLPs, and VP6-NTs were separately suspended in PBS and scattered by water-bath sonication immediately prior to immunization. female BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with complete Freund adjuvant on day 0 and boosted on days 21 and 42. a goat anti-mouse IgG or IgA was diluted 10,000-fold. the secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was used as a substrate for HRP. cetate solution for 30 seconds in the dark was also removed with filter paper. grids were then air-dried for 1 hour before observation at room temperature. no staining procedure was necessary in this case. tensity analyses were used to determine hydrodynamic radius number distribution (Pn) in different buffer conditions. the mouse experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. the clinical stool sample used for viral RNA extraction had previously been used for diagnostic purposes. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. reaction was carried out with an initial RT step at 45\u00b0C for 30 minutes. reaction was followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. pET15-b, pTRX, and pET-SUMO plasmids were encoding recombinant VP6. pET15-b, pTRX, and pET-SUMO expression vectors are reported in Table 1. the digested PCR fragment of VP6 was ligated into the linearized pET15-b and pTRX expression vectors. the resulting vectors, named pET15b-VP6 and pTRX-VP6, were confirmed by restriction analyses. the resulting vectors were introduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation. this preculture was used to inoculate a 100 mL LB medium. each culture was incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. at 37\u00b0C to an OD measured at 600 nm (A600) of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mM to induce the expression of the recombinant protein at 25\u00b0C for 12 hours. whole-cell lysates were prepared according to the protocol previously described. a chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit was used to determine the amount of LPS in purified VP6 preparation. SUMO-VP6 protein (200 g) was cleaved with 20 U of SUMO protease at 30\u00b0C for 6 hours. most of the VP6 without 6x His tags was eluted in the flow-through fractions. three female mice were immunized in total, with recombinant purified VP6 dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three weeks after the last immunization, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 g of antigen in the presence of incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. preimmune serum collected from the same mouse was used as a control. the membrane was washed three times with blocking solution and twice with Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) antibodies were detected by adding to the membrane SuperSignalTM West Dura extended-duration substrate. VP6 in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer was used to coat flat-bottom microtiter plates. serum samples were diluted to 1:2,000 for IgG detection and 1:200 for IgA detection. plates were washed five times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. we used 20 mM glycine HCl at pH 4.5 and 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid at pH 6, always in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. a small drop (10 L) was dispersed on carbon-coated copper grids. the sample was allowed to adsorb on the carbon film for 5 minutes, and sample excess was removed with filter paper. image analysis was performed using Gwyddion software (Czech Metrology Institute, Brno, Czech Republic). samples were laid down on freshly cleaved mica disks (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA). Dynamic light scattering Dynamic light-scattering measurements on protein solutions were carried out with a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) equipped with a 4 mW He\u2013Ne laser a recent study from Zhao et al reported the in vitro assembly into VLPs of the VP6 protein expressed in E. coli. however, the VP6 protein accumulates in the bacterial cell as insoluble aggregates. a complicated renaturation process is required to restore the native folding, which is competent to self-assemble in VLPs. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of VP6 fusion proteins expression in Escherichia coli. lane 1, protein marker; lane 2, soluble cell extract from the uninduced culture transformed with pET15b-VP6; lane 3, soluble cell extract from the uninduced culture transformed with pET-SUMO-VP6; lane 7, soluble cell extract of the induced culture transformed with pET-SUMO a moderate quantity of recombinant protein (20%) was present in the soluble fraction. the SUMO-VP6 fusion protein was eluted in the presence of 300 mM imidazole. the final yield obtained was exceptionally high. a small volume of 250 mL of isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) culture transformed with pET-SUMO-VP6 was lysed in 10 mL lysis buffer and applied to 1.5 mL of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. after an extensive wash, the fusion protein was eluted with a 10-column volume of elution buffer and collected proteolytic cleavage of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-VP6 fusion proteins. SUMO was retained in the Ni2+ resin because it contained an His6 tag. western blot analysis of purified SUMO-VP6 and cleaved VP6 after protease digestion. native VP6 protein was stored overnight at 4\u00b0C to check for possible formations of protein precipitates. the day after, the sample was completely clear, and no precipitates were visible after high-speed centrifugation. SUMO is promoting the solubility through its attachment to the N-terminal of these proteins. the TEM micrograph shows long rods with a lateral dimension of 40\u2013100 nm. the bar at the bottom corresponds to 500 nm. the TEM image reveals the presence of small spots compatible with the expected presence of VP6 trimers. elongated structures that are a few micron in length and with a lateral dimension in the order of 40\u2013100 nm may be indicative of the formation of NTs. TEM image of the sample at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 200 mM CaCl2 shows a condition disfavoring the formation of ordered structures. a typical NT, revealed at pH 6, is shown in 2-D and 3-D representations. in this condition, we observed long rods with a contour length in the range of about 5\u201310 mm and a thickness around 100 nm. the images obtained using TEM and AFM techniques were collected directly from the samples after dialysis to the desired pH. NT-VP6-specific serum IgA antibodies were slightly stimulated by the three VP6 formulations. NTs were the most immunogenic among the different nanoconstructs. the tubular structural conformation is the most immunogenic one. expression of VP6 fusion proteins from human rotavirus A has been expressed in several eukaryotic vector systems. the VP6 protein accumulates in the bacterial cell as insoluble aggregates. a complicated renaturation process is required to restore the native folding. soluble and insoluble fractions of induced and uninduced bacteria were assessed by SDS-PAGE. soluble and insoluble fractions of induced and uninduced bacteria were assessed. pET-SUMO-VP6 fusion tag was observed to have a lower enhancement of total expression, but a moderate quantity of recombinant protein (20%) was present in the soluble fraction. elution profile of the first five fractions (over ten) is reported as a 10% SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue. VP6 runs as a single band of about 55 kDa, obtaining a purity greater than 99%. the final yield obtained was exceptionally high, estimated at a value equal to 50 mg/L. the fusion protein was incubated with SUMO protease at 30\u00b0C for 6 hours. the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SUMO-VP6 was found to be cleaved almost completely. cleavage-reaction mixture was reapplied to the affinity column. aved fusion protein was purified in the pass-through fraction with 99% homogeneity (Figure 4, lane 4). VP6 recovered from flow-through (after passage through Ni2+-NTA resin) is untagged, recognition of cleaved VP6 protein by immunoblot was carried out using the specific anti-VP6 antiserum produced in mice. the TEM micrograph shows nearly spherical nanoparticles with a diameter size variability that has been estimated to be 6015 nm. the bar at the bottom corresponds to 200 nm. the bar at the bottom corresponds to 50 nm. the homogeneity seems quite high, with few particles forming small aggregates being clearly visible. in Figure 5B, a zoom of a single particle is shown to appreciate the morphology and the geometry of this VLP. in this case, elongated structures with a lateral dimension in the order of 40\u2013100 nm may be indicative of the formation of NTs. a typical ellipsoidal shape detected, showing a representative single particle at pH 4.5, and a 3-D representation of the same image. a typical NT, revealed at pH 6, is shown in 2-D and 3-D representations (Figure 6, B and D) a typical NT is shown in 2-D and 3-D representations. inoculated mice were examined for total serum rotavirus VP6-specific IgG and IgA antibodies at 3 and 6 weeks after the initial immunization. NT-VP6 particle immunization resulted in a relatively higher level of IgG response. termination sera were tested in ELISA at twofold dilutions. different antigen formulations administered to four mice per experimental group are reported on the x-axis. the cutoff for positive values was 0.2. tubular structures administered to mice may have longer circulation times than spherical particles. a deeper knowledge of their physicochemical properties may be helpful to obtain the best compromise between stability and immunogenicity. ijn-9-2727s1.tif (111.5KB, tif) diluted 1:10 in BS (red dots)."}
