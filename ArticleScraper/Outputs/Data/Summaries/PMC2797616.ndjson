{"summary": "autophagy has no measurable role in vacuolar escape and intracellular growth in primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages deficient for autophagy (atg5/). however, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy following infection by L. monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, facultative intracellular, food-borne pathogen. it causes severe disease in pregnant and immunocompromised hosts. the intracellular life cycle of L. monocytogenes has been described in detail. autophagy is a mechanism by which cytoplasmic components, including long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, are enveloped within specialized double-membrane-bound vesicles. it has been hypothesized that basal levels of autophagy occur continuously inside of cells [20] an increase in autophagic activity can be stimulated by amino acid starvation, hormone signaling, cytokines, TLR stimulation and immunity related GTPases. authors of this study did not observe that wild-type L. monocytogenes grew better in atg5 / MEFs than in wild-type MEFs. however, the role of Atg5 in the control of wild-type L. monocytogenes replication remains controversial. re-evaluated the hypothesis that primary macrophages use autophagy as a defense against invading L. monocytogenes. either autophagy has no role in control of L. monocytogenes replication or that an as yet undiscovered bacterial virulence factor effectively circumvents autophagy. autophagy is induced by wild-type, actA, plcAB but not by hly or heat-killed L. monocytogenes. BMDMs were infected with wild-type, hly, actA, plcAB mutant L. monocytogenes and heat-killed L. monocytogenes. LC3-GFP co-localizes with wild-type L. monocytogenes. hly (LLO-minus) bacteria showed no detectable colocalization with LC3-GFP. LC3-GFP was either targeting phagosomes damaged by LLO pores. ium Bacillus subtilis engineered to express and secrete LLO or a related cholesterol dependent cytolysin, perfringolysin O. modified bacteria have previously been shown to escape into the host cell cytosol. LC3-GFP BMDMs 40 minutes post-infection with either wild-type or cytolysin expressing B. subtilis (red) images are representative of results obtained in 3 independent experiments. bar = 2 m. (D) stills from time-lapse video microscopy of B. subtilis (red) expressing LLO in LC3-GFP BMDMs. liposomes encapsulating HK-LLO showed less than 2% colocalization with LC3 at the same time point. only 10% of phagosomes harboring LLO-loaded liposomes are competent to rupture. 8% was not statistically significantly different from this 10% expectation. 2% was statistically significantly different from both expected (10%) and observed (8%) values. the capacity of L. monocytogenes to escape from phagocytic vacuoles was examined in both fibroblasts and macrophages that lacked functional autophagy. the presence of autophagy had no measurable effect on escape rates in bone marrow-derived macrophages. bacterial mutants lacking the secreted phospholipases that contribute to vacuolar escape had similar levels of cytosolic entry in both wild-type and atg5/ solid line, closed circles: wild-type MEF infected with wild-type L. monocytogenes; large dashed line, closed squares: atg5/ MEFs infected with plcAB mutant L. monocytogenes. data shown are representative of results obtained in 3 independent experiments. hly (LLO-minus) L. monocytogenes and heat-killed bacteria stimulated almost no LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, as compared to wild-type L. monocytogenes over a 60 minute time course of infection. however, wild-type bacteria secreting LLO induced increased amounts of autophagy. hly, actA, plcAB mutant and heat-killed L. monocytogenes co-localized with LC3. hly (LLO-minus) bacteria showed no detectable colocalization with LC3-GFP. LC3-GFP co-localizes with wild-type and mutant L. monocytogenes. Graphs are representative of results obtained in three independent experiments. bar = 2 m. LLO and PFO expression by Bacillus subtilis induced bacteria-targeted autophagy. results support observation that LLO is required for LC3-GFP colocalization with L. monocytogenes. western blot for LC3I lipidation in BMDMs infected with either wild-type B. subtilis or B. subtilis engineered to express LLO or PFO. LC3 colocalization in BMDMs infected with either wild-type B. subtilis or B. subtilis engineered to express LLO or PFO. liposomes encapsulating wild-type LLO had a peak of LC3 colocalization (8%) at 25 minutes post-infection. liposomes encapsulating HK-LLO showed less than 2% colocalization with LC3 at the same time point. liposomes encapsulating HK-LLO showed less than 2% colocalization with LC3 at the same time point. data shown are representative of results obtained in 3 independent experiments. the capacity of L. monocytogenes to escape from phagocytic vacuoles was examined in both fibroblasts and macrophages that lacked functional autophagy. decreased escape observed in atg5/ MEFs suggests that under some conditions, autophagy may enhance, rather than prevent, bacterial escape. the decreased escape observed in atg5/ MEFs suggests that under some conditions, autophagy may enhance, rather than prevent, bacterial escape. atg5/ BMDM infected with wild-type L. monocytogenes. data shown are representative of results obtained in 3 independent experiments. the presence of damaged membranes alone is sufficient to induce LC3 colocalization. previous studies have provided evidence that L. monocytogenes triggers autophagy, and that autophagy limits bacterial replication [23], [24], [43] further, bacterial mutants lacking the pore-forming cytolysin LLO fail to trigger autophagy. the majority of wild-type L. monocytogenes escape the vacuole within the first 30 minutes following entry. phospholipase mutants have a known defect in escape from a secondary vacuole. phospholipase mutants have a known defect in escape from a secondary vacuole. autophagic bodies were identified inside of cells exposed to VCC [52]. non-specific induction of autophagy in response to VacA was blocked. further autophagic induction in response to VacA was blocked when the channel forming activity of the toxin was inhibited. atg5/ mice were grown on brain-heart infusion (IPTG) agar without antibiotics. the cells were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. the cells reached approximately 80% confluency. s (2108 L. monocytogenes and 1106 MEFs) were washed three times 30 minutes post-infection with room temperature PBS containing calcium and magnesium. gentamicin was added at a concentration of 50 g/mL one hour post-infection. cells were washed twice with PBS containing calcium and magnesium. cells were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% BSA) coverslips were fixed in fresh media containing 1 mM IPTG and 50 g/mL gentamicin. the percentage of escape was determined by dividing the number of intracellular green fluorescent bacteria by the number of total intracellular bacteria. the percentage of escape was determined by dividing the number of escaped (escaped) bacteria by the number of total intracellular bacteria. membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse monoclonal anti-LC3 antibody. washed three times for 10 minutes with TBST followed by one wash. membrane was washed three times for 10 minutes with TBST. intracellular Growth Curves An MOI of 51 L. monocytogenes was used to infect BMDMs (1107 bacteria and 2106 BMDMs) images were collected and color-combined using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) images were compiled in Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA) hly (DP-L2161; [55]), actA (DP-L3078; [56]) and plcAB (DP-L1936; [46]) mutants contained in-frame deletions of respective genes in the 10403s background. wild-type Bacillus subtilis strain used was DP-B1066 [30] single colonies of the L. monocytogenes were inoculated into 2 mL of BHI broth and grown overnight at 30\u00b0C without shaking. BMDMs were washed three times 30 minutes post-infection with room temperature PBS containing calcium and magnesium. gentamicin was added at 60 minutes post-infection. a range of MOIs from 461 to 691 of Alexa Fluor 594 labeled B. subtilis was used to infect LC3-GFP BMDMs. the infection was completed in presence of 1 mM IPTG. cells were washed twice with PBS containing calcium and magnesium. f-actin stained with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-phalloidin. both primary and secondary antibodies as well as phalloidin were incubated. gels were run in 1 X 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid buffer (Invitrogen) gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane at 15V for 1 hour on a Trans-Blot Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) membrane was blocked for 1 hour with mouse monoclonal anti-LC3 antibody diluted 11 with PBS. mouse monoclonal (clone GTU-88, Sigma catalogue no. T6557) was used as a loading control. Westerns were repeated three independent times. microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX-70 or IX-80 microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera. samples were loaded onto a stage heated to 37\u00b0C by a fan. media was changed every 60 minutes during long time sequences."}
