{"summary": "the world health organization declared the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders possibly associated with ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the end of 2016, the unprecedented ZIKV outbreak affected 48 countries and territories in the Americas with more than half a million human cases. viraemia is typically short-lived (3\u20137 days after onset of symptoms) [6-8], although an increased window of detection has been observed using urine (up to 20 days after onset of a risk assessment by the WHO regional office for Europe (WHO/Europe) indicated that the risk for an outbreak with ZIKV in Europe should not be underestimated. a country\u2019s ability to robustly detect ZIKV introduction and local transmission is important to minimise the risk for a ZIKV outbreak. the assessment was done by an in-depth questionnaire in May 2016. 49 laboratories from 30 EU/EEA countries completed the questionnaire. 44 laboratories in 27 countries indicated they were conducting ZIKV diagnostics by May 2016. one country indicated in January 2017 that they had implemented ZIKV diagnostics since May 2016. pregnant employees were not allowed to perform ZIKV diagnostic tests. in six of the 33 laboratories that answered this question, pregnant employees were not allowed to perform ZIKV diagnostic tests. a restriction for pregnant employees was limited to handling ZIKV virus culture. most laboratories (26/44) indicated that they could directly contact physicians to ask for more information about the requested samples or look up record sheets and laboratory reports. the realStar Zika virus RT-PCR kit by Altona (Hamburg, Germany) diagnostics was the most widely used commercial test (24/30) serology was conducted in 24 countries and in 33 of 44 laboratories with ZIKV diagnostics all of which had previous experience with serology-based diagnostics. ten laboratories in 10 countries were able to assess the presence of ZIKV neutralising antibodies by plaque reduction neutralisation (PRNT) and/or virus neutralisation (VNT) tests. five laboratories had accreditation ISO 17025 (\u2018General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories\u2019), while two laboratories indicated that they operated under a national quality accreditation system. five reference laboratories had no accreditation at all (data not shown) analysis at country level showed 10 of 27 countries with reference laboratories with ISO 15189 accreditation, five countries with laboratories with a national accreditation, two countries with laboratories with both ISO 15189 and ISO 17025 accreditation, two countries with laboratories with either ISO 15189 or no accreditation. CHIKV patients 16 12 samples (9.75; 20) Confirmed YFV, JEV or TBEV vaccinated 15 20 samples (10; 43) EBV panel 10 15 samples (10; 45) CMV panel 10 15 samples (10; 45) Malaria panel 9 22 samples (10; 34) Population panel endemic region 4 12.5 samples (8.25; 136.25) Pregnancy panel 7 100 samples (39; 100) for 8 of 44 laboratories, the cumulative number of requests was approximately two or three times the indicated weekly capacity. for three laboratories, it exceeded their capacity (five to 10-fold) for serology, a vast majority of the laboratories had a cumulative number of requests for the 18-week period. eight laboratories referred to their national ZIKV diagnostic algorithm. one laboratory indicated that asymptomatic patients were never tested regardless of pregnancy status. the main indicated obstacles were the availability of a positive control and validation materials for molecular and serological tests. eight laboratories indicated BSL3 as their operational biosafety level, while two laboratories performed ZIKV diagnostics at BSL1. reasons given by laboratories to deviate from the official level were (i) downgrading because diagnosis did not involve high titre virus culture (one laboratory), and upgrading based on in-house assessment of biosafety and biosecurity issues. a likert scale with 1\u20135 range (1 = never, 5 = always) how often certain essential background information about their patient samples was provided with the diagnostic requests. the provision of the date of sampling was scored the highest (40/44 laboratories scored this in category \u2018often\u2019 or \u2018always\u2019) twenty-two laboratories indicated that they used another positive control, but not the specific source. eighteen of 43 laboratories used ZIKV strains of the current outbreak in the Americas as a control, while 14 used strains belonging to the original (pre-2015) Asian lineage. 10 had access to more than one ZIKV lineage as control. thirty of 33 laboratories used in-house assays, including ELISA (2/13) and/or immunofluorescence assays (IFA) (6/13), as well as VNT (7/13) and PRNT (3/13) the majority of these laboratories (12/13) indicated that they obtained their positive control material from own patient samples. four of 13 laboratories were provided with ZIKV positive control samples by collaborators. thirty-seven of 44 laboratories indicated that they were willing to share validation data with other laboratories. 15 of the 44 ZIKV diagnostic laboratories indicated that their accreditation scheme did not accept validation done elsewhere. this would be a possible option for 22 of 44 laboratories. ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFA: immunofluorescence assay; VNT: virus neutralisation test; PRNT: plaque reduction neutralisation test. for 33 of 44 laboratories, the cumulative number of requests in the 18-week period covered in the questionnaire remained below their indicated capacity per week. for three laboratories, it exceeded their capacity (five to 10-fold) ten of the 44 diagnostic laboratories performed both molecular and serological tests on the available samples, three always carried out serology, two always performed RT-PCR, while three only conducted the tests that were asked for by the clinician. ten laboratories either asked for more information or an additional sample from the patient for an interpretation based on kinetics. the coverage for ZIKV serology increased from 17 EU/EEA countries to 24. access to ZIKV serology is particularly important because the confirmation or ruling out of a ZIKV infection during pregnancy is essential for medical follow-up regarding the teratogenicity of ZIKV. Virus neutralisation is still considered the most specific flavivirus serology test. cross-reactivity can be observed in patients with other flavivirus infections. Molecular testing relied in 21 of 44 laboratories only on commercial assays, in 14 laboratories only on in-house testing and in nine laboratories on both commercial and in-house testing. the overall ZIKV diagnostic capacity in the 30 EU/EEA countries appeared to be sufficient, given the total number of reported requests vs the indicated capacities. at country level, the extent of under/overcapacities varied and were complicated by the fact that laboratories with certain ISO accreditations are bound by strict regulations when sending a surplus of samples to a backup laboratory. national and/or EU contingency funding should be established to ensure adequate and robust laboratory preparedness and response."}
