{"summary": "inhibition of Drak2, a serine-threonine kinase, may be an alternative approach to inhibiting autoreactive T cells without acting as an immunosuppressant. the reduced accumulation of autoreactive T cells is due to an increased susceptibility to death of the Drak2 -/- T cells. the interaction of Drak2 and the TGF-RI is an intriguing possibility to explain how Drak2 contributes to autoimmunity. the absence of Drak2 in T cells may render these cells more susceptible to TGF- signaling, which could prevent autoimmunity. mice were previously described and backcrossed 19 generations to C57BL/6. OT-I mice were previously described and backcrossed 19 generations to C57BL/6. suspensions stained with antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, CD25, CD45.1, and CD45.2 (eBioscience and BioLegend) cell death and viability was determined utilizing Annexin V (BD Biosciences) or Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cells were stimulated in vitro for two days with 100pM OVA257 peptide-pulsed, CD45.1 splenocytes that were irradiated at 3000 rads. cells were harvested, washed, and replated with nave splenocytes in the presence of 5ng/ml TGF- (R&D Systems), with or without 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-2 (BD Biosciences), IL in vitro Treg induction Nave CD4+ cells were purified and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 for 72 hours with 20ng/ml IL-2. cells were stimulated with 1g/ml anti-CD3 coated on polyl-lysine-coated coverglass slides. protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay. equal amounts of protein were denatured in sample buffer (10% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.2M Tris HCl, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue) OT-I mice were previously described and backcrossed 19 generations to C57BL/6. suspensions stained with antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, CD25, CD45.1, and CD45.2 (eBioscience and BioLegend) cell death and viability was determined utilizing Annexin V (BD Biosciences) or Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cells were stimulated in vitro for two days with 100pM OVA257 peptide-pulsed, CD45.1 splenocytes. cells were harvested, washed, and replated with nave splenocytes. two days later, fresh media and cytokines were added. fluorescent microscopy Wildtype and Drak2 -/- CD4+ cells were negatively selected with Miltenyi beads. cells were stimulated with 1g/ml anti-CD3 coated on polyl-lysine-coated coverglass slides and 1g/ml soluble anti-CD28. protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific) equal amounts of protein were denatured in sample buffer (10% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.2M Tris HCl, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue), separated by SDS-PAGE. wildtype and Drak2-/- CD4+ cells were negatively selected with Miltenyi magnetic beads and stimulated on anti-CD3-coated coverglass slides. half of the cells were treated with TGF- for the final 20 minutes of culture. wildtype and Drak2-/- splenocytes were stimulated for 2 hours with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. the cells were harvested, stained with antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, and pSmad2/3, and analyzed by flow cytometry. OT-II and OT-II.Drak2 -/- CD4+ T cells were stimulated with OVA323-pulsed splenocytes in the presence or absence of TGF-. the number of live, divided CD4+ T cells decreased in response to TGF-. cells were purified from OT-I and OT-I.Drak2-/- mice. cells were stimulated with splenocytes loaded with 100pM OVA257 peptide. two days later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. addition of TGF- abrogated the survival effects of IL-15, but not IL-2 and IL-7. ability of TGF- to oppose the effects of IL-15 was comparable between wildtype and Drak2-/- T cells. TGF-mediated differentiation of induced regulatory T cells is not altered in the absence of Drak2. the addition of TGF- increased Foxp3 expression, indicative of regulatory T cell induction. this suggests that TGF- functions similarly in wildtype and Drak2 -/- T cells. compared to wildtype T cells is independent of TGF- signaling in vitro. we previously showed that Drak2 -/- T cells exhibit enhanced susceptibility to death in vivo. this promotes resistance to type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Enhanced susceptibility to death in the Drak2 -/- T cells is independent of TGF- signaling in vitro. the percent of nonviable CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is shown. the addition of TGF- during the final 20 minutes of culture elicited Smad2 translocation into the nucleus of both wildtype and Drak2 -/- T cells. there were no differences in Smad2 translocation between wildtype and wildtype T cells in response to exogenous TGF-. wildtype and Drak2 -/- splenocytes were stimulated for 2 hours with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, with or without 2 ng/ml TGF- for one additional hour. the cells were harvested, stained with antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, and pSmad2/3, and analyzed by flow cytometry. the effect of TGF- inhibition was comparable between wildtype and Drak2 -/- T cells. however, the effect of TGF- inhibition was comparable between OT-I and OT-II.Drak2 -/- T cells. CD4+CD25-CD44lo CD62Lhi nave cells were purified from OT-I and OT-I.Drak2-/- mice and stimulated with irradiated splenocytes loaded with 10M OVA323 peptide. two days later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. OT-I and OT-I.Drak2 -/- cells were stimulated with splenocytes for two days. cells were then washed and cultured with exogenous IL-2, IL-7, or IL-15 for an additional four days. addition of TGF- decreased the number of live CD8+ T cells compared to culture in media alone. cells were harvested and replated at equal numbers with or without various cytokine combinations. cells were obtained from one OT-I or OT-I.Drak2-/- mouse. lo nave cells were purified from wildtype and Drak2-/- mice. they were stimulated with 1g/ml anti-CD3 and 1g/ml anti-CD28. there was no significant difference in the response of the wildtype and Drak2-/- cells according to the Mann-Whitney U-test. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified from wildtype, Drak2 -/-, DNRII, and DNRII.Drak2 -/- mice. the purified T cells were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. the increased death in the Drak2 -/- T cells is not due to increased TGF- signaling. TGF- is a multifunctional cytokine that controls many aspects of T cell behavior. enhanced TGF- signaling in Drak2 -/- T cells could contribute to resistance to autoimmune disease in the Drak2 -/- mice. the role of Drak2 in cell lines may not mimic its role under physiological conditions. it is important to investigate molecular mechanisms of Drak2 in primary T cells. this is the cells relevant to the induction or resistance to autoimmunity."}
