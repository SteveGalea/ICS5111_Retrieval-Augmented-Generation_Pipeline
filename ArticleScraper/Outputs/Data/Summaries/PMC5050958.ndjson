{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is defined as severe neuroinflammation of the central nervous system following infection with mosquito-borne flavivirus JE virus. the potential contribution of CCR5 to JE progression via mediating CD4+Foxp3+ Treg homing has not been investigated. adoption of sorted CCR5+CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs into Ccr5/ mice could ameliorate JE progression without altering the viral burden and CNS infiltration of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells. instead, adoptive transfer of sorted CCR5+CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs into Ccr5/ mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-)"}
