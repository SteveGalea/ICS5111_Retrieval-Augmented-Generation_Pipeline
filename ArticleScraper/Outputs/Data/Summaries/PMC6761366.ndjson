{"summary": "the goal of personal protective equipment (PPE) is to protect healthcare personnel and patients from body fluids and infectious organisms via contact, droplet, or airborne transmission. the critical importance of using PPE properly is highlighted by 2 potentially fatal viral infections, where HCP became infected while caring for patients due to errors in the use of PPE. however, PPE in dealing with less dangerous, but highly infectious organisms is important as well. 48 observations of randomly selected HCP were performed at a university-based medical center with the hospital PPE guidelines used as the expectation for proper gown use. only 42% of HCP appropriately tied their gowns in the back, and subsequently removed the gowns by breaking the tie. the observations indicated that a large number of participants were at risk of contamination. iterative changes were made to the standard gown, piloted, and then discussed by 4 members of the research team until a final prototype was developed. redesigned gown reduces the likelihood of procedural nonadherence during clinical tasks and doffing. doffing gowns were classified as adherent or nonadherent per hospital policy. standardized instructional materials were used to train 3 coders to identify nonadherence in the recordings. subjective measures assessed participants\u2019 perceptions of the gown. participants performed 2 scenarios with a different gown (standard or redesigned) made available prior to the start of each scenario. each participant responded to the survey rating the 2 gowns and provided any additional verbal comments. the redesigned gown reduces the likelihood of procedural nonadherence during clinical tasks and doffing. the usability and effectiveness of the redesigned gown was evaluated in comparison to the standard gown. measures Behavioral and subjective measures were used to assess the effectiveness and usability of the redesigned gown. participants were asked to rate gowns on attributes of ease of use during donning, clinical care, doffing, convenience, design, comfort, and risk of contamination. participants completed a consent form and survey to describe their professional background and experience. simulated patients were in isolation precautions with signage posted outside the patient room indicating the required PPE. participants performed 2 scenarios, with a different gown (standard or redesigned) made available prior to the start of each scenario. port. 5 Inspect catheter integrity after removal; note tip integrity and length. transport graduate container to commode. 8 Discard supplies, remove gloves, gown, and perform hand hygiene. 3 coders were trained to identify nonadherence in the recordings. subjects assessed participants\u2019 perceptions of the redesigned gown. workload and usability were measured using the NASA-TLX. participants performed 2 scenarios with a different gown (standard or redesigned) made available prior to the start of each scenario. each participant responded to the survey rating the 2 gowns and provided any additional verbal comments. RESULTS Redesigned Gown Prototype Our main gown redesign considerations focused on improving the closure mechanism. the gown secured by pulling a single strap from the back to front. an adhesive strip covered by red tape was placed at the end of the strap. performance-related issues during task performance occurred on average 0.9 times (standard deviation [SD],.9) with the standard gown, and 1.2 times (SD,.76) with the redesigned gown. statistical analyses were performed for the frequency of nonadherence. the redesigned gown rated higher than the standard gown for all gown attributes. the difference was smallest with regard to ease of use in clinical care and comfort. asymmetrical closure approach was favored, with the gown secured by pulling a single strap from the back to front. an adhesive strip covered by red tape allowed for strap securement to the front of the gown. initial designs ranged from a different-colored inside gown material to applying tape to mark the clean surface. Behavioral Measures Analyses focused on the percentage of procedural nonadherence during donning (eg, standard gown not secured, redesigned gown strap taped in back) and doffing (eg, unties standard gown) were analyzed using rate per gown type. performance-related issues during task performance occurred on average 0.9 times (standard deviation [SD],.9) with the standard gown. the redesigned gown rated higher than the standard gown for all gown attributes. the difference was smallest with regard to ease of use in clinical care and comfort. Counts and Percentages of Concerns and Valence of Gown Attributes for the standard and redesigned gown as Expressed by participants at the end of the study. participants described positive attributes of the redesign while expressing some concerns. study suggests that the best predictor for changes in organizational performance is actual technology use, not technology investment [15] adherence could increase, but it will take longer observations to observe such change. a next step in evaluating the redesigned gown would be to introduce the gown in the clinical context. this work is part of a broader human factors initiative of introducing a sociotechnical perspective into infection prevention and control. there is clear benefit from adopting such perspective."}
