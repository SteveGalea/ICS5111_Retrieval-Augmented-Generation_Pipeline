{"summary": "novel human pathogens are emerging from wildlife at increasing rates (1, 2). recent efforts to understand this phenomenon have focused on identifying microorganisms with zoonotic potential. but not all pathogens possess equal zoonotic potential. multihost pathogens and RNA viruses are significantly more likely to cause zoonoses than pathogens of other classes. phylogeny of known simian arteriviruses (D) with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) phylogeny. maximum likelihood trees were generated using MEGA6.06. bootstrap values of less than 70 are not shown. these viruses all contain a duplication of 3 to 4 open reading frames (ORFs) in the 3\u2032-proximal half of the genome that is not observed in other arteriviruses (13). these additional ORFs putatively express additional structural proteins that are thought to be required for replication, but their precise function is not understood. simian arterivirus-induced pathology is not specific to macaques. at least three highly divergent simian arteriviruses were responsible for past outbreaks of SHF, suggesting that the simian arteriviruses possess features that facilitate transmission among primates of different species. simian arteriviruses from each species share only 50% nucleotide identity with one another or SHFV. simian arteriviruses from each species share only 50% nucleotide identity with one another. simian arterivirus infections occur in black-and-white colobus monkeys. lack of detection suggests simian arterivirus infection in african monkey populations may be variable. some biological features are thought to potentiate zoonotic transmission of RNA viruses. analyses have been used to quantify the diversity of a virus at the family, genus, species, species, strain, or isolate level. simian arteriviruses display an impressive degree of diversity, even in comparison to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus known for its high genetic diversity also found in africa primates. the extent and type of contact between humans and wild nonhuman primates in africa vary by geographic region, local customs, and the specific primate species in question. many groups come into contact with monkeys through hunting, butchering, and consuming bush meat. the host factors that influence zoonosis are myriad and highly virus specific. simian arterivirus persistence in natural hosts may be mediated, in part, by genetic plasticity and mutational escape of host immune responses. simian arterivirus persistence in natural hosts does not guarantee that these properties would be maintained in zoonotic human infections. however, high-titer replication and genetic plasticity could also facilitate rapid adaptation to a human host. genetic diversity of known simian arteriviruses poses formidable technical barrier to such an analysis. screening of additional primate populations will be essential to resolve the genetic diversity, host range, geographic distribution, and natural history of simian arteriviruses. unbiased deep sequencing will undoubtedly play a major role in this effort. clinically, SHF is characterized by fever, facial edema, cyanosis, cyanosis, anorexia, adipsia, vomiting, dehydration, and signs of hemorrhagic disease (e.g., melena, petechiae, subcutaneous hematoma, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and epistaxis) captive patas monkeys inoculated experimentally with SHFV developed significant signs of disease (25), demonstrating that simian arterivirus-induced pathology is not specific to macaques. despite the widely held suspicion that African monkeys were the natural reservoir for SHFV, it was not until 2011 that the first SHFV-like viruses were discovered in a wild animal. simian arteriviruses from each species share only 50% nucleotide identity with one another or SHFV. simian arteriviruses from each species share only 50% nucleotide identity with one another or SHFV. simian arterivirus biology and zoonotic potential of a virus can be inferred from its biological properties alone. certain biological features are thought to potentiate zoonotic transmission of RNA viruses. these features include, but are not limited to, high genetic diversity, the ability to overcome host restriction factors, high virus production within infected animals. simian arteriviruses display high levels of intrahost diversity (9) in wild monkeys studied to date, simian arteriviruses display high levels of intrahost diversity. high virus production in naturally infected animal hosts may also facilitate cross-species transmission by increasing the dose of virus transferred to recipient host. host phylogenetic relatedness may serve as a rough proxy for susceptibility to cross-species viral infection. some RNA viruses (e.g., filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and influenza A viruses) have a very broad species tropism. others (e.g., lentiviruses, hepaciviruses, and pegiviruses) appear to be highly host species restricted (37\u201340) titer replication and genetic plasticity could also facilitate rapid adaptation to a human host. there exists the possibility for synergy among coinfecting pathogens and simian arteriviruses. lack of documented human infection should not be taken as evidence for lack of zoonotic potential. unbiased deep sequencing may become useful in screening for simian arterivirus infections in humans. the recent discovery of multiple highly diverse and prevalent simian arteriviruses in primates across sub-saharan Africa highlights how little we know about these viruses. understanding why certain viruses do not emerge in humans may also hold value for refining our understanding of the factors that drive zoonotic transmission of RNA viruses. ilwaukee was approved by
