{"summary": "cervical tumors often recur after surgery and/or radiotherapy (5, 6) it is critical to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies that completely eliminate the tumor cells. studies in animal models have already shown that HPV16-specific CTLs can safely eradicate HPV16-transformed tumor cells in vivo (10) the HSPs have shown promising results and are being heavily pursued as tools with which to develop effective and safer CaCx vaccines. a larger HSP, HSP110, is better suited for use in recombinant vaccines (22, 23) HLA-A2 is the most frequent HLA-A specificity in the human population. about 50.7% of random individuals in the population in china carry HLA-A2. peptide vaccines based on this haplotype may have a particularly potent impact on the global HPV threat. the eukaryotic expression plasmid HLA-A2/Kb expressing the 1 and 2 domains of HLA-A*0201 and the 3 domain of H-2Kb (plasmid number 14906; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) was transfected into the TC-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. the cells were selected by addition of 500 g/ml G418 (Sangon, Shanghai, China) and maintained as previously described. peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 20\u00b0C. expression, purification, and identification of recombinant proteins. mHSP110 cDNA was cloned into the pQE-80L vector. rabbit anti-HSP110 or anti-mHSP70 polyclonal antibody was the primary antibody. a chemiluminescence kit was used to detect the target protein band. the noncovalent complex of mHSP110-HPV E711-20 was generated. mHSP110-E711-20 complex (100 g mHSP110 plus 50 g E711-20), mHSP70-E711-20 complex (100 g mHSP70 plus 50 g E711-20), 100 g of mHSP110 alone, 100 g of mHSP70 alone, 50 g of E711-20 alone, or 100 l PBS. all mice were immunized twice, with the initial immun immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with peptide E711-20 (10 g/ml) and murine interleukin 2 (10 U/ml) at day 5 of culture, the viable splenocytes were used as effector cells. the splenocytes were cocultured with 5 104 target cells at different levels. effector/target cell ratios of 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1 in 96-well V-bottom culture plates at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. after 4 h of incubation, the supernatants (50 l/well) were removed and the substrate mix (50 l/well) was added. sample absorbance at a 490-nm wavelength was measured by an ELISA plate reader. antigen-specific IFN--secreting T cells were detected by a mouse IFN--precoated ELISPOT kit (Dakewei, Shenzhen, China) the precoated plate was activated by adding Lympho-Spot serum-free medium. tumors were established by s.c. injection of 5 105 TC-1/A2Kb cells into the right flank of HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice (day 0) on day 5, mice with obvious tumor development were assigned arbitrarily into 8 groups of 10. survival of mice was recorded daily for each group. 1 and 2 domains of HLA-A*0201 and 3 domains of H-2Kb (plasmid number 14906; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) were transfected into the TC-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the cells were selected by addition of 500 g/ml G418 (Sangon, Shanghai, China) and maintained as previously described (35). s were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 20\u00b0C. expression, purification, and identification of recombinant proteins. mHSP110 cDNA was cloned into the pQE-80L vector. polyclonal antibody (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI) as primary antibody. chemiluminescence kit (Roche Diagnostics Limited, Shanghai, China) was used to detect target protein band. mHSP110-HPV E711-20 complex was generated according to previously published protocol for binding mHSP110 with peptide E749-57 (29) mHSP70-E711-20 complex (100 g mHSP70 plus 50 g E711-20), 100 g of mHSP110 alone, 100 g of mHSP70 alone, 50 g of E711-20 alone, or 100 l PBS. all mice were immunized twice, with initial immunization occurring on day 0 and the booster given 14 days later. immunized mice were cultured (2 104 cells/well, 100 l) in triplicate in 96-well culture plates in the presence of the E711-20 peptide for 5 days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the number of viable cells was then determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test kit. 96-well V-bottom culture plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. after 4 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 l of stop solution (1 M acetic acid) sample absorbance at a 490-nm wavelength was measured by an ELISA plate reader. antigen-specific IFN--secreting T cells were detected by a mouse IFN--precoated ELISPOT kit (Dakewei, Shenzhen, China) the precoated plate was activated by adding Lympho-Spot serum-free medium. s.c. injection of 5 105 TC-1/A2Kb cells into the right flank of HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice (day 0) on day 5, mice with obvious tumor development were assigned arbitrarily into 8 groups of 10. mice were then i.p. injected with different immunization formulations (150 l total volume in PBS) on days 5, 9, and 14. survival of mice was recorded daily for each group. mHSP110 or mHSP70 could complex with the FITC-E711-20 peptides. when the complex was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, no fluorescent signal was observed at the position corresponding to the mHSP110 band. however, when the complex was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, no fluorescent signal was observed at the position corresponding to the mHSP110 band. the mHSP70-E711-20 complex and the CFA-emulsified E711-20 peptide primed similar lymphocyte proliferation levels. the spleen cells from mice immunized with mHSP110, mHSP70, and E711-20 did not stimulate significant cell proliferation after in vitro restimulation. mHSP70-E711-20 complex and the CFA-emulsified E711-20 peptide stimulated much higher IFN- production than the immunogens E711-20, mHSP110, and mHSP70 or the PBS control. ELISPOT assay is a sensitive functional method for measuring IFN- production at the single-cell level. mHSP110-E711-20 complex primed potent and specific cytotoxicity. we then used an LDH release assay to investigate whether the mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited the antigen-specific CTLs from HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. the results were similar to those obtained when the E711-20-loaded T2 cells were used as the target cells. none of the cytotoxic T cells from any of the groups killed the TC-1 cells. mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited antitumor effects. immunizations also produced significant antitumor effects compared to the mHSP110 alone, mHSP70 alone, and E749-57 alone and the PBS group. data represent the mean tumor volumes of all 10 mice per group. deaths include those of mice that were euthanized upon becoming moribund due to tumor burden. an FITC signal was detected at the position corresponding to the mHSP110 or mHSP70 protein in the gel. however, when the complex was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, no fluorescent signal was observed at the position corresponding to the mHSP110 band. this indicated noncovalent binding of mHSP110 with the peptide E711-20. mHSP70-E711-20 complex and the CFA-emulsified E711-20 peptide primed similar lymphocyte proliferation levels. spleen cells from mice immunized with mHSP110, mHSP70, and mHSP70 did not stimulate significant cell proliferation after in vitro restimulation. mHSP70-E711-20 complex and the CFA-emulsified E711-20 peptide stimulated much higher IFN- production than the immunogens E711-20, mHSP110, and mHSP70 or the PBS control. ELISPOT assay is a sensitive functional method for measuring IFN- production at the single-cell level. mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited antigen-specific CTLs from immunized mice. T2 cells pulsed with the E711-20 peptide were used as the target cells. the cytolytic activity of effector T cells on the T2 cells pulsed with the peptide was significantly higher than in other groups when the E/T ratio was 50:1. mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited antitumor effects in vivo. mHSP70-E711-20 and CFA-emulsified E711-20 immunizations inhibited tumor growth. mHSP70-E711-20 and CFA-emulsified E711-20 immunizations also produced significant antitumor effects compared to the mHSP110 alone, mHSP70 alone data represent the mean tumor volumes of all 10 mice per group. time to death over a 70-day period is plotted as a survival curve. deaths include those of mice that were euthanized upon becoming moribund due to tumor burden. mHSP110-E711-20 complex immunization produced very strong cytolytic effects on target T2 cells pulsed with the peptide. mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicits epitope-specific splenocyte proliferation and E711-20-specific IFN- secretion. mHSP110-E711-20 complex immunization produced very strong cytolytic effects on target T2 cells pulsed with the peptide. the mHSP110-E711-20 complex showed higher antitumor effects than CFA-emulsified E711-20 peptide. this observation is in accordance with previous findings by Wang et al."}
