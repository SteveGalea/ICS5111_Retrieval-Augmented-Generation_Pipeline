{"summary": "myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery and heart infarction. hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) initiates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing massive ROS production and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) initiates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing massive ROS production. myricitrin is able to protect endothelia cells against ROS-induced apoptosis and prevent plaque formation at an early stage in an atherosclerotic mouse model. we also reported that myricitrin inhibits high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy. there are few reports on the effects and mechanisms of myricitrin on cardiomyocyte apoptosis following I/R injury. primary antibodies against Hsp90, Akt, and p-Akt were purchased from abcam. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from CW Biotech (Beijing, China) the inhibitor-treated groups were processed the same as the H/R+Myr group. the cells were pre-incubated with 2 M 17-AAG for 1 h, then removed the medium and treated with myricitrin. the appropriate concentration of the selective HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, was determined on the basis of data found in the literature (Wu et al., 2012) the cells were pre-incubated with 40 M myricitrin (40 M) for 12 h. the cells were exposed to 6 h of hypoxia followed by 12 h reoxygenation. after treatment, the cells were harvested, placed into 5-mL round-bottom polystyrene tubes. cellular fluorescence was measured using an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit. cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS and incubated with 5 L of FITC-Annexin V. Western blot analysis After treatment, H9c2 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with cell lysis buffer containing 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. molecular targets of myricitrin were predicted using Discovery Studio (DS) 4.5. the results are the result of at least three independent experiments. a higher fit value represents a better fit. a higher fit value represents a better fit. the cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v), and 2 mM L-glutamine. the cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 100% relative humidity in a CO2 incubator containing 5% CO2. for all experiments, the cells were plated at an appropriate density according to the experimental design. cell viability analysis Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. cells were plated onto 96-well plates at a density of 1 104 cells/well. after designated treatment, 20 L of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to each well. cells were re-suspended in 500 L of ROS detection solution. cells were stained in the dark at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cells labeled with JC-1 were analyzed using flow cytometry. the cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. they were then incubated with 5 L of FITC-Annexin V and 1 L of the PI working solution (100 g/mL) in 100 L of cell suspension for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. the fluorescence intensity was detected using microplate reader with excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. the immunoblots were developed using an electrochemiluminescence kit. Statistical significance was set at p 0.05. all data are the result of at least three independent experiments. survival rate increased from 65.48 6.42% (with H/R treatment alone) to 78.92 5.41%. myricitrin Enhanced Anti-oxidant Enzyme Activity in H/R-Treated H9c2 Cells Oxidant stress has long been associated with heart injury in response to I/R. oxidation is one of the primary events in oxidative damage, which can be assessed according to the degradation product MDA. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 8 per group). p 0.05 versus control, ##p 0.01 versus control; p 0.01 versus H/R-treated cells, p 0.01 versus H/R-treated cells. pretreatment with myricitrin significantly decreased the ratio of apoptotic cells to 3.89 0.62%. apoptotic cells stained with FITC-Annexin V-PI measured using flow cytometry; Statistical analysis of flow cytometry data. proteins related to apoptotic signaling were analyzed using Western blotting. proteins related to apoptotic signaling were analyzed using Western blotting. protein expression and activity were examined as the protein loading control. human surfactant protein D 0.781527 3 1uk4-08 SARS Coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) 0.760173 4 3cyq-01 C-terminal domain of Helicobacter pylori MotB (residues 125\u2013256) 0.737434 5 2orj-03 Human surfactant protein D 0.72869 6 1a4h-09 ATP/ADP-binding site in the Hsp90 0.720799 Western blot analysis of the Hsp90/-actin expression was performed. -actin expression was examined as the protein loading control. Western blotting was performed for each group targeting the ratio of p-Akt to Akt. effects of myricitrin and 17-AAG on mitochondrial transmembrane permeability transition based on JC-1 staining. 78.92 5.41%, 83.56 5.89%, and 87.48 7.68% after treatment with 10, 20, and 40 M myricitrin. myricitrin pretreatment decreased the LDH levels in the culture medium. this effect is consistent with its protective effects on cell viability. myricitrin pretreatment significantly enhanced the activities of the endogenous antioxidative enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px compared to the H/R group. the activity of the endogenous antioxidative enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px were detected. myricitrin decreased H/R-Induced Apoptosis in H9c2 Cells Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (m), an early marker of apoptosis. apoptosis is associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (m), an early marker of apoptosis. p 0.05 versus control, ##p 0.01 versus control, p 0.01 versus H/R-treated cells. caspase-9 activity and active caspase-3 levels markedly increased after treatment. the data are presented as the means SD from three independent experiments. #p 0.05 versus control, ##p 0.01 versus control; p 0.01 versus H/R-treated cells, p 0.01 versus H/R-treated cells. top 10 disease-related targets are shown in Table 1. 87 8 1uk4-09 SARS Coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) 0.676778 9 1amw-05 ATP/ADP-binding site in the Hsp90 0.637425 10 1a4h-07 ATP/ADP-binding site in the Hsp90 0.637425 10 1a4h-07 ATP/ADP-binding site in the Hsp90 0.616956 Hsp90 Contributes to the Cytoprotecti the data are presented as the means SD from three independent experiments. #p 0.05 versus control, ##p 0.01 versus control; p 0.05 versus H/R-treated cells. to determine whether such elevated expression of Hsp90 is responsible for the cell protective effect of myricitrin. myricitrin and 17-AAG on mitochondrial ROS levels via MitoSox Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator staining. data are expressed as the means SD from three independent experiments. cardiomyocyte apoptosis is also one of the major contributors to the development of myocardial I/R injury. hypoxia and excess ROS alter the mitochondrial structure and trigger mitochondrial depolarization as well as dissipation of m. ricitrin potently inhibits calcium transport, likely through the interaction of the phenolic groups of this flavonoid with the Ca2+ transporting protein. in the present study, we investigated potential targets that may have significant relationships with the pharmacologic effects of myricitrin. Hsp90 acts as an upstream regulator of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt survival pathway during cellular stress. we previously showed that myricitrin mediates cardiovascular protection through activation of the Akt signaling pathway. inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG significantly abolished myricitrin-induced cardioprotection against H/R injury. myricitrin may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury. authors say the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
