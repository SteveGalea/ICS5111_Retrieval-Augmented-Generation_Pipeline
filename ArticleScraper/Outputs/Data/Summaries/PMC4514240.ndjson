{"summary": "the live attenuated measles virus vaccine is one of few vaccines having an extensive safety and efficacy record. the vaccine can be injected subcutaneously and/or dispensed as an aerosol. the design, engineering and production of rMV (rMV) from clinically approved vaccine strains is now achieved using reverse genetic technology. human SLAM has been described to function as receptor for most wild-type MV strains. human SLAM has been described to function as receptor for most wild-type MV strains. hCD46tg mice were generated independently in 1996 by two different groups. the level of susceptibility is dependent on the expression of hCD46 at the surface of each cell. hCD46tg-B29 displayed the highest hCD46 expression with a median fluorescence intensity (fi) of 109. black/6 wt mice did not express the hCD46 receptor, corroborating previous reports. homozygous hCD46tg-B and hCD46tg-C mice showed reduced breeding capacity. a 105 pfu/dose was necessary to induce relevant immune responses in hCD46tg-A and to a less extent in black/6 wt mice. black/6, hCD46tg-A, and IFNARCD46tg mice were immunized i.m with 103, 104, or 105 pfu rMVb. ELISA positivity is defined as 3 over negative control sera. after a single immunization of 105 pfu/dose/animal, no significant difference was observed between MV-IgG titers of black/6 wt and hCD46 hCD46tg-A and IFNARCD46tg mice developed comparable anti-MV-IgG titers, which ranged from 1:1000 to 1:100 000. black/6 mice developed only minimal anti-MV-IgG and undetectable HIVenv humoral responses. rMV did not replicate well in black/6 mice. black/6 and hCD46tg-A mice were immunized i.m with 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag or 105 pfu UV inactivated rMV-SIVgag (UV-rMV-SIVgag) cellular immune response was assessed by IFN ELISpot 2 wk post immunization. IFNARCD46tg mice induced the highest cellular immune response. hCD46tg-A and black/6 wt mice showed lower frequencies of IFN-secreting CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. five black/6, hCD46tg-A, and IFNARCD46tg mice were immunized with 105 pfu rMVb2-SIVgag. Splenocytes were isolated 2 wk post immunization and restimulated in vitro with either MV-N or SIVgag peptide pools. negative controls, cultured with media alone, showed less than 0.04% double positive cells in the upper right quadrant when cells reactive to MV-N and CD8+ T-cells reactive to SIVgag. 79% of all MV-N specific CD4+ T-cells in black/6 mice. hCD46tg-A mice co-expressed IFN, IL-2, and TNF. hCD46tg-B29 showed the highest hCD46 expression with a median fluorescence intensity (fi) of 109, followed by hCD46tg-A28,32 mice PBMCs with a median of 89 fi. hCD46 expression is remarkably homogeneous within each mouse strain. mouse strain hCD46tg-A was bred from a heterozygous hCD46tg-A male crossed with a wt black/6 female, which resulted in high breeding capacity. homozygous hCD46tg-B and hCD46tg-C mice showed reduced breeding capacity and were prone to obesity. black/6, hCD46tg-A, and IFNARCD46tg mice were immunized i.m with 103, 104, or 105 pfu rMVb. anti-measles N humoral immune response was determined by ELISA 4 wk post immunization. after a single immunization of 105 pfu/dose/animal, no significant difference was observed between MV-IgG t hCD46tg-A and IFNARCD46tg mice developed comparable anti-MV-IgG titers, which ranged from 1:1000 to 1:100 000. black/6 mice developed only minimal anti-MV-IgG and undetectable HIVenv humoral responses. rMV did not replicate well in black/6 mice. 1310 spot forming cells (SFC), followed by hCD46tg-A (271 SFC) and black/6 (156 SFC) difference observed in numbers of IFN-secreting cell between black/6 and hCD46tg-A mice was significant (P = 0.003**) IFNARCD46tg mice induced the highest cellular immune response. hCD46tg-A and black/6 wt mice showed lower frequencies of IFN-secreting T-cells. five black/6, hCD46tg-A, and IFNARCD46tg mice were immunized with 105 pfu rMVb2-SIVgag. Splenocytes were isolated 2 wk post immunization and restimulated in vitro. negative controls, cultured with media alone, showed less than 0.04% double positive cells in the upper right quadrant when stained against IFN and CD4+ or CD8+. cytokine distribution of CD4+ T-cells reactive to MV-N and CD8+ T-cells reactive to SIVgag. 79% of all MV-N specific CD4+ T-cells in black/6 mice. hCD46tg-A mice showed comparable cytokine patterns. IFNARCD46tg mice showed a different cytokine pattern with significantly less specific T-cells secreting IL-2. preclinical development of rMV includes the characterization of immune response in mice and/or primates. primate studies are logistically challenging and expensive. the optimal immunization dose for black/6 and hCD46tg-A was 105 pfu. but when assessed after a boost, measles IgG titer were significantly higher in hCD46tg mice compared with black/6 wt mice. intracellular cytokine FACS analysis showed superiority of hCD46tg mice compared with black/6 mice induction of anti-measles and anti-SIVgag specific cellular immune response. the cellular immune response measured in IFNARCD46tg mice remained the strongest among the three mouse strains. hCD46tg-A mice developed cellular as well as humoral immune response against the MV vector and the transgene. this mouse model can be recommended for investigating immune responses against rMVsvaccines. hCD46tg-A mice were bred from heterozygous hCD46tg-A male crossed with black/6 wild-type females. transgene expression was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence. samples were acquired on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) whole blood was isolated from individual mice and added to 200 l PBS 10 mM EDTA to prevent coagulation. cells were fixed and erythrocytes lysed using a one-step approach. one 106 splenocytes per 96 well were restimulated with peptide pools. peptide pools were used to restimulate splenocytes for NIH AIDS. 15-mers spanning the whole measles-N protein and overlapping by 10 aa were used at a final concentration 100 nM per peptide. ELISA assays Anti-MV antibody titers were determined according to standard protocols. value three times above the mean of negative sera was set as cut-off. 293\u20133-46 helper T-cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate protocol (Invitrogen) with full-length p(+)MV, and pEMC-La helper plasmid. single syncytia representing individual clones of rMV were picked and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) at the age of 6-12 wk with standard measles vaccine or recombinant measles virus (rMVb-HIVenv clade B) or rMV expressing the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) gag protein (rMVb-SIVgag) spleens were meshed through a 70 m cell strainer (BD Falcon) two weeks post immunisation, spleens were meshed through a 70 m strainer. spleens were rinsed with PBS containing 2% FCS. Splenocytes were then washed twice in FACS buffer and fixed in BD cell fix (BD PharMingen) FACS analysis was performed within 24 h. Peptides covering the SIVgag and HIVenv regions were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent and Reference Reagent Program. ELISPOT development was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. duplicates of 0.5 Mio or 0.2 Mio splenocytes per well were restimulated for 17\u201318 h."}
