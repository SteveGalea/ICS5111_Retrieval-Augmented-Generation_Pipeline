{"summary": "angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) contains a single HEMGH zinc-dependent catalytic site. it degrades the vasoconstrictor angiotensin (Ang) II to the vasodilator Ang-(1-7). ACE2 gene knockout mice develop accelerated Ang II-mediated glomerulosclerosis [5] and are more susceptible to kidney injury in the type 1 diabetes. ectodomain shedding of soluble forms of ACE2 has been reported to occur in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and airway epithelial cells. ectodomain shedding of soluble forms of ACE2 has been reported to occur in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and airway epithelial cells mediated by the enzyme tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- convertase (ADAM17) ACE2 fragments shed from PT cells have not been characterized with regards to possible cleavage sites within ACE2. the aim of this study was to first determine if ACE2 is shed from primary cultures of mouse PT cells. the effect of high D-glucose or Ang II on ACE2 ectodomain shedding was examined. the pellet was gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after collagenase digestion, the cortical suspension was strained through a 250 m brass sieve and centrifuged at 1500 g for 1 min. the final pellet was suspended in culture medium and centrifuged to remove the Percoll solution. cells were incubated for 24\u201372 hrs with varying concentrations of Ang II (1010\u2013107 M), Ang II (1010\u2013107 M), high levels of D-glucose (25 mM), or L-glucose (25 mM) after 24 h, cells were attached to the culture dishes, and switched to a defined serum-free medium, with glucose concentration 7.8 mM. after 5 days, cells reached 70% confluence and had a typical epi PT cells derived from wild-type mice were transfected with a human ACE2 expression vector (HA-hACE2) one day prior to transfection, subconfluent PT cells (50\u201370%) were placed in defined medium without antibiotics. ACE2 activity or protein expression in cell lysates and culture medium was assayed. ACE2 activity in cell culture media was measured using a commercially available synthetic fluorogenic substrate for ACE2 (Mca-Ala-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-OH) for all experiments, media was first centrifuged at 9300 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to remove dead cells and cellular debris. the linear range of detection for mouse recombinant ACE2 was between 1.56\u201350 ng/ml (R2 = 0.9976, p0.001) further experiments determined that using this assay, ACE2 activity in media samples was linear for at least 24 hrs of incubation with the fluorogenic substrate.

Expect value: 0.0002 (see Table S3 for details) lower concentrations of Ang II (1010\u2013108 M) had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in the cell media. the stimulatory effect of Ang II on ACE2 activity in the culture media was blocked by co-incubation with losartan (105 M) increased ACE2 activity in the media, with a near doubling at 72 hrs. incubation of cells in L-glucose (25 mM) had no effect on ACE2 activity in the media. addition of D-glucose (25 mM) to media without cell incubation had no effect on ACE2 activity. TAPI-1 (105 M) also partly inhibited the small but significant increase in ACE2 activity in the media induced by Ang II (107 M) mouse PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs in high D-glucose (D\u2013G, 25 mM) media. mouse PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs with Ang II (105 M) in the presence or absence of TAPI-1 (105 M) mice were incubated for 72 hrs in high D-glucose (D-G, 25 mM) media. mouse PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs in normal media (C, 7.8 mM D-glucose) or in high D-glucose (D-G, 25 mM) media. immunoblots were performed on media from mouse PT cells.

Discussion The present studies are first to demonstrate shedding of active fragments of ACE2 from kidney PT cells. high glucose, and to a lesser extent Ang II, stimulate ACE2 release from PT cells. inhibition of ADAM17 blocked glucose-stimulated shedding of ACE2 and partly inhibited Ang II-induced shedding. ACE2 is an 805-amino acid type I transmembrane glycoprotein. ACE2 is constitutively shed from mouse PT cells derived from ACE2 KO mice. ACE2 is a transmembrane metalloproteinase, which acts as a \u201csheddase\u201d and cleaves cell surface proteins, including tumour necrosis factor-, the type II interleukin-1 receptor, and transforming growth factor-. in ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells, basal shedding of ACE2 was not significantly affected by either TAPI-1 or GM6001. TAPI-1 completely blocked high glucose-stimulated shedding of ACE2 from PT cells, and caused a partial inhibition of Ang II-stimulated ACE2 shedding from PT cells. we did not determine the differential enzymatic activity of the fragments. the presence of the ACE2 ectodomain in each sequence predicts retention of ACE2 activity. ACE2 fragments of human ACE2 at 80 kDa and 70 kDa each retained equivalent ACE2 activity. Arg705 was identified as the C-terminal amino acid for the shorter 60 kDa deglycosylated ACE2 fragment in both unstimulated and stimulated PT cells. a putative cleavage site for ADAM17-mediated shedding was identified at the bond Arg708-Ser709 in human ACE2. a mutation of Leu584 in human ACE2 to Ala584 prevents shedding. this suggests this represents a sheddase \u201crecognition motif\u201d. the significance of this finding is uncertain, although this peptide could represent an additional fragment of ACE2 constitutively shed. the effect of Ang II on ACE2 shedding was relatively minor. increases in luminal ACE2 activity occur in the diabetic kidney. ectodomain shedding of ACE has been shown to occur in polarized renal epithelial cells. primary cultures of mouse PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs with Ang II (1010\u2013107 M) PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs with Ang II (1010\u2013107 M) p0.05 vs C, n = 4\u201310."}
