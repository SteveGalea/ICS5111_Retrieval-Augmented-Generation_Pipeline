{"summary": "study describes isolation and identification of a natural reassortant MRV from least horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus pusillu) in china, referred to as RpMRV-YN2012. results showed that RpMRV-YN2012 contained 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. MRVs have four major serotypes (type 1 Lang, type 2 Jones, type 3 Dearing, and type 4 Ndelle) each MRV particle contains 10 genome segments divided into three size classes based upon their characteristic mobility during gel electrophoresis. the virions have an average diameter of 70\u201380 nm with a typical icosahedral, double-layered protein capsid structure. the first isolation of a novel natural reassortant MRV strain from the least horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus pusillus) in china. the whole genome sequence of RpMRV-YN2012 was determined by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. supernatant was filtered through 0.45-m filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. two aliquots of 200 l diluted supernatant were added to monolayer BHK-21 and Tb1Lu cells in a 24-well plate separately. the flasks were observed daily for toxicity, contamination, or viral cytopathic effect (CPE) a drop of culture supernatant was adsorbed on Formvar carbon coated grid (1 min), stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.3) (1 min) and inactivated with ultraviolet irradiation before examination. cells were fixed 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4\u00b0C to make ultrathin sections. migration of genome segments Virion from culture supernatant was harvested. position L1_F1 Sense GCTACACGTTCCACGACAATGTCATC 1\u201326 L1_R1 Antisense GTGCCGATCTAGCATCATCATCATCATCATC 966\u2013991 L1_F2 Antisense CTAGCGATCATCATCATCATGTGGAC 966\u2013991 L1_F2 Antisense CTAGCGATCATCATCATCATGTGGAC 1830\u20131853 L1_F3 Antisense CCTAGTCATCATCAT 3913 L3_F1 Sense GCTAATCGTCAGGATGAAGCGGATT 1\u201325 L3_R1 Antisense GCCATGATGACGGATGAATCTC 966\u2013987 L3_F2 Sense ACCGTTTCCAGAGGCGGCAGTGTCT 895\u2013919 L3_R2 Antisense AGGCGTTGAGAAAGCACTCG 1972\u20131997 L3_F3 Antisense CGTCCATTGTACTGTTG an ORF search was performed with the ORF Finder of the NCBI. nucleotide (nt) sequences and deduced amino acid (aa) products were analyzed and assembled using the DNASTAR program. prevalence study The throat and anal swabs were thawed at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 16,000xg for 5 min to pellet debris. supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. extracted RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA with random hexamers. supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m filter (Millipore) to remove bacterium-sized particles. two aliquots of 200 l diluted supernatant were added to monolayer BHK-21 and Tb1Lu cells in a 24-well plate separately. cells were homogenized by three freeze-thaw cycles. 80% BHK-21 cells showed CPE, the supernatant of the medium was concentrated at 40,000 rpm for 25 min in a Hitachi centrifuge (Hitachi, Japan) for negative staining, one drop of culture supernatant was adsorbed on Formvar carbon coated grid (1 min), stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.3) (1 min), and inactivated with ultraviolet irradiation before examination. the genome sequences of all segments were reconfirmed by overlapping PCRs with specific primers (Table 1). the genome sequences of all segments were reconfirmed by overlapping nested PCRs with specific primers (Table 1).

BLAST searches were carried out using the NCBI server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL_X, version 2.0. maximum-likelihood trees of L, M and S segments were also generated in MEGA. one isolate was obtained from a pool urine sample of Rhinolophus pusillus. the isolate caused cytopathogenic effects 3\u20134 days post-inoculation in both cell lines. these CPE included granulating, shrinking, rounding, seining, and falling off. whole genome sequences of 10 segments (L1\u2013L3, M1\u2013M3, S1\u2013S4) of RpMRV-YN2012 were determined. the genome sequences of all segments were reconfirmed by overlapping nested PCRs with specific primers. the results showed that six segments (L1\u2013L3, M2, M3, S1) of RpMRV-YN2012 were closely related to those of human reoviruses (SI-MRV01 and tou05), which isolated from patients with acute gastroenteritis and acute necrotizing encephal. pig strains have higher sequence identity (94.9\u201396.2%/96.8\u201397.5%, nt/aa identity) nt and aa sequences of M1 between RpMRV-YN2012 and the pig strains ranged from 93.9 to 96.2% and from 96.8 to 97.9%, respectively. 87.9/98.5 NA 94.4/99.3 94.6/99.4 84.6/98.5 84.2/98.1 84.6/97.9 87.5/98.2 M1 94.5/97.4 70.3/79.7 93.9/97.6 NA 86.0/95.3 86.3/95.7 88.7/96.6 94.5/98.3 94.3/97.1 94.6/97.9 M2 80.7/97.3 78.5/96.3 83.8 the topology of the phylogenetic trees confirmed the relationship of RpMRV-YN2012 with these bat, pig, and human MRV strains. the reconstructed tree sorted RpMRV-YN2012 to pig- or bat-associated serotype 3 MRVs. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the sequence of RpMRV-YN2012 from this study is in bold italic typeface. the isolate caused cytopathogenic effects (CPE) 3\u20134 days post-inoculation in both cell lines. these CPE included granulating, shrinking, rounding, seining, and falling off. the isolate was plaque-purified and visualized by negative-staining electron microscopy. entire genome sequences of 10 segments (L1\u2013L3, M1\u2013M3, S1\u2013S4) of RpMRV-YN2012 were determined. the genome sequences of all segments were reconfirmed by overlapping nested PCRs with specific primers. the complete genome of RpMRV-YN2012 was 23,578 nt in length. the results showed that six segments (L1\u2013L3, M2, M3, S1) of RpMRV-YN2012 were closely related to those of human reoviruses (SI-MRV01 and tou05), which isolated from patients with acute gastroenteritis and acute necrotizing encephalopathy recently in Slovenia and France. nt and aa sequences of M1 between RpMRV-YN2012 and the pig strains ranged from 93.9 to 96.2% and from 96.8 to 97.9%, respectively. the three other segments (S2-S4) shared high sequence similarity with bat-originated MRV strain 342/08. 94.6/99.4 84.6/98.5 84.2/98.1 84.6/97.9 87.5/98.2 M1 94.5/97.4 70.3/79.7 93.9/97.6 NA 86.0/95.3 86.3/95.7 88.7/96.6 94.5/98.3 94.3/97.1 94.6/97.9 M2 80.7/97.3 78.5/96.3 83.8/62.4 82.7/97.3 86.9/97. the topology of the phylogenetic trees confirmed the relationship of RpMRV-YN2012 with these bat, pig, and human MRV strains. the reconstructed tree sorted RpMRV-YN2012 to pig- or bat-associated serotype 3 MRVs. phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Maximum-likelihood method. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the sequence of RpMRV-YN2012 from this study is in bold italic typeface. in 2007, a novel bat-origin orthoreovirus, Melaka virus (MelV), was isolated from a patient with acute respiratory disease in Melaka, Malaysia. in 2008, the fourth member of the NBV species group, Kampar virus (KamV), was isolated from a human patient with fever and acute respiratory illness. in 2008, the fourth member of the NBV species group, Kampar virus (KamV), was suggested to be a bat-borne orthoreovirus by epidemi the viral 1 protein is unique to each prototype of mammalian reovirus. it determines the serotype and also determines the serotype. the viral 1 protein is the major genetic determinant of neurovirulence in infected mice. s and necrotizing encephalopathy should be monitored in real time. we should monitor its evolution and virulence in real time."}
