{"summary": "eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses have a single-stranded genome of messenger RNA polarity, i.e., positive-strand RNA (1, 2). During replication, the genomic RNA serves as a template in the synthesis of a minus strand, which then serves to produce more plus-strand RNAs (3). the alphavirus genome encodes two polyproteins. the nonstructural polyprotein P1234 is first cleaved to P123 and nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4). nsP4 is the core RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) nsP4 is the core RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) but RNA synthesis also requires nsP1. CPVs revealed the role of spherules in viral RNA replication. spherules are first formed at the plasma membrane. in SFV-infected cells, spherules are internalized. in contrast, Sindbis virus (SINV) and CHIKV spherules predominantly stay on the plasma membrane. alphavirus RCs have been purified in sucrose and glycerol density gradients. purification often yields poor replication activity. there is no structure available for the alphavirus RCs or RdRp. synthesis was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of [32P]CTP into viral RNA. incorporation was readily detected after a 5-min reaction time. a 1-h reaction time was routinely used unless otherwise stated. SFV PNS could be diluted at least 100-fold without replication activity. the last two lanes show samples containing 1 mg/ml BSA or 100 M 3\u2032-dCTP. total RNA was isolated after the same preincubations as those described for panel D. in-gel hybridization revealed that the endogenous minus-strand RNA was also stable. minus-strand RNA resides inside the spherules as part of double-stranded RNA molecules. we also determined the stability of RCs in the density gradient medium iodixanol. spherules were destroyed and the minus-strand RNA was exposed to cellular nucleases. wortmannin blocks SFV spherules mainly on the plasma membrane. nocodazole treatment leads to their accumulation in small endocytic vesicles. PNS was prepared from untreated and drug-treated cells infected at an MOI of 500. 100 nM wortmannin at 1.5 h p.i. or 5 M nocodazole at 0 h p.i., or left untreated. wortmannin was treated with wortmannin at 1.5 h p.i. and harvested in an isotonic homogenization buffer at 4 h p.i. SFV-infected cells lysed better than mock-infected cells. most of the proteins and about half of the lipids present in PNS from mock- and SFV-infected cells distributed to S7. GM130 was exclusively detected in S7, and -actin was more prominent in S7 than in P7. in both mock- and virus-infected samples the late endosomal marker Rab7 was more prominent in S7 than in P7. the enrichment was stronger in the mock samples. RNA in PNS, S7, and P7 prepared from SFV-infected cells. numbers below the lanes indicate the amount of 42S RNA as a percentage of that in PNS. minus- and plus-strand RNA distributed equally to S7 and P7. the protein pattern in each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE. most proteins stayed in the top fractions of sedimentation gradients. in both gradients, lipids concentrated in fr. 5 and 6 (band 3) osomes and lysosomes, and CLIMP-63 and RTN4B as additional markers for the endoplasmic reticulum (sheets and tubules, respectively) the sample volumes loaded from the fractions in the coomassie- or Sudan-stained gels (A and B) were about five and seven times larger, respectively, than the sample volume loaded from the original S7. nsPs concentrated in fr. 1, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, corresponding to bands 1, 2, and 3, respectively. a minor amount was detected in fr. 5 and 6 (band 3) in the mock gradient, the plasma membrane marker PMCA mostly stayed on the top. in vitro replication assay showed that most SFV replication activity was in fr. 5 and 6 (band 3) of the sedimentation gradient. this band, at a density of 1.10 to 1.11 g/ml, was collected for further purification. the upper band in the flotation gradient was considerably weaker than the other band. western blotting detected only a weak calnexin signal in fr. 3 and 4. plasma membrane marker PMCA, late endosome marker Rab7, and ER marker calnexin also concentrated in fr. 4. nsP2 and capsid protein in these fractions did not float. in vitro replication activity of the same fractions as those used for panel A. in panel A the volume from the fractions used for RNA isolation was about 7.5 times larger than the sample volume. in panels B and C 20-fold-diluted S7 was used. purified RCs synthesized both genomic and subgenomic RNA. RNA II was observed only in sedimentation fr. 1 and 3. membrane sheets with multiple, spherical invaginated membranes were typical of the purified RCs. in vitro replication reactions were terminated by adding the nucleoside analogue 3\u2032-dCTP followed by a chase for 3 h. in the unterminated control samples, the amount of the [32P]CTP-labeled genomic RNA increased approximately 1.7-fold or 2.5-fold in the reaction mixtures containing S7 or purified RCs. RCs + Tmed RNA shows incorporation by the purified RCs after an exogenous Tmed RNA transcript was added. RCs + Tmed RNA shows incorporation by the purified RCs after an exogenous Tmed RNA transcript was added. RCs were treated with 1% Tx-100, followed by an assay to detect replication. a replication assay was performed with the concentrated purified RCs. after 60-, 120-, and 180-min replication reactions, aliquots were removed to prepare pellet and supernatant fractions. aliquots were removed to prepare pellet and supernatant fractions, followed by RNA isolation and analysis in a denaturing agarose gel. synthesized when the Tmed template was provided in addition to the endogenous one. once a functional RC has been formed it is unable to replicate another template. after 1% Tx-100 treatment, the minus-strand template remained stable. the detergent sensitivity was not due to exposure to nucleases. d RNA or an almost full-length 32P-labeled single-stranded overhang. nondenaturing electrophoresis also supported the presence of both RF and RI. RF/RI signal was reduced approximately 32% after the A/T1 digestion. the presence of newly made RNA in RIs and release of newly made strands indicated that de novo initiation occurs in vitro. the linear rate of RNA synthesis in the unterminated RC samples indicated that the purified RCs are able to initiate new strands. this result also supports the possibility of de novo initiation during in vitro replication. SFV RCs are most active in RNA synthesis in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells at 4 to 5 h postinfection (p.i.) at a multiplicity of infection (39) postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared from SFV-infected cells (MOI of 50) at 4 h p.i. and in vitro RNA synthesis was analyzed. rRNA was detected by in-gel hybridization from the same gel. the last two lanes show samples containing 1 mg/ml BSA or 100 M 3\u2032-dCTP. the complexes remained active throughout a 48-h incubation at 4\u00b0C. in-gel hybridization revealed that the endogenous minus-strand RNA was also stable. minus-strand RNA resides inside the spherules as part of double-stranded RNA molecules. DOC and SDS caused the loss of both the minus-strand template and replication activity. 80% and 90% of the minus-strand RNA present in the untreated sample was recovered. wortmannin blocks SFV spherules mainly on the plasma membrane. nocodazole treatment leads to their accumulation in small endocytic vesicles. the amount of plus-strand RNA was doubled compared to untreated cells infected at an MOI of 500. this phenomenon was also observed with nocodazole-treated and untreated cells infected at an MOI of 500 compared to untreated cells infected at an MOI of 50. at the higher MOI, RCs are formed faster and have more time to synthesize plus strands. nuclei and any remaining intact cells were lysed for RC purification. further centrifugation to remove mitochondria at 7,000 g yielded a P7 pellet and S7 supernatant. the same amount of cells was seeded for mock and virus infection, but when cells were collected, mock samples contained twice the amount of cells as that of the infected samples. gels were stained after a short electrophoresis to allow detection of species below a 10-kDa marker. most of nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4, as well as about 50% of nsP1, was found in the viral S7. GM130, the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin, the mitochondrial marker succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) and the cytosolic marker PMCA was used as a marker for the plasma membrane, GM130 for the Golgi membrane, calnexin for the endoplasmic reticulum, SDHA for the mitochondria, and -actin for the cytosol. numbers in parentheses indicate the percentage of the protein present in the S7 fraction compared to that in PNS. RCs were first purified from the S7 fractions by sedimentation in a 10 to 20% iodixanol step gradient. a light-scattering band was detected in every interphase as well as close to the gradient surface. the protein pattern in each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE. gradients were fractionated (fr. 1 to 12, from top to bottom; fr. 13, the pellet) and compared to S7. protein (A) and lipid (B) patterns were studied in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie blue or Sudan black B. Western blotting revealed the distribution of viral and cellular markers between gradient fractions. nsPs concentrated in fr. 1, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, corresponding to bands 1, 2, and 3, respectively. the plasma membrane marker PMCA mostly stayed on the top, while in the SFV gradient it concentrated in fr. 1 as well as fr. 5 and 6 (band 3). in the mock gradient, LAMP-2 concentrated in fr. 2 to 5 and in the SFV gradient in fr. 1 to 5. the ER marker calnexin concentrated in the mock gradient in fr. 3 and 4 (band 2) and fr. 5 and 6 (band 3) and in the SFV gradient in fr. 5 and 6 (band 3) fractions 10 to 12 represent 30% iodixanol containing band 3 collected from the sedimentation gradient. upper band in the flotation gradient (Fig. 3, band 1) was considerably weaker than the other band (Fig. 3, band 2). detectable proteins and lipids concentrated in the area of the band 2 or lower fractions. K ATPase, CLIMP-63 and RTN4B concentrated in fr. 4 in the SFV gradient. these markers were undetectable in the mock fr. 3 to 5 of both SFV gradients. rRNA was detected from the same fractions (fr. 1 to 12, from top to bottom; fr. 13 is the pellet) the RCs in the flotation fr. 4 (band 2) were designated purified RCs. the average protein concentration of the purified RCs from three purifications was 0.02 mg/ml. the recovery of the activity present in S7 was approximately 20% when the [32P]CTP incorporation into the genomic RNA was compared. a few nucleocapsids were also found close to the spherule-like structures. SFV RCs were purified in subsequent sedimentation and flotation gradients. membranes with spherical invaginations of about 50 nm in diameter typical of SFV only. a capped in vitro transcript of Tmed RNA was added to the reactions. it was rapidly degraded in the S7 sample and the half-life was less than 15 min. this indicated that the newly synthesized SFV RNA was protected in the S7 sample. in the reaction mixture containing purified RCs, the Tmed RNA was approximately as stable as the viral replication products. RCs + Tmed RNA shows incorporation by the purified RCs after an exogenous Tmed RNA transcript was added. dsRNA containing a plus strand synthesized in cells (indicated by magenta) and in vitro (indicated by orange) in vitro-synthesized plus strand if replication is semiconservative. no NTPs indicates a reaction without added NTPs. ctrl indicates a sample without any incubations before RNA isolation. a denaturing gel is mainly derived from RF and double-stranded regions of RIs. the full-length 32P-labeled RNA observed in a denaturing gel is mainly derived from ssRNAs. approximately 60% of newly synthesized RNA was in RF, 20% in RI, and 20% in free ssRNAs. purified RCs were concentrated to remove iodixanol. most of the 32P-labeled RNA stayed associated with the pellet fraction. however, 32P-labeled 26S and 42S RNA were also detected in the supernatant. RNA, present in the purified RCs, as well as in vitro-synthesized, newly made RNA are detected. RNA was also isolated from a reaction mixture that contained no added NTPs. in these samples, only RNA made in cells and present in the purified RCs is detected if we assume that the purified RCs contain no significant amount of cellular NTPs. we purified spherule-carrying plasma membrane sheets using a needle instead of hypotonic buffer. we purified RCs from a postnuclear and postmitochondrial supernatant instead of a membrane pellet. we also purified RCs from a postnuclear and postmitochondrial supernatant instead of a membrane pellet. purification of the RCs resulted in a replication-active membrane fraction enriched with the markers for the plasma membrane, ER, and late endosomes. we could remove soluble proteins, the Golgi membranes, and most of the mitochondria. the membrane fraction from mock-infected cells revealed only a minor signal for the ER marker calnexin. detergent solubilization has been shown to increase the density of alphaviral RCs while they retain all nsPs and residual RNA synthesis activity (45). it remains to be studied whether the membrane association of SFV nsPs occurs only in the spherule neck or if they are also found inside the membrane invagination. authors speculate that some spherules contain more than one dsRNA or positive-strand RNA (12) most of the in vitro-synthesized RNA is single stranded (11, 40), and in vitro-synthesized RF and RI reach the maximum level in about 15 min. the release of the newly made RNA might require translation or nucleocapsid assembly. alphaviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses represent important groups of pathogenic positive-strand RNA viruses lacking structural information on RdRps (57, 58) the alphaviral core RdRp has been purified in an active form (31), but the structure of the RC might give more information about the active conformation of the polymerase and interactions. 1 107 BHK-21 cells were infected with SFV4-HA at an MOI of 500 for 1 h or 20 min, respectively, in MEM containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM l-glutamine. after the adsorption, cells were washed twice and fresh medium was added. cells were disrupted using a 22-gauge needle and syringe by 24 strokes. unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation. membrane pellet (P7) and soluble fraction (S7) were prepared by further centrifugation of the diluted PNS. anol layers were collected and purified by equilibrium flotation centrifugation (90,000 g, 18 h, 4\u00b0C) in a discontinuous iodixanol gradient consisting of 3 ml of 30% and 1.8-ml layers of 26, 22, 18, 14, and 10% (wt/vol) iodixanol in DB. a 30% layer contained the light-scattering zone collected from the sedimentation gradient. reaction mixtures were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h unless otherwise stated. aliquots were removed for total RNA isolation and in-gel hybridization. 100 M 3\u2032-dCTP and 220 ng of Tmed in vitro transcript were added to the reaction mixture after a 1-h replication assay. the ability of RCs to use an exogenous template RNA was tested by adding 1 g of Tmed in vitro transcript in a reaction mixture containing purified RCs. RNA isolated from purified RCs without incubation at 30\u00b0C. RNA isolation, denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and in-gel hybridization. total RNA from replication assay reactions, PNS, S7, and P7 samples was isolated. spike RNA (Tmed or Tshort in vitro transcript) was added to the samples before RNA isolation. Dried gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens to detect 32P label. screens were scanned with a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare) purified RCs were concentrated and iodixanol was removed by washing with DB in Amicon ultracentrifugal filter units (3,220 g, 4\u00b0C; Merck Millipore) an in vitro replication assay was performed. after 1-, 2-, and 3-h reaction times, aliquots were removed.
