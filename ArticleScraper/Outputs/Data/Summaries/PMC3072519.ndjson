{"summary": "nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (NST) may present another immunotherapeutic approach for patients with advanced stage NPC. the role of NST in patients with advanced stage NPC has not yet been evaluated. patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, active angina pectoris, uncontrolled arrhythmia, hypertension, severe chronic or restrictive lung disease, or corrected diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 50%, creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min, serum bilirubin of >2 mg/100 mL or ALT or AST >3 the upper limit of normal were excluded. phylactic CYA taper provided there was no acute GVHD and/or if the donor T-cell chimerism was not increasing. donor chimerism was analyzed weekly using semiquantitative PCR analysis. immunoophenotyping of human T lymphocytes was performed by multicolor flow cytometric analysis by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) monitoring cell-free EBV DNA was extracted from plasma samples collected at monthly intervals. for carbon monoxide of 50%, creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min, serum bilirubin of >2 mg/100 mL or ALT or AST >3 the upper limit of normal were excluded. patients with active uncontrolled infection, active central nervous system disease, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B or C positive serology received written informed consent. GVHD prophylaxis All patients received GVHD prophylaxis of CYA (Neoral; Novartis, Singapore) starting at 5 mg/kg/day i.v. divided into two doses from day 1 that was reduced to 3 mg/kg/day from day+4. 59 advanced NPC patients and their siblings were screened and HLA-typed. only 21 patients eventually received NST due to rapid progressive disease in 5 patients. all patients had extensive metastases, with a median of four (2\u20135) organ sites and 17 had previous progressive disease. seventeen patients (81%) had performance status (PS) of 0\u20131 and four (19%) had a PS of 2.

Bacterial infections (grades III, IV and V) constituted the commonest complication, occurring in seven patients. chronic GVHD (all limited) was diagnosed in six patients (30%). only one patient required prolonged CYA treatment. a lady with progressive lung, nodal, and bone metastases pre-NST achieved brief tumor shrinkage. objective PR did not occur until much later on day +662. patient 16 experienced the longest response duration (396 days) pre-NST, he was symptomatic with worsening dyspnea. median OS for patients who underwent NST was 209 (95% CI, 128\u2013236) days, the 1-year OS rate was 29% (s.e., 0.099) and the 2-year OS rate was 19% (s.e., 0.088) patients with chronic GVHD also had much better survival. median survival time of 326 (95% CI, 136\u2013782) days against 195 (95% CI, 100\u2013235) days. engraftment syndrome occurred only in 15% of patients and was mild, requiring no treatment, as compared to 67% in the Boston study18. despite early prophylactic CYA taper, GVHD incidence in our study significantly predicted for both response and OS. infections were more commonly observed in our study compared with other NST studies. this may be related to xerostomia, poor dentition, chronic sinusitis and altered mucosal barriers. future NST studies should consider such local immunosuppressive features."}
