{"summary": "the current serological assays offered at veterinary diagnostic laboratories for detection of PEDV-specific antibody are based on the U.S. PEDV prototype strain. three groups of PEDV-negative, 3-week-old pigs (five pigs per group) were inoculated orally with a U.S. PEDV prototype isolate. antibodies against the two PEDV strains could be detected by all three ELISAs. the current serological assays based on U.S. PEDV prototype strain can detect antibodies against both."}
