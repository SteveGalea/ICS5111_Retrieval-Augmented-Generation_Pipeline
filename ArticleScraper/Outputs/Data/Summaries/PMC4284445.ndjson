{"summary": "humanised monoclonal antibodies are now the fastest growing group of biotechnology-derived molecules in clinical trials. the global value of the antibody market is approximately $20 billion per year [2] about 30 monoclonal antibodies currently approved by the FDA for use in humans. myeloma cells lack HGPRT, they cannot synthesise nucleotides de novo as this is inhibited by aminopterin in the selective medium. the initial culture of hybridomas contains a mixture of antibodies derived from many different primary B-lymphocyte clones. each individual clone can be separated by dilution into different culture wells. clonal antibodies have been tested, each with different effects. for example, the synthesis of a relatively larger, full-sized antibody may be a step too far for such a relatively small microorganism. the lack of glycosylating enzymes in E. coli may prove beneficial for antibodies whose primary role is to block protein\u2013protein interactions. E. coli can then secrete the bacteriophage containing the VH and VL segments as part of the bacteriophage coat. specific VH and VL segments against the antigen can then be selected and used to reinoculate the bacteriophage. cells containing the plasmid can then be isolated and sequenced. Yamane-Ohnuki and Satoh discuss the development of defucosylated antibodies which have increased affinities for the FcRIIIa receptor and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. the bioavailability of IgG in plasma is partially dependent on its interaction with the neonatal Fc/Brambell receptor (FcRn). bispecific antibodies can target 2 separate epitopes with each arm of the Fab portion. they can be produced by chemical cross-linking of IgG, Fab or scFv fragments. in leukaemia treatment, it costs approximately \u00a337,000 for a year's supply of alemtuzumab [30] monoclonal antibodies present an attractive option for the development of new therapies and molecular drug targets against a wide variety of common diseases due to their specificity and flexibility. despite its drawbacks, there is still major interest from pharmaceutical companies to develop monoclonal antibodies for both clinical and diagnostic use."}
