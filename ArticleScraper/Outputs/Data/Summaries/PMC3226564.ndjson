{"summary": "non-apoptotic roles for both initiator and executioner caspases have been identified that mediate cell differentiation, maturation and signaling events. reagents are useful to investigate caspases that constitute the majority of caspase-like activity in a sample, as it may be assumed for active caspase-3 in highly apoptotic extracts. substrates for caspase-6 show a particularly high variability in their recognition sequences. domains far away from the cleavage site can mediate the interaction between substrate and protease (exosites) the presence of activated caspase-6 and cleavage of caspase-6 substrates is a hallmark of AD, HD and cerebral ischemia. the peptide substrate commonly used to assess caspase-6 activity, VEID, can be cleaved by other caspases and the proteasome when used at too high concentrations. even low concentrations of a VEID substrate can lead to inaccurate results if the relative amount of other proteolytic activity in the sample is significantly higher than that of caspase-6 due to small differences in kcat/Km. the nuclear lamin proteins were among the first caspase-6 substrates characterized [25], and knockdown studies strongly suggest their cleavage during apoptosis is highly dependent on the presence of caspase-6 [24]. a variety of neo-epitope antibodies against the cleavage fragments are readily available, and high stability of the cleavage fragments without further degradation during the apoptotic process has been described [26]. is best processed by caspase-6, still shows significant cleavage by caspase-3 and -7 at high substrate concentrations (100 M) lower substrate concentrations can be used to achieve greater specificity, however, the difference in kcat/Km for VEID is less than 3 fold between caspase -3 and -6. 5 M VEID-Afc was incubated with 0.5 M caspase-6 or different amounts of caspase-3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. an 8 fold higher molar concentration of caspase-3 than caspase-6 results in a higher signal for VEID cleavage by caspase-3 than caspase-6. the antibody used to detect full length lamin A at 70 kDa cross-reacts with the closely related lamin C protein (60 kDa, [28]) and the N-terminal fragments of both cleaved lamin A and C are detected at the same size of 28 kDa. VEID, but not lamin A+C, is cleaved in the absence of caspase-6. the cleavage of endogenous lamin A and C proteins was monitored by Western blotting. the cleavage of endogenous lamin A and C proteins was monitored by western blotting. the lamin protein substrates are much more specific for cleavage by caspase-6 than the VEID peptide. we incubated different concentrations in parallel either with Ac-VEID-AFC or purified lamin A protein and determined the amount of cleavage after 30 min. both assays perform at least equally well in detecting active caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM. a peptide inhibitor for caspase-6, VEID-CHO, both assays arrived at a similar IC50 value. ELISA method is suitable to assess the inhibition of caspase-6 by small molecules or peptides. increased sensitivity and highly improved specificity in a lamin-based caspase-6 activity assay. we found a linear increase in signal over time in wt samples. the signal from C6ko samples remained stable at background levels. this indicates the amount of intracellularly cleaved, endogenous lamin A protein is a highly specific readout for quantification of caspase-6 activated during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. lysates Caspase-6 is postulated to be involved in neuronal degeneration and apoptosis. previous studies have frequently used TUNEL assays as a measure of apoptosis, looked at VEIDase activity or the presence of the active caspase-6 fragment by Western blotting or immunostaining. the most specific methods to assess the effect of drug treatments on caspase-6 activity developed so far use antibodies against the active caspas lamins B1 and B2 differ from lamins A and C in their caspase cleavage site. lamins B1 and B2 differ from lamins A and C in their caspase cleavage site (VEVD versus VEID, respectively) caspase-6 activity can be localized to the nucleus, which is commonly associated with cell death and the cleavage of nuclear substrates such as lamin A. a cytoplasmic localization of active caspase-6 as it is the case in neurodegeneration does not result in immediate apoptosis [5], [21], [32]. to this end we transfected COS7 cells with full-length human caspase-6. the active caspase-6 fragment can be observed by Western blotting 9 h after transfection. spiking of lysates with lamin A protein leads to a robust detection of caspase-6 activity 9 h after transfection. we quantified the perinuclear immunofluorescence in a ring around the nucleus. only background signal was observed in C6ko MEFs even after camptothecin treatment. caspase-6 activity can be quantified by immunofluorescence. the lamin A protein is a more specific substrate than its VEID peptide. we first subjected the Ac-VEID-AFC substrate to digestion by caspases -3, -6 and -7, respectively. the amount of active enzyme used in each reaction was normalized to the concentration of active sites in the sample. lamin A protein is a more specific substrate than its VEID peptide. VEID is preferentially cleaved by caspase-6, but also cross-reacts with caspases -3 and -7 at higher concentrations. aved lamin A was detected by Western blotting with antibodies #2031 (full-length lamin A and N-terminal fragment) and #2032 (C-terminal fragment) no cleavage was observed with caspases -3 or -7, while caspase-6 generated lamin A fragments in a dose-dependent manner. endogenous lamin A protein (70 kDa) is cleaved in wt, but not C6ko MEFs. antibody cross-reacts with full-length lamin C (60 kDa) whereas both lamin A+C and C6ko MEFs contain both caspases. C6ko MEFs stressed with staurosporine for 4 h or more show the same levels of VEID proteolysis as wt cells. an increase in VEID cleavage over time was observed for both C6wt and C6ko cell lines. at later timepoints C6ko cells exhibit similar levels of VEID cleavage as C6wt. s of the enzyme in parallel either with Ac-VEID-AFC or purified lamin A protein. both assays perform at least equally well in detecting active caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM. signal-to-noise ratios were at or above 3 for the ELISA assay for as low as 10 nM caspase-6. VEID-CHO shows a similar IC50 value in both the VEID- and lamin A-based caspase-6 assays. the lamin cleavage assay is highly specific, with no signal generated from C6ko cells even after 6 h of staurosporine stress. the kcat/Km is still more than 10fold higher for lamin A. the binding between lamin A and caspase-6 is tighter, which might be mediated by domains outside the cleavage site. such binding sites could also be responsible for the observed specificity of caspase-6 for the full-length protein substrate. previous studies have frequently used TUNEL assays to measure apoptosis. neurons in early stages of development up until postnatal day 5 express lamins of the B1 and B2 subtypes. the cleavage of lamins B1 and B2 at this site is not specific for caspase-6. the cleavage of lamins B1 and B2 at this site is not specific for caspase-6, as has been shown in a caspase-6-deficient cell line. lamins B1 and B2 differ from lamins A and C in their caspase cleavage site (VEVD versus VEID), respectively. lysates from camptothecin-stressed C6wt represent the 25th percentile. whiskers represent the minimum and maximum. after 24 h of incubation, low levels of endogenous lamin A cleavage were observed with the ELISA method. activity could already be detected after 9 h and increased dramatically at later time points. spiking with lamin A allows for the detection of caspase-6 activity before endogenous lamin is cleaved. no staining for cleaved lamin protein was observed in non-stressed C6wt, non-stressed C6ko or camptothecin-stressed C6ko cells. a 2fold increase in staining intensity in camptothecin-stressed versus non-stressed wt MEFs. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and identified by the software (blue circles) the signal intensity in the cleaved lamin A channel was quantified in a ring around the nucleus. untreated C6wt, stressed and non-stressed C6ko MEFs were normalized to 100%. caspase-6 specific substrate protein lamin A was detected in C6wt and C6ko MEFs that were stressed with staurosporine to undergo apoptosis. the cleaved fragment was detected in C6wt, but not in C6ko MEFs. we developed an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA method to accurately quantify cleaved lamin using the Mesoscale platform. lamin A is more than 10fold higher than for VEID. a similar effect has been shown for proteases involved in blood coagulation [34], [35], where substrates are bound outside the active site of the protease. there has been speculation about the presence of exosites in caspases. a for Mesoscale ELISA (cat. no. 2036) and
