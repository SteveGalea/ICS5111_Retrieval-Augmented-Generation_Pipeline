{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread rapidly across the country due to contaminated livestock trailers. the aim of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in swine feces. dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 \u00b0C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. this study suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions."}
