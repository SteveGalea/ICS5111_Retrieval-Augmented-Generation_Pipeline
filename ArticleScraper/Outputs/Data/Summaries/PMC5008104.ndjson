{"summary": "PEDV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (1, 2). PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) the disease has broken out frequently in many pig-producing countries (4\u20139) several viral proteins acting as IFN-I antagonists have been identified in members of the family Coronaviridae. PEDV suppresses the IFN-I signaling pathway by inducing STAT1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Newcastle disease virus expressing green fluorescent protein (NDV-GFP) (35) was grown in 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs and was stored at 80\u00b0C (36) Virus infection, drug treatments, and transfection. monolayers of Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV strain CV777 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. at 24 h or 48 h postinoculation, cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 for the indicated times. an immunofluorescence assay (37) was performed as described previously. polyclonal antibody against ubiquitin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were carried out as described previously. ive dose assays were performed on vero E6 cells according to the method of Reed and Muench. cell monolayers (104 cells per well) were inoculated with 100 l serial dilutions of each virus stock. infected cells were harvested at 24 h postinfection, washed three times with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed with Pierce IP lysis buffer. Newcastle disease virus expressing green fluorescent protein (NDV-GFP) was grown in 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. unbound virus was removed, and cells were maintained in complete medium for various times until samples had been harvested. cDNA3.1/STAT1 expression vector (2 g/well) was transfected into vero E6 cells. at 24 h or 48 h postinoculation, cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 for the indicated times. a mouse MAb against -actin and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ubiquitin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. quantitative RT-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were carried out as described previously with a slight modification (39). the virus samples were clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 10 min prior to titration. the infected cells were harvested at 24 h postinfection, washed three times with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed with Pierce IP lysis buffer. vero E6 cells were infected either with PEDV for 24 h, to establish replication, or with an IFN-sensitive virus, NDV-GFP, as a control. the cells were then cultured further in the presence of IFN- at 1,000 IU/ml or 10,000 IU/ml for 24 h. the effect of IFN- on the virus infection was analyzed by an IFA. 6 cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of various concentrations of IFN-. supernatant samples were collected, and titers were determined. data represent means of duplicate measurements (SD) of virus titers. an IFA and a Western blot assay verified that UV-inactivated PEDV was replication defective. PEDV S protein was stained with MAb 3F12, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the levels of STAT1 protein were not reduced by UV-inactivated PEDV in cells. PEDV infection downregulates STAT1 by inhibiting STAT1 transcription. levels of STAT1 mRNA were also increased in PEDV-inoculated vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. proteasomal degradation pathway has high selectivity. proteasome generally recognizes ubiquitinated substrates. autophagy is a highly conserved process for degrading redundant cellular components. ubiquitinated proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation. detergent lysates were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 or carrier control DMSO for 1 h prior to PEDV infection. detergent lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a STAT1 antibody. phosphorylated STAT1 levels were increased at early time points (1 to 24 h postinfection) and decreased after 24 h postinfection. phosphorylated STAT1 levels were increased at early time points (1 to 24 h postinfection) these results suggested that the IFN response is activated at an early stage of virus infection. phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 are degraded by PEDV. both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 are degraded by PEDV. p-STAT1 levels in response to IFN- were significantly lower in PEDV-infected cells than in uninfected cells. p-STAT1 levels in response to IFN- were slightly reduced in vero E6 cells at early time points. PEDV inhibits the type I interferon pathway. vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were either mock infected or infected. they were then treated with IFN- (10 U/ml) or IFN- (10 U/ml) for different times. titers of progeny virus in PEDV-infected vero E6 cells were significantly lower in cells treated with either inhibitor than in control-treated cells. ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated STAT1 degradation promotes PEDV replication. titer was determined by the TCID50 assay. vero E6 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1/STAT1 or pcDNA3.1 vector. at 24 h posttransfection, vero E6 cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h or 48 h. results represent means SD for three independent experiments. PEDV-infected vero E6 cells were infected either with NDV-GFP at an MOI of 0.01, as a control, or with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. at 24 h post-IFN- treatment, PEDV-infected cells were stained with a MAb to PEDV spike protein. PEDV infection reduces expression levels of STAT1 but not STAT2 in PEDV-infected cells. cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h or 48 h. PEDV downregulation of STAT1 could be caused by incoming virions or viral replication products. we inactivated PEDV virions by UV illumination and verified the inactivation by Western blotting after inoculation of vero E6 cells. similar results were observed in IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV promotes STAT1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. in eukaryotic cells, there are two major intracellular protein degradation pathways. proteasomal degradation pathway has high selectivity. autophagy is a highly conserved process for degrading redundant cellular components. we analyzed whether autophagy was involved in STAT1 degradation. 3-MA treatment did not inhibit STAT1 degradation. these data indicate that PEDV induces STAT1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were treated either with 3-MA (5 mM) or with the carrier control DMSO for 4 h prior to PEDV infection. phosphorylated STAT1 levels were increased at early time points and decreased after 24 h postinfection. PEDV-infected cells failed to activate STAT1 in IFN-treated cells. established PEDV infection interrupts the IFN-I-mediated JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway. phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 degraded by PEDV. phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 are degraded by PEDV. both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 are degraded by PEDV. both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1 are degraded. p-STAT1 levels were significantly lower in PEDV-infected cells than in uninfected cells. p-STAT1 levels in response to IFN- were slightly reduced in vero E6 cells. these signals might be transmitted through a distinct but overlapping pathway. protease inhibitor MG132 can significantly inhibit STAT1 degradation in PEDV-infected cells. reduction in titers of progeny virus in MG132-treated cells was confirmed by measuring the TCID50. titers of progeny virus in MG132-treated cells were significantly lower in cells treated with either inhibitor. the progeny viruses were recovered from culture fluids at 24 h or 48 h postinfection. the virus titer was determined by the TCID50 assay. PEDV infection inhibits the IFN response signaling pathway. this is a unique example of a coronavirus that directly degrades an IFN response protein to enable its survival. this is a unique example of a coronavirus that directly degrades an IFN response protein to enable its survival. hepatitis C virus and simian virus 5 selectively degrade STAT1 in a proteasome-dependent manner (52, 54, 60) hepatitis C virus and simian virus 5 selectively degrade STAT1 in a proteasome-dependent manner. hepatitis C virus and simian virus 5 have evolved similar mechanisms for the evasion of host defenses. different viruses may use similar mechanisms to circumvent IFN action."}
