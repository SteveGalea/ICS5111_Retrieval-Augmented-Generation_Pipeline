{"summary": "the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL6R) is expressed predominantly by hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes (1, 2). the circulating soluble form of the IL6R (sIL6R) is generated by two independent mechanisms. the first is shed from the cell surface via proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound IL6R (PC-sIL6R) (5, 6), while the second is the human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophic cytokine that exerts a neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. an extracellular portion of its receptor has been shown to be homologous with the IL6R (10) IL-27 consists of the cytokine subunit p28 and the nonsignaling -receptor EBI3. the production of type I IFNs is controlled by the transcription factor NF-B. the NF-B family consists of five members, p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB. each member possesses an N-terminal Rel homology domain. IL-6 production in follicular B cells in the draining lymph node is a necessary early event during the antiviral response that is sufficient to induce critical cytokines. the IL-6/sIL6R complex is critically involved in the maintenance of a disease state, by promoting the transition from acute to chronic inflammation. serum and throat swab samples were collected from 17 healthy individuals and 17 IAV-infected patients admitted to the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. written informed consent was obtained from each participant. RNAs (siRNAs) and irrelevant control siRNAs (si-nc) were purchased from GenePharma with the following sequences: si-COX-2, 5\u2032-GGACUUAUUGGGUAAUGUUATT-3\u2032; si-p28, 5\u2032-UCCCUUCUCAATT-3\u2032; si-CNTF, 5\u2032-GCUGAUGGGAUGCCUATUUAT-3\u2032. antibodies against sIL6R, IL-6 samples were washed twice in saline and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. human alveolar type II (AT II) cells were isolated from deidentified lungs that were not suitable for transplantation. qRT-PCR was performed using a lightCycler 480 system (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) with the following primers. a well with DMSO was agitated for 10 min on a shaker. a well with DMSO but without cells was used to adjust the zero value. luciferase reporter assays were used to measure luciferase activity of each sample 48 h after transfection. cells were plated at a density of 4 105 per 24-well or 6-well plate. luciferase activity was determined as internal controls for transfection efficiency. nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 1 min. pellets and cytosolic protein-containing supernatants were collected. a 100-g aliquot of each sample was subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. core-associated HBV DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. qRT-PCR was performed using a lightCycler 480 system (Roche) qRT-PCR was performed, and the results analyzed. 5\u2032-ATCAGACCGAACGAGAGAATCCAGC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-GGAGGCCCTCTGTTGATTAGTGT-3\u2032 (antisense). -actin, 5\u2032-TCTGTCAGGGTTGGAAAGTC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-AAATGCAAACCGCTTCCAAC-3\u2032 (antisense) (29). Statistical analysis. All experiments were performed in duplicate or quadruplicate. the human enterovirus 71 strain used in this study is from Xiangyang (GenBank accession number JN230523.1). pCMV-COX-2 expression plasmid pCMV-COX-2 has been described previously (29). pHBV-1.3 was generated from the HBV genome as described previously (30). recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) protein was purchased from eBioscience. tetrazolium bromide was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and was stirred with a constant-temperature magnetic stirrer. qRT-PCR analysis was performed using a lightCycler 480 system. qRT-PCR was performed using a lightCycler 480 system. GGCATCTCA-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-TGCACAGCTCTGTTGTTCCTC-3\u2032 (antisense); for IFN-, 5\u2032-AAAGAAGCCTGAAGGACAG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CCTTGGTAATGCA-3\u2032 (antisense); for Mx, 5\u2032-GCCGGCTGTGGATATGCTA-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-CCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACC the protein concentration of each sample was determined using a Bradford assay kit. a 100-g aliquot of each sample was subject to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. a human sIL6R Quantikine ELISA kit and a human IL-6 Valukine ELISA kit were used (R&D Systems) to determine the amounts of sIL6R and IL-6 secreted into culture supernatants. qRT-PCR was performed using a lightCycler 480 system (Roche) mRNA were detected with reverse transcription primers and qRT-PCR test primers. the following primers were used for reverse transcription: for NP, 5\u2032-CTCACCGAGAGAGAGAATCATG-3\u2032; for NP-cRNA, 5\u2032-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTTTTTTTTAATTGTCAT-3\u2032; and for NP-mRNA, oligo(dT) IAV induces sIL6R expression, and NS398 downregulates sIL6R. sIL6R mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. sIL6R mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. the levels of sIL6R mRNA (top graphs) and secreted sIL6R protein (bottom graphs) were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. we used a shedding inhibitor to block proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound IL6R. previous protein chip results suggested that sIL6R was one of the cellular factors whose expression was affected by COX-2. NS398 treatment suppressed sIL6R mRNA and protein levels significantly relative to those for the dimethyl sulfoxide control. sIL6R expression is regulated by the COX-2 pathway. COX-2 knockdown inhibited sIL6R expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. prostaglandin E2, the main metabolite of COX-2, also induced sIL6R mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. nonsense control siRNA for 4 h before infection with IAV (MOI, 1) for 24 h. levels of sIL6R mRNA, sIL6R protein, and COX-2 protein were determined by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting. COX-2-regulated sIL6R expression is independent of IL-6. levels of sIL6R mRNA and protein were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. sIL6R but not IL-6 elicits extensive antiviral activity. A549 cells were transfected with pCMV-sIL6R for 48 h. levels of sIL6R protein were measured by ELISA. levels of IL-6 protein were measured by ELISA. supernatants were harvested at 24 hpi and were analyzed for VSV production. the number of EV71 copies was determined by qRT-PCR. the dagger indicates a significant difference (P 0.01) from untreated EV71-infected cells. sIL6R-treated cells showed a lower cytopathic effect than control cells at 24 hpi. the number of infected cells decreased from 96% to 48% following sIL6R overexpression. RD cells were treated with either rhsIL6R protein (40 ng/ml), rhIL-6 protein (40 ng/ml) and rhIL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 6 h. no antiviral activity was observed in vero cells. sIL6R induces type I IFN production in A549 cells. sIL6R induces type I IFN production in A549 cells. qRT-PCR of A549 cells and PBMCs incubated with rhsIL6R for 24 h showed that IFN- expression increased significantly in the presence of rhsIL6R. the level of IFN- mRNA increased dramatically in A549 cells but only slightly in PBMCs. A549 cells and freshly isolated PBMCs were treated with rhsIL6R protein (40 ng) or a control. levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR. levels of OAS, PKR, and Mx mRNA in PBMCs were determined by qRT-PCR. sIL6R induces type I IFN expression and activates IFN downstream effectors. sIL6R can also bind to CNTF (11), p28 (14) and gp130. AT II cells (B), and PBMCs (C) were infected with IAV (MOI, 1) for 24 h. levels of p28, CNTF, and gp130 mRNA were analyzed by qRT-PCR. nonsense siRNA (si-nc) was used as a control. Relative levels of NP-specific vRNA were measured by qRT-PCR. A549 cells were cotransfected with si-p28 and pCMV-sIL6R for 8 h. the cells were then infected with IAV (MOI, 1) for the indicated times. silencing of p28 by si-p28 could reduce antiviral effect of sIL6R. sIL6R mediated antiviral activity, at least in part, through the p28 pathway. cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared from sIL6R-transfected cells. levels of IRF3, RelA, and NF-B1 proteins were detected by Western blotting. cells were immunostained with antibodies against IRF3 (B), RelA (C) and NF-B1 (D) sIL6R expression is elevated in patients infected with influenza virus or HBV. 13.5 Gender (no. male/female) 6/11 9/8 No. (%) of individuals Asian race or ethnicity 17 (100) 17 (100) Sample collection between 11/8/2011 and 1/19/2012 17 (100) 17 (100) HA antigen positive NA 17 (100) No. with viral genotype A (H3/H1) NA 17 (13/4) sIL6R/GAPDH mRNA level (fold) 2.9 2.7 8.4 6.3 a HA, 6R and viral NP levels in throat swab samples were subjected to correlation analysis (n = 23) broken arrows indicate potential signaling pathways. sIL6R activates type I IFN expression through the p28 pathway. sIL6R mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. AT II cells were inoculated with IAV for 1 h at an MOI of 1. sIL6R mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors are known to prevent the shedding of various cell surface proteins (34\u201336), including the IL-6R (6, 37) this indicated that the IAV-induced release of the sIL6R in A549 cells was not blocked by TAPI. NS398 was used as the selective COX-2 inhibitor in the following experiments. treatment suppressed sIL6R mRNA and protein levels in human PBMCs. NS398 treatment decreased both sIL6R mRNA and protein levels in PBMCs. sIL6R expression is regulated by the COX-2 pathway. X-2 knockdown inhibited sIL6R expression in PBMCs. prostaglandin E2, the main metabolite of COX-2, also induced sIL6R mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. levels of sIL6R mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR. the results thus far showed that IAV infection led to increased sIL6R expression via COX-2. sIL6R expression may be independent of IL-6, which itself is unable to stimulate the expression of sIL6R. levels of sIL6R mRNA and protein were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. sIL6R but not IL-6 elicits extensive antiviral activity. rhsIL6R (rhsIL6R) protein (40 ng/ml), rhIL-6 protein (40 ng/ml) and rhIL-6 (20 ng/ml) were cultured for 24 h. levels of STAT3 phosphorylation (P-STAT3) were measured by Western blotting. supernatants were harvested for 6 h, infected with EV71 (MOI, 1) or inactivated EV71 (mock) and then cultured for 12 h. dagger indicates a significant difference (P 0.01) from untreated EV71-infected cells. sIL6R-treated cells showed a lower cytopathic effect than control cells at 24 hpi. RD cells were treated with either rhsIL6R protein (40 ng/ml), rhIL-6 protein (40 ng/ml) or both rhsIL6R and rhIL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 6 h. treatment with rhsIL6R effectively reduced the level of viral VP1 mutation in the dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (41\u201343) have much lower type I IFN levels than Huh7 cells. sIL6R significantly suppressed HBV DNA replication in Huh7 cells. sIL6R but not IL-6 exerts a universal antiviral function in response to infection by different viruses. V-sIL6R expression decreased significantly after sIL6R expression. qRT-PCR of A549 cells and PBMCs incubated with rhsIL6R for 24 h. levels of IFN- mRNA increased dramatically in A549 cells. levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR. levels of OAS, PKR, and Mx mRNA in PBMCs were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. sIL6R also increased the mRNA levels of each IFN- effector examined. p28 levels were significantly increased in all three types of cells. PBMCs were either left untreated or treated with rhsIL6R protein. p28, CNTF, and gp130 mRNA were analyzed by qRT-PCR. levels of p28, CNTF, and gp130 measured by qRT-PCR. mRNA levels of p28, CNTF, and gp130 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. nonsense siRNA (si-nc) was used as a control. cells were cotransfected with pCMV-sIL6R and si-p28 for 8 h. cells were then infected with IAV (MOI, 1) for 12 h. silencing of p28 by si-p28 could reduce antiviral effect of sIL6R. cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared from sIL6R-transfected cells. levels of IRF3, RelA, and NF-B1 protein within the nucleus increased. cytosolic levels decreased over time in sIL6R-transfected cells. sIL6R mRNA levels from throat swab samples were approximately 3-fold higher in IAV patients than in healthy individuals. viral NP mRNA levels correlated positively with sIL6R mRNA levels in throat swabs (R = 0.61) sIL6R/GAPDH mRNA level (fold) 2.9 2.7 8.4 6.3 a HA, hemagglutinin. b NA, not applicable. Table 2. sil6R levels in PBMCs from healthy individuals. the enhanced sIL6R activates type I IFN expression through the p28 pathway, leading to the activation of downstream effectors and the inhibition of viral replication. there are other potential signaling pathways that may regulate sIL6R-mediated antiviral function. sIL6R was induced by COX-2 independently of IL-6, suggesting a novel pathway of regulating sIL6R expression. sIL6R suppressed EV71 and HBV replication. no synergistic effects were observed when cells were treated with both sIL6R and IL-6. neutralizing antibodies against IFN- and IFN- to reverse sIL6R-induced inhibition of VSV further confirmed the activation of sIL6R-mediated antiviral activity by type I IFNs. both IFN- and IFN- were induced by the sIL6R in A549 cells, while only IFN- levels were significantly increased in PBMCs. p28 contributes, at least in part, to sIL6R-mediated antiviral function. other potential pathways may also regulate sIL6R-mediated antiviral action. further study is needed to address this hypothesis. comparison of serum IL-6 concentrations uncovered no differences between responders and nonresponders. there are conflicting findings about IL-6 function during hepatitis B virus infection. one study reported that IL-6 affected HBV at the level of transcription."}
