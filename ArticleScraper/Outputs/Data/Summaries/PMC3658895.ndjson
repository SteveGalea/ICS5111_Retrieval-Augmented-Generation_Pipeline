{"summary": "despite increasing demands to produce timely and relevant research findings, our traditional research process remains painstakingly slow. despite increasing demands to produce timely and relevant research findings, our current research enterprise is too slow, inefficient, and cumbersome to meet the rapidly evolving demand. proposed approaches to make research more rapid, responsive and relevant (R3) are organized into four sections for a purpose: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) design, 3) review, and 4) infrastructure. these suggested approaches are viewed as a starting point for a dialogue among the health research community to challenge our current cumbersome research enterprise. reviewers to consider innovative designs that speed research &z.cirf; Streamlined grant review process &z.cirf; Encourage online and open access publication &z.cirf; Incentives to speed manuscript reviews Infrastructure Issues &z.cirf; Use of data standards and common data elements to improve research efficiency. the NIH Health Care System Collaboratory (HCSC) offers an important resource for rapid research. the HCSC will make available opportunities to conduct large-scale studies within well-organized healthcare delivery systems. accelerated research system can also use information technologies to speed the process of seeking and obtaining stakeholder feedback. trials that utilize within-group designs can speed the research process by reducing the number of study participants needed to detect outcomes. the VA is adopting a point of care randomization that computer-randomizes patients to different treatments, and then uses adaptive algorithms to change allocation of new patients as evidence accumulates. rapid review processes It takes 9 to 11 months from NIH grant submission to funding. if revised and resubmitted, it can take two years from initial submission to the award of a revised (A1) NIH grant application. research questions may become less relevant or timely. innovative designs, especially those that speed the pace of research relative to traditional designs, should be rewarded, not penalized. slowness of research should be considered a risk, both to study participants who may continue in their assigned treatment even as newer treatments become available, and to the wider public who are delayed getting answers to relevant research questions. the NIH Director has proposed a new national patient-oriented research system with electronic health records databases, including genomics, for 20\u201330 million patients. the big data to knowledge initiative provides the opportunity to leverage these large data sets for rapid research. there have been efforts to encourage the use of common data elements. the NIH Health Care System Collaboratory (HCSC) offers an important resource for rapid research. a virtual network of stakeholders can participate and provide feedback throughout the research process using online surveys, virtual meetings, and social media systems. trials can be rapidly implemented and provide results congruent with a more personalized medicine approach. a number of optimization approaches have also been used to optimize treatments. some optimization approaches may take more time than the traditional pilot trial. a range of within-subject and quasi-experimental designs may have less internal validity than the RCT, but offer a number of advantages. a range of within-subject and quasi-experimental designs may have less internal validity than the RCT, but offer a number of advantages. new technologies for publication, systematic reviews, and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines reduce the time from research findings to practitioner adoption. but the publication and dissemination process should continue to be reviewed to further reduce the time lapses between the various stages of the dissemination and implementation process. large biobanks are now coming on-line at Kaiser-Permanente, the Veterans Health Administration, and the UK Biobank [41] large future investments are now being considered that could offer extraordinary opportunities for researchers and a faster, more efficient infrastructure for rapid learning research. the NIH Director has proposed a new national patient-oriented research system with electronic health records databases. rapid learning systems of large patient populations appear to provide the infrastructure to rapidly evaluate treatments. this transformation to a rapid research learning system will require a concerted effort by research funders, academic institutions, healthcare systems, researchers, and a variety of practice, community, and policy stakeholders. the rationale and opportunities for such a culture change have never been greater or rapid answers more needed. authors\u2019 contributions WTR led the writing and preparation of this paper.
