{"summary": "extracellular microvesicles (ExMVs) have been found to facilitate cell-cell communication. this review will discuss recent studies of the composition and function of ExMVs during viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections. the exMVs released from cells during an infection can be either pathogen- or host-derived. the presence of signaling lipids, proteins, and various species of RNA within a single structure can lead to a rapid and profound change in the target cell. the responding cell can in turn release molecules, which can act locally or systemically. this makes the study of their activity difficult, as the effect of the vesicles is a result of all the different components within them. exosome production Turnover of plasma membrane receptors includes endocytosis and trafficking to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which can fuse with lysosomes to mediate protein degradation (13\u201315). exosome production Turnover of plasma membrane receptors includes endocytosis. pathogens have been shown to hijack the host exosome biosynthetic machinery. pathogens have been shown to modulate the exosome biosynthetic pathway by affecting recruitment of host factors to MVBs. exosome protein composition can also mark the existence of disease pathology such as cancers or inflammatory diseases. exosome lipid composition has also been well characterized (27). a number of reviews have highlighted the protein and lipid content of exosomes. king of mycobacterial proteins to exosomes is dependent on host E3 ligase\u2013mediated ubiquitination (33) the presence of mRNA and miR in both the cytoplasm and endosomal compartments is unknown. a significant area of ongoing research stems from pioneering work done by Ratajczak et al. (34) and Valadi et al. (35) the mechanism by which EAP30 facilitates HIV-1 genomic RNA trafficking remains unclear. unspliced HIV-1 RNA species are also recruited to exosomes. this recruitment is dependent on the 5\u2032 end of the Gag p17 ORF (42) microvesicles released by infected cells contain soluble DC-SIGN. release of this complex appears to increase the susceptibility of recipient cells to CMV infection. exosomes and other ExMVs released from HIV-1\u2013infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or from megakaryocytes and platelets contain CCR5 and CXCR4 respectively. exosomes release exosomes or microvesicles (MVs) and BMVs. exosomes from m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages or from leishmania gp63 can inhibit immune response. exosomes from m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages can also limit proinflammatory response in target macrophages. exosomes from EBV-infected cells release exosomes containing EBV miRs that induce miR-mediated repression of EBV target genes. a similar effect was seen in vivo, as mice treated with L. major\u2013 and L. donovani\u2013released exosomes prior to infection had a higher parasite load compared with that detected in untreated mice. exosomes from M. tuberculosis\u2013infected macrophages contain lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which inhibits T cell receptor signaling and T cell responses. exosomes released from epithelial cells following Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection contain elevated levels of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2), which may suppress apoptosis of epithelial cells and limit IL-1 exosomes can carry toxins, as shown by Abrami and colleagues. exosomes can carry antigen carriers, promoting an acquired immune response. exosomes can also carry toxins, as shown by abrami and colleagues. exosomes, such as those released from human endothelial cells, can stimulate memory CD4+ T cells isolated from CMV-infected donors. exosomes can stimulate a protective immune response against acute and chronic T. gondii infection. exosome-mediated antigen delivery is not limited to viral infections. vaccination of mice with exosomes released from infected macrophages protects against a low-dose, aerosolized M. tuberculosis inoculation. exosomes and other exMVs released from virus-, parasite-, and bacteria-infected cells also contain PAMPS that can stimulate macrophage production of proinflammatory mediators like TNF-. exosomes released from EBV-infected cells have also been shown to contain dUTPase. exosomes can induce a proinflammatory/antiviral response through activation of NF-B and production of cytokines. this activity is dependent on viral RNA present within the exosomes. microvesicles isolated from malaria-infected mice induce potent, TLR4-dependent activation of macrophages in vitro. exosomes released from mycobacterium avium\u2013infected macrophages stimulated a proinflammatory response in noninfected macrophages. exosomes released from M. tuberculosis\u2013infected macrophages were also shown to be proinflammatory (95) exosomes and other ExMVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many different viruses. transfer of host and viral proteins and/or RNA could enhance viral infection and replication in recipient cells. transfer of host and viral proteins and/or RNA could inhibit the immune response through induction of apoptosis or by blocking key cellular responses. exosomes and other extracellular vesicles can inhibit an immune response. exosomes from m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages or from leishmania gp63 can also limit proinflammatory response in target macrophages and DCs. exosomes from m. tuberculosis-infected macrophages can also limit proinflammatory response in target macrophages. exosomes from EBV-infected cells release exosomes containing EBV miRs that induce miR-mediated repression of target genes such as CXCL11 (58) exosomes are a vehicle for leishmania protein secretion and uptake by target macrophages (59), thereby suppressing the immune response. s containing GP63 released from infected macrophages target pre-miR processor dicer1 in hepatocytes to prevent miR/ribonucleoprotein complex (miRNP) formation. thereby blocking production of miR122, which results in altered serum cholesterol concentration and higher parasite burden. studies with mycobacterial components present on or in exosomes have been shown to suppress the immune response. exosomes may suppress apoptosis of epithelial cells and limit IL-1 production. exosomes can carry toxins, as shown by Abrami and colleagues. exosomes can also carry toxins, as shown by colleagues. exosomes, such as those released from CMV-infected human endothelial cells, can stimulate memory CD4+ T cells isolated from CMV-infected donors. exosome-mediated antigen delivery is not limited to viral infections. exosome-mediated antigen delivery is not limited to viral infections. vaccination of mice with exosomes released from CFP-treated macrophages protects against a low-dose, aerosolized M. tuberculosis inoculation. exosomes and other ExMVs released from virus-, parasite-, and bacteria-infected cells can function through antigen cross priming to activate antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. exosomes containing cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G can inhibit HIV replication in recipient cells. exosomes released from EBV-infected cells have also been shown to contain dUTPase. this activity is dependent on viral RNA present within the exosomes. exosomes released from mycobacterium avium\u2013infected macrophages stimulated a proinflammatory response in noninfected macrophages in a TLR- and MyD88-dependent manner. exosomes released from M. tuberculosis\u2013 or BCG-infected macrophages were also shown to be proinflammatory (95), and exosomes isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of BCG- the interest in using exosomes and other ExMVs as vaccines has increased dramatically over the past few years. the interest in using exosomes and other ExMVs as vaccines has increased dramatically over the past few years. exosomes released from BMDCs pulsed with S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 14 (Cps14) antigen could stimulate protective IgM and IgG responses against S. pneumoniae infection (107). exosomes could be used as cell-free vaccines, but there are both practical and conceptual issues that need to be addressed prior to their use in humans. exosome concentration in serum from BCG- or M. tuberculosis\u2013infected mice was significantly higher when compared with serum exosomes from uninfected controls. this concentration correlated with bacterial load (45), suggesting that exosomes could be used as markers of active disease. exosomes are not limited to pathogen-derived molecules, as host components may differ qualitatively and quantitatively between exosomes from an infected individual and those from uninfected exosomes may reveal functions and mechanisms that could be incorporated into the design of artificial vesicle nanoparticles for drug delivery and other therapeutic applications. there are a number of potential advantages to using exosomes as vaccines against pathogens. exosomes used for large-scale vaccination will likely be produced from a human cell line and therefore will have proteins and other molecules specific to this cell line. the effect of these foreign antigens on the recipient\u2019s immune response is unclear, and additional studies are needed to delineate potential risks. tuberculosis\u2013infected mice or the serum of tuberculosis (TB) patients contained mycobacterial proteins, suggesting exosomes could be used as markers of active disease. exosomes are not limited to pathogen-derived molecules, as host components may differ qualitatively and quantitatively between exosomes from an infected individual and those from uninfected individuals. growth in this area should lead to a better understanding of virulence mechanisms and immune responses as well as the development of new diagnostics and vaccines. this will require developing a better understanding of the cell types that produce ExMVs and how this changes during an infection."}
