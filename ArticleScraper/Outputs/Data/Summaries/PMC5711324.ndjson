{"summary": "GHSA was launched in february 2014 at the US Department of Health and Human Services. it comprised representatives of 26 nations, WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the world organisation for animal health (OIE) to prevent, detect, and respond to serious infectious disease threats. GHSA evaluation tool would be used to establish a national baseline for GHSA capacities across the agenda\u2019s 11 technical areas. the findings of the assessments highlighted gaps in the IHR 2005 core capacities for these countries in detecting, notifying, and responding to EVD that the annual self-reporting monitoring tool did not identify. the results were a proxy measure of the capacity of the country to manage a specific outbreak. the consolidated voluntary JEE tool is part of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (IHRMEF) across 19 core preparedness and response capacities for infectious disease, chemical, radiologic, and nuclear threats (10). the tool incorporates all elements of the IHR 2005 (2) and the global health security agenda (ghsagenda.org/) external assessment team reviews the JEE self-assessment with the host country through 19 facilitated, multisectoral discussions. the process brings together a multisectoral approach (e.g., animal and human health, food and agriculture, and security and law enforcement), enabling engagement and cooperation. a final report is developed, shared with the country, and posted publicly. the country is expected to use the JEE report and other relevant assessments to develop a national action plan for health security or update an existing national action plan with associated costs. the strategic partnership portal is a 1-stop portal to facilitate sharing of information about current and future activities and investments. it is intended to monitor and map all contributions (e.g., financial, technical, in-kind, and in-service) from donors and partners to facilitate alignment of in-country efforts. a strong team lead was an important contributor to a successful mission with a timely and accurate report. the training was piloted at the WHO regional office in brazzaville, Congo, during October 18\u201320, 2016. a total of 17 team leads from various key partners were trained. the external team reviews and validates the country\u2019s self-assessment using the JEE tool. an incomplete, superficial, or less-than-timely country self-assessment can make it difficult for the external evaluation team to accurately assess a country\u2019s health systems\u2019 capacities if documentation and confirming evidence is lacking. consolidated global roster of SMEs will be added to the JEE\u2019s national legislative, policy, and finance technical area. referencing and linking with other technical areas will be improved, including scoring issues related to human and animal health technical areas. a total of 17 team leads from various key partners were trained. the second training occurred in Lyon, France, during January 31\u2013February 1, 2017. team leads who have been trained in facilitation, a common approach to applying the JEE tool. t developed guidance and materials based on the EMRO model to provide support and assistance to countries in implementing their self-assessment. feedback was solicited from team members, technical experts, and the regional offices engaged in implementing the tool. some elements of the tool might need to be modified to resolve outstanding concerns discussed during the April 19\u201321, 2017, WHO consultation on the tool. GHSA has created entities to support and accelerate the IHR 2005 implementation. the alliance for country assessments for global health security and IHR implementation is drawn from 12 countries (2 from each WHO region); 4 nongovernment organizations and foundations; and 4 multilateral organizations. global health security relies on all countries working together to develop and maintain core capacities required under the IHR 2005 implementation. all member states have the capacity to rapidly detect, verify, notify, and respond effectively to all public health threats while limiting the international spread of disease and its effect on travel and trade. the IHRMEF can help measure progress and realign country plans as needed. countries and partners need to commit to working together to implement national plans of action expediently and effectively."}
