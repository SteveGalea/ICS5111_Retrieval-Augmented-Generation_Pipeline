{"summary": "ALI/ARDS is one of the main causes of death in intensive care units. IAV infection can increase expressions of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and myD88. fractory to IAV-induced ALI, and TLR4 antagonist eritoran can decrease viral titer and IAV-induced lethality [15]. Activation of TLR7/8-MyD88 signaling can effectively suppress IAV replication and IAV-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) oprotective, and immunosuppression activities are widely employed to treat viral hepatitis, traumatic brain injury, acute pancreatitis, sepsis, and ALI in the clinic [23,24,25]. in the previous study, we found that OMT, at a low concentration, only inhibits IAV infection in vitro, but cannot in vivo. cytotoxicity of OMT was determined by a MTT method on A549 cells. data shown were mean SD, n = 3, * p 0.05, compared with the 0 g/mL group. the effect of OMT on IAV replication was determined by a plaque inhibition assay. the inhibition of OMT on IAV replication only occurred during 1\u20135 h post infection (p.i.) the antiviral activity of OMT on different IAV strains was detected by the SRB method, MOI = 0.001. significantly decrease IAV-induced high expressions of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TRAF6 genes in A549 cells. effect of OMT on promoter transcription activity of TLRs, TRIF, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes. OMT could significantly inhibit phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK. but not significantly on IAV-induced phosphorylation of JNK. pNF-B-luc reporter plasmid has 4 duplicated NF-B response elements. luciferase activity was determined following the instruments of luciferase reporter plasmid assay kit. concentrations of ribavirin and OMT were 25 and 50 g/mL respectively. ribavirin (25 g/mL) and OMT (50 g/mL) were treated with or without ribavirin (25 g/mL) and OMT (50 g/mL) and simultaneously treated with or without TLR3 activator (polyI:C, 100 ng/mL), TLR4 activator LPS-B5 (1 g/mL), PI-3K/Akt activator (IGF-1, 100 ng/m a549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h, then infected with or without IAV (ST169, H1N1), MOI = 0.001. in the ribavirin- and OMT-treated groups, the cells were further treated with ribavirin (25 g/mL) and OMT (50 g/mL) transcriptions of IL-6, TNF-, and IL-1 significantly reduce the pulmonary viral load, determined at day 6 p.i. compared with the 60 mg/kg/day- OMT-treated group, OMT at 120 mg/kg/day could further reduce the lung index and viral titers. however, in the qRT-PCR assay, IAV M2 vRNA level was significantly decreased in 120 mg/kg/day OMT-treated group. the levels of IL-6, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-10 in lung homogenates were determined by the qRT-PCR assay at day 6 p.i. (n = 6) data shown were mean SD. * p 0.05, compared with the NC (DMSO + virus + oseltamivir) group. OMT significantly reduced the viability of A549 cells at the concentration of 800 g/mL; y = 0.061ln(x) + 1.0976, R2 = 0.9923, CC50 = 65,986.53 g/mL. MDCK cells were infected with IAV (ST169) and treated with ribavirin (25 g/mL) and OMT (400, 200, 100 and 50 g/mL, respectively), MOI = 0.001, the incubation time was 48 h. besides ST169 (H1N1), OMT also could significantly inhibit PR8 (H1N1), ST1233 (H1N1), HKG1 (H9N2), GDA1 (H 8, ST1233, HKG1, GDA1, GD105, ST602 and ST364 were detected by the SRB method. the antiviral activity of OMT against IAV (ST169) infection at different MOI (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1) was detected by the SRB method. p 0.05, compared with the DMSO + virus (Vir) group. effects of OMT on expressions of TLR3/4/7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes were determined by western blotting assay. pNF-B-luc reporter plasmid has 4 duplicated NF-B response elements. OMT inhibited IAV-induced activation of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-B signal pathways. TLR4 activator (LPS-B5), p38 MAPK activator (Anisomycin) and NF-B activator (PMA) could significantly antagonize the inhibitory effect of OMT on IAV-induced decrease of cell viability determined by the SRB method. the effects of TLR3 activator (polyI:C), TLR7/8 activator (R-848), PI-3K/Akt activator (IGF-1) and ERK1/2 activ activator (EGF, 100 ng/mL), p38/JNK activator (Anisomycin, 10 M), and NF-B activator (PMA, 1 g/mL) after 48 h, cell viability was determined by the SRB method (A) and IAV vRNA levels were determined by a qRT-PCR assay (B) after 48 h, the supernatants and cells were collected and used in the ELISA assay. data shown were mean SD of three independent experiments with three replicates. p 0.05, compared with the DMSO + virus (Vir) group. mice were intranasally infected with 10 MLD50 of IAV (PR8) and treated with 0.5% DMSO, oseltamivir (10 mg/kg/day) and OMT (60 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage from day 1 to day 5 p.i. the lungs of the NC group showed significant alveolar exudation, thickening or destruction of alveolar wall, and alveolar hemorrhage. oseltamivir and OMT could significantly inhibit these histopathological changes induced by IAV (PR8) infection. at day 6 p.i., six mice from each group were sacrificed. sophora root and its major active compound OMT have been used for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis in the clinic for many years. the composite sophora japonica injection (mainly containing OMT) has distinct effects in the treatment of SARS, which has displayed the magical power of OMT to treat systemic inflammatory responses. activations of PI3K/Akt and downstream cascades of TLR signaling pathways are also reported to be essential for IAV infection. p38 MAPK is a key determinant of virus entry and tissue tropism. vRNA synthesis has shown that OMT can significantly decrease IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-B pathways. only TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-B activators can counteract the anti-IAV activity of OMT, including IAV-induced CPE and IAV replication. AV-induced productions of inflammatory cytokines and MMP-2/-9 may be, at least in part, via inhibiting MAPK and NF-B pathways. it has been reported that OMT can protect the brain from damage through down-regulating the TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF-B pathways. oleic acid-induced ALI in mice and cecal ligation and puncture-induced septic shock in rat have shown that OMT possesses an excellent activity to inhibit systemic inflammatory responses. anti-inflammatory drugs are divided into steroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
