{"summary": "equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) the consequences of arterivirus infection can range from an asymptomatic, persistent or acute infection to abortion or lethal haemorrhagic fever. replicative enzymes are encoded by the 5\u2032-proximal replicase ORFs 1a and 1b, yielding two long non-structural polyproteins. replicative enzymes are processed into at least 13 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) by three or four viral proteinases encoded by ORF1a. ORFs 2a\u20137 encode seven structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein and six envelope proteins, the glycoproteins (GP) GP2, GP3, GP4 and GP5, and the non-glycosylated envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. expression of each of these proteins was found to be critical for production of infectious progeny. the positions of the ORFs encoding the seven known structural proteins and the newly discovered ORF5a are indicated. small grey boxes indicate the positions of the TRS that direct sg synthesis and serve as junction sequences for the 5\u2032 common leader sequence of arterivirus mRNAs. the mlogd signal tends to be weaker within regions of high conservation. a dashed vertical line indicates the 3\u2032 end of the common ORF5a variant (46 codons instead of 51 codons) in PRRSV-NA. results and discussion Computational analysis reveals the presence of a small ORF overlapping the arterivirus GP5 gene. mlogd uses nucleotide and amino acid substitution matrices to model sequence evolution in dual-coding, single-coding and non-coding regions. it can be used to predict whether query ORFs are likely to be coding sequences via an approximate likelihood-ratio test. the ORF5a initiation codon is boxed and the two residues mutated to knock out EAV ORF5a in mutant 5a-2 are indicated by arrows. the position of the putative transmembrane domain, as predicted by phobius, is indicated in yellow. SHFV, and again mlogd detected a positive coding signature for ORF5a using sequence alignments of PRRSV-EU, EAV and LDV. the presence of this ORF in EAV, though not its bioinformatic coding signature, had previously been noted by Pasternak et al. (2000). the newly discovered ORF5a has 59 codons in EAV, 43 codons in PRRSV-NA, 43 codons in PRRSV-EU, 47 codons in LDV and 64 codons in SHFV. the ORF5a protein is a type III membrane protein with a short (5\u201312 aa) lumenal domain at its amino terminus, a central signal-anchor/transmembrane sequence, and a cytosolic neither the ORF5 nor ORF5a initiation codons have a guanine at the +4 position, but all five arterivirus ORF5 initiation codons have an adenine at the 3 position. in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, where the ORF5a AUG codon is 5\u2032, there is the potential for efficient leaky scanning to the ORF5 initiation codon. some 10 800 sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a/ORF5 region were analysed. 136 EAV, 445 PRRSV-NA, 622 PRRSV-EU, 1 SHFV and 5 LDV sequences have coverage of the ORF5a initiation site. a very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective. either premature ORF5a-frame termination codons or substitutions within the ORF5a initiation codon were found. similar numbers of GP5-defective sequences were found during the analysis. dual-labelling immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy for replicase (nsp3) and N protein was performed to verify comparable transfection efficiency. viral RNA synthesis in transfected cells was also analysed by Northern blot hybridization. both IF microscopy and hybridization analysis of intracellular viral RNA demonstrated that the two ORF5a knockout mutants were viable. however, the analysis of viral progeny released into the medium of transfected cells revealed that in both virus backbones, 5a-2 plaque sizes and titres are severely reduced compared with those of the corresponding parental virus. a second, virulent EAV isolate and in natural host cells EAV strains can differ significantly in the severity of the disease they induce in their natural host. 5a-2 mutant displayed crippled phenotype with tiny plaques. infectivity titres reduced by at least two logs. expression of ORF5a is critical for efficient EAV amplification. plaque size was observed for wild-type virus. a growth curve experiment in which GFP- and ORF5a-expressing cells were infected with 5a-2 mutant virus showed that the 5a-2 titre increased up to fivefold in the ORF5a-expressing cells. complete complementation to wild-type plaque size and titre could not be achieved. a 10 nt segment starting with the ORF5 initiation codon can now be assumed to encode amino acids for three different proteins, GP4, the ORF5a protein and GP5, in three different reading frames. previous attempts to engineer EAV-based vectors might, unknowingly, have been affected by the presence of ORF5a. er-Leu inserted after the amino-terminal Met-Phe was tolerated. the 24 nt-sequence served to insert additional foreign sequences. the instability and crippled or non-viable phenotypes reported for some of these constructs could be explained. a recent proteomics analysis of purified PRRSV-NA did identify several peptides from the ORF5a protein of the porcine arterivirus. the combined data now obtained for PRRSV-NA and EAV strongly suggest that the ORF5a protein is the eighth structural protein of the arterivirus particle. mlogd uses nucleotide and amino acid substitution matrices to model sequence evolution in dual-coding, single-coding and non-coding regions. PRRSV-NA reference sequence, NC_001961 (15 428 nt), ORF5a covers nucleotides 13 778\u201313 930 (51 codons) and therefore overlaps the 5\u2032 end of the GP5 CDS (nucleotides 13 788\u201314 390) by 48 codons (24 % of the GP5 gene) in the +2 reading frame. ORF5a begins immediately 3\u2032 of the ORF4 termination codon the ORF5a protein is predicted to be a type III membrane protein. a similar ORF5a was identified in PRRSV-EU and other arteriviruses, EAV and LDV. mlogd detected a positive coding signature for ORF5a. newly discovered ORF5a has 59 codons in EAV, either 51 or 46 codons in PRRSV-NA, 43 codons in PRRSV-EU, 47 codons in LDV and 64 codons in SHFV. the newly discovered ORF5a protein is a type III membrane protein with a short (5\u201312 aa) lumenal domain at its amino terminus and a central signal-anchor/transmembrane sequence. the ORF5a AUG codon is located just a few nucleotides 3\u2032 of the ORF5 initiation codon. in eukaryotes, the efficiency of translation initiation is modulated by the identity of the nucleotides surrounding the initiation codon. in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, the ORF5a AUG codon is located just a few nucleotides 3\u2032 of the ORF5 initiation codon some 10 800 sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a/ORF5 region were analysed. 136 EAV, 445 PRRSV-NA, 622 PRRSV-EU, 1 SHFV and 5 LDV sequences have coverage of the ORF5a initiation site. PRRSV-NA exhibits two main forms of differing lengths. a very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective. a very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective. in the second mutant a premature termination codon was engineered at codon six of ORF5a (G-11128A) the mutations introduced were translationally silent with respect to the overlapping GP4 gene. the phenotype of the ORF5a knockout mutants was compared with that of the wild-type control. no reversion was observed for mutant 5a-2, in which a double point mutation had been engineered. in both virus backbones, 5a-2 plaque sizes and titres are severely reduced compared with those of the parental virus. in vitro-synthesized full-length RNAs were transfected into equine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. in both virus backbones, the 5a-2 mutant displayed a crippled phenotype, with tiny plaques and infectivity titres reduced by at least two logs. despite bioinformatic evidence, we wanted to exclude the possibility that the crippled phenotype was due to damaging some unidentified yet important RNA Plaque assays of wild-type and 5a-2 virus were performed in both the ORF5a- and GFP-expressing cell cultures. the 5a-2 titre increased up to fivefold in the ORF5a-expressing cells. the expression of the ORF5a protein directly influences the EAV life cycle. a previously unrevealed short CDS in the 3\u2032-proximal domain of all arterivirus genomes is likely to be expressed from a functionally bicistronic sg mRNA. the overlapping GP5 gene are also likely to be expressed from a functionally bicistronic sg mRNA. a 10 nt segment starting with the ORF5 initiation codon can now be assumed to encode amino acids for three different proteins, ala and Tyr-15 with the sequence Cys-Glu-Leu-Lys-Gln-His-Ala-Val-His. a spontaneous insertion of 12 nt into ORF5a (Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu inserted after the amino-terminal Met-Phe) of PRRSV-NA was tolerated. a recent proteomics analysis of purified PRRSV-NA did identify several peptides from the ORF5a protein of the porcine arterivirus. however, the combined data now obtained for PRRSV-NA and EAV strongly suggest that the ORF5a protein is the eighth structural protein. PRRSV sequences were separated into PRRSV-NA and PRRSV-EU genotypes (with respect to GP5) based on the tblastn results. all but eight of the 10 359 sequences were cleanly separated. EEC cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.75 % carboxymethyl cellulose. pEAV515 is a derivative of the EAV cDNA clone pEAV030 (van Dinten et al., 1997). EAV515 virus has a wild-type phenotype, as determined by comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth-curve experiments and plaque assays. cells were seeded on coverslips, paraformaldehyde-fixed and double labelled for EAV nsp3 and N protein as described previously. omycin selection (5 g ml1) was applied from 24 h post-transfection onwards. a SinRep19 vector expressing GFP was used to produce a control cell line (BHK-SinRep19\u2013GFP) sequences with premature termination codons in ORF5 or ORF5a were also removed as being presumed-defective sequences. one EAV sequence with nine ambiguous nucleotide codes \u2013 indicative of poor sequence quality \u2013 was removed. pEAV515 is an infectious cDNA clone of the virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV. pEAV515 has a wild-type phenotype, as determined by comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth-curve experiments and plaque assays. PCR amplified using sense primer E1036 and antisense primer E1037. cloned between the MluI and SphI sites of the pSinRep19 multiple cloning site. F5 sequences were translated, aligned and back-translated to nucleotide sequence alignments using emboss and clustal. patent sequences and constructs were removed prior to analysis. sequences annotated as defective were inspected and removed. EEC cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.75 % carboxymethyl cellulose. pEAV515 is a derivative of the cDNA clone pEAV030. pEAV515 has a wild-type phenotype. cells were seeded on coverslips, paraformaldehyde-fixed and double labelled for EAV nsp3 and N protein. total RNA was isolated after 24 h by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the ORF5a region was amplified by RT-PCR."}
