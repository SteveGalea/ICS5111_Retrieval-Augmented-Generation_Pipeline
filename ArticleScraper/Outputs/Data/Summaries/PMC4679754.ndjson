{"summary": "the liver is the primary organ infected by, and in which both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicate. it has been reported that around 2 billion people are infected with HBV. more than 350 million are chronic carriers. autophagy is usually considered a very important step for numerous virus life cycles[11], including HBV and HCV[12]. autophagy is programmed cell death initiated via two different pathways. extrinsic which is activated by ligation of death receptors. intrinsic which is activated by mitochondrial death-related proteins. eIF2 results in a decrease in mRNA translation with concurrent translation increase of several mRNAs. previous investigations have shown that HBV[19-24] and HCV[25-27] infection can modulate apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR in different in vitro and non-human models. most of these studies did not use human samples and also have not simultaneously investigated apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR in the same infected tissue or organ biotin conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. hepatitis and normal liver tissue array (IC03001) was purchased from United States BioMax (Rockville, MD, United States) s hemochromatosis, drug induced liver disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or alcoholic liver diseases were excluded. patients were also excluded if pregnant, or if presented with comorbid conditions including diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. images were captured using a leica confocal microscope equipped with a spinning disc camera. laser intensity and detector sensitivity settings remained constant for all image acquisitions within each experiment. images were later analyzed with Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer, Woodbridge, ON, Canada) 0 = No fibrosis, 1-2 = Fibrous expansion of some and most portal areas (+/-) short fibrous septa, 3-4 = Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal (P-P) bridging. 5-6 = Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C), with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis), and Cirrhosis, probable or definite. non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test is equivalent nonparametric test of \"one-way analysis of variance\" LC3 antibody was obtained from Proteintech (18725-1-AP, Chicago, IL, United States) antibody for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was obtained from Novus Biologicals. all patients were informed about the study and gave verbal informed consent prior to enrollment. selected based on the following criteria from the patients who had been referred to Namazi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran) IHC was performed by means of detecting antigens with corresponding primary antibodies followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies. sections were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (Sigma, H9627), dehydrated and mounted with Permount. images were captured using a leica CTRMIC 6000 confocal microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C910013 spinning disc camera. semi-quantitative scoring was used to assess positive staining for LC3 protein expression in TMAs according to the method described previously[28]. the H-score was calculated by a semi-quantitative assessment of both staining intensity (scale 0-3) and the percentage of positive cells (0%-100%) the intensity score was made on the basis of the average intensity of staining where 0 = negative, 1 = weak, 2 = intermediate and 3 = strong. liver disease in hepatitis B and C virus infected patients Grade None Mild Moderate Severe HBV (n) 5 5 0 0 HCV (n) 3 5 1 1 HBV: Hepatitis C virus. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software for Windows (Version 16 SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, United States) different HBV- and HCV-infected liver tissues and LC3 expression was confirmed in all samples (Figure 1C and D) it has been previously shown that lipidated LC3 serves as a reliable marker of autophagy in ICC and IHC[5,29-31]. hepatitis B virus (HBV) and punctate LC3 in the HCV infected liver tissue. image is representative of fluorescence IHC for all patients.

HCV infection significantly induces autophagy in the infected hepatocytes compared to non-infected adjacent cells. a total of 40 samples were analyzed. a total of 40 samples were analyzed. the bar graphs show expression levels (H-score) of LC3 in HBVPos and HBVNeg liver tissue microarrays. the bars represent the mean SEM. aP 0.001 vs the normal HBVNeg. the graph shows results of the event (HBV infection and cleaved caspase-3) in at least 50 cells counted in four different microscopic fields from each patient\u2019s sample. HBV and HCV infection induce UPR in human liver tissue UPR induces expression of genes encoding proteins, such as BIP, to restore ER homeostasis[29,34]. the image is representative of fluorescence IHC for all patients. the event,HBV infection and BIP (GRP78) expression in at least 50 cells counted in four different views of fluorescence IHC in each patient\u2019s sample. fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirms co-localization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and spliced XBP (spliced XBP) (spliced XBP localized in the nucleus) in the infected hepatocytes compared to non-infected adjacent cells. autophagy, apoptosis, and UPR do not correlate with the stage and the grade of the liver disease in both HBV and HCV patients. DISCUSSION In this study we showed that HBV or HCV infection can significantly induce apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR in infected human patients compared to non-infected adjacent cells. HBx is the smallest protein encoded by HBV genome. it is expressed in 70% of patients with HBV-related HCC[44,45]. it is highly conserved in mammalian hepadnaviruses and essential for infection in mammals. a subgenomic replicon, corresponding to the HCV NS3-NS5B coding region of HCV genotype 1b, can trigger autophagy[68] which implies autophagy induction via viral nonstructural proteins. in addition, siRNA-targeting ATGs, that inhibit autophagy, abrogates HCV replication[69], being able to trigger autophagy[71]. a number of viruses use UPR to help attenuate anti-viral responses and establishment of infection[78,77]. a number of viruses use UPR to help attenuate anti-viral responses and establishment of infection[78-82]. there is general agreement on the induction of ER stress by HCV infection which can interfere with the ER function in host cells. HBx downregulates the cellular ATP level and mitochondrial membrane potential. then ATP reduction induces ER stress. HBx and S proteins both can activate the IRE1/XBP1 branch of the UPR. HBx is able to interact with the bZIP class of transcription factors. HBx might be involved in the expression and persistence of HBV. the ATF6 pathway associates with ER chaperone expression and helps the unfolded proteins to refold. COMMENTS Background Hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has emerged as a major public health problem in the world. apoptosis, autophagy and the unfolded protein response (UPR) have been implicated in a wide spectrum of human diseases including viral infection. apoptosis, autophagy and the unfolded protein response have been implicated in a wide spectrum of human diseases including viral infection. these pathways are tightly interconnected and their crosstalk is a key factor for cell-fate determination in response to different stimuli. however, their interplay during HBV and HCV infection remains unclear."}
