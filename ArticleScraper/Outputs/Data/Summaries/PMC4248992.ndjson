{"summary": "coronaviruses cause severe respiratory tract infection with a high mortality rate (2\u20135). a wide range of other coronaviruses have also been detected in bats, including SARS-like CoVs. they are likely the animal reservoir precursor strains that caused the SARS human epidemic (6\u201311) human nAbs developed as potential therapeutics for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS mainly targeted the RBD (18, 22\u201324, 27) studies have been conducted to assess anti-RBD nAbs for their breadth of protection against all relevant strains of SARS-CoV. a panel of human nAbs (11A, cs5, cs84, fm6, and fm39) were previously developed by de novo phage display library selection with GD03-RBD (11A), light-chain shuffling of 80R (cs5 and cs84), or focused mutagenesis of 80R (fm6 and fm39) these 80R derivative nAbs showed broader neutralization activity than parental 80R in two new nAbs can neutralize escape mutants. this particular epitope targeted by 80R is structurally flexible. a divergent combination approach of targeting the RBD-ACE2 interface epitope and a second different epitope may be more effective in providing broad neutralization and prevention of escape variants. titers were determined on vero E6 cells by plaque assay. fm6 escape mutant Urbani Y436H was produced for the pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. S-protein-pseudotyped lentivirus was produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with four plasmids. plasmid pCMVR8.2 encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol and pHIV-Luc encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene. nAbs were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 100 PFU of different icSARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate with 5 105 Vero E6 cells/well in duplicate. mouse ACE2 (mACE2) protein was cloned in pcDNA3.1 and fused at the C-terminal portion with a His6-tagged protein. the protein was produced by transfection of 293F cells and purified by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) icGD03, or icGD03-MA were preincubated with 30 g of nAb in 100 l of medium at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then inoculated onto 106 Vero E6 cells. the development of cytopathic effect was monitored over 72 h, and progeny viruses were harvested. mice were euthanized with isoflurane, and one-quarter of each mouse lung was taken to determine the viral titer. tissue was thawed and homogenized with glass beads at 60 s at 6,000 rpm in a MagnaLyser (Roche) vero E6 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% Fetal clone II (HyClone, South Logan, UT) and 1 antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO2 incubator. titers of the stocks were determined on vero E6 cells by plaque assay as previously described. phage-Abs were incubated with an adequate amount of S-protein-pseudotyped viruses for 30 min at room temperature and then added to a 96-well plate with 1 104 hACE2-expressing 293T cells/well. phage-Abs were incubated with an adequate amount of S-protein-pseudotyped viruses. Neutralizing titers were determined by either a microneutralization assay or a plaque reduction neutralization titer assay (42). for the microneutralization assay, nAbs were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 100 PFU of the different icSARS-CoV infectious clone strains for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. mutants fused C terminally with an Fc tag of human IgG1. ACE2 protein corresponding to its N-terminal extracellular domain (aa 19 to 615) was cloned in pcDNA3.1 and fused at the C-terminal portion. the association rates (Ka), dissociation rate constants (Kd) and affinity constants (KD) were calculated using Biacore T100 evaluation software. all Ka, Kd, and KD values reported here represent the means and standard errors of at least two experiments. mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (1.3 mg/mouse) and xylazine (0.38 mg/mouse) for all viral challenges, mice were anesthetized with 105 PFU of icUrbani, icGD03, icGD03-MA, fm6 escape mutant (fm6-Esc), fm39-Esc, cs5-Esc, Y12- fm6 showed the best overall neutralization potency and breadth. fm6 showed the best overall neutralization potency and breadth. fm6 showed the best overall neutralization potency and breadth. 80R has been shown to significantly reduce virus titers in lungs of young mice that were infected with Urbani virus (37) this increased virulence may be responsible for the different effects of 80R seen in aged and young mice. we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that an 80R escape mutant virus rapidly emerged during this 2-day window. neutralization escape mutants generated in a previously reported study by the same panel of nAbs tested in panel B. in vitro experiments were performed with the Urbani isolate under the selection of 80R and its derivatives. the single-amino-acid changes associated with neutralization escape from cs84, fm6, and fm39 were D480Y, Y436H, and N479T, respectively. no mutant was generated in three independent experiments, indicating that once the virus undergoes its primary escape (D480G under the selection of 80R), further evolution is heavily restricted. fm6 can cross-neutralize all of the escape mutant viruses, except for the mutant selected by fm39. despite its broad neutralization potency, the occurrence of the Y436H escape mutant led us to identify new nAbs that could have even broader activity. Y112A neutralized all strains tested, including human strains. GD03-MA is a mouse-adapted strain encoding the 2004 human GD03 S protein with Y436H mutation in the RBD. fm6, Y12, and Y112A failed to prevent viral escape mutations. we asked if a convergent combination immunotherapy approach can prevent neutralization escape or seriously impact viral fitness. icUrbani-D480G mutant virus selected by 80R was no longer able to escape the neutralization of fm6. each Ka, Kd, and KD value represents the mean and standard error of two independent experiments run on Biacore. in vitro growth characteristics of neutralization escape mutant SARS-CoV. all mice were inoculated with 105 PFU of viruses. mutations occurred at positions at the RBD-hACE2 interface (48) but did not change binding affinity (KD) and kinetics to hACE2 except Y12's escape mutation (Y442S), which had an 6-fold-slower Koff and an 5-fold-increased affinity. all viruses in vero E6 cells (expressing monkey ACE2) were delayed early in infection, as shown by a 1- to 2-log reduction in titer at 8 h after infection cs5-N479I mutant virus had a significant reduction in viral titer in the lungs. it is known that infection of murine cells with SARS-CoVs is inefficient. the binding affinity of the wild-type Urbani virus RBD to mACE2 was very low. 36H mutant viruses showed increased in vivo growth in young mice. a more than 2-log increase in viral titer in the lungs by day 4 after infection. in addition, mice infected with the Y12 escape mutant lost up to 15% of their weight by day 4 after infection. s of infected mice were monitored at different time points (5 mice per group) weight changes are expressed as the mean percent changes for infected animals relative to the initial weights at day 0.. fm6 showed the greatest cross-strain neutralization activity against multiple strains. 80R has been previously shown to significantly reduce virus titers in lungs of young mice that were infected with Urbani virus (37) this increased virulence may be responsible for the different effects of 80R seen in aged and young mice. this increased virulence may be responsible for the different effects of 80R seen in aged and young mice. in vitro neutralization escape mutants from 80R derivatives were performed with the Urbani isolate under the selection of 80R and its derivatives, cs5, cs84, fm6 and fm39. all mutants contained single-amino-acid changes within the RBD. cs84, fm6, and fm39 were D480Y, Y436H, and N479T. no mutant was generated in three independent experiments. evolution is heavily restricted and limits the virus's ability to evolve secondary escape mutations across this region. fm6 can cross-neutralize all of the escape mutant viruses, except for the mutant selected by fm39. despite its broad neutralization potency, the occurrence of the Y436H escape mutant led us to identify new nAbs that could have even broader activity. Plaque reduction assay confirmed broad neutralization activities of Y12 and Y112A against wild-type human strains Urbani and GD03, 80R neutralization-escape mutant virus (Urbani-D480G) and fm6 escape mutant (Urbani-Y436H) as well as a mouse-adapted strain, GD03-MA virus, which carries the GD03 S glycoprotein with a Y436H mutation in the RBD. fm6, Y12, and Y112A failed to prevent viral escape mutations. we asked if a convergent combination immunotherapy approach can prevent neutralization escape or seriously impact viral fitness. icUrbani-D480G mutant virus selected by 80R was no longer able to escape the neutralization of fm6. each Ka, Kd, and KD value represents the mean and standard error of two independent experiments run on Biacore. dotted line indicates the lowest detectable virus titer. monkey ACE2 of vero E6 (genBank accession no. AY996037.1) has 94.5% amino acid sequence identity to hACE2. cs5-N479I and fm39-N479T mutant viruses were attenuated. biacore analysis found that the binding affinity of the wild-type Urbani virus RBD to mACE2 was very low (estimated to be lower than 20 M, hundreds of folds less than that to hACE2). the binding affinity of the wild-type Urbani virus RBD to mACE2 was very low (estimated to be lower than 20 M, hundreds of folds less than that to hACE2). a more than 2-log increase in viral titer in the lungs by day 4 after infection compared with GD03-Y436H. mice infected with the Y12 escape mutant lost up to 15% of their weight by day 4 after infection, significantly higher than mice infected with GD03-Y436H. a dotted line indicates the lowest detectable virus titer. fm6 is the most potent nAb with the broadest neutralization activity in vitro. two new nAbs, Y12 and Y112A, were developed against the Y436H mutant. however, they did not block the emergence of new escape mutants to these nAbs. fm6 neutralization escape mutation, Y436H, is associated with the adaptation of a mouse adapted MA15 virus (52) of the six mutations of the MA15 genome that confer lethality in young mice, only the Y436H mutation is in the S protein. the escape mutant, Urbani-Y436H, showed no adaptation benefit but rather a slight attenuation in aged mice. mice infected with this mutant virus showed up to 15% weight loss. this mutant is significantly more virulent than GD03-MA virus. Y442L change mediates higher-affinity mouse ACE2 binding. this Y442L change has also been reported to be associated with increased virulence in mice. a divergent combination immunotherapy approach of using nAbs targeting different neutralizing epitopes is likely to be superior over CCI. a divergent combination immunotherapy approach of using a combination of nAbs targeting different neutralizing epitopes is likely to be superior over CCI to provide broader protection. the S2 domain of SARS-CoV may be an ideal target for developing nAbs with greater breadth, potency of neutralization, and resistance to neutralization escape. such nAbs can be used alone or as part of a DCI approach."}
