{"summary": "cAMP is a universal second messenger that tightly regulates a diverse array of physiological processes. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) [10,11] and cyclic nucleotide-activated channels, e.g., hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels (HCN) and cyclic nucleotide receptor involved in sperm function (CRIS) EPAC regulates several critical cAMP-related signaling pathways. this includes cardiac calcium homeostasis, vascular remodeling, tissue homeostasis, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, insulin secretion from pancreatic cells, integrin-dependent cell adhesion, neuronal excitability and memory consolidation. several EPAC-specific modulators have been screened to target EPAC proteins (vide infra) the phenomenon of non-specific enzyme inhibition is typically referred to as aggregation-prone inhibition (ABI) many of the aforementioned EPAC inhibitors have shown great therapeutic potential in cell-based and in vivo models despite their propensity to form colloidal aggregates. uation is crucial to carefully define and consider the false positive vs. false negative balance. we hope to provide key biophysical insight to the EPAC community in evaluating the inhibitory potential of current commercially available aggregation-prone EPAC inhibitors. cAMP-dependent activation depends on the relative conformation of the conserved N-terminal regulatory region (RR) to the C-terminal catalytic region (CR), effectively inhibiting EPAC GEF activity. cAMP-binding to the conserved CBD of the RR acts as a molecular switch, allowing EPAC to assume an open topology. substrate is represented by a green circle bound to the CD25 homology domain (colored dark grey), which is responsible for EPAC\u2019s GEF activity. cAMP-B is dispensable in the regulation of EPAC\u2019s catalytic activity in response to cellular cAMP levels. phosphate-binding cassette and hinge helix are labelled PBC and H respectively. no indication of the relative conformation of the PBC and hinge helix is reported in the diagram. however, the relative conformation of the PBC and hinge helix remains unknown. in the absence of cAMP, the PBC shifts \u201coutward\u201d to maintain a crucial hydrophobic contact between conserved Leucine in the PBC and a Phenylalanine in the hinge helix. the region C-terminal to the hinge helix, also known as the \u201clid\u201d, moves forcing the RR to occlude the Rap-binding site of the CR\u2019s CD25HD. two ubiquitously expressed cAMP-dependent sensors, EPAC and PKA, necessitate the development of selective pharmacological interventions to modulate their discrete functions. cyclic nucleotide analogues often interfere with phosphodiesterase activities, which increases cellular cyclic nucleotide levels. in 2012, a major breakthrough in developing EPAC-specific small molecule inhibitors was reported with the development of a robust EPAC-based high-throughput screen CE3F4 inhibits EPAC in an uncompetitive fashion [62] Unlike ESI-09, a competitive inhibitor, CE3F4 exists as interconverting rotamers, which populate an inseparable 3:1 E:Z mixture. crystallography studies revealed that the minor rotamer exhibits better packing [63]. CE3F4R Classical uncompetitive inhibitors specifically target the enzyme-substrate complex as opposed to the free enzyme, thus there is no binding competition with the substrate [69,70]. Increasing substrate concentration amplifies the effectiveness of the inhibitor, and sole recognition of the enzyme:substrate complex instead of the free enzyme increases the selectivity of binding relative to competitive inhibitors. holo inactive and hinge helix have not yet been elucidated in the holo, inactive and apo, active states. holo inactive intermediate is a type-A inhibitor, forming inert aggregates that do not interact directly with the protein. however, they reduce overall inhibitory effect by acting as sinks for monomeric inhibitors. x values report on the extent to which each residue in the EPAC1:cAMP:CE3F4R ternary complex resembles the inactive apo CBD (X = 1) vs. the active CBD:cAMP complex (X = 0) a five-fold increase in CE3F4R binding affinity was observed for the mutant. the binding of Rp-cAMPS reverts the enzyme completely to its apo, inactive state, effectively destabilizing the mixed intermediate. this mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition involves stabilizing a mixed intermediate of PKG by cAMP. the residues with significantly higher STD/STR ratios were consistent with those that exhibited the highest degree of non-linearity in the CHESPA analysis. the specific CE3F4R binding site was independently confirmed [45] by probing the / subdomain interface. CE3F4R is a promising candidate for therapeutic applications due to its uncompetitive inhibition mechanism and selectivity for EPAC1. this property may limit the maximum CE3F4R concentration used in therapeutic applications and increases susceptibility to non-specific effects such as aggregation-based inhibition. establishing that CE3F4R formed large, colloidal aggregates at micromolar concentrations, Boulton et al. also determined the mechanism of CE3F4R\u2019s ABI and its non-specific interactions with EPAC1. compared to the commonly observed ABI phenomenon where the protein receptor is non-specifically adsorbed onto the aggregate surface, CE3F4R aggregates did not interact directly with EPAC1. a bell-shaped bi-modal dose response curve is expected for type-A inhibitors. aggregation-based inhibition involves the coupling of specific binding and aggregation equilibria. the key determinants of this interaction are the Kd of the specific enzyme:inhibitor interaction and the CAC. ESI-09 is a competitive inhibitor that interacts specifically and selectively with EPAC. ESI-09 is a type-B inhibitor, forming invasive aggregates that non-specifically adsorb protein molecules and may subsequently decrease specific enzyme:ESI-binding by causing protein misfolding. the competitive nature of EPAC inhibition by ESI-09 was then independently confirmed using a competition assay. increasing cAMP concentration was found to completely reverse ESI-09\u2019s inhibitory effect, consistent with competitive inhibition. however, increasing ESI-09 inhibitor concentrations beyond 500 M resulted in line-broadening of almost every HSQC peak beyond detection. the mechanism of non-specific EPAC inhibition by ESI-09 was also determined by using biomolecular NMR techniques. ESI-09 formed submicrometer aggregates in aqueous buffers with a size range from 90\u2013600 nm. however, ESI-09 aggregates displayed a more regular, circular morphology. ESI-09 concentration was increased well above the CAC, indicating that EPAC1CBD interacts with ESI-09 aggregates. this finding was corroborated by comparing the size profile of EPAC1CBD with the addition of ESI-09 below and above its CAC. compared through DLS the size profile of EPAC1CBD with the addition of ESI-09. an ESI-09 concentration greater than 200 M is needed, which is greater than the CAC value. however, in in vivo studies, ESI-09 effectively ameliorates pathological conditions and exhibits excellent bioavailability with minimal toxicity at concentrations less than 20 M. the hydrophobic core of TX micelles may recruit and sequester free, hydrophobic inhibitors. if TX concentrations do not exceed its critical micellar concentration, there is the possibility that it will co-aggregate with hydrophobic compounds and limit their ability to interact with their intended targets. however, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of ABI attenuation by TX and HSA. interactions between TX and the ESIs were studied at various concentrations of both species. at concentrations significantly below the CMC for TX and CAC for CE3F4R and ESI-09, the formyl moiety of CE3F4R was found to interact with TX, facilitating the formation large co-aggregates. however, the size and morphology of the CE3F4R:TX co-aggregate population was distinct. the protective effect of TX was measured in preventing the recruitment of EPAC1CBD to ESI-09 aggregates at TX concentrations greater than its CMC and ESI-09 concentrations above its CAC [47] NH-HSQC intensity losses were still observed despite the addition of TX. however, using NMR approaches, the incorporation of TX into ESI-09 aggregates was observed. invasive type-B inhibitor aggregates non-specifically adsorb protein molecules. HSA directly binds monomeric inhibitors, decreasing free inhibitor concentration. TX binds ESI aggregates, forming heterogeneous co-aggregates. the ESIs bind HSA with affinities that are significantly greater than those for EPAC. ESI-09 has higher affinity for HSA than for EPAC1CBD. the use of HSA may have major implications in assays, increasing the likelihood of false negatives. CE3F4R binding captures EPAC1 in its holo, inactive conformation and stabilizes its closed topology, effectively inhibiting the enzyme. the specific binding site for CE3F4R is the / subdomain interface in the EPAC cAMP-binding domain, which becomes available upon cAMP binding. further studies should aim to define an in vivo therapeutic window for CE3F4R action. both CE3F4R and ESI-09 display aggregation in aqueous systems. the inhibitor may not be ideal for biological or pharmacological applications in aqueous systems. the inhibitor may not be ideal for biological or pharmacological applications. both TX and HSA attenuate non-specific enzyme:inhibitor interactions by competing with specific enzyme:inhibitor interactions. as a result, the attenuators can introduce false negatives in drug screens, discounting potentially viable drug leads. this review provides mechanistic insight that applies to other ESIs as well."}
