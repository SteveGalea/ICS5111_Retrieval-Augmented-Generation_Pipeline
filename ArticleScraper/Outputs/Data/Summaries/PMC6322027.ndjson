{"summary": "cilia must contain specific numbers of MCCs per tissue area and numbers of cilia per cell. each cilium must possess the correct ultrastructure, and beat in the right direction, at the optimum frequency, and with the appropriate waveform. mucus transport rates in small and large airways could overwhelm capacity for mucus elimination. nascent MCCs launch an MCC-specific gene expression program. the program prompts the assembly of 200\u2013300 basal bodies. basal bodies traffic to the apical cell membrane, dock, and elongate a microtubule-based motile ciliary axoneme. apical cytoskeleton is polarized via noncanonical Wnt signaling. this coordinates MCC directionality at the tissue level with distal-to-proximal (lung-to-mouth) anatomic regions. airway mucus is chiefly made of hydrated gel-forming mucin macromolecules. polymeric mucins are the chief macromolecules in airway mucus. these are the chief macromolecules in airway mucus, and are hence critical regulators of mucus functions. these mucin isoforms have distinct effects in the lungs. two polymeric mucin genes, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are expressed by airway surface and glandular epithelia. translation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where CTCK (C-terminal cysteine knot) regions of MUC5AC and MUC5B form interchain homodimers. mucins are extraordinarily large glycopolymers with viscous and elastic potentials. depolymerizing mucus is a goal for mucolytic therapy, but the field is limited by a lack of safe, tolerable, efficacious options. effective agents could \u201crescue\u201d mucociliary transport (MCT) and airflow functions. galactosamine (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) glycans are then added singly or in combinations that form core structures. cores are then further elaborated with Gal and GlcNAc extensions to form linear and branched structures. these heterogeneous structures impart unique physical properties on mucins. glycans carried by MUC5AC and MUC5B have evolved to serve specific critical specialized functions based on host genetics, environmental stimuli, and anatomical location. using animal models with gain- and loss-of-function genetic interventions, we have been able to assess significance and some important degrees of physiologic functions. the platform reproduces unidirectional mucus transport and enables thorough analyses on high-resolution characterization of CBF per cilium, per cell, per field of view, per chip, per donor, and per condition. the platform also permits mapping the ranges of CBF values in different experimental settings. this allows for variability in CBF among different cells and conditions to be quantified. new therapeutics could include means for both the prevention and reversal of mucin hypersecretion and mucociliary dysfunction. new therapies could include means for both the prevention and reversal of mucin hypersecretion and mucociliary dysfunction."}
