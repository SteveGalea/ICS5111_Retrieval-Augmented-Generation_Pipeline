{"summary": "infection is a common complication after lung transplantation, its recognition may be difficult, and signs and symptoms may sometimes be misleading. recipients can host infections from a wide range of microorganisms. lung grafts could promote the transmission of infections from donors. pneumonia is the most common form of infection after lung transplantation. chest computed tomography (CT) is a useful instrument for the diagnosis of most of these disorders. ground glass opacities with scattered micronodules, bronchiectasis and consolidations are the most common CT findings in viral infections. patients with other indications for transplantation should be carefully investigated for possible infectious diseases, even in latent form. bronchoalveolar lavage may provide information on bronchial flora to guide antibiotic therapy. mycobacterium abscessus complex, a group of rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), has emerged as a major problem, particularly in cystic fibrosis candidates for lung transplantation. the diagnosis of non-tuberculous mycobacterium disease must include radiological signs and positive culture from bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy or at least two separated expectorated sputum samples. cal vaccinations are among the uncommon immunizations that should be implemented. monitoring of immunization to vaccine-preventable infections before transplantation is quite common among transplantation centers. influenza vaccination is highly recommended both before and after transplantation. ceftazidime is considered the first choice; administration should begin before incision. vancomycin should be started before incision; administration should continue twice a day for 48\u201372 hours. if postoperative course presents complications, antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued and eventually adapted to identified pathogens. antifungal prophylaxis Lung transplant recipients have a higher risk of fungal infections than other solid-organ recipients. aspergillus is the most frequent pathogen in lung transplantation whereas Candida is the leading pathogen in other solid-organ transplants. systemic administration of voriconazole or posaconazole is the most rational strategy for universal prophylaxis. hepatotoxicity and drug interactions should be carefully monitored. the duration of such prophylaxis is also heterogeneous among centers. the lung has been identified as a major site of CMV latency and recurrence. lung transplantation is associated with the transfer of a larger CMV load than other solid organs, increasing the risk of CMV infection and disease. serology should be performed before transplantation on both the organ donor (D) and the recipient (R) serostatus is a key predictor of infection risk and management. seronegative recipients of seropositive organs (D+/R) having the highest risk, D+/R+ and D/R+ intermediate risk, D/R the lowest risk. the AST guidelines recommend 12 months of prophylaxis among CMV D+/R lung transplant recipients and 6 to 12 months for CMV D+/R+ and D/R+ lung transplant recipients. prophylactic treatment should start with intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg once daily, with dose adjustment for renal insufficiency. intravenous ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir should be administered twice daily. valganciclovir has been shown non-inferior to intravenous ganciclovir in non-life threating CMV disease. in severe and/or invasive disease, IV ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 hours) is preferable. the lung has been identified as a major site of CMV latency and recurrence. lung transplantation is associated with the transfer of a larger CMV load than other solid organs, increasing the risk of CMV infection and disease in these recipients. viral load testing is the cornerstone for diagnosis and monitoring for CMV infection and disease. the diagnosis of tissue-invasive CMV disease should be confirmed by immunohistochemistry or in situ DNA hybridization. the most common mutations affect UL97 phosphotransferase and confer resistance to ganciclovir. oral valganciclovir is initiated when viral replication has reached a certain threshold. a pre-emptive strategy may be useful after the prophylaxis has ended. no effective vaccination is yet available for CMV. in severe and/or invasive disease, IV ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 hours) is preferable. the efficacy of antiviral treatment can be augmented by reducing the intensity of immunosuppression (21) and/or with administration of CMV immune globulin (limited evidence) the development of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) has provided a major breakthrough in the treatment and prevention of influenza infection. the development of zanamivir and zanamivir has provided a major breakthrough in the treatment and prevention of influenza infection. treatment Adenovirus Supportive treatment Coronavirus Supportive treatment Bocavirus Supportive treatment 34 studies on CARV infections in lung transplant recipients failed to detect any association between viral infections and acute rejection. data is as yet insufficient to accept or refute the association between viral infections and the development of chronic rejection. 34 studies on CARV infections in lung transplant recipients failed to detect any association between viral infections and acute rejection. data is as yet insufficient to accept or refute the association between CARV infections and the development of chronic rejection. the rate of PTLD in lung transplant recipients may range between 5% and 15% (38). some transplant centers apply prophylactic antiviral treatment consisting of acyclovir or ganciclovir in high risk patients for primary EBV infection following surgery (EBV donor+, recipient EBV) pre-transplant evaluation of recipient VZV immune status is highly advisable. it is suggested that non-immune recipients undergo VZV vaccination prior to transplantation. treatment of both post-transplant primary VZV infection and HZ reactivation should be managed with currently available antiviral agents. administration of oral acyclovir in this setting may be useful to prevent HZ reactivation. there is no demonstration that administration of oral acyclovir in this setting may be useful to prevent HZ reactivation. however, in HZV seronegative lung transplant recipients, prophylaxis is recommended. aspergillus spp. is the most common cause of fungal infection in lung transplant recipients. the predominant pathogens are Aspergillus spp., Candida species, Cryptococcus spp. and the agents of mucormycosis. invasive aspergillosis is defined by invasion of lung parenchyma. it generally presents with non-specific symptoms (pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis) it may be enhanced by several risk factors, such as allograft dysfunction, immunosuppression levels, single lung transplant, environmental exposure, colonisation. invasive disease requires systemic therapy with voriconazole for at least 3 months. debridement of the bronchial anastomosis may be indicated in case of abundant necrotic tissue. echinocandin is the treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis. Scedosporium spp. is a hyaline mold found in the environment, with two species capable of causing disease in humans: S. apiospermum and S. prolificans. most common manifestations are invasive pulmonary infection and disseminated disease. aspergillus tracheobronchitis is seen only in lung transplant recipients. it is the most common form of aspergillus infection after this transplant. it usually affects the bronchial anastomosis (46), causing productive cough, dyspnoea, fever, stridor/wheeze, haemoptysis. mucormycosis is characterized by infarction and necrosis of host tissues that result from invasion of the vasculature by fungal hyphae. the overall mortality is very high, ranging from 49% to 90%. intravenous administration of amphotericin B is the cornerstone of therapy in these cases. most common manifestations are invasive pulmonary infection and disseminated disease. most common manifestations are invasive pulmonary infection and disseminated disease. other Fusarium is ubiquitous and is notorious plant pathogen. mortality rates for post-transplant TB are in the order of 20\u201330%, with an attributable mortality of 10% (56,58). clinical presentation of active TB generally involves systemic signs and symptoms in conjunction with respiratory symptoms, as the lung is by far the most commonly involved site. the currently proposed treatment regimens for drug-susceptible tuberculosis are presented in Table 3. a reduction of immunosuppressive treatment is often suggested, particularly during the early stages of treatment. discontinuations due to drug induced toxicity are common even in the immunocompetent host. discontinuations due to drug induced toxicity are common even in the immunocompetent host. considerable increases in the doses of calcineurin inhibitors may be required (up to 3\u20135 fold) multidrug-resistant TB is defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampin. extremely drug-resistant TB is defined as resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones and at least one injectable drug (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin) there is considerable country-to-country variation in the rates of both forms of resistance. 12% of cystic fibrosis patients present a positive NTM culture prior to transplantation. 12% of cystic fibrosis patients present a positive culture prior to transplantation. ation is an issue in cystic fibrosis patients, and in COPD patients who undergo single lung transplantation. it is thought that transplant recipients may be at higher risk of acquiring nosocomial NTM infections from contaminated water supplies. pulmonary involvement may present as nodules, pulmonary infiltrates and abscesses. M. abscessus complex (MABSC) includes three closely related species of NTM: M. abscessus sensu stricto (referred to as M. abscessus), M. massiliense, and M. bolletii (71) the latter is relatively uncommon accounting for roughly 10% of isolates. drug toxicity may be a significant problem due to the multi drug treatment regimens and length of treatment. in addition to medical therapy, surgical excision and reduction of immunosuppressive levels may be considered. two parenteral agents Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily Tigecycline 100 mg loading dose then 50 mg once or twice daily. ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 960 mg twice daily, or imipenem 1 g twice daily. solid organ transplant recipients overall are at an increased risk of post-transplant TB compared to the general population (55). this risk is highest in the subgroup of patients undergoing lung transplantation. over 90% of TB cases develop within the first year following transplantation, and roughly three quarters involve the lungs (56,58). sensitivity testing is obtained, and a continuation phase so as to complete 6 months of treatment (59). the most effective regimen requires daily dosing throughout the entire treatment course. alternative regimens including combinations with twice weekly or 3 times weekly drug intake are acceptable. INH 15 mg/kg (gen. 900 mg) 3 times weekly for 8 weeks 15 mg/kg (gen. 600 mg) 3 times weekly for 18 weeks RIF 10 mg/kg (gen. 600 mg) 10 mg/kg (gen. 600 mg) PZA 40\u201355 kg, 1,500 mg; 56\u201375 kg,

drug-resistant (XDR) TB is defined as resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones and at least one injectable drug (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin) treatment regimens for lung transplant recipients that develop active TB are based on the same drugs employed for MTB infection in the immunocompetent host. treatment involves two phases: an intensive phase consisting of four drugs to be continued for 2 months or until antibiotic sensitivity testing is obtained. the most effective regimen requires daily dosing throughout the entire treatment course; although alternative regimens including combinations with twice weekly or 3 times weekly drug intake are acceptable. mg \u2013 ETB 40\u201355 kg, 800 mg; 56\u201375 kg, 1,200 mg; 76\u201390 kg, 1,600 mg \u2013 INH 5 mg/kg

900 mg) discontinuations due to drug induced toxicity are common even in the immunocompetent host. rifampin induces hepatic enzymatic activity that promotes more rapid metabolism of immunosuppressive drugs. considerable increases in doses of calcineurin inhibitors may be required. eastern european countries show alarmingly high rates of both forms of resistance. there is limited consensus on the optimal management of drug resistance TB in immunocompetent hosts. only a limited number of such MDR or XDR cases have been reported following lung transplantation. 12% of cystic fibrosis patients present positive NTM culture prior to transplantation. infection generally occurs at a considerable time distance from transplantation. pulmonary involvement is more common, but not exclusive. ary involvement may present as nodules, pulmonary infiltrates, abscesses and cavitating nodules. respiratory symptoms may include chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea and occasionally, hemoptysis. pre-transplant culturing of M. abscessus has become a growing concern in deciding eligibility for transplantation. abscessus due to absence of erythromycin ribosomal methylase gene erm (41), which encodes for inducible clarithromycin resistance (72). pre-transplant infection with M. massiliense is more likely to clear following transplantation compared to M. abscessus (73). cin 10\u201330 mg/kg

tigcycline 100 mg loading dose then 50 mg once or twice daily, or imipenem 1 g twice daily. treatment of NTM infection is based on the same basic principles that guide management of MTB infection. drug toxicity may be a significant problem due to the multi drug treatment regimens and length of treatment. pulmonary and disseminated disease treatment should be prescribed for 12 months following culture negativity. 100 mg twice daily M. haemophilum Azithromycin 500 mg twice daily (max. 600 mg) or azithromycin 500 mg twice daily Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

system) it can be acquired by inhalation, direct inoculation and/or ingestion. individualised treatment is however common based on antimicrobial sensibility testing. development of drug toxicity may dictate antimicrobial substitution during therapy. standard regimens in immunocompromised hosts suggest 6\u201312 months of treatment. long term co-trimoxazole has been used as secondary prophylaxis following nocardia infection (79) there is no consensus on optimal dosing regimens. treatment of nocardial infections following lung transplantation is often based on combination of more than one antimicrobial agent. most lung transplant recipients receive prolonged Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole. co-trimoxazole has been used as secondary prophylaxis following nocardia infection (79) toxin A and toxin B trigger a cytotoxic response, neutrophilic infiltrate and cytokine release. infection is a common problem in lung transplant recipients, with an estimated incidence of 7\u201331% (81). symptoms include prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay. in transplanted patients PCP progresses to severe inflammatory pneumonia with respiratory failure and death. the widespread use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim prophylaxis has now dramatically reduced infection rates to 0.3\u20132.6%. immunofluorescent microscopic visualization of Pneumocystis in bronchoalveolar lavage is the standard method for the laboratory diagnosis of PCP. a consistent number of patients without Pneumocystis identification on the microscopic smear are effectively affected by PCP. agent Dose
