{"summary": "virions isolated from early infected individuals harbor complex viral populations within their bloodstreams. this appears to be true for transmission mediated by all modes, including sexual transmission, mother-to-child transmission, and intravenous infection via needle sharing [1\u20139]. the virus populations in newly infected individuals often start off as genetically homogenous and match a strong consensus sequence. the most rapidly evolving residues in CD4 fall at the interaction interface with the HIV-1 surface protein Envelope (Env) the most rapidly evolving residues in CD4 fall at the interaction interface with the HIV-1 surface protein Envelope (Env) stably expressing human CCR5 and indicated CD4 receptors (x-axis) were infected with Q23Env-GFP pseudotyped with BG505 Env, isolated from a newly infected infant. the percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. the compatibility of early HIV-1 isolates with primate CD4 receptors has not been explored. we cloned the CD4 genes of 15 primate species, plus human CD4. expression levels of these CD4 receptors on Cf2Th cells were similar to endogenous expression levels of CD4 seen on human immortalized T cells. the overbaugh group amplified BG505 Env from an infant approximately 6 weeks after delivery. this indicated that the infection probably started from a single virion and that the captured Env sequence closely resembles the Env of this transmitted virion. the alternate folding conformations of BG505 Env have been solved in complex with CD4. d monkey, colobus, and owl monkey behave similarly to human CD4. chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and sooty mangabey encode CD4 receptors that support entry of this virus but at a level that is approximately 2-fold lower than human CD4. a third class of species encodes CD4 receptors that support entry at a level 25-fold or more reduced compared to human CD4. owl monkey populations circulate CD4 alleles that are both non-functional (39I) and functional (39N) for HIV-1 entry. the selective use of primate CD4 receptors is a property of HIV-1 from the bloodstream. all of these receptors were partially or highly defective for entry mediated by BG505 Env. two of the four Envs demonstrated the specific use of human CD4. the other two demonstrated a weakening of this selective CD4 phenotype but still a preference for human CD4. the percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with two to three technical replicates. to address this further, we looked at how CD4 receptor usage may change over time as infection progresses from early- to late-stage of disease. selective use of primate CD4 receptors appears to describe many HIV-1 isolates from the blood, including those isolated just after infection (weeks), later at 6 months (Fig 2B), or even during chronic stages of infection (Fig 2A). matched donor\u2013recipient HIV-1 Env pairs showed selective use of human CD4. macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates are promiscuous in their use of primate CD4 receptors. cells stably expressing various primate CD4 receptors were infected with Q23Env-GFP pseudotyped with (A) early HIV-1 Envelopes (Envs) or (B) Envs from common macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates. soluble CD4 neutralization assays are shown within each panel. the mean and SD values reflect the variation of the IC50 calculations from two independent experiments. chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 instead of human sCD4. the median relative infection for all early HIV-1 Envs was significantly lower than macrophage-tropic Envs (Fig 3A; P 0.05; Mann\u2013Whitney U test) the median relative infection for all early HIV-1 Envs was significantly lower than macrophage-tropic Envs (Fig 3B; P 0.05; Mann\u2013Whitney U test) the IC50 values are approximately 4-fold higher for early Envs than for macrophage-tropic Envs. the broadened ability to enter cells through the CD4 receptors encoded by all primates tested correlate with tighter CD4 binding. chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 tested the ability of these proteins to neutralize different classes of HIV-1. both mutations were originally characterized because they increase entry via macaque CD4 [77,78], while the S375Y mutation resulted in a more substantial increase. both mutations also improve entry via all of the primate CD4 receptors tested, with increasing improvement as the binding affinity for CD4 increases. indicted Env was pseudotyped onto Q23Env-GFP. each of the three viruses was preincubated with increasing concentrations of human soluble CD4 (sCD4) and then used to infect TZM-bl cells. IC50 values are listed on each panel, for which the size of the error bar is less than the symbol size. these Envs were pseudotyped onto Q23Env-GFP and used to infect cells expressing the indicated CD4 and human CCR5. the percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected with human CD4. the early Envs mediated fusion most efficiently with cells expressing the indicated CD4. early isolates of HIV-1 from the blood are deficient in binding and/or fusion with CD4 from some primate species. early isolates of HIV-1 from the blood are deficient in binding and/or fusion with CD4 from some primate species. rhesus macaques (predominantly rhesus macaques) serve as the current animal model for HIV-1. we identified alleles encoding five unique CD4 protein variants. rhesus macaque CD4 alleles behaved identically and were nonfunctional for entry of virus pseudotyped with BG505 Env. a total of 33 Envs were tested from the following major HIV-1 subtypes: subtype A (n = 12), subtype B (n = 7), subtype C (n = 6), and subtype A/D (n = 2). the percentage of fusion was calculated relative to what was observed with human CD4/CCR5. we tested 29 additional Envs using the cell\u2013cell fusion assay described above. these Envs were universally poor at mediating fusion with cells expressing rhesus macaque CD4 and CCR5 proteins. almost no HIV-1 isolated from the bloodstream is compatible with macaque version of CD4. the overbaugh group amplified BG505 Env from an infant 6 weeks after delivery. this indicated that the infection probably started from a single virion. a cocrystal of BG505 Env has been solved in complex with CD4. all samples were narrowed to the same log decade of CD4 receptor expression (S1 Fig). the CD4 receptors of some species behave similarly to human CD4 when challenged with BG505 HIV-1. a third class encodes CD4 receptors that support entry at a level 25-fold or more reduced compared to human CD4. owl monkey populations circulate CD4 alleles that are both non-functional (39I) and functional (39N) for HIV-1 entry. owl monkey populations circulate CD4 alleles that are both non-functional (39I) and functional (39N) for HIV-1 entry. selective use of primate CD4 receptors is a property of HIV-1 from the bloodstream, including early HIV-1 isolates. from this point forward, we focused on CD4 receptors from a subset of primate species, in particular the African primate species involved in the zoonotic transmissions of HIV-1 (chimpanzees and gorillas) stably expressing human or primate CD4 receptors were infected with Q23Env-GFP bearing (A) chronic Envelopes (Envs) [49], (B) early (newly infected; grey bars) and chronic (6 months post infection; black bars) the percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the percent infected. infection mediated by all of these Envs was reduced in cells expressing chimpanzee or macaque CD4 receptors when compared to human CD4. selective use of primate CD4 receptors appears to describe many HIV-1 isolates from the blood, including those isolated just after infection (weeks), later at 6 months. human CD4 supported entry of all of these viruses, but primate CD4 orthologs supported levels of HIV-1 entry that ranged from 2- to 58-fold lower. macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates, which are known to bind human CD4 more tightly, are promiscuous in their use of primate CD4 receptors. TZM-bl cells are HeLa CD4/CCR5 cells that express luciferase in response to HIV-1 tat expression, read in relative light units (RLUs) Error bars represent the mean + SD from one biological replicate (n = 3 to 4 technical replicates) same as C and D, only neutralization assays were performed with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 instead of human sCD4. in contrast to the blood-derived isolates, macrophage-tropic viruses were promiscuous in their use of all CD4 receptors tested. for each primate CD4 tested, the median relative infection for all early HIV-1 Envs was significantly lower than macrophage-tropic Envs. to test this, we purified a soluble version of the human CD4 receptor. HIV-1 pseudotyped with either of two different early Envs was neutralized in a dose-dependent manner by human sCD4. the IC50 values are approximately 4-fold higher for early Envs than for macrophage-tropic Envs. the broadened ability to enter cells through the CD4 receptors encoded by all primates tested correlate with tighter CD4 binding. BG505 Env, the prototypic early Env discussed above, was engineered to have two different point mutations, one at position 281 and the other at position 375. these mutations have been previously shown to increase binding affinity to CD4, although only one has been characterized within the BG505 Env background. both mutations also improve entry via all primate CD4 receptors tested, with increasing improvement as the binding affinity for CD4 increases. an early Env engineered to have weak, medium, or tight binding to CD4 becomes more promiscuous in its use of primate CD4 receptors. an early Env engineered to have weak, medium, or tight binding to CD4 becomes more promiscuous in its use of primate CD4 receptors. values above error bars represent fold decrease relative to human CD4 for those samples that passed significance thresholds. chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 instead of human sCD4 were also introduced into the BG505 Env, which have also been shown to increase binding affinity for CD4. the early Envs mediated fusion most efficiently with cells expressing human CD4. the macrophage-tropic Envs broadly engaged and fused with diverse primate CD4 receptors. weak binding to CD4 is what makes most blood-derived HIV-1 isolates selective in their use of only certain primate CD4 receptors. macaques encode a CD4 receptor that is not permissive for entry of most blood-derived HIV-1 isolates. we sequenced the gene from 52 captive Indian-origin rhesus macaques and identified alleles encoding five unique CD4 protein variants. rhesus macaque CD4 alleles are universally defective for HIV-1 entry. unique alleles were cloned and further verified by Sanger sequencing. a total of 33 Envs were tested from the following major HIV-1 subtypes. the percentage of fusion was calculated relative to what was observed with human CD4/CCR5. nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acid; CCR5, C-C motif chemokine receptor 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein. nt, nucleotide; amino acid; nt, nucleotide; amino acid; CCR5, C-C motif chemokine receptor 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein. nt, nucleotide; amino acid; nt, nucleotide; amino acid; selective use of only certain primate CD4 receptors occurs when HIV-1 Env has weak binding affinity for CD4. the strongest evidence in favor of this model is that viruses that have been selected or engineered to have tight CD4 binding affinity become agnostic to sequence differences in the CD4 molecule. this underscores the need to further understand the significance of CD4 binding affinity to HIV biology. some of our current primate models use Envs that are engineered for tight CD4 binding affinity so that they more efficiently engage the nonpermissive macaque CD4 receptor. cellular tropism via high-affinity CD4 binding may be disadvantageous to the virus, disproportionately skewing infection toward a more diseased state. this has been a tremendously powerful tool in the HIV field, having led to the original identification of, and mechanistic insights into, many host factors that control HIV-1 biology. all cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. blood samples were obtained from animals housed at the Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (KCCMR) in Bastrop, TX.
