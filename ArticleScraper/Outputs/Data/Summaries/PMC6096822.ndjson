{"summary": "virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune responses most likely play a dominant role in determination of disease progression and outcome. the viral CTL response is minimal or undetectable in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with viral persistence and immune tolerance (2\u20134). HLA-associated polymorphisms in CHB have been observed on both anchor and non-anchor residues within epitopes that may lead to altered scores for binding to HLA molecules. however, several virus-specific CTL epitopes can be recognized by T cells in the context of a wide range of HLA alleles. mutations in immunodominant epitopes may simultaneously affect the function of viral proteins and subsequent viral replication (18, 19). 159 HBc sequences of genotype C from the NCBI were aligned. the amino acid variation cutoff was set as more than 10% difference. patients infected with HBV containing more variations in HBc exhibited much higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. 0.01 No. of HBV DNA (copies/ml) Mean 3.1 107 1.4 107 1.1 107 >0.05 Range 2,354 to 1.6 109 500 to 2.6 108 500 to 5.3 108 ALT (IU/liter) (means SD) 171.4 250.3 455.2 373.2 251.9 380.2 0.01 AST (IU/liter) (means SD) overlapping 9-mer peptide pool was used to screen potential HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes in HBc of genotypes B and C. four peptides had high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201 molecules. six- to 8-week-old HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice were inoculated with an HBV DNA prime/peptide boost regimen at weeks 1, 3 and 4. the splenocytes were sacrificed 1 week after the last immunization and the splenocytes were separated. 2.1/kb transgenic mice that were double positive for serum HBsAg/HBV DNA and HLA-A*0201 expression were immunized with an HBV DNA prime/peptide boost regimen. expression of HLA-A2 was determined by FACS in the liver and spleen of F1 hybrids. expression of HLA-A2 was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in the liver and spleen of F1 hybrids. this may be due to relatively low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in liver and high MHC expression in lymphocytes. reactivity was observed between the P130- and T130-specific T-cell responses. similar results were observed by cytotoxicity assays. refolded complexes were detected by size exclusion chromatography. the peaks of the HLA complexes with the expected molecular mass of 45 kDa were eluted at the estimated volume of 85 ml. mAU, milli-absorbance units. the overall structure of HLA-A*0201/P130 is similar to that of HLA-A*0201/T130. however, there are two major conformational shifts, aside from the mutated P8-Pro to P8-Thr, between the two structures. 72.006 c 60.295 123.788 90.0 90.0 96.9 90.0 90.0 90.0 Wavelength () 1.54178 1.00000 Resolution () 50.0\u20132.0 (2.07\u20132.0)a 50.0\u20131.70 (1.76\u20131.70) Total no. of reflections 197,729 381,837 Completenessb (%) 93.3 (99.3) 99.4 (100) Rmerge (%) 7.7 (36.1) 5.9(28.5) Refinement statistics PBMCs (2 105/well) isolated from HLA-A2-positive patients (n = 22) grouped as infected with wild-type (HBcP130, n = 13) or variant (HBcT130, n = 8) virus were stimulated with peptides P130, T130, HBc82-90, or HBc18-27. a total of 239 CHB patients and 146 ACLF patients were enrolled to investigate the clinical and virological features impacted by the HBc P130T mutation. the population size provided an adequate number of patients in each group for assessing the comparison of significance. a significantly higher HBc-specific CD8+ T-cell response was observed in patients infected with P130 virus than in those with T130 variants (SFCs, 62.0 25.9 versus 38.9 10.1; P 0.05) these results indicate that immune pressure by CTLs is related to mutation rate within the epitope. high background variation rates within these HLA-A2-restricted epitopes may be due to infection of the variants in the beginning. higher epitope mutation rate in HLA-A2-positive patients was only observed in immune-active CHB but not in tolerant CHB. 123 131 A2 GVWIRTPPA 139 148 A2 STLPETTVV 141 151 A1101, A68, A31 STLPETTVVRR FIG 5. Clinical association of substitutions within HLA-A2-restricted and A24-restricted epitopes of HBc in HBV-infected patients. three defined HLA-A24-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes in HBc were included for analysis. HLA-A24-positive patients infected with variants within the epitopes exhibited higher HBV DNA, ALT, and AST levels than those infected with wild-type isolates. only the information of HLA-A2 and -A24 typing are available for the patients, so they were divided by their HLA-A2 and -A24 alleles. it is possible that some variations within epitopes did not result in significant differences of clinical parameters. Pearson's 2 test was used to determine P values. position-related substitution bias of HLA-A*0201 epitopes. accumulated mutation rates were similar (8 to 19 substitutions per 1,000 sites) the solvent-exposed C-terminal portion of the epitopes has the highest mutation rate (65 substitutions/1,000 sites) of the analyzed positions. similar frequencies and patterns of sequence polymorphisms in the epitopes were observed between genotypes B and C. the structures of TCR/MHC/peptide A6 (1AO7) and JM22 (1OGA) were used for the modeling by the superimposition of HLA-A*0201. the TCR CDR3s of the TCRs largely dock over the solvent-exposed N-terminal part of the peptides. the TCR CDR3s hover over the solvent-exposed N-terminal part of the peptides. the impact of amino acid variants of another viral main structure protein, HBs, on disease severity was also explored. however, the correlation between HBs variation and disease severity was less evident. a systematic screening of the CD8+ T-cell epitopes on HBc was performed. 0.01 AST (IU/liter) (means SD) 113.9 131.8 285.9 267.1 274.1 396.0 0.01 a HBV, hepatitis B virus; CHB-M, mild chronic hepatitis B; CHB-S, severe chronic hepatitis B; ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure; M, male; F, female; HBeAg, hepatitis B e antigen; ALT, alanine four peptides had high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201 molecules. a fluorescence index (FI) value of >1.5 was used as a cutoff for further analysis. HBc P130T variation causes decreased antiviral activity of peptide-specific CTLs. splenocytes were harvested and stained with HLA-A*0201/P130, HLA-A*0201/T130, or HBc18-27 tetramer. fresh splenocytes from immunized mice were stimulated with P130, T130, HBc82-90, or HBc18-27 peptide to detect peptide-specific CTLs. the killing assay was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2D. the data show mean standard deviation from five mice. data are representative of three independent experiments with similar results. hepatocytes between HLA-A2 transgenic mice and HBV/HLA-A2 hybrid mice by a gene dosage effect were not as evident as that in splenocytes. HBsAg levels in P130- and T130-immunized mice significantly decreased. similar results were obtained in the quantification of serum HBV-DNA levels. the midpoint transition temperature of the well-refolded HLA-A*0201/P130 peptide (43\u00b0C) was moderately higher than that of HLA-A*0201/T130 (40\u00b0C) the different binding capacities of P130 and its mutant T130 were also shown in the T2 cell binding assay. the crystal structures of HLA-A*0201/P130 and T130 complexes were determined to 2.0- resolution. the names of conserved residues are shown in black, and P8-Pro in P130 and P8-Thr in T130 are denoted in purple and orange fonts. Detailed HLA I-peptide interaction analysis indicated that P6-Thr of P130 forms multiple hydrogen bonds within the HLA-A*0201 groove. the P6-Thr of P130 also interacts with Arg97 through a water molecule within the peptide binding groove. however, no hydrogen bonds can be found between the P6-Thr of P130 and the residues within the peptide binding groove. HBc P130T variation in HBV-infected patients is associated with severe hepatitis and disease progression. patients infected with wild-type HBV showed a significantly higher peptide-specific CTL response than patients infected with the HBc P130T variants. two hundred twenty-one CHB patients were divided into HLA-A2-positive (A2 pos) and -negative (A2 neg) groups infected with wild-type (P130) or variant (T130) HBV. serum levels of ALT (B), AST (C) and HBV DNA (D) were detected. 16.3% of patients had the HBc T130 variant (18/239 for other variants) the difference did not reach statistical significance. patients infected with HBc P130T variants exhibited significantly higher DNA loads (approximately 3-fold higher) than those with wild-type isolates. the impact of HLA-A2-associated HBc variation on HBV DNA levels was somewhat different between genotypes B and C, with a more efficient impact on genotype B. the prevalence of variations in HLA-A2-restricted epitopes increased with disease progression in HLA-A2-positive patients but not HLA-A2-negative patients. list of CD8 epitopes from HBc included in analysis Start position HLA Sequence 7 16 A0206 KEFGASVELL 11 27 A2, class II ATVELLSFLPSDFFPSV 18 27 A2 FLPADFFPSV 19 27 B5101, B3501, B0702 LPSDFFPSV 23 31 A24 FFPSIRDLL 30 38 A101 LLDTASALY 42 50 B41 LESPEHCSP 60 68 A2 VCWGELMNL 63 71 B Pearson's 2 test was used to determine P values. distribution of the rate of variation of HLA-A2-restricted HBc epitopes. the clinical relevance of hot variation sites with variation rates of 10% was analyzed. patients infected with variants at positions P5, L60, S87, and P135 had much higher HBV DNA loads than those infected with wild-type virus. variation rates of more than 10% were chosen as hot variations. the coverage of all published HLA class I-restricted epitopes in the Immune Epitope Database is indicated by red (HLA-A2 restricted) and black (not HLA-A2 restricted) sticks. two primary anchor residues insert into the B and F pockets of HLA-A2. a secondary anchor at P6 (9-mer peptide) or P7 (10-mer peptide) also protrude a side chain into the groove. the solvent-exposed middle portion of the peptides can be divided into two different parts by the secondary anchor in the median portion of the peptide. the structures of HBc18-27, HBc60-68, HBc123-131, and HBc141-149 epitopes available online are shown with sticks and spheres. to clearly show the anchors in the pockets, the 2 helices were deleted in side view. the high substitution frequency in position 7/8 in 9-mer epitopes or 8/9 in 10-mer epitopes causes immune evasion by avoiding T-cell recognition. previous studies showed that HBV preferably accumulates escape mutations within the highly expressed core proteins to reduce the number of epitopes (8, 9), and mutations in immune epitopes within the core gene were significantly correlated with higher stages of liver fibrosis and disease progression of CHB. the percentage of patients with viral epitope mutations among HLA-A2-positive CHB was higher than that among HLA-A2-negative CHB. this trend was only observed in immune-active CHB and not tolerant CHB. structural analysis reveals residue variation bias in the C-terminal portion of these four epitopes. tope HBc18-27, and P130T variation resulted in a significantly decreased antiviral T-cell response in mice and AHB. structural analysis indicated that P130T variation is not located in the anchor site, but it affects epitope conformational changes and its interaction with TCR. in addition, there may exist reciprocal interactions between P130T and other variations in HBc (21). the high substitution frequency in the solvent-exposed C terminus of the epitopes contributes to immune escape by disrupting T-cell recognition and generating CTL subtypes with low antiviral activity. the impact of epitope mutation on viral titers depends on its occurrence on different residue positions within epitopes or immunodominant epitopes. clinical information associated with HBc variations was analyzed based on the database of records for HBV-infected patients built by the Beijing 302 Hospital (Beijing, China) the criteria for diagnosis of CHB and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) complied with the management scheme of diagnostic and therapy of viral hepatitis. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Beijing 302 Hospital. all patients were negative for hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and HIV-1 infection. all patients were hospitalized in the hospital from September 2010 to September 2011. 159 HBc sequences of genotype C were carefully searched from the NCBI protein database until 1 October 2008. eight peptides (8- and 10-mers) related to the P130T variation were also evaluated in this study. HLA-A*0201 heavy chains and 2 microglobulin (2m) were expressed in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and then in vitro refolded and assembled into correct advanced structures. the soluble refolded portion was concentrated and purified by HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography. all HLA-A2/peptide complexes were prepared as described above. they were diluted to a final concentration of 150 g/ml in a solution of 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. mice were immunized with the same formulation. plenocytes were incubated with PE-tetramer for 45 min at room temperature. then incubated with peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 antibody (Ab) and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 Ab (eBioscience) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. each test condition was performed in triplicate. the cell mixtures were stained with propidium iodide using a Vybrant apoptosis assay kit. the secretion levels of serum HBsAg in HBV transgenic mice were measured by ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions. CHB-S patients display clinical symptoms that meet at least one of the following criteria: serum albumin level of 32 g/liter, serum total bilirubin of >85.5 mol/liter, plasma prothrombin activity of 40 to 60%, and serum cholinesterase of 4,500 IU/liter. these 385 patients did not receive any antiviral therapeutic regimens for at least 1 year before clinical and virologic analysis. a total of 191 overlapping nonapeptides covering HBc amino acids 1 to 150 were synthesized. all peptides were purified to >95% purity at Jier Biological. transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. the fluorescence index (FI) was used to describe the binding capability of each candidate peptide. crystals grew at a final concentration of 15 mg/ml in 3.5 M sodium formate, pH 7.0. for cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol. data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 software package. splenocytes were stimulated with 20 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2) and 50 g/ml peptides for 10 days. splenocytes were first incubated with PE-tetramer for 45 min at room temperature and then incubated with peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 antibody. phytohemagglutinin served as a positive control. each test condition was performed in triplicate. the number of IFN- spots was counted and analyzed using an automatic ELISPOT reader. 130 and T130 complexed to HLA-A*0201 were deposited in PDB under accession codes 5E00 and 5WSH respectively."}
