{"summary": "five aerosol characterization instruments were used to measure aerosol production during patient care activities. each procedure was sampled 5 times and an SKC BioSampler was used for pathogen recovery. patients on contact precautions were selected for most activity sampling. each type of procedure was sampled 5 separate times. a family member or surrogate was asked to provide verbal assent if they were present. each procedure was sampled 5 separate times. a sidePak AM510 personal aerosol mobility spectrometer measures particle number concentration (mg/cm3), a portable aerosol mobility spectrometer (PAMS, Kanomax Inc), and a nanoparticle surface area monitor (NSAM,TSI Inc) all samples were collected using 2 sets of conductive silicone tubing that were hung at a single point 3 feet from the patient\u2019s head. Bacterial colonies were identified using the VITEK MS matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. after each procedure, the collection tubing was rinsed with ethanol and the BioSamplers were rinsed and autoclaved to reduce the potential for cross-contamination. patients were selected from among inpatients on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. patients were not prescreened for colonization or infection with specific organisms. aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) spectrometer measures particle number size distribution of larger aerosols (0.5\u201320 nm); nanoparticle surface area monitor (NSAM,TSI Inc), which measures lung-deposited surface area. all samples were collected using 2 sets of conductive silicone tubing that were hung at a single point 3 feet from the patient\u2019s head. a total of 35 procedures were sampled over a 4-month period from June through October 2015. no significant differences between baseline and procedure measurements were observed for bathing, changing linens, pouring liquids into the hopper, flushing the hopper, and bronchoscopy without NMA. a high amount of variation in particle concentration among the sampled procedures was indicated by the error bars in Figure 1. no baseline samples could be collected for these procedures. error bars = standard deviation. bronchoscopy patients produced a low concentration of 0.5- to 1.5-m particles. larger particles contribute more to mass concentration than smaller particles. nebulized particles are composed mainly of water. bronchoscopy with NMA was measured by portable aerosol mobility spectrometer (PAMS) (A); bronchoscopy with NMA as measured by PAMS (B); and APS (D) 25 samples were collected during procedures involving patients on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms. none of the drug-resistant organisms were recovered from any of these samples. no significant differences between baseline and procedure measurements were observed. samples collected during bronchoscopy with nebulized medication administration show wider concentration peaks. higher particle counts but lower mass concentrations indicative of smaller particle sizes. bronchoscopy with nebulized medication administration (NMA) showed only a small elevation from baseline. bronchoscopy with NMA showed only a small elevation from baseline. the most common culture result was mixed gram-positive flora. the most commonly isolated organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 12) and Micrococcus species (n = 6) microbiological analysis was used to determine the presence and viability of any bacterial organisms in these aerosols. nebulized medications are designed to be administered in aerosol form. nebulized medications are designed to be administered in aerosol form. the high particle concentrations are likely related to the use of a nebulizer during these procedures. the particles are most likely aerosolized medication that escaped from the nebulizer device. the extent of particle generation during NMA is probably related to the type of nebulizer used. current guidelines for HCP participating in suspected aerosol-generating procedures have had to rely on minimal or low-quality evidence. results suggest some of the procedures considered to be high risk for the generation of infectious aerosols may actually pose little infection risk to HCP."}
