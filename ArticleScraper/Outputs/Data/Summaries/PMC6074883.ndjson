{"summary": "coronaviruses are enveloped, spherical, or pleiomorphic viruses. they have a 5\u2032-capped, single-strand positive-sense RNA genome. genome is packaged into a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer. HCoV-OC43 apparently jumped from a bovine host into humans about 120 years ago. interest in this family of viruses grew in the aftermath of the SARS coronavirus, which resulted in a global outbreak of pneumonia in 2003. this episode led to the identification of many new family members. genome size, organization, and sequence revealed that MERS-CoV is a Betacoronavirus in lineage c (significantly different from SARS-CoV, which is also a Betacoronavirus but in lineage b) and human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are placed in lineage a.4,5 The virus is most closely related to several bat coronaviruses from various bat species in africa and Eurasia23. the only other human coronaviruses that replicate well in these monkey-cell lines are SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, both of which use human angiotensin\u2013converting enzyme 2 as their receptor. the cell receptor for the MERS-CoV has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). in April 2012, an outbreak of high fever and acute lower respiratory symptoms of unknown etiology was reported by the Ministry of Health in a hospital in Zarqa. 7 were nurses and 1 internist; 1 of the nurses later died. the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was confirmed by RT-PCR in 2 of those who had died. largely unknown but reported as prolonged in 1 documented instance of person-to-person transmission (9\u201312 days) compared to other human coronavirus infections. transmission to casual and social contacts is uncommon. a second cluster between 2 family contacts occurred in february 2013. one of the individuals died, and 1 recovered after experiencing a mild respiratory illness. similar clusters occurred in both the UK and Tunisia. of the 23 coronavirus-infected individuals in this outbreak, 65% died. most of the cases in this cluster had comorbidities. there is no evidence of any change in the infectiousness of MERS-CoV. the clinical syndrome is similar to SARS in which cases infected persons present initially with fever myalgia, malaise, and chills or rigor. one in 4 or 5 patients had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Variables MERS-CoV SARS-CoV Demographics Number of cases 136 752 Incubation periods (days; mean 95%) 5.2 (1.9\u201314.7); range 2\u201313 4.6(3.8\u20135.8); range 2\u201314 Age of patient 56 (mean 14\u201394) 39.9 (mean 1\u201391) Percent of children 5\u20136% 5\u20137% See distribution no. 83 male, 53 females, 409 females Ratio of male to female about 89% of patients reported from Saudi Arabia required admission to an ICU. 72% required mechanical ventilation or the implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 42 of the 77 patients were reported to have died. a person with a febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g., pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome) AND An inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (i.e. a positive screening test without confirmation) AND A resident of or traveler to Middle Eastern countries where MERS-CoV virus is believed to be circulating in 14 days before onset of illness. the ORF 1b assay is considered less sensitive than the ORF 1a assay but may be more specific. diagnostic laboratory work and PCR analysis should be conducted on clinical specimens from patients who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with novel coronavirus. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are not as sensitive as lower respiratory specimens for detecting MERS-CoV infections. serological tool based on protein microarray technology has been developed for the specific detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against MERS-CoV. the tool has been validated with a limited number of specimens using putative cross-reacting sera of patient cohorts exposed to the 4 common hCoVs and sera from convalescent patients infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. peg IFN was 50 to 100 times more effective for MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV. recent data suggests this is the most active agent in vitro of various compounds screened. the range of illness varies from asymptomatic infection to pneumonia with respiratory failure. it has been fatal in about half of all recorded infections. an active surveillance for clusters of cases of severe respiratory disease must be a priority."}
