{"summary": "murine models of inflammation are used in a wide variety of research areas. the overall structure of the immune system in mice, rats, and humans is quite similar. controversy exists about how closely murine models of inflammation match corresponding human diseases. current neutrophil separation methods, developed originally for human donors, require large volumes of blood [20, 21\u201322] and are less suitable for mice as a result of their significantly lower circulatory volume. many studies on mouse neutrophils are done with bone marrow cells [23] which are functionally immature. a combination of constrictions and turns in these channels blocks murine RBCs, while allowing neutrophil migration. microfluidic device designed to study mouse, rat, and human neutrophil chemotaxis from 1 droplet of whole blood. each neutrophil chemotaxis assay device includes 1 WBLC surrounded by 16 FCCs primed with chemoattractant. each device is 5 mm in diameter, and 12 assays can be run in parallel in 12well, glassbottom plates. migration channel significantly reduces the number of mouse RBCs in the migration channel (P 0.05) this prevents clogging of the migration channel and allows mouse neutrophils to migrate actively without obstruction. a 3 m pinch in the filtration comb size excludes mouse RBCs from obstructing the upstream migration channel. a 12well glassbottom plate was plasma treated, along with the PDMS donutshaped devices, and the devices bonded to the plate on a hot plate (85\u00b0C for 10 min) from mice, 50 l capillary blood was collected by the facial vein method by using 1\u20132% isoflurane inhalant. peptide fMLP (MW 437.55; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), recombinant human complement component C5a protein (8.3 kDa; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), recombinant mouse complement component C5a protein (8.0 kDa; R&D Systems), and LTB4 (MW 336.5; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) at least 50 neutrophils were manually tracked in the absence of cells. for each experiment, at least 50 neutrophils were manually tracked. the percentage of neutrophils migrating from the wholeblood sample was estimated. cells resuspended in 100 l RPMI 1640 were placed on each upper chamber of a 96well chemotaxis plate with 3 m pore diameter. in the lower chambers, 150 l of the RPMI medium was added. all migration channels were designed to be 12 m wide and 3 m high to establish only a single column of RBCs. chemoattractant is established along the migration channels by diffusion between the FCCs and WBLC. microfluidic platform to measure mouse, rat, and human neutrophil migratory function from a droplet of whole blood. damaged tissue and bacteria produce gradients of chemoattractants that act as a compass for neutrophil chemotaxis. mechanical filters that selectively block the advancement of human and murine RBCs. a 3 m layer of photoresist (SU8 2; MicroChem, Newton, MA, USA) was peeled off the master and punched with 1.5 and 5 mm punchers. a 12well glassbottom plate (MatTek, Ashland, MA, USA) was plasma treated, along with the PDMS donutshaped devices, and the devices bonded to the plate on a hot plate (85\u00b0C for 10 min) the blood from rats was aspirated in a pipette tip and then transferred to Eppendorf tubes. the tubes were incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow proper staining of the nuclei. the blood source for the assay does not significantly alter neutrophil migration patterns. the central WBLC and the outside region surrounding the donut were washed thoroughly in each well to establish the gradient along the migration channels. with the use of a gelloading tip, 2 l whole blood was slowly pipetted into the central WBLC (Supplemental Fig. 1). the percentage of neutrophils migrating from the wholeblood sample was estimated using a COMSOL simulation model. for human wholeblood samples, we calculated that 220 neutrophils in each well are exposed to on critical concentration of 1 nM. gradient concentration stronger than 1 pM/m was considered to be compatible with cell migration. h at 37\u00b0 under 5% CO2, the numbers of the cells in the lower chambers were counted. we calculated means and sd for each condition. differences were considered significant at P 0.05. a bifurcation in the channel creates a \u201cdecision point\u201d where neutrophils can migrate toward or away from the chemoattractant gradient. the size of the migration channels prevents the migration of lymphocytes and monocytes, which deform less. Neutrophil accumulation profiles in response to LTB4 were consistent over a 3 wk time period for the same mice (Sv129S6) this suggests that a neutrophil migration baseline is feasible and could provide a reliable reference in models of disease that evolve over time. microliter volumes of murine, rat, or human blood represent 0.1% of the total blood volume. the microfluidic device also has important advantages compared with recent techniques that rely on neutrophil capture from blood by selective adhesion. s toward LTB4 (13 7.4 m/min) was lower than that of Sv129S6 (19.7 8.7 m/min), rat (26.2 5.9 m/min), or human (23.4 5.4 m/min) neutrophils. fMLP failed to increase significantly the number of migrated neutrophils compared with controls. migration patterns reported previously from isolated human neutrophils. mouse blood assay uses concentrations of fMLP compatible with those used for human neutrophils. differences in affinity of mouse formyl peptide receptor 1 for fMLP. the design of our assay is the utmost specific for chemotaxing cells. the neutrophils that lack directionality have only a very low chance of reaching the FCC. the differences in mouse neutrophil migration toward fMLP are likely the reflection of differences in the biologic status of the cells. a new assay is available to perform singlecell resolution measurements of neutrophil migration from humans, mice, and rats. the assay revealed significant differences in neutrophil migratory responses, not only among species but among common laboratory mouse model strains. the pinch is key to reducing the number of murine RBCs advancing inside of the migration channel, from 47.9 9.8 to 2.3 3.3 cells. the trapped RBCs do not clog the channel at the pinch because of the difference in height between the channel (3 m) and the thickness of murine RBCs that can only enter the channel on the side. neutrophil accumulation curve varied 5% among the 3 samples. a neutrophil migration baseline is feasible and could provide a reliable reference in models of disease that evolve over time. a neutrophil migration baseline is feasible and could provide a reliable reference in models of disease that evolve over time. the microfluidic device avoids lengthy neutrophil isolation steps. it is performed in the presence of all blood components and could be highly multiplexed. it is performed in the presence of all blood components. a lower percentage of Wistar rat neutrophils migrated to fMLP and LTB4. the velocity of C57BL/6 neutrophils toward LTB4 was lower than that of Sv129S6 (19.7 8.7 m/min), rat (26.2 5.9 m/min), or human (23.4 5.4 m/min) neutrophils. neutrophils being activated by C5a in human blood samples compared with the mouse. directionality of mouse neutrophils toward C5a was lower than in humans. directionality toward LTB4 was comparable (Fig. 3D) the mouse blood assay uses concentrations of fMLP compatible with those used for human neutrophils. the design of our assay is the utmost specific for chemotaxing cells. the design of our assay is the utmost specific for chemotaxing cells. a new assay is available to perform singlecell resolution measurements of neutrophil migration from humans, mice, and rats. the assay revealed significant differences in neutrophil migratory responses, not only among species but among common laboratory mouse strains.
