{"summary": "in 2014, a sharp rise was observed in the number of cases of JE in north-eastern assam state. 51% of the total cases of JE in india were reported from the same year. a cross sectional study was conducted for 2 months among HCWs. JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis and disability in Asia. 30,000\u201350,000 cases of JE are reported each year with an estimate of 10,000 deaths annually. JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis and disability in Asia. a five-fold increase in cases from 2010 (n = 154) to 2014 (n = 744) is mainly due to recent changes in climatic conditions, agricultural practices, socio-cultural behaviour, abundance of potential mosquito vectors, and amplifying hosts in Assam state. in 2014, more than 51% of the total cases of JE were reported form Assam [11] the study was conducted for the period of 2 months from December 2014 to January 2015. the sample size was calculated on the basis of Raosoft calculator. the population size was kept as 500, power as 80%, response distribution as 50%. confidence interval and margin of error were set at 95% and 5% respectively. a final version of the questionnaire was then distributed to the study participants for data collection. a Cronbach's alpha of 0.72 and 0.77 was computed for knowledge and attitude sections respectively. participants were briefed about the objectives of the study and explained that the completion of the questionnaire would be taken as their consent to participate in this study. participants were explained that the completion of the questionnaire would be taken as their consent to participate in this study. a large proportion of participants were not aware of the seasonal abundance and potential of JE. 70.7% respondents incorrectly answered that antibiotics are the first line treatment of JE. 63.3% respondents incorrectly replied to this question. 57.8 people in rural agricultural areas are more prone to the JE 35 16.1 183 83.9 Vaccines are available for prevention of JE 15 6.9 203 93.1 Antibiotics are first line treatment 154 70.7 64 29.3 Antivirals are highly effective against JE 147 67.4 71 32.6 Knowledge of precautions need to be taken when dealing with JE patients 138 63.3 80 36.7 Note: Knowledge was assessed by giving 1 to correct answer and 0 to wrong 74.3% (n = 162) participants displayed positive attitudes towards JE. most negative attitude was observed when HCWs favoured intensive and emergency treatment for patients diagnosed with JE. JE is a preventable disease 0 0 27 (12.3) 191 (87.7) Controlling the breeding places of mosquitoes a good strategy to prevent JE 0 1 (0.6) 106 (48.6) 111 (50.9) Everyone residing in areas with intense JE viral transmission should be vaccinated 0 55 (25.2) 44 (20.2) 119 (54.6) the scale measured attitude from maximum 52 to minimum 13. scores of 40 were taken as negative attitude, > 40 as positive attitude. mean attitude score was 43.16 2.47. this is the first study which has evaluated the knowledge and attitudes of HCWs about JE in India, as well as globally. the results suggest that the overall knowledge of HCWs participated in this study was poor, especially about the management of JE. the results were not different when a research was carried out at the time of swine flu epidemic in Saudi Arabia [19]. there is a need to promote health research among healthcare workers in India as it may provide them important information about disease trends, risk factors and public health interventions. the findings could be due to the fact that physicians are more associated with patient\u2019s clinical record, counselling of patient than other HCWs. our findings indicate that age and profession were the common factors significantly associated with the knowledge and attitudes of HCWs."}
