{"summary": "the prevention of infectious bronchitis (IB) in chickens is achieved through the use of live and inactivated vaccines. this is probably due to the emergence of new variants of infectious bronchitis virus (1\u20135) for the successful protection of chickens against infection. the clearance of the IBV from the tracheal mucosa occurred at an early phase of the infection and that CTLs at the tracheal mucosa were proposed to be involved in this clearance. despite all of these reports, the kinetics of and the relationship between local and systemic HIR and CMI induced by different IBV vaccination regimes need to be better understood. the virus was titrated in chicken tracheal organ culture (TOC) as described before. the vaccines were mixed together in 100 ml of sterile water. each chick received a total of 100 l of the appropriate vaccine ocularly (50 l) and nasally (50 l) or SW. the titers of the vaccine viruses used were 3.5 log10 EID50/chick and 4.25 log10 EID50/chick for the H120 strain and CR88 strain. chicks in group I were inoculated oculonasally with 100 l of live H120 and CR88 vaccines simultaneously. group III received only 100 l of SW oculonasally and was kept as a control. the remaining portions were examined by histopathology and ciliostasis tests. the kidneys from all groups were also taken for histopathology and viral RNA load examination. immunoglobulin A (IgA) in tears and tracheal washes was assayed using a commercial ELISA kit. the two assays were carried out according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. the HI test was conducted according to standard procedures (OIE) tracheal samples were cut into 5-m sections, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min, air dried at room temperature, and stored at 80\u00b0C until staining. after endogenous peroxidase inhibition, the endogenous biotin or biotin-binding proteins in tissue sections were blocked with blocking serum using Vectastain Elite ABC kit. all monoclonal antibodies were procured from SouthernBiotech (Birmingham, AL, USA) for each sample, the average number of positive cells/400 microscopic field was calculated for each cell type. at 5 dpc, kidneys and tracheas from humanely euthanized birds were collected. amplification plots were recorded and analyzed, and the threshold cycle (CT) was determined with Rotor-Gene Q thermocycler software (Qiagen) the CT values were converted to log-relative equivalent units (REU) of viral RNA, done through generation of a standard curve of five 10-fold dilutions of extracted RNA from infective allantoic fluid of 106 EID50 of M41. the virus was titrated in chicken tracheal organ culture (TOC) as described before. the vaccines were prepared by thoroughly mixing one vial of live IBV H120 (Bioral H 120) vaccine with 100 ml of sterile water. each chick received 100 l of the appropriate vaccine ocularly (50 l) and nasally (50 l) or SW. in group II, chicks were inoculated with 100 l of live oculonasally. group III received only 100 l of oculonasally and was kept as a control. samples (5 birds/group) of serum, tears, and heparinized blood were collected at 0, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 doa before sacrificing the birds. 10 chicks from each group were challenged with a virulent IBV Q1. samples were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 3 min before supernatant was stored at 70\u00b0C until further use. serum samples were tested with a commercial IBV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. the HI test was conducted according to standard procedures (OIE) using 4 HA units of antigen per well. the HI titers were read as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing complete inhibition. the HI geometric mean titers were expressed as reciprocal log2. the stained cells were detected by flow cytometry (BD Accuri C6; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) to count the T lymphocytes. the unstained cell sample was used as a negative control to adjust the threshold. at 5 dpc, kidneys and tracheas from humanely euthanized birds were collected and fixed in 10% formalin. tissues were embedded in paraffin wax (50 to 60\u00b0C) and sections were cut to 7 m thickness. antibody levels in all three groups declined to below the cutoff point (396) by 14 doa. antibody levels in all three groups declined to below the cutoff point (396) by 14 doa. the level of serotype specific antibodies against homologous and heterologous antigens was evaluated by an HI test. the HI antibody responses against all the antigens used showed no significant difference (P 0.05) between the groups from 0 to 7 doa. however, a lower antibody response was obtained in all groups when the antigen used in the HI test was heterologous (Q1) to the viruses used in the vaccination. two groups were again vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age. one group was vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age. the levels of IgA in tracheal washes in the vaccinated groups were detected from 4 doa, peaking at 7 doa before declining until 28 doa. the levels of IgA in tracheal washes in the vaccinated groups were significantly higher than the levels from the unvaccinated control group. values between the two vaccine groups were significantly different (P 0.05) at those time points. error bars indicate standard error of the mean. systemic cell-mediated immune response in the trachea. the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in the trachea increased significantly (P 0.05) from 4 doa in the vaccinated groups compared to that in the control. after the second immunization, CD4+ cells strongly increased in number by 21 doa compared to those of the nonvaccinated controls. the two groups were again vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age. one group (group III) was kept as a control. no clinical signs were observed in either vaccinated group. cinated groups (I and II) measured by real-time RT-qPCR at 5 dpc. Vaccinated groups I and II showed mean log REUs of viral RNA of 1.016 and 0.555, respectively, with no significant difference between these groups. overall viral RNA in the kidney samples of all the groups was low compared to that in tracheal samples. no significant difference (P 0.05) in mean lesion scores with either group II or group III. overall mean lesion scores in kidneys were low compared to mean tracheal lesion scores. HI antibody responses against homologous and heterologous antigens were evaluated by an HI test. at 14 doa, the mean HI antibody titer to the CR88 antigen was significantly higher in group II (log2 8.2) than that in group I (log2 4.4) and that in group III (log2 1.8). at 28 doa, group II showed a significant increase of HI antibody response against CR88 following revaccination with a homologous antigen geometric mean standard error at days of ageb 0 4 7 14 21 28 M41 I 9.2 0.374A 8.2 0.970A 7.4 0.400A 5 0.000B 5 0.548A 4 0.447A II 9.2 0.374A 8.8 0.374A 7.4 0.400A 6.4 0.510A 5.4 0.400A 4.4 0.400A III 9.2 0.374A 7.2 0.374A 6.4 0.748A 4.8 0.200B 4 0.632 a 5.6 0.245A III 7 0.316A 3.4 0.316A 2.2 0.200A 2 0.000B 2 0.000B 2 0.000B 2 0.000C were vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age. the levels of IgA in tears increased significantly (P 0.05) compared to that in the control group III from 4 doa. the two groups were again vaccinated with CR88 at 14 days of age. one group (group III) was kept as a control. the IgA antibody levels in tears and tracheal wash from control chickens remained below the detectable level. the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in the trachea increased significantly (P 0.05) from 4 doa in the vaccinated groups compared to that in the control. the number of CD4+ cells reached its peak at 4 doa in group I and 7 doa in group II before gradually decreasing until 14 doa. no significant (P 0.05) difference was observed between the two vaccinated groups at 28 doa. immunohistochemical detection of CD4+ cells in group II at 28 days of age (B), CD8+ cells in group II at 28 days of age (C), and IgA-bearing B cells in group II at 28 days of age (D) in tracheas of chickens vaccinated with live H120 alone (group I) or in combination with CR88 (group II unvaccinated challenged group showed little protection (12%) compared to vaccinated challenged groups. viral RNA load in kidneys in group III was significantly higher (P 0.05) than in tracheal samples. tracheas and kidneys were previously vaccinated with live H120 alone. topathological changes occurred in group III (nonvaccinated group) with mean scores of 10.2. the mean lesion scores for kidneys in group III were significantly higher (P 0.05) than those in group II. however, overall mean lesion scores in kidneys were low compared to mean tracheal lesion scores. at 1 day of age, chicks had high ELISA anti-IBV antibody titers in all groups. these low antibody levels may result from partial neutralization of the vaccine virus in the target tissues. after the second vaccination at 14 doa, an increase in the antibody titers was observed until 28 doa in groups I and II. the role of IgA antibodies is important for mucosal immunity to IBV. gradual increases in IgA levels were observed in tears for the two vaccinated groups during the first 2 weeks after vaccination. a sharp decrease of IgA-IBV in vaccinated chicks was also observed after challenge (41). in the two vaccinated groups, the second vaccination did not cause any rise in tracheal IgA level. the revaccination with homologous IBV (44) and secondary M41 IBV exposure (38) did not induce the secondary secretory antibody response in tracheobronchial washings. the number of CD4+ lymphocytes started increasing from 4 doa in the two vaccinated groups compared to that of the control. at 28 doa, no significant difference was reported between the vaccinated groups. in the trachea, CD8+ cell recruitment in response to infection was at a maximum by 7 days postinfection (dpi) ciliary protection was higher in group II, vaccinated with mixed H120 and CR88 vaccines at 1 day old, than that in group I, vaccinated at 1 day old with H120 alone. the results of RT-qPCR showed that the viral RNA load at 5 dpc in the trachea was higher in group I than that in group II, although the difference was not statistically significant (P 0.05). group II's higher levels of IgA in lachrymal fluid than those of group I reduced the tracheal histopathological damage. this corroborates the hypothesis that the traditional role of IgA is to prevent pathogen entry at mucosal surfaces and neutralize virus in infected epithelial cells. a higher CD8+ cell response in the tracheal tissues in group II than in group I may have prevented the challenge virus from becoming viremic. this provided an efficient prevention of kidney infection as measured by viral RNA load and histopathological lesion scores in renal tissue. chicks vaccinated with H120 and CR88 at 1 day old followed by CR88 at 14 doa showed significantly higher CD8+ responses in the trachea and kidneys."}
