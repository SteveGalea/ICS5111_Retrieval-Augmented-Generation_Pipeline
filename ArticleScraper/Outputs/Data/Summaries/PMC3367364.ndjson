{"summary": "retrospective analysis is based on the nationwide database on SARS cases reported from March to July 2003 to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan. the criteria for reporting SARS patients evolved over time but were principally adopted from the world health organization. the total reported probable SARS patients in Taiwan were 665. a sample of SARS patients from 3 hospitals represented 3 healthcare accreditation levels in Taiwan. a major medical center, a regional teaching hospital, and a district hospital (Taipei Hospital) a duration of illness was used as a surrogate for clinical severity among the surviving SARS patients, and death rate was also used as severity index. differences in frequencies or proportions were tested using a 2 test and by risk ratios. multivariate logistic regression (17) was used to analyze factors that can affect seropositivity, including demographic information, source of infection, and duration of illness. no antiviral drug was known to shorten the clinical course of SARS. the duration of illness can be assumed to reflect the clinical severity of SARS manifested by the patient. a patient with a severe clinical course mainly had a slower and prolonged recovery (16). Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed with SAS software. differences in frequencies or proportions were tested using a 2 test. the continuous variables, i.e., age distribution or titers of neutralizing antibody, were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric method. 32 of these 100 diagnoses based on RT-PCR alone had convalescent-phase serum specimens that tested negative. 68 did not have appropriate convalescent-phase serum specimens for antibody testing because of death, loss to follow-up or inappropriate timing of serum collection. negative results of the 32 patients were false-positive instances of virus detection by RT-PCR. the seronegative rate was significantly higher in men than in women. the effect of age was not statistically significant (p = 0.07 in men, 2 test) n (%) Known 8/212 (3.7) Hospital-associated Patient 81 3/44 (6.8) Healthcare worker 82 2/71 (3.1) Other worker 27 1/19 (4.0) Unknown 23/51 (45.1) Imported 22 11/20 (55.0) Indigenous 36 12/31 (38.7) *Seronegative rates of the 2 groups with known and unknown source of infection were significantly different (2, p0.10\u20137) log2 (neutralizing antibody titer) = 0 + 1 (age) \u2013 1 (sex) + 3 (infection source) + 4 (duration of illness) + 5 (time of convalescent-phase serum sample) = 1 to 4. of 247 seropositive SARS patients, 217 (87.8%) of the patients were seropositive by week 3; 27 (17.4%) of 155 patients who were called early. on rare occasions (1.21%, 3/247), seroconversion occurred after week 6 of symptoms onset. we used regression-based modeling approach to examine these factors simultaneously. the model suggested that neutralizing antibody rose and diminished during the follow-up period between weeks 3 and 13 after onset of illness. cross-sectional curves of neutralizing antibody titer (dilution) extracted from panel A. duration of illness set at 10, 17, 24, and 31 days respectively. vertical lines mark peak titer times. the antibodies titer of those who died (n = 8) was not significantly higher than those who survived (median titer = 32) the early seroresponders were significantly older (mean age 43.7 years) than the 128 case-patients who seroconverted after week 2 of illness (mean age 37.3 years) participants Specimens from all patients with probable SARS in Taiwan were serologically tested for case confirmation. 347 of 665 reported probable SARS cases were confirmed. these included cases in 126 patients whose diagnoses were based on serologic testing alone, 121 whose results were positive by both tests. 32 (9.2) ND/positive 68 (19.7) data not available because of loss to follow-up or insufficient number of specimens (n = 8), death (n = 55), or serum collected on the 3rd week (n = 5) of fever onset. seronegative results were false-positive instances of virus detection by RT-PCR. patients with a known source of infection were more likely to possess a detectable level of neutralizing antibody than those with no discernible infection source and shorter duration of illness. a logistic regression model confirmed that patients with a known source of infection were more likely to possess a detectable level of neutralizing antibody than those with no discernible infection source. infection source, known vs. unknown 15.6 (5.9-41.4) 0.0001 0.248 + 0.313 0.431 Duration of illness (d) 1.08 (1.025-1.143) 0.004 0.0638 + 0.0233 0.008 Time of convalescent-phase serum sample (weeks after fever onset) sex, the odds for women to be seropositive is 1.24 (OR) when compared with men. the time of convalescent-phase serum collection (in weeks postonset of illness, starting from week 3) contributed in 3 terms. the antibody rise follows the first order of weeks postonset, and decay follows the second order of weeks postonset. body in patients with more severe clinical courses tended to decay at a faster rate than in patients with shorter clinical course. this pattern of decay followed a half-life of 6.4 weeks after reaching the peak, which occurred between weeks 5 and 8 after infection. the time that the blood was collected for each patient was examined. the model suggested that antibody response was higher and occurred earlier in patients with a more severe clinical course than in those with a shorter clinical course. early responders had a significantly higher mortality rate (29.6% vs. 7.8%) than others who did not undergo seroconversion until week 3 of illness or later. early seroresponders OR p value Yes, n (%) No, n (%) Died Yes 29.6 (8) 7.8 (10) 4.97 0.004 No 70.4 (19) 92.2 (118) 1.00

patent's low antibody level in combination with the low sensitivity of the antibody test. a low antibody response may be associated with a primary infection of SARS-CoV. a robust humoral immune response requires antigen in sufficient doses. the lack of detectable antibody among patients without history of contact with a known SARS patient might be associated with a low inoculum of the virus because of incidental exposures. some healthcare workers and public health personnel who had a history of direct contact with patients were shown to harbor nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV. this raises the possibility of asymptomatic mucosal epithelial colonization by SARS-CoV. studies suggest activation of Th1 cell\u2013mediated immunity and a hyperinnate inflammatory response are responsible for the pathogenic process in severe infection (5). the high antibody response and a strong cell-mediated Th1 response may reasonably be understood as concurrent events, and the latter may be causally related to a severe clinical course of SARS. a number of SARS patients have been treated with convalescent-phase serum of SARS patients and show no adverse effect. a significant higher proportion of early responders than other SARS patients possess antibody against non-SARS coronavirus during the acute phase. the number of early responders for whom information on virus load was available was too few. early neutralizing antibody responders are more likely to be older, to have a higher case-fatality rate, and to survive for a shorter time. these observations should raise the concerns of possible ADE in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection in humans. the neutralizing antibody test is based on the reading of a complete inhibition of cytopathic effect. the absolute titer is expected to be lower than the results, based on reading of 50% inhibition. a low antibody response may be associated with a primary infection of SARS-CoV, as seen with primary infection of respiratory syncytial virus. reintroduction of SARS-CoV to humans is possible. pulmonary functions worsen during week 2 of illness (5,25-27), while the virus load in the airway decreases. patients with mild disease would begin to stabilize clinically. early responders have a detectable neutralizing antibody during the first 2 weeks of illness. the basis for early antibody response is not apparent, but 1 possibility is the priming effect of a previous non-SARS-CoV infection. antibody against SARS-CoV cross-reacts with human coronavirus 229E (2). a number of early responders for whom information on virus load was available was too few to yield a meaningful statistical analysis on whether high virus load is correlated with an early humoral response. if corroborated with further analysis of data collected in other countries, should raise the concerns of possible ADE in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection in humans."}
