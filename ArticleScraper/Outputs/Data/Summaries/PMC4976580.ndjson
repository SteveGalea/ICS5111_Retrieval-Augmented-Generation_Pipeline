{"summary": "a case of lung adenocarcinoma complicated with respiratory failure is reported to show diffuse uniform ground-glass shadow in the chest computed tomography (CT) a 56-year-old female patient was admitted to hangzhou Normal University Affiliated Hospital on November 12, 2014. she had fever for 1 week with the highest temperature reaching 39\u00b0C, coughed white sputum with no blood or yellowish stuff, and complained chest tightness and dyspnea when severe coughing. chest CT scan found diffused uniform ground-glass shadow in two lungs with no enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. preliminary diagnosis revealed diffuse lung disease of unknown origin, respiratory failure, type 2 diabetes, and (3) schizophrenia. hs-CRP, leukocyte 19.67 109/L, percentage of neutrophils 91.0%, 6.1% of lymphocyte percentage and 0 of eosinophil cell percentage, red-cell count 4.65 1012/L and 130 g/L of hemoglobin. antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded-DNA, anti-Sjogren syndrome A antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome B antibody and other autoantibodies were all negative. acid fast bacilli is negative in 3 smear tests. sputum cytology found no tumor cells. electrocardiograph: sinus rhythm. the patient died of respiratory failure on the 20th day after admission. chest CT scan showed ground-glass-like change due to diffuse exudation in the two lungs often suggests special pathogen infection. hematogenous pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by toxic symptoms of tuberculosis. acute interstitial pneumonia is acute onset, manifested as glass-like change with fuzzy hair. the chest CT showed diffuse exudation, uniform ground-glass shadow. acute interstitial pneumonia is acute onset, manifested as glass-like change with fuzzy hair. pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary spore bacteria pneumonia, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza were excluded. congest heart failure and acute pulmonary edema are also excluded. pathologic analysis is very important to disease diagnosis and treatment. the patient was diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma by TBLB examination. percutaneous lung puncture and TBLB is a common clinical biopsy method. the positive rate of TBLB in diffuse lung adenocarcinoma was about 58.3%. a large number of secretions gathered in the lung, causing diffuse infiltration, exudation. the formation of diffuse ground-glass shadow was related with infiltration hypersecretion of cancer cell."}
