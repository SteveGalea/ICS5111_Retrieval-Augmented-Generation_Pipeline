{"summary": "equilibrium between the monomer and DS-dimer is established in a few hours when the temperature is raised to 37 \u00b0C. the observed mass ratios between the monomer and DS-dimer at equilibrium are almost the same in the temperature range of 33\u201339 \u00b0C at a protein concentration of 0.5 mM. mass percentage of the monomer (solid line) and DS-dimer (broken line) as a function of time for conversion of Mpro-C monomer into DS-dimer at 37 \u00b0C (red), 33 \u00b0C (black), and 25\u00b0 C/urea (green) the rate of interconversion is highly dependent on temperature, and the half conversion time (t1/2) is about 2 h at 37 \u00b0C and about 20 h at 33 \u00b0C. thalpy of activation is 374 kJ/mol for dimerization and 436 kJ/mol for dimer dissociation, indicating there is a huge energy barrier between the two states. the size of this energy barrier is consistent with that of other similar systems, such as stefin A (6) and cyanovirin-N (19). the DS-dimer would firstly dissociate into monomers as the temperature is increased during the thermal unfolding experiment. however, the thermal denaturation data should mainly reflect unfolding of the monomeric protein. CD spectrum of the monomer at 37 \u00b0C showed a small decrease in the negative ellipticity at 222 nm compared with that at 25 \u00b0C. both CD and NMR analysis demonstrated that Mpro-C monomer is well folded under swappable conditions. the intact 5-helix is in blue, and the disordered \u201c5-helix\u201d is in red. kex was obtained for 54 out of 120 residues, ranging from 10-1 min-1 to 10-6 min-1. no amide exchanging too fast to allow determination of kex is located on 1-4 helices. kex was only determined for residue V296, while all other amides on 5-helix exchange too fast. at 37 \u00b0C, the swappable condition, kex, of 42 backbone NHs could be measured. amides of 13 residues located mainly around loops or turns exchange too fast at 37 \u00b0C. GH-D values of residues on 1-helix range from 31 to 34 kJ/mol. 5-helix (residues P293-C300) in Mpro-Cds becomes unstructured in Mpro-Cds. the other four -helices are essentially the same as those in Mpro-Cds. the number of NOEs observed at 37 \u00b0C is much less than that in Mpro-Cnds. 5-helix in Mpro-Cnds also becomes disordered and flexible at 37 \u00b0C. the disruption of 5-helix in Mpro-Cnds may be related to unfolding of 5-helix. -C292 expressed in E. coli showed only one peak eluted at 83.9 ml on gel-filtration column at 25 \u00b0C. no dimer could be observed after Mpro-C292 was either incubated at 37 \u00b0C or treated with 2.5 M urea at 25 \u00b0C for hours. this result suggests that the disordered \u201c5-helix\u201d of Mpro-C is required for the conversion of monomer to DS-dimer. residue F294 is vital for conversion of Mpro-C294 from monomer into DS-dimer. residue D295 renders conversion rate of Mpro-C295 to be approximately 4 times faster than that of Mpro-C294. F294K yes 53.6 0.7 37.7 0.4 Mpro-CF294D F294D yes 62.0 0.2 1.3 0.8 Mpro-CF294W F294W yes 59.1 0.2 7.2 0.6 Mpro-CD295A D295A yes 58.3 0.7 7.3 0.9 Mpro-CD295K D295K yes 52.0 0.6 226 3 Mpro-CF294A/D295A yes 57.0 side-chains of both F294 and D295 are exposed to solvent without much contact with other parts of the protein. we also studied the effect of point mutation for these two residues on the interconversion between Mpro-C monomer and DS-dimer. however, mutation D295A destabilizes the protein, but causes approximately 40% decrease in the conversion rate. some NH peaks of Mpro-C at 37 \u00b0C display concentration dependent line broadening. NH signals of residues Q189-D197, T199-A206, T226-N228, E240, T243, M276-G278, and I286, L287, D289-F292, F294-Q306 are getting much weaker at higher concentration. HSQC spectra of Mpro-C with concentration of 0.1 mM (blue) and 2.0 mM (red) at 25 \u00b0C (A), 25\u00b0 C/urea (B) and 37 \u00b0C (C) results suggest that Mpro-C molecules can self-associate due to the disordered \u201c5-helix\u201d under swappable conditions."}
