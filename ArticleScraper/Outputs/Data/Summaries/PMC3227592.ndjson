{"summary": "combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) has curtailed viral replication below the detection limit (50 copies/mL) cART works by blocking infection of susceptible new cells, while the decay rate of plasma virus is determined by the life span of previously infected cells. flavonoids contain a characteristic 2-phenylchromene-4-one ring structure. they have shown therapeutic value, including antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. they act as anti-oxidants and free-radical scavengers, dramatically reducing inflammatory responses. e TZM-bl reporter cells after 48 h treatment with luteolin (LN), myricetin (MN), or quercetin (QN), using DMSO as vehicle (Veh) or AZT (positive control) results were plotted as mean SEM of duplicate readings normalized with cell control. luteolin was shown to be effective against SARS coronavirus. anti-HIV treatment leads to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a substantial number of African patients [39]\u2013[40]. a continuing search for new therapeutic agents to target novel viral life cycle stages is needed. luteolin showed slight toxicity in TZM-bl reporter cells. toxicity of luteolin in TZM-bl cells could result from multiple stable constructs. luteolin in concentrations between 5 and 10 M, the upper limit for therapeutic agents used in screening assays, had significant antiviral activity. so, we used luteolin at 5 and 10 M for all experiments (Fig. 2). we confirmed the anti-HIV-1 activity of luteolin in infection assays in lymphocytic cells. TZM-bl cells were pretreated for 30 min with 0, 5, and 10 M luteolin. they were then infected with HIV-1 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. luteolin was non-toxic to primary cells. luteolin treatment of HIV-1 infected lymphocytes also showed inhibition in cell aggregation/syncytia. luteolin did not affect proliferation of lymphocytes during viral inhibition studies. TZM-bl cells were pretreated with luteolin or DMSO for 30 min. then infected with HIV-1 (p24 = 250 ng/ml) to corroborate the effect of luteolin on viral entry. luteolin inhibited HIV-1 independently of viral entry and reverse transcription steps. p24 levels were estimated in cell lysates after normalization of protein concentrations. the results are presented as the amount of p24 present per mg of proteins in cell lysates. NL4-3 mutant (D64A) defective in viral DNA integration function (INT HIV) was used as negative control (n = 4) luteolin inhibited HIV-1 infection independent of viral entry. we then investigated whether luteolin had any effect on viral reverse transcription. luteolin was unable to annihilate viral reverse transcription. luteolin-mediated suppression of HIV-1 expression was evident irrespective of the time after infection when treatment was initiated (4\u201312 h) the suppression of HIV-1 infection in cells treated with luteolin at 12 h post-infection suggests that luteolin has an inhibitory effect on the HIV-1 life cycle mainly if not exclusively at the postintegration stage. TZM-bl reporter cells in 12 well culture plates were transfected with HIV-1 plasmid DNA vector expressing GFP. in parallel, TZM-bl cells were infected with VSV-HIV NLENG1 or NLR+E for 2 h. at 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (n = 2). luteolin treatment suppressed both luciferase expression and viral p24 antigen. luteolin-mediated suppression of the LTR-luciferase activity has been demonstrated after HIV-1 plasmid DNA transfection or HIV-1 infection. cells contain HIV-1 provirus in a latent state without any viral gene expression including GFP [44], [45], [48] on induction by TNF- (NF-B activation) but viral reactivation is initiated. TNF-- reactivated latent HIV-1 infection was attenuated by treatment with luteolin (10 M), demonstrating reduction in GFP expression. SVGA-LTR-GFP reporter cells were transduced with VSV-Tat viral particles for 2 h, then treated with 10 M luteolin or vehicle and, after 24 h, monitored for GFP expression. luteolin confers its anti-HIV-1 activity by inhibiting HIV-1 transcription, translation, or post\u2013translational processing. luteolin inhibited clade B and \u2013C Tat\u2013mediated LTR transactivation in TZM-bl reporter cells. TZM-bl cells were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-Tat-HA. a Tat-specific siRNA cocktail of 3 siRNAs (300 nM) was co-transfected with Tat expression vector as a positive control. cells were immunostained for Tat (red), B23/nucleophosmin (green), and nuclei (blue) images were captured at 20 with a Nikon fluorescent microscope. luteolin treatment had no affect on Tat protein levels as analyzed by Western blotting. luteolin treatment profoundly inhibited LTR-mediated luciferase expression in both clade-B and -C transfected cells. transcriptionally inactive Tat-47 mutant (48\u201356) deleted in nuclear localization signal was used as negative control, demonstrating only basal luciferase activity in both TZM-bl cells. luteolin may abrogate Tat-mediated LTR transactivation activity by interfering with pTEF-b binding with LTR or abolish Tat binding. luteolin confers its anti-HIV-1 activity at the Tat-LTR transactivation level (transcription step) after the viral integration step. however, further investigations of the action of luteolin are needed. luteolin may complement combination anti-HIV therapy by preventing synthesis of viral proteins available for protease steps. this would enhance the potency of protease inhibitors, eventually leading to reduced virus assembly and release. luteolin crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to confer neuroprotective effects via inhibition of neuroinflammation [28], [69]\u2013[71]. jurkat cells were grown in RPMI with 2 mM L-glutamine and RPMI (Gibco-BRL) each supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (GibcoBRL) stocks for luteolin, quercetin, and myricetin were prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) subtype B Tat with HA tag was cloned into pcDNA3.0 vector. functionally inactive subtype B mutant was created by deletion of nuclear localization signal (amino acids 47\u201356) viral stocks were treated with 5 IU/ml of RNase-free DNase for 15 min at room temperature and membrane\u2013filtered. p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix, Buffalo, NY) or transducing SVGA-LTR-GFP reporter cells. protein bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. overnight, membranes were probed at 4\u00b0C with rabbit polyclonal antibody against HA peptide. slides were washed three times with PBS and overlaid with alexa-568 conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (1500) and alexa-488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse (1500), then incubated at 25\u00b0C for 35 min. slides were examined with microscope and images acquired at 20 magnification. e activity as relative luciferase units normalized to cell control. real-time PCR and Alu-HIV-1 integration PCR. nested alu-HIV-1 integration PCR was done as described previously. the primers for second round were INT-1: 5\u2032-TGCTGGGATTACAGG GCGTGAG-3\u2032 INT-2: 5\u2032-TAGACCAGATC- TGAGCCTGGGA-3\u2032. TZM-bl or HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5104 per well. after 24 or 48 h, we measured the viability of cells after removing the culture medium and adding 100 l of cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent. TZM-bl, SVGA-LTR-GFP cells were grown in DMEM. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI with 2 mM L-glutamine and RPMI. stocks for luteolin, quercetin, and myricetin were prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide. full-length subtype B Tat (101 amino acids) was subcloned from pcDNA-Tat. HA tag was inserted at the C-terminus of full-length subtype B and subtype C Tat. functionally inactive subtype B mutant was created by deletion of nuclear localization signal (amino acids 47\u201356) and was cloned with HA tag. cells were transfected with 10.0 g pLVX-Tat or pLVX with 3.0 g pCMV-Tat, 8.0 g pGag-Pol, 4.0 g pCMV-Rev, 2.5 g pVpr, and 4.0 g pVSV-G using Lipofectamine 2000. viral stocks were treated with 5 IU/ml of RNase-free DNase for 15 min at room temperature and membrane Western blotting and immunofluorescence TZM-bl cells were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-Tat-HA and treated them with luteolin or DMSO. cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce); 30 g of total protein from each sample was then analysed on 12% SDS-PAGE. heLa cells seeded in slide flaskets were transfected with 500 ng of pcDNA-Tat-HA expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 25\u00b0C. at 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. 30 l of cell lysates was used to monitor luciferase activity in a 100-l reaction using ready-glow firefly luciferase substrate (Promega) we quantified the luminescence in optilux black plates (Falcon) using a multi-mode microplate reader. then calculated the percent of LTR luciferase activity as relative luciferase units normalized to cell control. the reactions were run on a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-RAD) data were collected and analyzed using Bio-RAD CFX Manager software v 1.1. nested Alu-HIV-1 integration PCR was done as described previously. the amplified PCR products were separated and visualized on agarose gel. the percent of integrated HIV-1 DNA was calculated relative to positive control (24 h after infection with VSV-HIV-1) EM for each bar graph plotted using Sigma plot v8.0. significance between two groups was calculated using a two-tailed student's t-test."}
