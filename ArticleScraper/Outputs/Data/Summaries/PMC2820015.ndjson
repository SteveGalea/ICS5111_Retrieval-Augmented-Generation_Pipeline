{"summary": "the precise mechanism by which lipid rafts functions in targeting viral Env and Gag to the plasma membrane in infected T cells is not clearly understood. however, the precise mechanism by which lipid rafts functions in targeting viral Env and Gag to the plasma membrane in infected T cells is not clearly understood. p17 matrix domain interacts with gp41 cytoplasmic domain of envelope [14,23-25]. the association of HIV Gag in DRM is dependent on expression of HA and NA glycoproteins [27], while the Rous sarcoma virus M protein requires expression with the F protein for DRM association. a point mutation (L30E) in matrix domain of Gag previously reported to abrogate envelope incorporation, infectivity and infectivity [23] and DRM association [13] in cell lines affect infectivity and modulate envelope association with CD59-enriched compartment. primary CD4+ T cells were purified by negative selection from whole blood using RosetteSep\u00ae Kit (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) gp41 monoclonal antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 were incubated for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. gp41 washed with cold PBS and resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE. blot assay done with anti-human CD59 antibody. CD4+ T cells infected with VSV-G pseudotyped pNL4.3 and pNL4.3 (L30E) were lyzed and intracellular p55, gp41 and CD59 contents were measured in total cell lysates. cell lysates expressing comparable p55 and gp41 were immunoprecipitated with gp41 antibodies 2F5 and 4E10. monoclonal antibody (2F5) [31] and 4E10 [33], mouse anti-human CD59 (BD Biosciences Inc) and cholera toxin conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) respectively. our results were further substantiated by the presence of both CD59 and GM1 in DRM fractions. the lipid-binding B subunit of cholera toxin (CTxB) was used to study the envelope transport into lipid rafts. the oligomeric envelope protein is synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. we thank NIH AIDS Reagent and Reference Program for 183-H12-5C Hybridoma, 2F5 and 4E10 monoclonal antibodies. this study was supported by a fellowship grant from American Foundation of AIDS Research."}
