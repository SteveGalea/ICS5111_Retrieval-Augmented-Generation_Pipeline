{"summary": "bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) was first reported in 2007 in Germany. it affects calves aged up to 4 weeks, causing skin and internal haemorrhages, prolonged haemorrhage from wounds or orifices, and high case fatality (90%). no evidence of an infectious, toxic or genetic aetiology has been found [2], [5]\u2013[7]. the blood samples collected from calves on the farms were taken for diagnostic purposes at the request of the owner. no formal approval of the protocol by an ethical committee in any of the four countries was required. the study was conducted between January and December 2011. up to four calves without BNP clinical signs and aged 10\u201328 days were selected from the same farm to be matched controls. a control was defined as a calf on the same farm as a case, aged 10\u201328 days at the time of case reporting. a control was defined as a calf that had developed one or more BNP clinical signs on or before 28 days of age. risk factors related to colostrum and milk feeding, dam and sire characteristics, and dam vaccination history were dropped. five variables identified the calf, dam and sire. twenty two variables describing clinical and post-mortem signs and laboratory results were used to define cases and controls. the population attributable fraction, PAF (proportion of cases in the total population that would be avoided if the exposure was removed), was estimated using the punafcc package for Stata [12] Ethics Statement All procedures on animals used in this study were in concordance with the ethical conditions for animal experimentation. all farms that reported suspected cases were visited by a veterinarian. if the calf was less than 29 days of age and had one or more clinical signs of BNP; multiple skin haemorrhages, melena, petechiation of mucous membranes, then it was included in the study as a suspected case. the questionnaire was developed in English, translated into French and German. 36 collected descriptive data on calf, dam and sire identification, calf characteristics, clinical signs and laboratory results. 55 collected data on potential risk factors related to colostrum and milk feeding, dam and sire characteristics and dam vaccination history. s with p values greater than 0.2 in univariable analysis were excluded from multivariable analysis. multivariable analysis was conducted using conditional logistic regression. the model was built using forward stepwise regression. in the Netherlands, dairy farms predominate so almost all suspected calves came from dairy farms. the proportion of males amongst cases (41%) was higher than amongst controls (34%). in the Netherlands, cases were more likely than controls to be male probably due to the sale of male calves before one month of age. m received by 0\u20135 1.00 calf, litres (916) 5.5\u201310 1.83 0.86, 3.88 0.12 10.5\u201320 4.00 0.89, 18.00 0.07 20.5\u201330 6.90 0.45, 106.20 0.17 Ad lib 4.18 0.41, 42.95 0.23 Colostrum obtained from no 1.00 cow(s) different from dam, pooled colostrum, pooled colostrum includes colostrum of dam, pooled colostrum, pooled colostrum includes colostrum of dam and frozen colostrum were nested within it. there was no association between case/control status and feeding raw milk, bulk milk, raw milk from dam only, and type of milk fed. no evidence of an association between case/control status and dam breed. dam was born on farm, dam was reared at another farm, or source of bull. case dams had 12 times the odds of previously giving birth to a BNP calf.

ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024) and 5 times the odds of having a third lactation dam (amOR 5.3; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = 0.001) compared with a control. population attributable fraction (PAF) for dam PregSure vaccination was 0.84 (ci 0.68, 0.92). if no pregSure-vaccinated cows had been used for breeding then 84% of cases would have been avoided. if calves had not been fed exclusively on their dam\u2019s milk, then 15% of cases would have been avoided. if a dam had been PregSure-vaccinated and the calf received colostrum from its dam then there was an increased odds of BNP. but feeding colostrum from other cows increased the chance of the calf ingesting some colostrum from a pregSure-vaccinated cow. 20 cases in this study had no apparent exposure to the identified risk factors. they could have been misclassified with respect to dam vaccination status, colostrum feeding or dam\u2019s BNP history due to incorrect farmer recall. animals vaccinated with three doses of PregSure had higher alloantibody titres compared with animals receiving a single PregSure dose or other BVD vaccines [10]. this supports our finding that the odds of BNP increase with the number of PregSure doses given to the dam. a case-control study is the most appropriate design to investigate a rare disease. the multi-country design meant that there was variation between countries in case-reporting, farm visits, sample collection, post-mortem examination and questionnaire interpretation. there were also differences between countries in production methods, cattle breeds, and policies on BVD control and vaccination programmes. the blood values for case calves were set at >300109/litre thrombocytes and >5109/litre leucocytes. the number of questions in the questionnaire was high, to capture management practices in the four countries. this increased the risk of detecting an association by chance when there was no true association.
