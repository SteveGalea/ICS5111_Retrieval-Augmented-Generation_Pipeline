{"summary": "asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration and accumulation of memory-like Th2 cells and eosinophils. Rhinovirus (RV) infection has emerged as the most common cause of severe episodes of asthma in children and adults. inducible expression of TSLP in airway epithelial cells has been shown to be controlled by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B). licochalcone A has been found to inhibit TNF-induced NF-B activation by the inhibition of IB kinase complex activation. real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR Total RNA (2 g) was reverse transcribed using the oligo (dT) primer and murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. amplification was performed for 40 cycles consisting of denaturation for 10 s at 94\u00b0C. the threshold cycle number (CT) was used to define the initial amount of each template. the mRNA expression levels were determined and compared with the GAPDH standard. whole cell lysates were prepared by radio immunoprecipitation assay. the cell extracts were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. the membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] for 2 h at room temperature. after washing three times in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies. DNA\u2013protein complexes were separated on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3. cells were preincubated with or without 30 mol/L Licochalcone A (Sigma) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C after stimulation with or without 5 g/mL Poly-IC (Sigma) for 30 min. TSLP concentration in each supernatant was quantified using an human TSLP quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) the results were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) the results were significant with a value of P 0.05. amplification was performed for 40 cycles consisting of denaturation for 10 s at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 56\u00b0C, and extension for 40 s at 72\u00b0C. the threshold cycle number (CT) was used to define the initial amount of each template. nuclear extracts were prepared using 200 mL of lysis buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 79, 10 mmol/L KCl, 01 mmol/L EDTA, 01 mmol/L ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA]) after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, supernatants were discarded and the pellets were processed further to obtain nuclear extracts. anti-P-p65(s536), anti-I kinase (anti-IKK), anti-IKK, anti-actin, anti-IB, and anti-Lamin B (Santa Cruz Technology, Santa Cruz, CA) after washing three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) the membranes were developed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and exposed to d with anti-IKK antibody with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. kinase reaction in 20 L of kinase buffer including [-32 P]ATP was carried out with 1 g of GST-IB as a substrate for 20 min at 30\u00b0C. beas 2B cells were treated with various doses of licochalcone A and at different times after poly-IC stimulation for 30 min. licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced secretion of TSLP in airway epithelial cells. no cytotoxic effect of licochalcone A treatment and/or poly-IC stimulation was observed in our experimental conditions. licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced secretion of TSLP in PBECs. not detected Licochalcone A significantly inhibited poly-IC-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-kB. expression of human TSLP mRNA is controlled by NF-kB. beas 2B cells were incubated with indicated doses of licochalcone A for 24 h. the expression of both NF-B p50 and p65 was down-regulated dose dependently. licochalcone A markedly inhibited poly-IC-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-B. beas 2B cells were incubated with 30 mol/L licochalcone A for 24 h after stimulation with poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. nuclear extracts were prepared and Western blotting analysis for NF-B p65 was performed. licochalcone A inhibited NF-B activation induced by poly-IC. expression levels of IKK, IKK, and IKK unchanged in cells treated with 30 mol/L licochalcone A. anti-IKK activity was measured using GST\u2013IB as a substrate. licochalcone A significantly inhibited poly-IC-induced IKK activation. licochalcone A inhibited NF-B activation by suppressing IKK activity. beas 2B cells were incubated with or without 30 mol/L licochalcone A for 3 h after stimulation with or without poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. then a whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho p65 antibody (Ser276) or p65 Licochalcone A significantly inhibited poly-IC-induced expression of MCP-1, RANTES, and IL-8. beas 2B cells were incubated with indicated doses of licochalcone A for 3 h after stimulation with poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced secretion of TSLP in airway epithelial cells. no cytotoxic effect of licochalcone A treatment and/or poly-IC stimulation was observed. licochalcone A suppressed poly-IC-induced secretion of TSLP in PBECs. PBECs were incubated with indicated doses of licochalcone A for 3 h after stimulation with poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. beas 2B cells were treated with various doses of licochalcone A for 24 h. expression of both NF-B p50 and p65 was down-regulated dose dependently. licochalcone A markedly inhibited poly-IC-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-B. beas 2B cells were incubated with licochalcone A for 24 h after stimulation with poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. nuclear extracts were prepared and Western blotting analysis for NF-B p65 was performed. expression levels of IKK, IKK, and IKK unchanged in cells treated with 30 mol/L licochalcone A. inhibition of NF-B activation by licochalcone A was not due to altered expression of IKK subunits. licochalcone A significantly inhibited poly-IC-induced IKK activation. licochalcone A strongly inhibited poly-IC-induced IB degradation. these data indicate that licochalcone A inhibited NF-B activation. beas 2B cells were incubated with or without 30 mol/L licochalcone A for 3 h after stimulation with or without poly-IC (5 g/mL) for 30 min. licochalcone A significantly inhibited poly-IC-induced expression of MCP-1, RANTES, and IL-8. licochalcone A also affects the expression of cytokines involved in asthma. the root of liquorice, G. glabra and G. inflata, has been used to treat various disorders, including bronchial asthma, gastric ulcer, and inflammation. licochalcone A harbors potent anti-inflammatory effects, but the detailed molecular mechanism of such activity has not been explored. beAS 2B cells have a low basal expression of TSLP. this increase was seen at both the mRNA and protein levels. the NF-B transcription factor is a key player in the transactivation of a network of pro-inflammatory genes."}
