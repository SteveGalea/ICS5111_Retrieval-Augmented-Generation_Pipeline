{"summary": "reporting in Saudi Arabia was required for all patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection and a positive real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test result [21] all rRT-PCR\u2013positive cases identified at non-MoH facilities required confirmation at MoH laboratories. February 2015 was a period of increased reporting. interviewees were prompted to describe examples of camel exposures. we also assessed travel history. differences were assessed for significance by using 2, Wilcoxon rank sum. the specimen extract were retested by MERS-CoV N2 and/or N3 rRT-PCR assays [23], and sequencing was attempted on confirmed positive samples. overlapping nested primer sets were used for amplification and Sanger sequencing of the spike genes and selected genomes. the complete genome sequence of each of the viruses in the NRC-2015 clade was aligned with the genomes outside the clade. the multiple sequence alignment was imported into the RDP software for detection of putative recombination events. the software uses several algorithms, including GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq. all rRT-PCR\u2013positive cases identified at non-MoH facilities required confirmation at moH laboratories. for this analysis, we included only individuals who met the case definition described above. this included all cases meeting the case definition as described above. data were analyzed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) reporting in Saudi Arabia was required for all patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection and a positive real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test result [21] onset, (3) visited any healthcare facility in the 14 days before illness onset, or (4) had direct contact with either another documented case of MERS-CoV or with someone with an acute respiratory illness of unknown cause. interviewees were prompted to describe examples of camel exposures, including direct contact or visiting a live market, slaughterhouse or race where camels were present. Molecular Testing at the CDC Sample aliquots (200\u2013300 L, if available) were extracted on a NucliSens EasyMAG. 100 L of total nucleic acid elutes were recovered. the specimen extract were retested by MERS-CoV N2 and/or N3 rRT-PCR assays. available specimen aliquots (or RNA extracts) tested positive for MERS-CoV by both assays were shipped on dry ice to the CDC (Atlanta, Georgia) available specimen aliquots (200\u2013300 L, if available) were extracted on a NucliSens EasyMAG (BioMerieux), and 100 L of total nucleic acid elutes were recovered. composite likelihood distance estimation and maximum likelihood used general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of -distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + 4 + I) 216 cases from 10 of the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia were reported by the moH. 214 were hospitalized, and 102 (47%) died. most patients were male (161 [75%] and of saudi nationality (147 [68%]) neighbor joining tree bootstrap value supporting NRC-2015 was low (70%) similar tree topologies reproducing NRC-2015 were obtained with the spike gene sequences by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. to more fully characterize NRC-2015, 17 MERS-CoV\u2013positive samples with sufficient available volume were selected for genome sequencing. sequences available on GenBank reproduced NRC-2015 with high support values. recombination analysis on newly available genome sequences from NRC-2015 identified 2 possible recombination events involving sequences from outside the clade as potential minor and major parental strains. the most recent common ancestor of the virus was approximately 0.85 years (95% CI,.45\u20131.34) before sample KT225476.2 (17 June 2015), or August 2014. the proportion of patients identified with NRC-2015 increased steadily over time. 216 cases reported by the moH during 1 January\u201330 June 2015 are included. this map does not include the single sequence from the individual with no recognized symptoms who did not meet the case definition. no viruses belonging to clade A were detected. a2015 depicts clades detected through 30 June 2015. no significant differences in age, sex, rate of mortality, time between onset of symptoms and death, or length of hospital stay among fatal cases.

MCMC analysis was performed on the concatenated coding regions of the genomes grouping within NRC-2015, using BEAST. the most recent common ancestor of the virus was approximately 0.85 years (95% CI,.45\u20131.34) before sample KT225476.2 (17 June 2015), or August 2014. the proportion of patients identified with NRC-2015 increased steadily over time. the duration of circulation of recognized subclades ranged from 16 to 665 days. the longest circulating subclade reported was Riyadh_KKUH-1_2014. 10 of 99 sequenced viruses belonged to Riyadh_KKUH-1_2014. the 87 patients were reported from 35 different healthcare facilities across 7 regions in Saudi Arabia. 17 of these facilities reported 2 cases within the same 14-day period. 77 patients satisfied the case definition for routine reporting. the 87 patients with laboratory-confirmed disease reported during February were also classified according to their reported exposures during the 2 weeks before illness onset. 87 patients with laboratory-confirmed disease reported during February were also classified according to their reported exposures during the 2 weeks before illness onset. 9 were deceased and 2 were too ill to participate in the interview. Sequences were obtained for 9 sporadic cases. 8 (89%) were NRC-2015. the study provides the first nationwide epidemiologic and phylogenetic description of MERS-CoV in humans in Saudi Arabia. it demonstrates the emergence, persistent circulation, and eventual predominance of a recently identified recombinant MERS-CoV clade in humans. this includes viruses detected in the Republic of Korea [31, 32], Thailand (accession number KT225476), and China in 2015 [31, 33]. recombination has been documented among coVs [37] and has been linked to the emergence of more-pathogenic strains of some animal CoVs [38\u201340]. recombination has also been found with the human CoVs HKU1 [41], NL63 [42], OC43 [43], and, more recently, MERS-CoV [44]. genome analysis of human MERS-CoV strains from Saudi Arabia in 2015 and the recent outbreak in south Korea/China [ seventeen of 35 affected facilities in february experienced MERS-CoV infection clusters. 16 of 87 patients in february (18%) were visitors to healthcare facilities. this is similar to the 2014 jeddah outbreak, where 17% of investigated cases were visitors. a lack of clearly defined epidemiologic links highlights the need for ongoing epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance to better understand MERS-CoV transmission. this investigation describes the emergence, persistence, and widespread circulation of a novel recombinant MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia."}
