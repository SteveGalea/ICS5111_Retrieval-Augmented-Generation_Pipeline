ARB has achieved a favorable performance in predicting MHC I and MHC II molecules. the 260/280 ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.0. the endotoxin content from purified plasmid DNA was found below 20 U/ml. the coupling reagent was 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate for all peptides. an excess of 8 eq of each amino acid was used. peptides were precipitated by addition of cold diethyl ether. pooled SARS CoV S peptides (1 g/ml for each) or single peptide (1 g/ml) with anti-mouse CD28 mAb (1 g/ml) were added to cultures. supernatants of cell cultures were collected 72 h later. levels of IFN- were assessed by specific ELISA kit. cells were stained with conjugated mAbs specific for CD4, CD8 and intracellular cytokine IFN- for 20\u20133 0 min at 4\u00b0C in dark. ANN applications have been described for predictions of MHC class I binding peptides and for MHC class II peptides. average relative binding (ARB) is a matrix method, which allows combination of searches involving different peptide sizes and alleles into a single global prediction [19], 21. application of these tools was according to prompt dialog box shown in the website. ELISA and ELISPOT results indicated that the adjacent peptides P50 and P51 possessed the same ability to induce IFN- production. the overlapping sequence between P50 and P51 (N50, KCYGVSATKL) was synthesized. peptide N50 could only induced CD8+ T cells to produce IFN-. es were synthesized and used to stimulate splenocytes from sARS-CoV S DNA vaccine immunized BALB/c mice. the fraction of IFN--producing T cells was determined by ELISPOT (Figure 2A) and the level of IFN- in supernatants was measured by ELISA (Figure 2B). only S370\u2013374 (SATKL) was inactive, likely due to weak affinity to MHC-I. the MHC-binding scores were determined by three peptide-binding prediction methods. predicted binding scores were expressed as IC50 values. binding affinities of all 9 and 10 amino acid peptide stretches in S358\u2013381 were predicted.

Y367 and L374 were important for peptide binding and might serve as the main anchor in this epitope.

FACS was performed to determine expression of IFN- in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. after 4\u20135 h, ELISPOT was performed to determine the percentages of IFN-+ cells in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell population. ELISA detected levels of IFN- in supernatants after 72 h. the IFN- response induced by S365\u2013374 was much stronger than that induced by S367\u2013374 (P 0.05). ELISPOT (A) and ELISA (B) were performed to detect the production of IFN-. \u201c0\u201d represent unstimulated controls. S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was the highest affinity peptide to H-2 Kd. the binding affinities of 9 aa peptides in S358\u2013382 were predicted by computer algorithms. the half time of disassociation from each of these molecules was estimated. the score for S366\u2013374 (CYGVSATKL) was 2880, much higher than for S365\u2013374 and S367\u2013374 (Table 2). The half time of disassociation from each of these molecules was estimated.

C366A and S370A are H-2 Kd restricted epitopes. the peptides of P50 and P51 were synthesized and used to stimulate the splenocytes from immunized mice. ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS results all indicated that N50 contained a main CD8+ T cell epitope. alanine-scanning is the least disruptive to the peptide structure because alanine is uncharged and has the smallest amino acid side group next to glycine. glycine can change the main chain conformation of the protein [31] so individual alanine mutations are preferred to infer the roles of individual amino acid residues. mutants K365A or K365D were as potent as wild type S365\u2013374. residue in this position do not influence the function of S366\u2013374. X-ray crystal lographic analyses of peptide-class I MHC complexes has revealed how the peptide-binding cleft in a given MHC molecule interacts. Vesselin Mitaksov described the crystal structure of the MHC class I protein H2-Kd in complex with the antigenic peptide TYQRTRALV (Flu) derived from an influenza nucleoprotein. they found that Flu residues Tyr P2, ThrP5, and ValP9 were sequestered into the B, C, and F pockets of the Kd groove. in its absence, however, S367\u2013374 could still induce an IFN- response, Y367, S370, and L374 are an optimal H-2 Kd CTL epitope in the SARS CoV S protein. Y367, S370, and L374 are anchors in the epitope. Y367, G368, V369, A371, T372, and K373 may directly interact with TCR on the surface of CD8-T cells."}
