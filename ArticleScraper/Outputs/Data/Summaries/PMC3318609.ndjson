{"summary": "a new family of IFN, type III (IFN-), has been described in several species, including humans, mice, swine, and chickens. type III IFN induces similar antiviral responses but signals through very different receptors. most cell types express IFN-/ receptors as well as the IL-10R subunit of the IFN- receptor. etiological agent is the FMD virus (FMDV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Aphthovirus genus Picornaviridae family. the main natural route of FMDV infection is via aerosol through the upper respiratory tract (1). the use of these vaccines presents limitations that have led the world organization of animal health (OIE) to impose more severe trade restrictions on countries that opt to vaccinate instead of slaughtering animals. an alternative vaccine that overcomes some of the limitations of the commercially available inactivated vaccine has been recently developed. treatment with Ad5-boIFN-3 alone or in combination with Ad5-poIFN- resulted in significant delay (6 days) and reduced severity of FMD when animals were challenged by intradermolingual (IDL) inoculation with FMDV. these results suggest that type III IFN is a potent biotherapeutic against FMDV in cattle. fetal bovine serum supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. replication-defective recombinant Ad5s containing type I IFN, bovine and porcine IFN-, boIFN-3, and vector control Ad5-Blue were produced as previously described (15, 32, 52) cells were washed with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (pH 6) for 5 min, followed by an incubation in cell culture medium for an additional 7 h. results were expressed as log10 PFU/ml of supernatant. animals were held for at least 1 week for acclimatization before the start of experiments. all animals were challenged with 104 BID50 FMDV A24 Cruzeiro by IDL inoculation at 4 sites (100 l/each) clinical signs of FMD were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days postchallenge. two groups were inoculated with either 1.5 1011 PFU/animal of Ad5-boIFN-3 or Ad5-boIFN-3. a third group was inoculated with a combination of 7.5 1010 PFU/animal each of Ad5-boIFN-3 and a control group was inoculated with 4 ml of PBS/animal. the control group was inoculated with 107 BID50 of FMDV O1 Man recombinant human IFN-2A was used as a standard (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) at 24 h after incubation, cells were lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer. CAT expression was determined from the cell extracts using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system using primers and probes previously described. differences in antiviral activities, neutralizing antibodies, and percentages of lymphocytes in blood were analyzed by the Student t test using GraphPad Prism software version V5.04. all cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) containing either 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. replication-defective recombinant Ad5s containing type I IFN, bovine and porcine IFN-, boIFN-3, and vector control Ad5-Blue were produced as previously described. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with FMDV O1 Manisa at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. one hour after the infection, cells were washed with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (pH 6) for 5 min. all animals were challenged with 104 BID50 FMDV A24 Cruzeiro by IDL inoculation at 4 sites (100 l/each) clinical signs of FMD were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days postchallenge. two groups were inoculated with either 1.5 1011 PFU/animal of Ad5-boIFN- or Ad5-boIFN-3. a third group was inoculated with a combination of 7.5 1010 PFU/animal each of Ad5-boIFN-3 and a control group was inoculated with 4 ml of PBS/animal. the control group was inoculated with 107 BID50 of FMDV O1 Man recombinant human IFN-2A was used as a standard (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) at 24 h after incubation, cells were lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer. CAT expression was determined from the cell extracts using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's protocol. gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) the combination of both IFNs did not show a clear additive effect at the tested concentrations. no statistically significant differences were detected when the effects of the various combinations of IFNs were compared to that of each IFN alone. a slightly higher antiviral activity was detected when steer calves were inoculated with Ad5-poIFN- (52), despite the similar antiviral activities measured in bovine and porcine cultured cells (7). the experimental design is described in Materials and Methods. all 3 animals inoculated with only Ad5-boIFN-3 had vesicles only on the tongue. viremia was delayed until 2 to 3 dpc, and viral shedding was delayed until 3 to 4 dpc. IFN-3 (1 1011 PFU), the \u201clow-dose combination\u201d (5 1010 PFU Ad5-poIFN- and 5 1010 PFU Ad5-boIFN-3) were challenged with FMDV A24 Cruzeiro at 24 h posttreatment. the maximum clinical score (bars) is 5. animals inoculated with Ad5-poIFN-3 showed the highest levels of antiviral activity, in a dose-responsive manner. disease was delayed until 6 to 8 dpc, with high clinical scores. we tested the efficacy of Ad5-boIFN-3 in cattle after an aerosol challenge with FMDV. we used the O1 Manisa strain of FMDV because the aerosol method has been well standardized with this serotype (37) animals of the control and Ad5-boIFN- groups were positive for FMDV in blood and nasal swabs by virus isolation at 2 and 3 dpc. none of the animals in the combination group was positive for viremia or viral shedding in nasal swabs at any time point after the challenge. IFN- and 7.5 1010 PFU Ad5-boIFN-3) were aerosol challenged with 107 PFU of FMDV O1 Manisa at 24 h posttreatment. the maximum clinical score (bars) is 5. Viremia (solid lines) and nasal shedding (dashed lines) are expressed as log10 PFU/ml of serum or nasal secretion. the percentage of lymphocytes in total white blood cells decreased by 3 dpc in animals of the control and Ad5-boIFN- groups. this decrease was statistically significant (P 0.05) in the PBS group at 3 and 4 dpc relative to 1 dpc. by 6 dpc, the levels of antiviral activity returned to baseline values (1 dpc) as observed in experiment I, no correlation between the levels of systemic antiviral activity before challenge and the delay of disease observed thereafter was detected. animals treated with Ad5-boIFN-3 showed the lowest levels of systemic antiviral activity at 0 dpc, 24 h after Ad5 inoculation. results were expressed as the group average relative fold induction for each gene at 0, 1 and 2 dpc. at 1 dpi, only the Ad5-IFN-treated groups had upregulation of most of the analyzed ISGs. 0.1 1.6 2.2 3.1 1.6 9.6 2.0 3.6 0.8 IL-28 R 1.0 0.3 1.0 0.4 1.0 0.6 1.4 0.5 1.6 0.5 1.7 0.1 1.0 0.1 0.7 0.0 1.7 0.9 1.6 0.4 2.5 0.6 1.7 0.1 1.0 0.1 0.7 0.0 1.7 0.9 1.6 0.4 2.5 0.6 0.6 1.7 0.4 IL-10 R 1.6 0.3 1.1 0.3 1.1 0.2 1.0 2.4 10.0 3.2 1.4 0.1 24.1 23.7 31.9 5.2 IRF7 7.2 4.3 2.6 1.0 2.7 1.3 4.0 1.1 5.3 5.0 6.1 4.5 11.3 11 0.4 1.3 0.4 2.4 1.8 1.2 0.7 10.5 9.7 5.1 3.0 ISG15 55.6 31.6 12.3 3.3 16.5 2.0 22.7 11.6 10.2 4.8 21.4 1.1 40.8 18.6 7.0 2.1 10.0 2.4 0.5 0.3 9 a RNA was extracted from PBMCs of the animals from experiment II at 0, 1, and 2 days postchallenge with FMDV by aerosol. boIFN-3 displays antiviral activity against FMDV O1 Manisa in vitro. in both cases the antiviral activity of the IFN-3 was dose dependent, and when combined with IFN-, an additive effect was observed (15). isa titer in a dose-dependent manner from 5.5 105 to 2.0 104 PFU/ml. the combination of both IFNs did not show a clear additive effect. no statistically significant differences were detected when the effects of the various combinations of IFNs were compared to that of each IFN alone. a slightly higher antiviral activity was detected when steer calves were inoculated with Ad5-poIFN- (52), despite the similar antiviral activities measured in bovine and porcine cultured cells (7). the experimental design is described in Materials and Methods. all 3 animals inoculated with only Ad5-boIFN-3 had vesicles only on the tongue. one animal did not show clinical signs until day 8. viremia was delayed until 2 to 3 dpc, and viral shedding was delayed until 4 dpc. IDL challenged with 104 BID50 of FMDV A24 Cruzeiro at 24 h posttreatment.
