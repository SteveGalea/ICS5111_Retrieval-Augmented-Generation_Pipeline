{"summary": "crystal structure of nsp10/nsp14 heterodimer was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) the crystal belongs to the space group P212121, with cell dimensions a = 185.97, b = 189.74, c = 195.93, and = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the hinge region is formed by the flexible interdomain loop (\u2018FIDL\u2019) wrapping around the -sheet protruding from the MTase domain (inserted -sheet) the hinge region is formed by the flexible interdomain loop (\u2018FIDL\u2019) wrapping around the -sheet protruding from the MTase domain. the nsp14-Exonuclease domain is an / fold constituted of six -helices and 10 strands, organized into three distinct -sheets. the core of the domain is formed by a central -sheet made up of five antiparallel strands (10, 7, 2, 3, and 4) and surrounded by five helices (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) residues Cys207, Cys210, Cys226, His257, Cys261, His264, and Cys279. Fig. 2. Structure model and topology of nsp14 exonuclease domain. nsp10 Interacts with nsp14, thereby Stabilizing the ExoN Active Site. nsp10/nsp14 interaction surface is of 7,798 2 versus 3,225 2 for nsp16. in the absence of nsp10, residues of the exonuclease domain are correctly positioned and form a highly active ExoN. this distortion indicates that the ExoN catalytic pocket partially collapses in the absence of nsp10. the exoN and N7-MTase domains of nsp14 are separated by a hinge region that allows significant movements between both domains. the hinge is composed of a flexible interdomain loop (residues F286\u2013G300) wrapping around a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet jutting out of the N7-MTase domain. the nsp14 N7-MTase domain comprises a total of 12 -strands and five -helices. the fold presents a central five-stranded -sheet made up of four parallel strands. the central sheet is sandwiched between a single -helix (7) and three long loops punctuated by two small helices. a long, disordered region (residues 453\u2013465) not built in our structural model separates the two strands. between the tip of strand 21 and the bottom of helix 9, a third zinc-binding site is found. the zinc finger constrains the structure locally and orients 9 toward the center of the structure. two landmarks of the Rossmann fold family are the first structural feature. the motif sequence G-x-G-(x)n-G constitutes the NTP-binding site. the most conserved feature of the Rossmann fold family, the structural motif, is absent. the first 71 amino acids of nsp14 are not essential for interaction with nsp12-RdRp. the nsp14-ExoN catalytic site mutant (D90A/E92A) was included in the study. -MTase domain (Y296, P297, C473, T475, H487, L495, and Y498) are essential for ExoN activity. nsp14 Y498A mutant conserves an N7-MTase activity in the same range as nsp14 wt (95% 6) nsp14 Y498A mutant exhibits substantially reduced N7-MTase activity (14% 2.5) DENV NS5 does not significantly misincorporate nucleotides, even with up to 8 mM UTP, ATP, or CTP. this observation is in line with DENV RdRp fidelity, estimated between 1/34,000 and 1/135,000. reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. conditions of enzyme purification and polymerase assay described by potisopon et al. the presence of nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN promotes A-to-U repair of 90% of sequenced clones. that of nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN() leaves 94% of sequenced clones unrepaired (P 0.001) part of the primer is shown with the same color code as the sequencing of the extended primer presented in C. dsRNA product degradations by nsp14-ExoN activity may not have biological significance, since replication is uncoupled from excision in the present pathway. a synthetic RNA primer showed an Rbv monophosphate at its 3\u2032 end (named LS2-Rbv) annealed to the RNA template LS15. this RNA substrate was first tested with a high concentration of nsp14 alone. the addition of increasing concentrations of nsp10 stimulates the excision rate. data were found to fit best to the classic Michaelis\u2013Menten equation. GraphPad Prism software, the Rbv-TP Km value is 136 M, while the GTP Km value is 1.5 M. incorporated Rbv can be readily excised by nsp10/nsp14-ExoN and, to a lesser extent, by nsp14-ExoN alone. this observation may account for the poor efficacy of Rbv against SARS-CoV in infected patients (10). ribbon structure of nsp14 shown as colored subdomains: cyan (nsp10-binding site), orange (exonuclease), gray (flexible linker or hinge), and purple (N7-MTase). terminal extremities are indicated by the letters N and C (black) the nsp14-Exonuclease domain is an / fold constituted of six -helices and 10 strands, organized into three distinct -sheets. the core of the domain is formed by a central -sheet made up of five antiparallel strands (10, 7, 2, 3, and 4) and surrounded by five helices (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) the third antiparallel -sheet grows out of the base of the central core domain between 4 and 10. it presents at its base a first zinc finger motif comprising residues Cys207, Cys210, Cys226, and His229. a second zinc finger located between 5 and 6 is formed by residues His257, Cys261, His264, and Cys279. nsp14 is a flexible N terminus region of nsp14 (residues 1\u201350), 1 (residues 51\u201355), and an antiparallel -strand. the palm is constituted by top and side (residues 55\u201369 and 195\u2013202) of the ExoN domain. nsp10/nsp14 interaction surface is of 7,798 2 versus 3,225 2 for ns the hinge is composed of a flexible interdomain loop (residues F286\u2013G300) wrapping around a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet. the hinge is composed of a flexible interdomain loop (residues F286\u2013G300) jutting out of the N7-MTase domain. the nsp14 N7-MTase domain comprises a total of 12 -strands and five -helices. the fold presents a central five-stranded -sheet made up of four parallel strands. the central -sheet is sandwiched between a single -helix (7) and three long loops punctuated by two small helices. the central sheet is surrounded by two strands (13 and 19) between 15 and the second turn, 3 is inserted into the -sheet of the hinge (discussed above), which forms a lid above the active site. a long, disordered region (residues 453\u2013465) not built in our structural model separates the two strands, and we postulate that it may serve as a binding platform for other partners. the Rossmann fold can be described as a seven-stranded -sheet with at least three parallel -helices on each side (/ fold) two landmarks of the fold family are the first structural feature, and the motif sequence G-x-G-(x)n-G, which constitute the NTP-binding site. the interaction surface between nsp10 and nsp14 has been mapped using mutagenesis (45) and structural studies. the structural basis of the interaction between nsp14 and nsp14 is still unresolved. seven residues in the nsp14 N7-MTase domain (Y296, P297, C473, T475, H487, L495, and Y498) are essential for ExoN activity. nsp14 Y498A mutant conserves an N7-MTase activity in the same range as nsp14 wt (95% 6) sp12/nsp8/nsp8/nsp7 and dengue virus NS5 incorporated nucleotide into RNA. both polymerases incorporate GMP (corresponding to the \u201ccorrect\u201d Watson\u2013Crick base pair) efficiently into this RNA. the two polymerases exhibit strikingly different fidelity. single-nucleotide primer extension with the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (0.5 M), LS2*/LS15 (0.5 M), and increasing concentrations of the indicated NTP. reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. conditions of enzyme purification and polymerase assay described by potisopon et al. the presence of nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN promotes A-to-U repair of 90% of sequenced clones. nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN() leaves 94% of sequenced clones unrepaired. dsRNA products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. the positions of the primer (20-mer) and the full-length extension product (40-mer) are indicated. dsRNA product degradations by nsp14-ExoN activity may not have biological significance. Rbv 5\u2032-monophosphate (Rbv) is incorporated into RNA, preferentially opposite template pyrimidines (UMP or CMP), around 100-fold less efficiently than a regular Watson\u2013Crick base pair. a synthetic RNA primer exhibiting an Rbv monophosphate at its 3\u2032 end (named LS2-Rbv) annealed to the RNA template LS15, resulting in Rbv opposite CMP. single-Rbv primer extension products were quantified using LS2/LS15, LS2/LS1, LS2/LS17, and LS2/LS16 as the primer/template. data were fitted to a single exponential equation. incorporated Rbv can be readily excised by nsp10/nsp14-ExoN and, to a lesser extent, by nsp14-ExoN alone. this observation may account for the poor efficacy of Rbv against SARS-CoV in infected patients. the acquisition and evolution of the nsp14 gene present striking features, providing structural and functional evidence that it is at a tipping point in the evolution of genetic stability during viral replication. the nsp14 gene most likely results from a de novo emergence and not from a gene duplication. nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity may be involved in the degradation of immune stimulatory dsRNA. nsp14 is directly involved in at least two processes that use two different kinds of RNA substrates. nsp14 is directly involved in at least two processes that use two different kinds of RNA substrates. two conserved residues (Y296 and P297) located in the hinge of nsp14 are essential for the ExoN activity. these structural data combining structure and flexibility strengthen the unique feature of CoV nsp14. the origin and fate of nidovirus nsp14 sequences, structures, and activities may be significantly informative in the history of RNA-to-DNA genome evolutions. the conservation of nsp10, nsp12, and nsp14 across the CoV genus suggests that our finding may well apply to many members of the Coronaviridae family. nsp14-coding sequence was cloned into expression vector pDEST14 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to produce a recombinant protein carrying an N terminus His6-tag (18). site-directed mutagenesis to generate plasmids expressing nsp14 mutants was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. crystals were cryoprotected with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M trisodium citrate (pH 5.5), 8% PEG 8000, and 30% hexanediol. the MAD data were collected to 3.5 resolution at the peak ( = 1.28242) and inflection ( = 1.28282 ) wavelengths for zinc. LS2, LS2-Rbv, and LS3 were radiolabeled with the T4 polynucleotide kinase. LS2* was then annealed to either LS1, LS15, LS16, or LS17. LS3* was annealed to LS8 by heating at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min and then cooling down to room temperature. RNA polymerization products were analyzed in polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels. cDNA Clones from newly polymerized RNA Products were excised and electroeluted. RT was performed with a forward primer (5\u2032-GTATCCCCATCATTTTA-3\u2032) nsp12-RdRp was tagged with eight histidines. a second chromatography step was performed on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 column. site-directed mutagenesis to generate plasmids expressing nsp14 mutants was performed. the MAD data were collected to 3.5 resolution at the peak ( = 1.28242 ) and inflection ( = 1.28282 ) wavelengths for zinc. higher resolution (3.38 ) data were collected from a single crystal of the native complex. auto-building with Buccaneer (54) was useful to extend the model. LS2* was then annealed to either LS1, LS15, LS16, or LS17. LS2-Rbv* was then annealed to LS8 by heating at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. all polymerase reactions were preincubated for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C. cDNA Clones from newly polymerized RNA Products were excised and electroeluted using a GEBAFLEX extraction kit. RT was performed with a forward primer (5\u2032-GTATCCCCATCATCATTTTA-3\u2032) after heating to 95 \u00b0C."}
