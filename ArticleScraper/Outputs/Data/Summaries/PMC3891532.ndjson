{"summary": "porcine torovirus (BToV) is a member of the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) it was reported to be related to calf diarrhea in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves and under field conditions. in 1982, bovine torovirus (BToV) was first isolated from a case of neonatal calf diarrhea in the united states. Specimens collection 168 samples of feces or intestines from piglets that died of severe diarrhea from 20 farms in southwest china were collected during the winter of 2011. most of the sampled piglets were one to three weeks old and antibiotic treatment was invalid in all sampled piglets. RT-PCR and nested PCR primers were used in this study. target virusesa Target genesb Primer sequence, 5\u2032\u20133\u2032c Size (bp) Source or reference PToV S F: ACCCCTGCCTGAGGTTTCYTT R: CATATGCAGCCTRCGTGTGT 451 Established by our own laboratory PRV A VP6 F: AAAGATGCTAGGGACAAAATTG R: TTCAGATTACCAATTCCA 308 Elschner aPEDV: porcine epidemic coronavirus; PKBV: porcine kobuvirus; PRV A\u2013C: porcine group A\u2013C rotaviruses; TGEV: transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus; AV: astroviruses; MRV: mammalian orthoreovirus; PNoV: porcine norovirus. bORF: S: spike protein; 3D: RNA dependent RNA poly PCR products were purified and used for sequencing. the purposed band, about 450 bp, was excised and then purified. the resulting products were cloned into pMDT-19 simple vector (Takara) the mixture was diluted in 2 volume (wt/vol) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min. total RNA of supernatants were extracted using TaKaRa RNAiso Reagent and dissolved in DEPC treated water.

KC340952 (farm numbers 1 and 2); KC340953 (farm number 7); KC340954 (farm numbers 8 and 8). for 9 farms positive for PToV, the RT-PCR yielded a product of the anticipated size of 451 bp. pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene confirmed that the strains are more closely related to the porcine torovirus. gene sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method. the phylogenetic tree was performed by the neighbour joining method using 1000 bootstrap. in china, PToV-associated diarrhea has not been reported. poTV."}
