{"summary": "HCoV-HKU1 S protein activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) it is not understood whether HCoV-HKU1 S protein has similar activity. both S proteins were found in the endoplasmic reticulum. coronaviruses have developed strategies to modulate signal transduction pathways that govern ER function. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus spike (S) proteins induce ER stress and activate cellular unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER. all three branches of the UPR are governed by ER-resident transmembrane proteins ATF6, IRE1 and PERK respectively. HCoV-HKU1 is a betacoronavirus initially identified in 2005 from a patient with community-acquired pneumonia. but molecular and cellular pathogenesis of HCoV-HKU1 in contrast to SARS-CoV remains elusive. activity of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins may shed new light on their roles in coronavirus-host interaction. we compared the UPR-activating activity of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins in terms of their influence on the expression of UPR effectors. pLenti-SCV-S and pLenti-HKU1-S constructs expressing V5-tagged SARS-CoV S protein (SCV-S) and HCoV-HKU1 S protein (HKU1-S), respectively. cells in the control group received empty p-Lenti vector only. the action of TMPRSS2 on SARS-CoV S protein was highly specific. TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS4 had no activity under the same condition. HCoV-HKU1 S protein is not processed by TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4. luciferase reporter plasmid pGrp78-Luc (A), pGrp94-Luc (B), pCHOP-Luc (C) or pUPRE-Luc (D) cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection for dual luciferase assay. PERK is a protein kinase that controls the expression of many UPR effector genes including Grp78 and Grp94 [17,46,47]. PERK activity is required for transcriptional activation of grp78 and Grp94 promoters by S proteins. PERK-WT and PERK-DN exert opposite effects on activation of grp78 and Grp94 promoters by S proteins from both viruses. ten major N-linked glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV S protein and nine sites in HCoV-HKU1 S protein were chosen for further analysis. compared to wild-type proteins, these mutants were equally competent in the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters. to remove N-linked glycans, cell lysates were incubated with endoglycosidase PNGase F. cell lysates were incubated with endoglycosidase PNGase F for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. luciferase reporter expression driven by grp78 and grp94 promoters. KU1 was able to activate luciferase reporter expression. luciferase reporter expression was driven by luciferase reporter expression. truncated mutants were expressed in 293FT cells. expression, localization and cleavage of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins. both western blotting (Figure 1A) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 1B) indicated effective expression of both proteins to similar levels. TMPRSS2 and related proteases TMPRSS4 activate HCoV-HKU1 S protein. cleavage of HCoV-HKU1 S protein was not affected. TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS4 had no activity under same condition. 293FT cells were cotransfected with TMPRSS1/4/2 and V5-tagged S proteins. Western blotting was performed with anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibodies. luciferase activity normalized to those of Renilla luciferase activity. activity recovered from cells transfected with pLenti vector alone was set as 1. there is no statistically significant difference between groups -gal and SCV-S or between groups -gal and HKU1-S. PERK-WT and PERK-DN exert opposite effects on the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters by S proteins from both viruses. PERK-WT exerted opposite effects on the activation of grp78 and Grp94 promoters by S proteins from both viruses. ten major N-linked glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV S protein and nine sites in HCoV-HKU1 S protein were chosen for further analysis. compared to the wild-type proteins, these mutants were equally competent in the activation of Grp78 and Grp94 promoters. this indicates their deficiency in N-linked glycosylation. the processing of HCoV-HKU1 S protein is not mediated by TMPRSS2 protease. to determine whether the UPR-activating property of SARS-CoV S protein is mediated by S1 (amino acids 1\u2013770) or S2 (amino acids 771\u20131255) subunit, we expressed them in 293FT cells. 2 truncated mutants were expressed in 293FT cells. luciferase reporter expression driven by grp78 and grp94 promoters. luciferase reporter expression was activated in escalating doses. TMPRSS2 protease is capable of cleaving SARS-CoV S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, but has no proteolytic activity on HCoV-HKU1 S protein. this adds HCoV-HKU1 to the list of coronaviruses including MHV, which use S protein to modulate the UPR. HCoV-HKU1 S protein might use one part of S1 and another part of S2 to perform its function in UPR modulation. further experiments are required to define the UPR-activating domain in HCoV-HKU1 S protein. a recombinant lentivirus pseudotyped with HCoV-HKU1 S protein can also be used to study the roles of S protein in viral entry and pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 protease was capable of cleaving SARS-CoV S protein, but not HCoV-HKU1 S protein, into S1 and S1 subunits. inhibition of PERK kinase has been found to inhibit cytomegalovirus replication [56], activation of the UPR with a small-molecule compound also has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. pCHOP-Luc and pGRP94-Luc were gifts from Kazutoshi Mori [40,58] Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were carried out as described. control plasmid pRLSV40 expressing Renilla luciferase (Promega) was cotransfected into cells and firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. plasmids pGRP78-Luc and pGRP94-Luc were gifts from Kazutoshi Mori. both promoters harbor multiple copies of ER stress response element. pUPRE-Luc reporter plasmid has been described elsewhere. confocal microscopy was performed on LSM510 (Carl-Zeiss) as described [60,61]. cells were transfected with an S-expressing plasmid and pDsRed-ER (Clontech) for 36 h. cells were then fixed and stained with anti-V5 antibody.
