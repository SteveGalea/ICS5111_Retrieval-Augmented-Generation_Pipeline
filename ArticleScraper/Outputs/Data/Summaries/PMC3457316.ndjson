RRV-specific antibody titers in sera of WT and TLR7/ infected mice were first determined by ELISA. inactivated RRV (1 g/ml) was then plated on high-binding 96-well plates for 12 to 24 h. serum was diluted in antibody diluent and then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. the mice were subcutaneously infected in the left rear footpad with 103 PFU of RRV. at 1 h after serum transfer, the mice were monitored daily for weight loss and disease signs. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to subcutaneous inoculation in the left rear footpad with 103 PFU of virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) diluent in a 10-l volume. disease scores were determined by assessing grip strength, hind limb weakness, and altered gait. mice were sacrificed and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.3. excised tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-m sections were prepared. serum was extracted prior to freezing at 80\u00b0C. a score of 0 to 3 represents no to mild inflammation or damage, 4 to 6 represents moderate inflammation or damage, and 7 to 10 represents severe inflammation or damage. spleen tissues from WT and TLR7/ mice were stained with H&E. stained sections were blinded and scored for the number of GCs and the number of total follicles within the section. monocyte staining panel included antibodies anti-NK1.1\u2013phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD3\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-B220\u2013PE Texas Red (PETR), anti-LCA\u2013PECy5 (eBioscience), anti-F4/80\u2013PECy7 (eBioscience), anti-CD4\u2013Pacific blue (PB), anti-CD8\u2013Pacific orange (PB), anti-CD8\u2013PECy7 the SigLecF+ subpopulation is displayed on a histogram of CD11b versus CD11c. eosinophils appear as a CD11b-high, CD11c-low group. the remaining CD11c-positive cells are displayed on a plot of MHC class II versus CD11b. samples were diluted 1:5 in MEM, acidified to a pH of 2.0 for 24 h. then neutralized to pH 7.4. encephalomyocarditis virus was added to each well at a multiplicity of infection. the samples were incubated on the cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. the cells were overlaid with an agar overlay solution consisting of 50% 2.5% CMC (Sigma), 50% 2 modified Eagle medium, 3% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine and 1% 1 M HEPES buffer. RRV-specific antibody titers in sera of WT and TLR7/ infected mice were first determined by ELISA. serum was then plated on high-binding 96-well plates for 12 to 24 h. serum was diluted in antibody diluent (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 10% Sigma Block) and then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. data were analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student t test. percent starting weights for WT, TLR7/, and Myd88/ mice were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance. RRV-infected mice lost weight between days 6 and 10 postinfection. myd88/ mice showed a similar disease progression but lost more weight. 100% of myd88/ mice were moribund by day 10 postinfection and had to be euthanized. studies initially focused on TLR7, a Myd88-dependent TLR known to play a role in the antiviral response against multiple viruses. RRV-infected mice lost weight between 7 and 10 days postinfection. TLR7/ mice became moribund by day 10 postinfection. skeletal muscle is a targeted tissue for viral replication, inflammation, and tissue destruction following RRV infection. skeletal muscle is a targeted tissue for viral replication, inflammation, and tissue destruction following RRV infection (37\u201339) blind scoring of overall inflammatory cell infiltration and damage observed in RRV-infected WT and Myd88/ muscle tissue. the results of the blind scoring analyses showed that while WT and TLR7/ mice showed similar levels of inflammatory cell infiltration in skeletal muscle tissue following RRV infection, there was significantly more damage in the quadriceps tissue of TLR7/ mice. previous studies have shown that inflammatory macrophages play a major role in promoting RRV-induced disease (21, 30, 31). at 5 and 7 days postinfection, WT and TLR7/ mice showed similar numbers of inflammatory leukocyte cells in RRV-infected quadriceps tissues. mice were subcutaneously infected with 103 PFU of RRV. at 5 and 7 days postinfection, mice were sacrificed and perfused with 1 PBS. type I IFN production in sera of TLR7/ and Myd88/ mice is similar to that in sera of mice early during RRV infection. twenty-four-day-old mice were subcutaneously infected in the left rear footpad with 103 PFU of RRV. iters in the sera of TLR7/ mice were significantly enhanced over those in WT mice at day 3 postinfection. analysis of the viral burden in infected quadriceps tissues revealed that TLR7/ mice had significantly higher viral titers than WT mice at day 5 and 7 postinfection. similar results were found in myd88-deficient mice (Fig. 5A and C) twenty-four-day-old mice were subcutaneously infected with 103 PFU of RRV. at the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed by exsanguination. at the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed by exsanguination. analysis of RRV-specific IgG subtypes revealed that TLR7/ mice showed significantly increased total RRV-specific IgG at day 7 postinfection. TLR7/ mice showed significantly increased total RRV-specific IgG1 and IgG2c antibody production at 7 days postinfection. mice were tested for RRV neutralization activity using PRNT assay. antibody titers are expressed as the inverse of the dilution. 50% of the virus present was neutralized for a given sample. d by exsanguination and serum antibody levels were measured by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. n = 4 (WT) or 6 (TLR7/) mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 50 l of heat-inactivated sera from RRV-infected mice harvested at day 10 postinfection. myd88 and TLR7 deficiency alters germinal center development following RRV infection. GC B cells are critical for antibody affinity maturation and for the development of class-switched neutralizing antibodies. spleens were excised and paraffin embedded, and 5-m tissue sections stained with H&E. blind scoring of germinal centers (GCs) per follicle observed in WT and TLR7/ spleens. mice deficient in Myd88 were highly susceptible to RRV-induced disease. myd88/ mice developed more severe disease signs than wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J animals. RRV-infected mice lost weight between days 6 and 10 postinfection. TLR7-deficient mice exhibit a phenotype identical to that of Myd88-deficient animals. Myd88 operates as an essential adaptor molecule for most TLRs. it can also serve as an adaptor for interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18 receptor signaling. TLR7- and Myd88-deficient mice were sacrificed at 10 days postinfection. skeletal muscle is a targeted tissue for viral replication, inflammation, and tissue destruction following RRV infection. TLR7- and Myd88-deficient mice showed enhanced tissue damage. quadriceps muscles were excised and paraffin embedded. 5-m tissue sections were stained with H&E. blind scoring of overall inflammatory cell infiltration and damage observed in RRV-infected WT and TLR7/ muscle tissue. TLR7 deficiency does not affect macrophage recruitment but does affect T cell recruitment into RRV-infected muscle tissue. previous studies have shown that inflammatory macrophages play a major role in promoting RRV-induced disease. inflammatory cell recruitment is similar in WT and TLR7/ mice following RRV infection. twenty-four-day-old mice were subcutaneously infected with 103 PFU of RRV. at 5 and 7 days postinfection, mice were sacrificed and perfused with 1 PBS. type I IFN production in sera of TLR7/ and Myd88/ mice is similar to that in sera of mice early during infection. no significant differences in viral titer were detected in mice lacking TLR7 or Myd88 at various times after RRV infection. WT and TLR7/ mice did not show significant differences in viral titer in the quadriceps muscles by plaque assay at days 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 postinfection. however, viral titers in the sera of TLR7/ mice were significantly enhanced over those in WT mice at day 3 postinfection. we observed no differences in viral load within the brains and spinal cords of WT and TLR7/ mice at 1 and 2 days postinfection. we also observed no differences in viral titer in the kidneys, livers, spleens, and draining lymph nodes between WT and TLR7/ mice at 1 and 2 days postinfection. we hypothesized that deficiency in TLR7 signaling may result in an ineffective antibody response that leads to an ineffective TLR7/ mice showed increased RRV-specific total IgG production at 7 and 10 days postinfection compared with WT animals. TLR7/ mice showed significantly increased total RRV-specific IgG production at 7 and 10 days postinfection. total RRV-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies in RRV-infected mice at day 7 (A) and day 10 (B) are shown. at 7 and 10 days postinfection, mice were sacrificed by exsanguination and sera from RRV-infected mice was tested for RRV neutralization activity using PRNT assay. twenty-four-day-old mice were subcutaneously infected with 103 PFU of RRV. serum antibody levels were measured by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. levels of total IgG were measured in presence of increasing concentrations of NaSCN. WT mice that received sera from RRV-infected TLR7/ mice showed significantly reduced weight gain and enhanced disease signs between days 5 and 10 postinfection. myd88 and TLR7 deficiency alters germinal center development following RRV infection. TLR7/ mice show reduced germinal center formation following RRV infection. twenty-four-day-old WT and myd88/ mice were subcutaneously infected in the left footpad with 103 PFU of RRV. mice were sacrificed and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. studies show that TLR7 and its adaptor molecule, Myd88, mediate protection against severe RRV-induced disease and mortality. both TLR7- and Myd88-deficient mice showed reduced germinal center formation and reduced GL7+ B cells compared to those of WT animals following RRV infection. findings provide new insights into the role that TLR7 plays in alphavirus pathogenesis by highlighting the importance of this pathway. we found no evidence that systemic type I IFN responses were decreased in TLR7- and Myd88-deficient animals at early times postinfection. however, we did see significant defects in the ability of both TLR7- and Myd88-deficient animals to control RRV replication at late times postinfection. however, the virus-specific antibody that was produced showed little neutralizing activity and showed less affinity for RRV than WT antibody. inflammatory cell recruitment was not due to a general defect in inflammatory cell recruitment in the TLR7/ mice. findings provide further evidence that myd88-dependent TLR7 signaling plays a role in regulating multiple aspects of the host adaptive immune response. enhancing TLR7-mediated responses may be beneficial during vaccination against RRV or other alphaviruses. we found no defect in the ability of pDCs isolated from TLR7-deficient mice to produce type I IFN in response to RRV infection in vitro. however, it is possible that pDCs lacking TLR7 may have other functional defects during RRV infection that we have not yet discovered. a recent study demonstrated the importance of myd88-dependent TLR7 signaling in B cells for the development of effective neutralizing antibody production during alphavirus infection. a similar outcome has been found with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination. lack of protective anti-RSV response within the lungs leads to vaccine-induced immune pathology. RRV-mediated inflammatory disease has previously been shown to be mediated by complement activation in a mouse model of infection. Id88-dependent TLR7 signaling enhances myd88-dependent TLR7 signaling. further studies will be necessary to elucidate mechanism of TLR7-mediated protection from severe RRV-induced disease."}
