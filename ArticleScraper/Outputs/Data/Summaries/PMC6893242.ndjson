{"summary": "the nucleotide sequence that forms any gene is translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence. this sequence becomes functional only when it adopts its tertiary structure. experimental methods such as X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance are considered authoritative ways for obtaining proteins' structure and function. a new alignment-free method for protein sequences is introduced. each amino acid in the protein sequence is represented by a number. the graphical representation eliminates degeneracy and has no loss of information. no.
