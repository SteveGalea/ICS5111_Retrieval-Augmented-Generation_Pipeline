{"summary": "the first identification of EVD was in 1976 during two separate large outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly known as Zaire) and Sudan. two distinct species of Ebolavirus, EBOV and Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have since been the major species responsible for most subsequent EVD outbreaks. real-time reverse transcription-PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assays are able to detect viral RNA in blood specimens. they are the most suitable diagnostic tests at the early stages of disease due to the presence of high titers of virus in blood. false-negative or false-positive results are critical, as such errors will cause delays in the initiation of appropriate public health measures. the PT program was developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in biosecurity. it offers PT in the absence of inactivated EBOV, using simulated EBOV specimens that are safe to handle and stable after storage. this is also the first time such a program has been documented. lyophilized simulated EBOV specimen was not significantly degraded over the course of a 2-week short-term storage, i.e., a week at ambient temperature followed by another week at 80\u00b0C. lyophilized specimens with short-term (2-week) storage appeared to be stable, with no significant decrease in the relative number of GE copies/ml of each in vitro RNA transcript in the simulated specimen. the EBOV proficiency testing program was offered to a total of 10 participating laboratories. the participation increased in the second PT program within the same year. the most recent EBOV PT was offered in March 2016. performance for the detection and identification of EBOV was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. the results for both specimens included in the PT panels were NP, GP, and L. in the first (April 2014) and third (March 2016) EBOV PTs, all laboratories correctly reported the presence of EBOV in item 1. the simulated EBOV specimen was not significantly degraded over the course of a 2-week short-term storage. there was no significant decrease in the relative number of GE copies/ml for each in vitro RNA transcript. lyophilized specimens with short-term (2-week) storage appeared to be stable. the variation of data (mean SD) was from five randomly selected replicates (n = 5) and three randomly selected replicates (n = 3) (two-week stability) of the simulated EBOV specimen, prepared at an average of approximately 1.0 108 GE copies/ml. the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance (P 0.05). a result from a second EBOV-specific NAT assay was reported. a result from a second EBOV-specific NAT assay was reported. the results were qualitatively and quantitatively. laboratories used an in-house assay, except for one laboratory (participant 3). another used a commercial kit, the RealStar Ebolavirus RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics GmbH), in the second EBOV PT. all protocols used by participating laboratories detected a minimum of one and a maximum of three EBOV-specific gene targets (Table 1). a stable PT specimen will ensure reproducibility of the virus-specific gene testing performed by the participating laboratories. the stability of the simulated EBOV specimen was not compromised following long-term (1-year at 80\u00b0C) and short-term (a week at ambient temperature, followed by another week at 80\u00b0C) storage conditions for samples during handling and transportation may affect the stability of the target nucleic acid. lyophilized RNA virus (five different strains of influenza virus) was found to be more stable than fluid virus preparation indefinitely at or below room temperature. lyophilization of another RNA virus preserved the virus at ambient temperature or at +4\u00b0C (20) a simulated EBOV specimen can still be prepared using EBOV-specific in vitro RNA transcripts. the EBOV gene fragments were determined using the complete genome sequence of EBOV (GenBank accession number AF086833.2) as a reference. the fragments consisted of a 1,406-nucleotide region upstream of the NP gene covering nucleotides at positions 518 to 1923, 500 nucleotides of the first GP gene at positions 7361 to 7860, a second GP gene region consisting of 873 nucle ligation reaction mixture consisted of 2 l of 5 Express Link T4 DNA ligase buffer (Invitrogen), 1 l of pCRII vector (25 ng/l), 4 l of nuclease-free water, and 1 l of ExpressLink T4 DNA ligase (5 units) the ligated product was transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (-Select Bronze Efficiency; Bioline) according to the manufacturer's protocol the simulated specimen was subjected to RNA extraction using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) the RNA was subjected to a one-step real-time RT-PCR mixture. a 25-l RT-PCR mixture was set up, containing 5 l of the extracted RNA, 12.5 l of 2 reaction buffer provided with the AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR reagents. EBOV-NP-Fwd (GCCAACGATGCTGTGATTTC), EBOV-NP-Rev (GGAGACGAACTCCTCGTTCTG), EBOV-GP1-Rev (CTGCTGGCACTCTCTCTTCTCC), EBOV-GP2-Rev (CTTTGTG/ideoxyI/ACATA/ideoxyI/CGGCAC), and EBOV-L-Rev (ACTGTGGCATGTTCACCAAAA) simulated EBOV specimen was resuspended in 500 l nuclease-free, sterile 1 phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) the remaining seven replicates were stored at ambient temperature (21 to 23\u00b0C) for a week, followed by 1 week of storage at 80\u00b0C. the stability of the simulated EBOV specimen was determined by comparing the relative number of GE copies/ml pre- and poststorage. two specimens included one simulated EBOV specimen containing a mixture of EBOV-specific in vitro RNA transcripts (item 1) and a negative sample containing only nucleotide-free water (item 2). Specimens were provided either as 500 l of the frozen form dispatched to the participating laboratories on dry ice (in April and November 2014) or in lyophilized form dispatched at ambient temperature (March 2016). gBlocks gene fragments were synthesized into a series of four double-stranded, sequence-verified genomic blocks (gBlocks gene fragments; Integrated DNA Technologies) these fragments were synthesized into a series of four double-stranded, sequence-verified genomic blocks (gBlocks gene fragments; Integrated DNA Technologies) the design of the EBOV-specific gene fragments was based on the complete genome sequence of EBOV (GenBank accession number the ligated product was transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli cells. the recombinant plasmid DNA was sequence verified and linearized. the digested, linear plasmid DNA was transcribed in vitro into RNA the using MEGAscript T7 kit or MEGAscript SP6 kit. a 25-l RT-PCR mixture was set up, containing 5 l of the extracted RNA, 12.5 l of 2 reaction buffer provided with the AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR reagents. all oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. thermal cycling involved 45\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s. EBOV-GP1-Rev (CTGCTGGCACTCTCTTCTCC), EBOV-GP2-Rev (CTTTGTG/ideoxyI/TGCTACAATC), EBOV-L-Fwd (GTTACGGAACGTGAGCAAAA), and EBOV-L-Rev (ACTGTGGCATGTTCACCAAAA) the remaining 15 samples were then stored at 80\u00b0C. one year later, another five samples were randomly selected, subjecte the stability of the simulated EBOV specimen was determined by comparing the relative number of GE copies/ml of the specimen pre- and poststorage. the differences of the relative numbers of GE copies/ml in the specimen pre- and poststorage are shown as mean standard deviation (SD) the participating laboratories in the third round of PT (March 2016) were asked to resuspend lyophilized specimens in 500 l of nuclease-free, sterile 1 phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) Laboratories were instructed to perform RNA extraction and subsequent NAT as they would normally do to identify the organism."}
