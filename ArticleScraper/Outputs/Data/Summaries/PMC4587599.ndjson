IL-1 and IL-8, defensins, antiproteases (46, 84, 188) Epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils (41, 51, 147) Metal endopeptidases with conserved zinc binding site Neutrophil-derived proteases (NE, cathepsin G, proteinase 3) Elastin, collagen, fibronectin cathepsins have been linked to respiratory virus infection since cathepsin L cleaves and activates the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) cathepsin B is induced during IAV infection in mice (20, 27) TTSPs are a family of proteases that possess an NH2-terminal transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a COOH-terminal serine protease domain. protease activity is attained through the nucleophilic serine, which attacks the substrate's carbonyl functional group. TTSPs are synthesized as a single-chain, inactive proenzyme and require cleavage following a basic arginine hepsin/transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) subfamily contains hepsin, TMPRSS2-5 and 13, mosaic serine protease large-form, and enteropeptidase; the corin protease; and the matriptase subfamily that includes matriptase 1\u20133 and polyserase-1 (5). TTSPs are transmembrane proteases, but release in sputum samples from patients with chronic airway disorders, secreted HAT levels are elevated (189) in sputum samples from patients with chronic airway disorders such as bronchitis or asthma, secreted HAT levels are elevated. TMPRSS2 cleaves the monobasic site of the HA protein required for HA activation. titers in TMPRSS2-deficient mice were significantly reduced compared with wild-type animals. TMPRSS2 knockout mice were protected from lethal H1N1 but not lethal H3N2 infection. despite these differences, there is substantial evidence implicating TTSPs in IAV pathogenesis. activity of respiratory antiproteases in the Lung Activity TIMPs MMPs (24) Alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, granulocytes (28, 97) Insert reactive ridge NH2-terminal domain into MMP active site, inhibit apoptosis (103, 120) Serpin Serine and cysteine proteases, caspases, bacteria, viruses. TIMPs inhibit MMP activity through the formation of an NH2-terminal reactive ridge domain that inserts into the active site of the target MMP (24, 103). the TIMP family share about 40% homology and have overlapping anti-MMP activity. serpins form long, flexible reactive center loops that insert into the protease active site. this action leads to the permanent deactivation of both serpin and protease, often described as a \u201csuicide\u201d event. TTSP activity in the context of IAV infections depends on amino acid sequence, protein structure, and/or HA substrate accessibility. plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), encoded by SerpinE1, inhibited HA cleavage and reduced infectivity of progeny virions. protease/antiprotease balances may be important mucosal regulators of IAV spreading. recombinant elafin was protective during HIV infection only when elafin was preincubated with HIV. secreted elafin levels were elevated in the cervicovaginal lavages of HIV-negative women compared with HIV-positive women. after HRV infection, elafin is downregulated in subjects with COPD (113). SLPI exerts cellular anti-inflammatory effects by preventing degradation of regulatory components of the NF-B pathway. SLPI is also implicated in wound healing as reported by Ashcroft et al. SLPI exerts anti-HIV properties not through direct interaction with the virus, but rather through interacting with the target host cell (86). despite decreasing viral load, SLPI did not alter the infectivity of progeny virions, suggesting that SLPI inhibits HIV at the early stages of viral infection. a balance between proteases and antiproteases is established to ensure respiratory homeostasis. a shift in the balance toward increased protease expression and activity can lead to overt inflammation and the development of chronic lung disorders such as COPD and emphysema. proteases, such as SLPI, inhibit the function of serine proteases and block viral entry into the target cell. proteases are key components of respiratory host defense. proteases maintain tissue homeostasis and their activities are regulated by antiproteases. il-8, defensins, antiproteases (46, 84, 188) Epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils (41, 51, 147) Metal endopeptidases with conserved zinc binding site Neutrophil-derived proteases (NE, cathepsin G, proteinase 3) Elastin, collagen, fibronectin, laminin cathepsins have been linked to respiratory virus infection since cathepsin L cleaves and activates the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) cathepsin B is induced during IAV infection in mice (20, 27) TTSPs are a family of proteases that possess an NH2-terminal transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a COOH-terminal serine protease domain. protease activity is attained through the nucleophilic serine, which attacks the substrate's carbonyl functional group. the catalytic domains are located on the terminal extracellular region to permit direct exposure to the extracellular environment. in/transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) subfamily contains hepsin, TMPRSS2-5 and 13, mosaic serine protease large-form, and enteropeptidase; the corin protease; and the matriptase subfamily that includes matriptase 1\u20133 and polyserase-1 (5).

Nrf2 Decreases Oxidative Stress, Modifies Components of the Protease/antiprotease Balance, and protects against the development of Lung Disease and Viral Infection. antioxidants are an attractive strategy to modulate the protease/antiprotease balance and protect against chronic lung disease and viral infection. antioxidants are a broad class of molecules that can be found in a variety of foods and have been shown to exert potent host defense effects. flavan-3-ols found in green tea have been studied extensively in the context of a viral infection. EGCG binds to CD4 T cell receptors and prevents interaction with gp120, a HIV envelope protein (87). EGCG agglutinates influenza viruses and inhibits viral replication. olar macrophages from COPD patients increase clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74) SFN elevates bacterial detection and induces phagocytosis in alveolar macrophages from COPD patients, which is dependent on Nrf2 activation. sulforaphane (SFN) dampens inflammation, alleviates oxidative stress, and alters the protease/antiprotease balance. Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds antioxidant response element (ARE) regions on various cytoprotective promoters.
