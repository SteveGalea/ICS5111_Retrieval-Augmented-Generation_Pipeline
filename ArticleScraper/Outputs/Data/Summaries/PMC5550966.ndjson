{"summary": "early-warning signals (EWS) are summary statistics derived from dynamical systems theory. they are calculable directly from observed data. this phenomenon is expected to be observable in systems continually subject to shocks. pathogens with pandemic potential include influenza virus [9] and coronaviruses [10]. Similarly, pathogens which have been successfully controlled can re-emerge, for example, pertussis [11]. key epidemiological determinants, such as the infectious period, the mode of transmission, infectiousness and rate of spillover, are typically unknown or poorly quantified. the birth\u2013death\u2013immigration process can be viewed as the simplest possible model of emerging diseases with direct transmission, modelling spillover of a pathogen from an external source, together with secondary chains of transmission fed by a large susceptible pool. the second approach uses a likelihood-based method to test emergence as a hypothesis. the elimination threshold is passed when v = 1 R10 = 0.8. the elimination threshold is passed when v = 1 R10 = 0.8. the conventional theory of EWS relies on the presence of critical slowing down. the BDI process is one of the simplest models of a subcritical disease [23]. it neglects the effects of susceptible depletion, assuming that only a small fraction of the population are infected at any one time, and that the pool of susceptibles is replenished with sufficient speed. the transition rates for infection and recovery are 2.1. a particular outbreak can be considered as a superposition of the separate chains of transmission caused by each introduced case during the outbreak. the basic reproductive number is defined as the average number of secondary cases, R0 = /, found using the offspring distribution of the associated branching process [30,32]. the autocorrelation approaches one, whereas the coefficient of variation remains constant below the transition. the correlation time gives a measure of the persistence of correlations. it is the mathematical definition of critical slowing down. two simplifying assumptions are implicit in the model. first, the BDI process neglects susceptible depletion. second, the speed with which changes is ignored. the effects of relaxing the first of these assumptions will be investigated. the force of infection in the SIS and SIRS models is = (n + )/N, where n is the number of infected and N the total population size. the autocorrelation is calculated at lag one week, AC(1). for the smallest population size, N = 102, the mean number of infected individuals is less than one, irrespective of R0. below the transition, the responsiveness of the EWS decreases with immune duration, cf. the similarity in the index of dispersion and Kolmogorov complexity for N = 104 in the SIS model and N = 106 in the SIRS model. a likelihood-ratio test is proposed by Boettiger and Hastings. the test determines whether the dynamics are approaching a transition or are instead stationary. the value of Cox's provides a measure of how much disease emergence is favoured. the log-likelihood of the MLE for the null hypothesis (no emergence) is 4.2 and for the null model is 4.3. Cox's statistic is 10.78, implying that the hypothesis of disease emergence is statistically supported. simulation generated using an SIS model with R0(t) = R0(0) + R0t increasing linearly from 0 to 1.2 over 12 years. data are output weekly. probability surface is calculated using only data from the first 6 years. red lines correspond to the stationary results for the BDI model. green lines to simulated time series, data output weekly. the autocorrelation is calculated at lag one week, AC(1). time to emergence calculated using the MLE, Te = W + (1 R0(0))/R0. true value of the time to emergence shown in black. BDI process results also shown for comparison. the theoretical results for the EWS are calculated by finding the moments and autocorrelation of a stochastic process. when the disease emerges over a finite time scale, the process is non-stationary, and therefore also non-ergodic, due to changing R0(t). in practice, averages are calculated using data points which were generated at different values of R0; for example, if T = 10 years and W = 100 weeks, the difference in R0 between the start and end of the window sensitivity of P(R0 > 1 | y) to changes in y depends heavily on the EWS. large values for the mean, variance and entropy strongly indicate transmission of the pathogen is supercritical. for EWS which peak near R0 = 1, there is low indication whether the disease is supercritical or not, unless the observed value is especially large. large window sizes lead to an improved performance, as does a faster speed of emergence. for faster speeds of emergence (T 20 years) and larger windows (W 200 weeks), Cox's performs well. discussion/conclusion This work is intended to provide a theoretical base for the development of methods to anticipate disease emergence. the first approach is to extend the literature on EWS, reformulating them in a manner appropriate for emerging diseases. the second approach makes use of Cox's, a likelihood-ratio test for emergence. our results show how these demographic and immunological considerations impact on the performance of EWS. we expect our results will have applicability to a wide range of emerging infectious diseases. this generality is of particular importance for emerging infectious diseases. a universal increase in R0 is unlikely to be the driver of emergence. superspreading events have been identified for SARS and more recently for MERS [21,40] further work is ongoing studying EWS and Cox's. data accessibility All code and data are available at Dryad: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7kt3h [42]. authors agree with the conclusions of the paper.
