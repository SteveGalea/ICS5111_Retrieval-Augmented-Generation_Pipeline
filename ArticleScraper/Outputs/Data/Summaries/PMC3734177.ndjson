{"summary": "papain family cysteine proteases are critical to pathogenicity of many microorganisms. many bacteria secrete several nonspecific proteases e.g. Pseudomonas, Serratia, Clostridium, Candida, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Staphylococcus sp. cystatin superfamily of proteins comprises both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cysteine protease inhibitors [7] human cystatins C, D and S, rat cystatins A and S, chicken cystatin and oryza cystatin have been reported to inhibit the replication of certain viruses and bacteria. the key role of cysteine proteases in microbial infections coupled with the relative lack of redundancy compared to mammalian systems has made m d pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives as a potent and novel cysteine protease inhibitors which acts as antibacterial agents. papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and Bz-DL-Arg-pNA (BAPNA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. a grid box of 606060 was generated around active site of papain. the number of docking runs was set to 10. each docking was repeated five times, having in the end a total of 50 docking runs. ten derivatives of 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine were synthesized according to siddiqui et al., 2006 [22]. ten derivatives of 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine were synthesized according to the results of docking studies. the capacity of the 1-substituted Pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives to inhibit cysteine proteases was tested using papain as the model enzyme. the proteolytic activity of the reaction mixtures was determined using Bz-DL-Arg-pNA as the model enzyme. in against 1- substituted pyridylimidazo[1,5-a] pyridine derivatives (G) were determined by the equation. Temperature dependence of the inhibition constants was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters. DMSO was taken as negative control and Ceftriaxone and clotrimazole were taken as positive control. the MICs were taken as the lowest inhibitor concentration at which the bacterial growth was inhibited. the average of three values was calculated and that was the MIC for the test material and bacterial strain. microbes Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-25923; Proteus vulgaris); Bacillus spp. (ATCC-14593); Klebsiella pneumonia (ATCC-13883); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-13883); Serratia morganii (ATCC-31665) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. a grid box of 606060 was generated around active site of papain making sure those inhibitors can freely rotate inside the grid. each docking was repeated five times, having in the end a total of 50 docking runs, to check the precision of results. the docked complexes were then visualized using PyMol. 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (3a); 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl) imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (3c); 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(2-methylphenyl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (3h); 1-(2-Pyridyl)-3-(3-me 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives to inhibit cysteine proteases was tested using papain as the model enzyme. the proteolytic activity of the reaction mixtures was determined by the equation. the assay was done at different temperatures (32\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 42\u00b0C) calculating various Ki of 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives with papain as model enzyme. MIC50 of these derivatives, showing inhibition in the preliminary tests, were further determined by the microtitre plate technique. 25 L aliquots of bacteria at 1105 CFU/ml in SPB containing 0.03% LB broth were incubated with 25 L of diluted compounds for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the mixtures of bacteria and compounds were serially diluted 10-fold with SPB and plated on LB plates. bacterial pathogens have a unique papain-like hydrolytic activity to block the normal host cell cycle progression. the similarity of this AvrPphB protein with papain includes the catalytic triad of Cys-98, His-212, and Asp-227 in the AvrPphB active site. Molecular docking study provided the structural insight into the binding of these compounds (3a\u2013j) within the active site of papain which mainly consist of a catalytic triad of Cys 25, His 159 and Asp 175 [32]. role of other residues present in the active site of papain, playing important role in the accommodation of compounds have also been revealed. however, only four compounds were considered for discussion. compounds 3a\u2013d interact with papain which includes (Tyr61, Asn64, Gly65 & Tyr67) amino acids. the active site residues that were found to be key player in the interaction of compounds within the active site were Cys25, Tyr61, His159 and Trp177. idues Involved Hydrogen Bonding Hydrophobic Interaction 3a 6.12 7.32 32.48 W177, Q19 Q19, S21, C22, G23, D158, H159, W177 3b 5.76 7.04 59.89 No Hydrogen Bond C25, Y61, G66, Y67, W69, V133, H159, A160 3c 6.84 8.57 9.64 No Hydrogen Bond C25, Y61, G65, all compounds (3a\u2013d) were found to interact with papain through hydrophobic interactions at most instances during in silico studies. the same was observed by the analysis of Van\u2019t Hoff plots for all the proposed inhibitors at three different temperatures (32\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C) this proves the importance of these types of interactions in the positioning of compounds within the active site. further wet lab results proposed the non competitive interaction of compounds (3a, 3c & 3d) with papa the IC50 values were also found to be 13.40, 21.17, 94.50 and 96.50 M for compounds 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d respectively. all the compounds showed non competitive, reversible inhibitions but all showed hydrophobic and entropically driven interaction. compound 3c & 3d are having much difference in their IC50 values. they showed exact pattern for their antibacterial activity for all microbes except for E. coli at one instance each. microorganisma Compound 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 3a b MIC50 0.9(0.04) 0.8(0.04) 0.7(0.03) 0.6(0.03) 0.6(0.03) 0.8(0.04) b MIC90 1.7(0.08) 1.6(0.06) 0.99(0.04) 1.09(0.05) 1.5(0.09) b MBC50 1.8(0.09) 1.6(0.08) 1.3(0.06) 1.2(0.06) 1.3(0.06) 1.1( MIC90 2.4(0.13) 1.9(0.1) 1.7(0.07) 1.7(0.08) 1.1(0.06) 2.2(0.11) 1.9(0.09) MBC50 2.4(0.12) 2.2(0.11) 1.8(0.09) 1.9(0.09) 1.2(0.06) 2.4(0.12) 2.1(0.11) 1.1(0.09) MIC90 4.7(0.23) 4.3(0.2) 3.4(0.16) 3.8(0.19) 2.3(0.15) 4(0.2) Clotrimazole MIC50 0.0009(0.000045) 0.00084 (0.000042) NT 45(2.25) 40(2.0) NT MIC90 0.0016(0.00008) 0.00145 (0.000072) NT 85(4.25) 75(3.75) NT MBC90 0.003 (0.00015) 0.0032 (0.00016) NT 144(7.2) 134(6.7). the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of compounds (3a\u2013d) were observed to be in great agreement with their respective inhibition constant (Ki)/IC50 values against papain. the partition coefficient (logP) is a well-established measure of the compound\u2019s lipophilicity. all the compounds studied except 3d showed good agreement with the criteria laid down for the prediction of a compound to be a potential drug. 6.19 (5.23) 305 0.16 0.16 N N N 3 0 2 3d 6.88 (6.57) 7.48 (5.72) 399 16.3 0.09 N Y N Y 4 1 4 a compounds to have a reasonable propability of being well absorbt their logP value must not be greater than 5.0. b more than 80% of all traded drugs have a molecular weight below 450. d 80% of the drugs have a positive druglikeness value."}
