{"summary": "findings We have developed ANDES, a software library and a suite of applications for the statistical ANalyses of DEep Sequencing. the fundamental data structure underlying ANDES is the position profile, which contains the nucleotide distributions for each genomic position resultant from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) the MSA is a useful visual aid when analyzing a small set of sequences within a sample. existing tools, such as BioPerl [3], BioPython [4], and SAMtools [5] are useful for efficiently generating, manipulating and storing MSAs. the ANDES toolset was developed to identify loci-specific sequencing errors for a 454 Titanium sequencing run performed on a subregion of the 16S rRNA gene. the deep sequencing of clonal copies of a 16S sequence provided the data to empirically determine actual PCR and sequencing errors. column 1 contains the most common allele. columns 2-5 represent the frequency of each nucleotide at each position. the most common allele at a position is a gap. ANDES allows for the integration of alternative MSA tools such as MUSCLE. to complete the profile merge, the new position frequencies are then summed for each column. the corresponding positional frequencies between the two aligned profiles are then compared. the nucleotide, p, is an element of the nucleotide set A, T, G, C, - where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align the two profiles. the position, i, ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment, L. the number of insertions and deletions (indels) that were necessary to align the sequences in the MSA, are also included for each position. RMSD values can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the RMSD value for every position along the length of the alignment, L. each value is the average positional RMSD along the lengths of the 2 compared HA segments. each value is the average positional RMSD along the lengths of the 2 compared HA segments. the nucleotide, p, is an element of A, T, G, C, where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align all the sequences within the sample. the position, i, ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment, L. formula computes probability of base q in aligned position i in Sample X. p and q are from the nucleotide set A, T, G, C, -. one will typically see a significantly higher base conversion rate between transitions (AG or CT) than transversions (other remaining combinations) profiles to consensus generation automatically converts a position profile into a consensus sequence using the standard IUPAC ambiguity codes. it is preferable to use the largest sample possible, since this will represent the population of interest most accurately. an application of threshold-based filtering can be to remove low levels of nucleotide representations as a result of sequencing errors. in this example, the ambiguity code assigned to the position was D, because the position required representation for the existence of A, T, and C in the sample. a sequencing error upper bound rate of 5% was determined and used as a threshold for filtering low prevalence nucleotide representations. the probability of an error is defined as the probability of not attaining the most common allele. if the empirically determined error rate is 0, then the QV is set to 40 (i.e., 0.0001 errors per base) most base callers limit their maximum QV to 40, although there is no theoretical limit. IUPAC ambiguity codes [10] in the alignment are given equal weight for each nucleotide they represent. for example, the IUPAC code, M, represents A or C. the major allele is also stored in the profile for visual convenience. the results from the clustalw alignment are then used as a proxy to the underlying nucleotide distributions. ANDES also allows for the integration of alternative MSA tools, such as MUSCLE, which can also produce clustalw-like output. the nucleotide, p, is an element of the nucleotide set A, T, G, C, where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align the two profiles. the position, i, ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment, L. the number of insertions and deletions (indels) that were necessary to align the sequences in the MSA, are also included for each position. RMSD values between a biallelic sample, X, and a monoallelic sample, Y can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the RMSD value for every position along the length of the alignment, L. each value is the average positional RMSD along the lengths of the 2 compared HA segments. this NSE has a range between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no variation. 1 represents maximum variation (the uniform existence of A, T, G, C and gaps) the position, i, ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment, L. nucleotide conversion analyses The base conversion probabilities between two samples can be computed between aligned profiles. p and q are from the nucleotide set A, T, G, C, -. i is the nucleotide position range between 1 to the length of the gapped alignment, L. profile to consensus generation automatically converts a position profile into a consensus sequence using the standard IUPAC ambiguity codes. it is preferable to use the largest sample possible, since this will represent the population of interest most accurately and minimize the effects of random errors. an application of threshold-based filtering can be to remove low levels of nucleotide representations as a result of sequencing errors. a sequencing error upper bound rate of 5% was determined and used as a threshold for filtering low prevalence nucleotide representations. the necessity for a C representation was removed, allowing the new ambiguity code to become a W, representing A or T. probability of an error is defined as the probability of not attaining the most common allele. a QV of greater than 40 is optionally permitted. most base callers limit their maximum QV to 40. Exceptions occurred around 450 bp (a dinucleotide repeat) and at the 5' and 3' ends, where even the reference MSA was questionable due to improper gapping. the combination of lower sequencing quality towards the 3' end of sequences, mismatching sequence lengths, and short tandem repeats typically contribute to poor end MSAs.

Exceptions occur around 450 bp, where a tandem repeat causes a MSA error, and at the 3' end of the profile. parallel compute times were estimated as the sum of the serial times for the same 3 steps. parallel and serial compute times for sequence alignment and profile generation were computed by finding the maximum and sum, respectively, across individual job times. parallel and serial compute times for each partition were calculated by summing up the parallel and serial compute times, respectively, across sequence alignment, profile generation, and profile merge. a position profile was generated for each of the sequenced passages. the approximate coverage depth for base positions ranged from 500x to 1000x. the RMSD plot was then generated based on the positional RMSD values computed between the position profiles and the reference. 1st passage nucleotides have been labeled for each row on the left. 10th passage nucleotides have been labeled for each column at the top of the table. transition probabilities (AG or CT) tend to be greater than transversion probabilities. to interpret measure at 1st passage G/10th passage A, one could say there is a 0.47% probability that a G in the first passage will become an A at the 10th passage, P(A in 10th passage G in 1st passage) = 0.47%. transition frequencies have been highlighted in bold. hemagglutinin (HA) coding segments of human influenza A H1N1 sequences were downloaded from NCBI and were grouped according to the collection date that was annotated in their respective GenBank records. if the collection date was not available, then the sequence would be assigned to the partition with the same month with a null day. sequences collected on the left-hand side are likely attributed to the circulating seasonal H1N1 virus. the sequences collected on the right-hand side were based on the circulating seasonal H1N1 virus. a consensus sequence can be generated for downstream applications, such as degenerate primer design. a mock community consisted of 22 known microbial organisms from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria was established. PCR amplification targeted 3 variable regions of the ribosomal 16S gene, each approximately 500 bp in length. PCR products were then sequenced using 454 Titanium. the resultant sequences were then analyzed using results from the studies indicate that there was little correlation between quality values and 454 assigned quality values. the consensus sequences from 454 assemblies are generally of high quality because the availability of coverage depth ameliorates the impact of random errors. the level of individual error rates cannot be dismissed if they are intended for downstream cluster analyses. ANDES provides a useful tool set and a basis for the comparison of complex samples at the level of positional nucleotide distributions. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
