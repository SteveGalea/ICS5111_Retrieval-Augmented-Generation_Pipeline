{"summary": "a cohort of 13 long-term non-progressors (LTNP) identified from 135 individuals with transfusion-acquired HIV infection, 5 remained LTNP after 23 to 26 years infection, but only 3 retained elite LTNP status. p24-specific proliferative response was associated with control of viraemia when combined with p24 proliferative responses. viraemia at study entry was predictive of loss of LTNP status and/or disease progression in 6 of 8. a decline in this protective p24 response preceded or correlated with loss of non-progressor status and/or signs of disease progression. early studies on this cohort of TAHIV patients led to the identification of the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort (SBBC) of long-term survivors. an attenuated nef-deleted strain of HIV-1, transmitted from a single donor resulted in slow to non-progression in these individuals. however, after prolonged infection, not all SBBC members maintained non-progressive disease [10-13] 13 LTNP were identified in the NSW TAHIV cohort. a consistent decline in CD4 T cell counts below 500/l, and plasma viraemia >5000 copies/ml. disease progression was defined by a CD4 T cell count of 200. the proliferative response to HIV-1 p24 was determined by 6 day culture of PBMC (1 105 cells/well) after 6 days, proliferative responses were determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation during a further 6 hours culture. results were expressed as stimulation index (SI; mean counts antigen wells/mean counts control wells), and a SI >3 was considered a positive response. nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 1.5 kb of the HIV gag gene. RNA was amplified using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit. PCR reactions were performed using the outer primer pair. multiple sequences derived from each patient were analysed using Sequencher 3.11 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) chroomatograms derived from both forward and reverse primers were aligned with the reference strain HIV-1 HXB2. anti-HIV T cell function assays were performed as previously described. the proliferative response to HIV-1 p24 was determined by 6 day culture of PBMC (1 105 cells/well) in RPMI medium with 15% pooled human serum in round bottom microtitre plates. RNA was amplified using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) PCR reactions contained 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega: 1 mM Tris- HCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 nM of each dNTP. chroomatograms derived from both forward and reverse primers were aligned with the reference strain HIV-1 HXB2. a cohort of 13 (10%) remained asymptomatic after 10 years of infection. most of these individuals had a survival advantage. the loss of non-progressor status was based on increasing viraemia and/or decreasing CD4 counts in 5 of 8, and initiation of ART in these individuals. another two elderly individuals (C18 and C54; both SBBC members) died before losing their non-progressor status. antiviral CTL responses were variable during the second decade of HIV infection. strong Gag-specific CTL were detected in the cohort 2 non-progressors (C13, C53, C122, and C105 before ART) but the predominant CTL response in the SBBC members was against Pol antigens. a decline in Gag-specific T cell responses preceding detectable viraemia was demonstrated in C13. this decline up to year 16 was followed by a period of low detectable viraemia between years 19 \u2013 22. a rebound in these Gag-specific T cell responses coincided with the first detectable viraemia at 19 years. g peptides were used to test sequential PBMC spanning the study period by ELISPOT. a broad strong response by C53's PBMC to multiple immunodominant epitopes. the sequential analysis revealed relatively high stability in the repertoire of Gag responses over the past 10 years. individual peptides intersecting positive peptide pools containing HLA-relevant epitopes were then tested individually. Mean INF- spots/106 PBMC (SFC) and representative ELISPOT images are shown. limited immune escape from HLA B27-restricted CTL failed to contain increasing viral replication in later years. a well characterised escape mutant [34] was detected from the earliest time point in C117. this escape mutant was not the cause for the loss of control of viraemia in C122. 5 of 8 former non-progressors had the FcRIIA polymorphism (R/R) the effect of the R/R genotype in promoting disease progression was not significant in this small study of 13 individuals. the loss of non-progressor status was based on increasing viraemia. inant p24 (stimulation index; significant responses >3, defined by the broken line); and IFN responses (ELISPOT) by CTL against autologous BCL expressing HIV-1 antigens after infection with recombinant vaccinia. low viraemia was detected at earlier time points in C122. however, Gag CTL failed to contain viraemia in C122 beyond approximately 20 years. similar correlation between anti viral immune responses and a spike in viral replication was demonstrated in SBBC member C18. we mapped the breadth of the anti-Gag CTL response in non-progressors. we mapped the breadth of the response over time in patients with at least moderate CLT responses to whole Gag antigens. a strong but restricted Gag response was also seen in C18. pol CTL recognition was confirmed by subsequent analysis of responses to peptide pools derived from the full set of overlapping 15-mer peptides. moderate to strong responses to multiple pools containing epitopes in the reverse transcriptase protein were detected in SBBC members C49, C64, C18, C54, but weakly in C98. C18 also responded strongly to integrase peptides. restricted recognition of only one A3 and two B27 Gag epitopes in C13 appeared sufficient to have contained viraemia for many years. however, the most recent viral load result suggested that immune escape from these B27-restricted CTL may have occurred recently. the predominant response by C122 against an immunodominant B27 epitope may have contained earlier spikes of increased viraemia. two SBBC subjects that did not consent to prospective analysis died from unrelated causes in 1987 and 1994. the sole SBBC recipient on therapy (C98) has since died from non-HIV causes. control of viraemia at low levels along with normal CD4 T cell counts suggested there was no evidence for loss LTNP status before death. specific CD4 and CD8 memory T cell pool increased and were maintained throughout this period. effector CTL peaked then declined as viraemia declined. the strongest CTL responses were detected in those with detectable viraemia. the p24-specific proliferative response was the key event that contributed to the failure of CTL to control viraemia. the neutralising antibody (NAb) response is another immune mechanism that may contribute to long term control of viraemia. disease progression in one SBBC member (C98) and the SBBC infecting donor was associated with the emergence of divergent strains. these individuals lacked protective p24 proliferative responses and had detectable viraemia before viral divergence occurred. a lack of helper T cell responses may result in a reduced capacity to contain viral replication by other immune effector responses including CTL.
