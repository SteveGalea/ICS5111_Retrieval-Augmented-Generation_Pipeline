{"summary": "viral genomes are composed of DNA or RNA, either of which may be single- or double-stranded; replication may take place in the nucleus or cytoplasm of the cell; infection may give rise to acute or persistent infection; viruses may be agents of disease or innocuous; and the consequences of infection may vary in different organisms or cell types. ends (capped, not capped, cap-substituted) and 3\u2032 ends (polyadenylated or not) carry various cis-acting sequences and elements (internal ribosome entry sites [IRES], protein binding sites, etc.) the primary eukaryotic translation initiation factor targets involved in recognizing each structural element. enterovirus (an enterovirus), feline calicivirus, and retroviruses encode proteases that cleave eIF4G. both eIF4GI and eIF4GII are cleaved, and host shut-off correlates more closely with the protracted cleavage of eIF4GII. eIF4E is able to interact with eIF4G and assemble the multi-subunit eIF4F complex (4E, 4A, 4G) on the m7GTP-capped (orange ball) mRNA 5\u2032 end. eIF4F assembly typically results in eIF4E phosphorylation by the eIF4G-associated kinase Mnk and recruits eIF3 bound to the 40S ribosome sub p70 S6K activation by mTORC1 stimulates eIF4A-accessory factor eIF4B. 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation relieves translational repression. enteroviral, apthoviral, caliciviral, and retroviral proteases also cleave the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) the large DNA-containing poxviruses produce small non-coding polyadenylated RNAs (POLADs) that have been reported to impair host PABP-dependent translation. some RNA viruses also induce eIF2 phosphorylation to impair host responses. how viral mRNAs are translated under the latter conditions remains unknown. eIF4E is redistributed to the nucleus by poliovirus. eIF4E is redistributed to the nucleus by poliovirus. eIF4E is redistributed to the nucleus by poliovirus. eIF4E accumulates within the nuclei of infected cells. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) do not stimulate PABP recruitment into eIF4F complexes. but redistribute it to the nucleus, which may contribute to host shut-off by some herpesviruses. both of these large DNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm within viral factories. redistribution of a number of eIFs to these sites may contribute to the suppression of host protein synthesis while at the same time favoring viral mRNA translation. cellular mRNA nuclear export is inhibited in Ad-infected cells. the endoribonuclease encoded by the HSV-1 virion host shut-off gene associates with eIF4F by interacting with eIF4A and eIF4B/eIF4H to increase mRNA turnover of host and viral mRNAs. a related protein encoded by KSHV ORF57 binds a host factor, PYM, onto viral mRNAs, potentially coupling viral mRNA export and translation. a key component of the cellular antiviral response relies on RNase L, which inactivates both rRNA and mRNA. Poliovirus and CrPV suppress processing (P)\u2013body formation. it could represent another strategy to antagonize host responses. P-bodies restrict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. influenza virus, and adenovirus decrease eIF4E phosphorylation. by binding to eIF4G, the Ad 100K protein displaces the kinase Mnk1. this stimulates selective late viral mRNA translation. this may contribute to host shut-off. p70 S6K activation by mTORC1 stimulates the eIF4A-accessory factor eIF4B and inhibits eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase. 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation relieves translational repression and releases eIF4E. retroviral proteases also cleave the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) the rotavirus NSP3 protein disrupts the PABP\u2013eIF4G association. the large DNA-containing poxviruses produce small non-coding polyadenylated RNAs (POLADs) that have been reported to impair host PABP-dependent translation. encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), poliovirus, cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), VSV, Sindbis virus (SINV), Dengue virus (DENV), and reovirus (Gingras et al. 1996; Connor and Lyles 2002; Villas-Boas et al. 2009; Garrey et al. 2010; Mohankumar et al. 2011); small DNA viruses such as eIF4E is redistributed to the nucleus by poliovirus. the 2A protein encoded by EMCV, another picornavirus, has a nuclear localization signal and binds to eIF4E. if eIF4E accumulates within the nuclei of infected cells remains unknown. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) does not redistribute PABP to the nucleus. redistribution of host factors also occurs in cells infected with vaccinia virus (VacV), a poxvirus, or african swine fever virus (ASFV), an asfarvirus. both of these large DNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm within specialized compartments termed viral factories. capped oligonucleotides prime viral RNA synthesis (Plotch et al. 1981; Garcin et al. 1995; Reguera et al. 2010). capped oligonucleotides prime viral RNA synthesis. this process destabilizes host mRNAs and inhibits host mRNA translation. accelerating viral mRNA turnover helps demarcate different kinetic populations of virus-encoded mRNAs expressed at immediate-early, early, or late times post-infection. the KSHV SOX protein also cleaves mRNA but recruits XRN1 to mediate target mRNA degradation. a molecular signature associated with virus infection, oligoadenylate (OA) polynucleotide chains with a unique 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 linkage, are generated by the IFN-inducible OA synthetase (OAS) to preserve the integrity of viral mRNAs and cellular rRNAs, viruses have evolved an array of countermeasures. distinct plant virus-encoded VPg proteins selectively associate with different translation factors. tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) VPg binds eEF1A and concentrates it in membrane-associated viral replication sites. potyvirus potato virus A VPg promotes both viral protein synthesis and/or impair host translation. class II IRES recruits the 40S pre-initiation complex through its binding to eIF3. the viral 2A protease cleaves eIF4G, inhibiting host cap-dependent translation. the eIF4E cap-binding slot must be unoccupied, rendering HAV IRES initiation cap-independent. the class III IRES in HCV and pestivirus RNAs uses a prokaryote-like mode of translation initiation by positioning ribosomes on the mRNA through interactions with both eIF3 and the ribosome itself. the simian picornavirus (SPV9) IRES binds eIF3 and the 40S ribosome, yet its activity is enhanced by eIF4F. the CrPV IRES is able to initiate protein synthesis from an alanine codon. the small ribosomal subunit protein RPS25 is essential for initiation from the CrPV and HCV IRES. deficiencies in rRNA pseudouridylation reduce CrPV IRES binding to 40S ribosome subunits and inhibit IRES-dependent translation. the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) CITE contains a 102-bp tRNA-like structural element that recruits ribosomes. a related strategy for recruiting factors to the 3\u2032 UTR is used by DENV. some RNA viruses that produce mRNAs with m7GTP-capped 5\u2032 ends can still use cap-independent modes of translation initiation. icivirus VPg interacts with eIF4E or eIF3 to mediate ribosome recruitment to viral mRNAs. distinct plant virus-encoded VPg proteins selectively associate with different translation factors. potyvirus potato virus A VPg promotes both viral mRNA stability and translation, effectively functioning as a proteinaceous cap. class I and class II IRESs recruit the 40S pre-initiation complex through its binding to eIF3. the viral 2A protease cleaves eIF4G, inhibiting host cap-dependent translation. the viral 2A protease cleaves eIF4G, inhibiting host cap-dependent translation. the class III IRES in HCV and pestivirus RNAs uses a prokaryote-like mode of translation initiation by positioning ribosomes on the mRNA through interactions with both eIF3 and the 40S ribosome itself. the simian picornavirus (SPV9) IRES binds eIF3 and the 40S ribosome, yet its activity is enhanced by eIF4F. CrPV IRES is able to initiate protein synthesis from an alanine codon. the small ribosomal subunit protein RPS25 is essential for initiation from the CrPV and HCV IRES. deficiencies in rRNA pseudouridylation reduce CrPV IRES binding to 40S ribosome subunits and inhibit IRES-dependent translation. the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) CITE contains a 102-bp tRNA-like structural element that recruits ribosomes. a related strategy for recruiting factors to the 3\u2032 UTR is used by DENV. some RNA viruses that produce mRNAs with m7GTP-capped 5\u2032 ends can still use cap-independent modes of translation initiation. human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 inhibits the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) papilloma virus (HPV) E6 activates mTORC1 and stimulates 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation. shunting is stimulated by the Ad 100 K protein, which binds TPL sequences and eIF4G. a shunting mechanism also controls production of the HPV E1 replication protein from a polycistronic mRNA. two -herpesvirus proteins, KSHV vGPCR and EBV LMP2A, also activate signaling pathways upstream of mTORC1. mTOR active-site inhibitors PP242 and Torin1 target both mTORC1 and 2. kinase conserved among different herpesviruses stimulates eEF1B phosphorylation. 4E-BP1 is degraded by proteasome in cells infected with HSV-1 or VacV. inactivation of 4E-BP1 is not sufficient to promote eIF4F assembly in HSV-1-infected cells. HCMV uses different strategies to control eIF4F activity. translation initiation factor abundance is selectively reduced by virus-encoded functions. an HCMV RNA-binding protein (UL69) important for viral mRNA export from the nucleus reportedly interacts with eIF4A and PABP and stimulates eIF4E release from 4E-BP1. both viruses encode their own mRNA capping enzymes. VacV and ASFV infection also promotes 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation by mTORC1. the rabbit poxvirus myxoma M-T5 protein directly activates Akt signaling. eIF4E Phosphorylation promotes DNA Virus Replication. eIF4E phosphorylation is dependent on ERK and/or p38 MAPK signaling. the small molecule Mnk1 inhibitor impairs HSV1 (Walsh and Mohr 2004), HCMV (Walsh et al. 2005), ASFV (Castell\u00f3 et al. 2009), and VacV replication is reduced in Mnk1-deficient MEFs. coronavirus mRNAs rely on eIF4F because chemical inhibitors impair coronavirus replication in cultured cells. viral cap-binding polymerase subunit proteins PB2 and NS1 reportedly interact with eIF4G and PABP. papilloma virus inhibits the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) papilloma virus (HPV) E6 activates mTORC1 and stimulates 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation. herpesviruses Among the largest of the DNA viruses, herpesviruses replicate in the nucleus and exist in two discrete developmental states. infection results in lifelong latency characterized by a restricted gene expression program, punctuated by episodic reactivation events. different herpesvirus subfamily members colonize specialized differentiated cell types. two -herpesvirus proteins, KSHV vGPCR (Sodhi et al. 2006; Nichols et al. 2011) also activate signaling pathways upstream of mTORC1. mTOR active-site inhibitors PP242 and Torin1 target both mTORC1 and 2. their effect requires the translation repressor 4E-BP1. inactivation of 4E-BP1 is not sufficient to promote eIF4F assembly in uninfected cells. binding of eIF4E to eIF4G requires the virus-encoded ICP6 protein (Walsh and Mohr 2006), which shares a small domain with homology to hsp27. HCMV uses different strategies to control eIF4F activity. poxviruses and asfarviruses (ASFV) cause acute infections and replicate in the cytoplasm. VacV and ASFV redistribute eIF4E and eIF4G to cytoplasmic viral factories. VacV and ASFV infection also promotes 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation by mTORC1 (Walsh et al. 2008; Castell\u00f3 et al. 2009). rabbit poxvirus myxoma M-T5 protein directly activates Akt signaling. HSV1 and VacV replication is also reduced in MEFs containing an eIF4E-substituted allele in which eIF4E cannot be phosphorylated. eIF4E phosphorylation regulates virus replication. coronavirus infection stimulates eIF4E phosphorylation. eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation have been reported in avian reovirus-infected cells or in cells expressing the viral p17 protein. eIF2GTP forms a ternary complex (TC) composed of eIF2, GTP, and an initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) eIF2 kinase PKR acts as a pattern recognition sentinel that detects dsRNA or viral replication intermediates. once activated, phosphorylated eIF2 accumulates and binds with high affinity to the eIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange factor inactive eIF2 (,, subunits depicted in center) bound to GDP (eIF2GDP) is recycled to the active GTP-bound form (eIF2GTP) by the five-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. eIF2 phosphorylation on its -subunit (S51) prevents eIF2 recycling. eIF2 kinases have also been implicated in autophagy induction. this powerful host response has forced viruses to evolve countermeasures. eIF2 kinases have also been implicated in autophagy induction. VacV encodes a pseudosubstrate, K3L, that effectively deflects PKR and PERK away from its substrate, eIF2. eIF2 itself can be targeted for dephosphorylation by viral functions. PERK and PKR pseudosubstrate K3L (Chang et al. 1992; Davies et al. 1992; Davies et al. 1992; Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al. 1997; Sood et al. 2000; Ramelot et al. 2002; Pavio et al. 2003; Rothenburg et al. 2011); Genomic elements can also play a role in inhibiting PKR. classical swine fever virus (CSFV) uses both eIF2-dependent and -independent modes of translation initiation. phosphorylation of eIF2 facilitates host antiviral response by globally inhibiting protein synthesis in infected cells. eIF2 phosphorylation can effectively cause host shut-off and prevent IFN synthesis. eIF2 is also phosphorylated as poliovirus infection progresses. mRNA translation late in infection is partially resistant to stress-induced eIF2 phosphorylation. eIF2 phosphorylation is also involved in the formation of stress granules. mammalian orthoreovirus escapes translational suppression by disrupting SGs, but does so independently of the status of eIF2 phosphorylation or PKR. eIF2 itself can be targeted for dephosphorylation by viral functions. DP17L-, HPV E6-, and HSV1 34.5-encoded phosphatase regulatory subunits target cellular catalytic PP1 subunits to phosphorylated eIF2. VacV, for example, combines the dsRNA-binding protein/PKR inhibitor E3L with the PERK and PKR pseudosubstrate K3L. both the HCV NS5A protein and the HCV IRES itself (Vyas et al. 2003) directly inhibit PKR. HIV-1 Tat and the cellular TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) bind the viral TAR element, and TRBP inhibits PKR. the HCV IRES has been suggested to compete efficiently for eIF2 and Met-tRNAi under limiting conditions. eIF2 phosphorylation is induced during infection. eIF2 is also phosphorylated as poliovirus infection progresses. host factors can recruit Met-tRNAi to ribosomes and function when the AUG start codon is directly positioned in the P-site. eIF2 phosphorylation is also implicated in the formation of stress granules (SGs), stress-induced cytoplasmic sites of translationally inactive mRNA accumulation. many viruses disrupt SG formation to evade translational inhibition. Influenza and feline calicivirus (FCV) use 45- to 87-nucleotide stretches termed TURBS (termination upstream ribosome binding site) that base-pair with terminating ribosomes to promote reinitiation at nearby downstream ORFs encoding viral BM2 and VP2 proteins. cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) polycistronic mRNA involves viral and host factors that manipulate eIF3. the viral transactivator viroplasmin (TAV) associates with eIF3a, eIF3c, and ribosomal protein L24. RISP also recruits the plant cell TOR, which phosphorylates RISP. (+)-strand RNA virus genomes serve immediately as mRNAs to produce proteins required for viral replication. production of ()-strand RNA replication intermediates from (+)-strand templates is incompatible with ongoing (+)-strand translation. many of the key integrators controlling translation in response to nutrient availability, growth factors, and energy supplies are hijacked in infected cells. many of the key integrators controlling translation in response to nutrient availability, growth factors, and energy supplies are hijacked in infected cells to ensure high-level synthesis of viral proteins. pokeweed antiviral protein associates with eIF4G to access and depurinate viral RNA. cellular molecules such as ITAFs and signaling pathways are also susceptible. translational control is being exploited in the development of viral oncolytic therapies."}
