{"summary": "3D4/31 macrophages and dudleya brittonii were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. the cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system. rapid climate changes (heat wave, fine dust, etc.) have negatively affected livestock immunity. this trend has been exacerbated by the prohibition of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in livestock breeding. the FAO pathway functions by converting fatty-acyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA) and the production of palmitic acid (most basic fatty acids found in mammals) from malonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase (FASN) dudleya brittonii (D. brittonii) is a succulent plant mainly found in California and Mexico. it is used for treating asthma, an inflammatory airway obstruction disease closely associated with macrophages. a small number of succulent plants have been successfully used for commercial purposes. 3103 3D4/31 macrophages were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. after 24 h, cells were treated with DB (9 ng/mL) and/or 2 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. each absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. cell numbers were assessed every 24 h using a hemocytometer and 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue. images were processed with the Axio vision Rel. 4.7 (Carl Zeiss) and Photoshop CC 2018 program (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) cells were washed with DB (9 ng/mL) and/or 2 nM PMA for 12 h. cells were then fixed and permeabilized using ice-cold ethanol at 20\u00b0C. after 30 min incubation room temperature, cells were stained with PI solution. cDNA synthesis of 3D4/31 macrophages was performed using the 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. the qPCR was performed by using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. mRNA fold change was analyzed using the 2Ct method [24].

RESULTS Dudleya brittonii extract protect 3D4/31 macrophages against phorbol phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced cell death. the assay showed a dose-dependent decrease in viability after exposure to DB. co-treatment with DB and PMA for 24 h significantly increased the cell viability by up to 11.87%4.62% as compared to PMA treated cells. cell number (B) and phenotype (C) of 3D4/31 macrophages replaced every 24 h. survival rate of 3D4/31 macrophages dramatically decreased when activated by PMA. DB effectively prevents the PMA-induced inhibition of survival rate. exposure to DB reduces cell death in activated macrophages. results demonstrate that DB reduces cell death in activated macrophages.

DB extract promotes the M2-like metabolic reprogramming, decreases glycolysis, and increases FAO and TCA cycle. DB upregulates the cell survival rate of 3D4/31 macrophages by antioxidant and fatty acid oxidation. DB reduces macrophage activation (PMA induced) induced ROS generation and cell death. AMs function even under normal conditions, even if there is no infection. survival rate-enhancing effect of DB on activated AMs may help to prevent respiratory infectious diseases by improving the respiratory immunity of livestock. steroid treatment prevents livestock diseases, and lung infections are improved by steroid sensor stimulation such as SRC3 of AMs. DB upregulates the FAS, FAO, and TCA cycle genes, as well as SRC3 mRNA expression. study confirms a new mechanism for the association of lipid metabolism and survival enhancement in the porcine AMs. it suggests administering DB could potentially improve the survival rate of AMs."}
