{"summary": "method begins with calculating the hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence for children 5 years old and persons 5 years old from population-based surveillance in one province. this base rate of SARI is then adjusted for each province based on the prevalence of risk factors and healthcare-seeking behavior. disease burden data are sparse in low and lower-middle income countries. local data on influenza disease incidence and case counts are useful for decision makers in these countries to assess public health importance of influenza. determining the amount of influenza-associated severe disease will likely have greater public health significance in low and lower-middle income countries. 5 years defined as a modification of the WHO definition of pneumonia as any child, residing in a defined catchment area, hospitalized with cough or difficulty breathing. the denominator used to calculate rates was from Karemo Division, the division located closest to SDH. data input steps are in white boxes and data output is in shaded boxes. we calculated the rate of hospitalized SARI from base province. the number of SARI patients admitted to the surveillance hospital for each year was divided by the age-specific hospital catchment populations. we added an adjustment for HIV prevalence using the same equation [21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26]. we did not have data on HIV prevalence in children in Kenya. we calculated this prevalence using an algorithm which took into account the prevalence of HIV-infected mothers from antenatal clinics and the expected vertical transmission rate. the prevalence of household air pollution was calculated by applying the proportion of persons cooking with solid fuels to the proportion of persons living in rural and urban areas for each province. the rate of hospitalized SARI by province was calculated by applying the risk-factor adjustment described in Step 2a. percentage of hospitalized SARI associated with influenza A and B viruses was obtained from established sentinel influenza surveillance sites. in Kenya, each province had one sentinel surveillance site and in Guatemala only the two provinces with population-based SARI surveillance had influenza-specific data available for this analysis. data was only available in one province in Kenya and two departments in Guatemala. we adjusted the healthcare utilization survey-derived percentage of those who sought care at a hospital for pneumonia to each province by applying the same ratio of healthcare-seeking for ARI from the DHS that we used in Step 2b. a case of pneumonia was defined as a hospitalized patient residing in the hospital's pre-defined catchment area with at least one sign of an acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count, hypothermia) at least one sign or symptom of a respiratory tract illness (e.g. cough, rapid breathing, production of phlegm, chest pain, difficulty breathing) HIV prevalence in Nyanza Province was 13.9% among adults in 2009. a case of SARI in children 5 years was defined as a modification of the WHO definition of pneumonia as any child, residing in a defined catchment area, hospitalized with cough or difficulty breathing and any one of the following. influenza-associated Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) is rarely used in the public or private sector in Kenya, as in other sub-Saharan africa countries. data input steps are in white boxes and data output is in shaded boxes. we calculated incidence rate of hospitalized SARI from base province. our adjustments were made based on the prevalence of these risk factors in each province and their relative risk for childhood pneumonia as defined by Rudan et al. we added an adjustment for HIV prevalence using the same equation [21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26]. we did not have data on HIV prevalence in children in Kenya. the prevalence of household air pollution was calculated by applying the proportion of persons cooking with solid fuels in rural and urban areas to the proportion of persons living in rural and urban areas for each province. since 2007, national Demographic and Health Surveys have included a standardized question that asks about healthcare-seeking practices for acute respiratory illness. the percentage of hospitalized SARI associated with influenza was obtained from established sentinel influenza surveillance sites. the percentage of hospitalized SARI associated with influenza A and B viruses was obtained from established sentinel influenza surveillance sites. in Guatemala only the two provinces with population-based SARI surveillance had influenza-specific data available for this analysis. in both countries the healthcare utilization survey defined pneumonia as, \u2018cough or difficulty breathing that lasted more than 2 days or a diagnosis of pneumonia given by a doctor or professional healthcare provider in the last year\u2019. the percentage of patients who sought care at a hospital as indicative of the percentage of persons who would have access to a hospital if they were to have an episode of influenza-associated SARI. a case of pneumonia was defined as a hospitalized patient residing in the hospital's pre-defined catchment area with at least one sign of an acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count, hypothermia) all patients meeting the case definition were tested for influenza virus using real-time PCR [34]. we calculated the rate of hospitalized SARI from base province. we used a catchment area of 5 kilometers from the district hospital as our denominator. the number of SARI patients admitted to the surveillance hospital for each year of surveillance was divided by the age-specific hospital catchment populations. for persons 5 years old, the risk factors used for adjustment were household air pollution, crowding, and HIV prevalence. the prevalence of household air pollution was calculated by applying the proportion of persons cooking with solid fuel in rural and urban areas to the proportion of persons living in rural and urban areas. national Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have included a standardized question that asks about healthcare-seeking practices for acute respiratory illness. the question currently asks caretakers 'if their children under age five had been ill in the two weeks preceding the survey with a cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing' we used a weighted average of the percentage of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from provinces with 25 cases, weighted by the number of samples taken. we calculated the rate of non-hospitalized SARI [27],[28],[29]. the ratio was for each province divided by the province in which the healthcare utilization survey was done. the populations of the provinces were multiplied by the rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI. the numbers of cases in each province were summed to calculate the national number of cases for each province. a case of pneumonia was defined as a hospitalized patient, residing in the hospital's pre-defined catchment area with at least one sign of an acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count, hypothermia) all patients meeting the case definition were tested for influenza virus using real-time PCR [34] besides Quetzaltenango and Santa Rosa, no other sites had complete influenza sentinel surveillance data available. point estimates of hospitalized SARI rates by province ranged from 16.6\u201355.6 per 1,000 persons for children and 1.4\u20133.1 per 1,000 for persons 5 years old. the point estimates of hospitalized SARI rates by province ranged from 16.6\u201355.6 per 1,000 persons for children and 1.4\u20133.1 per 1,000 for persons 5 years old. the base province (Nyanza) where Karemo division is located is bolded. this adjustment factor is based on 6 risk factors for SARI and healthcare-seeking behaviors. base rate for Karemo division surveillance (Nyanza province) among children 5 in August 2009 to July 2010 is 55.55 per 1,000 persons per year. the base province (Nyanza), where Karemo division is located, is bolded. this adjustment factor is based on 3 risk factors for SARI and healthcare-seeking behaviors. the percentage of SARI with influenza virus detected varied by year and province. the rates of influenza-associated hospitalized SARI were higher among children 5 years old than among persons 5 years old in both sites. forty-eight percent of children and 34% of older persons who reported pneumonia sought care at any hospital [27] after adjustment, the rate of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI was higher than hospitalized influenza-associated SARI for persons 5 years old in Kenya. all persons Base Province Hospitalized Non-hospitalized Hospitalized Non-hospitalized August 2009\u2013July 2010 Rate per 1,000 (95% confidence limit) Siaya 3.0

the base rates of hospitalized pneumonia for children 5 years old were 9.7 and 8.7 per 1,000 persons. in the second year, rates were slightly higher for children and similar for older persons. the point estimates for the annual number of non-hospitalized cases of influenza-associated pneumonia ranged from 2,033\u20134,312 (0.9\u20132.0 per 1,000 persons) among children 5 years old and

higher among children 5 years old than among persons 5 years old in both sites. the rate of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI was higher than hospitalized influenza-associated SARI for persons 5 years old in Kenya in all provinces. point estimates for the annual number of non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI cases ranged from 19,798\u201330,275 (3.3\u20135.1 per 1,000 persons) for children 5 years old and 13,592\u201315,270 for persons 5 years old (0.42\u20130.47 per 1,000 persons) the uncertainty ranges around the annual burden estimates are shown in Table 4. in the first year, hospitalized pneumonia rates ranged from 8.8\u201315.7 per 1,000 persons for children 5 years old and 0.7\u20131.5 per 1,000 for persons 5 years old. in the second year, rates were slightly higher for children. in children 5 years, this percentage ranged from 5.5% to 8.6%. in persons 5 years, this percentage ranged from 6.6% to 19.9%. in the Santa Rosa area, 28% of children and 11% of older persons who reported pneumonia sought care at any hospital [28] the full burden of severe influenza disease in low and lower-middle income countries requires quantification of non-hospitalized cases. for persons 5 years old, the rates we found for influenza-associated SARI are similar to those presented for low and lower-middle income countries from the same region. reliable longitudinal administrative data is not available in most low and lower-middle income countries. a second methodology is to perform healthcare utilization surveys at each sentinel surveillance site to define the incidence of both hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARI. a more economical and perhaps more accurate approach would be to use data from one well-executed healthcare utilization survey. country-level influenza disease estimates will become increasingly important to ministries of health over the coming years. countries will need representative and ideally country-specific data to make decisions about treatment and preventive strategies, including targeted vaccination with currently available influenza vaccines.
