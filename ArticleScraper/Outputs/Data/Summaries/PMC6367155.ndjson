{"summary": "attachment factors serve to bind the viral particles and thus help to concentrate virus onto the surface of susceptible cells. on the cell surface, the virus specifically binds to the viral receptor and initiates cell entry by activating signalling pathways and promoting endocytic internalization. a complete circulation route for viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vector in a persistent-propagative manner starts from the viral entry into midgut epithelia. a complete circulation route for viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vector in a persistent-propagative manner starts from the viral entry into midgut epithelia. viruses then replicate inside the infected cells and spread to adjacent gut cells, passing through the gut barrier to disseminate into the haemolymph. a plant arbovirus hitchhikes a well-defined insect ligand-receptor interaction pathway to achieve its cell entry. a plant arbovirus hitchhikes a well-defined insect ligand-receptor interaction pathway. this represents a previously undescribed mechanism for the arboviral invasion of vector cells. we hypothesize that RSV may break the L. striatellus ovarian barrier by entering nurse cells through Vg receptor (VgR)-mediated endocytosis. in this study, we provide new evidence of VgR's function in mediating the invasion of nurse cells, further confirming this novel viral cell-entry mechanism. insect VgR characteristics [35], epidermal growth factor-like domains and YWXD amino acid repeats (figure 1a) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) with the VgR-specific primers VgR-QF/VgR-QR (primer sequences listed in electronic supplementary material) in immature female ovaries of final-instar nymphs and in the early previtellogenic period, VgR continued its dramatic rise during the vitellogenic periods. in other tested tissues of female adults, including fat body, midgut, salivary glands and haemocytes, VgR was at very low or undetectable levels. treated L. striatellus showed a 73% lower RSV titre in the ovaries. 79% of the insects showed RSV infecting most parts of the germarium (type C infection level), 17% showed RSV RNPs (filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles) in the anterior part of the germarium (type B), while only 4% showed no RSV RNPs in the germarium (type A) a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout or cultivable L. striatellus cell line will be used in the future to clarify the function of the Vg\u2013VgR endocytic machine in RSV cell entry. both VgR knockdown efficiency and the RSV titre were measured 48-h posteclosion. the dsVgR-treatment of L. striatellus ovarioles impeded the ability of RSV to infect L. striatellus ovarioles. each number represents one ovary dissected from one insect. in each experiment, 15\u201320 insects per group were analysed. the influence of VgR on the ability of RSV to invade an ovary is dependent on Vg. the influence of VgR on the ability of RSV to invade an ovary is dependent on Vg. the influence of VgR on the ability of RSV to invade an ovary is dependent on Vg. gold-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG against VgR used to detect the virus. yellow arrow, 10-nm gold-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG against VgR. model in which RSV crosses the ovarian barrier. the first work to describe an insect ligand's receptor-mediated endocytosis. the virus hitchhikes an existing ligand-receptor pathway. in insects, other atypical pathways have also been reported to facilitate viral cell entry. insect Vg aids in ovarian infection by other viruses or endosymbionts. the yolk-uptake machinery helps the bacteria colonize the insect germ line. the whitefly Bemisia tabaci transmits Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) Y.H., Y.Y., Q.L., M.Z., D.L., X.C., L.Z. and R.F.
