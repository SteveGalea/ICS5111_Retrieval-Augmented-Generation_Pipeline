{"summary": "the causative agents, Ebola virus and Marburg virus, are considered to be high level biothreat agents by the united states. there are no effective vaccines to be used as prophylactics and no effective antiviral interventions to manage the diseases. the pipeline of candidate anti-filovirus therapeutics is limited. however, promising work on inhibition of the virus entry into their host cells with small molecules,21 recombinant C type lectins13,22 or immuno-adhesion technology,23 disruption of viral RNA capping24. osine analog EBOV S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase BALB/c mice 3 days post-exposure, 100% protection 14 FGI-103 Small molecule EBOV Unknown C57BL/6 mice 1 day post-exposure, 60% protection 15 MARV BALB/c mice 1 day post-exposure, 100% protection FGI-104 Small molecule EBOV Unknown C57BL/6 mice Post-exposure, 100% protection 16 Broad- only a few small molecule antivirals have been shown to have in vivo efficacy against filoviruses. the other two families target host enzymes, the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER -glucosidases I and II) the morphogenesis of filoviruses appears to depend upon ER -glucosidases mediated processing of envelope glycoproteins. due to their unusual antiviral mechanism, imino sugars should be complementary to the other antiviral approaches and have the advantage of being broadly active. the ER -glucosidase inhibitors are thus in a rare group. they have been shown to have selective antiviral activity for multiple enveloped viruses in tissue cultures and, in several cases, in animal models. the ER -glucosidase inhibitors are thus in a rare group. cells in culture can tolerate complete shutdown of these ER -glucosidases. people can tolerate long-term treatment with glucosidase inhibitors. there are troubling adverse effects (i.e., gastric distress) which must be taken into consideration. inhibition of ER glucosidases prevents polypeptide interaction with Calnexin and results in polypeptide misfolding, retention and/or degradation. glucosidase inhibitors have been approved for the management of type II diabetes, Gaucher's disease. imino sugar glucosidase inhibitors have been identified as glucosidase inhibitors. some of them have been successfully used to treat human diseases. glucosidase inhibitors are limited by side effects and poor pharmacokinetic properties. imino sugar derivatives inhibited dengue virus59,60,61,62 and japanese encephalitis virus 67 in mice. reduction of viremia by even 1\u20132 logs has been anticipated to significantly improve clinical outcomes by reducing the severity of disease. all nascent glycoproteins contain three terminal glucose residues at the distal termini of their N-glycans following transfer of the oligosaccharide to the protein by way of the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase. the ER chaperons recognize monoglucosylated N-glycans and then \u2018fold' the nascent glycoprotein after which it is further processed by mannosidases and transferred to the Golg glucosidase inhibitors prevent the interaction of nascent N-glycoprotiens with calnexin and calreticulin and cause misfolding and degradation. glucosidase inhibitors prevent the interaction of nascent N-glycoprotiens with calnexin and calreticulin and cause misfolding and degradation. idase inhibition, and are two completely different viruses.8,94,95,96 hepatitis B virus has a DNA genome and is a human pararetrovirus that grows primarily in non-liver cells. both, however, acquire their envelopes by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum. if compounds with off-target activity are advanced, these activities must be monitored. glucosidase inhibitors could provide a powerful option in the treatment tool kit."}
