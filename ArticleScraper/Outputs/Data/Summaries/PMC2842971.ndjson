{"summary": "phage display has developed rapidly and become an increasingly popular tool for basic research such as the exploration of protein-protein interactions networks and sites [2\u20134]. the protein used to screen the phage display library is termed as target and the genuine partner binding to the target is called template. mimotope is a molecule able to bind to the antigen combining site of an antibody molecule, not necessarily identical with the epitope inducing the antibody. target-unrelated peptides (TUP), a term coined recently by menendez and Scott in a review [12], may be a mixture of target-unrelated peptides and mimotopes. however, target-unrelated peptides are not appropriate candidates for the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. menendez and Scott reviewed a collection of target-unrelated peptides recovered in the screening of phage-displayed random peptide libraries with antibodies. they divided their collection into several categories according to the component of the screening system to which target-unrelated peptides bind. they also derived one or more TUP motifs for each category. the core program of SAROTUP was sar.pl, a CGI script coded with Perl. in this script, the 23 TUP motifs were converted to regular expressions. the first data set contains 8 cases; 6 of them are sourced from test cases used in extant programs for mimotope-based epitope mapping [15\u201323] the target of each case in the first data set is monoclonal antibody and the structure of antigen-antibody complex has been resolved. for each case, there is one or more sets of peptides recovered from phage display technology. the second data set is composed of 100 peptides in raw sequence format. the first group has 77 sequences compiled from the first data set without any known TUP motifs. the second group has 23 sequences sourced from [12, 13] with various TUP motifs. TUP Pattern Mechanism in brief Capturing agents H-P-[QM], G-D-[WF]-x-F, W-x-W-L, E-P- Binding to streptavidin D-W-[FY], D-V-E-x-W-L, E-P- Binding to biotin W-[TS]-[LI]-x(2)-H-[RK] Binding to contaminant bovine serum albumin the first data set contains 8 cases; 6 of them are sourced from test cases used in extant programs for mimotope-based epitope mapping [15\u201323]. the target of each case in the first data set is monoclonal antibody and the structure of corresponding antigen-antibody complex has been resolved. a new panel of peptides excluding TUP was produced. the second data set is composed of 100 peptides in raw sequence format. the first group has 77 sequences compiled from the first data set without any known TUP motifs. the second group has 23 sequences sourced from [12, 13] with various TUP motifs. a new panel of peptides excluding target-unrelated peptides can be downloaded from the hyperlink created by the SAROTUP server. the new panel of peptides excluding target-unrelated peptides can be downloaded from the hyperlink created by the SAROTUP server. s were found; 4 of them were due to binding to plastic. the left 3 were due to binding to the Fc fragment. mapitope or PepSurf were used because there are only four or three peptides in the panel. Target Prediction without SAROTUP procedure Genuine epitope Prediction with or without SAROTUP procedure. the number of true positive residues increased from one to eight in the cetuximab case with SAROTUP procedure. when it came to the b12 case, the number of true positives increased from one to eight. however, when the distance parameter was adjusted from default to 10, SAROTUP increased the number of true positive residues from eight to eleven. a table of target-unrelated peptides and a new panel of peptides excluding TUP was produced at the same time by SAROTUP. it is true that some target-unrelated peptides can be identified through control and binding competition experiments. using SAROTUP first will certainly save a lot of labor, money, and time. Riemer et al. synthesized two-vaccine constructs with the peptide QYNLSSRALK and VWQRWQKSYV. they found either the cetuximab or the antibodies induced by the QYNLSSRALK vaccine construct inhibited the growth of A431 cancer cells significantly. a true TUP cannot be detected by SAROTUP at present. the user should customize the scan according to their experiment. this will prevent SAROTUP from reporting peptides bearing the Fc-binding motifs as TUP. a match might mean that different research groups have isolated the same peptide with a variety of targets. the lower section of the form has a series of options (Figure 2). it includes three drop lists for the screening target, screened library, and screening solid phase. by default, SAROTUP will scan each peptide against all the known 23 TUP motifs. the users can customize their scan according to their experiment at this section. 7 target-unrelated peptides were found; 4 were due to binding to plastic. the left 3 were due to binding to the Fc fragment. mapitope or PepSurf [15, 21, 22] were used to perform mimotope-based epitope prediction. mapitope was used because many peptides in the two cases exceeding the length limit of PepSurf. if a predicted residue is identical with a residue in the true epitope, it is underlined. the number of true positive residues increased from one to eight in the cetuximab case. when it came to the b12 case, the number of true positives increased from one to eight. when the distance parameter was adjusted from default (i.e., 9 ) to 10, SAROTUP increased the number of true positive residues from eight to eleven. if target-unrelated peptides are taken as mimotopes, (2) SAROTUP can improve the performance of mimotope based epitope mapping. the second data set has 100 peptides, varying from 6 to 22 residues long. a table of target-unrelated peptides and a new panel of peptides excluding TUP was produced at same time by SAROTUP. Riemer et al. screened a phage-displayed random peptides library with the cetuximab. the result suggested that the peptide VWQRWQKSYV might be a TUP. Riemer et al. synthesized two-vaccine constructs with the peptide QYNLSSRALK. to reduce this kind of false negatives, we are constructing a database for target-unrelated peptides and mimotopes. the database-based search can find out the known TUP without known motifs. it is also possible that a predicted target unrelated peptide is actually target-specific."}
