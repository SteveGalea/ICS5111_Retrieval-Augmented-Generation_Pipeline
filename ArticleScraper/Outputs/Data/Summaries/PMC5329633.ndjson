{"summary": "she presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and bony pains of 2 days duration. her past medical history was relevant for left nephrectomy in 2012 for staghorn calculus, caesarian section 3 times, and abortion once. she was obese and had been newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 but was not on any diabetic medication. a weaning trial was planned with sedation cessation, methylprednisolone tapered to 40 mg IV every 6 hours and peginterferon Alpha-2a and ribavirin were discontinued. she remained hemodynamically stable, her respiratory function and radiological features showed significant improvement on her chest consolidation. on day 13, the patient became polyuric with a urine osmolarity of 95, serum osmolarity of 341, urine sodium less than 20, a follow up brain CT scan showed complete loss of gray and white matter differentiation of both cerebral hemispheres with large frontal hematoma. contrast enhanced CT images showed no enhancement of intracranial vessels beyond the intracranial supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid arteries. on day 111 of ICU admission, she had a cardiac arrest and was declared dead on the same day. brain computed tomography scan showed complete loss of gray and white matter differentiation of both cerebral hemispheres with large frontal hematoma. total effacement of extra axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces including lateral ventricles and basal cisterns. risk factors for the development of severe disease include obesity, diabetes, and cardiopulmonary diseases. it is expressed in large numbers in obese people compared with non-obese individuals. on the day she developed spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage her blood sugar level was 25 mmol/L. this may be a modifiable risk factor and needs emphasis on strict glycaemic control in the management of MERS-CoV patients. the upper, lower respiratory tracts and other body parts for example, serum, urine, stool, and cerebral spinal fluids are recommended to understand the viral replication kinetics and guide the infection control. no CSF sample of MERS-CoV could be observed in this case due to tonsillar herniation."}
