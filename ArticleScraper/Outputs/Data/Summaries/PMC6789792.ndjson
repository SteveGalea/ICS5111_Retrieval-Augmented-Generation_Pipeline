{"summary": "development of effective vaccines against important viral pathogens remains challenging. hurdles include identifying early markers of vaccine efficacy or adverse reactions, developing relevant antigens and adjuvants. the immune response to vaccines is highly complex, multifactorial and greater than the sum of the parts. antigen discovery and development Traditionally, mapping of immunodominant B cell epitopes required identification of the whole protein first, followed by the assessment of its fragments for reactivity with antibodies. advances in Omics approaches, such as protein microarrays to map the reactivity of antibodies and T cells to antigens, have greatly helped in antigen discovery. high-throughput in vitro assays combined with structure-function analyses have been successfully used to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against influenza HA stalk, HIV V2 and V3 glycans and Dengue envelope protein [10,11,12]. graft linear as well as discontinuous HIV epitopes on to computationally designed scaffolds to develop designer antigens. a standalone antigen-based vaccine will not elicit CD8 positive T cell response unless cross-presentation is engaged. this limitation has been overcome significantly by vaccines based on viral vectors, DNA vaccines and adjuvants that facilitate cross-presenting dendritic cell recruitment. however, current methods of predicting vaccine efficacy rely on measuring the antibody quantity and quality for several reasons. the predictive CD8+ T cell signature included the expression of complement protein C1qB and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4. the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) was among the genes that emerged in the antibody response signature. the \u2018immunologic signatures\u2019 representing a broad range of cell states and perturbations within the immune system have been compiled in MSigDB. the \u2018immunologic signatures\u2019 representing a broad range of cell states and perturbations within the immune system have been compiled in the collection of annotated gene sets for use with gene set enrichment tools. networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids and sterol metabolism, especially the sterol regulatory binding protein 1, are key predictors of antibody and T cell responses. this approach is broadly applicable to study vaccine responses and identify predictors of efficacy. the current understanding of adjuvant function is that they induce controlled inflammation and recruitment of antigen presenting cells. the current understanding of adjuvant function is that they induce controlled inflammation and recruitment of antigen presenting cells. however, details of how this leads to specific types of adaptive immunity are not understood. transcriptional profiles of alum, CAF01, IC31 and GLA-SE were studied using genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of whole blood (WB) and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) in mice at early time points post immunization. large variations in transcriptional profile, both in magnitude and kinetics, were observed among these adjuvants. systems-level analysis of immune responses to vaccines has generally depend on datasets generated from PBMCs, molecular measurements from serum and profiling of immune cells. if successful, discovery and use of molecular signatures of protection or adverse effects of new vaccines can save resources, accelerate vaccine research and development, reduce the length and cost of clinical trials.
