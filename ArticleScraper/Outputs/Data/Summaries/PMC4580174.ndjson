{"summary": "astroviruses are small, nonenveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA [(+)RNA] genome (2). the virus genome has three open reading frames (ORFs), named ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2. ORF2 encodes nsp1a, a nonstructural polyprotein precursor that is processed by viral and cellular proteases (2). the association with membranes provides advantages to virus replication. it protects replicating RNA from cellular nucleases, conceals replication-intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thus preventing the induction of innate immune responses. a proteomic approach was used to identify the cellular proteins associated with this membrane population. astrovirus RNA replication and particle assembly take place in association with potentially different cellular membranes. astrovirus RNA replication and particle assembly take place in association with potentially different cellular membranes. recombinant astrovirus Yuc8 proteins 1a-3 (amino acid residues 401 to 638 of nsp1a) and 1b-2 (amino acid residues 201 to 362 of nsp1b) were produced in our laboratory. the recombinant protein E4 (amino acid residues 666 to 782 of VP90) has been described previously. odixanol interface were collected, pooled, and stored at 80\u00b0C. the proteins in the collected samples were analyzed by Western blotting. membrane fractions were continuously collected in 96-well microtiter plates at 4 ml/well. bovine serum albumin (BSA) was blocked with 50 l of this buffer for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the plates were then washed three times with PBS\u20131% BSA. the phosphatase substrate (1 mg/ml of p-nitrophenylphosphate [Sigma] in 1 mM MgCl2 buffer, pH 9.8) was added. the samples were centrifuged at 1,500 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was then aspirated, and the pellet was dried overnight. the samples were prepared, digested, and analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC)-tandem mass spectrometry. peptide identifications were accepted if they exceeded the specific database search engine thresholds, calculated as 10 log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match between the experimental data and the database sequence is a random event. X! Tandem identification requires at least log(expected) scores of greater than 2.0. caco-2 cells were transfected with siRNAs using an Amaxa electroporation system. one and a half million cells and 1.5 g of siRNA were used per electroporation. the cells were washed twice with minimum essential medium (MEM) and infected with astrovirus at an MOI of 5. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit and Maxima SYBR green quantitative PCR master mix. the primers used to amplify ARF6, ARL1, DHCR7, CYP51A1, FASN, PI4KIII, PI4KIII, CDS2, ITPR3, DDX23, EIF6, and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate de small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; smart pools) were purchased from GE Healthcare Dharmacon. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal and anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies were purchased from perkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to HAstV (Yuc8 strain) was previously described. c8 virus followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin polyclonal antibody. the binding of the secondary antibody was revealed with the substrate 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) the membrane pellets were resuspended in 150 l of TN buffer. the plate was then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20131% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and blocked with 50 l of this buffer for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the plates were then washed three times with PBS\u20131% BSA. FFZE fractions 17 and 18, 44 and 45, 46 and 47, 48 and 49, 52 and 53, and 78 and 79 were selected on the basis of the presence or absence of viral RNA. 1.2 ml (600 l of each of the two fractions) was mixed with 240 l of Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), 100 l 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, and 100 l iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. oxidation of methionine was specified as a variable modification. iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. the protein-protein interaction network was visualized using the Cytoscape program (version 3-0-2 [http://cytoscape.org]) (33), which includes experimental evidence of protein interactions, protein interaction databases, and text mining co-occurrences. the protein-protein interaction network was visualized using the Cytoscape program (version 3-0-2 [http://cytoscape.org]) total extracted cellular RNA was reverse transcribed with superScript III reverse transcriptase (invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using oligonucleotides Mon344() or Mon343(+) (23, 36), yielding an amplicon of 316 bp. qRT-PCR analysis. FFZE separates membrane-associated proteins from astrovirus-infected Caco-2 cells in three different populations. astrovirus Yuc8 RNA polymerase in low-density fractions of iodixanol gradients of virus-infected Caco-2 cell homogenates suggests its association with cellular membranes. infectious virus and viral components are present exclusively in FFZE membrane population II. the presence of astrovirus proteins, RNA, and infectious viral particles was determined. the distribution of the structural protein VP90 and the nonstructural protein nsp1a was detected by ELISA with antibodies to purified viral particles. RNA was extracted from pooled FFZE fractions. reverse transcription was performed with oligonucleotide Mon343(+) or mon344(). PCR was carried out with the same pair of oligonucleotides. infectious virus was mainly detected in fractions 42 to 55. the highest viral titer was found between fractions 46 and 49 of membrane population II. RNA replication and the assembly of new viral particles occur in association with membrane population II, particularly in fractions 46 to 49. astrovirus capsid protein and nonstructural polyproteins nsp1a and nsp1b were found in fractions 44 to 53 of infected cells. viral proteins are present exclusively in membrane population II. analysis focused on pooled fractions 48 and 49. proteins identified in FFZE fractions 48 and 49 of infected and uninfected cells were determined and mapped in a protein-protein interaction network using the String database. most of the functional characteristics of these proteins, as expected, were shared between infected and uninfected cells, suggesting that astrovirus infection does not perturb, at least significantly, cell metabolism. mock-infected and Yuc8-infected cells Glucose catabolic process Both mock-infected and Yuc8-infected cells Regulation of translation initiation Both mock-infected and Yuc8-infected cells Molecular functions Cytochrome c oxidase activity Mock-infected cells Nucleic acid binding Mock-infected cells A acetyltransferase activity Yuc8-infected cells infected cells showed a distribution of the origin of cellular membranes. proteins associated with membranes of different origins were detected in all three populations. of interest was the diversity of proteins detected in fractions 48 and 49 of population II. sylation factor 6 [ARF6], aDP-ribosylation factor-like protein 1 [ARL1]), cholesterol synthesis (lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase isoform 1 [CYP51A1], 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase [FASN]), phospholipid metabolism (phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase and [PI4KIII and PI4KIII, respectively), 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase DHCR7 Cholesterol biosynthetic process (GO:0006695) Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 EIF6 Translation (GO:0006412) Fatty acid synthase FASN Fatty acid biosynthetic process (GO:0006633) Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 ITPR3 Phosphatidylinositol binding (GO the biological process in which the knocked-down genes are involved is indicated. the synthesis of viral genomic RNA (RNAg) and antigenomic RNA (RNAag) was determined by real-time qRT-PCR. the synthesis of viral genomic RNA (RNAg) and antigenomic RNA (RNAag) was determined. the expression of viral RNA was determined by real-time qRT-PCR. results represent the percent expression relative to that in cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA (nontargeting; Dharmacon) the amount of accumulated VP90 ranged from 33 to 69%. the greatest effect on VP90 synthesis was observed after the expression of FASN, ITPR3 and PI4KIII was knocked down. FFZE separates membrane-associated proteins from astrovirus-infected Caco-2 cells in three different populations. distribution of cellular membranes between these two experimental conditions may exist. these differences were most obvious in population III (Fig. 1). this population did not contain viral components. the distribution of viral proteins was also determined by immunoblotting. FFZE fractions were pooled and analyzed by Western blotting. RNA was extracted from pooled fractions and reverse transcription was carried out with oligonucleotide Mon343(+) to detect the negative-sense RNA or with oligonucleotide Mon344() to detect the positive-sense RNA. reverse transcription was performed with either oligonucleotide Mon343(+) or Mon344() to synthesize cDNA from negative- or positive-strand RNA. after inactivation of the reverse transcriptase, the synthesized cDNA was amplified by PCR using both the Mon343(+) and Mon344() primers in each case. both genomic and antigenomic RNAs were detected in fractions 44 to 49, supporting the fractions 17 and 18 (membrane population I) and 78 and 79 (membrane population III) were also analyzed for comparison of their proteins to the proteins associated with the fractions in population II. resulting fragment ion spectra were searched against those in databases of human proteins. gene ontology annotation of proteins identified in FFZE fractions 48 and 49 of infected and uninfected cells. gene ontology annotation of proteins identified in FFZE fractions 48 and 49 of infected cells. -infected cells Regulation of translation Mock-infected cells Respiratory electron transport chain Mock-infected cells Cell junction organization Yuc8-infected cells Cholesterol biosynthetic process Yuc8-infected cells De novo posttranslational folding Yuc8-infected cells Mitochondrial ATP synthesis-coupled proton transport Yuc8-infected cells De novo posttranslational folding. infected cells Acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase activity Yuc8-infected cells ATPase activity to transmembrane movement of ions Yuc8-infected cells a GO annotations were determined using the ClueGO plug-in in the protein-protein interaction network visualized by Cytoscape. membranes of different origins cosegregate with astroviral components in infected Caco-2 analysis was performed using Scaffold software (version 4) as described in Materials and Methods. 6 of the 11 proteins exclusively identified in fractions 48 and 49 of infected cells were selected to further characterize their possible participation in astrovirus replication. five more proteins present in fractions 48 and 49 were also characterized. the roles of the above-mentioned proteins in astrovirus replication were evaluated by knocking down expression of the cognate genes by RNA interference. at 72 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with Yuc8 (MOI, 5), and at 18 hpi the cells were subject to three freeze-thaw cycles and the viral. silencing of the expression of the CYP51A1, DHCR7, FASN, PI4KIII, and DDX23 genes reduced the yield of virus progeny between 40 and 50%. the viability of the cells, determined by an LDH activity release assay, was not affected. the reduction in gene expression induced by the corresponding siRNAs ranged from 40 to 80%. the ratio of RNAg to RNAag ranged from 1.2-fold (DDX23) to 5.3-fold (ITPR3). the ratio of RNAg to RNAag in cells treated with an irrelevant siRNA was about 200. the expression of viral RNA was determined by real-time qRT-PCR. the synthesis of the structural polyprotein VP90 in siRNA-transfected cells was evaluated by Western blotting. at 12 hpi, the amount of accumulated VP90 ranged from 33 to 69% compared to the amount that accumulated in cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. the greatest effect was observed after the expression of FASN, ITPR3, and PI4KIII was knocked down. structural and nonstructural astrovirus Yuc8 proteins and both RNAg and RNAag viral RNA species with cell membranes in nucleus-free extracts. a protein corresponding to the carboxy terminus of nsp1a was colocalized with viral RNA and calnexin (42, 43) membrane population II was found to be enriched in membranes from different organelles, including the Golgi apparatus, ER, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and nucleus. it may reflect the idea that the nuclear envelope is continuous with the ER membrane. further experiments are needed to define whether RNA replication and particle assembly occur in the same type of membrane or to modified membranes derived from different origins. FFZE fractions 48 and 49 from population II of infected cells were highly enriched in Yuc8 proteins and viral RNA. RNA interference of the genes encoding these 11 proteins showed that knocking down the expression of 6 of them reduced the yield of infectious virus. the moderate effect of siRNAs on the reduction of virus yield is also a factor to consider. the requirement of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis for astrovirus replication is not unprecedented. other (+)RNA viruses have also been shown to depend on the synthesis of these compounds. the replication of dengue virus was also shown to depend on the production of endogenous cholesterol. lipid droplets have been shown to be recruited to viral replication complexes in viroplasms (44) of interest, the neutral lipids stored in these organelles have been shown to be used to generate the energy likely required for the replication of HCV and rotavirus (63, 75). lipid droplets may also work as an energy source for astrovirus replication. the recruitment of PI4KIII to membranes increases the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids, resulting in a PI4P-enriched membrane microenvironment that enhances the recruitment of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which initiates RNA synthesis at these membranes. further studies are required to determine the mechanism through which PI4KIII contributes to the replication of astrovirus. esizes the RNAag using RNAg as the template. the RNAag is then copied into additional RNAg molecules. it also serves as a template to synthesize the subgenomic RNA."}
