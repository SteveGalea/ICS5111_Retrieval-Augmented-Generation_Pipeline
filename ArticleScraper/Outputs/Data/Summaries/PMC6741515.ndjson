{"summary": "IFN-s are a new distinct type of IFN found in 2003 by two independent groups. three closely positioned genes on human chromosome 19 were found to encode distinct but paralogous proteins. IFN-s and type I IFN-s are similar in their expression patterns and biological activities. IFN-1 gene is regulated by IRF3 and IRF7, thus resembling the IFN- gene. IFN-2/3 gene expression is mainly controlled by IRF7, resembling those of the IFN- genes. IFN types III and I induce a similar subset of genes, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56). the specificity of the IFN- response is regulated through limited receptor expression [8, 24]. IFN-1 had a stronger ability than IFN-2/3 to induce IL-12p40, TNF, and IL-10 production in monocyte-derived macrophages in response to R848 stimulation. no significant downregulation of genes was observed following IFN-1 stimulation. IFN-s lead to apoptosis or G1 phase arrest of cancer cells. not all cell lines have the same susceptibility to IFN-s. pDCs are the most IFN-responsive cell types in the periphery. mDCs matured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of IFN-1 secrete less IL-10 and more IL-12 than those not exposed to IFN-1 [60, 61] compared to IL-4 and IL-5, IFN-1 preferentially inhibits IL-13 production through a decrease in the Th2-restricted transcription factor GATA3 [63]. IL-4-responsive monocytes secrete IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-Ra) which then acts on pDCs to elevate their IFN-1 output. IL-4 and IFN-1 comprise a feedback loop which represents a natural checkpoint for the control of Th2 cytokine production. IFN- and Monocytes/Macrophages IFN-1 induces IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in human PBMCs. monocytes and macrophages are the major IFN-1-responsive cellular subsets. high levels of major MHC class I and MHC class II; express CCR7; low levels of costimulatory molecules; retained phagocytic ability induce partial maturation of mDCs 62 1, 2 mDC profoundly inhibit the generation of Th2 and Th17 responses. diminish the development of Th2 cells and lower the secretion of IL-13, and induce CD3+ T cell apoptosis inhibit Th2, promote Th1, and induce apoptosis 60, IFN-R is expressed in DCs, T cells, and NK cells. DCs can produce IFN-s in response to stimulation of TLRs. IFN-s can also affect DCs, resulting in the change of MHC, CCR7, and costimulatory molecules. s is not affected in vitro, but in vivo tumorigenicity is suppressed or completely abolished when cells are injected subcutaneously into mice [68, 79] suggesting that IFN-s engage host mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth. NK cells probably play a critical role in IFN-mediated protection against tumors. studies showed that IFN-1 induced myeloma cell growth and protected cancer cells from dexamethasone-induced cell death [81]. intraumoral injections of 400 ng IFN-1 did not mediate significant suppression of A549 growth in vivo [78]. the novel effects of IFN-2 on T cell differentiation are not observed in IFN-deficient mice or mice depleted of IL-12p40. IFN-s are likely the principal IFNs produced during innate responses to respiratory viruses in bronchial epithelial cells [88] and key modulators of the Th2 response [89] systemic Lupus Erythematosus IFN-1 mRNA expression and serum protein levels in patients with SLE are higher compared to normal controls. IFN-1 stimulates the production of CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL9 (MIG) and IL-8 by PBMCs from SLE patients. eosinophils express IFN-s that can induce intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. it remains to be further investigated whether IFN-s are involved in the development of oral tolerance or food allergy. IFN--DCs can play a role in the generation of antitumor T cell immunity. the therapeutic efficacy could be augmented and the side effects could be reduced when both IFN types are used in combination."}
