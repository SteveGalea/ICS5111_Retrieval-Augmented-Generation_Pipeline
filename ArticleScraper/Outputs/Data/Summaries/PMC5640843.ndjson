{"summary": "TGEV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality rates as high as 100% in piglets less than 2 weeks old. in adult pigs, the disease is often unapparent or mild (2). EMT is accompanied by reduced expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, claudins, occludin, desmoplakin, and cytokeratin-8, -18, and -19. increased expression of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, vitronectin, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP) and smooth-muscle actin (12). Flow cytometry showed that nearly 8% of IPEC-J2 cells in generation 1 (G1) were positive for TGEV, but the number of infected cells was dramatically lower in G2 to G5. supernatants from G1 to G5 were diluted 1:1,000 and tested by a plaque assay. normal IPEC-J2 cells have a characteristic cobblestone shape with clear boundaries, along with other features common to epithelial cells. after infection by TGEV, cells become partly spindle shaped, and some appear as irregular polygons. RT-PCR was therefore used to quantify expression levels of EMT-related markers in mock-infected and TGEV-infected cells. expression levels of the mesenchymal cell markers N-cadherin, -catenin, twist, and snail were significantly increased in TGF-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV-infected cells showed marked increases in N-cadherin, -catenin, and twist expression levels. RT-PCR measured expression levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, TGF-, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in TGEV-infected cells. TGEV infection promotes cell migration and invasion. phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was examined. phosphorylation increased for all three proteins in infected cells. total protein levels were unchanged. TGEV-infected cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 for 24 h. extracts from harvested cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies against E-cadherin, vimentin, p-GSK3. TGEV infection increases adhesion of ETEC K88 and expression of integrin 5 and fibronectin. treatment with SB431542 significantly reduces adhesion of ETEC K88. integrin 5 and fibronectin levels responded similarly. integrin 5 (B) or fibronectin (C) by flow cytometry. results are expressed as the fluorescence intensity of cells expressing integrin 5 or fibronectin among the total acquired cells. data are expressed as means standard errors from three independent experiments. atants from G1 to G5 were diluted 1:1,000 and tested by a plaque assay. number of plaques detected in G2 through G5 was lower than the number detected in G1. IPEC-J2 cells were monitored over succeeding generations to determine fraction of infected cells. TGEV-infected versus uninfected IPEC-J2 cells undergo EMT. RT-PCR analysis of relative mRNA expression levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, -catenin, twist, snail, and smad. both TGF- treatment and TGEV infection were associated with a decreased level of E-cadherin, which is an epithelial marker. levels of vimentin, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (p-GSK3), -catenin, and twist were also examined by immunofluorescence staining. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-, and TNF- in uninfected cells. TGEV infection promotes cell migration and invasion. phosphorylation increased for all three proteins in in. TGEV-infected cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 for 24 h. cells treated with either inhibitor or both inhibitors showed increased levels of E-cadherin. in contrast, the inhibitors significantly decreased the levels of vimentin, p-GSK3, -catenin, and twist. IPEC-J2 cells were exposed to latex beads with sizes of 0.03 m, 0.1 m, and 2 m or DyLight 488-labeled TGEV (DY488-TGEV) levels of uptake of DY488-TGEV and 0.1-m latex beads were similar. pathogens, binds to membrane-spanning receptor integrins, which mediate bacterial adhesion and invasion. integrin 5 was higher after TGEV infection but was reduced when SB431542 was added. expression levels of integrin 5 and fibronectin are increased by TGEV infection. infected pigs were analyzed by Western blotting. the level of E-cadherin was significantly lower in TGEV-infected pigs. vimentin, integrin 5, and fibronectin levels were dramatically higher. -catenin, a type III intermediate filament protein, binds tightly to the actin cytoskeleton through -catenin and -catenin. the loss of E-cadherin deconstructs cell junctions but also induces the remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins. -catenin is normally quiescent in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. inflammation leads to the sustained activation of NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- may synergistically provide a nudge toward TGF--induced EMT. the PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways can be regulated by TGF-. increased integrin 5 and fibronectin levels were also observed during TGEV-induced EMT. however, SB431542 significantly reduced ETEC K88 adherence and the expression of integrin 5 and fibronectin. this suggests that TGEV infection induces EMT. TGEV was propagated in swine testicular (ST) cells and stored at 70\u00b0C. titers were determined by serial dilution and plating onto solid medium. IPEC-J2 cells were purchased from the DSMZ (Germany) tGF- is an inducer of EMT in normal mammary epithelial cells (24) to induce EMT, IPEC-J2 cells were cultured in T25 cell culture flasks for 24 h, serum starved for 24 h, and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml porcine TGF-. cDNA was synthesized by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the total protein concentration was determined by using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (RIPA) buffer containing 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the total protein concentration was determined by using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay.
