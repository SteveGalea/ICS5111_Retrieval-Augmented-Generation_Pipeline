{"summary": "the occurrence of BEN has been recorded with a high prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. the first cases were described in 1956 in Bulgaria, where Tanchev et al. published the first detailed clinical description of the new entity. in 1961, it was found that a similar nephropathy was also prevalent in Romania. epidemiological studies reported an increase in the prevalence of BEN between 1967 and 1970, a steady state between 1970 and 1984 and ultimately a decrease in some endemic areas. in another endemic area, a decreasing incidence over time was found during a follow-up period spanning the time period 1978 to 1997. extreme kidney atrophy has been proposed as a criterion for the diagnosis of BEN. some studies suggest that the smallest kidneys are found in advanced stages of BEN. in the offspring of a mother with BEN, ultrasound measurements seem to portend a prognostic value. glomerular lesions are associated with periglomerular fibrosis, glomerular lesions, including ischaemic, microcystic, obsolescent glomeruli, occasional thrombotic microangiopathy-like lesions and focal segmental sclerosis-like lesions. diagnostic criteria There are no diagnostic features which could be marked as pathognomonic of BEN. the high prevalence rate of haemodialysed patients with BEN indicates that BEN is not disappearing [10] despite intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time [11] despite intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. extreme kidney atrophy has been proposed as a criterion for the diagnosis of BEN. some studies suggest that the smallest kidneys are found in advanced stages of BEN. others have reported that this occurs in the earlier stages. periglomerular fibrosis, glomerular lesions, including ischaemic, microcystic, obsolescent glomeruli, occasional thrombotic microangiopathy-like lesions and focal segmental sclerosis-like lesions. diagnostic criteria There are no diagnostic features which could be marked as pathognomonic of BEN but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury is highly suggestive of this entity. metals (cadmium and lead) and metalloids (arsenic and selenium) do not play a role in the aetiology of BEN [30] metals (cadmium and lead) and metalloids (arsenic and selenium) do not play a role in the aetiology of BEN. 'Clematitis' derives from the Greek 'klema' for tendril, the growth form of this species of Aristolochia. the term 'birthwort' refers to the plant's use as an aid to birth. herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia spp. have been known since antiquity. endemic nephropathy is essentially caused by chronic poisoning with the seeds of A. clematitis [34]. the nephropathy has been ascribed to the ingestion of Chinese herbal remedies that have included species of the genus Aristolochia which were positively classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in the majority of cases, progression to end-stage renal disease occurred despite discontinuation of Chinese herbal remedies [38] and invasive urothelial carcinoma after exposure to Chinese herbal remedies containing AAs may occur even without severe renal failure [43] the CHN reported in Belgium presented as a rapidly progressive renal interstitial fibrosis leading to end-stage renal disease [44] within a few years, it emerged that CHN patients developed a high risk of UUC. the similarities between CHN and BEN have led to the hypothesis of a common aetiological agent for both diseases. the similarities between CHN and BEN have led to the hypothesis of a common aetiological agent for both diseases. this suggests that dietary ingestion of AA accounts for all epidemiological, clinical and pathophysiologic features of BEN and associated UUC. the frequency of neoplasms is decreasing from the upper towards the lower urothelium. it seems that the frequency of neoplasms is decreasing from the upper towards the lower urothelium. cytological screening procedures of UUC in AAN characterize the finding of giant multinucleated cells. TP53 mutations in DNA obtained from UUC in endemic regions of bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. TP53 mutations in urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter, worldwide. ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced renal disease and urothelial tumours in humans are highly similar. OTA is considered to be a human carcinogen, an opinion based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. no adequate human studies of the relationship between exposure to OTA, the human renal disease and cancer have been reported. AA\u2013DNA adducts were found in kidney tissues but adducts derived from OTA were not observed. these results demonstrate that presumably OTA-related DNA adducts do not play a key role in CHN or CHN-associated UUC [52, 55] and consequently in BEN and associated UUC. a study by Toncheva et al. in 4077 subjects from 417 families affected with BEN led to the conclusion that all patients with BEN belong to certain families. the risk of developing BEN is much higher in first-degree than second-degree relatives and decrease substantially in remote relatives. a study by Pavlovic in 1991 showed that a certain proportion of healthy subjects had a peculiar form of lipid abnormalities associated with an abnormal LCAT activity. a possible association between these abnormalities and the aetiology of BEN was raised for the first time. a marker for CYP3A5 expression in the human kidney is associated with increased risk of BEN, while CYP3A4*1B and CYP2D6 genotypes do not significantly modify the risk for the disease [85]. chromosomal aberrations It was hypothesized that the occurrence and frequent association of BEN and cancer can be explained by the chromosomal hypothesis of oncogenesis. tiology of BEN was published, suggesting that a slow coronavirus infection causes BEN in humans. four out of five biopsy specimens on extended culture yielded a coronavirus virus which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and vero cells. it was proposed that the microorganism was a novel coronavirus based on its cross-reactivity with the human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as a porcine aetiologies Pavlovic et al. tested the possible simultaneous role of coal-derived toxic organic compounds and decreased enzyme LCAT activity in the aetiology of BEN. well water from BEN villages contains higher concentrations of both extractable and high-molecular weight organic compounds compared with controls. no association between selenium deficiency and high incidence of BEN and UUC in endemic regions of Serbia was confirmed. the findings of a systematic 2-year follow-up study indicated that metals (cadmium and lead) and metalloids do not play a role in the aetiology of BEN. Ivi proposed that the aetiology of BEN could be related to chronic A. clematitis poisoning in which seeds from these plants intermingle with wheat grain during the harvesting process. he demonstrated in rabbit models that flour prepared from A. clematitis seeds induced a nephropathy. Stephania tetrandra was replaced by aristolochia fangchi (Guang Fang-Ji in Mandarin) since both plants are used in Chinese traditional medicine carrying similar names. the observed nephropathy has been ascribed to the ingestion of Chinese herbal remedies that have included species of the genus Aristolochia. AAs I and II are the most abundant of the AAs and are found in almost all Aristolochia species. AAs I and II are the most abundant of the AAs and are found in almost all aristolochia species. the accumulation of AA\u2013DNA adducts was present in the renal cortex and upper urinary tract of five patients with BEN from an endemic region in Croatia. a study of the incidence of UUC and urinary bladder tumours (UBTs) associated with BEN in the 30-year follow-up revealed a total of 575 urothelial neoplasms during the 10-year period, 1989\u20131998, compared with 659 in the period 1969\u20131988. a breakthrough in the identification of AA as an aetiological agent of the upper tract malignancy observed in BEN. the TP53 mutation spectrum in AA-induced UUC displays an unusual pattern that is readily distinguished from all other spectra that have emerged to date. ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced renal disease and urothelial tumours in humans are highly similar. it was one of the first well-elaborated hypotheses regarding the aetiology and pathogenesis of BEN that appeared in the literature in the early 1970s. no adequate human studies of relationship between exposure to OTA, nephropathy and cancer have been reported. OTA-related DNA adduct levels were 50 times lower than AA\u2013DNA adduct levels in female and male rats treated with the same slimming regimen. metals (cadmium and lead) and metalloids (arsenic and selenium) do not play a role in the aetiology of BEN. a deficiency of some essential trace elements, e.g. selenium, might be involved in the aetiology of BEN. tis is a compound word made up of \u00e1ristos\u2014fair, beautiful, and lochia\u2014menstrual periods. it refers to the use of the plant in aiding childbirth and was prescribed by the Greeks to women following delivery to facilitate a resuming of their periods. the species name, \u2018Clematitis\u2019 derives from the Greek 'klema' for tendril, the growth form of this species of Aristolochia. the English rabbit models demonstrated that flour prepared from A. clematitis seeds induced a nephropathy, which resembles the findings in BEN. endemic nephropathy is essentially caused by chronic poisoning with the seeds of A. clematitis. the outbreak of the so-called Chinese herb nephropathy (CHN) in 1993 affected more than 100 patients, mostly women, half of them requiring renal replacement therapy [41, 42] it was found that progression to end-stage renal disease occurred despite discontinuation of Chinese herbal remedies [38] and invasive urothelial carcinoma after exposure to Chinese herbal remedies containing AAs may occur even without severe renal failure. AAs I and II are the most abundant of the AAs and are found in almost all Aristolochia species [43]. AA\u2013DNA adducts persist for years in the renal cortex, serving as reliable biomarkers of exposure to AA. the similarities between CHN and BEN have led to the hypothesis of a common aetiological agent. in the 10-year period, 1989\u20131998, compared with 659 in the period 1969\u20131988. however, the frequency of neoplasms is decreasing from the upper towards the lower urothelium. it seems that the frequency of neoplasms is decreasing from the upper towards the lower urothelium. TP53 mutational spectra in urothelial carcinomas found in endemic regions of bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. TP53 mutations in DNA obtained from UUC in endemic regions of bosnia, croatia and syria. OTA is a toxic product of molds that belong to the aspergillus or Penicillium fungal genera. contamination frequencies of up to 40% have been encountered, at levels in the range of 5\u2013500 g/kg. OTA is a significant causal determinant of porcine nephropathy. OTA-related DNA adduct levels were 50 times lower than AA\u2013DNA adduct levels. in female and male rats treated with the same slimming regimen as the CHN patients. results demonstrate that presumably OTA-related DNA adducts do not play a key role in CHN or CHN-associated UUC. the familial clustering of the disease was indicative of the role of a hereditary predisposition in the aetiology of BEN. a study by Toncheva et al. in 4077 subjects from 417 families affected with BEN led to the conclusion that all patients belong to certain families. gene encoding LCAT is localized in region q 21\u201322 of chromosome 16. several mutations in all six exons have been described. no or extremely low LCAT activity in affected patients suggests expression of the disease is modulated by additional environmental factors and genes of minor importance. some studies showed that the CYP3A5*1 allele is associated with increased risk of BEN, while CYP3A4*1B and CYP2D6 genotypes do not significantly modify the risk for the disease. the significantly lower prevalence of the GSTM1 deletion homozygotes suggests that individuals bearing the GSTM1-null genotype could be better protected [86] some evidence of a viral involvement in the aetiology of BEN was published in 1975. it suggested that a slow coronavirus infection causes BEN in humans. four out of five biopsy specimens on extended culture yielded a coronavirus virus. a study by Toncheva et al. in 4077 subjects from 417 families affected with BEN led to the conclusion that all patients with BEN belong to certain families. the risk of developing BEN is much higher in first-degree than second-degree relatives and decrease substantially in remote relatives. gene encoding LCAT is localized in region q 21\u201322 of chromosome 16. gene encoding LCAT is localized in region q 21\u201322 of chromosome 16. gene encoding LCAT is localized in region q 21\u201322 of chromosome 16. extensive studies conducted in experimental settings and in BEN patients have investigated the role of several genetic polymorphisms in a number of enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, NQO1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, NAT1 and NAT2) from a detoxification system. some studies presented results demonstrating that the CYP3A5*1 allele is associated with increased risk of BEN. some evidence of a viral involvement in the aetiology of BEN was published in 1975. some evidence of a viral involvement in the aetiology of BEN was published. it was more recently documented when some authors were able to detect a novel coronavirus. studies are needed to clarify the nature of the 28.4 nm, non-enveloped virus particles found in the kidney cells of patients with BEN. this study is the first that clearly links BEN to a gene involved in the regulation of immune response. a multifactorial aetiology is associated with the multilevel distribution of causative agents within a pathogenetic chain of events. a significant proportion of the pathogenetic chain of events does not only take place in the renal and upper urothelial tissue as target organs."}
