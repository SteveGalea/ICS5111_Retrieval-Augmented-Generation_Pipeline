{"summary": "acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality among children worldwide. most patients with acute respiratory infection are still treated empirically. the aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients under 5 years old. these diseases are responsible for at least 6% of the world's disability and death. it is estimated that there are 33.7 million cases of respiratory infection annually among African children. longitudinal studies suggest that the overall mortality rate among children in developing countries is between 6.6% and 14.1%. the national referral hospital in the third district of the urban municipality of Antananarivo is paid for by the patients. the paediatric and neonatology ward of CENHOSOA has 54 beds and the annual number of children hospitalized for respiratory infection was estimated to be 150. a panel of multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used for the detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs. RNA and DNA were extracted from 140 l of each specimen using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit and QIAampMinElute virus kit. class 3: more than 25 cells and more than 25 PN, class 4: 10\u201325 cells and more than 25 PN and class 5: fewer than 10 cells and more than 25 PN. only the classes 4 and 5 present a high positive predictive value. if the laboratory determined that the sample was of oral origin it had been rejected. logistic regressions were performed to take into account confounders, bias and interactions involving pathogens linked to the dependent variable. five age groups were defined for the analysis: [0\u20135] months, [6\u201312] months,[13\u201318] months, [19\u201324] months, [25\u201336] months, >36 months. operating procedures had collected nasal and throat swabs, and sputum sample. specimens were transported within 30 minutes of sampling to the IPM. the prevalence of HIV in Madagascar is low, estimated to be around 1 per 1000 [7] sputum specimens were homogenized with an equal volume of Digest-EUR\u00ae on a vortex mixer. 10 l aliquots of homogenate were serially diluted in saline and 10 l aliquots were plated with a sterile inoculator on Blood Columbia agar with nalidixic acid and colistin. the threshold of significance was set at 107/ml (for one or two species only) data analysis Mono-infection was defined as the presence of only one pathogen as determined by viral and bacterial analysis. patients for which more than one pathogen was detected were considered to have co-infections. bronchiolitis was found more frequently among patients under 6 months old (55%, p0.01), LTRI and pneumonia were more frequent among patients aged over 12 months (respectively, 68% and 85%,p0.01) bronchiolitis was found more frequently among patients under 6 months old. income 85 (36.8) 30 (35.3) 55 (64.7) 0.20 182$ 182\u2013455$ 78 (78.8) 18 (23.1) 60 (76.9) >455$ 68 (29.4) 17 (25.0) 51 (75.0) Diagnosis on admission 145 (50.0) 38 (27.7) 99 (72.3) 0.51 Bronchiolitis Lower respiratory tract infection 60 (20.7) 20 (35.1) 37 (64.9) 0.33 Pneumonia 44 (16.1) 13 ( forty-nine (17%) patients had at least one underlying disease. some of the children had underlying conditions, particularly atopy (52;

192/273) and the [0\u20136] months age group had the highest risk. malnutrition and level of parental education both have an impact on the incidence of respiratory infections. in our study, only 3% of the patients died; this value is low. study population consists of patients from families with a socioeconomic level. infections in children aged less than 5 years raised issues about the indirect impact of influenza vaccination on respiratory infections. we advocate to further research in developing countries to document in more detail the impact of viral and bacterial co-infections on the prognosis of severe respiratory illness."}
