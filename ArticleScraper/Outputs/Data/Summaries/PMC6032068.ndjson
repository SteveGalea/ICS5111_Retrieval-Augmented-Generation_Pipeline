encapsulation of DNA in viral capsids has been also studied. the quorum sensing system was first discovered to control bioluminescence in the marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri. for low cell densities an homoserine lactone is secreted to the medium. for high cell densities it is accumulated inside when it triggers the transcription of luminescence genes. quorum sensing systems can be classified into several groups based on the type of auto-inducer used. acylated homoserine-lactone (AHL) is synthesized using the substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and an acyl-carrier protein (acyl-ACP) other types of homoserine-lactone synthase, LuxM and AinS, have been discovered in vibrio species. the third main category of autoinducers is AI-2, used by bacteria for interspecies communication. it regulates the production of virulence factors in Vibrio vulnificus [157,158,159], Serratia marcescens [159] and Clostridium perfringens [160]. however, the specific role of AI-2 in other species of bacteria remains unresolved. a signal turn over mechanism for DSF has been described [165,166]. different QS systems with hierarchical or parallel performance have been described [167]. the disruption of this bacterial communication systems is attracting a lot of interest. the most extensively studied QSI strategies to date are degradation and modification of the quorum sensing signals themselves. most enzymes identified thus far target AHL, although enzymatic inactivation of other signals has also been reported. the best studied QSI with this model of action are halogenated furanones. many medicinal plants, species such as garlic, ginger, essential oils of cinnamon and clove are also known to possess QSI activities. flavonoids such as baicalin, quercetin, naringenin, kempferol, apigenin have all been reported to be efficient in antagonizing bacterial QS. the anti-QS activity of silver nanoparticles has been the most widely studied. silver nanoparticles showed a reduction of AHL synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. anti-QS activity of silver NPs has been the most widely studied. the anti-QS activity of ATNPs was achieved at a concentration that was 20 times lower than the

TiO2 acted as a good supporting matrix, facilitating effective use of silver by reducing the concentration required for bioactivity. anti-QS activity was measured in the E. coli Top 10 biosensor. mechanisms proposed were inhibition of the autoinducer synthase. this could affect its union with the DNA promoter, or the blockage of the diffusion of AHL to the cytosol. ae to a non-biofilm forming non-virulence state was used to incorporate this compound into nanoparticles of polystyrene-block polyethylene glycol and vitamin E. these particles activated V. chlolerae quorum-sensing responses five orders of magnitude higher than the identically administered free CAI-1 does. co-encapsulation of other antimicrobial substances together with an antibiotic into liposomes could improve antimicrobial effic formulations including tobramycin and bismuth-ethanedithiol were evaluated as drug delivery systems with regards to quorum sensing and biofilm formation in various strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. the composition of niosomes included: Span 40, Tween 40 and 30% cholesterol. this reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of formulations including tobramycin in comparison with the non-encapsulated ones. quorum sensing interfering agents can be either natural or synthetic compounds, as well as small molecules, enzymes and antibodies. the most extensively studied QSI strategies to date are degradation and modification of the quorum sensing signals themselves and the use of autoinducer antagonists. lactonases, acylases and oxidorreductases are known classes of enzymes. they inactivate AHL by hydrolyzing the ester bond, causing the opening of the homoserinelactone ring. they modify but do not break AHL, transforming oxo-AHL into hidroxyAHL. some furanones are able to inhibit the synthase LuxS, the enzyme responsible for AI-2. many medicinal plants, species such as garlic, ginger, essential oils of cinnamon and clove are also known to possess anti-QS activity. flavonoids such as baicalin, quercetin, naringenin, kempferol, apigenin have all been reported to be efficient in antagonizing bacterial QS. silver nanoparticles showed a reduction of AHL bacterial synthesis in two soil Pseudomonas species at sub-inhibitory concentrations. but a species-dependence activity was observed in another study. silver nanoparticles also showed anti-QS activity against the biosensor Chromobacterium violaceum. cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides used as excipients for improvement of water-solubility and bioavailability of medicinal products. chitosan/pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) NPs loaded with kaempherol also inhibited the quorum sensing of Escherichia coli. yl-6-nitro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide is a lipophilic molecule. it was formulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and the anti-QS activity was evaluated. it was found that the loaded NPs were superior to the free QSI in the inhibition of pyocianin formation. encapsulation of other antimicrobial substances together with an antibiotic into liposomes could improve antimicrobial efficacy. only liposome formulation was able to suppress AHL production. niosome formulations included: Span 40, Tween 40 and 30% cholesterol. nanoparticles as carriers of QSI can overcome the unfavorable properties of many of these compounds. the metallic NPs show promising results in QS inhibition but also other compounds as tensioactives might have this activity."}
