{"summary": "ISG15 is one of the most abundantly-induced transcripts upon type I IFN treatment. it is synthesized as a 17 kDa precursor protein that is proteolytically processed into its mature 15 kDa form. the mature form of ISG15 contains a LRLRGG motif that mediates its covalent conjugation to target proteins, termed ISGylation. within two hours after type I IFN treatment, free ISG15 is detectable in cell lysates, followed by conjugate formation 12\u201316 hours later. the activating E1 enzyme, Ube1L, was initially identified by Robert Krug and colleagues. all members of the ISG15 conjugation cascade are upregulated by type I IFNs. ubiquitin is a dominant E3 ligase that coordinates the conjugation of the majority of substrates to ISG15. inhibition of Herc5 expression with siRNA abrogated greater than 90% of the ISG15 conjugate formation that was induced. many of the potential target proteins identified include proteins that play an important role in immunity and the host antiviral response, such as STAT1, JAK1, RIG-1, ISG56, PKR, and MxA. studies evaluating the impact of ISG15 overexpression/knockdown on viral growth in vitro. the mechanism by which ISG15 is regulating viral growth is unknown for the majority of these pathogens. in most overexpression studies, ISG15 and members of its conjugation cascade have been co-expressed, suggesting the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins is required for these antiviral effects.

ISG15/ mice were more susceptible to infection with Sindbis virus, influenza A and B virus, and HSV-1. the mechanism by which ISG15 is functioning as an antiviral molecule is unknown. recent studies have provided some insight into how ISG15 regulates the host antiviral response to some viruses. the authors failed to detect ISGylation of either HIV Gag or host Tsg101 directly. ISG15 interacted with Nedd4 and abrogated the transfer of ubiquitin to the active site of Nedd4. this prevented Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins including Ebola virus VP40. this prevented Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins. ps4 inhibited the interaction between Vps4 and its co-activator, LIP5. this prevented the formation of the oligomeric enzyme needed to disassemble the ESCRT complex and facilitate multiple rounds of budding. this prevented the formation of the oligomeric enzyme needed to disassemble the ESCRT complex. the authors identified seven lysines (K20/41/108/110/126/217/219) in the PR8 NS1A as potential ISGylation sites. the generation of mutant viruses carrying the K R mutations resulted in augmented viral growth in cultured cells and increased virulence in vivo. the mechanism by which ISG15 alters the function of several substrates has been identified. it appears that ISG15 can directly impact the function of the modified protein or it indirectly impacts its function by disrupting ubiquitination. it appears that ISG15 can directly impact the function of the modified protein. ISG15 modified host proteins to the antiviral activity of ISG15 are still under investigation. both retroviruses and filoviruses use the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT I\u2013III) pathway for viral egress. this prevented Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins. they extended these studies to VSV, a rhabdovirus which contains a similar L-domain and also interacts with Nedd4 ligase for efficient budding. authors identified seven lysines (K20/41/108/110/126/217/219) in the PR8 NS1A as potential ISGylation sites. the generation of mutant viruses carrying the K R mutations at either of these lysine residues resulted in increased viral growth in cultured cells and increased virulence in. a recent study by Durfee et al. found that NS1 is the only influenza viral protein modified during influenza virus infection. the authors proposed that viral proteins would be a primary target of ISGylation. they went on to demonstrate that the HPV16 L protein was ISGylated in transfection experiments. ISG15 negatively regulates the scaffold protein filamin B [30] unmodified filamin B facilitates type I IFN-induced apoptosis by recruiting RAC1, MEKK1, and MKK4 from the scaffold. this mechanism may protect uninfected bystander cells from IFN-mediated apoptosis, but this mechanism awaits further experimentation. the first identified immune evasion strategy targeting the ISG15 pathway was described by Robert Krug and colleagues while studying interacting partners for the influenza viral protein, NS1. the mechanism for this inhibition was mediated by the NS1/B gene, which non-covalently bound to ISG15. despite this evasion strategy, the ISG15/ and UbE1L/ mice are highly susceptible to influenza B virus infection. ISG15/ mice display almost no differences from mice following infection with wild type vaccinia virus. deletion of the E3 protein from the virus resulted in increased virulence in the ISG15/ mice. the remaining strategies have taken advantage of protease activity of different viruses to hydrolyze both ubiquitin and ISG15 from target proteins. significant progress has been made in identifying the components of the ISG15 conjugation cascade and identifying potential targets for ISGylation. despite this progress, many questions remain and will be the focus of future investigations. if the antiviral effects of ISG15 are due solely to modification of viral proteins, or if the modification of host proteins also contributes to this antiviral effect. the impact of ISGylation on these proteins and what is their fate remains unanswered."}
