{"summary": "the development of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies by means of laboratory animals has become a vital approach to protect against pathogenic contagions. polyclonal antibodies contain large and diverse concentrations of different antibodies with unknown specificities. they provide defense against transmissible diseases and can eliminate the infection. non-human polyclonal antibodies have revolutionized scientific research. production of monoclonal antibodies is based on the fusion of antibody generating spleen cells from immunized mice, rats, or rabbits with immortal myeloma cell lines. these monoclonal antibodies are a highly specific class of biological reagents that facilitate enhanced clinical diagnostics in the medical arena. the phage display technique was first established by George P. Smith. the first recombinant antibody fragments were constructed in bacteria 17 years ago. the goal of antibody production technology is to achieve high-titers of highly specific, and high-affinity antisera. polyclonal antibody Antigen interactions are essential for the normal functions of antibodies that are widely used in research or therapeutics. the antigen-specific and membrane-associated receptor antibody response is mediated by T and/or B cells. upon binding with a suitable antigen, B lymphocytes are induced to proliferate, and divide by a number of activating signals, thus increasing the number of B cells. monoclonal antibodies are clinically significant homogeneous and mono-specific scientific biomolecules produced from hybridoma cells by hybridoma technology. mAbs arise from single cell clone compared to multiple cell clones for pAbs. mAbs have been produced against a number of mycotoxins such as fumonisin B1 (Yuan et al., 2012; Ling et al., 2014, 2015b), citreoviridin (Jin et al., 2014, 2015b), marine toxins (Saeed and Wang, 2016), and other exo- and endo-antigens. ofi 2013 Relapsing form of multiple sclerosis (MS) Gazyva (obinutuzumab) Roche Roche 2013 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Remsima (infliximab [biosimilar]) N/A Celltrion 2013 Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis Per ra (tocilizumab) Roche Roche 2009 Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis Stelara (ustekinumab) Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson 2009 Plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease Removab (catumaxomab) N/A NeoPharm Group 2009 Malignant ascites Arcalyst (rilonacept) Regeneron Pharmaceutical hybridoma technology is a classical and established route of generating specific antibodies all around the globe. the technology begins with immunization of test animals with an antigen of interest and serum antibody titer is determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the spleen is aseptically removed and splenocytes fuse with myelo. hybridoma cells are then cultured in 96-well plates in the presence of hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) selection medium for high throughput screening. hybridoma cells producing desired antibodies are then screened by conventional ELISA and novel nanoparticle-probed immunoassay. nanotechnology and nanoparticles (NPs) use nanomaterials with length scale of 1\u2013100 nanometers (nm) nanomaterials have unique biological properties such as small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, sharp melting temperature, magnetic properties. NPs such as gold particles have been used to improve assay sensitivity and specificity of antibodies, low limit of detection (LOD), dose response over 10,000-fold and detection sensitivity by 1,000-fold compared to ELISA. sterile working conditions, antigen concentration, animal preparation, and injection quality must be confirmed. the inherent properties of antigen quantity include purification, animals to be immunized, type, and quality of the adjuvant. haptens (numerous myco- and marine toxins) is essential before immunization. animal is monitored daily or three times a week for side effects. pathological changes such as tissue reactivity, infection and anaphylactic reactions in case of booster injections have been reported. the volume of the immunogenic mixture depends on the quality of the antigen and the degree of the lesions formed. smaller volumes of mixtures are injected to induce antibody responses except when increased concentrations of antigen are required. the volume of FCA has lethal effects on animal physiology and the extent of lesions produced is associated with high volumes of FCA. ma technology, laboratory animals are immunized with an antigen of interest. specific antibody-producing B cells are fused with immortal myeloma cells. expansions of clonal populations are produced from sub-cloned individual hybridoma cells in a microtiter plate. anti-idiotype immunoassay, potency, and other appropriate methods are used to determine its identity and biological activity. applications of monoclonal antibodies MAb-based products exhibit superior specificity for a particular antigen. diagnostic applications include biochemical analysis and imaging. radioisotopes commonly used for labeling mAbs are iodine\u2014131 and technetium\u201499. the technique is also called immunoscintigraphy. a new class of individual specific (IS) autoantibodies have been documented in recent years. these autoantibodies are developed after birth and extend maximum in number by 2 years. autoantibodies collected from blood, saliva, semen and tears are used for detection. RANKPEP, nHLAPred, NetMHC, kernel-based inter-allele peptide binding prediction system (KISS) with support vector machine. these tools use databases that contain known epitopes from SYFPEITHI, MHCBN, LANL, and IEDB for protein epitope prediction. hybridoma cells are fused with myeloma cells to produce hybridoma cells. spleen is aseptically removed and splenocytes are fused with myeloma cells. hybridoma cells producing desired antibodies are screened by conventional ELISA. nanotechnology and nanoparticles (NPs) use nanomaterials with length scale of 1\u2013100 nanometers (nm) nanomaterials have unique biological properties such as small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, sharp melting temperature, magnetic properties. NPs such as gold particles have been used to improve assay sensitivity and specificity of antibodies. insignificant impurities (1%) can be immunodominant in case of various microbial antigens. they show non-specific activity against the antigens of interest and specific activity against impurities. higher concentrations of specific antibodies are obtained after purification. adjuvant is processed to form an immunogenic emulsion that is insoluble in water. the animal is monitored daily or three times a week for side effects. there is high risk of anaphylactic shock for booster injections by the i.v. or i.p. route. the volume of the immunogenic mixture depends on the quality of the antigen and the degree of the lesions formed. the immunization volume also depends on the animal species, route, and chemistry of the injection mixture. screening identifies and picks only specific antibody producing hybridomas. in hybridoma technology, laboratory animals are immunized with an antigen of interest. specific antibody-producing B cells are isolated from the spleen. then, expansions of clonal populations are produced from serially diluted sub-cloned individual hybridoma cells. immunochemical properties include binding assay, affinity, avidity, immunoreactivity (cross-reactivity with other structurally homologous proteins), analysis of CDR, epitope characterization, and determination of effector functions. specificity of mAbs is also checked. applications of monoclonal antibodies MAb-based products exhibit superior specificity for a particular antigen. radiolabeled\u2014mAbs are used in the diagnostic imaging of the diseases. radioisotopes commonly used for labeling mAbs are iodine\u2014131 and technetium\u201499. targeting agents in therapy Toxins, drugs, radioisotopes etc. can be attached or conjugated to the tissue-specific mAbs and carried to target tissues for efficient action. a new class of individual specific (IS) autoantibodies have been documented in recent years. tools for antibody selection include RANKPEP, nHLAPred, NetMHC, kernel-based inter-allele peptide binding prediction system (KISS) with support vector machine. other tools include position specific scoring matrices (PSSM) used for sequence alignment and IEDB analysis resource database. antibody development has progressed from hybridoma technology to a recombinant

the first study of recombinant antibodies in bacteria was difficult because of interference from disoriented proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm. a new antibody expression technique was developed to produce smaller antibody molecules. single-chain variable fragment (scFv) ScFv has high affinity, highly solubility, multi-domains, and high binding specificity with their target antigen. they are used for antibody engineering, biotechnology, cancer research, and biomedical applications. scFv have extensive applications in cancer therapeutics such as colon cancer, hepatocarcinoma, and diagnostics of human disease. scFv have been widely used with phage display panning to construct ligands to detect toxins produced by pathogenic entities. antibody repertoires from phage-displayed libraries are constructed by harvesting messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) from peripheral blood lymphocytes, hybridoma, spleen, bone marrow, tonsil. libraries are created using reverse transcribed (RT) process into cDNA to function as a template for antibody gene amplification (PCR) expression of scFv Numerous expression systems have been used for the successful isolation of scFv and display as fragments. the bacterial expression system is the most suitable and widely used method for the production of active scFv antibody fragments compared to other available expression strategies. biochemical characterization includes the expression of scFv antibody in a soluble form in infected E. coli cells. further characterization is carried out by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), mass spectrometry, sequencing and indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) assays. dual targeting with bispecific antibodies has gradually switched to combinatorial or cocktail therapy. this targeting technique is based on the targeting of multiple disease-modifying reagents with one drug. the application of a single, bispecific molecule is advantageous because it is less complicated to administer to patients, requires reduced preclinical and clinical testing. scFv (single chain fragment variable), Fv (fragment variable), Fab (antigen binding fragment) and their derivatives, V-gene domain, bispecific or bivalent antibodies, and other oligomers. Fab fragments are the linkage of VH\u2013CH and VL\u2013CL by disulfide bridges. recombinant antibody engineering and recombinant DNA technology has facilitated successful expression and cloning of widespread antibody fragments in bacteria (E. coli), mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), yeast (Pichia pastoris), plant (Arabidopsis), and insect cells (Drosophila melanogaster) these smaller fragments have several advantages over full-length antibodies such as tumor and tissue penetration, blood clearance, short retention times, and a method for rapid and effective high-affinity GFP-based antibody production corresponding to scFv was developed. it was demonstrated by inserting CDR3 into green fluorescence protein loops. scFv has high solubility and binding activity to antigen thermolabile hemolysin. phage recombinants are combined (linker orientation dependent) and cloned to construct a combinatorial scFv library for antigen selection. many scFv fragments have been constructed against haptens, proteins, carbohydrates, receptors, and tumor antigens for medical therapies and diagnostic applications. expression and activation of scFv is performed by appropriate folding and in vitro refolding for aggregation. the bacterial expression system is the most suitable and widely used method for the production of active scFv antibody fragments compared to other available expression strategies. libraries have been widely used for the construction of target-specific antibodies. scFv is a non-covalent heterodimer that consists of VH and VL domains. large libraries with a diverse range of antibodies and genes are created using reverse transcribed (RT) process into cDNA to function as a template for antibody gene amplification (PCR) phage display allows rapid selection of scFvs to isolate VH and VL chains for mAb transformation. therapeutic antibodies against noxious or highly conserved antigens can be obtained in their native conformation while avoiding animal immunization. individual clones are characterized after 3\u20135 rounds by DNA sequencing. scFv antibody characterization involves peptide mapping, glycan characterization analysis, purification, fragmentation of antibody pharmacokinetics. the scFv antibody is usually characterized by affinity, isotype, cross binding, phage-ELISA, and immunoblot. bispecific antibody The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6) proinflammatory cytokines cause multifactorial disease such as cancer and systemic inflammations. these factors are involved in redundancy of disease-mediation and crosstalk between signal cascades. bispecific antibody The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6) proinflammatory cytokines cause multifactorial disease. these factors are involved in redundancy of disease-mediation and crosstalk between signal cascades. antibody restricts its ability to infiltrate tumors. additional engineered antibody fragments include CDRs, Fab, F(ab')2, monospecific Fab2, bispecific Fab2, trispecific Fab3, monovalent IgG, bispecific diabody, trispecific triabody, scFv-Fc, minibody, new antigen receptor (IgNAR) domains in sharks, camelid heavy chain IgG (hcIgG), and Vh inovirus virions are 7 mm in diameter, contain circular DNA enclosed in a protein capsid. they enter host cells via pilli and are involved in genome replication. they undergo extensive recombination, act as vectors (phagemid) for gene transfer. PDT is the most commonly used in vitro technology. a feature of this technology is a direct physical link between genotype and phenotype of the displayed protein/variable antibody fragments. binders are amplified using an appropriate bacterial host cell such as E. coli. es are eluted and amplified after several rounds of biopanning. many factors including proper biopanning design, type of immobilized surface, binding time, washing, and antigen concentration affect the level of selection. several tests including ELISA, fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) and chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) are used to analyze this activity. scFv, Fab fragment, and VHH domains could be displayed on the phage successfully. the fusion of many ligands with phage particles has enriched phage displayed cDNA libraries significantly. new molecular recognition techniques have been established for screening functional molecules. antibodies against dendritic cells, white blood cells (WBC) (Fitting et al., 2011), hairy cell leukemia (Kreitman et al., 2012), hairy cell leukemia (Kreitman et al., 2012), myeloma protein (paraproteins) (O'Nuallain et al., 2007), clotting factors, AITP, GPIa, and GPIIIa antigens, CD autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), mixed cryoglobulinemia (CryoII), systemic sclerosis (SSc), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), vitiligo rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, Graves' disease (GD) and celiac disease (genetic inflammatory disorder) the isolation of peptides homing to all types of organs in the human body facilitated the isolation of peptides. this technique has assisted in the guided delivery of various peptides/drugs. about 80% of these peptides have not been reported to function in vivo. this inactivity was observed in peptides that recognized mouse double minute 2 homolog-p53 protein (MDM2/p53) the viruses enter host cells via pilli and are involved in genome replication. they act as vectors (phagemid) for gene transfer. they can integrate into the host genome by phage-encoded transposases and host-encoded XerC/D. screening of the displayed protein by antigen in vitro is analogous to the selection of protein fragments in natural immunity. the first step is the incubation of the display library with an immobilized surface (for example, microplate, magnetic beads, column matrix, column matrix, or immunotubes) of the entire cell. the development of an antibody library from immunized animals has become obsolete because of the construction of diverse universal single-pot libraries for the isolation of numerous antigens. the development of an antibody library from immunized animals has become obsolete because of the construction of diverse universal single-pot libraries. to obtain high-affinity targets, up to five rounds of biopanning are performed. DNA sequencing of the primary structure is carried out to produce individual clones of the target protein. the target is attached to a phage library that is immobilized on a solid surface. PDT has many applications in biotechnology, production of recombinant multifunctional antibodies, cancer, immunotherapeutics, and the enhanced validity of protein fragments. the study of epitopes and mimotopes in the interactions of antigen-antibody binding was the earliest application of PDT. anti-Rh (D) and anti-HPA-Ia bispecific diabodies developed by PDT. they are useful for hemagglutination assays. these diabodies are being used for the treatment of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. the technique has therapeutic uses in blistering skin diseases, pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus

with myeloma cells. the technology is a comparatively simple procedure with minimal cost for the steady production of native whole immunoglobulins. the technology has various limitations such as antibodies produced by the hybridoma technique are strictly murine proteins that limits their therapeutic use in humans. cell surface antigens exhibit a wide array of targets that are overexpressed, mutated or selectively expressed. the technology functions through engineering alterations in antigen or receptor function, the immune system i.e., altering Fc function and the antibody conjugated drug delivery system (DDS) targeting a specific antigen. in vitro studies, Fc engineering methods have been specifically designed to modulate ADCC, ADCP, and CDC envisioned for therapeutic mediation. natural killer (NK) cells exhibit essential role in immunity in the context of mAb treatment by exerting direct cytotoxicity toward infected or tumor cells. glyco-engineering technique has been used to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins with optimized efficacy, half-life, specificity, and antigenicity. the technique has been applied to in vivo expression systems that include mammalian cells, insect cells, yeast, and plants. display for lethal infections such as highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (Lei et al., 2016), cell tumor (Li et al., 2017) and human tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1). bacterial display systems comprised of a carrier protein as an anchoring motif, a target protein, and a host strain. the advantages of ribosome display over other cell based methods include displaying very large libraries, generating toxic, proteolytically sensitive and unstable proteins, and incorporation of modified amino acids or mutations at distinct positions. the large size of mAbs limits tumor penetration, and their long serum half-life is not suitable for therapy and imaging applications. engineered antibodies exhibit reduced half-life due to lack of an Fc domain and prevention of FcRn-mediated recycling. technology functions through engineering alterations in antigen or receptor function, the immune system i.e., altering Fc function and T cell activation. engineering the Fc region permits the development of molecules that are better suited to the pharmacology activity required of them. it involves modulation of constant Fc part of monoclonal human IgG1
