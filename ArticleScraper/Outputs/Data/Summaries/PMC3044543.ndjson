{"summary": "markov model simulating a stochastic simulation of epidemics approach for an outbreak in a hospital institution. based on preliminary data available at the time of writing, comparisons were made between 3 respiratory viruses: a SARS-like virus, a 1918 Spanish influenza\u2013like virus and a pandemic (H1N1) 2009\u2013type virus. results were number of patients infected, number of deaths, cost (in US$) per case prevented, and cost per death prevented compared to baseline where no preventive measures were implemented. sensitivity analysis was performed to understand impact of viral characteristics as well as different hospital response policies on cost-effectiveness outcomes. an outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from introduction by an HCW, a patient with undiagnosed infection, or a visitor in our hospital at base case will result in 2,580 infected patients at 30 days. with a 0.4% mortality rate, there would be 10 deaths from infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. alert level and disease No. infected No. deaths Additional cost Cost/case prevented Cost/death prevented Incremental cost/case Incremental cost/death None Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 2,580 10 25,200 Spanish influenza 3,210 161 80,000 SARS 825 83 99,200 Green Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 316 1 326,430 95 23,644 Spanish influenza 624 31 468,000 107 2,140 SARS 105 11 220,500 120 we assumed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has a lowered 50% transmissibility for atypical or subclinical cases (15) this rate effectively reduced the infected patients to 316 with only 1 death. this resulted in additional costs of $95 to prevent 1 additional infected patient and $23,600 to prevent 1 death. Sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that impacted the cost-effectiveness ratio most are case-fatality rate, patient exposure rate, and secondary attack rate. in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 scenario, the case fatality-rate ranging from 0.1% (seasonal influenza) to 10% (SARS) results in the cost per death averted moving from infinity to $35,000 per death averted (Orange Alert) the cost ranking is consistent with that predicted by base-case simulation. the actual incremental cost index is much higher, reflecting the higher cost for activating alert status in a bigger hospital. the lessons of the SARS epidemic have been applied rigorously to the pandemic plans of the Singapore Ministry of Health. orange alert has a better cost-effectiveness ratio than yellow alert. the cost-effectiveness ratio increases exponentially after that due to the much higher costs incurred. if direct and indirect costs were included in the modeling, the incremental cost/death ratio of moving from Yellow Alert to orange increased to $8\u2013$81 million for both hospitals. the cost-effectiveness ratio of higher alert status will decrease. the actual magnitude of the cost-effectiveness will vary depending on institutional cost. indirect costs of an uncontrolled pandemic are also economic and social, especially in Singapore where the economy is dependent on trade and tourism. a step-up approach from green to yellow in accordance with predicted risks may be the most cost-effective approach. it is not known for certain how pandemic 2009 will behave in subsequent waves. a step-up approach from green to yellow may be the most cost-effective approach. Singapore, Hong Kong, and china were among the settings most severely affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. virulence or case-fatality rate of a respiratory viral infection has a serious impact on the hospital infection control response."}
