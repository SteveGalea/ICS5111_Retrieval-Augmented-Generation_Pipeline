{"summary": "re-emerging and newly emerging wildlife-associated zoonoses have led to substantial economic and human losses. such cases represent an important opportunity for early intervention but often proceed undetected due to a range of poorly defined clinical and social factors. the recent west africa Ebola epidemic exemplifies this. elucidate some of the socio-medical mechanisms that have an impact on facility-based surveillance in an under-resourced rural setting. we explore clinical diagnostic processes and their implications for the unseen emergence of novel pathogens. if diseases are not diagnosed, they will remain neglected. 24 of the 76 enrolled participants developed fevers of unknown origin. the criterion for inclusion as a case study was a self-reported fever of unknown origin occurring within the previous 24 h. eight participants had illness episodes that were categorized as \u2018severe\u2019 or \u2018enduring\u2019, meaning they were perceived to be life-threatening or else failed to resolve within 10 days of informal treatment. three participants from village households attended the town's nurse-run clinic prior to presenting at a hospital. participants coming from village households tended to shun the clinic, claiming it was too costly relative to the effectiveness of the treatments available there. the first step in performing a differential diagnosis involves the physician gathering the relevant information about the patient and their condition. this often involves the taking of a medical history and sometimes a physical examination of the patient. this step was limited to a nurse measuring the patient's temperature, weight and blood pressure and the doctor prompting the patient for a list of their current symptoms. the practice of presumptive treatment of fever cases for malaria can be linked to a now superseded set of WHO 2010 guidelines on the treatment of malaria in children. a growing body of research suggests that it is still commonplace in clinical settings across much of Africa. villagers from the town experienced fewer financial restrictions than the villagers. they were able to pursue hospital treatment across lengthy courses of illness. they typically only ceased hospital care when failure to resolve the illness led them to doubt the efficacy of the biomedical approach. multiple disease labels were generated across multiple hospital attendances. in the course of a single episode of illness, multiple disease labels were generated across multiple hospital attendances. such a process distorts doctors' perceptions of local epidemiology by skewing disease surveillance data towards already common conditions. a more suitable alternative to facility-based surveillance could be the establishment of specialized national diagnostic laboratories that are able to receive and test samples without the patient or local health clinic incurring additional costs. some novel zoonoses have been found to cause only a single case or a small number of cases before apparently disappearing from the population entirely. the one health approach to EIDs in west africa is predicated on characterization of accurately diagnosed disease burdens. we must attend, therefore, to the inefficiencies in our dominant approaches to EID surveillance in West Africa. ethics This work was conducted with approval of the noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research Institutional Review Board. a.A.C. is supported by a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award."}
