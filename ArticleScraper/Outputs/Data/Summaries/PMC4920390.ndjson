{"summary": "the virus was first identified during an outbreak of diarrhea on a Belgian swine breeding farm in 1978 [2] Upon infection with PEDV, suckling pigs experience diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality. in the united states, the virus was first detected in April 2013 and has since caused high piglet mortality in over 17 states. RNA virus is readily inactivated in pasteurization processes after only 1 min at 71\u00b0C. high temperatures used in processing rendered products and cereal grains may also be effective in inactivating PEDV in contaminated feed. no research has been conducted to compare PEDV survival at temperatures greater than 80\u00b0C. both vero-76 and vero-81 cells are susceptible to PEDV. we chose to use vero-81 in this study. the cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. the virus was harvested by subjecting the infected cells to three freeze-thaw cycles (-80\u00b0C/25\u00b0C) the supernatant was collected and aliquoted into 50 mL tubes. in all experiments, the surviving virus after a certain treatment was recovered in an eluent consisting of a 3% solution of beef extract solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.5. feed aliquots were prepared in glass beakers, which were then placed into drying ovens set at 120, 130, 140, and 145\u00b0C. after mixing, the beakers were immediately removed and spiked with 1 mL of PEDV (6.8x103 TCID50/mL) that was previously tempered at room temperature (25\u00b0C) Aliquots of complete phase II pig starter feed (5 g amounts) were prepared in several 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes followed by the addition of 1 mL of PEDV to each tube. after mixing, the virus-spiked feed was placed into individual plastic bags. the bags were flattened to remove all of the air and create a thin layer of the feed sample. 0.015 g Ultracid P (Nutriad, Dendermonde, Belgium), 0.02 g of Acid Booster (Agri-Nutrition, DeForest, WI), 0.01 g KEM-GEST (Kemin Agrifoods, Des Moines, IA), 0.02 g of granulated sugar (Shoppers Value, Eden Prairie, MN) and 0.02 g of commercial salt (Essential Everyday, Eden Prairie, MN) inactivation kinetic data (log TCID50/mL) were analyzed by GInaFiT. the traditional log-linear model assumed a linear relationship between the virus concentration and processing time was developed by Bigelow and Esty. if n > 1, the curve is convex (it forms shoulders), if n 1, the curve is concave (it forms tails), and if n = 1, the curve is a straight line and can be described by a linear model. two valid replicates were used to evaluate how well the model fit with the experimental data. cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) after virus inoculation, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the cells were washed again 60 minutes after inoculation. the eluate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 x g to remove organic matter/debris. the supernatants were used to determine the amount of surviving virus, if any. inoculated cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for up to seven days until the CPE appeared. the samples were removed from the oven, actively cooled with a fan for 15 min. the virus eluted from the feed using the 3% beef extract eluent solution. the experiments were performed in duplicate. the sealed bags were shipped via overnight shipping to the national center for electron beam research at the eBeam irradiation facility. preliminary dose delivery trials were performed to determine the appropriate conveyor speed and other specifications to achieve the target doses. mL of PEDV was added to each vial followed by vortexing. the surviving virus was eluted from the samples using the 3% beef extract eluent solution. each experiment used a set of triplicate samples that were combined and used for a single titration and inoculation into cells. surviving virus titer after treatment expressed as TCID50/mL. k is the kinetic parameter (min-1 or day-1) and t is the treatment time (min or days) the kinetic parameter k is usually expressed as D, also known as the decimal reduction time. r e s s i o n S Q t o t a l m j (4) where m is the number of observations, j is the number of model parameters, and SSQ is the sum of squares. an ANOVA test using the mixed procedure of SAS (SAS Inst., Cary, NC) was used to determine statistical differences across treatments. weibull model Log Linear model Temp Delta1 (min) Shape Parameter2 (n) Adj.

PEDV is stable at a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 at a temperature of 37\u00b0C. a change in pH outside of ideal conditions could cause an increase in virus inactivation. the pH of the diet was decreased from an average pH of 5.96 to 4.71. many of the less effective additives contained citric acid and lactic acid as active ingredients. the active ingredient of Activate DA, the most effective additive in our study, is 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid. this ingredient has been researched exclusively for low methionine diets for swine. this experiment also had the limitation of low starting virus titers. this made it impossible to reach the standard of complete inactivation. this made it impossible to reach the standard of complete inactivation. the survivability of PEDV can be reduced by the use of selected acidifiers and organic acids in swine feeds."}
