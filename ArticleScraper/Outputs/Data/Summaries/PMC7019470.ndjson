{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus from the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. it is an enveloped virus with a capsid 50 nm in diameter and an RNA genome of approximately 11 Kb in length. the genome is translated as a single long open reading frame (ORF) the Brazilian epidemic raised great international concern because of severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in neonates born to mothers infected by ZIKV during pregnancy. other routes of ZIKV transmission have been identified, including blood transfusions, transplacental, perinatal, and sexual intercourse. RT-qPCR provides high-quality results, but requires extensive sample preparation, RNA extraction, and technical expertise to run and interpret the amplification of the viral RNA. RT-qPCR provides high-quality results, but available serological methods are prone to produce false-positive results due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses in circulation, such as DENV. reverse transcription reaction LAMP (RT-LAMP) includes enzymes that first convert RNA DNA upstream of the LAMP process, unless a LAMP enzyme with both reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase is used. a set of four or six different primers bind to complementary sequences on the molecular target (Figure 1) [34]. the addition of loop primers (LF and LB) can accelerate the process for exponential amplification of the target sequence. the outer primers (F3 or B3) then hybridizes to region F3c or B3c within the target region. this results in the formation of a dumbbell-shaped DNA, and the same dumbbell structure becomes a seed for exponential amplification. urine, urine, and serum experimentally infected with ZIKV NS5 1 aM No No [39] One-step RT-LAMP Detection: through the colorimetric technology Clinical samples including urine and human serum Puerto Rico (PRVABC 59) Envelope Protein 1.2 RNA copies/L Yes Yes [59] One-step RT-LAMP Detection: monitoring of fluorescence coupled to RT-qPCR. human blood spiked with ZIKV PRABC59, 976 Uganda, NS1 1.56 PFU/mL Yes No [60] Development of a Trioplex assay to detect ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV Detection: development of RT-LAMP protocol coupled with a smartphone.

Bst 2.0 is an in vitro derivative of Bacillus stearothermophilus Bst DNA polymerase. the enzyme has been successfully used for rapid ZIKV detection. it lacks both 5\u2032-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity. two-step protocol to detect ZIKV is less practical than a one-step LAMP. the two-step method is more expensive, requires longer times. these aspects limit the practical use of two-step LAMP for POC applications. the design of ZIKV primers begins with performing multiple alignments of ZIKV and other arbovirus sequences to identify unique and conserved regions within the ZIKV genome. the design of LAMP primers can be carried out using online software such as PrimerExplorer (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/) Kaarj et al. (2018) optimized an RT-LAMP assay with a paper microfluidic chip and smartphone to detect ZIKV in only 15 min. they found that no amplification occurred at 70 \u00b0C, while non-specific amplification in non-template control (NTC) occurred at the sub-optimal temperature of 65 \u00b0C, which is known to allow off-target amplification. calcein and SYBR green I dyes are some of the most widely used for the detection of LAMP amplicons. the dye binds becoming fluorescent and creating an optical readout of LAMP-mediated detection. calcein has also been used to visualize LAMP products in assays for the detection of ZIKV. agarose gel electrophoresis is a popular method of detection for LAMP-based ZIKV assays. turbidity-based LAMP was used to detect the presence of ZIKV in serum samples. a brief centrifugation of the LAMP reaction can be used to pellet the white precipitation. a similar RT-LAMP assay paired a microfluidic chip with smartphone-enabled measurement to simultaneously detect ZIKV, CHIKV, and CHIKV from whole blood samples. some studies reported the use of ZIKV probes in the LAMP reaction, which limits the application in low-resource countries due to the high cost and the need for expensive equipment for data acquisition and analysis. RT-LAMP assay was specific and provided an impressive 1 copy/L limit of detection. system was configured as a bench-top isothermal amplification device. AC susceptometry has also been used as a LAMP readout. the RT-LAMP assay combined with a microfluidic cassette could detect as few as 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the ZIKV in as little as 40 min [37]. the RT-LAMP assay can be performed using either a one-step or two-step protocol directly from sample matrices. of Bst 2.0 polymerase, Bst 3.0 polymerase or OmniAmp polymerase enables the test to be performed in a one-step protocol. these enzymes have both reverse transcriptase (RT) and DNA polymerase activities at a fixed temperature (50\u201372 \u00b0C), so can be run isothermally for the direct detection of RNA or DNA targets. 0 exhibits DNA polymerase activity 5\u2032-3\u2032 with either DNA or RNA targets, strong strand displacement activity, improved RT activity compared to Bst DNA polymerase 2.0. the two-step protocol needs the addition of a reverse transcriptase enzyme together with the DNA polymerase. the two-step method is more expensive, requires longer times, including additional samples and reagents handling steps. RT-LAMP assay using proteinase K treatment had similar sensitivity compared to RNA extracted using a commercial kit (QIAmp viral RNA mini kit) they showed that the RT-LAMP assay had similar sensitivity compared to RNA extracted using the commercial kit. a new RT-LAMP diagnostic assay is designed to target genes encoding NS1, NS2A, NS4A, NS5, the capsid and envelope proteins of the ZIKV genome. it is important to optimize the protocol and include the proper controls to limit the risk of false positives or non-target amplification [40,42,44,64]. s et al. developed a simple system based on an RT-LAMP assay using Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 without RNA extraction or sample pre-treatment. they found that 10-min incubations were sufficient to detect ZIKV from serum samples. 20-min incubations resulted in false-positive amplifications in non-template control (NTC) using water [64]. calcein has also been used to visualize LAMP products in assays for the detection of ZIKV. calcein dye is a metal ion binding fluorophore, which can be added prior to incubation. the positive generation of LAMP products leads to a change in color from orange to green. turbidity offers an alternative approach to tracking LAMP-based detection. using a turbidimeter or absorbance-based (650 nm) plate reader, the optical density of LAMP reactions can be monitored for a white precipitation. this is caused by the generation of magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg2P2O7 (product generated during LAMP) a similar RT-LAMP assay paired a microfluidic chip with smartphone-based measurement to simultaneously detect ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV in blood, urine, and saliva. the system contains streptavidin-magnetic nanoparticles premixed with LAMP reagents, including the analyte and biotinylated primer. the authors evaluated the analytical sensitivity and showed that LAMP was able to recognize 1 attomolar (aM: 1018 moles per liter) synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotide in 20% serum within 27 min. also reported no cross-reactivity with other viruses, including four types of synthetic NS5 genes. the RT-LAMP assay provides a powerful strategy for the development of POC tools for the rapid diagnosis of ZIKV. an analytical specificity refers to the ability of an assay to unequivocally detect the target pathogen in a sample while remaining negative in the presence of relevant, non-target pathogens. no detectable cross-reaction was seen against dengue virus (DENV 1-4), chikungunya virus (YFV), west Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis (SLEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Bussuquara virus (BSQV), Langat virus (LGTV), Powassan virus (POWV), Ilheus virus (ILHV), Pla Kaarj et al. 2018 developed a wax-printed paper microfluidic chip utilizing RT-LAMP. they used a previously published primer set and observed temperature was the most important factor for a specific and efficient RT-LAMP reaction. a total of 81 diagnostic specimens (serum and plasma) collected from patients in Nicaragua and Brazil was assayed by LAMP. RT-LAMP is very specific for ZIKV detection [53]. results demonstrate the high specificity of the RT-LAMP assay. the limit of detection is the lowest amount of the analyte that can reliably be detected in a sample. some studies have found LAMP to have lower or similar sensitivity for the ZIKV when compared to RT-qPCR [28,39], others have found LAMP to out-perform RT-qPCR sensitivity. the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect ZIKV RNA in serum and urine. sensitivity, including differences in enzymes and research suppliers, primers, detection systems, and type of biological samples. sensitivity, including differences in enzymes and research suppliers, primers, detection systems, and type of biological samples. the positive and negative predictive values were calculated based on pre-test probability resulting in approximately 30% for both predictive values [59]. an RT-LAMP assay was able to detect the ZIKV in 53.4% of the total number of samples. this study showed that a faster time to positivity compared to urine samples. the authors demonstrated that ZIKV RNA can be detected by the LAMP test using infected mosquito cell lines and infected mosquitoes. results were visualized by turbidity after 1 h of incubation of the sample in a simple heat block. multiplexing molecular viruses such as ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV have rapidly spread across the world. in these settings, multiplexed detection of the circulating arboviruses is highly desirable. in the last few years, several platforms based on LAMP have been developed for the simultaneous detection of the target viruses. the LAMP for ZIKV has the potential to provide diagnostic performance equal to, or even superior to, RT-qPCR. this type of POC tool can bring decentralization of health care through diagnosis and also have great potential for producing reliable and fast results."}
