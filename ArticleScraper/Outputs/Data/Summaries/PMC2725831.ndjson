{"summary": "wildlife tourism is among the top exporting activities of Tanzania and Kenya. the total expenditure for wildlife-related activities was $101 billion in 1996, 1.4% of the national economy (6). only 20 human cases of rabies were transmitted by dogs in all Latin America (9). the disease occurs in evergreen rain forests interspersed with deciduous patches and clearings for rice cultivation and human habitations. emergence of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in east-central argentina during the 1950s. rabies epidemic occurred in free-ranging greater kudus (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) in Namibia (15) the outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia in 1998\u20131999 caused 265 human cases of viral encephalitis and a 38% mortality rate. pig farming led to reemergence of zoonoses such as bovine tuberculosis in captive deer populations. deer at low population densities on natural range are less likely to be affected by disease. translocation of wild animals is associated with the spread of several zoonoses. raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are becoming a new reservoir for rabies. in eastern Europe, raccoon dogs are becoming a new reservoir for rabies. the simian foamy virus has been identified as a zoonotic retrovirus that infects people who have direct contact with fresh nonhuman primate bushmeat. new retroviruses, human T-lymphotropic virus types 3 and 4 were found in persons who hunt, butcher or keep monkeys or apes as pets in southern Cameroon. the avian influenza epidemic is directly related to infected birds sold live in traditional markets. the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus was linked to trade of live, wild carnivores, especially civets, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (2). more cases of imported rickettsioses likely to occur in Europe, North America, and elsewhere in years to come. zoonotic infection with herpes B virus in humans usually results in fatal encephalomyelitis or severe neurologic impairment. more than 25 outbreaks of human infectious diseases associated with visitors to animal exhibits were identified during 1990\u20132000. 12 circus elephant handlers at an exotic animal farm in Illinois were infected with M. tuberculosis. 1 had signs consistent with active disease after 3 elephants died of tuberculosis. iguanas have a stable mixture of salmonella serotypes in their intestinal tract. most iguanas have a stable mixture of salmonella serotypes in their intestinal tract. most iguanas have a stable mixture of salmonella serotypes in their intestinal tract. conservation of habitat biodiversity is critical for preventing emergence of new reservoirs or amplifier species. key measures for reducing dispersion of emerging zoonoses include sustainable agricultural development, proper education of tourists about the risks of outdoor activities."}
