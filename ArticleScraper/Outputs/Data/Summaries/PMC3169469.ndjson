{"summary": "Background Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of chronic liver diseases. the treatment with interferon plus ribavirin has limited benefits due to adverse side effects such as anemia, depression, fatigue, and \"flu-like\" symptoms. ally infected by HCV, which is the main cause of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). current treatment of standard for HCV comprises a combination of high-dose pegylated interferon alpha (IFN-) with the guanosine analogue ribavirin (Rib) about 75% of patients receive no therapeutic benefit from the current combination therapy. Glycyrrhiza glabra is a perennial herb, native to central and South-Western Asia, as well as to the Mediterranean region. it has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. it has been shown that GL inhibited the inflammation in mice model of liver injury. cell line The Huh-7 cell line was offered by Dr. Zafar Nawaz. cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum. anti-HCV analysis of Glycyrrhizin on Huh-7 cell line was used to establish in-vitro replication of HCV. a similar protocol was used for viral inoculation as established by Zekari et al. 2009. formula was used to calculate the concentration HCV RNA of each sample. IC = internal control, which is specific for each lot. agarose gels were lysed with ProteoJET mammalian cell lysis reagent. blots were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies specific to HCV Core and GAPDH. 100 g/ml streptomycin, at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 100-200 ng extracted viral RNA was isolated from 100 l serum aliquots. pCR3.1 mammalian expression plasmid was amplified and cloned. 108 IU/ml from HCV-3a patient's was used as principle inoculum. cells were kept in 6-well plates to semi-confluence, washed twice with serum-free medium, then inoculated with 500 l and 500 l serum free media. cells were harvested and assessed for viral RNA quantification by real time PCR. cells were transfected with expression plasmids containing HCV 3a core gene (0.4 g) in the presence and absence of GL by using LipofectamineTM 2000. cDNA was synthesized with 1 g of RNA, using Revert Aid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. equal amounts of total protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane following the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad, CA). after blocking non-specific binding sites with 5% skimmed milk, blots were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies specific to HCV Core and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) ed with haemocytometer and trypan blue dye explosive method. cells were plated at the density of 3 105 cells in six well plates. after 24 h, cells were infected with 2 105 copies of 3a genotype. DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and pre-incubated for 24 h. cells were then treated with 10 IU IFN-alpha 2b for 6 h. the effect of the compound was tested with or without interferon. GL showed 55% reduction in viral titer alone. GL inhibits HCV RNA and protein expression significantly in a dose-dependent manner, while GAPDH mRNA and protein expression remains unaffected by the addition of the GL. after 24 h incubation period, total RNA was extracted and the levels of HCV core gene were determined. after 24 h incubation period cells were trypsinized and counted with haemocytometer and trypan blue dye explosive method. cells were plated at the density of 3 105 cells in six well plates. after 24 h, cells were infected with 2 105 HCV virus copies of 3a genotype. cells were seeded at 2 104 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM medium. cells were then treated with 10 IU IFN-alpha 2b for 6 h. the effect of the compound was tested with or without interferon. cDNA were generated by oligo dT primers specific to the HCV core gene of 3a genotype. GL inhibits HCV RNA and protein expression significantly in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA and protein expression remains unaffected by the addition of the GL. GL (licorice root extract) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. GL inhibits CD4+ T-cell and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytotoxicity. GL has a membrane stabilizing effect [17] and stimulates endogenous production of interferon [18]. GL was checked for toxicological analysis in both Huh-7 and CHO cell lines. our data shows that GL is non toxic at concentrations up to 100 g. the data was further verified by microscopic examination of cells. GL inhibits HCV core gene expression or function in a dose-dependent manner similar to interferon alpha 2a. GL may show antiviral effect due to its ability to reduce membrane fluidity [37] and up regulation of Cox2 or related pathway."}
