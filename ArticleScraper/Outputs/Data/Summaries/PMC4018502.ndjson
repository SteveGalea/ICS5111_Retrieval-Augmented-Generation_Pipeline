{"summary": "anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp) antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human FcRII family. only FcRII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection. results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE. emergence of novel coronavirus responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), [4,5] and the new H7N9 strain of avian influenza that has jumped into humans [6,7] underscore a vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers triggered infection of human B cell lines. anti-Spike antibody potentiates infection of both monocytic and lymphoid immune cells, thus providing evidence for a novel and versatile mechanism by which SARS-CoV can enter into target cells. ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection in different circulating immune cell types, among which the monocytic lineage anti-spike serum promotes internalization of SARS-CoV by human macrophages. findings conclude that anti-spike serum promotes internalization of SARS-CoV by human macrophages. a human monocytic cell line THP-1 was susceptible to ADE of infection. a 4-fold increase in the percentage of positive cells was noted in the presence of anti-Spike serum for two out of three donors. compared to inoculums containing control serum, there was a 2 to 3-fold increase in the detection of both positive and negative strands of viral genes in macrophages infected in presence of anti-Spike serum. images are representatives of five independent experiments using macrophages from five donors. infection was quantified by counting the percentage of immunofluorescence-positive cells in randomly chosen fields using Metamorph software. ocapsid and ORF1b gene expression in infected human macrophages. RNA levels were higher in infected cells in presence of anti-Spike. ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection is dependent on the dose of IgG fraction of heat-inactivated immune-serum. the flow-through (FT) from the same serum elicited no detectable infection at all concentrations. significant differences between ADE of infection with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG and flow-through were observed at concentrations 10 and 2.5 g/mL. marginal difference was observed at 0.625 g/mL. to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism we have investigated the involvement of different domains of FcRII in mediating ADE. to this end we produced a series of truncated constructs that only carried ectodomain and transmembrane domains of FcRII. we then verified the expression of these constructs on ST486 cells by flow cytometry using a specific monoclonal antibody (clone FLI8.26) all four transfectants expressing wild-type FcRII forms were infected. all the endodomain-truncated constructs (FcRIIA-H.IC, FcRIIA-R.IC and FcRIIB.IC, corresponding to constructs 1, 5, 9, 10 respectively) were not susceptible to ADE of infection. SARS-CoVpp were incubated with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG (dark grey) or control IgG (light grey) to form immune complexes. mutated constructs were used to produce stably transduced ST486 cell lines. cells were washed and three days later. post infection incubation was stopped by adding luciferase substrate to measure enzymatic activity. results are shown as means SEM of three (B and C) or 4\u20135 independent experiments (D). primary human macrophages are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection through antibody-mediated pathway. positive immunofluorescence signals were detected only at 6 h.p.i. when SARS-CoV was opsonized with both control and anti-Spike serum (Figure 2). whereas presence of control serum led to only modest infection by SARS-CoV (5% of cells), a 4-fold increase in the percentage of positive cells was noted in the presence of anti-Spike serum for two out of three donors. monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with SARS-CoV (strain HK39849) at an MOI of 1 in the presence of a 1:1000 dilution of either anti-Spike or control serum. cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue) anti-Spike serum increased infectivity of SARS-CoV by 3-4-fold in macrophages of two out of three donors. the ordinate\u2019s scale for Donor 3 is different for ease of visualization. purified IgG from mouse anti-Spike serum triggered infection in Raji cells. the flow-through (FT) from the same serum elicited no detectable infection at all concentrations. significant differences between ADE of infection with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG and flow-through were observed at concentrations 10 and 2.5 g/mL. results are shown as means SEM of 6 measurements from two independent experiments. to gain further insight into the underlying molecular mechanism we have investigated the involvement of different domains of FcRII in mediating ADE of SARS-CoV. all four transfectants expressing wild-type FcRII forms were infected. all the endodomain-truncated constructs (FcRIIA-H.IC, FcRIIA-R.IC and FcRIIB.IC, respectively) were not susceptible to ADE of infection. however, not all chimeric constructs were able to sustain ADE of infection. FcRIIB.EC/IIA.IC (viz., construct 12) showed robust ADE despite one of the lowest binding ability of immune-complexes. susceptibility to ADE is dependent on an intact cytosolic domain. SARS-CoVpp were incubated with purified mouse anti-Spike IgG (dark grey) or control IgG (light grey) and then used to infect cells. cells were washed and three days post infection incubation was stopped by adding luciferase substrate. results are shown as means SEM of three (B and C) or 4\u20135 independent experiments (D) fected by SARS-CoV in the absence of immune-serum (MOI = 1\u20132), we observed a much lower infection rate (about 5-7%). this may be due to difference of time of sampling (6 hours in our study versus 15 hours in Cheung\u2019s study) and the protocol used for in vitro differentiation. focusing on either identifying the (immune) receptor(s) and/or serum component(s) allowing penetration of the pathogen into the target cell, also known as extrinsic ADE, or intrinsic ADE [20,21,28]. only FcRIIA and, to a lesser extent, FcRIIB1 triggered infection by SARS-CoVpp in presence of anti-Spike serum [16]. binding of SARS-CoVpp to cells via the extracellular domain of FcRs is not sufficient to trigger ADE of infection as entry requires an intact intracellular domain. the results obtained with chimeric constructions where the whole intracellular domain of FcRIIA and FcRIIB were swapped lend further support. no discernible effect on dengue virus immune complex infectivity was observed for both wild type and signaling incompetent FcRIIA. findings suggest different mechanisms of dengue virus immune complex internalization may operate between these FcRs.
