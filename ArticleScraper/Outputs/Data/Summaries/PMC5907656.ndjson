{"summary": "fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane is mediated by the viral fusion protein. the trimeric fusion protein undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement from its metastable prefusion conformation to the postfusion conformation after triggering an event like receptor binding or a pH change. the fusion protein transmembrane domain (TMD) has been implicated in protein stability and function. fusion proteins from different viral families were analyzed for oligomerization. chimeric proteins containing the TMD of interest fused with the protein staphylococcal nuclease (SN) were analyzed for oligomerization. the addition of SN aids in purification and increases the extinction coefficient, which aids data collection in absorbance-based assays. the resulting spectra represent an equilibrium in which higher-molecular-weight species have a higher absorbance. single-species analysis of each construct at pH 7 or 5 indicated a predicated molecular weight (N) that was greater than the molecular weight of the monomeric species. the SN-TM proteins are of a higher oligomeric state or that multiple oligomeric species are present. analysis is shown for the monomer-trimer (1:3) (blue) and monomer-trimer-hexamer (1:3:6) (red) curve fits. best fit changed from pH 7 to 5 for influenza virus HA. rabies virus GP was found to require exposure to pH below 6.2 to drive membrane fusion. influenza virus HA triggers in acidic environment of an endosome. evidence suggests this may be important for cathepsin cleavage activity. the Nipah virus F prefusion crystal structure revealed that six F trimers interacted in a ring structure that may contribute to prefusion protein stability. the close proximity of the fusion proteins in this tertiary structure could provide a platform for the interaction between trimeric TMDs. 1:3 and 1:3:6 fits are shown, with the monomeric curve fits shown in black. the monomeric curve fits are shown in black, with the monomeric curve fits shown in black."}
