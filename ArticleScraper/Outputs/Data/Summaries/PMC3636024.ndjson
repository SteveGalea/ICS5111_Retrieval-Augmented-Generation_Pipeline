{"summary": "virucidal activity of airborne disinfectants on poliovirus type 1 has not been studied. poliovirus inoculum was laid on a stainless carrier. the products were spread into the room by hot fogging for 30 minutes. the bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal activities of aerial surface disinfection can be tested thanks to described procedures. non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to disinfection and drying than enveloped viruses. the resistance of viruses to biocides depends on their size, structure and on their presence of a viral envelope. a cytopathic effect of at least 90% appeared, the cells were scratched off. the cell suspension was frozen (80\u00b0C) and thawed three times. the resulting supernatant was stored at 80\u00b0C for 10 minutes. the inocula were recovered from discs thanks to wet flocked swabs (COPAN) the swabs were vortexed for 15 seconds in 1 mL of culture medium. gel fitration Gel filtration was used in order to eliminate the cytotoxicity of fluids containing disinfectant. tamine at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. a cytopathic effect of at least 90% appeared, the cells were scratched off and the suspension was thawed three times. the resulting supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. the inocula were recovered from discs thanks to wet flocked swabs. the swabs were vortexed for 15 seconds in 1 mL of culture medium. gel fitration Gel filtration was used in order to eliminate the cytotoxicity of fluids containing disinfectant. an inoculum of 50 L of culture supernatant fluid containing poliovirus was applied on stainless carriers in duplicate. it was dried and thereafter recovered by using wet flocked swabs at 0, 90 or 150 min. the infectious titers were determined and expressed as Log10 TCID50.mL-1. the disinfectant products were diffused in the room during 30 minutes. after 60 and 120 min, the carrier surface was scrubbed with a wet flocked swab to recover the iconulum that was then resuspended in culture medium (1 mL) the medium was filtrated through a column to eliminate the cytotoxic disinfectant products. the medium was filtrated through a column to eliminate the cytotoxic disinfectant products. titrations performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. the infectious titer of inoculum before drying was 106 TCID50.mL-1. after drying, it was 105.1 TCID50.mL-1 and was roughly maintained at this level up to 150 minutes after drying (104.6 TCID50.mL-1). 50 L of culture supernatant fluids containing poliovirus supplemented with 5% milk were applied on stainless carriers in duplicate. they were dried and then exposed to airborne disinfectant products containing peracetic acid 1260 ppm (ASEPTANIOS AD) and 2500 ppm (ASEPTANIOS OXY+) or not exposed. the disinfectant products were diffused in the room during 30 minutes. airborne disinfection is an efficient disinfecting method for various surfaces to inactivate bacteria, fungi and spores. however, the efficiency of airborne disinfection against viruses was not extensively reported. we decided to take advantage of procedures described in a norm [3] recommended for testing airborne disinfection against microbes to evaluate the virucidal effect of disinfectants diffused by hot fogging. stainless steel discs were relevant to test the effectiveness of disinfectants on surfaces. they do not bind, absorb or sequester viruses and are small enough to be easily handled. the elimination of disinfectants from the recovered samples is critical before testing the level of infectious viral particles in recovered samples. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contribution TT and P-EL carried out the experiments together. DH designed and managed the study and participated in the analysis of data and the preparation of the manuscript."}
