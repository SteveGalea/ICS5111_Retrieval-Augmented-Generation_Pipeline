{"summary": "sequence complementarities and three-nucleotide based genetic codes in messenger RNA (mRNA) imbue interesting features for translation. these include a) an intra-molecular duplex (formed via sequence complementarities) having to be unwound for decoding, and b) one of three potential reading-frames having to be maintained for faithful protein synthesis. an optimally placed internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in prokaryotic mRNA may serve as a 1 PRF stimulator by pairing with the anti-SD element in 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 70S ribosome. previously, we identified a 170-nucleotide RNA element (ATT) capable of down-regulating viral1 PRF [14], [13]. nces effect is not the main cause of attenuation. we further demonstrate that this minimal element acted through a hairpin form with attenuation efficiency determined by hairpin stability and spacing to the slippery site. this potential hairpin also enhanced +1 frameshifting in yeast. in vitro 1 PRF assays by SDS-PAGE analysis of 35S methionine-labeled translation products for reporter constructs containing different 5\u2032 deletions of the ATT element. the two major bands in each lane correspond to 0 (lower) and 1 (higher) frame translation products. value for each construct is presented as meanSD (error bars) of triplicate experiments. the refolding pathway of unwound RNA structures within the 70S ribosome cores has not been comprehensively investigated. the crystal structure of an elongation mode indicates that nucleotides within the first codon upstream of the E codon are flexible. we disrupted two potential AU base pairs in the lower stem of the predicted hairpin. the predicted secondary structure of the attenuation hairpin stem is crucial for its 1 PRF attenuation activity. the covered viral sequences (13318 to 13391) and the predicted secondary structure are shown, with the six swapped base pairs boxed for comparison. the slippery site is underlined and followed by a SARS-PK stimulator. in vitro attenuation activity of the 6BPGC hairpin is not sensitive to base-pair formation involving 3\u2032- flanking CG. disrupting potential base pairs at 3\u2032- flanking CG impaired attenuation activity by a third. however, only one potential GC base pair exists in the region of wild-type SARS-CoV viral RNA sequences. the apical UGCG loop and G bulge are not major determinants of attenuation. deletion of 6 nucleotides at the 5\u2032-half of the lower stem abolished attenuation activity. the attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is positively correlated with its stability. a linear regression line is shown with the equation for the line and the regression statistic, R2, and a threshold stability below which the hairpin does not attenuate frameshifting. we investigated the role of stability in the potency of attenuator hairpins by designing a simplified RNA hairpin with only 6 GC base pairs. attenuation activity of a hairpin depends on its spacing to the slippery site. attenuation functions are preserved among distinct eukaryotic systems. attenuators down-regulate distinct 1 PRF stimulators. frameshifting efficiency of the construct containing the DU177 pseudoknot alone was treated as 100% (for comparison purposes) frameshifting efficiency of the construct containing the DU177 pseudoknot alone was treated as 100% (for comparison purposes) a potent 6BPGC hairpin attenuated a weaker SARS 1 PRF stimulator so efficiently that the resultant intensity of radioactivity in in vitro assays gave uncertain results. concording with flanking sequences effects, changing sequences in the 1 frame E site led to variations in 1 frameshifting efficiencies. these were promoted by the same stimulator regardless of the absence or presence of an M1 attenuator. the 0 frame and 1 frame products are designated by filled circles and triangles, respectively. no obvious variation in attenuation activity was observed in 1 PRF reporters (with or without the in-cis attenuator hairpin) this suggests that 1 PRF attenuation is not mediated by either mechanism. an upstream 6BPGC hairpin with 5\u2032-flanking sequences designed to prevent direct E site invasion stimulated +1 frameshifting of the CGG-containing shift site. this upstream 6BPGC hairpin serves as a +1 PRF stimulator when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast. viral sequences, covering nucleotides 13363 to 13387, possessed substantial1 PRF attenuation activity. the base of the predicted hairpin stem is only 4 nucleotides away from the 5\u2032-edge of the slippery site. two nucleotides, 27 nucleotides upstream of the 0-frame E site and those involved in terminal stem base-pairing formation, are colored for comparison. value for each construct was the mean of three independent experiments. similar results were observed for GC-SB-WT and 6BPGC hairpins. together, these results suggest that base-pair formation and the composition of the predicted hairpin stem are crucial for efficient attenuation. chimera attenuation activity was further enhanced in vitro and in 293T cell cultures. 13318-WT and 13318-6BPGC constructs harboring transiently expressed 13318-WT and 13318-6BPGC constructs. the frameshifting efficiency of 13318-WT was treated as 100%. potential to form four extra base pairs between 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- flanking sequences of the 6BPGC hairpin stem. selected 6BPGC 5\u2032-flanking sequence mutants were placed upstream of a distinct 1 PRF stimulator, the DU177 pseudoknot [19], and examined for their attenuation activity in 293T cells. the results indicate that the two potential base pairs involving E-site sequences are not the main cause of observed attenuation activity in 293T cells. an upstream C nucleotide was deleted and accompanied with an A to G replacement. the modified sequences in AddLoop and rBulge constructs are typed in blue and red. value for each construct was the mean of three independent experiments. Spacing to the Slippery Site Determines if a Hairpin acts as an Efficient 1 PRF Attenuator. base-pairing disruption at the lower stem leads to changes in the spacing between the bottom of the hairpin stem and the slippery site. inserted sequences were designed to retain no stable secondary structure. the inserted sequences were designed to regenerate the 3\u2032-flanking CGUU sequence. frameshifting efficiency of the construct 13390\u201313520 was treated as 100%. attenuation Activity is not Sensitive to E Site Sequence Variation In contrast, a potential hairpin attenuator upstream of the slippery site possesses an opposing effect. a potent 6BPGC hairpin attenuated a weaker SARS 1 PRF stimulator so efficiently that the resultant intensity of radioactivity in in vitro assays gave uncertain results. sequences of M1 attenuator hairpin with mutation site boxed and 5\u2032WT-M1 element boldly typed. sequence variation (top), SDS PAGE result of 1 PRF assays (middle) and attenuation efficiencies of M1 attenuator (bottom) of reporter constructs with different downstream pseudoknot stimulators. the 6BPGC hairpin stimulates +1 frameshifting in Yeast A hepta-nucleotide sequence (CUUAGGC) it is caused by a ribosomal pause at the AGG codon due to the low expression levels of decoding tRNA in yeast. a partially functional CUUCGGC sequence represented an ideal platform for evaluating the properties of an upstream 6BPGC hairpin. a disrupted attenuator hairpin (5\u2032-WT) was designated by and the 5\u2032-flanking sequence of 6BPGC hairpin was designed to prevent forming base-pairs with E site sequences. mutations that change nucleotide composition in a hairpin stem can alter the encoded amino acids. ribosomal unwound RNA structure in a ribosome is not a major determinant of 1 PRF attenuation. a previous study indicates that a length of about 30 nucleotides is protected from ribonuclease digestion when mRNA is occupied by a prokaryotic ribosome. a refolding hairpin stem proximal to the ribosomal E site during 1 PRF stimulation is shown to exert a 5\u2032-pulling force on RNA-DNA hybrids at the active site of RNA polymerase. the upstream hairpin may serve as a wheel chock that blocks 1. a stable hairpin upstream of the slippery site represents a cis-acting RNA motif for 1 PRF attenuation. this is in contrast to the downstream 1 PRF stimulator. deletion of six nucleotides restored 1 PRF efficiency to that of the ATT-lacking 13390\u201313520 construct in vitro. cis-acting regulators in the programmed reading-frame switches of genomes should benefit from the stability and proximity features revealed in this study. p2luc recoding reporter [29] suitable for both +1 and 1 frameshifting assays was a kind gift from Professor John Atkins. the amplified inserts of interest were then cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of p2luc. the resultant recombinant vectors were transformed into DH5 strain of coli cells for maintenance and selection by ampicillin. all of the base-pairing disruption and restoration mutants were constructed using a quik-change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. y vector has the same set of cloning sites as those in p2Luc. identities of all cloned and mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. y vector has the same set of cloning sites as those in p2Luc. radioactivity-based 1 PRF activity measurement in vitro was performed assuming that the ribosome drop-off effect [29] was minimized for the translation of a shortened 1 frame product. shifted ribosomes would encounter a premature 1 frame stop codon. in frameshifting efficiency between two constructs with or without an upstream hairpin, divided by the frameshifting efficiency value of the construct without the upstream hairpin. experiments were performed in triplicate and reported as one standard deviation from the mean. cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 1 mL of ice cold lysis buffer (1 PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF) and then re-suspended in 0.3 mL of the same buffer. p2luc recoding reporter [29] suitable for both +1 and 1 frameshifting assays. the amplified inserts of interest were then cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of p2luc using standard procedures. the resultant recombinant vectors were transformed into DH5 strain of E. coli cells for maintenance and selection by ampicillin. pJDL-empty vector has the same set of cloning sites as those in p2Luc. Identities of all cloned and mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. samples were then resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and exposed to a phosphorImager screen for quantification on BAS-2500 phosphorImager (Fujifilm) or Typhoon FLA7000 phosphorImager (GE) after drying. shifted ribosomes would encounter a premature 1 frame stop codon. attenuation efficiency of an upstream hairpin was defined as the difference in frameshifting efficiency between two constructs with or without an upstream hairpin. 0.5\u20131105 HEK-293T cells per well were cultured in a 24-well culture plate with 1000 l growth medium. reporter constructs were grown in liquid media composed of a minimal SD base with -Ura Do supplement (Clonetech) to an O.D.595 nm value of 1.0 on a 1 mL scale. cell suspensions were lysed with glass beads by agitation in a vortex mixer at 4\u00b0C for 3 minutes. in vitro -1 PRF assays by SDS-PAGE analysis of 35S methionine-labeled translation products for constructs containing variants of 6GC-hairpin of (A) above. relative frameshifting activity calculated from dual-luciferase assay data obtained from 293T cells harboring transiently expressed p2Luc reporters. reporters contain 6BPGC 5\u2032-flanking sequence mutants with the SARS-PK replaced by DU177 pseudok in vitro -1 PRF assays by SDS-PAGE analysis for attenuator-less reporter in the presence of different amounts of in-trans WT attenuator hairpins. concentrations of the RNA hairpin are labeled as indicated. nucleotide sequences and encoded amino acids of selected upstream -1 PRF attenuator hairpin variants."}
