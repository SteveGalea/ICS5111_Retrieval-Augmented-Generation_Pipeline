{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a widely expressed interferon-stimulated gene that inhibits in vitro replication of pathogenic viruses. the single protein accounts for 50 to 80% of the in vitro antiviral actions of interferon and is also vital in vivo. the source of the IFITM protein is shown by a suffix as follows: H, human; M, mouse. the amino acids are color coded as follows: red, hydrophobic amino acids; green, polar amino acids and basic amino acids. each AS mutant is named for the first of six sequential residues substituted with alanines (red A's) anti-CIL (-CIL) serum was used because it can recognize the 19AS and 25AS mutant proteins. kDa, kilodaltons. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) serves as a loading control throughout. IFITM3 partially colocalizes with the late endosomal and lysosomal host proteins RAB7, CD63, and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1). viruses that are restricted by IFITM3 normally enter cells by emerging from late endosomes and/or lysosomes, with exception of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) chimeric proteins were cloned into pQCXIP or pQCXIH gammaretroviral vector. cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1-3XHA in frame with a glycine-serine flexible linker and three sequential HA nonapeptide epitopes. chimeric proteins were cloned into pQXCIP. human gamma interferon (IFN-) (PBL) was used at 100 to 300 ng/ml. retroviral particles were produced as previously described. whole-cell lysates were prepared using Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. samples were then transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with the indicated antibodies. anti-NTD IFITM3 antisera was probed at a dilution of 1:250. NV stocks were added at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.5 to 1.0. IAV-infected cells were fixed 12 h postinfection. deNV-infected plates were fixed 36 h postinfection. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated wild-type IFITM3 or IFITM3 mutants. cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 2 ml ice-cold lysis buffer. crude cell lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. protein G magnetic bead immune complexes were washed 5 times with 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 100 l of 1 Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. cells were immunoblotted with either anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma) or anti-IFITM3 (Abgent) the co-IPed untagged IFITM3 is indicated in red. the anti-NTD sera also recognizes IFITM2, but not IFITM1. input represents 10% of lysates used for the IP reactions. values are mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments. immunostained for IFITM3 (red) or CD63 (green) and stained for DNA (blue) proteins were then eluted with HA peptides (Sigma) in PBS. the pellet was washed in ice-cold 10% TCA and then washed in ice-cold acetone (Sigma) after air drying, the pellet was subjected to trypsin digestion prior to mass spectroscopy (MS) coverslips were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning inverted confocal microscope with a 63 Zeiss Plan-Apochromat differential interference contrast (DIC) oil lens objective or Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope. image analysis to determine colocalizations was done using ZEN software (Zeiss) or Fiji. human gamma interferon (IFN-) (PBL) was used at 100 to 300 ng/ml. retroviral particles were produced as previously described. anti-NTD IFITM3 antisera (catalog no. AP1153a; Abgent) was probed at a dilution of 1:250. secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (catalog no. 211-062-171; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used at 1:5,000. anti-CIL antibody raised against IFITM1 (catalog no. 5807; ProS IAV-infected cells were immunostained for HA expression using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Wistar Institute) (12) in D-PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) both IAV- and DENV-infected cells were then immunostained with a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-mouse 488) at 1:1,000. FITM2 or IFITM3 plasmid DNA was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 2 ml ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 100. crude cell lysates were scraped off the surface of the flask, transferred to prechilled tubes, and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. the protein G magnetic bead immune complexes were washed 5 times with 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted with either anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma) or anti-IFITM3 (Abgent) the indicated IFITM protein plasmids (HA tagged) were cotransfected into 293T cells along with untagged IFITM3. input represents 10% of lysates used for the IP reactions. HA-tagged IFITM3 and untagged IFITM3 were coexpressed in 293T cells and then IPed using anti-HA antibody. A549 cells stably expressing an IFITM3 with a single HA-tagged IFITM3 (M3-HA) and vector control cells were treated with either buffer or IFN- for 16 h. the cells were washed in cold PBS three times with centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and then lysed in 3 ml MCLB (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% NP-40 the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in D-PBS and incubated sequentially in D-PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 0.1% Tween 20. for -tubulin immunostaining, the cells were fixed in 20\u00b0C methanol for 10 min and then washed with D-PBS. coverslips were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning inverted confocal microscope with a 63 Zeiss Plan-Apochromat differential interference contrast (DIC) oil lens objective or Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope. image analysis to determine colocalizations was done using ZEN software (Zeiss) or Fiji. FITM3 results in a >60% loss of the in vitro protective effects of IFN- spanning the entire viral replication cycle. we hypothesized that specific amino acids within IFITM3 make critical contributions to its antiviral function. the CD225 domain is also largely uncharacterized. therefore, investigating the structural basis of IFITM3's restriction will improve our understanding of a number of related proteins. the 55AS protein was expressed at low levels and so was not further evaluated. the anti-NTD sera recognizes the IFITM3 sequence from amino acids 20 to 32. because their mutations destroyed its epitope, the anti-NTD sera could not detect expression of 19AS and 25AS. the wild-type amino acid sequence (IFITM3) is shown in the top row. a549 cells stably transduced with the empty retroviral vector, IFITM3, or the indicated AS mutant proteins were challenged with WSN/33 and then fixed at 12 h postinfection. values are the mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments. mutant proteins restricted equivalently to wild-type IFITM3 when expressed at comparable levels. a549 cells stably transduced with the empty retroviral vector, wild-type IFITM3, or the indicated mutant proteins were infected with WSN/33 for 12 h. values are the mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments along with standard deviations. IFITM3's NTD and CIL are required for restriction. the cells were challenged side by side with IAV WSN/33 or DENV NGC. the percent infection was determined by IF staining of HA or E protein. the cells were challenged with DENV serotype 2 new Guinea C (NGC) strain. they were then immunostained for DENV E-protein expression as a measure of viral replication. many of the same regions in IFITM3's NTD and CD225 domain that were necessary for IAV inhibition were also needed for DENV restriction. alteration of Y20A resulted in a mislocalization of the mutant protein to smaller clusters throughout the cellular periphery and surface. the relative colocalization of Y20 with LAMP1 was also lower compared to IFITM3, with the normalized values being 1.0 0.1 for IFITM3 versus 0.3 0.1. values are the mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments. cell peripheries are outlined based on DIC images. IM1 comprises the first portion of the CD225 domain. the Y99A mutant protein was expressed to levels similar to those of wild-type IFITM3. two tyrosines, Y20 in the NTD and Y99 in the CIL, each contributed to IFITM3-mediated restriction. mutation of R85 to alanine alone was sufficient to diminish restriction of both IAV and DENV and produce the perinuclear localization seen with 85AS. to assess which individual amino acids in the most C-terminal portion of the CIL were needed for restriction, we substituted either K104 or C105 with alanine. similar to C71, we found that altering C105 to alanine did not affect IFITM3's location or its inhibition of IAV or DENV infection. in conclusion, these experiments identified specific residues within IFITM3's NTD, IM1 within the CD225 domain that were needed for antiviral activity the HA-tagged protein, MDA9, did not interact with IFITM3. amino acids 67 to 85 within IM1 were required for IFITM association. the most critical residues were amino acids 73 to 78. we found an interaction between endogenous IFITM3 and a stably expressed IFITM3 containing a single HA tag. this interaction was enhanced after IFN- treatment was used to increase endogenous IFITM3 levels. IFITM3 is 59% identical to IFITM1, with the major difference residing in IFITM3's NTD. FITM1's amino acids 29 to 245 or IFITM2's amino acids 50 to 118 to generate M3M1 and M3M2. the NTD of IFITM2 was fused to IFITM3, amino acids 51 to 119, to produce M1M3 and M2M3. IFITM1 (M1; green), IFITM2 (M2; blue), and IFITM3 (M3; red) are shown with their respective IM1, CIL, and IM2 domains. the remaining protein regions color coded based on their origin are shown below. a number of putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in IFITM3 including the synonymous rs12252 SNP, which alters a predicted splice acceptor site. rs12252 has variable allele and genotype frequencies in different human populations with the severe influenza-associated alternative C allele being rare in Europeans. s1136853 alternative T allele is rare in all populations. three SNPs, V31M/rs199582787, P70T/rs199749095, and G95R/rs1744108 were not present in the 1000GENOMES data most likely due to their MAFs of 0.2%, 6.4%, and 1.4%, respectively. footnote 1 indicates that the allele frequencies were derived from Agilent whole-exome sequencing of 662 participants of European descent. the polymorphism was identified in the Coriell Apparently Healthy Collection (AGI_ASP_population) a Bold italic font indicates that the major variant is the same in both IFITM2 and IFITM3. however, for 5 SNPs, the amino acids at these positions are identical in IFITM3 and IFITM2 suggesting that these SNPs were accurately called as nonsynonymous in either IFITM3 or IFITM2. a region of IFITM3 whose alteration led to reduced expression or antiviral function (61AS unexpressible) in IM1, a region of IFITM3 whose alteration led to reduced expression or antiviral function (67AS defective in restriction) in contrast, G95R was expressed and localized similarly to both wild-type IFITM3 and P70T. depletion of IFITM3 results in a >60% loss of the in vitro protective effects of IFN- spanning the entire viral replication cycle. we hypothesized that specific amino acids within IFITM3 make critical contributions to its antiviral function. the CD225 domain is also largely uncharacterized. therefore, investigating the structural basis of IFITM3's restriction will improve our understanding of a number of related proteins. TD, amino acids 19 to 29 and amino acids 43 to 55, were both required for inhibition of IAV infection. the 55AS protein was expressed at low levels and so was not further evaluated. the anti-NTD sera recognizes the IFITM3 sequence from amino acids 20 to 32. because their mutations destroyed its epitope, the anti-NTD sera could not detect expression of 19AS and 25AS. the wild-type amino acid sequence (IFITM3) is shown in the top row. a549 cells stably transduced with the empty retroviral vector, IFITM3, or the indicated AS mutant proteins were challenged with WSN/33 and then fixed at 12 h postinfection. values are mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments along with the standard deviation (error bars) 73AS mutants, 80AS and 85AS mutants are 2.5-fold lower than IFITM3. the levels of wild-type IFITM3 restricted equivalently to wild-type IFITM3 when expressed at comparable levels. the cells were challenged side by side with IAV WSN/33 or DENV NGC. the percent infection was determined by IF staining of HA or E protein. both 80AS and 85AS mutant proteins were more centrally located than WT IFITM3, suggesting that these regions influence intracellular distribution. the cells were challenged with DENV serotype 2 new Guinea C (NGC) strain. they were immunostained for DENV E-protein expression as a measure of viral replication. many of the same regions in IFITM3's NTD (amino acids 19 to 30) and CD225 domain (amino acids 67 to 90 and amino acids 103 to 102) were also needed for DENV restriction. Y20A mutant protein migrated slower than IFITM3 and other mutant proteins in immunoblots, suggesting that this mutation may result in additional PTMs. removal of this tyrosine produces a loss of protection against both IAV and DENV (Fig. 4A) values are the mean percentages of infected cells of three separate experiments. cell peripheries are outlined based on DIC images. bar = 10 m. (C) Confocal images of the indicated cells immunostained for IFITM3 (red), CD63 (green), and stained for DNA (blue). cells expressing the Y99A mutant protein showed that IAV replication was enhanced compared to wild-type IFITM3. intriguingly, the cells expressing the mutant protein still restricted DENV infection. the Y99A mutant protein was expressed to levels similar to those of IFITM3 and has an intracellular distribution indistinguishable from wild-type. 3 with LAMP1 being 0.6 0.1 and 1.0 0.2, respectively. in contrast, R87A offered less protection from IAV than against DENV. to assess which individual amino acids in the most C-terminal portion of the CIL (103AS) were needed for restriction, we substituted either K104 or C105 with alanine. the HA-tagged protein, MDA9, did not interact with IFITM3. amino acids 67 to 85 within IM1 were required for IFITM association. the most critical residues were amino acids 73 to 78. imaging showed that the F75A/F78A double mutant was expressed similarly to WT IFITM3. we also detected an interaction between endogenous IFITM3 and a stably expressed IFITM3 containing a single HA tag. this interaction was enhanced after IFN- treatment was used to increase endogenous IFITM3 levels. IFITM3 is the most potent in preventing IAV replication (1). FITM3's NTD (amino acids 1 to 50) was fused in frame with IFITM1's amino acids 29 to 245 or IFITM2's amino acids 50 to 118 to generate M3M1 and M3M2. the NTD of IFITM1, amino acids 1 to 28, or the NTD of IFITM2, amino acids 51 to 119, was fused to IFITM3, amino acids 51 to 119, to produce M1M3 and M IFITM1 (M1; green), IFITM2 (M2; blue), and IFITM3 (M3; red) are shown with their respective IM1, CIL, and IM2 domains. the remaining protein regions color coded based on their origin are shown below. M1M3 was seen to be more finely distributed in a pattern that extended to the cell's periphery and surface, somewhat similar to the pattern of expression of IFITM1 or that of the Y20 IFITM3 point mutant. in contrast, M3M1 was situated more centrally with a coarser staining pattern, showing its location in larger intracellular organelles that, based on earlier work, are lysosomes and autolysosomes, a three SNPs, V31M/rs199582787, P70T/rs199749095, and G95R/rs1744108 were not present in the 1000GENOMES data most likely due to their MAFs of 0.2%, 6.4%, and 1.4%, respectively, in European and African American populations. the project provides evidence for miscallments of the SNPs due to misassignments occurring during human genome assembly and SNP calling. the allele frequencies were derived from Agilent whole-exome sequencing of 662 participants of European descent. footnote 2 indicates that the polymorphism was identified in the Coriell Apparently Healthy Collection (AGI_ASP_population) a Bold italic font indicates that the major variant is the same in both IFITM2 and IFITM3. however, the amino acids at these positions are identical in IFITM3 and IFITM2 suggesting that these SNPs were accurately called as nonsynonymous in either IFITM3 or IFITM2. IFITM3 blocks IAV replication by altering the properties of the host cell's late endosomes and lysosomes, impeding virus-host membrane fusion (12). in contrast, G95R was expressed and localized similarly to both wild-type IFITM3 and P70T, while conferring 3-fold-less protection than either of these proteins. this model accounts for both the diversity of IFITM3-sensitive viruses and the short time in which IFITM3 acts to prevent viral cytosolic entry (5 to 30 min for IAV) the CD225 family is functionally uncharacterized; therefore, identifying these molecular determinants likely provides functional insights for several related proteins. cis leaflet (cis) and trans leaflet (trans) of the membrane are shown. cis leaflet (cis) and trans leaflet (trans) of the membrane are shown. abbreviated model of HA-mediated fusion. palmitoylation targets proteins to the endosomes and lysosomes, in some instances by first directing them to the cellular surface and periphery (22). abrogating the palmitoylation of three cysteines in IFITM3's IM1 and CIL (C71, C72, and C105) was reported to be needed for proper localization and IAV inhibition. alanine substitution of either C71 or C105 did not perturb antiviral action point mutations across the span of amino acids altered in the 19AS protein revealed that mutating a single residue, Y20, altered the localization of IFITM3 to late endosomes and lysosomes. this is similar to a confirmed lysosomal sorting signal, NPXY, that is important for low-density lipoprotein receptor trafficking. four out of 21 IFITM3 AS proteins were expressed poorly. the restriction factor was endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes. the third class of IFITM3 mutants involves two critical residues in IM1, F75 and F78. intramembranous interactions between adjacent IFITM3 proteins may decrease membrane fluidity and alter the bending modulus of the endosomal membrane. by extension, IFITM3's presence in the viral envelope could decrease membrane fluidity, thereby inhibiting rearrangement of host membrane-engaged viral envelopes. several molecular determinants necessary for IFITM3's restriction of IAV or DENV reside in its CD225 domain. IM1 contains F75 and F78, which are important for an intermolecular interaction, as well as C72. within the CIL, R85, R87, Y99, and K104 were all found to be needed for IFITM3's function. alanine substitution of either C71 or C105 did not perturb antiviral action or intracellular distribution. alanine substitution of C72 appears to be a nonredundant IFITM3 PTM required for inhibition of IAV and DENV. alanine substitution of either C71 or C105 did not perturb antiviral action or intracellular distribution. the loss of Y20, which is not present in IFITM1, partially accounts for the differential localization of the two paralogs. mutating all four lysines in IFITM3 (K24, K83, K88, and K104) was reported to decrease ubiquitination and IFITM3 turnover leading to enhanced restriction. amino acids 55 to 66 direct the initial positioning of IM1 with the membrane. the third class of IFITM3 mutants involves two critical residues in IM1, F75 and F78. the third class of IFITM3 mutants involves two critical residues in IM1, f75 and f78. a class of mutations separates IFITM's characteristic dual inhibition of either IAV or DENV. they included AS proteins 43AS, 49AS, and 97AS, as well as the point mutant proteins, Y99A and R87A. this class of mutations separates IFITM's characteristic dual inhibition of either IAV or DENV. the results of this analysis show that C72, F75, R85, and K104 are among the most well conserved residues. Y99 is known to be phosphorylated and therefore represents a potential means of regulation. however, Y99 is not well conserved across the CD225 domain family."}
