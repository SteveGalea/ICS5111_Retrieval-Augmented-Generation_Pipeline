HEK293T cells were infected with teicoplanin at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the cells were then infected with HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses. after 24 h, the cells were transfected with 200 nm siRNAs against NPC1 and ACE2 respectively. the cells were infected with HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) or HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses. the results are representative of at least three independent experiments. dextran-Alexa Fluor 568 could be transported into lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosomes within 2 h of uptake. the co-localization coefficient of dextran and LAMP1 was influenced by siRNA knockdown of VPS39 and VPS41. teicoplanin does not inhibit the transport of dextran-Alexa Fluor 568. HEK293T cells were incubated with 50 m teicoplanin or control for 48 h. another group was transfected with siRNAs against VPS39 and VPS41. the cells were incubated with dextran-Alexa Flour 568 for 2 h in 1% serum-containing DMEM. the bars show the mean values S.D. (error bars) the p value was determined by a Student's t test. the p value was determined by a Student's t test. n.s., not significant; ***, p 0.001. the IC50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the Ebola entry is approximately four times greater than that of Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones. the high doses of teicoplanin determined to be required for the inhibition of cathepsin L enzymatic activity could be due to the relatively low sensitivity of the cathepsin L activity assay. the cells were infected with HIV-luc/Zaire EBOV-GP (2014) or HIV-luc/VSV-G pseudotyped viruses. after incubation for 48 h, the intracellular luciferase activity was measured. teicoplanin and its glycopeptide antibiotic homologs dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and vancomycin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola trVLPs. the target cells were also pre-transfected with NP, VP35, VP30, L, T7, and Tim1 plasmids to produce infectious Ebola trVLPs. the IC50 of teicoplanin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs was 330 nm. dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and vancomycin were also determined. however, vancomycin did not inhibit Ebola trVLP entry. pCAGGS-VP35, 7.5 ng of pCAGGS-VP30, 100 ng of pCAGGS-L, 25 ng of pCAGGS-T7, and 25 ng of pCAGGS-Tim1 plasmids were incubated with teicoplanin. after 24 h, the medium was discarded, and the cells were incubated with teicoplanin at various concentrations at 37 \u00b0 teicoplanin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin inhibit the entry of Ebola trVLPs, MERS-CoVs, and SARS-CoVs. however, vancomycin does not exert antiviral activity. peptide antibiotics with the exception of vancomycin exhibit broad antiviral activity because of their inhibitory effects on cathepsin L. the cells were infected with HIV-luc/MERS-CoV-S or HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses. the IC50 value of teicoplanin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs is as low as 330 nm. the CC50 of teicoplanin is over 500 m. it also inhibits the entry of MERS-CoV/HIV-1 and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses. teicoplanin represses the entry of both Ebola and SARS-CoVs. teicoplanin does not affect the functions of HOPS complexes. the target of teicoplanin was cathepsin L, which can explain why teicoplanin inhibited both the entry of Ebola and respiratory syncytial viruses. teicoplanin homologs dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and vancomycin inhibit the entry of trVLPs, MERS-CoV/HIV-1 and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses. vancomycin lacks the hydrophobic groups, which might be the reason why it does not inhibit these viral infections. glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, is better tolerated with lower nephrotoxicity (52) the serum concentrations of teicoplanin are at least 15 mg/liter (8.78 m), which is 27, 14, and 2 times higher than the IC50 values of teicoplanin against the entry of Ebola viruses, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1."}
