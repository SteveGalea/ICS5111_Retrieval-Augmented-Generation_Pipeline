{"summary": "the data have been obtained using established cell lines and/or CXCR4-tropic virus strains. there is also ambiguity about which disulfide isomerases play a major role in HIV-1 entry. findings demonstrate role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 entry in primary T lymphocytes and MDM. they establish a cell-type specificity regarding the involvement of particular disulfide isomerases/reductases in this process. the elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages. HIV-1 Env contains 10 disulfide bonds (nine in the gp120 and one in the gp41 subunits, respectively). the observed potent suppression of HIV-1 infection by disulfide isomerase inhibitors has revealed the importance of thiol/disulfide exchange during virus entry [16-21]. R5 strains of HIV-1 are primarily involved in virus transmission. they predominate during the early and asymptomatic stages of infection. they predominate during the early and asymptomatic stages of infection. our results provide critical new information on the role of disulfide isomerases in HIV infection. DTNB exposure potently reduced infection by HIV-1JR-FL or HIV-1AD8 Env-pseudotyped virions without impairing cell viability. DTNB also caused a similar dose-dependent suppression of HIV-1JR-FL Env-pseudotyped virion infection of the JC53 CD4+/CCR5+ cell line, as well as primary macrophages and PBMCs. the infection was carried out for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C in a serum free medium. cell lysates from mock-infected cells and from cells not treated with DTNB were used as a negative control and control. DTNB inhibits HIV-1 particle fusion with primary human cells and CD4+/CCR5+ cell lines. DTNB inhibits fusion/entry of virions in JC53 cells, primary human PBMCs and primary human PBMCs. JC53 cells, primary human PBMCs and PBMCs were cultured as described in Methods. DTNB was dissolved in pre-warmed phenol red free DMEM. the primary human MDM (C) were cultured in a borosilicate glass bottom plate. the experiments were performed in triplicates. DTNB was able to suppress infection by all three isolates with levels of reverse transcriptase activity approaching those observed. anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs significantly inhibited MDM infection by all three HIV-1 strains tested. however, data obtained from multiple experiments performed with HIV-1ADA established that the anti-Trx mAb was more efficient in reducing RT values and delaying the time of peak RT activity during infection. similar results were obtained when anti-PDI and/or anti-Trx treated PM-1 cells were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 Env pseudotyped virions. anti-PDI mAb, but not anti-Trx mAb, significantly reduced the RT values and delayed the peak RT activity when PM-1 cells were infected with the X4 strain, HIV-1LAV. PM-1cells were infected with HIV-1ADA (panel B) or HIV-1LAV (panel C) after infection for 2 h in the presence of the aforementioned inhibitors, the PM-1 cells were washed and further incubated in RC-10 without DTNB or mAbs. primary human PHA stimulated PBLs were infected with HIV-1JR-FL Env-pseudotyped virus particles. the differences between control and anti-PDI or control and anti-Trx treated cells were found to be statistically significant for all donors tested. the differences between the control and anti-PDI treated cells and between the control and anti-Trx treated cells were found to be statistically significant for all donors tested when primary data (RLU) were used to calculate the relevant P values. PDI and Trx are expressed the cell surface of PM-1 cells, primary MDM and PBLs. the same mAb clones used to inhibit HIV-1 infection were directly conjugated to different fluorescent dyes. PDI and Trx are predominantly found as intracellular proteins. PDI and Trx levels on the cell surface were detected by a combination of directly labeled anti-PDI-FITC and anti-Trx-APC mAbs. DTNB inhibits R5 Env pseudotyped virus infection in CD4+/CCR5+ cell lines, primary macrophages and PBMCs. DTNB exposure potently reduced infection by HIV-1JR-FL or HIV-1AD8 Env-pseudotyped virions without impairing cell viability. DTNB incubation also has no effect on Luc activity in cells directly electroporated with the pNL4-3 e-R+ Luc plasmid. the infection was carried out for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C in a serum free medium. cell lysates from mock-infected cells and from cells not treated with DTNB were used as a negative control and control. DTNB inhibits HIV-1 particle fusion with primary human cells and CD4+/CCR5+ cell lines. cells electroporated with pMM310 (pcDNA3.1(Zeo)-Vpr-BlaM) showed no significant difference in the number of blue cells compared to cells incubated in DMEM only. DTNB significantly inhibited fusion of HIV-1AD8 BlaM-containing virions with both the JC53 CD4+/CCR5+ cell line. incubated in DM-10 (phenol red free, supplemented with 2.5 mM Probenecid) for 14 h in tissue culture plates at RT in the dark. the JC53 cells and the human PBMCs were transferred to microfuge tubes, fixed with 1.6% pareformaldehyde and analyzed using BD LSR II cell fluorometer. anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs significantly inhibited MDM infection by all three HIV-1 strains tested. however, data obtained from multiple experiments performed with HIV-1ADA established that the anti-Trx mAb was more efficient in reducing RT values and delaying the time of peak RT activity during infection. anti-PDI mAbs inhibited the infection of PM-1 cells by Luc reporter gene virus particles in a dose dependent manner. in contrast, the anti-Trx mAbs had no effect on the latter infection. similar results were obtained when anti-PDI and/or anti-Trx treated PM-1 cells were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 Env pseudotyped virions. Luc reporter gene-encoding virus particles for 2.5 h in the presence of the different mAbs. cells were washed and further incubated for 48 h in RC-10 before being lysed with 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS and Luc activity was measured. PM-1cells were infected with HIV-1ADA or HIV-1LAV (panel B) an opposite trend and statistically significant differences (P0.01) were established between the anti-PDI and anti-Trx treated cells for the PBL and MDM systems, respectively. the differences between the control and anti-PDI treated cells and between the control and anti-Trx treated cells were found to be statistically significant for all donors tested. anti-PDI or anti-Trx mAbs treated cells were calculated as a percent of the mean Luc activity of cells pre-incubated and infected in the presence of nonspecific mouse IgG. PDI and Trx are expressed the cell surface of PM-1 cells, primary MDM and PBLs. PM-1 cells and primary MDM expressed both PDI and Trx on their surface. PDI and Trx expression was very low on unstimulated and PHA-activated CD4+ lymphocytes, but increased significantly after PHA treatment. gp120 consists of five variable domains (V1-V5) interconnected by five more conserved regions (C1-C5) the gp41 ectodomain encompasses two hydrophobic regions with a characteristic coiled-coil structure, designated as heptad repeats 1 and 2, that are connected by a linker sequence forming a conserved disulfide bond [12,39,40] it is reasonable to suggest that some disulfide bonds could be modified right after CD4 binding. some rearrangements, such as the disulfide bond straddling the V3 loop, may undergo modification after the gp120-CD4-coreceptor complex is formed. the exact timing and role of the CD4 redox modifications during the process of virus fusion remain incompletely characterized. DTNB potently reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in primary cells to levels comparable to the observed inhibition in cell lines. anti-Trx mAbs proved to be more potent than anti-PDI mAbs in suppressing thiol/disulfide exchange. anti-Trx mAbs had negligible effects on the PM-1 T cell line and primary PBLs, while the anti-PDI mAbs significantly reduced HIV-1 infection in these cells. in support of this notion, both PDI and Trx were present on the plasma membrane of all cell types tested. cell surface molecules other than CD4 and CXCR4 may also interact with PDI or Trx and influence their redox status and/or availability during HIV-1 entry. the redox imbalance is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection, resulting in complex chain of events at intra- and extracellular levels. plasma Trx levels showed a significant inverse correlation with the survival rate of HIV-1-infected patients having a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/L [55] plasma Trx levels showed a significant inverse correlation with the survival rate of HIV-1-infected patients having a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/L [55] PDI may be relevant to the HIV-1 entry and establishment of virus reservoirs in resting CD4+ cells. elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages. the plasmids pNL4-3 e-R+ Luc, pSV7d-JR-FLgp160, pSV7d-AD8gp160 and pMM310 were provided by Dr. R.
