{"summary": "etiological agents of Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fevers are responsible for recurrent hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. the virus establish persistent infections in their host species, wild rodents, which act as natural reservoirs. CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61) cells were transfected with empty vector (mock) or plasmids expressing hTfR1 or human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor for SARS coronavirus (15) two days later, cells were infected with MLV pseudoviruses expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. total JUNV production over 24 h in a549 cell supernatants was measured using a PFU assay in vero cells. ch128.1 (previously known as anti-hTfR IgG3) does not compete with transferrin. the entry of MLV pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins (GP) of JUNV, GTOV, CHAV, SABV, and MACV was efficiently inhibited by ch128.1 at 50 nM. this inhibition was ch128.1 specific, since a control antibody (anti-HLA) did not inhibit any of the pseudoviruses tested. we then determined the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ch128.1 for these pseudoviruses in HEK2 HEK293T cells were preincubated on ice with increasing concentrations of ch128.1 or hIgG, MACVRBD-mI. ch128.1 has a high affinity for hTfR1 since the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for ch128.1 binding to the soluble ectodomain of hTfR1 was 5.7 nM. gG was added to obtain a concentration of 5 g/ml. binding was detected by flow cytometry with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse Fc antibody. data are means SD from two duplicated experiments. previously established hTfR1 determinants for MACV GP1 binding (23) are in green. surface-exposed residues (S338 to S368) of the putative ch128.1 binding site (S324 to S368) are indicated in yellow. ch128.1 binds nonhuman primate TfR1 orthologs and blocks JUNV pseudovirus entry into old world monkey cells. TfR1 sequences from M. mulatta, C. aethiops, A. trivirgatus, and C. jacchus were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using sMAGI, Vero, OMK, and CJ cell cDNAs. ch128.1 inhibits JUNV pseudovirus entry into old world primate cells. hek293T, sMAGI, and vero cells were preincubated with ch128.1. the percentage of positive cells was assessed 48 h later by flow cytometry and was normalized to that for mock-treated cells. ch128.1 does not compete with the two physiological ligands of TfR1, transferrin and hereditary hemochromatosis protein (20, 24), and therefore should interfere only marginally with known roles of TfR1. this risk is further reduced by the short duration of treatment required for these acute, fast-progressing hemorrhagic fevers."}
