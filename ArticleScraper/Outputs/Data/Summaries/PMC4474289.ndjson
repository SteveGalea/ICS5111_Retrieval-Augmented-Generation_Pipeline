{"summary": "viruses such as coronaviruses, herpesviruses, and orthomyxoviruses suppress host protein synthesis through mRNA decay. this shutoff serves to dampen host antiviral factor expression and redirect host translation apparatus to favor viral protein production. gene expression in infected cells, including expression of type I IFN gene and ISGs like those encoding beta interferon (IFN-), ISG15, and ISG56 (9) nsp1 plays a role in the interruption of the IFN signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation of STAT1. viral replication of MHV devoid of nsp1 was severely attenuated in the spleen and liver of infected wild-type (W we and Jagger et al. demonstrated that transfection of a PA-X expression plasmid inhibited reporter gene expression to a greater extent than the full PA ORF. also, PA-X with a mutation at an endonuclease active site failed to induce host shutoff activity. despite the difference in host shutoff, both viruses grew to similar titers (12). the effect of PA-X on viral pathogenicity was only tested with 1918 HP virus (12). seasonal human influenza viruses, including pH1N1 virus, do not induce an excessive host cytokine response. lack of PA-X expression allows more appropriate innate and acquired immune responses that are able to effectively attenuate virus replication and pathogenicity. the data shown are representative of two independent experiments. we evaluated the role of PA-X in viral growth and pathogenicity and host immune response using a currently circulating pH1N1 virus strain. in contrast to the results reported for the 1918 HP virus, we found that Cal PA-XFS induced IFN- to a greater extent than Cal WT in infected cultured cells and infected lungs. pPolCalHA-E3 (HA-E3) gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. pCAGGSCalPA-X134Aflag was subcloned to plasmid pCAGGS. other vectors for virus rescue of Cal viruses, pCAGGSCalPAflag, and pCAGGSCalPA-X134Aflag were constructed previously (15, 20) stock recombinant Cal virus possessing Cal HA was poorly adapted to growth conditions in culture cells and in mice as described previously. pPolCalPA-XFS was replaced with pPolCalPA-XFS. mutants in HA and PA sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. the cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (4 to 12% gel; Life Technologies) and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) the membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) cells were labeled with 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (PerkinElmer) at 50 Ci/ml for 30 min in medium lacking methionine and cysteine (Corning) the cells were then lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and 5% glycerol) 10% of culture supernatants were collected and titrated on MDCK cells. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA by reverse transcription. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA by reverse transcription. utions of each DNA ranging from 5 100 to 5 107 copies were used for creating the standard curve. amplification of human or mouse IFN- and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were performed using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense RNA probes as described previously. the body weight of each individual mouse was measured daily until 16 days postinfection. mice were infected intranasally with either PBS or a Cal virus at a dose of 101, 102 or 103 PFU. the antibody titer against HA was determined by ELISA. the plate was blocked with 1% BSA\u2013PBS for 1 h. the plate was then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. pPolCalHA-E3 (HA-E3) gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. the truncated Cal PA-X 134A C flag gene was subcloned to plasmid pCAGGS. other pPol-I and pCAGGS vectors for virus rescue of Cal viruses were constructed previously. stock recombinant Cal virus possessing Cal HA was poorly adapted to growth conditions in culture cells and in mice as described previously. pPolCalPA-XFS was replaced with pPolCalPA-XFS. mutants in HA and PA sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. the cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (4 to 12% gel; Life Technologies) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) the membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) cells were labeled with 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (PerkinElmer) at 50 Ci/ml for 30 min in medium lacking methionine and cysteine (Corning) the cells were then lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and 5% glycerol) at 2, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi, 10% of the culture supernatants were collected and titrated on MDCK cells. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA by reverse transcription using a primer with the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system. northern blot analysis was performed using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense RNA probes as described previously (25, 26) the extracted RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel prepared by using a formaldehyde-free RNA gel kit (Amresco) and then transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; GE Healthcare) the body weight of each individual mouse was measured daily until 16 days postinfection (dpi) mice were infected intranasally with either PBS or a Cal virus at a dose of 101, 102 or 103 PFU. the antibody titer against HA was determined by ELISA. purified Cal HA protein was used to coat a 96-well plate overnight at 4\u00b0C. the plate was blocked with 1% BSA\u2013PBS for 1 h. the plate was then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. fected cells first produced hybridoma cell lines which secrete MAbs specific for PA-X. we tested the reactivity of MAbs against PA, PA-X mutated at the endonuclease active site (PA-X134A), or PA-X134AC, which does not contain the unique C-terminal domain. two antibodies (F17-278 and F17-419) reacted with all three proteins. levels from both WT- and PA-XFS virus-infected cells were identical. mutations at the frameshift motif in PA resulted in reduced expression of PA-X in infected cells. PA-X contributes to the shutdown of host protein synthesis and degradation of actin mRNA. at 12 hpi, the actin mRNA level in Cal WT-infected cells was reduced by 50.6% 7.9% (mean standard deviation) compared to the level in mock-infected cells, while there was only an 11.2% 7.8% reduction by Cal PA-XFS. these data strongly suggest that PA-X contributes to the shutdown of host protein synthesis. RNAs were stained with ethidium bromide and are shown as a loading control. the data are representative of two (A) or three (C and D) independent experiments. PA-X expression is required for efficient virus replication and suppression of the host antiviral response in vitro. the cells were left uninfected or infected with Cal WT or Cal PA-XFS at an MOI of 0.025. at the indicated time points, 10% of the supernatant was collected and titrated on MDCK cells. the data represent averages with standard deviations from two independent experiments. efficient viral growth in vitro led us to assess the impact of PA-X expression on virus pathogenicity in mice. we compared the viral growth and IFN- mRNA levels in lungs of mice infected with Cal WT and Cal PA-XFS. iters of Cal PA-XFS induced IFN- mRNA to a greater extent than Cal WT in the lungs of infected mice at 5 dpi. findings suggest that PA-X plays a role in efficient virus replication. hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained images of uninfected or infected lungs at 8 dpi. the lungs showed moderate inflammation, with immune infiltrates in alveolar air spaces and the areas surrounding bronchioles. the lungs of Cal PA-XFS-infected mice showed moderate inflammation. the serum dilutions from Cal PA-XFS-infected mice were 2.67-, 1.55-, or 1.33-fold higher than those from Cal WT-infected mice. these results indicate that Cal PA-XFS infection produced more neutralizing antibodies than Cal WT infection. similar patterns were seen when we used purified ribonucleoprotein as an antigen. data shown are the averages with standard deviations of the results from 4 or 5 (control, 101, or 102 PFU virus) or 2 or 3 (103 PFU virus) individual mice. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences by the Student t test. reactivity of MAbs against PA, PA-X mutated at the endonuclease active site (PA-X134A), or PA-X134AC, does not contain the unique C-terminal domain. three antibodies (F17-112, F17-169, and F17-300) reacted with all three proteins. radioimmunoprecipitation was then carried out on lysates from cells infected with Cal WT or Cal PA-XFS mutations at the frameshift motif in PA result in reduced expression of PA-X in infected cells. PA-X contributes to the shutdown of host protein synthesis and degradation of actin mRNA. at 4 hpi, neither virus protein synthesis nor suppression of host protein synthesis was detected in Cal WT- and Cal PA-XFS-infected cells. Cal WT infection reduced actin mRNA level by 52.2% 7.3% in human cells. no reduction was seen in Cal PA-XFS-infected cells. PA-X expression is required for efficient virus replication and suppression. the more efficient viral growth of Cal WT compared to that of Cal PA-XFS suggests that PA-X may play a role in suppressing host innate immune responses. the induction of type I IFN establishes an antiviral state which impedes viral replication and spread through the host cells. the cells were left uninfected or infected with either Cal WT or Cal PA-XFS at an MOI of 0.025. at the indicated time points, total RNA was extracted and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. the body weights of mice infected with 102 PFU of Cal WT or Cal PA-XFS were reduced to 77.9% or 79.5%, respectively, by 9 dpi. however, mice infected with 102 PFU recovered more rapidly than those infected with Cal WT. this suggests that viral clearance in lungs infected with Cal PA-XFS occurs faster than in those infected with Cal WT. fected mice were either mock infected or infected with Cal viruses. survival (A) and body weight (B) of each mouse were monitored daily until 16 dpi. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences by the Student t test. lungs showed moderate inflammation, with immune infiltrates in alveolar air spaces. lungs of Cal PA-XFS-infected mice showed greater degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration than those of Cal WT-infected lungs. this mutant induced stronger host cytokine responses than Cal WT. mice were 2.67-, 1.55-, or 1.33-fold higher than those from Cal WT-infected mice at a dose of 101, 102, or 103 PFU. these results indicate that Cal PA-XFS infection produced more neutralizing antibodies than Cal WT infection. similar patterns were seen when we used purified ribonucleoprotein as an antigen. antibody titers were determined by ELISA on 96-well plate using Cal HA protein (0.1 g/well) as an antigen. data shown are the averages with standard deviations of the results from 4 or 5 (control, 101, or 102 PFU virus) or 2 or 3 (103 PFU virus) individual mice. the effects of PA-X on viral growth vary between the highly pathogenic strains and seasonal influenza viruses. the induction of type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) is an important step to establish a host antiviral state that restricts virus replication. endonuclease activity of PA-X is required for suppression of reporter protein production (12, 15) infection with Cal WT but not with Cal PA-XFS reduced the actin mRNA level in the infected cells. it is possible that PA-X may interact with host transcription and/or translation apparatus and interrupt host protein expression. a 1918 HP PA-XFS mutant caused more severe weight loss of mice, as well as high induction of host genes related to the immune response and inflammation in the infected lungs. this suggests that the host immune response in the lungs infected with PA-XFS virus enhances viral pathogenicity due to the accelerated and increased cytokine response. PA-X contributes to virus replication, possibly through the inhibition of host innate and acquired immune responses. findings suggest that PA-X contributes to virus replication."}
