{"summary": "DCs are a type of antigen (Ag)-presenting cell (APC) that are distributed in lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, skin, and blood. 1,2 APCs incorporate exogenous Ags by endocytosis, execute their processing into fragments, and immediately display them for recognition by adaptive nave T cells. DCs play a central role in immune defense against exogenous pathogens. nonviral vectors are more efficient than passive targeting due to their specific interactions with DC surface molecules. these nonviral vectors may in part solve the viral vector-related problems described above. however, they potentially lack the mechanisms for infection and endosomal escape (eg, membrane fusiogenic domain of viral envelope proteins) ZZ-BNCs displaying -epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies efficiently targeted EGFR-overexpressing glioblastoma in vivo following intracerebroventricular injection. these properties of ZZ-BNCs may be useful for active targeting and the introduction of Ags to DCs. Z-averages and -potentials of ZZ-BNCs were measured in water at 25\u00b0C. antibodies Armenian hamster monoclonal -CD11c IgG (clone N418), rat -major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II IgG2b (clone 223H7) and Armenian hamster IgG isotype control were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) FITC, clone N418) was from Miltenyi Biotech (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) the number of IgG molecules bound to ZZ-BNCs was determined by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) model Twin-Q (As One Corp, Osaka, Japan) ex vivo attachment assay to splenic DCs Splenic DCs were isolated from female mice. spleens were treated with a gentleMACSTM dissociator. the CF750-derived fluorescence (emission 777 nm) was excited with a xenon lamp and emission filter (from 708 to 752 nm), and obtained through a 770-nm interference barrier filter. spleenocytes were dissociated in MACS buffer with a gentleMACSTM dissociator. complexes of ZZ-BNCs were mixed with 600 g of cationic LPs. the complexes were separated by CsCl isopycnic ultracentrifugation (5%\u201340% (w/v)) in a rotor at 24,000 rpm at 25\u00b0C for 16 hours. aliquot of -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes was administered to each mouse. after 4 weeks, booster immunization was carried out with -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes (20 g as D3 antigen) BNCs and ZZ-BNCs were overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22R cells. BNCs and ZZ-BNCs were purified as described previously. rat -CD16/CD32 IgG2b (clone 2.4G2) and isotype controls of rat IgG2a and rat IgG2b were from BD Bioscience Pharmingen. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled -CD11c (-CD11c-FITC, clone N418) was from Miltenyi Biotech. -DC-ZZ-BNC complexes Displaying of -DC IgGs on the surface of ZZ-BNCs was carried out by chemical crosslinking. spleens were treated with a gentleMACSTM dissociator (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) FITC-derived fluorescence (emission 520 nm) was excited by a 488-nm laser. Cy5-derived fluorescence (emission 670 nm) was excited by a 633-nm laser. each mouse was injected intravenously with 100 L of PBS containing 10 g of CF750-labeled ZZ-BNCs conjugated with each -DC IgG. the cells were subjected to quantitative analysis using the flow cytometer BD FACScan Canto II with linear amplification for forward/side scatter and logarithmic amplification for FITC and Cy5 fluorescence. whole cell Z-stacks (each slice = 0.25 m, total 15 sections) were acquired by the LSM. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP complexes were combined and dialyzed against PBS overnight. aliquot of -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes (20 g as D3 antigen) was administered to each mouse (BALB/c female, 7 weeks, Japan SLC) intravenously. serially diluted rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:4000; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) were added to wells, followed by HRP substrate. after 20 minutes of incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 N sulfuric acid. hamster IgGs were observed to be bound to ZZ-BNCs with high affinity. rat IgG2a and IgG2b were weakly bound to ZZ-BNCs. rat IgG2a and IgG2b were weakly bound to ZZ-BNCs. -DC-ZZ-BNCs accumulated on 86% and 84% of splenic DCs. the difference in DC accumulation may be caused by either the number of antibodies on ZZ-BNC or the affinity of each antibody to DCs. Flow cytometric analysis of ex vivo attachment of -DC-ZZ-BNC complexes to splenic DCs. Splenic DCs were incubated with each Cy5-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complex. distributions of Cy5-derived fluorescence in ZZ-BNC-incubated DCs are indicated as numbers. CF750-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complexes were excreted into the bladder within 10 minutes of injection. each organ was observed for CF750-derived fluorescence on an OV-100 in vivo imaging system. spleen contains a larger number of lymphoid-resident DCs than the liver. fluorescent values of each organ in ROI were analyzed using WASABI software. error bars indicate the SD; **P 0.01; *P 0.05. spleens were extirpated 40 minutes after injection. clone N418)-ZZ-BNC complexes were detected in 2.0% of CD11c splenocytes. the complexes have high specificity to splenic CD11c+ cells in vivo. the percentages of ZZ-BNC+ cells in DCs and CD11c cells are indicated as numbers. splenic DCs isolated from -DC-ZZ-BNC complex-injected mice. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC complexes could accumulate in splenic DCs. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC complexes could accumulate in splenic DCs. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes were shown to form a stable complex with LP spontaneously and deliver the complex in a cell- and tissue-specific manner in vivo and in vivo. the complexes consisted of 19.5 g/mL of ZZ-L protein and 65.6 g/mL of LPs, of which the Z-average (diameter) and -potential were 426 nm -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes, LP-D3 complexes, and LP-D3 complexes were 455 nm (PDI, 0.398), 324 nm (PDI, 0.261), and 106 nm (PDI, 0.130), respectively. the conjugation with LPs increased their diameters to greater than 100 nm. 11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes elicited high titers of -D3 IgGs at 6 weeks. other control vaccines containing the same amounts of D3 antigen did not. -CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNC-LP complexes accumulated in splenic DCs in vivo. the -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes are postulated to accumulate in splenic DCs, stimulate DCs with D3 antigens, move DCs from the marginal zone to the splenic T cell zone. this result strongly suggested that DCs in the splenic marginal zone were stimulated with Ags in a CD11c-dependent manner and then migrated into the splenic T cell zone. gG2b and rat -CD16/CD32 IgG2b were found to label splenic DCs more efficiently than the others. rat IgG2a and IgG2b were weakly bound to ZZ-BNCs. 4.4 1.5 14.9 1.7 -CD16/CD32 51.7 0.4 14.9 1.0 Mouse total IgG 152 8.3 25.2 0.8 BNC \u2013 69.0 0.2 14.9 1.3 Notes: Measurements were performed in triplicate. cell surface molecules on splenic DCs show high affinity to IgGs and ZZ-BNCs. splenic DCs were incubated with each Cy5-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complex. splenic DCs were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. CF750-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complexes were excreted into the bladder within 10 minutes of injection. mice were sacrificed at 40 minutes after injection and subjected to the extirpation of the heart, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen. both CF750-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNCs localized in the liver and spleen preferentially. in vivo distribution of CF750-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complexes was observed. fluorescence in each extirpated organ was observed using an OV-100 imaging system 40 minutes after intravenous injection into mice. -CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNC complexes were detected in a lower population of CD11c+ splenocytes. the other Cy5-labeled ZZ-BNC complexes, and Cy5-labeled BNCs, were detected in 2.0% of CD11c+ splenocytes. the percentages (%) of splenic CD11c cells in DCs and CD11c cells are indicated as numbers. splenic DCs isolated from Cy5-labeled -DC-ZZ-BNC complex-injected mice. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes were shown to form a stable complex with LP spontaneously and deliver the complex in a cell- and tissue-specific manner in vivo and in vivo. the complexes consisted of 19.5 g/mL of ZZ-L protein and 65.6 g/mL of LPs, of which the Z-average (diameter) and -potential were 426 nm the Z-averages and -potentials of -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes were 455 nm (PDI, 0.398), 324 nm (PDI, 0.261), and 106 nm (PDI, 0.130), and 9.53 mV, 1.87 mV, and 43.4 mV. at 4 and 6 weeks, no significant elicitation of -D3 IgGs was observed in any mouse. only -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes elicited high titers of -D3 IgGs at 6 weeks. other control vaccines containing the same amounts of D3 antigen did not. -CD11c F(ab)2-conjugated Ags accumulated in the splenic marginal zone following intravenous injection. -MHC class II F(ab)2-conjugated Ags accumulated in the splenic B cell zone. this result strongly suggested that DCs in the splenic marginal zone were stimulated with Ags in a CD11c-dependent manner. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC complex could elicit -D3 IgG more efficiently than other nontargeting control vaccines. -CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP complexes loaded with JEV antigens could elicit -D3 IgG more efficiently than other nontargeting control vaccines."}
