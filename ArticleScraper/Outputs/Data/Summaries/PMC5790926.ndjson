{"summary": "Ebola virus is a filamentous RNA virus that belongs to the Filoviridae family (1). it has a negative-stranded RNA genome (19 kb) that contains seven genes. the mechanism by which it is maintained in its natural reservoirs is not fully understood (2). EBOV-GP-pseudotyped viruses are still different from wild-type Ebola virus. they differ in their biological properties and susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. a panel of antibodies and sera has compared 22 different assays with the wild-type Ebola virus. the E-S-FLU virus does not contain any genetic material from the Ebola virus. it can infect cell lines that do not express EBOV-GP or influenza virus HA for only a single cycle. the virus is a useful surrogate for Ebola virus in in vitro studies. cells were stained with primary MAb KZ52 (anti-GP MAb) or 21D85A (anti-H5 MAb) and an FITC-linked anti-human secondary antibody. infected cells express eGFP that is encoded in the virus. /ml was calculated as 2 106 in the E-S-FLU virus batch and 1.6 108 in the H5 S-FLU virus batch. however, the harvested culture supernatant from E-SIAT cells contains adequate pseudovirions for 50 l of a 1:4 dilution to give close to full infection of the 3 104 cells in a well of a 96-well plate. no further purification or concentration steps are needed for the screening of inhibitory drugs a total of 100 TCID50 of seed S-FLU virus was added to 3 104 MDCK-SIAT1, E-SIAT, or H5-SIAT cells. live images of representative plaques were taken by IncuCyte every 3 h. the virus requires NPC1 receptor expression for infection of HeLa cells. the virus contains an eGFP reporter gene. the percentage of infected cells is the percentage of cells with a GFP readout of >102. KZ52 neutralized the E-S-FLU virus and the GP-lenti pseudotyped virus with an EC50 similar to what has been reported for wild-type Ebola virus (300 ng/ml [35]) the neutralization effect was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. a summary of the EC50s of MAbs KZ52 and 21D85A for the three pseudotyped viruses is shown in panel D. a value of 10,000 ng/ml was assigned to antibodies that did not neutralize. infected cells express eGFP, shown as green cells. IC50s of 13 drugs that inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection selected from the literature Drug (rank in Table S1) Mechanism geometric mean IC50, Ma (95% CI) IC50 (M) in literature Virus Reference LogP pKab Amiodarone (18) Calcium channel inhibitor 2.04 (0.547.76) 0.4 Wild-type EBOV 37 7.2 8.5 Verapamil (71) 10.6 (2.759.8) 3.1 Wild-type EB all screenings in Table 1 were repeated at least three times to calculate the geometric mean IC50 and 95% confidence interval (CI) most of them did not inhibit the H5-S-FLU virus, except niclosamide at 2.64 M. toxicity of tetrandrine at 25 M resulted in a reduction in the number of cells in the bright-field channel. many of the drug molecules that inhibited Ebola virus have high logP and pKa values. the LOPAC1280 library contains 1,280 pharmacologically active small molecules with different molecular targets. all of the drugs were screened in the first round at 100 and 5 M. 58 of the 1,280 molecules inhibited the virus to some level before reaching toxicity in vitro. of 1,280 small molecules, 215 inhibited the E-S-FLU virus. they are grouped and displayed according to their pharmacological activities. twenty-five molecules inhibited the H5-S-FLU virus. 7 C6628 Chloroquine diphosphate 200 5.44 67.0 Reduction 48 03-B7 PZ0171 CP-100356 monohydrochloride 50 6.80 20.0 Reduction 54 02-H5 A9809 Amsacrine hydrochloride 25 7.68 6.76 Reduction 61 02-E10 A255 A-77636 hydrochloride 25 8.60 15.6 Reduction 63 08-E9 H127 Hexahydro-sila-difen twenty-two drugs are from the LOPAC1280 library. we quantified infection by measuring the overall fluorescence level of cells. 12 of these drugs caused a reduced overall fluorescence level of infected cells. inhibitors noninhibitors Total Inhibitors 23 70 93 Noninhibitors 26 419 445 Both 49 489 538 a total of 538 drugs appeared in both our LOPAC1280 library screening and that of Johansen et al. (40) one of the main differences between the two screenings is the range of drug concentrations tested. d609, doxylamine, disopyramide, linezolid, naproxen, rotenone, and sanguinarine were confirmed as noninhibitors of the E-S-FLU virus. a lentiviral vector was used to incorporate EBOV-GP into the S-FLU virus envelope. transduced cells were healthy in morphology. EBOV-GP was expressed at the cell surface and can be detected with GP-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) KZ52. cells with high expression of EBOV-GP were sorted and stored as the E-SIAT cell line. the e-S-FLU virus reaches a lower titer than viruses grown in H5 HA-transduced producer cells. the typical 50% effective concentration (EC50) dilutions of the E-S-FLU virus at 48 h were 1:8, compared to 1:500 for the H5-S-FLU virus. culture supernatant harvested after 48 h was titrated in comparison to the H5-S-FLU virus. infected cells expressing eGFP were detected and quantified with a CLARIOstar fluorescence plate reader. the GP-HA protein can be detected with MAb KZ52 at the surface of EH-SIAT cells at a level similar to that on E-SIAT cells. however, to our surprise, no infective S-FLU virus was detected in the E-SIAT cell supernatant. the Niemann Pick C1 protein has been identified as the key entry receptor for Ebola virus at the level of late endosome/lysosome membrane (31\u201333) GP-lenti is a lentivirus pseudotyped with the full-length Zaire strain EBOV-GP matched to the E-S-FLU virus. the antibody microneutralization (MN) was tested in comparison with control pseudotype H5-S-FLU virus and an EBOV-GP-coated lentivirus pseudotype (GP-lenti) the antibody is coated with correctly folded EBOV-GP. antibody neutralization of pseudotyped E-S-FLU virus, H5-S-FLU virus, and EBOV-GP-pseudotyped lentivirus. antibodies were titrated in 2-fold dilutions from 10 g/ml. after 24 h, infection was quantified by measuring eGFP expression (influenza virus) or luminescence (lentivirus). drug molecules with diverse pharmacological functions have inhibited Ebola virus infection in vitro. e-S-FLU virus infection was effectively blocked by different groups of drugs. the drug concentrations at which eGFP fluorescence was reduced by 50% were in the same range. 4.5 9.4 EBOV (VLPs) 42 3.2 8.4 U18666A (21) NPC1 phenotype inducer 2.32 (0.1928.8) 3.0 rVSV-EBOV-GP 32 5.5 9.4 Arbidol (39) Fusion inhibitor 5.17 (0.6043.7) 5.97 Wild-type EBOV 40 5.1 9.9 EIPA (106) Macropinocytosis inhibitor 17.8 (14.122.4) 25.0 Wild-type EBOV 41 Toxicity reduces the WGA fluorescence as cells detach from the plastic. toxicity of tetrandrine at 25 M resulted in a reduction in the number of cells in the bright-field channel. cationic amphiphiles inhibited Ebola virus entry, such as 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) (41, 46), MDL28170 (43, 47), E64 (43, 44, 48\u201350), and niclosamide (40, 42) all of the drugs were screened in the first round at 100 and 5 M. 215 inhibitors belong to a variety of pharmacological groups according to the description on Sigma's website. of 1,280 small molecules, 215 inhibited both the E-S-FLU and H5-S-FLU virus. name highest concn (M) tested IC50 (M) for: Effect E-S-FLU H5-S-FLU 5 12-G4 O3125 Ouabain 1.5 0.28 0.3 Reduction 7 14-B2 R1402 Raloxifene HCl 50 0.40 33.8 Reduction 14 11-G7 N3510 Niclosamide 25 1.69 3.2 Reduction 21 U3633 U18666A 100 2.56 49.5 Reduction 27 04-B11 C8903 100 2.50 1.9 Dimmer 60 05-D6 D0670 Dihydroouabain 25 8.30 5.7 Dimmer 104 13-B10 SML0678 Pyridostatin trifluoroacetate salt 200 17.40 58.8 Dimmer 135 05-B9 D3768 Dequalinium chloride hydrate 100 27.30 12.1 Dimmer 145 14-C9 S3378 Spironolactone 100 30.40 33.1 Dimmer 159 2778-5 the two libraries have 538 drugs in common (Table 3) the results obtained with 442 of them agreed; 23 of them were inhibitors, and 419 had no effect. of the rest of the drugs, 70 were positive in the LOPAC1280 screening only. all three drugs had an inhibitory effect on the E-S-FLU virus with IC50s comparable to those in the LOPAC1280 library screening. ebastine (E9531), imipramine (I7379) and verapamil (V4629) were ordered individually from Sigma. LU virus in our assay up to 100 M were toxic to MDCK-SIAT1 cells even at 0.2 M. none of the drugs that were further tested inhibited the H5-S-FLU virus. eGFP fluorescence in most cells is stable over months after fixation. infection is fully dependent on the NPC1 receptor (Fig. 3), is inhibited by the EBOV-GP-specific MAb KZ52 (35, 36) and is also inhibited by a well-characterized set of 13 drugs that are thought to act at various points during viral entry (37\u201342) at least 17 calcium channel inhibitors identified as specific inhibitors of E-S-FLU virus infection. independent evidence exists for a possible role for calcium channels in the lysosomal membrane in viral entry. cationic amphiphilic drugs can cause an increase in cholesterol accumulation in endosomes and lysosomes, where EBOV-GP membrane fusion occurs. inhibition of the potassium channel hERG (human ether-a-go-go) in cardiac myocytes is commonly associated with long-QT syndrome (65) most of these hERG binders are typical cationic amphiphilic drugs. further dissection of their mechanisms of action is therefore necessary before they can be administered to Ebola virus-infected patients. spiranalactone and triamterene both have the dimmer effect. 13 of the 25 drugs that inhibited both the H5-S-FLU and E-S-FLU viruses reduced the number of infected cells. a recent structure revealed arbidol bound to H7 HA from influenza virus (88) it may be interesting to analyze the binding of arbidol to EBOV-GP. it mimics the Ebola virus at the level of cell entry and can be a valuable tool for the screening of antibodies and therapeutic drugs. Stained cells were bulk sorted with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. EBOV-GP was detected on >99% of the sorted cells. it was stable and uniform up to at least to the ninth passage after sorting. seed S-FLU virus per cell added to infect E-SIAT cells produced the highest titers of the E-S-FLU virus. a lower MOI (0.01) was adequate for seeding of HA-SIAT cells (12). seed S-FLU virus was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing the E-S-FLU or H5 S-FLU virus were titrated in 2-fold dilutions in VGM across a flat-bottom 96-well plate. MDCK-SIAT1 indicator cells were washed in PBS, and 3 104 cells in 100 l of VGM were added to each well and incubated for 18 h. fluorescence excitation was at 483 nm (bandwidth of 8 nm) and emission was at 515 nm (bandwidth of 8 nm) each well had 53 flashes at a 4-mm diameter and fluorescence readout from the top optic. each well had 53 flashes at a 4-mm diameter and fluorescence readout from the top optic, giving the orbital averaging value. a total of 1 105 wild-type, ex2 NPC1-KO, or ex4 NPC1-KO cells were seeded into a 24-well tissue culture plate in 500 l of D10 medium. before infection, the medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS. cells were infected with maximal doses of 1 106 CID50 of the E-S-FLU virus (MOI, 10 CID50/cell) or 8 107 CID50 of the medium was removed from the wells and cells were fixed with 100 l of 10% formalin (in PBS) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the formalin was replaced with 100 l of PBS. the plates were analyzed with a fluorescence plate reader (CLARIOstar) all small inhibitor molecules, including the LOPAC1280 library, were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich and stored in 10 mM dimethyl sulfoxide at 20\u00b0C. a total of 3 104 MDCK-SIAT1 cells were seeded in 50 l of VGM and preincubated with drugs for 3 h (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2) a falsely low eGFP fluorescence reading can be detected by visual inspection in a fluorescence microscope. plates were stained with WGA after cells were fixed and washed once with PBS. a 50-l volume of 5 g/ml WGA was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. cDNA encoding EBOV-GP from ebolavirus Makona wt/GIN/2014/Kissidougou-C15 was human codon optimized and synthesized by GeneArt. we transduced Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (21) with lentivirus to express full-length EBOV-GP. seed viruses coated in H5, H7, or H1 HA were titrated by TCID50. a relatively high MOI of approximately 1 TCID50 of seed S-FLU virus per cell added to infect E-SIAT cells produced the highest titers of the virus. a lower MOI was adequate for seeding of HA-SIAT cell lines (12). seed virus TCID50 was titrated for concentration of replication-competent clones. wells containing clones of eGFP-expressing S-FLU virus >4 standard deviations above 16 control wells were detected with a plate reader. the TCID50/ml was calculated by the Reed-Muench method (91). from the EC50 dilution and the number of cells per well (3 104), the CID50/ml was calculated as 2 106 in the E-S-FLU virus batch and 1.6 108 in the H5 S-FLU virus batch. all of the evaluation and screening was done with the Zaire (C15) E-S-FLU and H5-S-FLU viruses in parallel. a total of 1 105 wild-type, ex2 NPC1-KO, or ex4 NPC1-KO cells were seeded into a 24-well tissue culture plate in 500 l of D10 medium. before infection, cells were infected with maximum doses of 1 106 CID50 of the E-S-FLU virus. the assay was done as described by Powell et al. (12, 92), with minor modifications. the E-S-FLU (MOI, 4 CID50/cell) and H5-S-FLU (MOI, 4 CID50/cell) viruses were diluted in VGM to give plateau expression of eGFP in 3 104 MDCK-SIAT1 cells. overnight infection was allowed (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2) GP-lenti carries a firefly luciferase reporter gene. 3 104 MDCK-SIAT1 cells were seeded in 50 l of VGM. infection was quantified by measuring luciferase reporter expression. -S-FLU (MOI, 4 CID50/cell) virus diluted in VGM to give plateau expression of eGFP in 3 104 MDCK-SIAT1 cells was then added for overnight infection. cells were fixed with 100 l of 10% formalin (in PBS) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the formalin was replaced with 100 l of PBS, and the plates were analyzed with a fluorescence plate reader (CLARIOstar) as for the MN of the 2,635 molecules they tested, 538 were also found in the sigma LOPAC1280 library. we compared the inhibitory effects of these 538 compounds in both screenings. logP and pKa values were estimated on the basis of their chemical structures."}
