TOP10 E. coli cells were transformed with pBAD GII.4 RdRp plasmid. they were then cultured at 37\u00b0C until the OD600 was 0.6. cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer. ide (DMSO), 0.5 U/l RNaseIn (Promega, Madison, WI) and 100 nM HNV RdRp were quenched every 30 min. the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 96-well filter plate. the filters on the plate were air dried, and 40 l Microscint-20 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was added to each well. the reaction mixtures were incubated for 2.5 h at 30\u00b0C. each competing nucleotide was tested at a low (0.1 M) or high (100 M) concentration while other NTPs were kept at 0.1 M. RNA primers P5 (5\u2032-GUGAA), P6 (5\u2032-GUGAAU), P7 (5\u2032-GUGAAUG) and P8 (5\u2032-GUGAAUGA) were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc.

IC50s for 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP were 2.4 M and 2.7 M, respectively. IC50 fold shift was determined by dividing the IC50 of 2CM-CTP at a high NTP concentration (100 M) by the IC50 of 2CM-CTP at a low concentration (0.1 M) the same experiment as in panel A, but with T-705 RTP. [3H]UTP was used to measure the IC50 of 2CM-CTP with a high concentration of UTP. [3H]CTP was used to measure the IC50 of T-705 RTP with a high concentration of UTP. suramin has been reported to inhibit NoV polymerase (45) the same assay format was used to determine the inhibition efficacy of T-705 RTP against HNVpol. the inhibition effect of T-705 RTP was significantly reduced (IC50 = 24.7 0.9 M) ps. Mps and Gps contain mouse norovirus and human GII.4 subgenomic promoter and template sequences. the gel image shows the products from de novo initiation and primer extension, using Mps as the RNA template. the 11-nt RNA was the correctly initiated and terminated de novo initiation product generated from Mps. ucleotide incorporation assay was designed to measure the effects of 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP once they were incorporated into the growing RNA primer strand. ucleotide incorporation assay was designed to measure the effects of 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP once they were incorporated into the growing RNA primer strand. it was designed to measure the effects of 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP once they were incorporated into the growing a single-nucleotide incorporation assay was base specific. compared, adding T-705 RTP resulted in only 6% primer extension from 7-mer to 8-mer. 37% of the 8-mer was further converted to extended products up to 11-mer. single- or multiple-nucleotide/nucleotide analog incorporation using the 8-mer primer. Lanes 2, 4, and 6 to 9 indicate the one nucleotide/nucleotide analog added. water instead of a nucleotide was added in lane 1 as a negative control. the target selectivity of 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP was assessed by measuring their levels of incorporation by HMRP, an enzyme known to recognize antiviral ribonucleotide analogs (49). Adding the next correct nucleotide (UTP) resulted in almost 100% further primer extension (from 13- to 14-mer) for both ATP and T-705 RTP. both 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP were recognized as substrates for HMRP. only 2CM-CTP caused immediate chain termination of RNA synthesis. a molecule combining the ribose modification of 2CM-C with the base modification of T-705 might be less efficiently recognized by the human enzyme. -TP potently inhibited HNVpol RdRp activity, with an IC50 of 0.27 M. 2CM-T-1106-TP was also less efficiently recognized by HMRP. in comparison, 2CM-T-1106-TP inhibited HNVpol with an increased IC50 of 21.8 M. the antiviral efficacy of the nucleoside analog 2CM-C was evaluated in cells containing a stable subgenomic replicon of human noV. we measured the expression level of the NPT gene, a selectable marker carried by the noV replicon, which is dependent on the activity of the noV polymerase complex. we developed a cell-free radiometric assay designed to measure the competitive inhibition of HNVpol by nucleotide analogs. in this enzymatic assay, [3H]UTP was used as a tracer to monitor the time-dependent RdRp activity. the inhibition assay was validated with all four canonical 3\u2032 deoxynucleoside triphosphates used as chain terminators. time dependence of HNVpol RNA synthesis was fitted to a linear equation. time point measurements were taken every 30 min by quenching the 50-l reaction mixtures with 60 l cold 20% TCA containing 0.5 mM ATP. each data set was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. error bars indicate the standard deviation of the results from at least two independent experiments. the nucleotide competitive profile of 2CM-CTP was assessed by measuring the effect of varying the concentrations of natural NTPs on enzyme inhibition. high ATP, GTP, or UTP concentrations did not affect the IC50 of 2CM-CTP (Fig. 4A and C and Table 2). 05 RTP using either a low (0.1 M) or a high (100 M) concentration of ATP and GTP. error bars indicate the standard deviations of the results from two independent experiments. the fold shift was determined as the IC50 of the compound tested at a high NTP concentration (100 M) divided by the IC50 of the compound at a low NTP concentration (0.1 M) the values are the means SD of the results of two to five experiments. suramin and its analogs interact with the RNA binding pocket of noV polymerase. their mechanism of action is likely to be distinct from that of nucleotide analogs. we developed a single-nucleotide incorporation assay to study the interaction between the active site of noV and the two NTP analogs. a single- or multiple-nucleotide incorporation assay was designed to measure the effects of 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP once they were incorporated into the growing RNA primer strand. a single-nucleotide extension of a preassembled oligonucleotide primer using HNVpol was not sufficiently efficient for further study. pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of single-nucleotide incorporation was not suitable. the progress curves of single-nucleotide incorporation were studied. the product formation was linear up to 60 min, which was chosen as the end time point for our nucleotide incorporation study. adding T-705 RTP resulted in only 6% primer extension from 7-mer to 8-mer. 37% of the 8-mer was further converted to extended products up to 11-mer. the incorporation of T-705 RTP opposite template C was low but significant. the band intensities on the gel in panel B were analyzed. the percentages of primer extensions, 9-mer versus (8-mer plus 9-mer) for single-nucleotide incorporation and >9-mer versus >8-mer for multiple-nucleotide incorporation are shown. T-705 RTP and ribavirin-TP were not significantly recognized as cytidine analogs. however, T-705 RTP was efficiently recognized as a substrate using a primer-template sequence designed for adenosine analog incorporation. adding the next correct nucleotide caused almost 100% further primer extension (from 13- to 14-mer) for both ATP and T-705 RTP. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP displayed low levels of discrimination by HMRP. 2CM-T-1106-TP potently inhibited HNVpol RdRp activity. 2CM-T-1106-TP was also less efficiently recognized by HMRP. 2CM-T-1106-TP inhibited HNVpol, with an IC50 of 21.8 M. 2CM-T-1106-TP inhibited HNVpol, with an IC50 of 0.27 M. nitazoxanide has been used successfully to treat subjects suffering from noV gastroenteritis. the only two nucleoside analogs known to inhibit NoV replication are 2CM-C and T-705 (favipiravir) the only two nucleoside analogs known to inhibit noV replication are 2CM-C and T-705 (favipiravir) the antiviral effect of T-705 against human norovirus has never been tested. 2CM-CTP and T-705 RTP potently inhibited HNVpol. ribavirin was also less potent than 2CM-C and T-705. this result is consistent with a prior report of weak inhibition of ribavirin in the HNV replicon assay. a single-nucleotide incorporation assay was developed to measure the incorporation of T-705 RTP into RNA by noV polymerases. prior attempts to develop such an assay were unsuccessful (55), most likely due to the specific template sequence needed for productive enzyme-RNA interactions. we designed a primer-template substrate that mimics the promoter region of the MNV subgenome. the lack of immediate and complete chain termination observed with T-705 RTP is also consistent with previous reports for influenza A virus polymerase. ribavirin inhibits inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase and causes a significant decrease in the intracellular GTP pool. this antiviral effect is likely different from that of ribavirin. selective of viral RNA polymerases because it also interacted with HMRP. incorporation of 2CM-CTP by HMRP resulted in immediate chain termination. ambiguous base pairing and incorporation did not result in immediate chain termination of human mitochondrial RNA. molecular modeling of interactions between nucleotide analogs and the active site of norovirus polymerase may provide some guidance for the optimization of drug activity. understanding the precise mechanisms of action of anti-NoV compounds gives a rational basis for optimizing their inhibition potencies and selectivities."}
