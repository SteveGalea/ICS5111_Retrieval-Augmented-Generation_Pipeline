{"summary": "adenovirus, coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) the population in this study was not only largely asymptomatic but also specifically ambulatory. families recruited from the university of Utah campus community found that 47% of respiratory infections among adults were asymptomatic. influenza virus, hMPV, coV HKU1, and hMPV were more frequently associated with symptoms (4). asymptomatic infection rates may vary as a function of host age and virus. studies defined asymptomatic patients as those free from symptoms at the time of study participation or within a window around the time of enrollment. this wide variation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic presentations underscores the need for further studies to understand the distribution of symptoms across infection statuses. 69.5% identified as white, 3.5% as black/African American, 13.2% as Asian, 1.5% as American Indian/Alaskan Native, 6.8% as other or of two or more races. 21.7% identified as Hispanic, while 77.8% did not. a total of 39.8% of participants were in the 18-to-29-year-old age range. all 2,685 participants across both seasons tested positive for respiratory virus. 168 (6.2%) individuals tested positive for respiratory virus. 85 (50.6%) were positive for HRV, 65 (38.7%) for CoV, and 18 (10.2%) for adenovirus, hMPV, RSV, influenza virus, or PIV. in the summer arm, only 5.6% of participants tested positive (2), whereas in the winter arm, 7.0% did. the majority of infections in the summer arm were HRV infections (71.0%) 48.1% of positives being symptomatic during the summer arm. 4.8% to 30.1% being symptomatic for the winter arm. there was no evidence of differences for any other definition. the best-fit model supported an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection (all viruses) with a higher total symptom score but with no other variables. for all participants combined across seasons, the best-fit model supported an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection (all viruses) the best-fit model indicated an association between positivity and symptom score for both seasonal arms. for the summer arm and winter arm considered individually, the association held only for symptom score and being Hispanic. e models are presented for positivity for any virus, human rhinovirus (HRV) only, and coronavirus (CoV) only. signal intensity (measured continuously in nanoamps per square millimeter) was positively associated with reporting allergies (P 0.05) there were differences between the seasonal arms for this finding, however. participants aged 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, and 50 to 64 years had lower total reported symptom scores than participants aged 18 to 29 years (ANOVA P 0.001) these results were consistent and significant across the seasonal arms. reporting consumption of cold and flu medicines was positively associated with higher total symptom scores across all participants and also only among positives. 0.8 0.5 0.4

tendency to get sick and total self-reported symptom scores among all participants. a total of 39.8% of participants were in the 18-to-29 age range, 20.9% were 30 to 39 years of age, 22.0% were 40 to 49 years of age, 12% were 50 to 64 years of age, and 4.2% were 65 or older. 3.4% reported strongly agreed, 11.3% somewhat agreed, 13.5% neither agreed nor disagreed, and 48.8% strongly disagreed. all 2,685 participants across both seasons tested positive for respiratory virus. 85 (50.6%) were positive for HRV, 65 (38.7%) for CoV, and 18 (10.2%) for adenovirus, hMPV, RSV, influenza virus, or PIV. only 5.6% of participants tested positive (2), whereas in the winter arm 7.0% did. these positivity results did show differences across seasons in terms of virus distribution. the majority of infections in the summer arm were HRV infections (71.0%). positive-testing participants were more likely to meet symptomatic criteria. the association was consistent across the seasonal arms. no other univariate associations between testing positive for respiratory virus and other collected characteristics were found. best-fit model showed an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection (all viruses) with a higher total symptom score but with no other variables. for all participants combined across seasons, the best-fit model supported an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection with a higher total symptom score. the best-fit model indicated an association between positivity and symptom score for both seasonal arms. for the summer arm and winter arm considered individually, the association held only for symptom score and being Hispanic. intensity was positively associated with reporting allergies (P 0.05) for the winter arm, allergies were similarly associated with quantitated score of signal intensity for all positives. there was an association of signal intensity with age but not with allergies for the summer arm. consumption of cold and flu medicines was positively associated with higher total symptom scores across all participants and also only among positives (ANOVA P 0.0001) there were no differences seen in assessing only the participants testing positive (AOV, P = 0.725) there were, however, differences in mean individual symptom scores by virus as shown in Table 4. the proportions of symptomatic individuals (by the various definitions) who tested negative were quite high (66.7% to 86.9%), and this finding held across the seasonal arms. the association between having allergies and being symptomatic among participants who tested negative was less strong for definition 2 (P 0.05) 25.9%, 32.8%, and 29.6% of infected individuals reported no symptoms at all (symptom score of zero) for the summer arm, the winter arm, and the entire study, respectively, 25.9%, 32.8%, and 29.6% of individuals testing positive reported no symptoms at all. a substantial percentage of individuals who were symptomatic across the definitions did not test positive. this association could have manifested from selection bias represented by individuals who chose to participate in the study. manufacturers specifications indicate that there is no association between eSensor signal intensity and the amount of virus present in a sample. however, some association between signal intensity and having allergies among all positives combined from both study arms. the study was run over two seasons, but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season. the findings indicate a significant level of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory adult population across seasons, as well as a substantial proportion of infections that are asymptomatic. shedding prior to symptom development also occurs (19). participants were given a baseline survey, and one nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each nostril. the severity level for each symptom was recorded on a Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe; scored at 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively) nucleic acids were extracted from 200-l samples using an easyMAG NucliSENS system. positive samples were identified using a threshold of 25 nA/mm2. there is no standard definition of symptomatic infections. chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests used chi-square and chi-square to compare differences across each categorical variable with respect to positivity. logistic regression was used to conduct a similar analysis on associations between the demographic variables and positivity as a binary variable (positive versus negative) for all viruses and for HRV and CoV separately. the samples were jointly stored in 2 ml DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) for up to 30 days at 4 to 25\u00b0C. the samples were then divided into 2 aliquots and stored at 80\u00b0C until assay. definition 6 required moderate to severe fever and mild to severe cough or sore throat. definition 7 required mild to severe fever and moderate to severe cough or sore throat. chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests to compare differences across each categorical variable."}
