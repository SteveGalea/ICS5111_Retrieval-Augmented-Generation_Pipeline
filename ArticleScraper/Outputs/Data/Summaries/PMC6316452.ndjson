{"summary": "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, recently emerged coronaviruses responsible for Middle East (MERS-CoV) and severe acute (SARS-CoV) respiratory syndromes. chronic pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may have an infectious viral component to their onset and/or pathogenesis. murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) infects the lungs of wild and laboratory mice. MHV-68 infects alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. lungs of mice infected by the virus exhibit discernable pathology. the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is thought to be involved in the host response to respiratory infections. IL6 is upregulated in ARDS caused by bacterial pneumonias in human patients [28] and in LPS-treated human lung cells infected with RSV [29]. cytokine profiles, nor cytotoxic T-cell responses were observed in MHV-68 infection. multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) allows for the identification of differentially-expressed proteins secreted or released via pathological processes into the alveolar lumen. these studies have begun to add a new dimension into the characterization of human or mouse physiological responses to acute lung injury (ALI) [33], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35,36], and diffuse interstitial lung diseases including IPF [37], COPD [38], and oxidative or toxicological damage to the lung the experimental protocol herein demonstrates the feasibility of differential BAL proteomics to characterize less abundant, highly regulated host factors in BAL fluid. MHV-68, MHV68/IL6 and red fluorescent protein (RFP)/MHV-68 viruses in this study were all titered by plaque overlay assay on BHK21 cells as previously described. murine NIH3T3 or human A549 cells were infected with RFP/MHV-68 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 1 or 5 and at 4 h or 20 h post-infection (h.p.i.) cells were rinsed in cold 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 5 min in the dark in 1 PBS containing 5 M 5/6-carboxy-2\u2032, mice were anesthetized with 0.1 mL (100 mg/kg) ketamine by intraperitoneal injection, then inoculated with 20 L DMEM (6 mice) or infected intranasally (i.n.) 3 mice in each experimental group were housed separately until sacrifice at 6 or 9 d.p.i., when at each timepoint, 3 mice in each experimental group were housed until sacrifice at 6 or 9 d.p.i. fluid was centrifuged immediately (2000 g, 15 min., 4 \u00b0C) to separate soluble, supernatant phases. cell pellets were resuspended in 50 L 0.5% FBS DMEM containing 1 mM EDTA. monocytes in 5 L aliquots were counted by trypan blue exclusion test. a Bradford assay was used to quantify protein concentration prior to and post-processing. SDS-PAGE with SYPRO-Ruby staining was used to observe depletion of abundant albumin bands. aliquots of 25 L were subjected to Sircol assay. RT-PCR for quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from mouse lungs 7 d.p.i. and reverse transcribed into cDNA as described [47,49]. PCR For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from mouse lungs 7 d.p.i. and reverse transcribed into cDNA as described. two-dimensional gels were briefly incubated in 10% methanol/5% acetic acid. gels were rinsed in ddH2O and stained for 3 h with SYPRO-Ruby. proteins resolved in the pH 4\u20137 range were sufficiently separated for spot mapping across gels using an integrated PD Quest 7.1 imager and software. peptide and fragment a-, b- and y-series ions spectra were captured on an AB Sciex Qstar quadrapole XL hybrid TOF LC/MS-MS. peptide tolerance set at 0.5 Da, MS/MS tolerance 0.8 Da, charge states + 1/ + 2/ + 3/ + 4, 1 tryptic digest miss allowed, oxidation of Cys and Met. MALDI peptide data were searched against the mouse proteome using Aldente software. predicted pI and molecular mass data were estimated from 2D-PAGE spots. IPA categories were tested for significance by a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg test for false discovery. a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter\u2013enhancer inserted a cDNA encoding RFP into an intergenic locus near the 5\u2032 end of the MHV-68 genome. the ORF28 gene is dispensable for infection of cultured cells and Mus musculus models of MHV-68 infection. NIH3T3 cells were infected with MHV-68 (m.o.i. = 0.25) in absence of 1 mM soluble glutathione (GSH) or 2\u201325 M paraquat in media. after 20 h, culture supernatants were diluted 1/2, 1/10, or 1/100, used to re-infect fresh NIH3T3 cells. 3 mice in each experimental group were anesthetized and sacrificed under anesthesia by i.p. injection of 0.1 mL ketamine. 2 more mice in the DMEM and in each infected group were sacrificed at 7 d.p.i. fluid supernatants were used for sircol collagen assay, viral DNA detection by quantitative PCR, and protein detection by Western blotting. the remaining 2 BAL fluid supernatants were pooled for each experimental condition, precipitated in 95% acetone for 2 h. aliquots of 25 L were subjected to Sircol assay. collagen concentration was determined by absorbance at 540 nm. lysates were subjected to a catalase activity assay. IEF, 2D-PAGE, Spot Mapping and Densitometry Eluted BAL proteins (300 L) were resuspended in IEF buffer containing ampholytes covering the pH 3\u201310 range. samples passively loaded on rehydrated, immobilized 11 cm nonlinear pH 3\u201310 gradient IPG strips (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and then focused by pI for 18 h ramping over 6 h 89 abundant differential spots were excised and in-gel digested in trypsin gold MS (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) alkylated peptides were extracted, dried and stored at 80 \u00b0C. aliquots of peptide digests were mixed with 200 proportion of -cyano FHSA matrix dissolved in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. for MALDI-TOF, aliquots of peptide digests were mixed with 200 proportion of -cyano FHSA matrix dissolved in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. mice were inoculated intranasally with DMEM, or infected with a high titer of MHV-68 or a recombinant MHV-68 virus co-expressing murine interleukin-6 (IL6) from a constitutive promoter. at six d.p.i. and nine d.p.i., BAL fluid was collected and analyzed for cells, protein, soluble collagen, and viral DNA content. both protein concentration and mononuclear cellularity in BAL fluid were substantially higher in infected vs. uninfected mice at nine d.p.i.
