{"summary": "eukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs are modified by the addition of a polyadenine tail at the 3\u2032- terminal and a cap structure at the 5\u2032-terminal. the RNA cap is made of an N7-methylated guanine nucleotide connected through a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge to the first transcribed nucleotide, generally an adenine. RNA viruses often deviate from the paradigmic eukaryotic mRNA capping scheme. alphaviruses methylate GTP onto the N7-guanine before the presumed attachment of 7MeGMP to the nascent viral 5\u2032-diphosphate mRNA[6]. in the case of single-stranded negative-sense (-)RNA viruses, the L polymerase attaches GDP rather than GMP to a nas nsp10 interacts with nsp16, conferring 2\u2032-O-MTase activity to nsp16. nsp10 is a double zinc finger protein of 148 residues whose crystal structure is known[20], [21]. nsp10 has been found to be essential in the assembly of a functional replication/transcription complex[22] -dependent MTases share little sequence identity, 2\u2032O-MTases exhibit a KDKE catalytic tetrad and a very conserved folding made of a seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by one to three helices on each side[25]. the SAM binding site general location is conserved, suggesting evolutionary pressure on the MTase fold has maintained the same SAM-binding region while accommodating the versatile chemistry of the methyltransfer reaction turreted orbivirus bluetongue virus VP4 protein at 2.5 resolution[30] revealed a three-domain protein, with a \u201chead\u201d guanylyltransferase domain, a central N7-guanine MTase, and a \u201cbottom\u201d 2\u2032-O-MTase domain. the flavivirus N-terminus domain (residues 1\u2013265) of the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA zinc finger protein nsp10 activates nsp16-mediated 2\u2032-O-MTase. nsp10 acted as an activator of nsp16-mediated 2\u2032-O-MTase. nsp10 acted as a scaffold for nsp16. Nsp16 was well defined by its electron density except for two flexible loops (residues 19\u201335 and 135\u2013137) with high B factors and weak or missing electron density. these loops are solvent-exposed at each side of the putative RNA-binding groove. nsp10/16 heterodimer can be conveniently viewed as nsp16 sitting on top of a nsp10 monomer. the nsp10 overall structure in the complex remains unchanged relative to published structures of nsp10 alone. the average RMSD is about 0.77 in 118 residues. one metal ion (blue sphere) is found in nsp16 on the opposite face from the active site to which a SAH molecule is found (red sticks) each secondary structure element is labeled according to[25]. nsp16 adopts a canonical SAM-MT fold as defined initially for the catechol O-MTase[25] the missing helix B and helix C are indicated by dashed ovals. the approximate general binding site of nsp10 is shown (yellow oval) neither SAM nor SAH was added to the purification or crystallization buffer. SAH modeled in a simulated annealing Omit map contoured at 1. carbons, oxygens, sulfur, and nitrogens are in grey, red, yellow, and blue sticks. carbons, oxygens, sulfur, and nitrogens are in grey, red, yellow, and blue sticks. nsp10/nsp16 complex formation as determined using pull-down experiments, SDS-PAGE analysis, and quantitation. nsp10/nsp16 complex formation as determined using alanine. the % of MTase activity was determined using filter binding assays relative to wild-type. nsp10/nsp16 MTase activity requires Mg2+. a peak of electron density presumably corresponding to Mg2+ is localized onto nsp16. the putative ion (blue sphere) is shown solvated in its first atomic shell by six water molecules (red spheres) the corresponding 2Fo-Fc electron density map (contoured 1) with a cross shape is shown in purple. Residues of Nsp16 involved in coordination of Mg2+ ion via water molecules are labeled. cap analogues (m7GpppA, GpppA, m7GpppG, GpppG) and short capped RNA substrates (m7GpppA(C)n) could neither be co-crystallized with nsp10/nsp16 nor bound onto preformed nsp10/nsp16 crystals. however, the atomic coordinates of the N7-methyl guanine RNA oligomer Y132 is located in the vicinity of a highly mobile loop (residues 135-138) not always visible in our crystal structures suggesting that this loop may move in order to wrap the triphosphate moiety of the RNA cap and/or the RNA cap itself. interface of the Heterodimer All nsp10 secondary structure elements but helices 2 and 5 contact nsp16. the nsp10 contact points can be viewed as 5 small patches A to E. in total, the interface involves 53 residues, 23 and 30 from nsp10 and nsp16, respectively. nsp16 residues defining patch I, II, III, and IV are rendered as sticks. nsp10 residues defining patch A, B, C, D, and E are rendered as sticks. nsp10 residues defining patch A, B, C, D, and E are rendered as sticks. lalanine (Y96F) increases interaction and MTase activity[18]. the absence of the hydroxyl group does not alter the topology of the interface. the absence of the hydroxyl group does not alter the topology of the interface. mutants in patches II, III and IV completely disrupt the nsp10/nsp16 complex and annihilate nsp16 MTase activity. mutations in the nsp10/nsp16 interface may alter the fine positioning of catalytic residues without any significant effect on nsp10 binding. purified nsp16 exhibits 2\u2032-O-MTase activity only when complemented with SARS-CoV nsp10. co-expression of nsp10 and nsp16 using a bi-cistronic prokaryotic expression vector facilitated affinity chromatography purification and crystallization of the complex[16], [17], [18]. the nsp10/16 Heterodimer can be conveniently viewed as nsp16 sitting on top of a nsp10 monomer. the nsp10 overall structure in the complex remains unchanged relative to published structures of nsp10 alone. the average RMSD is about 0.77 in 118 residues (PDB codes 2FYG, 2G9T and 2GA6[20], [21]). this indicates that neither significant conformational change nor surface modification occurs in nsp10 when binding to nsp16. nsp16 topology matches those of dengue virus NS5 N-terminal domain. nsp16 lacks several elements of the canonical MTase fold. helices B and C are indicated by dashed ovals. all the residues involved in SAM/SAH binding are absolutely conserved in coronavirus np16s. binding specificity for SAM/SAH is achieved by holding distal SAM/SAH carboxylic and amino groups through five hydrogen bonds. ribose moiety is held by three hydrogen bonds involving Y132, G73, and D99. alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad almost completely block 2\u2032-O-MTase activity without jeopardizing binding to nsp10. alanine substitutions almost completely block 2\u2032-O-MTase activity without jeopardizing binding to nsp10. alanine substitutions almost completely block 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. nsp10/nsp16 complex formation determined using filter binding assays. nsp10/nsp16 MTase activity requires Mg2+. in enzyme activity assays, the ion can be substituted by Mn2+. peak of electron density presumably corresponding to Mg2+ is localized onto nsp16, distant from the SAH-binding cavity. Binding via water molecules involves T58 and S188 side chain hydroxyls and the main chain carbonyl of E276. the cation may thus hold these elements together. nsp10/nsp16 complex absolutely requires an N7-methyl guanine capped RNA substrate to exhibit MTase activity[16]. the structural basis for the preferential binding to methylated N7-guanine versus non-methylated caps has been elucidated in four cases. the presence of the methyl group greatly enhances - stacking. the VP39 RNA was a reasonably good fit into an nsp16 hydrophobic groove radiating from the catalytic site. we note that the protein side diametrically opposite to the proposed hydrophobic RNA binding groove is highly positively charged. this observation may account for the difficulty of achieving experimental RNA binding in the proposed RNA binding site. nsp16 and nsp10 are rendered as a solvent-accessible surface colored grey and wheat respectively. nsp16 and nsp10 are rendered as a solvent-accessible surface colored grey and wheat respectively. position of Y30 and Y132 are indicated. the interface of the heterodimer involves 53 residues, 23 and 30 from nsp10 and nsp16, respectively. in nsp10, a single residue (Asn10, at the edge of the interaction surface) is not conserved out of 23 (4.3 %), whereas in nsp16 there are 8 non-conserved residues out of 30 (26.7 %) the crystal structure indicates that the nsp10 interface proposed by Lugari et al. [18] is a correct and conservative estimation, as the interface also includes L45 belonging to patch A. we also confirm the positive co-relation of the detected nsp10/nsp16 interaction with MTase activity. nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 differs from wild-type nsp10/nsp16 in the SAH binding site, though. the MTase inhibition pattern by SAH was identical for wild-type and nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 (not shown) mutations in the nsp10/nsp16 interface may alter the fine positioning of catalytic residues without any significant effect on nsp10 binding. most of these mutants are localized in patch I which contains the K46 catalytic residue. patch II and III mutants tend to have more mitigated phenotypes. nsp16 structures, and the K46 -amino group match spatially those of the vaccinia virus VP39 2\u2032-O-MTase[47]. at the initial stage of the reaction the 2\u2032-hydroxyl of the capped RNA substrate would occupy the position of the water molecule. in VP39, K175 has been identified as the general base catalyst[47]. nsp16 complex is assembled through a 890 2 contact surface in nsp16. nsp10/nsp16 complex is essentially identical to that of uncomplexed nsp10 crystallized alone by others[20], [21]. it is therefore reasonable to see heterodimer as non-permanent species. nsp10(Q65E) mutant provides a temperature-sensitive phenotype[22], [23] does not map in the nsp10/nsp16 interface, confirming that nsp10 has a pleotropic role. nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 complex is more stable and more active than the wild-type heterodimer. the nsp10 residue at position 96 is a phenylalanine. it would be interesting to determine whether this polymorphism is relevant to the SARS-CoV pathogenicity at any (direct or indirect) level. a minimal level of 2\u2032-O-MTase activity would be expected to be critical to virus survival. nsp10/nsp16 is only active as n7-guanine methylated capped RNA. nsp14-mediated n7-guanine methylation precedes nsp10/nsp16 RNA 2\u2032-O methylation[16]. nsp16-mediated nsp14-mediated nsp14-mediated RNA methylation precedes nsp10/nsp16 RNA we have crystallized the inhibitor Sinefungin with the nsp10/nsp16 complex. it exhibits an IC50 of 0.74 M, 16-fold lower than that of SAH. analysis suggests a likely mechanism of action that also accounts for the observed inhibitory effect of this drug. p16 crystal structure shows that nsp16 adopts a typical fold of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase family as defined initially for the catechol O-MTase[25]. a good alignment (170\u00b0) is found between the SAH sulfur atom, a water molecule present in both SAH- and sinefungin-bound nsp16 structures, and the K46 -amino group. the nsp10/nsp16 enzyme requires a divalent cation, either magnesium, manganese or calcium. this cation is coordinated through water molecules by three residues located on three distinct structural elements. it is thus possible that one divalent cation, presumably Mg2+, plays a structural role in holding these three nsp16 structural elements together. the nsp10 surface in the nsp10/nsp16 complex is identical to that of uncomplexed nsp10 crystallized alone by others[20], [21]. it is therefore reasonable to see this heterodimer as a non-permanent species which would tolerate nsp10 engaging in interactions with other partners[17], [19]. the nsp10 mutant providing a temperature-sensitive phenotype does not map in the the nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 complex is more stable and more active than the wild-type heterodimer. this is yet another observation hinting at the involvement of nsp10 in protein-protein interactions networks including other partners than nsp16, such as nsp5 and nsp14[17], [19] nsp10/nsp16 is only active as n7-guanine methylated capped RNA. nsp14-mediated n7-guanine methylation precedes nsp10/nsp16 RNA 2\u2032-O methylation. a comparison of nsp16 and VP39 electrostatic surfaces reveals the putative RNA-binding. nsp16/nsp10 crystallized the inhibitor Sinefungin with the nsp10/nsp16 complex. the adenine nucleobase does not fit snugly into its binding pocket. this suggests a possible breach to achieve anti-coronavirus selectivity with a small molecule inhibitor. the purification and crystallogenesis of the nsp10/nsp16 complex was performed as described in [40]. Typical crystals of the wild-type nsp10/nsp16 appear in hanging drops after 24 h at 20\u00b0C in 0.1 M CHES pH 9, 1.52 M MgCl2 hexahydrate. phases calculated from this partial model were combined with SAD phases from the Zn atoms using PHASER. phases were improved with PARROT[55] to ameliorate the resulting low quality map. the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure is derived from the analysis of the structure of the vaccinia virus methyltransferase VP39 crystallized in complex with a capped RNA and a S-Adenosylhomocysteine[47] (SAH) the two structures are manually aligned using COOT[58] based on the position of SAH binding sites, as well as SAH, and Sinefungin (SF mutants were cloned into a gateway modified dual-promotor expression plasmid. nsp10 encodes a protein in fusion with a N-terminal strep tag. nsp16 is expressed under a T7 promoter and encodes a protein in fusion with a N-terminal strep tag. the cells were pellets, frozen and resuspended in lysis buffer. they were supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 40 mM imidazole, 10 g/ml DNase I, and 0.5% Triton X-100. the standard assay, nsp10 and nsp16 were added at final concentrations of 600 nM, and 200 nM respectively. the amount of 3H-CH3 transferred onto 7MeGpppAC5 substrates was determined by filter binding assay as previously described. the purification and crystallogenesis of the nsp10/nsp16 complex was performed as described in [40] soaking was performed in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM SAH or Sinefungin during 24 h. strong peaks in both the residual and anomalous Fourier maps confirmed the presence of two Zinc ions at the expected positions within the nsp10 protein. the coordinates of the wild-type/SAH, mutant, and wild-type/Sinefungin structures have been deposited at the Protein Data bank. the modeling of the RNA cap structure in the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure is derived from the analysis of the structure of the vaccinia virus VP39 crystallized in complex with a capped RNA and a S-Adenosylhomocysteine[47] (sAH) nsp10 and nsp16-coding sequences were amplified by RT-PCR from the genome of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1. mutants were cloned into a gateway modified dual-promotor expression plasmid. nsp16 encodes a protein in fusion with a N-terminal strep tag. the expression of strep-tagged nsp10 or 6His-tagged nsp16 mutants was induced (DO600 = 0.6) by adding 50 M IPTG and 200 g/L of anhydrotetracycline. after an incubation for a 16 h at 24\u00b0C, the cell were pellets, frozen and resuspended in lysis buffer. short capped RNAs (7MeGpppAC5 or GpppAC5) were synthesized in vitro using bacteriophage T7 DNA primase. in the standard assay, nsp10 and nsp16 were added at final concentrations of 600 nM, and 200 nM, respectively. resulting alignment was converted using the ESPript program. transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (PTGC), NP_840013; TGEV, NP_839969; Bat coronavirus 512/2005 (BATC), YP_001351683; human coronavirus NL63 (NL63), AAS58176; mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MA59), NP_740613;. human enteric coronavirus 4408 (4408), ACJ3548 the nsp16 residues are green sticks, the SAH is represented in red sticks, and Sinefungin and water molecules are in sticks and spheres as in Fig. 3 respectively. the nsp16 residues are green sticks, the SAH is represented in red sticks, and Sinefungin and water molecules are in sticks and spheres as in Fig. 3. the interaction of each nsp10 or nsp16 mutant was determined using strep-tactin pull-down experiments of strep-tagged nsp10 co-expressed with nsp16. the % of MTase activity was determined using filter binding assays relative to wild-type."}
