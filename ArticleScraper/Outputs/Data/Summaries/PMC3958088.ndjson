{"summary": "virions are formed by a nonenveloped protein capsid and a positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 6.8 kb (3). a recent isolate was associated with encephalitis in an immunodeficient patient. atypical HAstV infection appears to be restricted to epithelial enteric cells. atypical HAstV may infect different cell types in vivo. a limited number of cell lines have been shown to be permissive to all HAstV serotypes. HAstV-8 enters Caco-2 cells using a clathrin-dependent pathway. it most likely needs to travel to late endosomes to reach the cytoplasm. the virus was activated with 200 mg/ml of trypsin for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. stocks of rotavirus strain RRV (kindly donated by H. B. Greenberg, Stanford University) and reovirus type 1 (kindly donated by C. Ramos, National Institute of Health, Cuernavaca, Mexico) were used as controls; they were propagated and the titers were determined in Caco-2 cells by an immunoperoxidase assay with the appropriate primary antibodies. ice-cold trypsin-activated virus was added to Caco-2 cells at an MOI of 0.1. the cells were maintained in an ice-cold water bath to prevent virus entry. after two additional washes with ice-cold minimal essential medium, warm MEM was added. HAstV-8 (at an MOI of 0.1) was added to Caco-2 cells and incubated at 4\u00b0C for the indicated times. the unbound virus was removed, the cells were washed twice, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. a mixture of activated virus and 10 M alpha-sarcin was added to Caco-2 cells and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were washed, lysed, and analyzed by radioactive incorporation in trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable material. the cells were fixed and stained with an anti-HAstV-8 antiserum. none of these treatments caused cell death, as determined by a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. transfected cells were transfected with 1.5 to 2 g of plasmid per well in 12-well plates using transfast transfection reagent. expression of these proteins was monitored by direct fluorescence observation (for Eps15 mutants) or by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor-488 as secondary antibodies. cells were cultured for 3 to 4 days at 37\u00b0C with advanced D-MEM. they were then seeded on 48-well tissue culture plates. the cells were infected at an MOI of 3 and processed for IF or harvested for protein analysis. mouse monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-tubulin antibody was from Zymed (San Francisco, CA), mouse anti-Rab7 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). mouse monoclonal antibody to clathrin heavy chain was purchased from ABR Antibodies (Golden, CO). ice-cold trypsin-activated virus was added to Caco-2 cells at an MOI of 0.1. the cells were maintained in an ice-cold water bath to prevent virus entry. after two additional washes, warm MEM was added and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. psin-treated HAstV-8 was added to Caco-2 cells and incubated at 4\u00b0C for the indicated times. the unbound virus was removed, the cells were washed twice, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. titers of virus stocks were determined either in the dark or under white light. a mixture of activated virus and 10 M alpha-sarcin was added to Caco-2 cells and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 3 to 4 days until they reached 100% confluence. the effects of drugs on viral infectivity are reported as the percentages of infected cells observed in the absence of any treatment. the effects of drugs on viral infectivity are reported as the percentages of infected cells observed in the absence of any treatment. dyn2 constructs were infected with HAstV (at an MOI of 3) and were detected by IF using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HAstV-8 and a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 568. bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1% [wt/vol]) in PBS was used as a blocking buffer. after 3 days at 37\u00b0C, the cells were infected at an MOI of 3. they were processed for IF or harvested for protein analysis. RESULTS astrovirus binding to cells is determined by physical methods. HAstV-8 had a half-time of attachment of 9.24 min. RNA release. this method has been used to evaluate the decapsidation of genomic RNA from different single-stranded positive-RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. this method has been used to evaluate the decapsidation of genomic RNA from different single-stranded positive-RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. alpha-sarcin is a small toxin with RNase activity to which the cell membrane is not permeable. the toxin enters the cell and degrades cellular RNA, blocking protein translation. astrovirus induces coentry of alpha-sarcin into Caco-2 cells. HAstV-8 or rotavirus (RRV) at an MOI of 10 in the presence (+) or absence () of 10 M alpha-sarcin for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE. cells were infected and incubated with alpha-sarcin as for panel A. in polymerization, 40; and bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1), which specifically inhibits the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), preventing the acidification of endocytic vesicles and the maturation of endosomes and lysosomes (41). HAstV infectivity was also impaired in cells treated with MBC, which removes cholesterol from cell membranes (42). astrovirus was determined by staining infected cells with an anti-capsid antibody. no difference was found between the two antibodies, confirming that the drug treatments affect virus entry and not the synthesis of the sgRNA. this results suggest that HAstV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and depends on the presence of cholesterol in the cell membrane, the actin cytoskeleton, and the acidification of endosomes. caco-2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and 72 h posttransfection, were infected with HAstV-8. at 10 h p.i., the cells were processed for IF using anti-HAstV-8 and anti-clathrin antibodies. arrows indicate cellular proteins that were nonspecifically recognized by the primary antibody. Dyn2, a GTPase that participates in the excision of endosomes from the plasma membrane (45) and Eps15, one of the adaptor proteins that interact with clathrin during endocytosis, have been involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of some molecules and viruses. the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding DN mutants of Eps15 (E95/295) and Dyn2 ( cells were transfected with the indicated constructs as described under Materials and Methods. cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-HA (green; to detect the expression of Dyn2) and with anti-HAstV-8 (red) antibodies. at least 300 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were screened for HAstV-8 infection. HAstV-8 infectivity is reduced in Rab7 knockdown cells. expression of siRNA-Rab7 and viral protease (V-Pro) was monitored with antibodies specific for the capsid protein VP90. arrows indicate cellular proteins recognized nonspecifically by the primary antibodies. the binding kinetics of astrovirus was determined using an assay. the assay measures the binding of infectious rather than physical particles. astrovirus was added to cells and incubated in an ice water bath to prevent virus entry. the infectivity of NR-HAstV was reduced 2 log units by white-light irradiation compared to conditions where the virus was kept in the dark. astrovirus induces the coentry of alpha-sarcin. cell infection with a variety of nonenveloped viruses induces the coentry of alpha-sarcin. protein synthesis was reduced in cells infected with HAstV. decreased incorporation of [35S]Met was dependent on trypsin treatment. simian rotavirus RRV treated with trypsin treated with trypsin. virus infection was evaluated on cells treated with different drugs. drugs included those that block clathrin assembly, cytoskeleton integrity, and endosome acidification. reovirus type 1 was used as a control (37, 38) caco-2 cells grown in 96-well plates were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of drugs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then infected with HastV-8 (black bars), or reovirus (white bars), maintaining the drugs during the adsorption period of 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the virus inoculum was then removed, and the infection was left to proceed for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. immunoblot analysis showed that transfection of Caco-2 cells with siRNA-CHC significantly reduced the levels of both CHC and astrovirus VP90 compared to the expression of these proteins in HAstV-infected cells transfected with siRNA-Irr. if the expression of clathrin was silenced, the infectivity of HAstV was reduced by about 50%. infectivity was determined by counting infected cells in cultures transfected with the indicated siRNAs. the data are expressed as percentages of the virus infectivity observed in cells treated with the irrelevant siRNA (Irr) a significant reduction in the number of infected cells was observed after transfection with the DN mutants. infectivity was reduced from 67 to 33% when cells were transfected with the Dyn-K44A DN mutant. a clathrin-, Dyn2-, and Eps15-dependent endocytosis pathway seems to be important for HAstV entry into Caco-2 cells. arithmetic means and standard deviation of three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. the images were obtained by confocal microscopy with slices of 0.2 m. Role of Rab7 in astrovirus infection. the negative effect of Baf-A1 on HAstV infection and the time needed for virus penetration/RNA decapsidation suggest that astrovirus might need to reach late endosomes for cell entry. protease (V-Pro) was monitored with the indicated antibodies. at 10 h p.i., the cells were fixed and stained by an immunoperoxidase assay. the data are expressed as percentages of the virus infectivity observed in cells treated with the irrelevant siRNA. infectivity assays performed in presence of inhibitors that affect endosome maturation, as well as different types of endocytosis and vesicular transport, such as Baf-A1, support this idea. it seems that HAstV uses a clathrin-dependent pathway to enter the cell, since its infectivity was reduced by silencing the expression of CHC and by overexpression of DN mutants. cholesterol has been considered more important for caveola- than for clathrin-dependent endocytosis (23, 51), but different reports have demonstrated that the lipid is important for viruses that use different mechanisms for cell entry. the entry of nonenveloped viruses depends on conformational changes of their capsid proteins that can be triggered by different factors. it would be expected that membrane permeabilization would be induced at the endosomal membrane, where virus entry occurs. the precise subcellular compartment where the virion or viral RNA and alpha-sarcin are translocated to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in the first 15 min after virus attachment is apparently necessary for HAstV-1 infection (61) stroviruses to infect target cells in natural infection."}
