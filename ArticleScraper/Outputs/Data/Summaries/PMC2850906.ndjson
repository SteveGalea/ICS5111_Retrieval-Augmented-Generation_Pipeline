{"summary": "Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the first line of defense against pandemic influenza. they dampen virus spread by reducing contact between infected and susceptible persons. they must be applied judiciously because they curtail essential societal activities. the current swine flu caused by a novel virus has infected a documented 182,166 humans, killing 1,799 from April 2009 to August 2009. if the virus mutates and achieves the ability to cause severe illness, it will kill more people and overwhelm the health system. if the virus mutates and achieves the ability to cause severe illness, it will kill more people. During the current H1N1 outbreak, infection control is recommended to prevent spread of the virus among humans. the sIR model has been used to study pandemic flu [11,12,16-25], seasonal flu [26-28], SARS [13,29-31], and smallpox [32-35]. Morton and Wickwire [40] developed optimal control policies for immunization assuming an infinite pandemic terminal time. but their switching curve derivation has an error in the derivatives (Eqs. 7a and 7b of [40] and thus their results are unclear. underlying assumptions of currently published results are questionable. Figure 1 expands the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Death model. boxes represent compartments and arcs represent flux between compartments. Figure 1 expands the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model to capture the mortality. i 0, s + i 1 state space 1 = (s, i), u* = 0 state space where u* = 0 proportion of the control space HJB Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation 1 = (s, i), u* = 0 state space where u* = 0 proportion of the control space. the cost c is a weight of NPI cost relative to death. it measures the loss of productivity (person-days) due to implementing NPIs. c is a weight of NPI cost relative to death. NPIs cause person-day losses by shutting down vital activities, but mitigate person-day losses by reducing mortality. our model provides a mechanism for finding an NPI triggering scheme that helps minimize total person-day lost during the time period before vaccines become available. we let (s, i) represent the initial state x(0) = (s(0), i(0)), and V (x, u) = V ((s, i); u) be the associated value function. the expected value of V*(s, i) is calculated by integrating V ((s, i), u)f(T;) over the range of T. if V*(xA)-V* (xB) exceeds csu, it is cost-effective to implement the NPIs. we keep implementing NPIs until (x) > 0. Due to the complexity of the Eq. (5), the switching curve, (x), has no closed form. notation s(t) proportion of population that is susceptible in the community at time t, s(t) [0, 1] i(t) proportion of population that is infectious in the community at time t, r(t) [0, 1] r(t) v of population that has died in the community at time t, d(t) [0, 1] x(t) = (s (t), i(t), r(t), d u* = 0 proportion of the control space HJB Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation 1. at any time, t 0, the community is composed of S(t) susceptible, I(t) infectious, R(t) recovered, and D(t) deceased individuals. the population is closed, ignoring demographic turnover or immigration. to determine the value of c, the public health officials need to consider many factors, such as culture of the community, perceptions to death, consequences of pandemic and the NPIs, economic constraints, and etc. we assume that cost of NPI implementation increases with implementation strength. our model provides a mechanism for finding an NPI triggering scheme that helps minimize total person-days lost during the time period before vaccines become available. the objective is to minimize expected person-days lost over the time horizon, T, which is assumed to be the time when effective vaccine becomes available to the community. the expected value of V*(s, i) is calculated by integrating V ((s, i), u)f(T;) over the range of T. we can derive a first-order partial differential equation satisfied by the optimal value function, V*. if the HJB is nonlinear in u, the optimal control will not be bang-bang. if V*(xA)-V* (xB) exceeds csu, then it is cost-effective to implement the NPIs. we keep implementing NPIs until (x) > 0. Due to the complexity of the Eq. (5), the switching curve has no closed form. 2(a) presents the optimal isolation policy for = 0.4 and R0 = 1.33. 2(b) presents the optimal isolation policy derived in [37] for = 0.4 and R0 = 1.33. when the system state falls in region 1, NPIs should be implemented at maximum strength. figure 3 shows the impact of optimal control on pandemic severity, peak, and total deaths, when NPIs are triggered at different initial states. the proportions of recovered and dead population were set to 0. it is still best to implement NPIs at these states but the impact is limited. we computed control policies for systems assuming quadratic control cost instead of linear cost. the system dynamics still follow Eq. (1). the two regions of high level of u* in the upper corner and lower right corner correspond to two control regions 1 in Figure 2(b) the linear model tends to implement NPIs more intensely and save more lives while having a higher overall cost. there is no well-defined performance measure to evaluate the NPI policy. we chose because it captures the overall intensiveness of NPI implementations. we simulated the SIRD system under the optimal policy starting from all state (s0, i0, r0, d0), where s0 > 80%, i0 20%, and d0 = 0. The simulation was terminated at a randomly selected exponential terminal time. the estimated probability distribution functions (PDFs) of five input parameters, R0, 1/, 1/, c and b. we sampled ranges of parameters 1000 times using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to generate 1000 scenarios. the descriptive statistics for and dT are given in Table 4. after infection, 1/, and the time for an infectious person to recover, 1/, are the most statistically influential inputs. the CDF of dT shows that the mean of cumulative death is 14.25%, with a minimum of 0.63% and a maximum of 76.39%. for each flu scenario specified in the sensitivity analysis, a corresponding NPI policy can be obtained. we randomly selected a value from Exponential(0.0056) and a value Gamma(3, 59.5) as the vaccine arrival time (or simulation terminal time) the sampling was repeated 20 times for each scenario. the difference between the selected gamma and exponential terminal time exceeds 60% of the maximum of these two. for example, in a case where i0 = 1%, S0 = 95%, gamma terminal time = 235 days and exponential terminal time = 55 days, the difference in cumulative death is 32.04%. for a pandemic with = 0.6 and R0 = 2.0, Figure 2(d) tells us not to act until the percent infectious exceeds 50%. Figure 2(b) tells us to implement NPIs at an earlier stage of the outbreak, for example 99% susceptible and 1% infectious. figures 3(a) and 3(b) compare the epidemic curves with and without NPIs starting from a state 99% susceptible and 1% infected when = 0.4. d) compares the epidemic curves with and without NPIs, starting from a state 99% susceptible and 1% infected when = 0.4. d) compares cases for which R0 > 1, i.e., the uncontrolled infection spreads rather than dying out. the candidate control u* should satisfy: (9) By solving Eq. (8), we obtained the NPI policies for systems assuming quadratic control cost. Figure 4 shows a multi-level policy in which NPIs are applied at varying strength levels based on certain state criteria. the level of NPI policy decreases from 100% of maximum NPI level to 0%. Figure 4 presents the optimal NPI policy obtained under quadratic control cost. presents the optimal NPI policy assuming quadratic control cost for an influenza pandemic characterized as = 0.4, = 0.25, = 0.05, c = 0.05, and b = 0.2. the simulation was terminated at a randomly selected exponential terminal time. the mean cumulative death was calculated by taking the average of cumulative deaths over all tested initial states. the effect of NPIs, b, was found to reduce the infection rate by up to 30-50% in 1918. the descriptive statistics for and dT are given in Table 4, which lists the mean, variance, median, minimum, and maximum of and dT. for dT, the PRCCs are all statistically significant. the most influential inputs are 1/, R0, and 1/ (|PRCC| > 0.5) while the other two parameters are lessinfluential. a decrease in 1/ corresponds to an increase in dT; while an increase in R0 or 1/ corresponds to an increase in dT. we simulated the SIRD system starting from an initial state applying the corresponding NPI policy. the simulation was terminated at the sampled vaccine arrival times and the cumulative deaths were recorded. 210 initial states were selected, where s0 80% and i0 20%. early implementation for moderate and severe pandemic is very important for NPIs to have impact on the outbreak. late implementation might still be optimal, but the impact is much less. if we miss the beginning stage, it is not optimal to implement NPIs until the outbreak is significantly progressed. timely and sensitive surveillance systems are key to successful application of the optimal control method. surveillance systems should be able to identify the virus quickly and provide accurate estimates for parameters which characterize the severity of an influenza. the effectiveness of the control policy depends on the accuracy of these estimates. this suggests an influenza virus with a high death rate, a high basic reproductive number and a small recovery rate is less affected by NPI implementation. but NPI cost was identified as the most influential (PRCC = -0.865) in determining intensity of NPI implementation. a quadratic cost structure will require NPIs to be implemented in more states but with much lower intensity in those states. overall, a linear cost structure leads to higher average NPI intensity than the quadratic cost. the linear cost model appears to place more weight on death, thus implementing more control. model limitations Our model was limited in several ways. first, although HJB can be derived for models assuming terminal time. so far the control policy can only be computed assuming exponential terminal time. the benefit of NPIs at a stage when the disease has progressed significantly is less than the cost of NPI implementation. this finding supports the CDC pandemic mitigation guidelines. earlier NPI implementation reduces and delays the peak of the outbreak. if a severe pandemic occurs, hospitals will experience an overwhelming influx of patients. sensitivity analysis identified three important input parameters for determining the overall NPI intensity. the important parameters are the NPI cost, death rate, and recovery rate. for higher death rates, the policy sacrifices daily societal functions to save lives. linear v.s. quadratic cost function If the cost function is linear, the control policy is bang-bang, which suggests implementing NPIs at the maximum strength or not implementing at all. but the inverse is not true. linear cost structure leads to higher average NPI intensity than the quadratic cost. quadratic cost introduces complexity in parameter estimation, computation, and policy interpretation. for example, we must determine how to implement NPIs at X% of maximum. the bang-bang policy has only two levels, which is easier to understand and implement. the best control strategy for the model depends on the transmission characteristics of the influenza virus, the state of the pandemic, and the cost and implementation levels of NPIs. the optimal policy can be calculated for any combination of flu and cost parameters, which supports the idea of early containment. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions LF conducted the research, including model design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data. authors have given approval of the version to be published."}
