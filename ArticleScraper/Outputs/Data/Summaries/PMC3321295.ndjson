{"summary": "the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) acts as a homeostatic regulator of vascular function. its systemic actions include the regulation of blood pressure, natriuresis, and blood volume control. however, the RAS also plays an important local role, regulating regional blood flow and controlling trophic responses to a range of stimuli. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein [8] that is expressed and active in most tissues. the highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the kidney, the endothelium, the lungs, and in the heart. the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of ACE2 shows 48% sequence identity with collectrin [11], a protein recently shown to have an important role in neutral amino acid reabsorption from the intestine and the kidney [12]. ACE2 also contains calmodulin-binding sites [13] which may influence shedding of its catalytic ectodomain. ACE2 expression is reduced in established atherosclerotic plaques [26] and in proatherosclerotic states, such as diabetes [27]. direct evidence for ACE2 in the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques has only recently become available [5]. ACE2 and hypertension Activation of the RAS are the most widely used of all blood pressure lowering agents. the antihypertensive efficacy of these agents is partly mediated by their ability to reduce Ang II or its signalling. however, the antihypertensive effects of conventional RAS blockade are partly determined by the ability of both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to increase circulating levels of Ang 1\u20137. in the RVLM, ACE2 inhibits MLN4760 into the nucleus tractus solitarii. this suggests an additional role for central ACE2 in controlling baroreceptor responsiveness. the cardiac RAS plays a critical pathophysiological role in maintaining and subverting cardiac function in the setting of progressive heart failure. the balance of ACE and ACE2 in the heart is an important driving factor for progressive cardiac disease. ACE2 deficient mice have been reported to show increased age-related glomerulosclerosis in susceptible mice [54] and enhanced renal Ang II-induced renal oxidative stress, resulting in greater renal injury. downregulation of tubular ACE2 is associated with albuminuria or tubular injury. further inhibition of ACE2 results in augmented renal damage [56, 57]. ACE2 expression may be increased in human kidney disease. recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) or adenoviral (Ad)-ACE2 in animal disease models. overexpression of ACE2 in human endothelial cells attenuates Ang II-induced oxidative stress. overexpression of ACE2 in human endothelial cells attenuates Ang II-induced oxidative stress and subsequent increase in monocyte adhesion. rhACE2 is not normally expressed in high levels in myocytes, although it is present in the endocardium and other cardiac cells. other studies using transgenic overexpression of cardiac ACE2 have shown partial protection in the heart from ischemia-induced heart failure. clinical trials in this often fatal condition are now underway. potential for rACE2 to augment the vasculoprotective effects of ACE inhibition. the angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, suggests that the effects of enhancing the Ang 1\u20137 mas axis may be beneficial even in the setting of conventional RAS blockade. the alternative approach for augmenting ACE2 has been to increase its endogenous expression. in hypertensive SHRs, all-trans retinoic acid increases ACE2 expression and lowers blood pressure levels. NT has also shown antithrombotic action, reducing platelet attachment, and reducing thrombus formation. this compound will not come to clinical trials because of issues of solubility that restrict its formulation. but other drugs of the same class may prove more suitable."}
