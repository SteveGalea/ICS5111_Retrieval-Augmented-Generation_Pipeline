{"summary": "viral zoonotic infections are responsible for numerous emerging infectious diseases (1, 2). biological infection barriers (e.g., viral host factor usage and host restriction factors) can limit viral cross-species transmission. recent epidemics of MERS-CoV in west africa, Latin America, and the middle east highlight that RNA viruses frequently overcome these barriers, spread to humans, and cause severe disease. several new viruses were discovered and assigned to the related genus Pegivirus within the Flaviviridae. these viruses include simian pegivirus (SPgV; formerly known as GBV-A), simian pegivirus (SPgV; formerly known as GBV-A), and bat pegivirus (BPgV; formerly known as GBV-D) the viral NS3/4A serine protease can disrupt innate immune sensing by cleaving human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (17) and human TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing beta interferon (18), two critical adaptor proteins that link recognition of viral double-stranded RNA with interferon (IFN) induction. hepaciviral GBV and pegiviral SPgV, HPgV, and BPgV representative hepaciviral genome sequences and their cognate host MAVS sequences were downloaded from GenBank (Tables 1 and 2). in cases where cognate host MAVS sequences were not available, MAVS sequences from most closely related species were used as surrogates. omyscus maniculatus KC815310 RHV-3 SAR-46 678 Rhabdomys pumilio KC411807 Guereza hepacivirus (GHV) BWC08 686 Colobus guereza KC551800 Cattle hepacivirus (GHV) GHC25 678 Bos taurus KP265943 TABLE 2 Species origin of MAVS abbreviation Predicted MAVS length taxa clustered together was >70%. for each phylogeny generated, the tree with the highest log likelihood is presented. a discrete gamma distribution () was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. pWPI-FLAG were created using either PCR-based cloning strategies or synthesized gene fragments (gBlocks; IDT) to generate protease-inactive mutants, pWPI vectors expressing either human (Hu) or mouse (Mus musculus; Mu) MAVS were created previously. each amplicon was cloned into pWPI-FLAG. HEK 293T WT or HEK 293T-MAVS/ cells were transfected with a combination of 100 ng (or as indicated in the figure legends) plasmid DNA expressing the indicated protease and MAVS was then seeded into a poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 24-well plate. the cells were then lysed 48 h later prior to Western blotting. cells were lysed in 350 l passive lysis buffer (Promega) at 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed in 350 l passive lysis buffer (Promega) each sample was mixed with 5 denaturing protein sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.8], 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% sucrose, 3.3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol [2-ME]) anti-Mu MAVS MAb (0.6 g/ml) (E-6;
