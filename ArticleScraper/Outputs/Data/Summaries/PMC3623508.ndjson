{"summary": "the first smallpox vaccination conducted by Edward Jenner in 1796 demonstrated that inoculation of materials collected from a lesion on a milkmaid suffering from cowpox was able to protect humans from smallpox. this was a landmark moment in vaccine history since a virulent virus of one species was able to protect another species from clinical manifestations caused by a different virus that was potentially fatal. rabies vaccine was the very first virus deliberately attenuated in a in the case of vaccination for zoonotic diseases in livestock, it would be expected to reduce or remove the risk of transmission of such diseases to consumers as well as to protect industry animals. there have been growing evidence that the large-scale of nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock production is associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. the number of licensed animal vaccines for livestock and companion animals has increased over the decade. the number of licensed animal vaccines for livestock and companion animals has increased over the decade. the number of licensed animal vaccines for livestock and companion animals has increased over the decade. live vaccine viruses can be generated by inducing random mutations on viral genome and selecting a non-virulent mutant incapable of causing clinical diseases. virus is serially passed in a non-adapted host until they can effectively propagate. this produces the necessary immune response in the host if the host is challenged with infection by the original pathogenic virus. inactivated vaccines are safer than live vaccines because they cannot replicate at all in a vaccinated host, resulting in no risk of reversion to a virulent form capable of causing diseases. vaccines of this type are generally created by inactivating propagated viruses by treatment with heat or chemicals such as formalin or binary ethyleneimine. inactivated vaccines can be classified as a type of inactivated vaccine that contains only part of the virus or other microorganisms. the high costs of producing subunit vaccines would deteriorate the competitiveness of such vaccines compared to other types of vaccines. the open reading frame 2 protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a major agent responsible for developing post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome in pigs. a subunit vaccine capable of preventing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in poultry was successfully registered. nonpathogenic live virus carrying foreign DNA can be administered into a host. the gene of interest introduced within the vector vehicle is expressed in the vaccinated host so that the host elicits immune responses against the expressed protein. the immune response against the expressed protein carried by vehicle virus would follow a very natural stimulatory pathway. a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the glycoprotein of rabies virus was able to administer many types of wildlife in order to protect against rabies. such vaccine can be used as a DIVA vaccine since fowls vaccinated with this virus do not form antibodies against matrix protein or nucleoprotein. this provokes immune responses against HA protein in vaccinated chickens, resulted in protection against both diseases. a new concept vaccine, DIVA vaccine was established [21], describing as a vaccine that carries at least one antigenic protein less than the corresponding wild type virus. the vaccines are unable to produce antibodies against the protein of the deleted genes, but wild type virus invokes antibody against that protein. the diagnostic tools can be used to monitor transmission of wild type virus in populations vaccinated with a DIVA vaccine. the potential DIVA vaccine for CSF virus (CSFV) was a gE-deleted pseudorabies virus vector that expressed the E2 subunit of CSFV [27] this vaccine prevents the transmission of challenged CSFV to pig in contact with the vaccinated and challenged pigs. this vaccine prevents the transmission of challenged CSFV to pig in contact with the vaccinated and challenged pigs. nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of west Nile virus can be the most reliable indicator of past infection in animals. the NS1-competitive ELISA using a monoclonal antibody against the expressed NS1 demonstrated the capability of differentiating wild type virus infected animals from the animals vaccinated with killed WNV vaccine. this would be considered as a potential DIVA means capable of monitoring WNV transmission. chimeric circovirus type 1-2 vaccine was developed by inserting immunogenic capsid gene of circovirus type 2 into the backbone of nonpathogenic circovirus type 1. a bivalent vaccine expressing the H and N gene of different AIVs was constructed on a single NDV background. the recombinant virus expressing H5 and N3 proteins provided protection for chickens and ducks from HPAI virus strain, H5N1. gene of interest is cloned into a plasmid vector capable of expressing protective antigen in immunized animals in the absence of intact antigen. gene of interest is cloned into a plasmid vector capable of expressing the protective antigen in immunized animals. the VP1 gene of FMDV carries critical epitopes for inducing immune response to neutralize FMDV. a plasmid DNA containing the gD gene of ADV elicited serum neutralizing antibody at 4 weeks after immunization. a plasmid DNA containing the gD gene of ADV elicited serum neutralizing antibody at 4 weeks after immunization. the use of VLP would be a promising vaccination strategy for a variety of viruses [37], since it can elicit high titer, long-lived immunity to diverse viruses. the use of VLP would be a promising vaccination strategy for a variety of viruses. non-infectious recombinant pentamer-like structures of the FMDV were generated by expressing the gene for the P1 and 3C proteins. the recombinant protein of ORF2 was formed to be VLP in infected insect cells. the plasmid containing P12A and 3C genes of EMCV was generated and transfected into baculovirus expression system. live vaccine viruses can be generated by inducing random mutations on viral genome and selecting a non-virulent mutant incapable of causing clinical diseases. a single point mutation on certain gene may tend to induce attenuation of virus but may lead to back mutation, resulting in the wild type virulent virus. live vaccine viruses are capable of infecting target cells and provoking immune responses to injected viruses. live vaccines can easily be administered by various routes, such as injection, drinkable water, or instillation into the nasal cavity or eyes. s of this type are generally created by inactivating propagated viruses by treatment with heat or chemicals such as formalin or binary ethyleneimine. this procedure destroys the pathogen's ability to propagate in the vaccinated host, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognize it. inactivated virus vaccines have been used for preventing various types of viral diseases over the decades. several subunit vaccines have been launched on the market. a gene encoding immunogenic antigen is inserted into another carrier virus or into producer cells in culture system. the end result is a recombinant vaccine; the immune system of vaccinated host will recognize the expressed protein. recombinant proteins of both VP1 and 3D induce antigen-specific immune responses. the pre-membrane (prM) and envelop (E) proteins of japan encephalitis (JEV) were expressed in insect cells. the immunogenicity of the recombinant proteins was demonstrated by complete protection mice from a virulent virus challenge. recombinant canary pox virus shows abortive infections in mammalian cells. it can effectively express inserted genes. animal vaccines have been developed using this system. rabies vaccine is a prototype of vector vaccine currently in use in several countries. conventional vaccines are developed to primarily control disease in animals upon infection with pathogenic microorganisms. to control and eradicate animal viral disease, vaccine should not only prevent diseases but also reduce transmission of the virus from one animal to another. ated glycoprotein E-negative DIVA vaccine and a glycoprotein D-subunit DIVA vaccine have been demonstrated to reduce virus shedding after intranasal challenge of BHV-1. attenuated vaccine is used in countries where this disease is enzootic after an outbreak, but is not used for CSF free countries. another strategy used in countries with vaccinated pigs but no outbreaks any more is to switch from live to subunit vaccine before completely stopping vaccination. the DIVA concept used in veterinary vaccines may prove to be an important and useful strategy for the future development of human vaccines [21] nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of west Nile virus (WNV) can be the most reliable indicator of past infection in animals. chimeric circovirus type 1-2 vaccine was developed by inserting immunogenic capsid gene of circovirus type 2 into the backbone of nonpathogenic circovirus type 1. this chimeric virus was able to form strong immunity against both field influenza and NDV. the recombinant virus expressing H5 and N3 proteins derived from the other strains provided protection for chickens and ducks from HPAI virus strain, H5N1. gene of interest is cloned into a plasmid vector capable of expressing protective antigen in immunized animals in the absence of intact antigen. gene of interest is cloned into a plasmid vector capable of expressing protective antigen in immunized animals. recombinant vector vaccines have resulted in highly immunogenic response to foreign proteins. a vaccine retains the advantages associated with using live vectors, such as immunogenicity and ensuring delivery of the antigen in its native conformation. a vaccine containing the VP1 epitopes of FMDV has the ability to neutralize FMDV. a virus has a unique characteristic of self-assembling into particles. this characteristic makes it possible to generate VLPs in cell culture system. VLPs are differentiated from live attenuated virus by the lack of productive viral infection. a single inoculation of VLP vaccine expressing HA and M1 proteins of AIV subtype H9N2 elicited a high level of HI antibodies. immunization of VLP vaccine against HPAI was able to protect chickens from lethal challenge of wild type HPAI H5N1 virus. a plasmid containing P12A and 3C genes of EMCV was generated and transfected into baculovirus expression system. for PRRSV, VLP expressing M and N proteins was generated in baculovirus expression system, and immunized into mice to evaluate its ability of inducing PRRSV-specific immune responses. attenuated bacteria are able to infect and multiply in the vaccinated host. they no longer are capable of causing clinical disease as the result of impairment of biological function of virulent determinants. the major advantage of live vaccine is a broader scope and duration of protection because the animals are exposed to all stages of the replicating bacteria. virulence-associated genes in bacteria are critical for bacterial survival. in such a case, this strain cannot provide good immunity against the very virulence-associated protein. in such a case, this strain cannot provide good immunity as a vaccine strain. ppGpp-defective mutant of S. Gallinarum served as a novel vaccine candidate. the mutant conferred strong and durable immune-based protection against challenge. virulent strain of S. Typhimurium is caused by an obligated intracellular bacteria. tetanus toxoid was used as a vaccine antigen for subcutaneous immunization. cholera toxin B was expressed, purified, and added to bacteriae protein. recombinant vaccine had slightly higher efficacy when using tetanus toxoid. the immunogen in subunit vaccines may be purified proteins, peptides, or polysaccharide. the immunogen in subunit vaccines may be purified proteins, peptides, or polysaccharide. administration of vaccine with appropriate adjuvant enables induction of cell-mediated immunity. cloned vaccine antigen can be a plant-based edible vaccine candidate against ETEC. a number of species of live bacteria have been used for vaccine carriers. most of them are species with the ability to colonize intestinal mucosa. clone antigen is often much weaker than the response to carrier protein of origin. an attenuated Salmonella carrier as an oral delivery vector has been used for malaria, anthrax, and cholera. the challenge for creating carrier vaccines is that a vaccine strain should retain the sufficient ability of replication in the gut and be attenuated enough not to be pathogenic. the ability of certain bacteria to replicate intracellularly may increase the ability of expressed foreign peptide within the cells. recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant E. coli K99 fimbriae showed a significant inhibitory effect to E. coli K99, consequently prevented E. coli binding to intestinal brush border. pigs received swIL-8 by the recombinant Salmonella elicited the enhanced levels of pseudorabies-specific IgG and IgG2 compared to control group. polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic, linking the polysaccharide to a carrier protein. it creates stronger, combined immune responses to a piece of the bacteria. these types of vaccines are currently in use for Streptococcus pneumoniae. the current status of development of animal vaccines is highlighted in this section. animal vaccines can also be used to reduce the risk of transmitting zoonotic agents for industry animal to humans through the consumption of meat products. the demand for food products, including meats, is drastically being increased to supply the rapidly growing population worldwide. the development of a more specific diagnostic method will allow the development of both live and killed vaccine. several vaccines have shown limited effectiveness in reducing transmission of zoonotic agents to humans through the consumption of animal-derived products. spp., S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the serotypes most commonly associated with foodborne disease in humans. for poultry, various killed and live vaccines are commercially available. for poultry, various killed and live vaccines are commercially available. some vaccines containing whole bacteria or flagellin have provided partial protection against Campylobacter challenge in chickens. but attenuated live vaccine may be more promising in the near future. vaccine for chicken would be better way to prevent transmission to humans. live bacterial vaccines consist of a small quantity of attenuated bacteria that elicit good immune responses similar to that provoked by natural infection. the major advantage of live bacterial vaccine is a broader scope and duration of protection because the animals are exposed to all stages of the replicating bacteria. selective pressure on bacteria during in vitro passage enables bacteria to temporarily suppress virulence determinants and then restart their expression in vivo. the best targets for a bacterial genome are the genes associated with virulence determinants, biosynthesis, and regulatory genes which are critical for bacterial survival. salmonella enteritidis strain JOL919 [50], salmonella Gallinarum strain JOL 916 [51] and salmonella Typhimurium [52,53] a global regulator, ppGpp-defective mutant of S. Gallinarum served as a novel vaccine candidate. the mutant conferred strong and durable immune-based protection against challenge with virulent strain of S. Typhimurium. led vaccines are prepared by culturing bacteria, collecting cells, and inactivating them by suitable means, such as heat treatment or chemicals. this procedure destroys the ability of the pathogens to replicate in the host but keep it intact immunologically. killed vaccine tends to provide a shorter length of protection than live vaccine, and boosters are needed to create a long term immunity. vaccine antigen is based on the structural or biochemical features of hydrophobicity and homology to that of vaccine antigen of related pathogens. genes are expressed using foreign protein expression systems, including Escherichia coli, yeast, and insect or mammalian cells. the resulting product is combined with proper adjuvant and used as the subunit recombination vaccine. recombinant toxin B subunit (LTB) of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) can be used as an adjuvant, carrier of fused proteins, and antigen itself. a number of species of live bacteria have been used for vaccine carriers that enable the delivery of cloned vaccine antigen enterically or intransally. 21a strain of Salmonella was derived in the fashion and licensed for preventing typhoid fever. the goal of creating a carrier vector is to present foreign antigen to immune system in the context of a live bacterial infection. the host immune system recognizes the antigen as a natural-form immunogen and thereby develop a broader immunity to corresponding pathogen. recombinant lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant E. coli K99 fimbriae showed a significant inhibitory effect to E. coli K99. pigs received swIL-8 by the recombinant Salmonella elicited the enhanced levels of pseudorabies-specific IgG and IgG2 compared to control group. orF7 protein of PRRSV was constructed and immunized into mice. both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against ORF7 were induced at both systemic and mucosal sites. both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against ORF7 were induced. inoculation of a single dose of the conjugate induced the high titers of anti-V1 IgG. inoculation of the large amount of unconjugated V1 polysaccharide alone showed the suppression of anti-V1 antibody. animal vaccines can also be used to reduce the risk of transmitting zoonotic agents for industry animals through the consumption of meat products. effective vaccine for zoonotic pathogens in industry animals may help resolve public health concerns. on the basis of recent reports, 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, indicating that effective means to control such diseases would be of great value. the development of a more specific diagnostic method will allow the development of both live and killed vaccine. clinical salmonellosis for industry animals is the result of infection with host-restricted serotypes of Salmonella, such as S. Enteritis, S. Gallinarum, S. Dublin, and S. Pullorum. a subunit vaccine containing secreted virulence factors has been tested in the field in feedlot cattle. campylobacter jejuni is the major cause of foodborne disease in humans. this bacterium is very well adapted to chicken but has a low infectious dose for humans. in chicken, the bacteria can be heavily colonized in the gut without evident clinical signs. the best way to control brucellosis is to use hygienic measures as well as spelling out a specific protocol in production. the best way to control brucellosis successfully is to use hygienic measures as well as spelling out a specific protocol in production. industry animals are important vehicles for several foodborne pathogens, mainly enteric bacteria. development of animal vaccines should be achieved by multidisciplinary collaboration, including microbiology, immunology, proteomics, genetics, molecular biology, and even bioinformatics. vaccines that do not contain proper immunogenic antigens will not be effective, and therefore correct vaccines should be selected and applied for the proper of time. potent adjuvants should be able to effectively elicit cellular immunity in animals that are vaccinated with less immunogenic vaccines including killed or subunit vaccines. the other way to resolve this issue would be to develop a new delivery system, such as plasmid DNA, liposome, microparticles, and live viral or bacterial vectors."}
