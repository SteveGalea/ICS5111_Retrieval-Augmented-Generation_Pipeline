{"summary": "4EGI-1 binding site is distant to the eIF4G-binding site located at the N terminus of 1, helix-2, and the dorsal helices adjacent to the C-terminal end of helix-1. the data suggested an inhibitor contact site distant to the eIF4GII621\u2013634 peptide-binding epitope identified that was initially hypothesized as a potential binding site. structures were determined by molecular replacement at 1.5\u20131.8 resolution. 4EGI-1[E] binds to an epitope distant to the eIF4GII621\u2013634 binding site. the compound stretches from a hydrophobic bay next the C terminus of helix-1 to a pocket surrounded by three basic side chains. eIF4E/4EGI-1[E]/m7GTP complex packing and rmsd comparison shows local structural differences in four regions of eIF4E. each eIF4E chain A contacts two symmetrically related eIF4E chain A proteins. the four regions with the largest rmsd differences are indicated. currently, there are 27 eIF4E structures in the protein data bank database. the hand-like fold of eIF4E grabs the cap nucleotide at the ventral side. the 310-helical loop disappears and migrates back in sequence to elongate helix-1 at its C terminus. the o-nitro-phenyl group sticks into a pocket formed by the loop between strands-1 and -2 (residues 46\u201364) the backbone forms the bottom of the pocket and the side chains of K49, K54, and R61 constitute the basic rim. region III differences are just caused by the eIF4G\u2013peptide binding or different crystal contacts. the 4EGI-1\u2013induced dislocation of the 310-helix moves the side chain of Q80, exposed in the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, to a position where it interacts through water molecules with D127 of helix-2. this further stabilizes the new turn in helix-1. helix from the space between helices-1 and -2 to the C terminus of 1 opens a large cavity underneath helix-1 between the dorsal helices and the central -sheet. both long and short states of helix-1 were observed in the electron density map. final structure refinement resulted in a 47% occupation for the extended helix-1 and 53% occupation for the short helix-1 conformation. eIF4E/4EGI-1[E] is green and 4EGI-1[E] is drawn with yellow carbon spheres. the three regions with the majority of differences on the eIF4E/eIF4GII complex are highlighted cyan or purple. the 310-helix (S82-L85) has unfolded. helix1 (V69-H78) and the strand-2 (R61-F66) correspond to regions I and II of the rmsd comparison between the ligand-bound chain A and the ligand-free chain B. the other binding site, Site B, contacts the opposite lateral surface of the ligand 4EGI-1[E]. FITC-conjugated eIF4G\u2013peptide displacement from GST-eIF4E mutants by increasing concentrations of 4EGI-1[E]. mutations on fluorescence polarization peptide displacement activity by 4EGI-1 (IC50; blue bars) and eIF4G\u2013peptide binding (Kd); red bars. values were obtained by fitting the curves shown in Figs. S5 and S6. Error bars are shown, and data are plotted on a logarithmic scale. binding site in the eIF4E/eIF4GII621\u2013634 structure could lead to oligomerization through direct eIF4E protein\u2013protein contacts conferred on the induced structural changes to eIF4E. however, there is no evidence that free eIF4E forms a dimer in solution. this binding event would be inhibited if the dimer would be present in solution. no IC50 values are given for residues that disable peptide binding (L135R and R186E) the displacement and binding data are shown in Figs. S5 and S6. helix-1 exhibits an almost 10-fold lower affinity for the eIF4G peptide and twofold enhanced IC50 for 4EGI-1. helix-1 is significantly more mobile than the surrounding residues, which is indicated by the smaller rates. changes of signals in 1H-13C\u2013 and 1H-15N\u2013correlated NMR spectra of eIF4E on titration with 4EGI-1[E], the more soluble isomer. data suggested an inhibitor contact site distant to the eIF4GII621\u2013634 peptide-binding epitope identified that was initially hypothesized as a potential binding site. eIF4E/4EGI-1[E]/m7GTP complex reveals binding of the inhibitor to a lateral side of eIF4E and a 2:1 protein inhibitor stoichiometry. m7GTP is shown in magenta, and 4EGI-1[E] is shown with yellow carbon spheres. 4EGI-1[E] is drawn with yellow, red, and blue sticks. eIF4E/4EGI-1[E]/m7GTP complex packing and rmsd comparison of chain A to chain B shows local structural differences in four regions of eIF4E. there are 27 eIF4E structures in the protein data bank (PDB) database of various eIF4E constructs or homologs from human to yeast. the hand-like fold of eIF4E grabs the cap nucleotide at the ventral side, whereas the dorsal helices form a dimer in the crystal with C2 pseudosymmetry. the 310-helical loop disappears and migrates back in sequence to elongate helix-1 at its C terminus. the o-nitro-phenyl group sticks into a pocket formed by the loop between strands-1 and -2 (residues 46\u201364) the backbone forms the bottom of the pocket and the side chains of K49, K54, and R61 constitute the basic rim. eIF4E complexes are bound to eIF4GII621\u2013634 and eIF4G. rmsd values between structures of eIF4E bound to eIF4GII621\u2013634 and those bound to either 4EGI-1[E] or ligand-free eIF4E (Fig. 4C, blue bars) both long and short states of helix-1 were observed in the electron density map. final structure refinement resulted in a 47% occupation for the extended helix-1 and 53% occupation for the short helix-1 conformation. the helix-1 extension induced by 4EGI-1[E] comes with numerous additional localized structural changes. the three regions with the majority of differences on the eIF4E/eIF4GII complex are highlighted cyan or purple. the 310-helix (S82-L85) has unfolded. an extra turn on -helix1 (H78-S82) has formed. Binding site B contacts opposite lateral surface of ligand 4EGI-1[E] and is formed between -helix R173-L187 and the C-terminal -strand R214-V216. most obvious contacts that could lead to oligomerization through the small-molecule ligands are residues belonging to Sites A and B that sandwich 4EGI-1 analogs. eIF4E/eIF4G\u2013peptide complex was titrated with increasing amounts of 4EGI-1[E]. eIF4E is drawn in cyan, and eIF4GII(K622-A637) is drawn in orange. all values are normalized relative to WT eIF4E. mutants targeting sites A and B labeled as such. C indicates targeting the dorsal interface between eIF4E chains A and B. residues that make contact with the eIF4GII\u2013peptide in 1EJH. most of the eIF4E structures in the PDB contain a dimer in the crystal with contacts through the dorsal helices. however, there is no evidence that free eIF4E forms a dimer in solution. this binding event would be inhibited if the dimer was present in solution. we used measurements of 15N chemical shift anisotropy/dipole\u2013dipole (CSA/DD) cross-correlated relaxation rates to estimate the effective rotational correlation time c of eIF4E and its complex with 4EGI-1. of interest is L131 in eIF4E, which makes direct contact with the conserved L630 of eIF4G. eIF4G peptide has a 10-fold lower affinity for the eIF4G peptide and twofold enhanced IC50 for 4EGI-1. the helix extension and associated side-chain rearrangements are central to the allosteric mechanism. helix-1 is significantly more mobile than the surrounding residues. eIF4E/4EGI-1[E] complex confirmed the location of the inhibitor-binding site indicated by NMR. the structure confirmed the location of the inhibitor-binding site indicated by NMR. the key element seems to be helix-1. elongation of helix-1 by one turn (H78-S82) is crucial to prevent eIF4G recruitment. helicity-enhancing mutants N77E and H78E destabilize eIF4GII peptide binding. the region between L81-N84 shows a dramatic conformational change between a loop/3/10helix turn in the eIF4GII-bound state (blue) and an extra -helix turn in the 4EGI-1\u2013bound state (yellow) 4EGI-1 is shown with orange sticks, and the eIF4GII peptide is shown as a pink cartoon. the structure of the eIF4E/4EGI-1[E] complex suggests a similar mechanism of action for the analogous compounds 4E1RCat and benzoic acid derivatives. the most unexpected finding is that the 4EGI-1 binding site is located at the lateral surface of eIF4E distant to the known eIF4G fragment binding site on eIF4E. the parent compound has been shown to have antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo (8) and enhanced activity against hypoxic tumors (11) the results shown here may pave the way for development of a panel of therapeutics that target a tumor control point at the convergence of signaling pathways relevant for tumor formation. the flow through was applied for 1.5 h to an adipic-agarose-m7GDP column prepared as described before (36) for the purification of eIF4E. bound 26-eIF4E was eluted four times with 10 mL buffer containing 100 M m7GTP or m7GDP plus 10 mM TCEP. the mixtures were mixed with

Spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. relaxation delays of 11.1, 22.2, and 33.3 ms were used, corresponding to N/JNH, in which n = 1, 2, and 3 and JNH = 90 Hz. peak intensities were extracted using Sparky. a human GSTeIF4E construct was used to study the effect of single-amino acid mutations on the 4EGI1-[E] inhibitory activity against the eIF4E/eIF4G\u2013peptide complex formation. mutant constructs were expressed in E. coli under similar conditions as the 26-eIF4E protein described above. a solution of 1 M Apo-GB1-eIF4E that was prepared by elution with 1 M NaCl from the adipic-agarose-m7GDP column or m7GTP-GB1-eIF4E in 100 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.5, buffer was prepared. the results were fitted to a 1:1 binding equilibrium equation using the program GRAFIT 2.0. the lysed cells were centrifuged at 38,000 g for 1.5 h. the supernatant was syringe-filtered and passed through a diethylaminoethylcellolose column equilibrated in the same buffer. the flow through was applied for 1.5 h to an adipic-agarose-m7GDP column prepared as described before (36) ligand 4EGI1-[E] and analogs were dissolved in DMSO at 12.5 mM concentration based on dry powder weight. they were mixed with concentrated protein stock at a protein:ligand stoichiometry ranging between 2:1 and 1:5. structures containing two eIF4E molecules per asymmetric unit were solved by molecular replacement
