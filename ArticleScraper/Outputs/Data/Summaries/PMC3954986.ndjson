{"summary": "human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) was initially reported in china in 2002. it quickly spread to almost 30 countries, resulting in about 8000 infections with approximately 800 deaths. isolation of closely related strains from the horseshoe bat has been reported. pro and PLpro have been shown to be essential for viral replication. they can be categorized as covalent peptidomimetic, noncovalent peptidomimetic, and nonpeptidic. the development of PLpro inhibitors has been limited until recently. HCoVEMC PLpro contains an intact zinc binding motif, a catalytic triad, and a ubiquitinlike Nterminal domain. the PLpro enzyme contains an intact zinc binding motif, a catalytic triad, and a ubiquitinlike Nterminal domain. these leading inhibitors bind to a pocket formed mostly by the G267\u2013G272 loop and the Leu163 side chain. both scaffolds block substrate access to the entrance of the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme. the publisher did not receive permission from the copyright owner to include this object in this version of this product. additional enzymatic analyses and computational studies were used to predict the fragment binding locations. a fragmentmerging strategy was employed to predict nextgeneration compounds that are able to recapitulate the binding position of the lead inhibitors. high PEIrange compounds (>4.0) were classified as outliers due to the strong likelihood of nonspecificity. IC50 values varied from 149 m (fragment F2) to 427 m (fragment F6), and are summarized in Table 1. fragments PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a cysteine in the active site. covalently interacting compounds are likely to be nonspecifically reactive and usually have toxicity issues. fragment F3 may not be a good candidate, although it was the best enhancer for scaffold B inhibitors. the binding affinities of inhibitors 1\u20134 varied between 0.97 and 1.67 m. fragments F2, F6, and F8 were respectively 202, 461, and 437 m. however, these three fragments, as well as fragment F7, all bind nonspecifically. two crystal structures with these compounds verify that they bind at the entrance of the catalytic site, blocking substrate access to the site. the data were fitted to four equations [Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) in Experimental Section] and three plots (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Lineweaver\u2013Burk, and Dixon) Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of inhibitor 1 (=2.6) with respect to the substrate are shown in Figure 3 a. the resulting K i value was 0.42 m. all three fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with different values. inhibition model was the best fit for both inhibitor 1 and fragment F8, producing respective values of 2.6 and 1.6. however, this information is insufficient to identify where the fragments bind on the PLpro enzyme. a catalytic pocket was designated as candidate fragment binding site 1. the second position identified by FTMAP, hot spot 2, was located >10 away from both the lead inhibitor binding site and the catalytic site of PLpro. the small volume containing the catalytic triad (site 1) was not identified by FTMAP, likely due to the smaller size of this pocket. candidate binding site 2 is the unoccupied catalytic pocket (Figure 4 b) the surrounding residues of candidate binding site 2 are shown in blue. the fragments bind in combination with the lead inhibitors in a separate binding site of the enzyme. fragment F8 was selected for use in these studies due to its strong synergistic effect on both inhibitors 2 and 3. the fragment was docked into each of the three candidate binding sites discussed above, and three docking poses for each fragment were selected for further simulation. tables S1 and S2 revealed that the catalytic site, site 1, was also not a favorable position for fragment binding. the binding free energy values for the inhibitor with fragment F8 at this position were higher than those calculated for the inhibitor alone. these results indicate that the catalytic site is most likely not the binding site of the identified synergistic fragments. proposed compounds were selected by score and their ability to recapitulate key binding features of the inhibitor and synergistic fragment. key binding features of the inhibitor and synergistic fragment are conserved, including the lipophilic interactions of the naphthalene ring system and the positioning of the positively charged amine of the piperazine. the Zenobia library, consisting of 352 chemically and structurally diverse fragmentlike compounds, was experimentally screened in the presence of each of the previously discovered lead inhibitors. all fragment compounds were tested by continuous kinetic enzymatic assays as described in the Experimental Section below. the IC50 values of inhibitor 1 were enhanced 9.1 and 8.1fold. fragments F4 and F8 also enhanced inhibitor 2 by 3.1fold. fragment F3 appeared to have better synergy with scaffold B inhibitors. pIC50 divided by M r for BEI and pIC50 divided by PSA for SEI were >25, suggesting that they are outliers due to the possibility of nonspecific interaction. fragments F8, F8, F6/F8 and F6 are the best enhancers for inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. fragments were suspected of forming nonspecific interactions due to their unusually high BEI values. they did not show a typical dose\u2013response curve as concentrations increased. however, they showed a random binding pattern as shown in Figure 2 c. kinetic studies for each compound were performed with the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes and varying substrate concentrations. the data were fitted to four equations [Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) in Experimental Section] and three plots (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Lineweaver\u2013Burk, and Dixon) each using SigmaPlot Enzyme kinetics module 1.3. all four lead inhibitors and two fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with >1. this is likely that these newly identified fragmentlike compounds bind to another site that is not a catalytic site, hindering substrate binding to the enzyme. two crystal structures of inhibitor 2 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3E9S) and inhibitor 3 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3MJ5) were used for the analyses. these two provided representative crystal structures for each compound scaffold. these two provided representative crystal structures for each compound scaffold. the second candidate site (lower circle) is encompassed by the zinc binding motif. the second candidate site (lower circle) is encompassed by the palm region. the second candidate site (lower circle) is encompassed by the zinc binding motif. these studies were performed using molecular docking, molecular simulations, and molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations to predict binding free energy (G bind) of the lead inhibitors when the synergistic fragments were placed in the adjacent candidate binding sites. hot spot 2 was excluded from these studies due to the large distance (>10) from the inhibitor binding site. fragment were selected for further simulation. postanalysis of the simulation results by MM/PBSA allowed calculation of binding free energies of the lead inhibitors. three different docked conformations, C1 (circles), C2 (triangles) and C3 (squares) were selected for calculations. more negative numbers represent better binding conformation, with those marked by black arrows being the best. fragment F8 (orange) in combination with lead inhibitors a) 2 (magenta) and b) 3 (magenta) is the most probable binding conformation of fragment F8 (orange) in combination with lead inhibitors a) 2 (magenta) and b) 3 (magenta) key binding features of the inhibitor and synergistic fragment are conserved. the publisher did not receive permission from the copyright owner to include this object in this version of this product. the 352 compounds in the Zenobia library are functionally and chemically diverse and synthetically accessible for further optimization. the four lead inhibitors 1\u20134 were synthesized by Dr. A. K. Ghosh. native PLpro cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37 \u00b0C by shaking at 200 rpm in LB medium (2 L volume) containing ampicillin (100 g mL1) and chloramphenicol (34 g mL1) the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm (Beckman JA10) for 15 min. the supernatant was then subjected to a 40 % ammonium sulfate the native PLpro was eluted with a stepwise gradient with buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm BME) the protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient with buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm BME) PLpro enzyme solution (10 nm final concentration) was prepared in the presence of each of the four lead inhibitors at a concentration equal to its IC50 value. PLpro in the absence of any inhibitors was also prepared as controls. screened compounds at 20 each IC50 concentration for 30 min at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mm GSH, 0.01 % Triton, 0.1 mg mL1 BSA, and 1 % DMSO in a final volume of 200 L. PLpro with the same amount of DMSO in place of fragment compounds was also prepared in the same way as a control. the four previously discovered inhibitors and seven identified Zenobia fragment compounds were prepared as 10 mm (inhibitors 1\u20134) or 200 mm (fragments) DMSO stocks. the data were fit to the following equations using SigmaPlot 11.0. all MD simulations were performed using the AMBER suite of programs (AMBER 11). the two known cocrystal structures (inhibitorbound, PDB IDs: 3E9S and 3MJ5) were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. the bound inhibitor and zinc ions were retained in the systems. sixteen different probes were used: ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, dimethyl ether, cyclohexane, urea, methylamine, phenol, benzaldehyde, benzene, acetamide, and N,Ndimethylformamide. cluster sites identified by FTMAP were required to be conserved among all molecular probes for selection and binding site 1 was defined by selecting residues H273, C112, and D287. binding site 2 was defined by selecting residues R167, E168, M209, D303, and T302. binding site 3 was defined by selecting residues R167, E168, M209, D303, and T302. the first 100 frames from the last 2 ns of the simulation trajectory file were used for the MM/PBSA calculations. the ionic strength was set to 0.1 m, and the internal dielectric constant was set as 1.0 (default). the values for the free energy of binding of each inhibitor were calculated according to Equation (6):(6). inhibitor scaffold after docking the merged hybrids. the structures of PLpro bound with GRL0617S (PDB ID: 3E9S) and GRL0667S (PDB ID: 3MJ5) were used in these docking studies and prepared using the Schr\u00f6dinger protein preparation software. each system was solvated using 8 TIP3P water in a rectangular box. the system was equilibrated for 100 ps using the NVT ensemble without restraint. candidate binding site 3 was identified using coarse docking studies. fragments were docked to the enzyme using GlideXP and the Induced Fit Docking protocol of Schr\u00f6dinger. the structures of PLpro bound with GRL0617S were obtained from the RCSB protein databank. a library were prepared in multiple tautomer and protonation states at pH 7.4. all eight active fragments were docked in the coarse docking studies. only fragment F8 was docked in subsequent candidate site docking studies. the free energy values for each of these terms were estimated as the sum of the four terms:(7) (7) (7) in which E MM is the molecular mechanics energy of the molecule expressed as the sum of the internal energy of the molecule. a fragment merging strategy was employed based on the binding conformations observed from MM/PBSA studies. the docking site was defined as a 10 box centered on the original binding site of the lead inhibitors. the hybrid compound library was prepared as described above for fragment and inhibitor docking. ing, Visualization, and Informatics at the university of California, San Francisco.
