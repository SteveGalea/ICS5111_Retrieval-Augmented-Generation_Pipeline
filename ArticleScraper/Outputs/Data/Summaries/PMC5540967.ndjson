{"summary": "veterinary medicine considers prophylactic vaccines to be the most cost-effective tool for preventing viral infections. veterinary viral vaccines aim to protect vulnerable host animals from fatal infectious diseases by inducing a rapid and long-lasting immune response and by preventing the spread of such diseases among populations. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a paramyxovirus that infects birds, is used as an important vaccine vector for development of bivalent vaccines against pathogens of economic importance to poultry industry. many studies demonstrate that NDV is a promising vector for delivery of protective antigens derived from pathogens infecting mammals and humans. the length of the NDV genome follows the \u201crule of six\u201d which allows efficient virus replication because the N protein binds effectively to six nucleotides. the N protein binds to the genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid (NC) core, and the P and L proteins associate with the NC core to form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. NDV enters the cell cytoplasm via viral attachment and subsequent membrane fusion. the viral NC or RNP complex is then released into the cytoplasm. the viral RNA (plus-strand) serves as the template for synthesis of viral RNA genome. rNDV cells are infected with MVA and cotransfected with a NDV cDNA clone (LaSota backbone) and three helper plasmids (N, P, and L) the recovered viruses are purified on HEp-2 cells in a plaque assay. insertion of foreign genes into the full-length cDNA clone is a pivotal step for generating rNDV expressing foreign antigens. foreign gene can be placed at any intergenic site within the NDV genome. the length of the inserted foreign gene also affects efficient expression of the foreign antigen. a single NDV vector can accommodate foreign genes up to 4.5 kb in length with a good degree of stability. veterinary vaccines NDV vaccines have been used to develop antigen delivery vaccines for use in cattle/sheep, dogs/cats, pigs, and horses. antigen delivery vaccines for veterinary use include those that protect against bovine herpesvirus 1 [19], bovine ephemeral fever virus [20], rift Valley fever virus [21], vesicular stomatitis virus [23], canine distemper virus [24], BHV-1 is a major cause of respiratory tract disease in cattle. a major problem with the current modified live BHV-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection. a single intranasal/intratracheal immunization with rLaSota/gDFL (1.5107 PFU/dose) induced marked mucosal and systemic antibody responses in calves. intranasal challenge with a high dose of virulent BHV-1 strain Cooper led to a marked reduction in viral shedding and more rapid clearance of challenge virus. habdovirus causes a fatal neurologic disease (rabies) in humans and animals. more than 55,000 people die of rabies each year, with about 95% of deaths occurring in Asia and Africa. rL-RVG induced production of RV neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those induced by a live attenuated rabies vaccine. rNDV-Gag/Env, rNDV-Env/Gag Env/Gag Env/Gag P/M Guinea pig i.n./twice/3 105 PFU [34] Influenza virus A/H1N1 Live rNDV/B1-HA HA P/M Mouse i.v./twice/3 107 PFU [35] SARS-CoV Live NDV-VF/S S i.n., intranasal; HA, hemagglutinin; i.v., intravenous; HPAIV; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; o.n., oro-nasal; SARS-CoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; S, spike; EBOV, Ebola virus; GP, glycoprotein; NiV, Nipah virus; i.m., intramuscular; two intravenous inoculations of mice with the rNDV/B1-HA vaccine induced a strong anti-influenza virus antibody response. two oro-nasal administrations of the rNDV/B1-HA vaccine induced a high serum titer of HPAIV neutralizing antibodies and a robust mucosal immunoglobulin A response. the modified rNDV-VP1 vaccine grew to a high titer in embryonated chicken eggs. it produced high levels of VP1 protein in the allantoic fluid. this suggests that the modified rNDV-VP1 vaccine has potential as a live attenuated vaccine against noV in humans. veterinary vaccines NDV vaccines have been used to develop antigen delivery vaccines for use in cattle/sheep, dogs/cats, pigs, and horses. antigen delivery vaccines for veterinary use include those that protect against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) [19], bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) [20], vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [22], canine distemper virus BHV-1 is a major cause of respiratory tract disease in cattle. a major problem with the current modified live BHV-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection, with the associated risk of subsequent reactivation. intranasal challenge with a high dose of virulent BHV-1 strain Cooper led to a marked reduction in viral shedding and more rapid clearance of challenge virus. results suggest that NDV may have utility as a vaccine vector. RVFV, a mosquito-borne bunyavirus that infects ruminants (cattle and sheep), causes severe economic losses to the livestock industry. animal experiments demonstrated that rL-RVG induced production of RV neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those induced by a live attenuated RV vaccine (ERA strain) rL-RVG provided complete protection against challenge with a potentially fatal virus strain (GX/09) for more than 1 year. human vaccines have been used as virus vectors to develop antigen delivery vaccines for use in humans.
