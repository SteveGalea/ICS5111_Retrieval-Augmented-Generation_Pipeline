{"summary": "autophagy initiates when proteins, membranes, and organelles are engulfed into a unique double-membraned structure known as an autophagosome. this vesicle matures by acidification and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome. autophagy plays important roles in breaking down protein aggregates and cellular structures as well as recycling of intracellular components. in 1962, Samuel dales and Richard Franklin published a fine structure study of murine L cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus. the images demonstrate cytoplasmic regions filled with multi-lamellar structures, which we would now identify as autophagosomes. this is the first demonstration that we can find of autophagic induction in a picornavirus-infected cell. double-membraned vesicles in PV-infected cells reflect in vivo intracellular rearrangements. vesicle formation during picornavirus infection has been accumulating for more than half a century. the predominant hypothesis for the role of autophagosomes in the viral life cycle is that they serve as a physical substrate for RNA replication. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replicates on reticulovesicular network of membranes, including endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles. replication complexes are found on modified lysosomes [16] for picornaviruses, the origin of the replication-associated membrane is not yet fully understood. there have been, to date, three hypotheses proposed for the membrane origin of picornavirus replication-associated membrane mTOR complex mTORC1 acts upstream of the autophagic pathway to suppress autophagic membrane formation. 3-MA suppresses autophagy due to its inhibition of PI3 kinases that interact with Beclin-1. a phagophore elongates around cytosolic contents until the contents are completely sequestered within a fully formed double-membraned autophagosome. the autophagosome matures, becoming acidic, and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome. it is possible that autophagosomes contain Sec13, Sec31, and Arf1. immuno-EM experiments were performed on PV-infected HeLa cells. initial experiments suggested PV induced double-membraned autophagic-like structures 50\u2013500 nm in diameter. this is consistent with previous work, but these structures are smaller than typical autophagosomes, which range from 500\u20131500 nm in diameter. LC3-II appears to be required to complete formation of the autophagosome. a relative increase in LC3-II levels is indicative of increased autophagy. the ubiquitin-binding protein p62 also interacts with LC3-II to target cargo to autophagosomes for degradation. autophagosomes were forming and perhaps maturing in the presence of PV. only when the two proteins were co-expressed did LAMP1 co-localize with GFP-LC3. autophagy inhibitor drug 3-MA decreased viral yield. levels of LC3-II were significantly increased during infection. both viral titer and expression of the capsid protein VP1 decreased in the presence of 3-MA. rapamycin treatment enhanced viral titer, and VP1 levels increased. small (250 nm) autophagosome-like vesicles were observed. some megaphagosomes (2\u20133 m) were also detected and appeared to have double membranes. HRV-14, a major group virus, and HRV-2, a minor group virus, have been shown to induce autophagy [31] as with PV, infection with either HRV-2 or HRV-14 caused a co-localization of LAMP1 with punctate GFP-LC3 in MCF-7 cells. however, recent work showed that HRV-2 induces and subverts the autophagic pathway in order to promote viral replication. EM analysis detected autophagosome-like vesicles of 100\u2013500 nm in diameter. LC3-II levels also increased via Western blotting. phosphorylation of both mTOR and its downstream target S6 kinase decreased during viral infection. EM showed that formation of single-membraned and double-membraned structures increased during FMDV infection. these structures co-localized with LC3 as well as the viral protein 2B. EMCV induces the formation of autophagosome-like vesicles in order to enhance virus production. siRNAs against either LC3 or ATG7 resulted in a reduction in intracellular viral yields as well as a decrease in the levels of VP1 protein detected via Western. this work indicates that autophagy promotes EMCV replication. however, the mechanism may differ between PV and coxsackieviruses. 2BC is sufficient to induce lipidation of cytosolic LC3-I to generate membrane-associated LC3-II. expression of either 2B or 2C alone was not sufficient to increase LC3-II levels. the specific role of 3A in forming autophagosomes is not yet understood. y appears to be unique among virus families. a large number of picornaviruses have been shown to subvert the autophagy pathway. this suggests a common mechanism used by most species of the picornavirus family. the trafficking and localization of the autophagosome may be advantageous. there may be an advantage to subverting autophagy that we do not understand."}
