{"summary": "the median incubation period is 4.5 days (95% CI 3.9-5.2 days) for astrovirus, 1.2 days (95% CI 1.1-1.2 days) for norovirus genogroups I and II, 1.7 days (95% CI 1.5-1.8 days) for sapovirus and 2.0 days (95% CI 1.4-2.4 days) for rotavirus. acute viral gastroenteritis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the incubation period is important for accurate surveillance for healthcare associated infections. the incubation period is often used to determine the infecting exposure in foodborne outbreaks. the incubation period is often used to determine the infecting exposure in foodborne outbreaks. astrovirus, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rotaviruses, rota a large number of foodborne outbreaks described in the literature did not report exact meal times. we established standard exposure intervals that were used in abstracting individual-level data for studies in which mealtimes were reported as just \u201cbreakfast\u201d, \u201clunch\u201d, or \u201cdinner\u201d. in a log-normal distribution, approximately two-thirds of cases develop symptoms between median/dispersion and median dispersion. each data point contained a range of possible exposure times, for example \u201cdinner\u201d and a range of possible times of symptom onset. maximum-likelihood estimates were found using the coarseDataTools package for R [25,27] we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ISI Web of Knowledge 4.0. searches were conducted between January 20, 2011 and august 16, 2011. data abstraction Statements of the incubation period and individual-level data suitable for pooled analysis were abstracted as described in Lessler et al., 2009. a large number of foodborne outbreaks described in the literature did not report exact meal times, we established standard exposure intervals that were used in abstracting individual-level data. maximum-likelihood estimates were found using the coarseDataTools package for R [25,27]. Confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping (500 iterations) pooled data for each norovirus genogroup were analyzed individually, data from genogroups I and II were analyzed together. incubation periods ranged from 1.1 days (for genogroup I noroviruses) to 4.5 days (for astrovirus). dispersions ranged from 1.22 to 1.82. full distributions superimposed onto histograms of latent period data are shown in Figure 3. study type N Population Comments Astrovirus Kurtz et al.

RAL and KER participated in the design and conception of the study."}
