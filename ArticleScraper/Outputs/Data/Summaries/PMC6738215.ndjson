{"summary": "air contains multiple potential hazards for the airways including viruses, bacteria, pollen, and other potentially noxious particles. the area of an unfolded pair of lungs is around 50\u201375 m2 (approx. the size of half a tennis court) surfactant proteins A\u2013D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) were originally characterised in the 1980s. the new nomenclature for surfactant-associated proteins was suggested by Dr. Possmayer in 1988. human SP-D has a glycosylation at serine 72 in the collagenous region. SP-A has one at asparagine 187; the glycosylation pattern varies at these residues from simple mono-antennary to multi-antennary glycosylations. cysteine residues in the N-terminal region of SP-D have been secreted as trimeric units. a mutation of these 2 cysteine residues to serine residues resulted in the SP-D being secreted as trimeric units only. the exact configuration of the disulphide bridges in mature SP-A proteins has not been determined. recombinant fragment of human SP-A1 (rfhSP-A) has been developed and characterised. crystal structure of the fragment has been resolved, providing an important insight into the structure of the trimeric CRD and neck. monomers in the trimeric fragment have been named A, B, and C, respectively. a deviation from symmetry has been observed in the projection of a single tyrosine sidechain (Tyr228) from monomer C into the centre of the coiled coil. the neck region shows a structural continuation with the -helices of the CRDs and is thought to induce a sharp bend in the SP-D molecule. trimeric neck-CRD rfhSP-D and rfrSP-A showed the \u201cY\u201d shape of SP-D and the \u201cT\u201d shape of SP-A. the 3 calcium ions found for SP-D and 1 for SP-A are shown as black spheres at the lectin-binding site. the overall fold of the CRD is similar in SP-D, SP-A, and MBL. the lectin domain's preferences for oligosaccharides found on the surface of micro-organisms enables the lectins to distinguish self from non-self in a relatively simple manner. the lung collectins SP-A and SP-D have numerous innate immune system functions, which are reviewed elsewhere in more detail. the binding to biological non-microbial ligands is calcium-dependent. both SP-A and SP-D are opsonins and enhance microbial uptake by innate phagocytes. both are opsonins and enhance microbial uptake by innate phagocytes. both SP-A and SP-D have been shown to bind to surface-bound myeloperoxidase [44] as well as DNA and RNA [43, 45, 46], and can therefore bind different ligands found on the surface of apoptotic cells. binding to DNA is not only part of the clearing mechanism but also has an impact on the clearance of microorganisms via neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) the stimulation of immature BMDCs with SP-A or primary ex vivo \u201clung antigen presenting cells\u201d with SP-D was also shown to inhibit the stimulation of T cells. this coincides with SP-A and SP-D having previously been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human T cells. inflammation in the lung could damage the thin and delicate alveolar-capillary membrane and negatively impact on gas exchange. ligation forms an 8-coordinate calcium ion complex with the charged amino acids residues of asparagine (Asn323), glutamic acid (Glu321), aspartic acid (Asp342), and Glu329 in the lectin-binding site, explaining the calcium-dependent binding. human SP-D and rat SP-A have only been crystallised with simple carbohydrates which interact with the primary calcium ion but not the auxiliary one(s) rfhSP-D has a higher affinity for manNAc than mannose. this difference was probably due to asp325 directly forming a hydrogen bond with the NAc group. rat, mouse, cow, and pig have a lysine residue in this position. rfhSP-D contains a funnel formed by the 3 CRDs in the centre of the trimeric rfhSP-D. the 3 Glu232 residues in the trimer coordinate a potential Ca2+ ion (Ca4) into the bottom of this funnel at calcium concentrations > 2 mM. this has been suggested to act as a molecular switch to reduce the neutralizing effect of the Glu232 residues exerted on the Lys246 residues fusion proteins are synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor. they are cleaved into their fusogenically active metastable prefusion forms. this cleavage has been suggested by host cell proteases embedded in cellular membrane. IAV and RSV fusion proteins are made up as a trimer with 3 copies of a single protein. the fusion envelope protein of HIV is made up of 2 non-covalently associated glycoproteins. fusion proteins which are unrelated in protein sequence are those found on viruses within the herpesvirus family. the gB protein from both HSV-1 and EBV undergoes a similar conformational change to that seen with viral class I proteins. this conformational change mediates the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. they have a trimeric configuration similar to the trimeric structure of SP-A and SP-D. binds to sialyated asparagine 187 residue of human SP-A in a calcium-independent manner. this binding occupies the HA-binding site, preventing the binding of IAV to sialylated receptors. deficient mice showed decreased viral clearance of IAV (H3N2 Phil/82 strain) human SP-D with 2 mutations, Aps325 mutated to an alanine and Arg343 to a valine (D325A + R343V), showed increased binding affinity to HA. the crystal structure confirmed that the mutated SP-D was binding to the glycosylation found at N165 at the very tip of the HA molecule. strains with various glycosylations found that the wild-type SP-D fragment binded to glycosylations at N165 and N246. in 20 simulation models, 18 of these would include either N165 and N246, highlighting that these residues are important for native SP-D being able to bind to and clear the influenza virus. rfhSP-A, rfhSP-D and rfhSP-D have been shown to be effective at neutralising RSV in an in vitro model of bronchial epithelial cells and an in vivo mouse model. but it is unclear how SP-A and SP-D interact with RSV. the RSV fusion protein is also a trimeric protein with a coiled-coil conformation. the mechanism of the potential binding of SP-A and SP-D to F proteins of different RSV strains now needs to be elucidated. SP-A binding has been shown to inhibit CD4 binding by gp120. binding to gp120 was shown to prevent binding of cyanovirin to gp120. this contrasts with cyanovirin, which neutralizes through targeting a specific set of N-linked glycosylations. a rfhSP-D molecule lacking the N-terminal domain has also been shown to neutralise HIV in vitro. a fragment lacking the N-terminal region has the capacity to neutralise HIV in vitro. if this is the case, these functional recombinant fragments could have therapeutic potential to prevent the infection and spread of HIV. the interaction between SP-A and IAV has not been studied in detail. SP-A has also been shown to bind to HSV [99, 100], which has trimerised surface proteins similar to HA on IAV. IAV and RSV fusion proteins are made up as a trimer with 3 copies of a single protein. the fusion envelope protein of HIV is made up of 2 non-covalently associated glycoproteins. another example of fusion proteins which are unrelated in protein sequence are those found on viruses within the herpesvirus family. a similar conformational change has mediated the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. they have a trimeric configuration similar to the trimeric structure of SP-A and SP-D. this binding can protect the host through various mechanisms. mice deficient for SP-A (SP-A\u2013/\u2013) or SP-D (SP-D\u2013/\u2013) have shown that both molecules are involved in the clearance of IAV. the efficiency of SP-D clearance of influenza is proportional to the degree of glycosylation of the HA molecule. the crystal structure confirmed that the mutated SP-D was binding to the glycosylation found at the very tip of the HA molecule. this model suggested that this native fragment also binded to the N165 glycan located at the tip of the HA molecule. however, the wild-type and double-mutant SP-D fragments bind to the HA molecule slightly differently. in 20 simulation models, 18 of these would include either N165 and N246, highlighting that these residues are important for native SP-D being able to bind to and clear the influenza virus. the reassorted X-79 IAV (H3N2 Phils82/A on the outside of the virus particle and A/PR/8/34 on the inside [78] is normally inhibited by SP-D in wild-type mice with normal levels of SP-A. rfhSP-A and rfhSP-D have been shown to be effective at neutralising RSV in an in vitro model of bronchial epithelial cells and an in vivo mouse model. however, it is unclear how SP-A and SP-D interact with RSV. the binding of SP-A and SP-D to gp120 was shown to be inhibitable by EDTA as well as various hexoses. the binding of SP-A and SP-D to gp120 has also become clear. SP-A binding has been shown to inhibit CD4 binding by gp120. binding to gp120 was shown to prevent binding of DC-SIGN to gp120. binding of SP-A and SP-D to gp120 is likely similar to the DC-SIGN-gp120 interaction. a rfhSP-D molecule lacking the N-terminal domain has also been shown to neutralise HIV in vitro. a fragment lacking the N-terminal region has the capacity to neutralise HIV in vitro. a fragment lacking the N-terminal domain has also been shown to neutralise HIV in vitro. interactions between SP-A and IAV have not been studied in detail. the interaction was specific to SP-D and was found to be dependent on the glycosylation status of the SP-A protein itself. the adaptive immune system is thought to have developed after the innate immune system. the ficolins have a fibrinogen-like domain [106, 107] which binds to specific pathogen-associated carbohydrates such as GlcNAc and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) the ficolins have a fibrinogen-like domain [106, 107] which binds to specific pathogen-associated carbohydrates such as GalNAc and D-fucose. sylated and trimerised innate immunity proteins bind to bacteria, pollen, and other potentially noxious ligands. these multiple functions are essential for keeping the lungs free from infection, while balancing the immune system to avoid excessive inflammation. these functions are thought to be important in applying a brake to the adaptive immune system. these trimeric collectins have evolved to recognise and competitively bind the structurally similar trimeric viral fusion proteins. this prevents attachment to the host cell, neutralises the virus and enhances its clearance from the body. mutated forms of neck-CRD rfhSP-D with increased affinities towards certain ligands could now be developed. asp325 has been identified as a key antigenic epitope. more research is required to evaluate whether it would be more beneficial to use native forms or mutated forms of the collectins for therapeutic purposes in the future. development of new clinical treatments against infectious diseases is critical.
