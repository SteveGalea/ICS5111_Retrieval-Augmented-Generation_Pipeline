{"summary": "avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a large family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and intestinal infections in avian and mammalian species. a certain coronavirus species may exhibit wider host specificities. cross-species transmission was also observed in coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus OC43 [5]\u2013[7]. a total of 49 amino acid substitutions were found during adaptation of IBV from chicken embryo (EP3) to vero cells (p65) [10]\u2013[12]. expression of S protein cloned from IBV strains EP3, CK, passage 7 (p7) and p65 of vero-adapted IBV showed induction of cell\u2013cell fusion by S(CK), S(p7) and S(p65) constructs. slide chambers were infected with vaccinia/T7 virus for 1 hour. at 12 hours post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 10% normal goat serum, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. RT-PCR was performed using the Expand Reverse Transcription and High Fidelity PCR Kits (Roche) the PCR products were cloned into PCR\u00ae-XL-TOPO\u00ae vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by automated sequencing. full-length cDNA clones from p65 of vero-adapted IBV were previously reported. the transfected Vero cells were cultured overnight in 1% FBS-containing MEM in a 60 mm dish or a six-well plate. one electrical pulse at 450 V, 50 F was given using a bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator. Western blotting Protein samples were prepared from cells harvested at 12 hours post-transfection. membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-IBV S polyclonal antibodies or mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich) and then with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (DAKO) the full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion) the full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion) all constructs were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikchangeTM kit (Stratagene) all constructs were confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing. cell-cell fusion activity is essential for selection and adaptation of coronavirus IBV from chicken embryo to cultured cells. fusion of transfected cells was detected by Western blot analysis of cells expressing IBV N (lane 1), S(EP3) (lane 2) and S(CK) constructs. white dots indicate the identified amino acid positions that affect the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein. protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-IBV S and anti-IBV-N polyclonal antibodies. the same membrane was also probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody as a loading control. expressing S(EP3) (panel B) and 2.93% (3.5\u20130.57) cells expressing S(CK) showed positive staining. 10.38% (12.51\u20132.13) of cells expressing S(EP3) protein (panel E) and 18.31% (20.44\u20132.13) of cells expressing S(CK) (panel F) showed positive staining. fusion activities of these S constructs were semi-quantitatively defined by comparing the average size of syncytia induced by different S constructs with the average size of cells expressing S(EP3). the region between amino acids 750 and 882 may determine the fusogenic difference between S(EP3) and S(CK). CK3(S826-N) and CK(F857-L) were made by mutation of the S826 and F857 residues in S(CK) to N and L, respectively. western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the S1 and S2 species as well as the full-length forms. expression levels of both mutants were lower than wild type constructs. expression levels of both mutants were lower than wild type constructs. mutations of L857 to Y and S exhibited similar effect on cell\u2013cell fusion. mutant constructs are EP3(L857-Y)>EP3(L857-S)>EP3(L857-E)>EP3(L857-I) = EP3(L857-E)>EP3(L857-I) = EP3(L857-K)>EP3. mutation was then introduced back to the genome of vero-adapted IBV. two clones contain a T773-S substitution (FLv1), one contains an I769-V substitution (FLv2) and two contain Q523-L and I769-V substitutions (FLv3). the recovered FL mutant virus from p0 contains a mixed population of quasispecies. the dominant clones contain an additional proline to serine substitution at amino acid position 327 (FLv4) compared to wild type IBV, rIBV showed similar growth kinetics in Vero cells. rIBV formed slighlty smaller plaques (Fig. 4a) with lower expression level of S protein. vero cells harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 48 hours post-infection. viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-IBV S antibodies. same membrane was probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody as loading control. cell fusion activities of these S constructs are FLv4>FLv3>FLv2EP3 = FL = FLv1. western blot analysis of cells expressing L857-containign S constructs. cells were harvested at 12 hours post-transfection and lysates prepared. mutants showed a weak cell\u2013cell fusion activity in Vero cells. the relative cell\u2013cell fusion activities of these S constructs are FL(Q523-L) = FLv2EP3(Q523-L)>EP3(I769-V)>EP3. further enhancement of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein and adaptation of IBV to cell culture by G405-D substitution Vero-adapted IBV gradually increased its infectivity in Vero cells by 405-D mutation into S(CK) drastically enhanced its cell\u2013cell fusion activity. the relative cell\u2013cell fusion activities of these S constructs are CK(G405-D)>p65>CKp7>EP3(G405-D)>EP3. s, S(EP3) and S(CK) cloned from EP3 and CK-adapted IBV strains, respectively, showed amino acid substitutions at 31 positions. western blot analysis showed the presence of major forms of S protein, including the cleaved S1 and S2 species (S1/S2) in cells expressing the two constructs. black dots indicate amino acid positions that affect cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein in this study. a. Western blot analysis of cells expressing IBV N (lane 1), S(EP3) (lane 2) and S(CK) constructs. cells were stained directly with 1100 diluted rabbit anti-IBV S polyclonal antibodies (panels A, B and C) or permeabilized with 0.1% saporin following by staining with the same antibodies (panels D, E and F) the cells were then incubated with 120 diluted FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody, fixed with 1% ice cold paraformaldehyde. acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S(CK) by mutation of a conserved leucine residue to phenylalanine (L857-F) in heptad repeat 1 region of S protein. three chimeric constructs were first made to map the amino acid mutation(s) responsible for acquisition of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S(CK) the region between amino acids 750 and 882 may determine the fusogenic difference between S(EP3) and S(CK) three mutant constructs were made to determine which amino acid substitution dictates the fusogenic change. Western blot analysis of cells expressing these constructs detected the S1 and S2 species as well as the full-length forms. immunofluorescent staining showed formation of syncytia in cells expressing CK(S826-N), suggesting that mutation of S836 to N did not affect the cell\u2013cell activity of S(CK) expression levels of both mutants were lower than wild type constructs. p65>p7EP3 = p7(F857-L) = p65(F857-L) no significant difference in the S1/S2 cleavage was observed. in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts derived from wild type and mutant clones were introduced into vero cells by electroporation. at 3 days post-electroporation, syncytia formation was clearly observed in cells electroporated with wild type transcripts. recombinant wild type and mutant viruses (p0) were recovered from the culture media at 3 and 6 days post-electroporation. rIBV showed similar growth kinetics in Vero cells compared to wild type IBV. rIBV showed similar growth kinetics in vero cells. the FLv4 mutant virus formed similar-sized plaques as rIBV. the mutant virus produced up to 10-fold higher titers of virus, compared to rIBV. the same membrane was probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody. the same membrane was also probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody as a loading control. cells were harvested at 12 hours post-transfection and lysates prepared. the viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-IBV S antibodies. the same membrane was also probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody. further enhancement of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of S protein and adaptation of IBV to cell culture by G405-D substitution Vero-adapted IBV gradually increased its infectivity in Vero cells by serial passages. a significant difference between p7 and p65 was observed. western blot analysis of cells expressing S(EP3), S(CK), S(p7), S(p65), and S(CK(G405D)) constructs. vero cells were infected with vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus and transfected with the indicated constructs. this phenomenon would lie on the rapid adaptation of certain viruses to a changing environment through selection of minor variants from quasispecies. acquisition and enhancement of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the S protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of IBV. lian counterpart on vero cells could be used as a receptor for IBV at low affinity. binding of IBV to sialic acid was reported to be important for adaptation of the virus to human cells. acquisition of virus-cell/cell\u2013cell membrane fusion would be an essential step for successful selection/adaptation of virus to the new host cells. further enhancement of the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of IBV S protein was achieved by a single amino acid substitution (G405-D) in p65 virus. additional amino acid substitutions (Q523-L and I769-V) greatly enhanced the cell\u2013cell fusion activity of the L857-containig S protein and the infectivity of the recovered virus. dette-US strains CAC39114 and CAC39300 also belong to this group. late passages of vero-adapted IBV, including p36, p50 and p65, contain the additional G405-D amino acid substitution. also shown are the numbers of amino acid changes during each adaptation process. a conserved Leu residue was found at the equivalent position. it is worth mentioning that the cell\u2013cell fusion activities of different S constructs were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively determined in cells overexpressing individual S constructs using the vaccinia/T7 expression system."}
