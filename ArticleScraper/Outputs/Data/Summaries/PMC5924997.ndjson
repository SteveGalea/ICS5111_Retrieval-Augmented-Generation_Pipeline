{"summary": "brucellosis is one of the most economically important zoonosis in the study of epidemiology. in low-income countries, brucellosis is endemic and neglected. in low-income countries, brucellosis is endemic and neglected. for the first time to our knowledge, we identify and analyze the citation classics for brucellosis. materials and methods Two electronic databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) were searched for the 50 most cited articles using the keyword \u201cbrucell\u201d for the search in Scopus, we selected the \u201ctitle, abstract, keyword\u201d choices. the list of the most cited articles found in the Scopus and WOS searches is shown in Table 1. of the total articles, 38 articles appeared in both databases within the highest 50 cited articles. among the highest 50 articles identified by the Scopus search, 12 (24%) articles were not among the highest 50 articles within the Scopus search. 2005 Infect Immun Chain PS 8 8 586 Revised genome sequence of Brucella suis 1330. 1995 Clin Infect Dis Young EJ 10 390 309 Complications associated with brucellosis.

Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Seances de l Academie des Sciences Serie D as Comptes Rendus Biologies. articles with 21 (34%) articles, followed by France, 20 (32%), and Spain, 8 (13%). of the total articles, 17 (27.4%) were from multinational collaboration. at position 11, we find the first report of sequencing a vaccine strain (B. abortus S19) by Crasta et al. in 2008. the most recent article by Tae et al. in 2011 reported on the resequencing of B. suis. at position 38, Foster et al. in 2007 studied small, Gram-negative coccobacilli resembling Brucella bacterial strains. the assay by Romero et al. was taken up more widely. at position 13, Schurig et al. produced a live attenuated RB51 strain for vaccination. the vaccine has become one of the most commonly used vaccines. the VirB system interacts with components of the endoplasmic reticulum, neutralising the pH and allowing the Brucella to undergo regulated cell division. other classics that further explored this system include Celli et al. in 2003 (position 16), Comerci et al. in 2001 (position 31), Boschiroli et al. in 2002 (position 34), Sieira et al. in 2000 (position 40), Kohler et al. in 2002 (position the list of classics did not include any article on brucellosis outbreaks. in both databases, the highest cited article on brucellosis was \"Canine Brucellosis: Outbreaks and Compliance, Theriogenology, 2006\" in both databases, the highest cited article on brucellosis was \"Canine Brucellosis: Outbreaks and Compliance, Theriogenology, 2006\" a combined search for the word \"brucell\" and the journals \"Veterinary Research\" and \"Journal of Bacteriology\" yielded 20 and 25 papers, respectively. the same search in the journals \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" and \"Journal of Bacteriology\" yielded 52 and 237 papers, respectively. brucellosis was discovered in 1887 and it is possible that some important studies were not indexed in current database but their findings are now considered well known. despite these limitations, the study provides a picture for the main cited articles in brucellosis research publications since the discovery of Brucella 130 years ago."}
