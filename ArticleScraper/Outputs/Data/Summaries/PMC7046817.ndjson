{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Avian coronavirus is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (1\u20133). since the first identification of IBV in the 1930s in the united states, more than 20 different serotypes and variants have been identified worldwide (4, 5) in 2007 and 2008, an outbreak of bronchitis in broilers in North Georgia led to the identification of a new strain designated GA08 next-generation paired-end sequencing (2 250 bp) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the 500-cycle miSeq reagent kit v2 (Illumina, USA) the genome consensus of the isolate, designated GA/1476/2015, was called from 36,893 IBV reads using BWA-MEM (14). this resulted in a median read depth coverage of 141 reads. genome sequences showed the highest nucleotide identity to the Arkansas strain ArkDPI11 (GenBank accession number EU418976) the analysis involved 22 nucleotide sequences (a sequence from the GI-9 lineage is included as an outgroup) the analysis involved 22 nucleotide sequences (a sequence from the GI-9 lineage is included as an outgroup) the complete genome sequence of the Avian coronavirus GA/1476/2015 isolate of the GA08 strain has been deposited in GenBank under accession number MN599049. raw data were deposited under SRA accession number SRR10742650, BioSample number SAMN13088878, and BioProject number PRJNA556282."}
