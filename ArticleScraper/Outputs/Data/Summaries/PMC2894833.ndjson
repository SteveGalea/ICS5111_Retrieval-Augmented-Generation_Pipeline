{"summary": "a dynamic statistical model was applied to historic dengue fever data. the duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. the distribution of the onset-to-confirmation time was different from that of the negative cases. an epidemic of dengue fever occurs every year in southern Taiwan. in 2002 there was a large-scale epidemic with 5,388 confirmed cases out of totally 15,221 suspect cases [16]. this epidemic continued until March 2003. a new method will be applied to dengue fever in Taiwan. there are almost no dengue fever cases occurred during the winter. the data come from the dengue notification dataset containing suspect cases in Taiwan whose date of onset was from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. the OC-time for positive and negative cases was shorter than that for negative cases. the standard deviations of the OC-time for positive cases and negative cases were also different. the epidemic started in the late June of 2006, and had a peak around October to November. the probability Pi(c) is estimated for unconfirmed cases using information from the confirmed cases before date c within one year. the probability Pi(c) is given by: (3) The ti(c) is the OC-time for confirmed cases and the censored OC-time for unconfirmed cases. the values of and were estimated and solved by setting up the sample mean and the sample variance of the OC-time equal to and 2, respectively. both the parametric and nonparametric models were based on the data within a 1-year \"moving window\" before date c. the data come from the dengue notification dataset containing suspect cases in Taiwan whose date of onset was from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. the data came from the dengue notification dataset containing suspect cases in Taiwan whose date of onset was from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. c is the \"current\" date when the number of dengue cases is to be estimated. the ith reported suspect case counting from the 1st day of the epidemic season. summing the Ei(c)over all new suspect cases on date c, and cumulative cases can be obtained by summing the Ei(c)over all cases from i = 1 to the newest suspect cases on date c. the probability Pi(c) is estimated for unconfirmed cases using information from the confirmed cases before date c within one year. a nonparametric approach was performed in which the probability P(T >ti(c)|Yi was simply replaced with the cumulative proportion of confirmed data given their final status. both parametric and nonparametric models were based on the data within a 1-year \"moving window\" before date c. summing the Ei(c)over all new suspect cases can be obtained by summing the Ei(c)over all new suspect cases on date c. the probability Pi(c) is estimated for unconfirmed cases using information from the confirmed cases before date c within one year before the date c. gamma distribution is denoted by with two parameters, the shape parameter and the scale parameter. the mean and variance of the OC-time were different between positive and negative cases. a nonparametric approach was performed in which the probability P(T >ti(c)|Yi) was simply replaced with the cumulative proportion of confirmed data given their final status. arbitrary view dates of august 1, 2006 (beginning of the epidemic), September 1, 2006 (rising stage, before the peak), October 1, 2006 (rising stage, before but closer the peak) and January 1, 2007 (end of the epidemic) were chosen to illustrate the results of the estimated daily new cases. daily new cases did not give an accurate estimate towards the end stage of the epidemic, namely when viewed on January 1, 2007. Figure 2. Dynamic epidemic curves (daily new cases) within 3 weeks before the view date. in this figure, the cumulative number of positive cases was updated every day. the first confirmed positive dengue case appeared on July 6, 2006. an ARB closer to zero is a more accurate estimate. the parameter estimates varied from day to day. the proposed method dynamically updates the parameters daily by making use of the most recent available information on suspect cases. the actual daily number of infected cases and cumulative positive cases are potentially underestimated when an infectious disease required a time-consuming process for diagnosis. the difference between the gamma and the nonparametric method is only slight. the difference between the gamma and the nonparametric method is again only slight. the difference between the gamma and the nonparametric method is again only slight. the proposed method worked well after the first positive case appeared during the 2006-2007 season. in the 2006-2007 season, the Taiwan CDC activated a central command center for intensively dengue epidemic control on October 2. the task of this command center included expanded blood sample collection. the nonparametric method estimates by plugging in the cumulative proportion of confirmed data given the final status. 134 and 289 cases missing confirmation results for the 2005-2006 season and 2006-2007 season respectively. the nonparametric method estimates by plugging in the cumulative proportion of confirmed data given the final status. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions IFL designed and conducted the study, and finalized the manuscript. authors have read and approved the final manuscript."}
