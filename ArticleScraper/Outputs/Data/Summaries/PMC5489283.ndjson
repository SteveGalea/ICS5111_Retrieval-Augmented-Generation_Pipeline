{"summary": "flumist\u00ae, a live-attenuated influenza virus vaccine, was approved for seasonal use in Canadians 2\u201359 y of age in June 2010. in canada, LAIV is currently recommended for use in children and adolescents 2\u201317 y old, including non-immunosuppressed individuals. CF is characterized by, among other things, abnormal inflammatory responses to viral respiratory infections,15 16 and chronic inflammation of the lungs and airways. both characteristics can impact the incidence and course of viral infections, making this patient population of particular interest when evaluating viral interference. 76 subjects (59 with CF) attending the 2 participating CF clinics were enrolled and vaccinated with LAIV between October 8-November 28, 2013. 24 subjects had RT-PCR detected influenza B virus RNA only, 7 had influenza A virus RNA detected only and 21 subjects had both virus types detected at least once throughout follow up. results were not stratified by influenza type given the small number of subjects. the prevalence of detected NIRV on D0 was greater in subjects with CF compared with healthy subjects. fewer participants had detectable influenza RNA during follow-up compared with those that did not have an NIRV at baseline. this difference was not statistically significant (59% vs. 75%; RD = 16% 95% CrI: 7, 39%) compared with 44 episodes in the 39 D0-NIRV-negative subjects. this corresponds to 0.27 detection episodes/day in the NIRV-positive group. peak detection of influenza RNA in subjects that tested positive for a NIRV on D0 occurred later (peak at D4) than non-NIRV-infected subjects (peak at D1), regardless of CF status. nnon-CF, D0-NIRV+ = 4, nnon-CF, D0-NIRV- = 13) Detection Duration Positive (n = 22) Negative (n = 52) Difference (95% CrI) Subjects with any influenza virus detected throughout follow-up, % (n/N) 59% (13/22) 75% (39/52) 16% (7, 39) Total detection episodes* 14 44 30 (15, 45) Duration 9 15 6 (3, 16) Two consecutive the RD estimate was robust to potential information bias from the diagnostic assays used to detect the presence of respiratory viruses. a slightly larger proportion of negative participants had influenza RNA detected following vaccination compared with those who were positive for NIRV. this moderate trend was observed when the duration of the detection episodes was compared between both groups. a large degree of bias in the overall RD estimate was not observed when potential misclassification of D0-NIRV status and influenza detection status during follow-up was taken into account. a large error rate was assumed from the literature for only the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay used to ascertain exposure (xTAG\u00ae) this is the first study conducted evaluating viral interference, a controversial topic in the realm of live-attenuated vaccines in a pediatric cohort with CF. this is the first study conducted evaluating viral interference, a controversial and understudied topic in the realm of live-attenuated vaccines. study population Individuals 2 to 19 y of age with CF that had no contraindication to LAIV18 were recruited for a prospective cohort study. subjects were followed in either one of 2 participating CF clinics in Canada. participants' siblings were also recruited if they had no chronic health conditions, respiratory or other (hereby referred to as \u2018healthy\u2019). all diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses was performed at the Laboratoire de Sant\u00e9 Publique du Qu\u00e9bec. samples were tested for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (H1, H3 and 2009 H1N1 subtypes), influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus (types 1, 2, 3 and 4), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus (NL63 the human enzyme ribonuclease P gene was used as an internal positive control for the RT-PCR assays to determine the presence of human nucleic acids. the human enzyme ribonuclease P (RNP) gene was used as an internal positive control for the RT-PCR assays to determine the presence of human nucleic acids. study population Individuals 2 to 19 y of age with CF that had no contraindication to LAIV18 were recruited for a prospective cohort study. participants were vaccinated as part of their regular process of care between October 8 and November 28, 2013, before the influenza season began. swabs were placed in 2.0 mL of universal transport medium (Copan) after specimen procurement and then kept in home freezers and delivered frozen to the hospital sites. all diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses was performed at the Laboratoire de Sant\u00e9 Publique du Qu\u00e9bec. Specimens with Ct values higher than 37 in the first RT-PCR run were considered positive even if the Ct values obtained were >37 (upper bound of 40) the human enzyme ribonuclease P gene was used as an internal positive control for the RT-PCR assays to determine presence of human nucleic acids. the xTAG\u00ae assay used for the identification of a D0-NIRV (exposure) and RT-PCR assays used for the detection of influenza RNA (outcome) are subject to a degree of inaccuracy. misclassification of D0-NIRV infections and of influenza RNA detection during follow-up may bias the estimated RD. most analyses do not account for this potential bias. funding from GSK and Pfizer as investigator-initiated research grants, was reimbursed travel expenses to attend a ad hoc advisory committee and received honorarium from the Ontario Nurse Association."}
