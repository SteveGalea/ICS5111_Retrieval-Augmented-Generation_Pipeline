{"summary": "cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is involved in the production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. CF is a multisystem disease and influences many body parts, such as lung, pancrea, liver, kidney, and intestine. it is considered one of the most widespread genetic disorders shortening human life expectancy. fungi are detected in a large number of CF patients, including aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus terreus, and Scedosporium species for filamentous fungi. some studies show that about a third of CF exacerbations are associated with viruses infection. variant ecological viewpoints and methods could be used to study the lung microbial community and its changes. this is our choice to revealing the influence of CF on lung microbial community in this study. dataset description Fodor et al collected spontaneous expectorated sputum samples from 23 adult CF patients at 2 time points, one of which is the beginning of an acute exacerbation, and another is after antibiotic treatment for the exacerbation. the average number of sequences per sample was approximately 4300. the equation is given as follows: where, J represents the number of individuals in the community, a expresses the number of species with abundance a, and ni is the abundance of the species I. if a community satisfies the neutral prediction, species in this community must have dispersal limitation. the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the likelihood of each artificial dataset (L0) and corresponding observed sample (L1) the microbial community is considered to satisfy the prediction of neutral theory. the dataset we used to test the neutral theory was from a study performed by Fodor et al. formula was put forward by Warren Ewens in 1972 for calculating the likelihood of the presence of an ecological community consisting of S species with abundance of n1, n2, n3... ns. the equation is given as follows: where, J represents the number of individuals in the metacommunity, a expresses the number of species with abundance a, and ni is the abundance of the species I. the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the likelihood of the artificial dataset (L0) and corresponding observed sample (L1) if no significant difference was found (P value >.5), the microbial community is considered to satisfy the prediction of neutral theory. neutral theory testing with sputum microbiome using Etienne sampling formula. 3.2. Change of diversity and neutrality after antibiotic treatment. 4.407 and 4.825 respectively. q-value represents the difference of likelihoods in the observed and simulated microbial communities, which is defined as the P value. in most cases in the Etienne result, the immigrate rate m is very close to 1, indicating that the dispersal limitation is not in effect for most samples. there is significant difference between 2 groups (P value =.041), suggesting antibiotic treatment could significantly decrease the biodiversity of lung microbial community. no one sample was found to satisfy the prediction of neutral theory. paganin et al[20] found that changes of microbial community in CF airway were relevant to a severe decline of lung function. cuthbertson et al[21] suggested that core microbiota members did not have significant negative impact on the CFPE. in CF patients, the stable disease symptoms are disrupted by the episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation, and can change the composition of lung community significantly. in CF patients, the stable disease symptoms are disrupted by the episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation, and can change the composition of lung community significantly. the mean value of in end-of-treatment is slightly lower than Exacerbation Group. the P value is very close to.05, which indicates that the significance is not so strong. this result raises another key question: whether or not the mechanism of assembly of lung microbial community would change back to the state in healthy lung. microbial community related to CF better related to CF better."}
