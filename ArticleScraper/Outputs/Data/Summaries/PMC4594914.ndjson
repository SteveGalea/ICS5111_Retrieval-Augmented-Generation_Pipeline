{"summary": "PEDV is an enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirale, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus. it caused widespread epidemics in several European countries during the 1970s and 1980s. since the 1990s PED has become rare in Europe with occasional outbreaks. real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) has been widely used for PEDV detection. however, correlations of PEDV infectious titers to the rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values have not been described. for PEDV, the success rate of virus isolation in cell culture has been quite low. the post-inoculation medium without virus was used as a negative control. multiple aliquots of each dilution were prepared and stored at -80\u00b0C. quantification of these virus dilutions and inoculation into pigs could be performed under the same number of freeze/thaw cycles. each sample was serially 10-fold diluted in post-inoculation media. each sample was inoculated into vero cells grown in 96-well plates. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. quantitative real-time RT-PCR for PEDV A PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene-based real-time RT-PCR was previously developed at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. a fragment covering the PEDV N gene-based RT-PCR products (nucleotide positions 26,679\u201326,885 of the PEDV USA/IN19338/2013, GenBank # KF650371) was cloned into the plasm the linearized DNA was subject to run-off in vitro transcription into RNA using a MEGAshortscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit (thermo Fisher Scientific) the in vitro transcribed RNA was serially diluted in nuclease-free water and used as standards in the PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR to generate standard curves. pigs were randomized by weight into 7 groups of 4 pigs each, one room per group. pigs were fed a mixture of Esbilac liquid milk replacer and yogurt. each divided portion of tub had dedicated water sources. pigs with severe clinical signs were euthanized and necropsied at 4 DPI. a portion of the three sections of jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.

were orogastrically inoculated with 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 dilutions of the PEDV stock and the virus-negative cell culture media. three representative villi and crypts with integrated longitudinal sections were randomly selected from ileum of each pig for measurement of villus heights and crypt depths. serial sections of ileums were evaluated for PEDV antigen by immunohistochemistry using a PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody. 5120 in PBS, 100l of each diluted serum was added to each well. 60l/well of 1:50 diluted goat anti-swine IgG antibody conjugated with FITC was added to each well. plates were rinsed twice with distilled water and cell staining was examined. whole virus-based ELISA was developed and validated at the ISU VDL for detection of PEDV-specific IgG antibody. each batch of one liter of PEDV propagated in Vero cells were subjected to one freeze-thaw and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 15 min. the virus pellet was then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 140,992 g for 3 h. 100l of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) antibody was added to each well. plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h and then washed 5 times with PBS. a virus stock at the 7th passage in cell culture was prepared and used in this study. the virus stock was 10-fold serially diluted in post-inoculation media. the post-inoculation medium without virus was used as a negative control. virus stock and serial dilutions were back titrated in vero cells. each sample was serially 10-fold diluted in post-inoculation media. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. inoculation media supplemented with 0.75% carboxymethyl cellulose was added to each well. plates were incubated undisturbed at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 days. wells containing 20\u2013200 plaques were counted and titers expressed as PFU/ml. the plasmids were transformed into one Shot\u00ae TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells. the plasmid DNA was linearized with HindIII, treated with Proteinase K, purified with QIAquick\u00ae PCR purification kit. the linearized DNA was subject to run-off in vitro transcription into RNA using a MEGAshortscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit. pigs randomized by weight into 7 groups of 4 pigs each, one room per group. each divided portion of the tub had dedicated water sources. pigs were fed a mixture of Esbilac liquid milk replacer and yogurt. pigs in groups 1\u20137 were orogastrically inoculated with 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 dilutions of the PEDV stock and the virus-negative cell culture media. piglets were evaluated daily for clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and body condition. wabs and cecum contents were tested by aforementioned quantitative PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR. formalin-fixed jejunum and ileum were submitted to the ISU VDL. 22 27 >45 >45 15.44 9.96 13.06 X X 7 >45 >45 27.75 25.58 19.41 X X 29 >45 39.97 22.24 24.6 17.43 X X 28 >45 >45 20.64 21.05

assay, virus neutralization (VN) test, and a whole virus-based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. three representative villi and crypts with integrated longitudinal sections were randomly selected from each pig for measurement of villus heights and crypt depths. confluent Vero cells grown in 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 l/well of the U.S. PEDV prototype strain USA/IN19338/2013 at 1000 TCID50/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C, with 5% CO2. twenty four hours later, the inocula were removed and cells were fixed with cold 80% acetone for 10 min. 100l of the serum-virus mixture (containing 200 TCID50 of virus) was transferred to 96-well plates with a Vero cell monolayer. cells were fixed with cold 80% acetone and stained with PEDV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody SD6-29 conjugated to FITC (Medgene, Brookings, South Dakota) plates were washed 5 times, blocked (300l/well) with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. plates were dried at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and stored at 4\u00b0C in a sealed bag. villus height, crypt depth, and villus/crypt ratio were compared with a generalized linear mixed (GLIMMIX) model. all tests were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test. each virus dilution was tested in triplicate by a quantitative PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR. the virus stock had an average Ct of 12.2 and the Ct values increased by roughly 3\u20134 for every 10-fold dilution until the 107 dilution that had a Ct value of 37.62. this range of Ct values correlated to 2.11010 genomic copies/ml in the virus stock through 689 genomic copies/ml in the 107 3 pigs in group 6 inoculated with virus dilution 108 and all 4 pigs in negative control group remained active and clinically unaffected throughout the 7-day study period. one pig (pig ID 9) in group 6 (108 dilution) shed virus in rectal swabs starting from 3 DPI. pigs in groups 1\u20135 (103\u2013107 dilutions) were all necropsied at 4 DPI. there were no significant differences between groups in villus height, crypt depth, villus/crypt ratio, or IHC scores. only one pig (ID 9) from group 6 was necropsied at 4 DPI. pigs in group 6 (IDs 23, 13 and 8) and group 7 (negative control) decreased villus heights, increased crypt depth, and lower villus/crypt ratios. but statistical differences were not analyzed because they were necropsied at different DPI. infection outcomes in 3-week-old pigs In groups 1\u20133 (103 to 105 dilutions), 1/6, 1/6, and 6/6 pigs developed mild diarrhea at 2, 3, and 4\u20137 DPI. mild dehydration or lethargy was observed in pigs in groups 4\u20137 (106 to 108 dilutions and negative control) throughout the duration of the study. pigs in group 2 (104 dilution) had a peak virus shedding during 10\u201314 DPI. all rectal swabs from pigs in groups 4\u20137 (106 to 108 dilutions and negative control) were negative by PEDV PCR through the study period. 32.68 34.18 30.13 32.26 35.07 24.21 14.46 34.12 >45 >45 >45 33.44 33.92 31.83 32.25 30.72 15.70 29.83 36.08

and whole virus-based ELISA assays and then remained through 28 DPI. PEDV neutralizing antibodies was first detected by VN test at 7 DPI in 1/3 pigs of groups 1 and 2. the stock virus and 101 to 104 dilutions all had the same logarithms of titers as the theoretical titers based on the dilution factor. the 105 virus dilution had an infectious titer of 5 PFU/ml. each virus dilution was also tested in triplicate by a quantitative PEDV N gene-based rRT-PCR. infection outcomes in 5-day-old piglets All four 5-day-old piglets in the groups 1 to 5 (inoculated with virus dilutions 103 to 107) and one pig (pig ID 9) in group 6 (inoculated with virus dilution 108) developed mild to watery diarrhea at 1 DPI and diarrhea lasted through the study period. vomiting was only observed in piglets inoculated with the 103 dilution (5.62 the average virus shedding in groups 1\u20135 (103 to 107 dilutions) at 2\u20134 DPI and virus shedding in pig ID 9 from group 6 at 3\u20134 DPI were similar, having 107.6 to 109.2 genomic copies/ml. all rectal swabs from the 3 unaffected pigs (IDs 23, 13 and 8) were negative by PEDV PCR. the results were consistent with those of the rectal swabs collected s were calculated, and the magnitude of IHC staining was scored and compared on ileums of different groups. only one pig (ID 9) from group 6 was necropsied at 4 DPI. villus height, crypt depth, villus/crypt ratio, or IHC scores were not significantly different from each other. 5 N = 4 272.19 22.03 162.21 9.71 1.67 0.04 3.88 0.13 4 106 N = 4 230.85 19.33 152.46 4.52 1.51 0.12 3.63 0.24 5 107 N = 4 228.18 33.57 158.24 10.89 1.45 0.21 3.94 0.06 6* 108 N = 1 222.49 143.12 1.55 4.00 Necropsy at 7 DPI 6 108 N = 3 423.17 51. all pigs in groups 1\u20133 were PEDV PCR positive by 4 DPI. most of the remaining pigs in groups 1\u20133 continued to shed virus in rectal swabs during 10\u201321 DPI. but all pigs in these groups ceased shedding virus at 28 DPI. 87 29.42 31.10 32.94 33.30 >45 >45 66 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 32.09 19.24 19.72 15.62 19.17 34.60 35.21 36.71 >45 89 >45 >45 24.00 16.66 20.13 15.04 20.08 22.26 35.33 37.94 >45 >45 3 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 27.50 24.34 20.99 19.13 26.88 X X 86 17.87 34.13 33.42 >45 >45 2 >45 >45 >45 >45 37.58 33.87 31.46 42.98 35.07 X X X 78 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 >45 > for pigs necropsied at 7 DPI, microscopic lesions consistent with viral infection were observed in 2/3 pigs of group 1 (103 dilution), 1/3 pigs of group 2 (104 dilution), 1/3 pigs of group 3 (105 dilution), and 0/3 pigs of groups 4\u20137. villus heights, crypt depths, villus/crypt ratios of pigs in all groups 1\u20137 were not significantly ELISA antibody titers (C) were shown for 3 pigs in each group that went through 28 days post inoculation. a U.S. PEDV prototype strain cell culture isolate USA/IN19338/2013 was 10-fold serially diluted and tested in this study. in 5-day-old and 3-week-old nave conventional pigs, 100% of pigs (4/4 pigs) became infected with 10ml of inoculum having titers 560\u20135.6 TCID50/ml. 25% of pigs (1/4 pigs) became infected with 10ml of inoculum having titer 0.0056 TCID50/ml (Ct>45) in 3-week-old pigs, 10 the MID of PEDV was 56 TCID50 in 3-week-old pigs. this suggests that the MID for neonatal and weaned pigs is 1000-fold lower than it is in weaned pigs. five-day-old piglets in this study were fed a mixture of liquid milk replacer and yogurt, possibly devoid of IgG, IgA and other immunologic ingredients found in sow milk. piglets raised under the current study conditions could be more susceptible to PEDV infection than piglets at the corresponding ages that were naturally nursed by sows. neonatal pigs have low numbers of LGR5+ cells and low levels of Ki67 staining. success rate of PEDV isolation in cell culture has been low. pig bioassay is more sensitive than weaned pig bioassay. the effect of PEDV infectious doses on infection outcomes was evaluated in nave conventional neonatal and weaned pigs. it must be noted that infectious dose effects in previously exposed or vaccinated pigs may be different from nave pigs."}
