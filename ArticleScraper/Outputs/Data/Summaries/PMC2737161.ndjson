{"summary": "c-di-GMP is a potent cytosolic inducer of type I IFNs. we compared the ability of overlayed versus transfected c-di-GMP to induce type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages. c-di-GMP is a potent cytosolic inducer of type I IFNs. c-di-GMP, treated or untreated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, was transfected at 3.3 g/ml into B6 bone marrow macrophages. c-di-GMP, treated or untreated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, was transfected at 3.3 g/ml into B6 bone marrow macrophages. each dot represents a single gene, and its position is determined by its induction in response to DNA (x axis) or c-di-GMP (y axis) most genes lie on the diagonal, indicative of similar induction ratios by both treatments. phosphodiesterase treatment of c-di-GMP resulted in a product that is no longer stimulatory. c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol, resulting in a potent induction of type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages. c-di-GMP signals independently of cytosolic DNA. HEK293 cells stably transfected with various TLRs failed to respond to c-di-GMP. but the reason for this failure was unclear. we tested responses in Myd88/Trif/double-knockout macrophages. Tbk1 deficiency is embryonic lethal, but viability can be rescued on the TNF receptor 1 (Tnfr1)\u2013deficient background. as in A, except Irf3/ and Irf7/ macrophages were analyzed. we tested c-di-GMP responses in macrophages lacking Irf3. we observed very little IFN- induction by c-di-GMP in cells lacking Tbk1. we also observed that Tbk1 is required for the induction of IFN- by pdA:dT. c-di-GMP activates IRF3, NF-B, and MAP kinases. c-di-GMP activates IRF3, NF-B, and MAP kinases. c-di-GMP activates phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation. c-di-GMP resulted in significant translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus. host transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B are induced by c-di-GMP. independent experiments. Data are means SD (n = 3) compared with unstimulated cells. we also tested whether transfected c-di-GMP is capable of activating NF-B. c-di-GMP failed to activate NF-B. transfected c-di-GMP is capable of activating NF-B. the relatively low levels and late time course of NF-B induction by c-di-GMP may explain why NF-B induction was not previously observed in response to c-di-GMP. we also tested whether MAP kinase pathways are activated by c-di-GMP. c-di-GMP is composed of two guanosine ribonucleotides (not deoxyribonucleotides) in an unusual cyclic conformation. c-di-GMP also lacks features consistent with recognition by RIG-I or Mda5. c-di-GMP is an essential adapter protein in the cytosolic RNA pathway leading to type I IFN induction. c-di-GMP signals through the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway are not required for responses to c-di-GMP. c-di-GMP does not stimulate known cytosolic pathways for sensing nucleic acids. c-di-GMP does not stimulate known cytosolic pathways for sensing nucleic acids. bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages from Zbp1-deficient mice still responded to c-di-GMP. however, as previously reported, Zbp1-deficient macrophages also responded normally to DNA. c-di-GMP signals through IRF3 and IRF7 in vivo. NK cells obtained from Irf3/7/ mice stimulated with c-di-GMP responded to YAC-1 cells, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-. c-di-GMP activates IRF3/7-dependent responses in vivo. serum albumin was collected from immunized mice 2 wk after a single intraperitoneal injection. mice injected with HSA plus c-di-GMP produced variable but significant titers of HSA-specific IgG1 antibodies. c-di-GMP can function as an adjuvant in vivo. c-di-GMP is a potent cytosolic inducer of type I IFNs. a significant response was detected with a concentration of c-di-GMP as low as 2.5 g/ml. c-di-GMP signals via a cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway. transcription of the IFN- gene (Ifnb) was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. n.d., not detectably induced above background (lipofectamine alone) c-di-GMP, treated or untreated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, was transfected at 3.3 g/ml into B6 bone marrow macrophages. two independent microarray experiments gave similar results. we measured induction of endogenous type I IFN protein by bioassay. no detectable IFN- production was observed upon transfection with c-di-GMP. cytosolic c-di-GMP and DNA induce similar transcriptional responses. a small number of genes were reproducibly preferentially induced by c-di-GMP as compared with DNA. c-di-GMP signals independently of TLRs. both wild-type and Myd88/Trif/ macrophages showed a robust induction of IFN- after c-di-GMP stimulation. the results indicated that TLR signaling is not required for responsiveness to c-di-GMP, and are consistent with c-di-GMP signaling via a cytosolic surveillance pathway. Irf5/ and Irf1/ macrophages were analyzed. results represent at least three independent experiments. we tested the ability of c-di-GMP to induce signaling in macrophages lacking Irf3. the partial requirement for Irf7 may reflect a role for Irf7 signaling as part of a positive feedback loop involving signaling through the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar) chemokine Rantes was induced by c-di-GMP in a manner dependent on Tbk1, Irf3 and Ifnar. c-di-GMP activates IRF3, NF-B, and MAP kinases. c-di-GMP resulted in significant nuclear accumulation of IRF3. nuclear extracts from Myd88/Trif/ macrophages stimulated for indicated times with c-di-GMP, poly dA:dT (pdA:dT, DNA) or poly I:C (pI:C, RNA) were probed with the indicated antibodies. results are representative of at least three independent experiments. c-di-GMP treatment led to the activation of NF-B. the probe-bound complex was confirmed to contain NF-B p65 by supershifting with an anti-p65 antibody. the subtle difference in NF-B induction between cytosolic DNA and c-di-GMP may suggest that there are distinct signaling components upstream of NF-B in the two pathways. cytosolic c-di-GMP stimulated p38, ERK1/2, and JNK phosphorylation in mouse macrophages transfected with c-di-GMP. c-di-GMP is composed of two guanosine ribonucleotides in an unusual cyclic conformation. P lacks features consistent with recognition by RIG-I or Mda5, such as 5\u2032-triphosphate, polyuridine, or double strandedness. in addition to bone marrow macrophages, we observed induction of IFN- by cytosolic c-di-GMP in other cell types. GM-CSF\u2013differentiated dendritic cells were stimulated as in A. SeV. RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells were stimulated as in A. (E) 293T cells were stimulated as in A. (F) c-di-GMP does not stimulate known cytosolic pathways for sensing nucleic acids. mavs/ and littermate wild-type macrophages were transfected with 3.3 g/ml c-di-GMP, poly dA:dT (pdA:dT, DNA) and transcription of the IFN- gene (Ifnb) was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. c-di-GMP signals through IRF3 and IRF7 in vivo. mice injected with c-di-GMP produced an IFN response to c-di-GMP. single-deficient Irf3/ mice responded to c-di-GMP in vivo. c-di-GMP activates IRF3/7-dependent responses in vivo. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 nmol c-di-GMP. splenic NK responsiveness to target cells was measured ex vivo. c-di-GMP produced variable but significant titers of HSA-specific IgG1 antibodies. antibody responses in Irf3/7/ mice immunized with HSA and c-di-GMP were significantly reduced as compared with immunized B6 mice. the mechanism by which c-di-GMP stimulates immune responses remains unclear. c-di-GMP provokes a transcriptional response reminiscent of that triggered by the cytosolic presence of DNA or RNA. c-di-GMP provokes a transcriptional response highly reminiscent of that triggered by the cytosolic presence of DNA or RNA. cytosolic sensing of c-di-GMP is relatively specific. c-di-GMP that was hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase did not induce type I IFNs. c-di-GMP triggers type I IFN expression indirectly. pathway downstream of c-di-GMP contains at least some novel components. bacterial pathogens have been reported to induce type I IFNs. in all cases, type I IFN induction is independent of myD88/Trif and TLRs. a strain lacking all c-di-GMP synthesis has not been reported. c-di-GMP plays important regulatory roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. c-di-GMP is a candidate for a conserved molecule unique to bacteria responsible for triggering transcription of type IFN genes. the potency of DNA vaccines appears to derive from their ability to stimulate the TBK1 and innate cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways. this suggests that c-di-GMP might have valuable application as a small-molecule adjuvant. c-di-GMP was synthesized as previously described. c-di-GMP was synthesized as previously described. bone marrow cells from femurs and tibias were cultured for 7 d in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS, glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% CSF from 3T3 cells. peritoneal macrophages were elicited by injection of 2 ml 4% thioglycollate (BD) and were obtained 4 d later by lavage of the peritoneal cavity with c-di-GMP was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in Optimem buffer (Invitrogen), with 15 mM MgCl2 and 1 U Phosphodiesterase I.
