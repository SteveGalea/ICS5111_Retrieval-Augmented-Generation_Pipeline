{"summary": "influenza A virus (FLUAV) infects a broad range of mammalian and avian hosts (1, 2). transmission of FLUAV from natural reservoirs to domestic hosts (poultry and pigs) routinely involves the mutation of viral genes, the exchange of genes between viruses during the process of reassortment, or both (3\u20135) pigs, susceptible to both avian and human influenza A viruses, function as mixing vessels. bats have been shown to harbor hepaciviruses, hepadnaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and pegiviruses. this may be the ancestors of the hepatitis C, hepatitis B, mumps, and GB viruses currently circulating in humans. the dominant contributors are the segments encoding the cell surface hemagglutinin (HA) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (1, 35, 36). HA mediates the attachment and entry of virions into cells by binding sialic acid moieties on the host cell surface. the viral neuraminidase protein also binds sialic acids, cleaving the glycan to facilitate release and prevent the self-aggregat a single mutation in the PB2 subunit, conversion of the avian signature glutamic acid residue at position 627 to the human signature lysine residue, is sufficient to overcome FLUAV restriction in human cells. a critical question is whether FLUAV can move back and forth between humans and bats and which barriers are faced in a heterotypic host. the findings highlight the importance of defining the full scope of mixing vessels and viral reservoirs that contribute to human disease.

Kawaoka [67]) titers of all viruses were determined in MDCK cells overlaid with medium containing 1.2% Avicel cellulose (RC-581; FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia, PA) Mutant viruses were confirmed by sequencing of cDNA derived from the viral genomes. single-cycle green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing WSN virus was rescued in HEK293T cells cotransfected with pCDNA6.2-HA, pPOLI-HA(45)GFP ( the percentage of GFP-positive cells was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. the other set of cells was trypsinized and transferred to round-bottom 96-well plates. PK(15), and Tb 1 Lu cells were performed at 37\u00b0C. infections in Calu-3 cells were performed at 33\u00b0C. the viral titers of aliquots taken throughout the infection were determined. Sequence reads were deconvoluted and trimmed using a quality limit threshold of 0.001. reads were mapped to full-length reference sequences from the cDNA clones used during the initial rescue of the parental virus. cell lines were derived from African (EidNi/41.3, EpoNi/22.1, HypLu/45.1, HypNi/1.1, R05T, R06E, RoNi/7.1, RoNi/7.2), American (B5L, Tb 1 Lu), and Eurasian (MyDauLu/47.1) bats. at least one of these cell lines (EidNi/41.3) is known to express type I interferon (74) bat cells were infected with virus at increasing MOIs of a single-cycle GFP reporter virus (A/WSN/33) after inoculation, the cells were imaged (bottom) and the percentage of infected cells was quantitated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (top). the influenza B virus (FLUBV) B/Brisbane/60/2008 also replicated in Tb 1 Lu cells. the multicycle replication kinetics of reassortants carrying ribonucleoprotein genes from primary human (NY312) or avian (S009) isolates in Tb 1 Lu cells (MOI = 0.1) are shown. the titers of the virus were 3 log units lower than those of the WSN and NY312 RNP viruses. this contrasts with the highly efficient replication of the S009 RNP virus in avian cells where the polymerase and host are matched (55), indicating that this virus is not generically impaired. the enzymatic activity of all heterotypic RdRPs with human FLUAV subunits was reduced by a factor of at least 1,000. only the avian S009 PB1 reassortant was marginally functional, retaining 5% the activity of the homotypic Guat164 RdRP. polymerase activity was reconstituted with RNP subunits from WSN, NY312, 1918, UT1, Udorn, or S009. heterotypic RdRPs were created by substituting components of the Guat164 RdRP. activity was reduced 20- to 1,000-fold compared to that of the homotypic RNPs. experimental adaptation of influenza A virus to replication in bat cells. two viruses, WSN and reassortant WSN carrying the avian S009 RNP, were evolved in parallel by blind passaging a 1:10 to 1:100 dilution of infected culture supernatant (MOI, 0.1) on fresh Tb1 Lu cells every 48 to 72 h for nine sequential rounds of infection. retraction due to trypsin present in virus growth medium (VGM) that was absent in control cells. experimental evolution of influenza A virus in bat cells increases virus replication and development of cytopathic effects. adapted virus induced severe cytopathic effects in Tb 1 Lu cells. the increased replication and cytotoxicity of the adapted viruses could result from changes to any stage of the viral life cycle. the increased replication and cytotoxicity of the adapted viruses could result from changes to any stage of the viral life cycle. adapted viruses were metabolically labeled after inoculation with either the parental or the adapted virus. experimental evolution of FLUAV in bat cells results in virus with increased replication, cytopathogenicity, and viral gene expression in cells from the selection host. phylogenetic analysis places the bat FLUAV genes as monophyletic outgroups to all other extant FLUAV genes. these genes diverged from those in the remaining FLUAV strains following the split from influenza B virus but before the diversification of FLUAV, suggesting an ancient origin of the bat viruses. adapted FLUAV isolatesd Virus Gene Variant allele (nt)a Mutation (aa) Frequency (%)b Bat allele (aa)c P0 P6 P9 WSN NS1 T251C V84A 0 10.4 9.0 Q85 WSN PA T854A M285K 0 65.6 77.6 M285 WSN PA A1187G D396G 0 65.0 78.3 D/E391 W cDNA clones used during the initial rescue of the parental virus. only variants detected at levels above the background are reported. most coded for amino acid residue changes that had not been previously associated with host adaptation. treatment with RDE prevented infection of Tb 1 Lu cells with the single-cycle GFP-WSN reporter virus. infection was unchanged in mock-treated cells (Fig. 5, No RDE) mutant viruses test role of PB2 627 mutations during virus replication in Tb 1 Lu cells. mutations at PB2 position 627 control replication ability in bat cells. mutations at PB2 position 627 control replication ability in bat cells. Adaptive mutations in the influenza A virus regulate replication in bat cells. deep sequencing of adapted viruses revealed high-frequency mutations in PB2, PA, and NP genes that were then introduced into recombinant viruses. the specified mutations were inserted alone or in combination into the parental WSN virus. titers were 1,000-fold lower than those of the bat-adapted virus. combining PA M285K with mutation NP S245G and/or PA D396G increased replication of these viruses. titers were within 5-fold of those of the bat-adapted virus. at least one of these cell lines (EidNi/41.3) is known to express type I interferon (74) all cell lines tested were susceptible to infection with GFP-WSN virus to some degree. the percentage of infected cells mostly increased with increasing MOI. bat cells were derived from Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tb 1 Lu), eastern pipistrelles (B5L), Daubenton's myotis bats (MyDauLu/47.1), Egyptian rousettes (R05T, R06E, RoNi/7.1, RoNi/7.2), B\u00fcttikofer's epauletted fruit bats (EpoNi/22.1), hammer-headed fruit bats (Hyp data represent mean titers SD (n = 3) determined by plaque assay. the FLUAV RdRP is a key determinant of host tropism and pathogenicity. the remaining genes were derived from the WSN strain. reassortment is often associated with an increasing host range and theemergence of pandemic viruses. the homotypic bat RNP containing subunits from avian and bat viruses is highly active in human cells. the enzymatic activity of all heterotypic RdRPs with human FLUAV subunits was reduced by a factor of at least 1,000. only the avian S009 PB1 reassortant was marginally functional, retaining 5% the activity of the homotypic Guat164 RdRP. activity for most of the reassortants was appreciably compromised. activity was reduced 20- to 1,000-fold compared to that of the homotypic RNPs. however, introducing guat164 PA into the restricted avian S009 RdRP increased the activity by 4-fold. two viruses, WSN and reassortant WSN carrying the avian S009 RNP, were evolved in parallel by blind passaging a 1:10 to 1:100 dilution of infected culture supernatant (MOI, 0.1) on fresh Tb1 Lu cells every 48 to 72 h for nine sequential rounds of infection. despite increasing titers, this reassorted virus did not achieve high levels detected for WSN virus. a reassortant virus carrying avian ribonucleoprotein genes (S009) was adapted to replication in Tb 1 Lu cells by serial blind passaging. cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and imaged at 15 h postinoculation. adapted viruses were attenuated in cells derived from nonbat hosts. small amounts of NP and the comigrating M1 and NS1 proteins were discernible only in cells infected with WSN and not in cells with WSN carrying the S009 RNP. these viruses induced a pronounced decrease in the synthesis of host proteins compared to that for the uninfected control, indicative of the host shutoff associated with FLUAV infections. the adapted and parental viruses were deep sequenced to identify the genetic basis for the adaptive phenotype. input virus and samples from passages 6 and 9 were analyzed and their sequences were compared to the sequences of the cDNA clones used during the initial rescue of the parental virus. the evolutionary distance between human and bat FLUAVs makes it challenging to predict which differences between these viruses, our adapted viruses, and their parental counterparts might contribute to differences in replication in bat cells. d Viruses were deep sequenced at the indicated passage number (passage 0 [P0], P6, P9). the sequences were compared to the reference genome sequences of the cDNA clones used during the initial rescue of the parental virus. adapted viruses mapped to HA. HA frequently acquires changes to recognize species-specific variations in sialic acid receptors used during viral entry (37\u201339) eudotyped influenza A virus carrying GFP (FVG-G) or VSV carrying GFP enters cells independently of sialic acid receptors. sialic acid receptors are present on bat cell lines and functional for entry of influenza A virus into bat cells. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that alternative receptors must be used to infect the appropriate target cell in vivo. mutant viruses tested the role of PB2 627 mutations during virus replication in Tb 1 Lu cells. avian virus-like polymerase was introduced into WSN by mutating PB2 to E627. mutations at PB2 position 627 control replication ability in bat cells. the specified mutations were inserted into the parental virus. the replication efficiency of all viruses (WSN, WSN mutants, bat-adapted virus) was assessed during multicycle replication experiments in Tb 1 Lu cells. mean viral titers SD (n = 3) were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells. the discovery of two ancient and diverse lineages of FLUAV in bats implies the existence of a large, geographically dispersed cryptic reservoir for FLUAVs. each bat cell line tested, including those derived from Eurasian and African bats, was susceptible to FLUAV infection. adaptive M285K mutation in PA revealed by experimental evolution in bat cells is highly unusual and was detected only once in over 23,000 viruses isolated from humans or animals. the adaptive M285K mutation in PA revealed by experimental evolution in bat cells is highly unusual and was detected only once in over 23,000 viruses isolated from humans or animals. the avian PB2 subunit was also under strong selective pressure in bat cells. the E627K mutation was rapidly fixed in the avian-origin polymerase and conveyed enhanced replication and cytopathic effects. the avian-origin polymerase does not carry either K627 or E627 in the PB2 subunit. HA and NA frequently change before or during cross-species transmission to recognize host-specific variations in the sialic acid receptors used by the virus for attachment to the cell surface. HA and NA preferentially recognizes 2,6-sialosides (79) bats represent a unique environment for FLUAV that rapidly enforces selective pressures on the viral polymerase. replication in nontraditional hosts like bats may be an important source of evolution and diversification of FLUAVs."}
