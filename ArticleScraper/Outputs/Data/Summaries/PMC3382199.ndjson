{"summary": "HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory disease, whereas HBoV2-4 are mainly detected in enteric infections. prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in china. HBoVs are small, non-enveloped viruses with a linear single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 5 kb in length. the VP2 protein harbors the major antigen of HBoV and can form the empty virus-like particles (VLPs) which mimic HBoV virions morphologically and antigenically. the prevalence of HBoV1 is 2\u201319% in patients suffering from acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) worldwide. the detection rate of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 DNA in stool samples has been reported as 1-26%, 0.4-5%, and 0-2%, respectively. the prevalence of HBoV2-4 is higher in children than in adults. samples used in this study were only collected from healthy young people with a narrow range of age. prevalence of a virus infection may vary by age as well as geographically. there remains to be a need to estimate the seroprevalence of HBoVs. the HBoV2 strain 211-BJ07 has 99.9% identity with reference HBoV3 strain PK-2255 [7] as we did not find any HBoV4 positive samples, the VP2 gene of HBoV4 was synthesized according to the sequence of HBoV4 strain NI-385 [9]. the generation of HBoV1-4 VLPs was verified by ultracentrifuge-purification and electron microscopy (EM) Typical parvovirus-like particles of 22\u201324 nm in size were visualized under EM. the purified VLPs of HBoV1, 2, 3 and 4 were also reactive to murine antisera specific for the VP2 protein of the respective HBoV species in Western blot assays. all four antisera reacted strongly with the homologous HBoV VLPs. no significant reactivity was observed with the human parvovirus B19 VP2 or influenza virus H5 hemaglutinin (H5) antiserum. only the negative samples that were negative for HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 VLPs simultaneously were selected as the negative samples. the negativity of those samples was confirmed using a competition ELISA (cELISA) assay. cELISA protocol for detecting IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was optimized using chessboard titration tests. the positive sera and negative sera showed different results at 1200 serum dilutions. the results were similar to those obtained at 1200. HBoV VLPs ELISA tested sera from 15 adults that were positive for human parvovirus B19 VP2 or between HBoVs VP2 and PARV4 VP2. seroprevalence of HBoVs in adults. without competition, more than 90% samples were positive for HBoV1, HBoV2, and HBoV3. children by age 0\u20130.5 (n = 29) 8/2 (27.6/6.9) 3/2 (10.3/6.9) 5/2 (17.2/6.9) 3/1 (10.3/3.4) 0.5\u20132 (n = 62) 4/30 (67.8/48.4) 25/18 (40.3/29) 27/14 (43.5/22.6) 10/0 (16.1/0) 2\u20135 (n = 58) 42/33 (72.4/56.9) 33/23 (56.9/39. the sera were not competed (A), or competed with heterologous VLPs of the other three HBoVs (B) prior to ELISA assays. the net reactivity was calculated as the raw absorbance value subtracted with the corresponding residual absorbance value from homologous competition. year and 5-14 years increased from 10.3% to 31.6%. the seroprevalences of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 IgG decreased about 10-27%. the detection of HBoVs IgG antibodies may be due to maternal antibodies. the seroprevalences of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in acute-phase sera were 29%, 25.8%, 16.1%, and 0%, respectively. ten (32.3%) showed an IgG seroconversion for HBoV1, eight (25.8%) for HBoV2, two (6.5%) for HBoV3, and none for HBoV4. HBoV1 strain 111-BJ07 clustered with reference HBoV1 strain ST2 [1] with homologies of 99.8%. HBoV3 strain 46-BJ07 has 99.6% identity with reference HBoV3 strain W471 [8] Western blot analysis of the HBoV1-4 VLPs detected by mouse antisera against HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 VP2 respectively. the VP2 proteins of HBoV1-4 were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. the generation of HBoV VLPs was verified by ultracentrifuge-purification and electron microscopy (EM) Western blot analysis showed the antisera against HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 reacted strongly with the homologous HBoV VLPs. similar cross-reactivities were also detected by ELISA assays. serum samples identified by cELISA as positive for individual HBoV species were obtained from 3 children and 4 adults. serum samples were monocompeted with concentrations of HBoV1, 2, 3, or 4 VLPs ranging from 0-32 g/mL. sera from three children and four adults were positive. negative sera samples were identified using Western blot analysis. human parvovirus B19 and PARV4 VP2 proteins were used as controls. development of ELISA Methods for detecting anti-HBoV IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 using VLPs as coating antigens. cELISA tested sera from 15 adults that were positive for human parvovirus B19. HBoV VLP ELISA, we did not detect false-positive signals for HBoVs. cELISA resulted in seroprevalences of 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7%, and 1.4%. age (years) HBoV1, HBoV2 HBoV3 HBoV4 All chidren (n = 244) 166a/122b (68c/50d) 119/90 (48.8/36.9) 121/70 (49.6/28.7) 55/2 (22.5/0.8) Children by age 0\u20130.5 (n = 29) 8/2 (27.6/6.9) 3/2 (10.3/6.9) 5/2 (17.2/6.9) the sera were not competed (A), or competed with heterologous VLPs of the other three HBoVs (B) prior to ELISA assays. the net reactivity was calculated as the raw absorbance value subtracted with the residual absorbance value from homologous competition. the rates for HBoV1, 2, and 3 reached to 77.9%, 61.1%, and 58.9%, respectively, in the age group 5-14 years. the seroprevalences of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 IgG decreased about 10-27%. oV4 IgG were also positive for HBoV1, 2, and 3 IgG. the seroprevalences of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in acute-phase sera were 29%, 25.8%, 16.1%, and 0%, respectively. of the 31 samples, ten (32.3%) showed an IgG seroconversion for HBoV1, eight (25.8%) for HBoV2, two (6.5%) for HBoV3, and none cross-reactivity of mouse antisera against HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 VP2 with VP2 VLPs for four species of human bocaviruses. human antibodies against HBoV did not cross react with human parvovirus B19 and PARV4. cELISA results suggest that the seroprevalences of HBoVs are significantly lower than those obtained without competition, especially in adults. findings consistent with those of a recent study of finish and Pakistani individuals, in which the seroprevalences of HBoVs decreased after depletion of heterologous HBoV reactive antibodies. cELISA results show that 17.6% of adults who were positive for IgG against HBoV1, 2, 3, or 4 were negative for IgG against all four HBoVs based on the ELISA results. this finding may be due to antibody waning in the individuals with low IgG levels [22] or to low-affinity antibodies [33]. the seroprevalence of HBoV1-3 increased with age in children. our study provides a basis for future evaluation of epidemiology, genotype distribution, and pathogenesis of HBoVs worldwide. HBoV1 is 1,629 bp (nt 3,373-5,001 according to HBoV1 strain ST1, GenBank accession number DQ000495), HBoV2 is 1,617 bp (nt 3,306-4,922 according to HBoV2 strain PK2255, GenBank accession number FJ170279) in length. phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replicates was generated. the full-length VP2 genes of HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pFastbac1. a tecnai12 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) was used to verify the morphology of the VLPs. combinant VP2 proteins of HBoV1, 2, 3 and 4 were also expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells and purified as previously described. the genes used in prokaryotic cloning were the same as those in a baculovirus expression system. oV VLPs were used as coating antigen (0.125 g/mL) the absorbance of each serum sample was read at 450 nm. the mean values of the duplicate samples were calculated. all experiments were performed in the facilities of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences (ILAS), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. antibodies in serum samples were absorbed with heterologous VLPs of the other three HBoVs, as previously described. HBoV VLPs were serially diluted from 32 g/mL to 0.5 g/mL to determine the concentration needed for effective competition. the DNA of HBoV1, but not HBoV2-4, was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates of 31 patients. all serum samples were stored at 80\u00b0C prior to use. written informed consent was obtained from all participants or guardians on behalf of children. phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replicates was generated based on the complete sequences of the VP2 genes used in this study. HBoV1 strains ST1, ST2, and TW2888_06; HBoV2 strains W153, PK-2255, LZ55602, and 277-BJ07; and HBoV4 strains NI-385 were used as reference sequences. SO4 was added to the supernatants at a final concentration of 20% (w/v) precipitants were harvested by centrifugation and dissolved in CsCl solutions with densities of 1.4 g/mL in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.7, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) after centrifugation at 35,000 rpm and 18\u00b0C for 39 high five cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing PARV4 VP2 gene at a MOI of five. the cells were collected three days post-infection and purified using a hisTrap HP 1 ml column. the concentrations of all purified protein were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. purified mouse IgG antibodies were serially diluted from 8 g/mL to 0.008 g/mL. cross-reactivity between HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 was tested using Western blot analysis and ELISA. the absorbance at 450 nm was residual absorbance value. a P value 0.05 was considered significant."}
