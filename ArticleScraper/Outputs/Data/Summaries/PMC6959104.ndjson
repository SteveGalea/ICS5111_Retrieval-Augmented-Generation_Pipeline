{"summary": "the epithelium of the lungs is the largest surface in the human body that is in contact with our environment. an elaborate machinery is therefore present at this large surface to defend this tissue against invading pathogens. the first line of defense at the entire length of the tract is formed by the innate immune system [1, 2] this review will focus on the evasion of the innate immune system by the array of respiratory viruses. the balance between the efficacy of the combined innate and adaptive responses on the host's side dictates the disease outcome. this review will focus on the evasion of the innate immune system by the array of respiratory viruses. the innate immune response signaling cascade starts with the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for RNA viruses in the lungs, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7 and 8, which are expressed on several of the mentioned cell types, are important PRRs. intracellular cytosolic PRRs such as MDA5 and RIG-I, which are present in virtually any cell type including those of the lung, have been shown to infected cells express a myriad of interferon stimulated genes that establish a so-called antiviral state. this state quite efficiently inhibits further spread of the infection, and simultaneously triggers further adaptive responses that eventually will clear the virus from the infected individual. particular type III IFNs (IL-28/29) play a prominent role in defense of epithelial surfaces such as that in the lung. FN machinery is insufficient due to higher doses of pathogens coming in. type III IFN does not trigger inflammation as much as type I IFN. this probably indicates an important unique aspect of the type III IFN induction, which may have a role in the protection of lung epithelial tissue from immunopathology. immune cells adapt the choice for the use of their metabolic systems to an immune-activated situation that requires increased amounts of energy. this resembles \u201cthe Warburg effect\u201d, as described in tumor cells, and after pathogen sensing innate immune response thus triggers changes in the cell's metabolism. this resembles \u201cthe Warburg effect\u201d, as described in tumor cells, and after pathogen sensing innate immune response triggers changes in the cell's metabolism. the virus that have a +RNA genome replicates exclusively in the cytosol. a report by al-Mulla and co-workers showed that in coV mutants that produced only half the number of ROs during infection or in which the structures were smaller, replication as well as fitness of these viruses. this was true in cultures of primary host cells, which presumably have a fully functional intracellular innate immune system. it is not clear whether (part of) the viral replication takes place outside the replication organelles in these mutant virus infections. it is unclear whether the replication organelles protect from innate immune sensors that recognize viral RNA. MxA is a well-known human type I and III interferon-inducible factor that inhibits influenza virus infections. the exact mechanism of inhibition is still not clear for several of the viruses inhibited by Mx proteins. the idea is that MxA attacks influenza while its products are in the cytosol. cytosolic innate immune RNA sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 replicate in the cytosol of respiratory epithelial cells and shield their replicating RNAs. replication inside the nucleus may have been an alternative solution to avoid innate immune recognition of viral nucleic acid products in the cytosol. respiratory viruses have evolved several ways of modifying these RNAs to avoid recognition by the innate immune RNA sensors. they use a specialized, virally encoded cap-mimicking peptide, called VPg, and attach this to the viral RNA 5\u2032 end to protect it from recognition by the innate immune RNA sensors. these viruses do not need a cap structure for translation of their mRNAs, since they use cap-independent internal ribosomal entry site-mediated two methylations are part of the canonical cap-structures on cellular mRNAs. the latter viruses make sure to add 2'-O methylation to their cap-structures using a dedicated viral enzyme called nsp16. this turned out to be important to avoid recognition by the MDA5 sensor. the PA endonuclease is responsible for cleaving host mRNAs for cap-snatching during transcription of the influenza RNA. many influenza strains express shorter forms of this protein encoded by the same gene, overlapping with PA at the N-terminal region, but with an alternative or truncated C-terminal region. these alternative PA proteins from segment 3 of the influenza genome are called PA-X or PAXdeltaC20, which were discovered recently to have mRNAs may also degrade viral RNA to prevent recognition by innate immune sensors and activation of innate immune responses. the same counts for the rhinoviruses, so this virus may use alternative innate immune evasion strategies. viruses likely evolved escape mechanisms to avoid all these different cellular mechanisms for RNA degradation to be able to set-up a productive infection in this hostile environment. the details of several of these mechanisms for the respiratory viruses discussed here are still unknown. nsp1 binds the 40S subunit of ribosomes to halt translation of cellular mRNAs. nsp1 is the most 5\u2032-terminal subunit of the replicate polyprotein of these viruses. the mechanism of halting translation of cellular mRNAs is achieved. viral mRNAs depend on internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation. the 2A protease of these viruses is responsible for this, by directly cleaving this factor. elF4E, another subunit of the cellular translation initiation complex, is required for cleavage of elF4G during infection. stalled translation and pre-initiation complexes trigger the formation of stress granules. stress granules may form a platform for innate immune responses. in the last decade, it has become clear that many viruses manipulate stress granule formation to benefit their replication. ORF 4 (encoding 4a and 4b proteins) was removed, but still suppressed stress granule formation. this suggests that 4a's activity is not the only way in which the virus inhibits stress granule formation. this is not surprising given the role of NS1 in host-shut-off and in protecting the viral RNA from recognition by RNA sensors. NS1, the influenza nucleoprotein NP and polymerase subunit PA-X help to prevent stress granule formation, due to their RNA protection and host-shut off functions. a recent report showed that binding of eiF4GI translation factor to stress granule-inducing protein G3BP1 is essential for \u00adantiviral stress granule formation. this interaction is disrupted by the 2A or L proteases of picornaviruse rhinovirus 2A protease cleaves nucleus pore proteins Nup62 and Nup98. 3C protease appears to cleave nucleus nucleus 111, 112. it is not clear what 3C protease is doing there exactly. ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein that can be conjugated with its C-terminus to lysine residues in substrate proteins. additional ubiquitins can be added to the first via one of 7 lysines in ubiquitin itself, yielding poly-ubiquitin chains. the signal that the ubiquitin chain gives depends on the linkage type(s) of the chain. PLpro can deubiquitinate the ligase that mediates p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and innate immune signaling. a decade ago, influenza virus NS1 was shown to bind E3 ligase TRIM25, thereby interfering with K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. influenza NS1 was recently shown to destabilize Mdm2 E3 ligase. this is because Mdm2 seems to have a p53-independent antiviral function. this is, however, in contrast to what was mentioned for NL63 CoV. a combination of mutations in NS2 prevents STAT2 from being degraded during infection. it is not clear whether RSV inhibits or evades ISG15 antiviral effects or not. rhinoviruses have been implicated in ubiquitin-regulated processes to date. no other reports hint at manipulation of the ubiquitin system by rhinoviruses. nsp3 and nsp4 of coVs, the N and P proteins of RSV [41] and 2B,2C and 3A proteins of enterovirus (polio; [42]) expression of specific hydrophobic viral proteins can usually mimic the formation of these structures, for example, nsp3 and nsp4 of coVs [40], the N and P proteins of RSV [41], and 2B,2C and 3A proteins. replication organelles protect viral replication from innate immune attack. it is unclear whether replication organelles protect from innate immune sensors. recognizing and attacking them would provide an efficient way for the innate immune system to inhibit viral infection. the idea is that MxA attacks influenza while its products are in the cytosol. in pigs, GBPs inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (an arterivirus, distantly related to the CoVs) in mice, encephalomyocarditis virus and murine norovirus, which are both +RNA viruses, are suppressed by interferon-induced GBPs. RNA sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 subsequently trigger antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses to suppress further replication. replication inside the nucleus may have been an alternative solution to avoid innate immune recognition of viral nucleic acid products in the cytosol. the type I IFN signaling cascade is utterly relevant for defense against +RNA viruses. it includes effectors that influence the integrity of ROs induced by equine arteritis virus, a +RNA arterivirus and a distant relative of the CoVs. it is not yet clear which type I IFN-inducible factors are responsible. BPs inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. encephalomyocarditis virus and murine norovirus are suppressed by -gamma-induced GBPs. this depends on part of the autophagy machinery, namely the LC3 conjugation system. the viral genome, packaged in nucleocapsid proteins, is recognized by RIG-I. the recognition by RIG-I is the major trigger to the production of type I IFN during influenza infection, while also TLR3 plays a role. the cell has evolved multiple ways to attack influenza replication. the rhinoviruses are members of the picornavirus family. they use a virally encoded cap-mimicking peptide, called VPg. they attach this to the viral RNA 5\u2032 end to protect it from recognition by the innate RNA sensors. virus encodes endonuclease activity in one of their non-structural proteins. the latter 2 systems recognize and destroy foreign RNA in the cytosol independently of the RIG-I-like sensors to remove microbial products. the virus apparently destroys its own RNA at certain locations or in certain stages of the infection. the truncated PAXdeltaC20 seems to have very low endonuclease activity [70]. the immune modulation by these alternative PA proteins is thought to be achieved by stimulating host shut-off, another innate immune evasion strategy further discussed below. mutant viruses in which this PA-X protein was expressed in significantly lower amounts elicit higher levels of innate immune response. a recent report indicated that cytosolic coronaviral mRNAs are targeted by the cellular nonsense-mediated decay pathway. this pathway detects aberrant translation termination features such as premature termination codons in mRNA, resulting in the degradation of these mRNAs. the details of several of these mechanisms for the respiratory viruses discussed here are still unknown. the rhinoviruses are members of the picornavirus family. they use a virally encoded cap-mimicking peptide, called VPg. they attach this to the viral RNA 5\u2032 end to protect it from recognition by the innate RNA sensors. virus encodes endonuclease activity in one of its non-structural proteins. the latter 2 systems recognize and destroy foreign RNA in the cytosol independently of the RIG-I-like sensors to remove microbial products. virus apparently destroys its own RNA at certain locations or in certain stages of the infection to avoid the triggering of the RNA sensing. the truncated PAXdeltaC20 seems to have very low endonuclease activity. the immune modulation by these alternative PA proteins is thought to be achieved by stimulating host shut-off. mutant viruses in which this PA-X protein was expressed in significantly lower amounts elicited higher levels of innate immune response. cytosolic coronaviral mRNAs are targeted by the cellular nonsense-mediated decay pathway, a pathway that detects aberrant translation termination features such as premature termination codons in mRNA. viruses likely evolved escape mechanisms to avoid all these different cellular mechanisms for RNA degradation to be able to set-up a productive infection. viral polymerase complex and viral 'immune evasion' NS1 each contribute to host shut-off during influenza infection. interactions of viral polymerase complex with cellular translation machinery cause degradation of Pol II, thereby inhibiting cellular mRNA production and translation. in 1998, Nemerof et al. discovered role of influenza encoded NS1 in host shut-off. MERS-CoV encoded nsp1 distinguishes between cellular mRNAs produced in the nucleus and viral mRNAs in the cytosol. the translation of the latter is not inhibited by MERS-CoV nsp1. this is different from SARS-CoV nsp1 which inhibits all mRNA translations. cellular mRNAs are accumulated upon induction of cellular stress responses that lead to inhibition of cellular translation. stress granules are structures in which, upon stress responses, the cell concentrates mRNAs that are produced but can no longer be translated. the accumulation of untranslated mRNAs and stalled translation and pre-initiation complexes trigger the formation of stress granules. replication of RSV is inhibited, suggesting a beneficial role for stress granules. a subsequent report showed that PKR activation is required for the induction of stress granules by RSV, however, this is dispensable for viral replication. up until today, it remains unclear what the role of stress granules during RSV infection is exactly. this suggests that the activity of 4a and other stress granule-inducing MERS-CoV proteins may differ per cell line. this virus also inhibits the formation of stress granules. this is not surprising given the role of NS1 in host-shut-off and in protecting the viral RNA from recognition by RNA sensors. rhinoviruses use their proteases to cleave their viral polyproteins into functional subunits during the viral life cycle. this may also prevent stress granule formation, but this has not been investigated for rhinoviruses yet. rhinovirus 2A protease activity also plays a role in targeting rhinovirus 3C protein to the nucleus. ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein that can be conjugated with its C-terminus to lysine residues in substrate proteins. ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein that can be conjugated with its C-terminus to lysine residues in substrate proteins. a lot of viruses have evolved ways to manipulate the ubiquitin system and ubiquitin-like molecules such as ISG15. a structural resemblance between SARS-CoV expressed PLpro and the cellular deubiquitinase HAUSP/USP7 soon became clear that coV PLpros had intrinsic deubiquitinating activity. it is still unclear which cellular and viral factors are deconjugated by PLpro during infection. influenza NS1 was shown to bind E3 ligase TRIM25, thereby interfering with K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. this inhibits innate immune signaling in the type-I IFN pathway. NS1 also inhibits ISG15 antiviral activity by binding the N-terminus of human ISG15 (and not mouse ISG15) RSV NS1 targets TRIM25 to suppress ubiquitin-mediated signaling. this probably corroborates the importance of TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination in the innate immune signaling cascade. it has been claimed that NS2 somehow stimulates (K48-linked) ubiquitination of proteins. viral polymerase complex and viral \"immune evasion\" NS1 each contribute importantly to host shut-off during influenza infection. NS1 interacts with an essential component of the 3\u2032 end processing machinery of cellular pre-mRNAs, CPSF30, whereby 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation of cellular mRNAs is inhibited, thereby contributing to host shut-off. nsp1 binds the 40S subunit of ribosomes to halt translation of cellular mRNAs. nsp1 is the most 5\u2032-terminal subunit of the replicate polyprotein of these viruses. nsp1 binds the 40S subunit of ribosomes to halt translation. a report by Bruce et al. suggests that RSV specifically targets mRNA encoding surfactant protein A, an innate immune factor with an important role in the epithelial tissue of the lung. mRNA translation efficiency seems inhibited, but the mechanism for this effect has not been elucidated to date. in the last decade, it has become clear that many viruses manipulate stress granule formation to benefit their replication, for example, RSV. in the later stages of RSV infection in epithelial cells, stress granules are formed, and if expression of G3BP is knocked-down, replication of RSV is inhibited, suggesting a beneficial role for stress granules. 4a's activity is not the only way in which the virus inhibits stress granule formation. this is not surprising given the role of NS1 in host-shut-off. this is not surprising given the role of NS1 in preventing stress granule formation by NS1 by binding both PKR and NS1. a recent report showed that binding of eiF4GI translation factor to stress granule-inducing protein G3BP1 is essential for \u00adantiviral stress granule formation. this interaction is disrupted by the 2A or L proteases of picornaviruses. rhinoviruses use their 2A papain-like protease to effectively disable cap-dependent translation by cleaving eiF4G to induce host-shut off rhinovirus 2A protease activity also plays a role in targeting rhinovirus 3C protein to the nucleus [113, 114], but it is not clear what 3C protease is doing there exactly. the type I IFN antiviral pathway is very relevant for RNA virus infections, and an essential adaptor that enables downstream signaling in this pathway is IPS-1. the signal that the ubiquitin chain gives depends on the linkage type(s) of the chain. ubiquitin chains are generally the cause of degradation or activation of the substrate. ubiquitin is an important regulating factor, and ISG15 is also an important factor in antiviral innate immunity. SARS-CoV PLpro can deubiquitinate E3 ligase RCHY1 to stimulate ubiquitination of p53 by this ligase. this ligase mediates p53 ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and innate immune signaling in the type-I IFN pathway. a decade ago, influenza virus NS1 was shown to bind E3 ligase TRIM25. this is because Mdm2 seems to have a p53-independent antiviral function. this is in contrast to what was mentioned for NL63 CoV. PLpro seems to stabilize Mdm2 to also benefit infection. innate immune evasion is a major function of respiratory and other RNA viruses. innate immune evasion is a major function of respiratory and other RNA viruses. it is unclear how it interacts with the cell's ubiquitin system. several other mechanisms of innate immune evasion have been described for the 4 respiratory viruses discussed here. one example is the virus-encoded macrodomain, which is absent in influenza virus, rhinoviruses, and RSV. viral innate immune evasive functions of respiratory viruses influence disease outcome and ultimate immune responses. many of the viruses discussed here do not elicit a long-lasting immune protection after infection. rhino, corona, and RSV can re-infect individuals sometime after earlier infection, again causing symptoms. antiviral defenses may be compromised by other mechanisms that impair these defenses. suppressed antiviral innate immune response during virus-induced asthma exacerbations is likely also influenced by the innate immune evasive functions of respiratory viruses. understanding (innate) immune evasion by respiratory viruses could shed light on the possibilities for prevention and cure of asthmatic complications associated with respiratory infections. the more knowledge we gain on the link between virus infection and (innate) immune responses in the host, the higher the chance that we may be able to develop successful and cost-effective remedies. the cost-effectiveness balance is also a factor for the CoVs causing severe infections, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV are in the process of analyzing the effect on disease outcome and immune responses in a mouse model. the more knowledge we gained about the innate immune evasive activity of viral deubiquitinases like MERS-CoV PLpro, the higher the chance that we may be able to develop successful and long-lasting vaccines and antivirals. a number of efforts for MERS-CoV vaccines have reached the stage of clinical trials. a more or less obvious way of exploiting a virus' innate immune evasive functions for the development of new vaccines is to remove one or more of these from the virus using reverse genetic technology. this could yield effective modified live virus vaccines that are attenuated by design. deubiquitinases like MERS-CoV PLpro also prompted an innovative antiviral option. author declares no conflicts of interest."}
