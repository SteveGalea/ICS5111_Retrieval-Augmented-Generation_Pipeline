{"summary": "paramedics recorded a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 6 (motor 4, verbal 1 and eye opening 1) with a core temperature of 30\u00b0C. his nose was deformed and there was airway contamination with blood. he was transferred directly to the major trauma centre. tubation was suspected so the endotracheal tube was removed and bag valve mask ventilation with a guedel airway was attempted. a size 6.0 endotracheal tube was inserted through the cricothyroid membrane. ventilation was still impossible due to high airway pressures. multiple contusions were present involving the left temporal and left frontal lobes. cerebral tonsils were effaced with the cerebral tonsils protruding into the foramen magnum. the paCO2 dropped from 6.44 to 5.06 kPa with a corresponding fall in ICP from 26 to 7 mmHg. at this stage, peak airway pressures were recorded at 24 cm H2O and PaCO2 5.13 kPa and ICP of 10 mmHg. time 1300 2000 0400 1200 2000 0400 1200 2000 0400 1200 2000 0400 1200 CPP 61 69 77 70 77 65 95 70 84 96 78 99 89 ICP (mmHg) 22 10 10 11 18 20 2 12 5 8 12 8 10 Peak airway pressure (cm H2O) 36 30 21 20 22 22 21 20 22 19 24 24 27 TV (mL) 660 500 440 450 430 370 425 420 420 invasive ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with lower (4\u20138 mL/kg) rather than a traditional (10\u201315 mL/kg) tidal volumes reduces mortality and increases ventilator free days. the primary focus of the ARDSnet ventilation is to reduce the peak ventilatory pressures and reduce the risk of baro and volu-trauma to the lung while tolerating permissive hypercapnia. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a veno-venous system with a 22F cannula. the system is primed with a volume of 175 mL which causes minimal cardiovascular changes on commencement of therapy. the system is primed with a volume of 175 mL which causes minimal cardiovascular changes on commencement of therapy. we expect to see a greater use of this therapy in the future. we are about to see the start of the REST trial10 which is introducing a similar system into \u2018at least 40 intensive care units\u2019."}
