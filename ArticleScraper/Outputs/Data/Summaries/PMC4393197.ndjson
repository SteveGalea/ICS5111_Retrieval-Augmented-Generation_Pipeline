{"summary": "alveolar epithelium is composed of type I and type II cells. AEII cells are cuboidal and constitute 60% of all alveolar epithelial cells. AEII cells play a key role in maintaining the integral function of the pulmonary alveolus. focusing on alveolar epithelial mechanotransduction, repair and phenotype transition have been conducted using human bronchial epithelial cells (beAS-2B), AEII-like cell lines (i.e., A549), or primary AEII cells from rodents. increasing concerns have arisen about the differences of activation of signal pathways seen between bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, the loss of human AEII cell under sterile conditions, the specimen of distal portions of normal lung tissue (6\u201310 g) was obtained from patients undergoing lung resection. the specimen was chopped into 1 cm3 in size and washed with HEPES-buffered balanced salt solution (BSS) until clear. the lung pieces were minced (0.5 mm3) with eye scissors and then transferred into a sterilized beaker containing 50 mL BSS. resection Normal lung rejected for transplant Perfusion Not applied Pulmonary artery perfusion Not applied Main stem bronchus lavage Digestion buffer Use of trypsin (10,000 U/mL) to mince lung tissue, and elastase (5 U/mL) for digestion Use of 13 U/mL elastase for digestion Filtration 150, 75, and 40 m in tandem 150, 30 m in tandem. cell pellets were resuspended in adhesion medium for macrophages and fibroblasts. the cell suspension was layered on a 1.040\u20131.089 g/mL discontinuous Percoll gradients. each solution at 3 mL of volume was gently loaded into FBS. enriched cells pellets were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at room air. resuspended in 2 mL SAGM containing 1% FBS. cells were subcultured in either SAGM or DMEM for up to 21 days. transmission electron microscopy is the gold standard to identify AEII cells. AEII cells were gently scraped and then fixed dehydrated. thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

AEII cells were cultured for 21 days (A, DIC) and were probed with a rabbit anti-human pro-SPC (SPC) polyclonal antibody (B, red) and a mouse anti-human cytokeratin-8 (CK-8) monoclonal antibody (C, green) followed by incubation with Cy3 Goat anti-Rabbit and FITC Goat anti-Mouse IgG. expression of ENaC (red) was detected at days 12, 20, and 28 after isolation. expression of the tight junction protein E-cadherin, surfactant protein B (SPB) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin at day 21. primary human small airway epithelial cells served as a negative control for vimentin. the gene expression of CK-8, KL-6, and AQP-3 as AEII markers was observed at 12 (passage 1), maintained at day 21 and decreased at day 28 (Fig.3C). the AEII gene profile was further confirmed using the real-time qPCT methods (Fig.3D). the viability was 95 2% averaged from 28 lungs over 60 h. the morphology of AEII cells appeared to be optimal under the condition of SAGM containing 1% FBS but not under that of DMEM containing 1% or 10% FBS. the cells formed tight junction after reaching confluence asreflected by a constant reading of ECIS. AEII cells were positively identified by DND-26 staining in the cytoplasm. lamellar bodies were not found in human bronchial lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells (Fig.2G and H) and the human lung fibroblasts examined. AEII cells were cultured and expression of ENaC (red) was detected at days 12, 20, and 28 after isolation. expression of the tight junction protein E-cadherin, surfactant protein B (SPB) and mesenchymal marker vimentin was detected. AEII cells or Hela cells were seeded for 12 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by blockade using 2% BSA. cells were immunostained by using rabbit anti-human pro-SPC polyclonal antibody and goat anti-human AQP-5 polyclonal antibody. IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 in culture supernatants. total RNA was extracted from cell lysates and probed for mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-8. studies have shown that the isolated human AEII cells exert function in vitro. however, several major concerns have arose including rapid loss of cell function, especially loss of surfactant protein expression. ephrine, hydrocortisone, and retinoic acid appear to be important for inhibition of differentiation. the epidermal growth factor in SAGM can promote cell proliferation in mammalian cells. phenotype of AEII cells appeared to last longer (i.e., over 20 days) AEII cells showed excellent biological function by upregulation of cytokines, chemokine, and adhesion molecule at gene and protein levels in response to stimulation with TNF-. this provides an important tool to study inflammatory responses involved in AEII cells."}
