{"summary": "merS-CoV is a novel pathogen known to infect dromedary camels and humans. this virus has been circulating in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa for decades. this suggests the presence of unidentified routes of human-to-human transmission or the involvement of other animal species in spreading the virus. donor rabbits were housed with MERS-CoV-inoculated donor rabbits either in the same or in adjacent cages to determine if MERS-CoV can be transmitted via contact or airborne routes. donor rabbits shed high levels of viral RNA but a limited amount of infectious virus. ten new Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups and inoculated with 1 mL of 1 106 TCID50/mL of each MERS-CoV strain intranasally. the intranasal inoculums were divided equally over both nostrils. these animals were sacrificed on day 4 and respiratory tract tissues were collected. the netherland dwarf rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were inoculated intranasally with 1 mL of 1 106 TCID50/mL MERS-CoV Qatar15 strain (500 L per nostril) these animals were then sacrificed on day 4 and their respiratory tract tissues were collected. titration was performed in serial 10-fold dilutions on vero cells. the amount of infectious virus in swab samples was calculated by determining the TCID50. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism program. a 69-year-old man was isolated from a 69-year-old man. he developed severe pneumonia and was PCR confirmed to have a MERS-CoV infection. ten new Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups. a modified version of the previously described influenza A virus ferret transmission set-up was used to study MERS-CoV transmission. the set-up consists of two clear polymethyl methacrylate cages of different sizes. the cages are separated by two stainless steel grids 10 cm apart to prevent direct contact. twelve netherland dwarf rabbits were randomly distributed into four individually housed groups. one nave rabbit from each group was inoculated intranasally with 1 mL of 1 106 TCID50/mL MERS-CoV (500 L per nostril) the other two rabbits were used as direct contact and airborne recipients. the presence of MERS-CoV nucleoprotein and MERS-CoV RNA was detected by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization. the localization of DPP4 in the respiratory tract of non-infected rabbits was analyzed. rabbits express DPP4 in both upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium. this is in line with MERS-CoV tropism in this species. rabbits express DPP4 in both the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium. all three groups of MERS-CoV inoculated rabbits developed minimal clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions. the amount of viral RNA shed in the nasal and throat swabs did not vary among the inoculated groups. however, in the lungs of the rabbits, the amount of viral RNA was significantly lower in group a than in groups b and c. RNA shed by the MERS-CoV-inoculated rabbits in the nasal swabs (A) and throat swabs (B) are reported in genome equivalents per ml (GE/mL) all error bars represent standard deviations. rabbits inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC strain and those with the Qatar15 strain developed an equally mild infection and shed similar levels of viral RNA in their nasal and throat swabs. five new Zealand rabbits were intranasally inoculated either with 1 mL of 1106 TCID50/mL MERS-CoV EMC strain or Qatar15 strain. identical to the new Zealand rabbits [15], the MERS-CoV-inoculated Netherland dwarf rabbits did not develop clinical signs, including nasal discharge. the amount of viral RNA in the nasal and throat swabs (A) as well as in the respiratory tract tissues (B) are displayed in genome equivalents per mL (GE/mL) and genome equivalents per gram tissues (GE/g) the amount of viral RNA shed by the inoculated rabbits remained high until day 7 post inoculation. only two direct contact recipients and two airborne recipient rabbits had detectable viral RNA up to day 5 post inoculation. in the throat swabs, viral RNA was only detected in one direct contact recipient and one airborne recipient rabbit at day 1 post inoculation. RNA and infectious virus were measured in the nasal (A,B) and throat swabs (C,D) the amount of viral RNA is displayed in genome equivalents per mL (GE/mL) infectious virus is shown as 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml (TCID50/mL) dipeptidyl peptidase-1 expression in the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium is detected using immunohistochemistry. type II cells are indicated with arrows, and type I cells with an arrowhead. the isotype control showed no background signal in our assay. all three groups of MERS-CoV inoculated rabbits developed minimal clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions. the amount of viral RNA shed in the nasal and throat swabs did not vary among the inoculated groups. in the lungs of the rabbits, the amount of viral RNA was significantly lower. RNA shed by the MERS-CoV-inoculated rabbits in the nasal swabs (A) and throat swabs (B) are reported in genome equivalents per ml (GE/mL) all error bars represent standard deviations. rabbits inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC strain and those with the Qatar15 strain developed an equally mild infection. rabbits inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC strain and those with the Qatar15 strain developed an equally mild infection. identical to the new Zealand rabbits [15], the MERS-CoV-inoculated Netherland dwarf rabbits did not develop clinical signs, including nasal discharge. the amount of viral RNA in the nasal and throat swabs (A) as well as in the respiratory tract tissues (B) are displayed in genome equivalent per mL (GE/mL) and genome equivalent per gram tissues (GE/g) the amount of viral RNA shed by the inoculated rabbits remained high until day 7 post inoculation. only two direct contact recipients and two airborne recipient rabbits had detectable viral RNA up to day 5 post inoculation. in the throat swabs, viral RNA was only detected in one direct contact recipient and one airborne recipient rabbit at day 1 post inoculation. ERS-CoV RNA and infectious virus were measured in the nasal (A,B) and throat swabs (C,D) the amount of viral RNA is displayed in genome equivalents per mL (GE/mL) infectious virus is shown as 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml (TCID50/mL) rabbits developed both upper and lower respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation [15], either via intranasal or combined intranasal and intratracheal routes. rabbits developed both upper and lower respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation [15], either via intranasal or combined intranasal and intratracheal routes. dromedary camels develop nasal discharge and shed a high amount of infectious virus (104\u2013105 TCID50/mL), almost equal to the amount of viral RNA being shed (105\u2013106 GE/mL), during the first 4 days post inoculation. these differences may indicate presence of nasal discharge and infectious virus shedding as critical factors in transmission of MERS-CoV between humans. MERS-CoV inoculation leads to secretion of large amount of type I and III interferons and production of viral RNA. but most infectious virus shed by these rabbits is defective. further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms that restrict MERS-CoV replication in some MERS-CoV susceptible species, including rabbits."}
