{"summary": "anti-PRRSV GP5-specific antibodies in pigs vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or commercial vaccine JXA1-R could be detected by ELISA at 14 and 28 dpi. at each sampling point, there was no significant difference in the level of GP5 antibody between the group immun serum samples were collected at 14, 28, 35, 42 and 49 dpi to determine the GP5-specific ELISA antibody (A) and neutralizing antibody against JSKM strain (B) PBMCs were separated at 28 and 42 dpi and restimulated in vitro with purified PRRSV proteins (20 g/mL). at 28 and 42 dpi, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte proliferative responses. at 28 and 42 dpi, the stimulation index (SI) detected in the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs, or JXA1-R were numerically higher than the group vaccinated with PBS. itative real-time RT-PCR was performed to analyze the level of Th1 cytokine IFN- mRNA expression in the restimulated splenocytes. there were no significant difference in the level of IFN- mRNA expression among the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 groups increased at 35 dpi. but at 42 dpi, it decreased to a similar level to that detected at 14 dpi. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 had high rectal temperature during 37\u201340 dpi. the mean temperature at each point was lower than the group immunized with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5. pigs in the group had high rectal temperature (40 \u00b0C) only at 37 and 38 dpi. pigs inoculated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 showed a lower level of viremia in blood than that of the control PBS group. however, a similar level of viremia in blood was observed between the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5. viremia of pigs inoculated with different vaccine formulations followed by challenge with the PRRSV JSKM strain. viral loads in heart, liver, lung, kidney, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node from pigs were significantly lower than those from PBS group. interstitial pneumonitis could be observed in pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 groups. this interstitial pneumonitis was largely absent in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R-vaccinated animals. piglets were more severe including interstitial pneumonia with consolidation and hemorrhage. interstitial pneumonia of pigs in both pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R groups was much milder than that in the PBS and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 groups. the immunogenicity of the two formulations of DNA vaccine was investigated in pigs. pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or commercial vaccine JXA1-R were detected on the 14th day after primary immunization and elevated by the 28th day. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and re-stimulated in vitro with purified PRRSV (20 g/mL) at 28 and 42 dpi, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte proliferative responses among the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs. at 28 and 42 dpi, the production of IFN- in the control group was the lowest. the differences were significant (P 0.01 or P 0.001) and significant differences in the level of IFN- mRNA expression in the restimulated splenocytes. at 28 dpi, there were significant differences in the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells between the groups immunized with PBS and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5. after challenge, the number of CD3+ CD4+ T cells decreased at 35 dpi before increasing slightly at 42 dpi in the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA at 35, 38 and 39 dpi, the temperature of the control group was as high as 41 \u00b0C. pigs in the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 group had high rectal temperature. the mean temperature at each point was lower than the group immunized with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5. pigs inoculated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 showed a lower level of viremia in blood than that of the control PBS group. however, a similar level of viremia in blood was observed between the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 pigs vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 showed higher viral loads in the heart, spleen, lung, and mandibular lymph node. but in the liver, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node, pigs showed similar or lower levels in viral loads compared with the group inoculated with JXA1-R. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 were characterized by thickened alveolar walls. interstitial pneumonitis was largely absent in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R-vaccinated animals. interstitial pneumonia of pigs in both pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 groups was much milder than that in both pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 groups. pigs displayed a range of clinical signs, including inappetence, lethargy, rough hair coats, dys pigs in the JXA1-R group had high rectal temperature (40 \u00b0C) no obvious clinical signs were observed. scores for clinical signs were significantly lower than those in the PBS and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 groups. pigs inoculated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 showed higher viral loads in the heart, spleen, lung, and mandibular lymph node. however, in the liver, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node, pigs vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 showed the viral loads in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node from pigs of the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group were significantly lower than those from PBS group. there was no significant difference in viral loads of the sampling tissues between the groups immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R. Macroscopic lesions in piglets were more severe including interstitial pneumonia with consolidation and hemorrhage. interstitial pneumonia with consolidation was observed in the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 group. vaccines against HP-PRRSV have been developed and marketed to the swine industry of china. however, both of them have inherent drawbacks. DNA vaccines are the third revolution in the vaccine field. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 constructs could improve the immunogenicity of pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 in a mouse model. this is the first report of a comparative efficacy test of two formulations of adjuvants used to modify a PRRSV DNA vaccine in pigs. all the test pigs were challenged at 28 dpi with the HP-PRRSV JSKM strain. results showed that all pigs showed more severe clinical signs than the vaccinated groups. no obvious clinical signs or pathological changes could be observed in the groups inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or JXA1-R. studies on adjuvanted PLGA nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine have demonstrated that it could provide cross-protective immunity against PRRSV in pigs38,39,40,41. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 formulations induced enhanced immune responses compared with the parent construct pcDNA3.1-SynORF5. pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 elicited the strongest responses and thus may provide the most efficient protection against PRRSV infection. IFN-1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 may represent promising candidate vaccines against PRRSV. piglets weaned at 3 weeks of age from a PRRS-free farm in Nanjing. pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 dissolved in 1 mL of PBS, each containg 500 g plasmids. control group was injected intramuscularly with commercial PRRSV attenuated vaccine. the neutralization titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in complete neutralization. each sample was run in triplicate. the cDNA product (0.5 L) was reverse transcribed in a 20 L reaction mixture, with 4 L 5 QRT Super Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) the cDNA product (0.5 L) was amplified in a 25 L reaction mixture. each reaction was performed in triplicate. pellet was resuspended in 300 L of cell fluorescence solution for staining with FITC mouse anti-porcine CD3, PE mouse anti-porcine CD8 and SPRD mouse anti-porcine CD4. after washing twice with fluorescence solution, the supernatant was discarded.
