{"summary": "synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays\u2019 target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of Zika virus strains. the 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. the virus usually causes a mild infection in adults. symptoms include fever, arthralgia and rash. severe complications can occur, such as uveitis, meningoencephalitis and uveitis. cleotide mismatches exist between the oligonucleotide sequences of the published assays and the Asian lineage consensus sequence. no single known Zika virus strain accumulating all of these mismatches. the increasing number of divergent Zika virus strains highlights the genetic variability as a potential limiting factor of the sensitivity of Zika virus real-time RT\u2013PCR-based diagnostics. two new assays were designed to have less nucleotide mismatches with the current outbreak strains. the new assays were designed to avoid mismatches in the most critical 3\u2032-terminal regions of oligonucleotides that affect primer binding. chain reaction assays and potential nucleotide mismatches with Zika virus strains. target genomic domain (bases)a No. potential nucleotide mismatchesa Forward primer sequence (5\u2018 to 3\u2018) Reverse primer sequence (5\u2018 to 3\u2018) Control (covered genomic region, bases)a All Zika virus Asian lineage Lanciotti M13 M/E (939\u20131015) 19 7 TTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC CGGCATACAGCATCA IVT II (3145\u20133739) PAHO NS2b12 NS2b/NS3 (4538\u20134628) 11 4 CTGTGGCATGAACCCAATAG CCACGCTCCAGCTGCAAAGG ATCCCATAGAGCACCACTCC uncRNA. all probes are labelled according to GenBank\u00ae accession number: KU321639. control All controls are based on a current Zika virus outbreak strain. as positive controls, we generated five assay-specific quantified in vitro transcripts (IVT) for the respective genomic target regions. data on analytical sensitivity, including the measure lower limit of detection, are not available for most of the published assays. uncRNA 1.0 available at: http://www.european-virus-archive.com/Portal/produit.php\"ref=1603&id_rubrique=9; and uncRNA 1.0 available at: http://www.european-virus-archive.com/portal/produit.php\"ref=1603&id_rubrique=9. potential cases of laboratory contamination with the uncRNA can be proven by two real-time RT\u2013PCR marker assays. these assays contain detection probes that target the overlap of two joined genomic target domains. dengue virus RNA quantification and flavivirus typing were done as described previously. we used the superscript III one-Step RT\u2013PCR kit (Thermo Fischer) or the Qiagen\u00ae one-Step RT\u2013PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 and LightCycler 2.0, a Qiagen Rotor Gene HQ and an Applied Biosystems 7500 thermocycler. Probit regression analyses were done using SPSS V22 (IBM, Ehningen, Germany) and two new assays were designed to avoid mismatches in the most critical 3\u2032-terminal regions of oligonucleotides that affect primer binding the most. the new NS1 assay was additionally designed to allow cross-detection of the Spondweni virus because regions conserved between related virus taxa are expected to have less variation than other genomic regions.

Using an insensitive assay with a lower limit of detection of 1 104 copies/reaction, the proportion of estimated false-negative test results is about 50%. the estimated risk of false-negative results was several-fold lower for dengue than for the Zika virus (t-test, P = 0.03) the estimated risk of false-negative results was several-fold lower for dengue than for the Zika virus. our new assays may be more robust against genetic variation. but real-time monitoring of all assays\u2019 oligonucleotide binding regions is required during the current situation. we suggest that laboratories can use these five assays for diagnostics during the current outbreak. reagents can be shipped internationally without biosafety concerns. low viral loads in patients imply high risk of false-negative test results. low viral loads in patients imply a high risk of false-negative test results. a significant proportion of patients with low viral loads may have gone undiagnosed by molecular testing during the current outbreak. Endemic countries also need highly sensitive molecular Zika virus detection methods to ensure safe blood transfusions. quantitative positive control can ensure high sensitivity and good comparability of qualitative and quantitative results in diagnostic laboratories and clinical studies."}
