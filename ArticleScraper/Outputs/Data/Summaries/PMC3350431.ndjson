{"summary": "u.s. policymakers have raised several concerns about the practical use of these models. we surveyed PubMed and other sources for published research literature on simulation models for pandemic preparedness. the national network of public health institutes, at the request of CDC, conducted a national survey of the practitioners. the challenges identified by the survey are summarized in Table 1. public health practitioners challenge description of the challenge A1. Validity of data support Model parameters need to be derived from updated demographical and epidemiological data A2. Credibility and validity of assumptions Models need to use credible and valid assumptions A3. Represent human behavior Models need to incorporate human behavior A4. Accessibility Models need to be easily accessible and run on personal computers A5. Lack of resources Need to fund staff allocation and training for model implementation A9. Lack of mandates for models State and federal agencies need to develop mandates for use of model- iom recommends enhancing data collection protocols to support real-time decision making. archival of data must allow expedited access for model driven decisions. iom recommends enhancing data collection protocols. the major model parameters include: the reproduction number, defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case [12]. the proportion of the population who become infected, also called infection attack rate [13]. the disease natural history within an individual; and fractions of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. if the model software is available to general public (open source or closed source code), - presence of end user support (user manuals, e-mail/phone technical support), - information on the number of replicates needed for valid output, - information on the running time, - information on the ways to manage the computational load for implementing large-scale scenarios (e.g., the use of distributed and parallel computing). ability to represent human behavior (A3) It has been observed in [1] that the existing PI models fall short of capturing relevant aspects of human behavior. this observation naturally evokes the following questions: what are the relevant behavioral aspects that must be considered in PI models. the choice of the PI model itself can also have a significant influence on the computational burden. differential equation models divide population members into compartments. in each compartment every member makes the same number of contacts. we limited the paper to contain the scope of this review. we defined single-region for the purpose of this review as either a country or any part thereof. there exists a significant and important body of literature dedicated to global pandemic influenza modeling. review the criteria for the design and implementation challenge (A1), we selected the article with the largest and most detailed testbed (marked in bold in Table 3). the challenges A3-A5 were examined separately for each of the selected articles. in our review, we examined epidemiological, demographical, and social-behavioral parameters of the pandemic models. the risk groups for vaccine and antiviral (which are mitigation parameters) are functions of epidemiological parameters such as susceptibility to infection and susceptibility to death, respectively. the timeliness of a decision is as important as its correctness [11], and there should be a balance between the cost of data updating and the marginal benefits of the model driven decisions. a review of the existing PI models at provincial and local levels examined the validity of data used in supporting major model parameters. model assumptions are often made to balance data needs, analytical tractability, and computational feasibility of the models with their ability to support timely and correct decisions. if a model objective is to test a household isolation strategy, the model assumptions must allow tracking of all the individuals within the household. ability to represent human behavior (A3) It has been observed in [1] that the existing PI models fall short of capturing relevant aspects of human behavior. ability to access the models is essential for end users, but executing the PI models on personal computers may not be feasible due to the computational complexities of the models. higher population size of the affected region requires larger datasets to be accessed, retrieved, and downloaded to populate the models. other critical issues that add to the computational burden are: data interface with a limited bandwidth, the frequency of updating of data during a pandemic progress, pre-processing requirement for raw data. the data must be temporally consistent, i.e., it must represent the actual state of the outbreak. in the united states and other few countries, availability of temporally consistent demographical data is currently supported by governmental databases including the decennial census and the national household travel survey [7-10]. study of the design and implementation challenges of the existing PI models Design and implementation challenges Plan of examination Validity of data support (A1) for model parameters For each PI model and for each of the major model parameters (e.g., reproduction number, illness attack rate) A1a. Age of data A1c. Type of interface for data access and retrieval (manual, automatic) A1d. Technique to translate raw data into model parameter values (e.g., reproduction number, simulated, assumed) A1b if a model objective is to test a household isolation strategy, the model assumptions must allow tracking of all the individuals within the household so that the contact among the household members can be assigned. if a model objective is to test a household isolation strategy, the model assumptions must allow tracking of all the individuals within the household. accessibility and scalability (A4, A5) Public health practitioners have indicated the need for openly available models and population specific data that can be downloaded and synthesized using personal computers. executing the PI models on personal computers may not be feasible due to the computational complexities of the models. 640 papers were found which were published between 1990 and 2010. a total of 640 papers were found between 1990 and 2010. we included this criterion in order to evaluate models with respect to the challenge of \"validity of data support\" an additional snowball search was implemented outside PubMed, which yielded 5 additional eligible papers. the total number of papers reviewed to twenty-three. eight of the ten model clusters presented in Table 3 are agent-based simulation models. eight are agent-based simulation models, while the rest are differential equation models. most models use purely epidemiological measures to assess effectiveness of mitigation strategies. the most commonly used epidemiological parameters are reproduction number (R), illness attack rate (IAR), disease natural history parameters, and fraction of asymptomatic infected cases. the most commonly used epidemiological parameters are reproduction number (R), illness attack rate (IAR), disease natural history parameters, and fraction of asymptomatic cases. real-time monitoring of parameters describing disease natural history and fraction of asymptomatic cases is generally not necessary since they are mostly dependent on the intrinsic genomic features of the virus. estimates may include surveys (e.g., household surveys of members of index cases) and laboratory experiments that inoculate pandemic strains into human volunteers. the wallinga estimator was extended by Cowling [61] to allow for reporting delays and repeated importations. the Fraser estimator was extended by Nishiura [63] to allow the estimation of the reproduction number for a specific age class given infection by another age class. surveillance systems are passive as they mostly collect data from infected cases who are seeking healthcare. the above enhancement can be achieved by developing methods for statistical sampling and testing of specimens in the PHL. alterations in the specimen submission policies during a pandemic may not be necessary. alterations in the specimen submission policies during a pandemic may not be necessary. data sources supporting parameters for importation reach beyond the modeled region requiring regional models to couple with global importation models. this coupling is essential since the possibility of new infection arrivals may accelerate the occurrence of the pandemic peak. we examine the assumptions regarding contact probability and the frequency of new infection updates (e.g., daily, quarterly, hourly) in two models: the Imperial-Pitt [14] and the UW-LANL models [15]. we first examine the assumptions that influence contact probabilities within different mixing groups. the assumption of contact probability varying with age matches reality better than assuming it to be constant. Imperial-Pitt and the UW-LANL models do not evaluate infection status after each contact event. the models evaluate infection status every six hours [14] or at the end of the day [15] by aggregating the contact events. in real-life situations, it will be nearly impossible to determine the exact time of each infection. it is unlikely that any mitigation strategy would have an element that depends of the minute by minute changes in the disease status. it may be unnecessary to consider a time scale of the order of a minute for a model and thus increase both computational and data needs. existing surveys collected during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak can be useful in quantifying the above parameters. there are surveys that quantify the levels of support for school closure, follow up on sick students by the teachers [78], healthcare seeking behavior [80], perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, fear, general compliance intentions, role of information, role of information, wishful thinking, fatalistic thinking, avoiding social contact, avoiding health care professionals, keeping children at home and staying at home. available new methodologies to model social-behavior should be incorporated into the operational models. accessibility and scalability of the selected models. three of the models that make their source codes accessible to general public are influsim [43], Ciofi [30] and FluTE [23] model output measures and run time per replicate are major scalability issues for pandemic simulation models. large-scale simulations of the U.S. population reported running times of up to 6 h per replicate. it would then take a run time of one week to execute 28 replicates of only one pandemic scenario. limitations of the review There exist several simulation models of pandemic influenza that can be used at the provincial and local levels. their exclusion is due to their limited available documentation discussing the choice of demographic, social-behavioral or epidemiological parameters. IARs have been estimated primarily using household sampling studies [33], epidemic surveys [29,45], and case time series reported for 2009 H1N1 [36,46]. the parameters of the disease natural history have been estimated from household random sampling data [27,33,47], viral shedding profiles from experimental control studies [23,43,48,49], and case time series reported for 2009 H1N1 [36,46]. allinga et al. [55,56], Fraser [57], White and Pagano [58], Bettencourt et al. [59], and Cauchemez et al. [60] propose an instantaneous R that observes how past case incidence data contribute to the present incidence at time t. further extensions of the above methods have been developed to accommodate more realistic assumptions. only a fraction of symptomatic cases are detected with a probable time delay from the onset of symptoms. new scheduling protocols will have to be developed to better assess epidemiological parameters of an outbreak. a better real-time assessment of the IAR may not be necessary. tools for translation of data into model parameter values range from simple arithmetic conversions to more time-consuming methods of fitting mathematical and statistical models. if real-time incidence estimates are to be translated into PI models parameters, complex translation techniques might delay execution of the model. data sources supporting parameters for importation of infected cases reach beyond the modeled region. this information on peak occurrence could significantly influence time of interventions. single region models also consider a pseudo global coupling through constant introduction of cases per unit time. recent phylogenetic studies on the 2009 H1N1 virus help to identify which of the above epidemiological parameters need real-time re-assessment. real-time monitoring of parameters describing disease natural history and fraction of asymptomatic cases is generally not necessary since they are mostly dependent on the intrinsic genomic features of the virus. Fraser proposes an instantaneous R that observes how past case incidence data contribute to the present incidence at time t. in contrast, Wallinga et al. and Cauchemez et al. propose an instantaneous R that can be called a running estimate of the instantaneous reproduction number. further extensions of these methods have been developed to accommodate more realistic assumptions. the existing first-come-first-serve testing policy and manual methods for receiving and processing the specimens further delayed the pace of publication of confirmed cases. the current status of the surveillance systems calls for the models to account for: underreporting rates, the delay between onset of symptoms and infection reporting, and the fear factor. if real-time incidence estimates are to be translated into PI models parameters, complex translation techniques might delay execution of the model. the most common demographic parameters are population size/density, distribution of household size, peer-group size, age, commuting travel, long-distance travel, and importation of infected cases. single region models consider a closed community with infusion of a small set of infected cases at the beginning [24,26,34]. single region models also consider a pseudo global coupling through a constant introduction of cases per unit time [15,29]. the assumptions can be considered credible and valid. for workplaces and schools, the assumption of 75% of contacts within the group and 25% contacts outside the group appears closer to reality than the assumption of constant probability in the UW-LANL model [72] the models evaluate infection status every six hours [14] or at the end of the day [15] by aggregating the contact events. the models evaluate infection status every six hours [14] or at the end of the day [15] by aggregating the contact events. in real-life situations, it will be nearly impossible to determine the exact time of each infection. s of data confidentiality, cost of the sensing devices, and low compliance to the activation of sensing applications might prevent the Bluetooth and RFID technologies from being effectively used in evolving pandemic outbreaks. other social-behavioral parameters that are considered by the reviewed models are reactive withdrawal from work or school due to appearance of symptoms [27,36,38,43], work absenteeism to care for sick relatives or children at home. there is a need for further studies to establish the relative influence of social-behavioral factors on operational models for pandemic spread and mitigation. the influential factors need to be analyzed to determine how relevant information about those factors should be collected (e.g., in real-time or through surveys before an outbreak), accessed, retrieved, and translated into the final model parameter values. influsim has a GUI, whereas Ciofi and UW-LANL are provided as a C/C++ code. other C++ models are planning to become, or are already, publicly accessible, according to the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [86] survey. the issue of the computational burden is daunting nonetheless. we believe that the modeling community should actively seek to develop innovative methodologies to reduce the computational requirements associated with obtaining reliable outputs. the review includes several simulation models of pandemic influenza. the literature on pandemic models is rich and contains analysis and results that are valuable for public health preparedness. we analyzed the most common epidemiological and demographical parameters that are used in pandemic models. we discussed the need for adequate updating of these parameters during an outbreak. some mitigation strategies require more realistic model assumptions. others require models that track geographic coordinates so that those within a radius of an infected individual can be identified. some of the examined models attempt to capture social-behavioral issues. models should be housed in a cyber computing environment with an easy user interface for the decision makers.
