{"summary": "the high case-fatality rate is complicated by the rapid emergence of antiviral resistance (5). the high case-fatality rate is complicated by the rapid emergence of antiviral resistance. there is interest in novel therapeutic approaches for the effective treatment of severe influenza virus infections. treatment with J-LEAPS conjugates triggers Th1 responses. other studies with J-LEAPS conjugates support their therapeutic use for autoimmune conditions. peptides conjugated to HA1- and HA2-conjugated LEAPS peptides resulted in better DC maturation than HA1- and HA2-conjugated LEAPS peptides. we infected mice with a lethal dose of the mouse-adapted influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8). titers were measured in the lungs harvested 4 days after infection. 50% of the mice that received combined-LEAPS treatment survived. Combined influenza-J-LEAPS\u2013loaded DCs reduce morbidity and mortality. culated i.n. with 10 LD50 (103 TCID50) of PR8 virus or diluent (Leibovitz-15, L-15) 24 hours before administering 107 cells of CFSE-labeled nonpulsed or combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs i.v. CFSE-labeled combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs, but not nonpulsed DCs or JH-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs, endogenous DCs expressed high levels of CD86 and MHC-II. those of naive and infected mice did not. 107 CFSE-labeled combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs were injected i.v. into naive mice. NP-LEAPS\u2013, M2e-LEAPS\u2013, and combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs showed a similar effect on survival (Figure 3A), weight loss (Figure 3B), and virus titers in the lungs of infected animals 4 days after infection. NP and/or M2e is critical for the efficacy of LEAPS treatment. influenza-J-LEAPS treatment is effective when administered at 24 or 48 hours after infection. we infected mice with a low dose (103 TCID50, 10 LD50) of PR8, which results in 100% mortality between days 6\u20138 after infection and administered 107 NP-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs i.v. at 24, 48, or 72 hours after infection. Influenza-J-LEAPS enhance Th1 responses in influenza infection. we compared the cytokine profile in the lungs of infected animals after i.v. administration of NP-LEAPS, M2e-LEAPS, HA1-LEAPS, HA2-LEAPS, and combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs. leAPS treatment results in decreased proinflammatory cytokines and increased Th1 cytokines in the lungs of PR8-infected mice (A) on day 4 after infection, lung homogenates were analyzed for cytokine protein expression. each data point represents the result from an individual mouse. infected mice were infected with 10 LD50 of PR8. NP-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs elicit a rapid influenza-specific CD8+ T cell response. NP-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs elicit a rapid influenza-specific CD8+ T cell response. mock-infected mice received JH-LEAPS DCs or NP-LEAPS DCs 24 hours after infection. the lungs were harvested on day 4 after infection and mock-infected mice were used as control. depletion of CD8+ T cells reduces efficacy of influenza-J-LEAPS treatment. inflammatory response was associated with reduced lung virus titers. inflammatory response was associated with virus clearance. NP-LEAPS DC treatment is effective in treating oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus\u2013infected mice. mice were orally gavaged with 20 mg/kg/d of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir) for 5 days starting 4 hours before infection. a group of animals received NP-LEAPS DCs i.v. 24 hours after infection. oseltamivir failed to reduce replication of the virus in the lungs of infected animals. infected, untreated control, and oseltamivir-treated mice lost weight rapidly. the mice that received combined treatment (NP-LEAPS DCs and oseltamivir) continued to lose weight. influenza-J-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs rescue mice from lethal influenza infection. we infected mice with lethal dose of the mouse-adapted influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34. we infected mice with 105 TCID50 (1000 LD50) of virus. we administered combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs 24 hours after infection. lower virus titers were seen in the lungs of combined-LEAPS mice. influenza-J-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs home to the lungs of uninfected mice. mice were inoculated with 10 LD50 (103 TCID50) of PR8 virus or diluent. the numbers of CFSE-positive cells were determined in the lungs 8, 24, and 48 hours later. d DCs in the whole blood of naive mice were higher than in PR8-infected mice that received combined LEAPS-pulsed DCs. these findings suggest that LEAPS stimulation enhances the homing of influenza-peptide\u2013bearing DCs to the lungs, which is the site of infection. we infected 6 groups of mice with a low dose of PR8 and administered 107 DCs pulsed with NP-LEAPS, M2e-LEAPS, HA2-LEAPS, combined-LEAPS or JH-LEAPS i.v. 24 hours later. either NP and/or M2e is critical for the efficacy of the combined-LEAPS DC treatment. BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 10 LD50 of PR8. mice received NP, HA1, HA2, or M2e-conjugated LEAPS pulsed DCs. titers were determined from lungs of mice harvested 4 days after infection. i.v. injection of NP-LEAPS, or JH-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs injected at 24, 48, or 72 hours after infection. percentage survival (A), percentage change in body weight (B) and virus titer in the lungs 4 days after infection are presented. compared the cytokine profile in the lungs of infected animals. TCID50 of PR8 maintained a bias toward a Th2 response with higher levels of PR8-specific IgG1 antibody. LEAPS treatment results in decreased proinflammatory cytokines and increased Th1 cytokines in the lungs of PR8-infected mice. we administered NP-LEAPS\u2013 or NP-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs to PR8-infected mice 24 hours after infection. enumerated influenza NP-specific (NP147\u2013155) CD8+ T cells in lungs harvested on day 4 after infection. NP-LEAPS treatment results in early recruitment of influenza-specific T cells into the lungs of mice. the percentage (B) and number (C) of CD8+NP147\u2013155 pentamer+ T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. the error bars represent SEM for each group, P 0.05; Student\u2019s t test. ar cells, primarily macrophages and lymphocytes, were histologically normal. mononuclear cell infiltration in NP-LEAPS\u2013treated mice was associated with reduced lung virus titers and enhanced survival. depletion of CD8+ T cells reduces the effectiveness of influenza-J-LEAPS treatment. NP-LEAPS DC treatment is effective in treating oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus\u2013infected mice. mice were orally gavaged with 20 mg/kg/d of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir) for 5 days starting 4 hours before infection. oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus compared to oseltamivir-treated mice. oseltamivir failed to reduce replication of the virus in the lungs of infected animals. infected, untreated control, and oseltamivir-treated mice lost weight rapidly. peptide-conjugated LEAPS stimulates the maturation of DCs. these are important for antigen presentation and are critical for T cell activation. the lack of immunological reagents is a major obstacle to studying the efficacy of influenza-J-LEAPS DCs in humans. depletion of CD8+ T cells in vivo reduced efficacy of influenza-J-LEAPS treatment. it is likely that coupling peptides to the 2-microglobulin subunit of MHC class I (J-LEAPS ligand) increases stability of the MHC/peptide complex (11\u201313) thereby eliciting strong T cell responses in treated animals. we found that HA-conjugated LEAPS did not induce maturation of DCs. this may explain the reduced ability of the peptide-conjugated LEAPS DCs to stimulate T cell responses. this result suggests that the ability of peptide-conjugated LEAPS to induce DC maturation is critical for success of LEAPS treatment. the delivery of NP-LEAPS, M2e-LEAPS, and combined-LEAPS\u2013pulsed DCs reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines associated with influenza virus\u2013induced pathology (20). this effect is similar to treatment with S1P1 agonists that suppress cytokine and chemokine production in the lungs of influenza-infected mice (28\u201332). human peripheral blood monocytes can produce IL-12p70, MCP1, MCP2 and Rantes within 24 hours without the need for GM-CSF or GM-CSF + IL-4. we have demonstrated the benefits of treatment with LEAPS-loaded DCs on influenza virus infection in a small animal model. the influenza-J-LEAPS were synthesized and purified by CEL-SCI. the influenza-J-LEAPS consist of an immune cell\u2013binding ligand, DLLKNGERIEKVE, conjugated to a peptide from the NP, M2, or HA protein of influenza A virus. nonadherent cells were removed on day 2 and adherent cells were washed and re-fed with fresh complete medium containing 20 ng/ml murine GM-CSF every 2 days. the cells were used as the source of DCs in subsequent experiments. cells were stained with CD3-PerCP, CD19-PE, class II-PE, CD86-APC, and F4/80-FITC. pentamers were loaded with peptides corresponding to residues 147 to 155 of nucleocapsid protein NP. TYQRTRALV-conjugated PE was purchased from ProImmune. mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and inoculated i.n. with 50 l of 106 TCID50 A/Bethesda/NIH107-D31/2009 (H1N1), an oseltamivir-resistant virus. a group of mice (n = 15) was given 107 cells of NP-LEAPS\u2013stimulated DCs 24 hours after infection after oseltami the significance of differences between different groups was assessed with the unpaired Student\u2019s t test and log-rank (Mantel-cox) test using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) P 0.05 was considered significantly different. all animal studies were approved by the NIAID, NIH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the influenza-J-LEAPS consist of an immune cell\u2013binding ligand, DLLKNGERIEKVE, conjugated to a peptide from the NP, M2, or HA protein of influenza A virus. BMDCs were generated as previously described (37, 38) with some modifications. 107 cells/ml were incubated with 5 M CFSE (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes. labeled cells were washed twice with PBS/0.1% BSA and resuspended in sterile PBS. weighed, and homogenized in L-15 medium (Hyclone) to prepare a 10% (w/v) tissue homogenate. the homogenates were clarified by low-speed centrifugation. the viral titers determined on MDCK monolayers were expressed as log10TCID50/g of tissue. phosphate (20 mg/kg/d by twice-daily oral gavage) was initiated 4 hours before infection. a group of mice (n = 15) was given 107 cells of NP-LEAPS\u2013stimulated DCs 24 hours after infection i.v. in combination with oseltamivir phosphate treatment by oral gavage."}
