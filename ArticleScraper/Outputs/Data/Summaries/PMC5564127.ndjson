UC has become a global emergence disease with increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide. Typical symptoms include abdominal pain, tenesmus, bloody diarrhea, passage of pus, mucus, or both, urgency, weight loss, and fever. UC often requires life-long maintenance therapy for relieving symptoms. uxinye has been widely used for treating ulcerative and inflammatory diseases [18, 19] due to its sound effects on anti-inflammatory and recovery of gastrointestinal mucosal. animal studies have suggested that the therapeutic effect of Kangfuxinye may be due, at least in part, to its stimulatory effect on nonspecific cellular defense mechanisms [20], making it one of the most addressed therapies for UC. ological factors were judged to downgrade or upgrade the quality of evidence. observational studies, quasi-randomized controlled trials (Q-RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were excluded. 2.1.2. Types of Participants Participants (male/female) diagnosed with UC and who met the indications for using Kangfuxinye as enema. critical for making a decision and included in the evidence profile. not important for making a decision and not included in the evidence profile. if unavailable, we extracted mean scores of baseline and endpoint as well as the SDs. consensus was obtained by discussion or by consulting the third reviewer (D-Y K) there was no disagreement between the reviewers on the risk of bias. subgroup analyses were carried out where available to investigate possible heterogeneity. a random-effects model was applied to pool overall effect estimate. a funnel plot or Egger's regression test was generated to detect potential publication bias. taking mesalamine alone served as the control. Any mode of the mesalamine was eligible for this review. 5. clinicians specialized in UC from west china hospital. 5 clinicians specialized in UC from west china hospital consulted to identify possible outcomes relating to the UC's efficacy and safety. the results were then used to generate a mean score with standard deviation (SD) for each outcome. the importance of each outcome was classified according to the mean score. the search terms used were \u201cKangfuxinye\u201d; \u201cMesalamine\u201d; and \u201culcerative colitis\u201d in Chinese or English. conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts were retrieved to identify unpublished studies. if unavailable, we extracted mean scores of baseline and endpoint as well as the SDs. consensus was obtained by discussion or by consulting the third reviewer (D-Y K) subgroup analyses were carried out where available to investigate possible heterogeneity and its impact on the robustness of study results. a funnel plot or egger's regression test was generated to detect potential publication bias. results Our searches identified 202 potentially relevant studies.
