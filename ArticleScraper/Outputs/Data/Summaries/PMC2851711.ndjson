{"summary": "158 hospital workers took the course and were randomly assigned to the short version. participants who under-utilized coping via problem-solving or seeking support experienced improved coping. a \"dose-finding\" study tested the feasibility and effectiveness of a less expensive alternative. observations made during and after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggested that emerging infectious disease causes stress in healthcare settings because of fear of contagion [5-7], concern for family health [6,8,9], job stress [6,7], interpersonal isolation [6,7], quarantine [10] and perceived stigma [7,10,11] evidence suggests psychosocial support and training should be provided to affected healthcare workers prior to a pandemic to build resilience [12], thereby reducing the impact of stress after exposure the best goals of training would be to increase confidence in being well-supported by the hospital and well-prepared for the pandemic. enhancing self-efficacy should be a goal of training because it is expected to be a proximal predictor of behavior [22]. an influenza pandemic, resilience training should be available at reasonable cost on a very large scale. computer-assisted and Internet-based learning technologies have been promoted as effective strategies to facilitate learning. despite growing literature on computer-assisted and internet-based continuing professional education for health professionals, most studies are methodologically weak. based on research in continuing professional education, we expected that the format of the course should address both objective and perceived learning needs. the effect of these modes of training on educational outcomes of Internet-based training has been inconsistent, although practice of prescribed exercises more consistently contributes to skills acquisition [28]. the study was conducted from September 2008 to January 2009. participants were randomized to one of three course lengths: short, medium or long. the course was accessed on a computer flash drive rather than via the internet. interactive reflective exercises consisted of four parts. participants watched a 1-3 minute video dramatization of a pandemic-related scenario. participants described responses to the scenario by completing the stems of 3 sentences. each reflective exercise can be completed in less than 5 minutes. participants rate the degree to which they experience interpersonal problems on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) ted, Nonassertive, Overly Accommodating, Self-Sacrificing, and Intrusive/Needy are calculated as the mean of 4 items. the IIP has adequate test-retest reliability, convergence to an established measure of interpersonal styles, and responsiveness to changes in psychotherapy. the Pandemic Influenza Stress Vaccine The course consisted of modules incorporating different modalities of learning. participants watched a 1-3 minute video dramatization of a pandemic-related scenario designed to be realistic and stressful. participants described responses by completing the stems of 3 sentences. reflective exercise can be completed in less than 5 minutes. participants receive feedback in form of a brief narrative description of their \"reflective path\" each reflective exercise can be completed in less than 5 minutes. interpersonal problems were measured with the 32-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32) participants rate the degree to which they experience interpersonal problems on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) each of the eight subscales of the IIP are calculated as the mean of 4 items. analysis Drop-out rates were calculated as proportions and between-group differences in proportions were tested with Pearson's chi-square. subjects who dropped out between T1 and T2 were assigned T1 values of outcome variables at T2. pre-post differences were expressed as mean and 95% confidence interval of means. 158 hospital workers started the course, 127 completed it. there was no significant difference between mid-course drop-outs and course completers. the trend to greater drop-outs with longer course was nonsignificant. there was a significant pre-post decrease in problems with being cold-distancing (n = 104, pre: 0.9 SD 0.8; post 0.8 0.8; 95% CI of difference -0.2 - 0.0, p = 0.02) and self-centered (n = 99, pre: 1.0 SD 0.9; post 0.8 0.9; 95% CI of difference -0.2 - 0.0, p = 0.001) but no significant change in controlling behavior. 5.6 -3.7 -5.1 -2.3 0.001 Ways of Coping Problem-solving 1.5 0.7 1.5 0.7 0.4 0.6 0.0 -0.1 0.0 0.95 Seeking support 1.5 0.7 1.4 0.6 0.0 -0.1 0.0 0.95 Escape-avoidance 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.5 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.06 1 Significance of pre-post differences by paired t-tests, based on intention to treat. total interpersonal problems decreased for participants of the medium and long courses but not for those who took the short course. between-group differences in change scores were not statistically significant. study suggests interactive computer-assisted training for healthcare workers is feasible. in this study, there were specific improvements for all participants in most dimensions of interpersonal problems. participants differ from psychotherapy patients in that they are not selected for having psychiatric disorder and, in fact, report mild interpersonal problems. the medium length course is sufficient for significant improvements in pandemic self-efficacy, confidence in support and training, and interpersonal problems. this study leaves unanswered the question of whether modest improvements in self-efficacy, confidence in support and training are sufficient to reduce pandemic-related stress. a modified version of the medium length course is compared to (i) a knowledge-based course with similar content and duration but without the reflective interactive exercises. this trial will allow testing of the hypothesis that reflective exercises are necessary for the course's benefits and will allow for longer term (6 month) follow-up. authors' contributions RGM conceived of the study, performed the analysis and drafted the manuscript.
