{"summary": "Equine herpesvirus type 1 is a major cause of respiratory, neurologic and reproductive disease in horses worldwide. the virus is a significant equine pathogen, but current EHV-1 vaccines are only partially protective and effective metaphylactic and therapeutic agents are not available. more replication of EHV-1 can occur in endothelia of blood vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) and the uterus, where vasculitis can lead to myeloencephalopathy or abortion. horses traveling to competitions and coming into contact with new animals are at risk of shedding or contracting the virus, making this viral infection a huge concern for the performance horse industry. mediated by small interfering RNA's (siRNA's) is an important defense mechanism against viral infections in plants. siRNA's bind to complementary target mRNA and, upon interaction with the cellular RNA interference mechanisms, will specifically target these sequences for degradation, resulting in inhibition of protein expression. siRNA's against these proteins were synthesized and evaluated for their effectiveness to reduce EHV-1 replication. sigB3, directed against gB mRNA, efficiently reduced viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. sigB3 reduced viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. controls cells were either not transfected with siRNA or were transfected with 75 pmol siGFP or siLuc before infection with rAb4gp2. eGFP-expressing strain rAb4gp2 was used for in vitro studies because eGFP expression allows for ready identification of infected cells. the relative quantity of gB or Ori mRNA was reduced by more than 90% following sigB3 or Ori2 treatment. no significant difference in gB or Ori mRNA levels in cells was observed. the effectiveness of silencing gB was also evaluated at the protein level by western blot analysis. cell lysates from non-infected RK13 cells were included as a control. treatment with siRNA targeting two essential EHV-1 genes has an additive effect on reduction of EHV-1 replication in vitro. gB3 and siOri2 showed the same effectiveness in reducing EHV-1 infectivity, but at a much lower concentration than either siRNA by itself. siRNA combinations against human respiratory viruses have limited capacity to assemble the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) on transfected siRNA. a possible explanation could be that both siRNA's compete for the available RISC pool present in the cell and as such inhibit each other at higher concentrations. targeting multiple genes simultaneously is as effective in reducing viral replication as when one gene is targeted. in one set of experiments, cells were first infected with rAb4gp2 and transfected with the different siRNA's 1 h later. the last set of in vitro experiments evaluated the efficacy of siRNA addition in function of time. siRNA reduces clinical sings and viral replication in a murine model of EHV-1 infection. mice were anaesthetized and inoculated intranasally with siRNA's. mice were anaesthetized and inoculated intranasally with siRNA's. 0.5 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 I siLuc (250) 24 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 K siLuc (250) 12 h before I lipofectamine Ab4

EHV-1 genes 0.5 h before infection also lost weight during the first 2 days p.i. this weight loss only reached a maximum of 10% for the mice treated with 187.5 pmol siOri2 and the combination sigB3/siOri2. mice treated with 187.5 pmol siOri2 and 62.5 pmol sigB3/siOri2 lost up to 15% of their body weight and took until day 14 p. the lungs of mice treated with control siLuc had the most pronounced hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium at day 2 p.i., the most necrotic cells in the airway lumina, the most inclusion bodies as well as the most significant interstitial inflammation. lungs of mice treated with sigB3 were slightly less affected compared to the siLuc control group. mice inoculated with control siLuc had titers around 3103 PFU/mg lung tissue on day 2 p.i.. titers in lungs of mice treated 0.5 h before infection with sigB3 and siOri2 showed a significant reduction in viral titers with an average of 3102 PFU/mg lung tissue. siRNA therapy is effective in vivo by reducing clinical symptoms in challenge-infected animals. mice were transfected intranasally with sigB3 and siOri2 alone or in combination. mice were infected intranasally with 1105 PFU of Ab4 0.5 h later. a second experiment in mice was performed without a transfection vehicle. the siRNA combination of 62.5 pmol sigB3/siOri2 was evaluated. this treatment group was shown to significantly reduce both weight loss and virus replication in the lungs. viral loads in lungs were determined by viral titrations and qPCR in five mice per group on day 3 p.i. no significant reduction in virus titers was observed in animals treated with siRNA's 24 h post infection (p = 0.9) treatment with siRNA's after infection is also efficient in reducing EHV-1 replication. treatment with siRNA targeting glycoprotein B or the origin-binding protein helicase is effective in reducing EHV-1 replication in vitro EHV-1 glycoprotein B (gB), an envelope protein essential for viral entry into cells and cell-to-cell spread [18], and origin-binding protein (ori) helicase, an enzyme necessary for EHV-1 genome replication [19], were chosen as possible targets for RNA interference. supernatants were collected 24 h p.i. from sigB3- and siOri2-transfected cells. viral titers were determined with standard plaque assays. cells were fixed with 10% formalin. rAb4gp2 does not express luciferase, we did not observe any effect on eGFP expression. the relative quantity of gB or Ori mRNA was reduced by more than 90% following sigB3 or Ori2 treatment. RT-PCR was used to determine relative levels of gB or Ori (white bars) or EHV-1 IR6 (grey bars) mRNA, using rabbit -actin as the endogenous housekeeping gene. at 12 h p.i., RNA was extracted from infected cells. a combination of higher concentrations of sigB3 and siOri2 (p0.05) was less effective in reducing viral titers than the lower concentration of 6.25 pmol each. a possible explanation could be that both siRNA's compete for the available RISC pool present in the cell and as such inhibit each other at higher concentrations. viral titers were determined with standard plaque assays. sigB3 and siOri2 at a concentration of 75 pmol reduced viral replication when applied at any time between 12 h prior to and up to 1 h after infection. there was no significant difference at all time points tested between the control treatments that included cells treated with siGFP, siLuc or no siRNA. in vitro experiments clearly showed that siRNA treatment is not only effective in reducing EHV-1 replication when used before infection, but is as efficient, if not even more, when applied during or after the onset of EHV-1 replication. a murine model was used to assess whether siRNA treatment is also effective in vivo. i2 (187.5) 0.5 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 E sigB3/siOri2 (31.25/31.25) 0.5 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 G sigB3/siOri2 (31.25/31.25) 24 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 H sigB3/siOri2 (62.5/62.5) 0.5 h before I lipofectamine Ab4 I siLuc (250) 24 h before I mice treated with control siRNA siLuc began losing weight as early as 1 day p.i. and continued to lose weight until day 3 p.i. a maximum weight loss of up to 17% of their original body weights was observed. mice treated with siRNA's targeting EHV-1 genes 0.5 h before infection also lost weight during the first 2 days p.i. the uninfected control group did not show any weight loss. the repeated anesthesia protocols used for intranasal application of siRNA's and virus did not have any effect on weight loss. the lungs of mice treated with control siLuc had the most pronounced hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium at day 2 p.i. the maximum SD's for each group are indicated in brackets. a total lung score was determined at day 2 p.i. in three mice of each group. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. siRNA therapy is effective in vivo by reducing clinical symptoms in challenge-infected animals. in a second experiment, mice were transfected intranasally with sigB3 and siOri2. in a second experiment, mice were infected intranasally with 1105 PFU. d with lipofectamine (closed symbols) or in PBS (open symbols) 6 or 12 h before infection with 1105 PFU of Ab4 (B) mice transfected with 75 pmol siLuc were used as positive controls and viral titers were determined in three mice of each group on day 2 p.i. a reduction in viral genome copies in the lungs of infected mice was observed at 1, 6 and 12 h p.i. a reduction in viral genome copies in the lungs of infected mice was observed at 1, 6 and 12 h p.i. the control group consisted of 15 untreated infected mice. mice were inoculated intranasally with 62.5 pmol sigB3/siOri2 in PBS. viral loads in lung tissues were also measured by qPCR. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between untreated mice and mice inoculated with 62.5 pmol sigB3/siOri2. the application of each siRNA was readily effective, but when combined, a significant reduction in infectivity was already observed when as little as 6.25 pmol of each siRNA per 1106 cells were used. the effective concentration of our siRNA was far below the in vitro siRNA concentrations described for other respiratory pathogens like RSV, parainfluenza virus or SARS coronavirus. mutational changes have been reported for RNA viruses like human immunodeficiency or hepatitis C virus [38], [39], but no such escape mutation was found upon siRNA treatment against other herpesviruses like HSV-2 [15]. also in the present study, sequence analysis of EHV-1 viral DNA isolated from lungs of siRNA\u2013treated infected mice did not show any mutations in the targeted gB and Ori genes. a major bottleneck in the development of siRNA therapy is optimization of the potency and half-life of siRNA's in order to be efficacious in a realistic clinical setting. if siRNA's are applied during an outbreak, the severity of clinical signs of affected horses and the magnitude of nasal shedding could be reduced. tranasal siRNA therapy targeting viral genes important for cell entry and replication is effective in decreasing severity of EHV-1 infection and disease. the findings have important implications in terms of treating and preventing outbreaks of EHV-1. against ORF33 (encoding gB) and ORF53 (encoding the helicase, Ori) were
