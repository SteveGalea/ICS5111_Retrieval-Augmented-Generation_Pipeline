{"summary": "a disease outbreak occurred in a shy albatross colony on albatross island. the disease was characterized by weight loss and death. serum samples and ticks from healthy and affected birds were sent to the CSIRO. RNA extracted from partially purified virus grown in vero cells was used for random PCR amplification. in total, 6.9 Mb of sequence, consisting of 23,617 reads, was obtained and assembled into 722 contigs. a protein-based BLASTX search yielded 10 contigs showing protein sequence identity to SFTSV and some degree of sequence identity to several other members of the family Bunyaviridae. the table summarizes the genetic and sequence features of the genome segments and deduced proteins of HIGV and several selected phleboviruses. it is evident that HIGV is a new member of the genus Phlebovirus. this finding was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide and protein sequences of all 3 genome segments. the % amino acid sequence identity with cognate proteins of HIGV is shown in parentheses. for proteins, the % amino acid sequence identity with cognate proteins of HIGV is shown in parentheses. phleboviruses (SFTSV and HRTV) were responsible for severe disease and death in humans in 4 countries in Asia and North America. however, the particular disease event in the shy albatrosses could not be attributed to HIGV."}
