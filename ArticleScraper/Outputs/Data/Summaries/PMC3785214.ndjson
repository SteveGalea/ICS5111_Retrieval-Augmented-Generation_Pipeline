{"summary": "viroporins are small hydrophobic proteins that oligomerize and form aqueous channels in membranes. in general, viroporins contain one or two hydrophobic transmembrane domains. by inducing membrane perforations in the correct cellular locations, the rhythm of virus reproduction is controlled for optimal spreading. nonenveloped and nonenveloped Viruses Structure Virus Viroporin Amino acid length Proposed stage(s) References Enveloped Influenza virus M2 97 Infection Lamb et al.

(2004) Maturation Release HIV Vpu 81 Release Gonzalez and Carrasco (1998), Schubert et al. entry and penetration Viruses bind to host cell receptors to initiate infection and entry. fusion with a host cell membrane delivers the viral particle into the cytoplasm during infection. nonenveloped viruses contain a protein coat that surrounds their genome. ating of matrix protein M1 and the viral ribonucleoprotein does not occur. the viroporin activity of M2 is inhibited by amantadine. nonenveloped viruses also contain viroporins that facilitate viral penetration. protein VI appears to have membrane disruptive properties that lyse the endosomal membrane by introducing positive membrane curvature rather than forming pores. current results support the hypothesis that VP4 forms ion channels in the endosomal membrane that lead to lysis of the membrane for penetration into the cytoplasm. the reorganized subviral particle is thought to be translocated across the ER membrane as a large intact viral particle. the delivery of the subviral particle into the cytoplasm would require subsequent targeting through nuclear pore complexes. there is no known pore in the inner nuclear membrane, although this route might be mediated by viral components. VP2 and VP3 could serve a role in penetration as in vitro-translated VP2 and VP3 insert into purified ER membranes. mutant viruses lacking the pore formation activity are noninfectious. 2B appears to insert two transmembrane domains into ER membranes. oligomerization of 2B in the membrane forms pores that induce Ca+ leakage from the ER lumen. 2B also contributes to the virus release by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane. p7 and NS2 appear to coordinate the hand off of the viral core. envelope glycoproteins induce fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane to support viral penetration. many viruses are internalized to endosomal compartments where they are activated by the exposure to acidic conditions that mediates membrane fusion. a conserved amphipathic domain is required for this activity. the alphavirus 6K viroporin conducts ions across planar lipid bilayers. synthesis of 6K in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells induces toxicity. the expression of Vpu in mammalian cells or E. coli causes increased permeability to small molecules. this led to the hypothesis that the function of Vpu during viral release is to depolarize the plasma membrane to enhance the release of viral particles. 2B and agnoprotein traffic through the ER and Golgi. NS3, 2B, and agnoprotein appear to directly assist in nonenveloped virus release by forming small pores. agnoprotein from JC polyomavirus disrupts the plasma membrane of infected cells to promote virus release. polyomavirus SV40 encodes for agnoprotein. future work should aim to identify new viroporins. future work should aim to identify new viroporins."}
