{"summary": "PEDV infection is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and a high mortality rate in swine (10, 11) the disease has become more serious and resulted in severe economic losses in China. the complete genome sequences of many wild-type PEDV strains have been determined (1\u20137) of SD-M was 27,953 nucleotides (nt) in length without the poly(A) tail. the genome showed 99.9, 97.8, 97.7, 97.5, 96.9, 97, and 97% nucleotide sequence similarity to those of attenuated DR13, DR13, CV777, CH/S, GD-A, and CH/FJND-3/2001. complete genome sequence of PEDV strain SD-M submitted to GenBank under accession number JX560761."}
