{"summary": "hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. it is classified in the genus Orthohepevirus, the family Hepeviridae. hepatitis E is generally a self-limiting disease with a case fatality rate from 0.5 to 3% in young adults. cross-species infection of HEV from animal reservoirs to humans is thought to be the major cause of sporadic cases of hepatitis E in the industrialized countries. current knowledge for HEV implies a significant underestimation of HEV infection as a public health concern. a portion of a highly conserved RNA-polymerase (RdRp) motif was identified. the virus was designated as HEV, which was responsible for the outbreak of ET-NANBH. the complete sequence of HEV genome was published 1 year later. ORF1 (nt 26\u20135107) is labeled above the genomic RNA box. newly identified ISRE like sequence (nt 2701\u20132787) and ORF4 (nt 2835\u20133308) overlapped with ORF1 are listed. the HEV genome contains two cis-reactive elements (CREs) that are essential for the viral replication. the first CRE overlaps the 3\u2032 end of ORF2 and the 3\u2032 UTR. the second CRE locates in the intergenic region of the HEV genome. all four previously recognized HEV genotypes (1\u20134) belong to the Orthohepevirus A virus (Smith et al., 2014). hepatitis e virus (HEV) genotypes, natural hosts, and zoonotic infection to humans. four genotypes are no longer satisfying classification of expanding HEV isolates. some strains from wild boars in Japan with unique viral nucleotide sequences are designated as genotypes 5 and 6. HEV from camel is classified as genotype 7 of orthohepevirus A (Smith et al., 2016). genotype 2 contains a Mexican strain and variants from africa. the genotype 4 is previously thought to be found only in china. recent reports show genotype 4 strains are also isolated in other countries. hypervariable region (HVR), proline-rich region (Pro), X domain, helicase domain (Hel) and RdRp (Figure 2). the proline-rich region is frequently named together with HVR as the HVR. in Escherichia coli and a cell-free system based on HepG2 cells, ORF1 was expressed as a 186 kDa protein without further processing detected. despite the lack of conclusive data, the majority of studies so far are so far. cleaved ORF1 products could be detected in the HEV-infected cells. a recent study showed intraviral interactome within the domains from ORF1. a recombinant HEV harboring ORF1 of a genotype 4 strain replicated in transfected kidney cells. expression of HEV ORF1 cDNA (aa residues 1\u2013979) yields 110 kDa protein (P110), along with a 80 kDa protein that is believed to be the proteolytic product of P110. Y domain is assumed to start from aa residue 216 and ends at aa 442. the mutation of six cystine residues in the PCP domain abolished HEV RNA replication in a replicon system in S10-3 cells. this leads to the speculation that whether HEV PCP is a real cysteine protease. this leads to the speculation that whether HEV PCP is a real cysteine protease. some ubiquitin-like molecules, such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), have been described. similar research performed on the HEV PCP domain suggests that it acts as an antagonist to ISG15 function to inhibit host innate immunity. the length and sequence of HVR and Pro is highly variable among different HEV strains. some of the recent publications designated the region of aa 712\u2013778 as the hypervariable domain. some of the recent publications designated the region of aa 712\u2013778 as the hypervariable domain. Kernow-C1 was originally isolated from an HIV-positive patient with chronic HEV infection. it contains an insertion of a 174 nt gene fragment of human ribosomal protein S17 in the Pro region. this recombinant virus was adapted in culture cells and is able to propagate in cells from different species. the heterogeneity of the pro and X domains is implicated in HEV persistence. the heterogeneity of the pro and X domains is implicated in HEV persistence. the macro domain inhibits transcription and binds to the transcription activator NF-B. the macro domain is involved in downstream processing of ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphate. the macro domain is found in association with proteins involved in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerization, ADP-ribosylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. information about the function of viral macro domains is limited. lan equine encephalitis virus can reverse protein ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates. other studies indicate that the expression of viral macro domain in liver cells inhibits apoptosis since it is functionally related to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. RNA helicase domain is downstream of the X domain. it is encoded by many positive-stranded RNA viruses. helicases are motor proteins that can unwind nucleic acid strands. motifs I, IV, and VI are dispensable, while motifs I and III are dispensable. a V239A substitution in the helicase domain of a swine HEV strain is potentially associated with increased virulence. no human infection was reported to be associated with this strain. in the HEV RdRp is possibly due to ribavirin-induced mutagenesis. it is associated with treatment failure of ribavirin monotherapy in solid-organ transplant patients. aa 137, aa 310, aa 562) prevent formation of viral particles and infection of rhesus macaques. mutants in the putative glycosylation sites prevent formation of viral particles. mutation of the third site allows virion particle formation. lecular mass of 50 kDa lacks the first 111 aa and the last 52 aa of ORF2 polypeptide but retains the ability to form virus-like particles. a 3.5- resolution crystal structure obtained from HEV VLP indicates that the truncated HEV capsid protein has three domains designated as S (shell, aa 129\u2013319), M (middle, aa 320\u2013455), and P (protrud a study manipulating a phage display system maps the major neutralizing domain to residues 458\u2013607. both conformational and linear neutralizing epitopes have been identified from the HEV capsid protein. vaccination of pigs with truncated capsid proteins derived from swine, rat and chicken HEV elicits partial protection against a genotype 3 mammalian HEV. capsid protein activates pro-apoptotic gene CHOP, increases expression of HSP72, HSP70B and HSP40. capsid protein interacts with -TRCP, a component of the ubiquitination complex that inhibits NF-B activation. VP13 contains two hydrophobic domains in its N-terminal half and two proline-rich domains in its C-terminal portion. a phosphorylation site (Ser71) was identified in the first proline-rich domain and can be phosphorylated by MAP kinase. SH3 domains comprise of about 60 residues and proteins containing SH3 domains typically play a role in signaling pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation and other regulatory functions. only the PXXP motif in the second proline-rich region is known to interact with SH3 domains. continuous amino acid motif, VDLP, at the C-terminus of genotype 4 HEV VP13, is a core sequence of a VP13 epitope. VP13 is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. it is indispensable for HEV infection in vivo. VP13 delays the trafficking and degradation of the activated hepatocyte growth factor receptor to prolong endomembrane growth factor signaling. a recent study identified the Met, PCP, X, Helicase, and RdRp domains as interacting partners for VP13 as well. salt extraction studies have suggested that the VP13-microtubule interaction is electrostatic and motor protein dynein is needed for the interaction. VP13 cannot be co-precipitated with tubulin by anti-tubulin antibody. this microtubule-like distribution of VP13 suggests that it may play a role in promoting virus egress. the PSAP motif in VP13 is required for the formation of membrane-associated HEV particles with the VP13 protein itself associated with lipids. this process is mediated by the cellular Tsg101 protein (Nagashima et al., 2011a,b). VP13 is associated with virion during egress and anti-VP13 antibodies are able to capture HEV virions from the serum and cell culture supernatant. a later study indicates that the Ser71 phosphorylation site is required for the interaction of the capsid protein and VP13 as VP13 can interact with the capsid protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. this finding also supports a role for VP13 in HEV structural assembly. a mutagenesis study shows that HEV lacking the phosphorylation site in VP13 is able to replicate its genome in cultured cells. VP13 of a genotype 3 strain is able to interact with the STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) to inhibit interferon-mediated signaling in A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line; Dong et al., 2012) VP13 plays an indispensable role in infectivity in experimentally infected animals. ORF1 encodes a 1693 amino acid (aa) polyprotein, which is needed for HEV replication. it starts at the 5\u2032 end of the genome after a 25 nt non-coding region. the sequence is highly related to the group of Rubi-like viruses. the current data are conflicting about whether the HEV ORF1 product functions as a single polyprotein or needs to be further processed into smaller units by viral or cellular proteases. one study using a vaccinia-derived expression system demonstrated that the ORF1 polyprotein could be cleaved by the PCP within it. the cleaved ORF1 products could be detected in the HEV-infected cells if effective and specific antibodies are available. the cleaved products could be detected in the HEV-infected cells if effective and specific antibodies against the domains are available. met domain is the first at the N-terminus of the ORF1-encoded polyprotein. the region in aa residues 60\u2013240 was assumed to be a putative methyltransferase. the region in aa residues 60\u2013240 was assumed to be a methyltransferase. there is no information available for the function of this Y domain in either HEV or the rubella virus. the PCP domain is responsible for the proteolytic processing of its NSP. mutation of the putative catalytic core (Cys483) of HEV PCP had no effect on proteolytic processing of the ORF1 product. ed HEV RNA replication in a replicon system in S10-3 cells was previously predicted as putative catalytic residues in the PCP domain. the PCP domain expressed in the E. coli C43 strain (resistant to toxic protein expression) possesses protease activity. aa 712\u2013778 in this region were designated a proline-rich region. aa 712\u2013778 in this region were designated a proline-rich region. some of the recent publications designated the region as the hypervariable domain. deleting part of the HVR domain along with part of the Pro region renders the mutant non-viable. the pro domain is considered to be an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) with flexibility for insertion and deletion. the pro domain is considered highly diverse, but some motifs are found in the IDR. the authors also assessed the diversity of the Pro domain due to the higher rate of substitutions at the first and second codon positions. this pattern matches the aa usage in proline-rich IDRs. X domain homologs in other viruses such as rubella virus, alpha virus and coronavirus. it is also known as macro domain due to its similarity with non-histone domain of the histone macroH2A. early studies of the human macro domain indicate that it is enriched in inactive mammalian X chromosomes. crystal structure analysis and in vitro assays on the macro domain of the SARS virus indicate that the viral macro domain has relatively poor ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphohydrolase activity. the viral macro proteins bind poly (ADP-ribose) and poly (A), but have a low affinity for monomeric ADP-ribose. this implies that viral macro domains are functionally different from human homolog. ella virus protease-substrate mutations in the macro domain are lethal for Sar55 replication in S10-3 cells. further analysis identified the N-terminus residues Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815-Gly816-and Gly817 formed a potential catalytic-site homolog of Coronavirus ADP-ribose-1\u2032-monophosphatase. a recent report suggests that the quasispecies heterogen the HEV helicase belongs to helicase superfamily SF1. it is proposed to possess both NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. it drives the hydrolysis of rNTPs but also dNTPs at a lower efficiency. all eight conserved motifs can be found in HEV RdRp. the purified HEV RdRp is able to bind the 3\u2032 end of HEV RNA. the emergence of G1634R mutation in the HEV RdRp is possibly due to ribavirin-induced mutagenesis. the HEV Met domain is similar to that of Tricornaviruses. there are an invariant His residue, an AspXXArg signature and an invariant Tyr residue in methyltransferase motifs I, II, and IV. expression of HEV ORF1 cDNA yields a 110 kDa protein (P110) mutation of the putative catalytic core (Cys483) of HEV PCP had no effect on proteolytic processing of the ORF1 product (Ropp et al., 2000; Ropp et al., 2000; Ropp et al., 2000; Sehgal et al., 2006; Suppiah et al., 2011). this leads to the speculation that whether HEV PCP is a real cysteine protease chymotrypsin-like protease suggests that HEV PCP is a real protease for HEV ORF1 polyprotein processing. ubiquitination and innate immunity signaling have been demonstrated in recent years. aa 712\u2013778 in this region were designated a proline-rich region. it was also considered to serve as a hinge between the X domain and its upstream domains. deleting part of the HVR domain along with part of the Pro region renders the mutant non-viable. deletion and mutation of this region in HEV indicates that it is not required for viral replication and infectivity, but it plays a role in replication efficiency in vitro. the pro domain is interchangeable between genotypes with genotype-specific differences (Pudupakam et al., 2011). homogeneity of the pro and X domains is implicated in HEV persistence. heterogeneity of the pro and X domains is implicated in HEV persistence. X domain is located immediately downstream of the Pro domain. early studies of the human macro domain indicate that it is enriched in inactive mammalian X chromosomes. the macro domain inhibits transcription and binds to the transcription activator NF-B. a biochemical functional analysis indicates that the macro domain is involved in downstream processing of ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphate. the viral macro proteins bind poly (ADP-ribose) and poly (A), but have a low affinity for monomeric ADP-ribose. this implies that viral macro domains are functionally different from human homolog and may participate in cellular pathways involving RNA. RNA helicase domain is downstream of the X domain. it is encoded by many positive-stranded RNA viruses. helicases are motor proteins that are able to unwind nucleic acid strands. RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity has also been observed in the HEV helicase domain, which is proposed to function along with methyltransferase for catalyzing RNA capping. motifs I, IV, and III are dispensable while motifs I and III are crucial and unique for HEV helicase function. expression of the RdRp in mammalian cells as a GFP fusion protein indicates that it localizes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) emergence of G1634R mutation in the HEV RdRp is possibly due to ribavirin-induced mutagenesis and is associated with treatment failure of ribavirin monotherapy in solid-organ transplant patients. mutagenesis study indicated that the N-terminal signal peptide is required for its cell surface expression via ER transition. but glycosylation of the capsid protein is not required. it is not known whether these modifications have biological significance for HEV infection. a 62 kDa product is detected while lacking the first 111 aa residues of the putative ORF2 polypeptide. further studies in two different insect cell lines (SF9 and Tn5) show a soluble form of ORF2 product with a molecular mass of 50 kDa. it lacks the first 111 aa and the last 52 aa residues of the putative ORF2 polypeptide. the ORF2 product expressed in insect cells is reactive with anti-HEV antibodies. genetic analysis of ORF2 showed over 85% similarity among the four major HEV genotypes in mammalian hosts. a recent study suggests that antigenic composition and immunoreactivity differed between HEV recombinant capsid proteins from different genotypes. a recent study suggests that antigenic composition and immunoreactivity differed between HEV recombinant capsid proteins from different genotypes. a later study based on an HEV replicon shows that ORF3 is translated from the bicistronic subgenomic RNA and initiates at the third AUG of the presumed ORF3. the protein is a protein with 113 or 114 aa and molecular size of 13 kDa (VP13), which is 9 aa shorter than the earlier predicted version. VP13 is unique and has no similarity to any other proteins known. unique motif reacts with a genotype 1 VP13-specific monoclonal antibody. this proline-rich region contains residues PMSPLR, a typical motif (PXXPX+) for class II SRC homology 3 (SH3) domains. the next proline-rich region spanning aa 95\u2013102 are RPSAPPLP. VP13 is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. VP13 can bind to inactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase. VP13 inhibits nuclear translocation of STAT3 and down-regulates STAT3-mediated gene expression. microarray analysis of Huh7 cells with VP13 expression suggests liver-specific genes can be modulated. VP13 can also up-regulate mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel genes. this result implies that VP13 is able to inhibit the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. VP13 leads to an elevation of acetylated -tubulin, indicating increased microtubule stability. truncation analysis indicated that both hydrophobic domains are required for its association with the microtubules. salt extraction studies have suggested that the VP13 interaction is electrostatic and motor protein dynein is needed for the interaction. the requirement of VP13 for virion release was confirmed by a cell culture-adapted strain with VP13 deletion. the intact PSAP motif in VP13 is required for the formation of membrane-associated HEV particles with the VP13 protein itself associated with lipids. this process is mediated by the cellular Tsg101 protein itself associated with lipids. viral particles could lose lipid-associated VP13 after passing through the gut. VP13 can be phosphorylated at Ser71 by MAPK when expressed in COS1 and Huh7 cells. a mutagenesis study shows that VP13 lacking the phosphorylation site in VP13 is able to replicate its genome in cultured cells. VP13 extends RIG-I half-life and interacts with the N-terminal portion of RIG-I to enhance its activation by polyI:C. genotypes 1 and 3 VP13 but not genotypes 2 and 4 VP13 have the role, implicating that VP13 may relate to HEV virulence and pathogenesis. VP13 plays an indispensable role in infectivity in experimentally infected animal models. analysis of HEV sequences from other genotypes suggests ORF4 is not conserved across genotypes. aa 458\u2013607 located in the C-terminal region of the capsid protein (M domain) may be the candidate receptor for HEV entry. a recent report suggests the quasi-enveloped HEV particles enter cells via a distinct pathway that involves in degradation of the lipid membrane in the lysosome. after uncoating, the HEV capsid is uncoated by unknown mechanisms. this suggests that HSP90 may play a role in the intracellular transport of HEV particles. a group from Japan reports that HEV isolate 87A is able to replicate in A549 cells. however, PCR was also used to detect viral RNA in the cell culture supernatant. another group also showed that the A549 cell line could be used effectively for passaging two Chinese HEV isolates. a genotype 4 HEV from a fulminant hepatitis patient can grow in LC/PRF/5 and A549 cells and reach a titer of 1.3 107 copies/ml within 10\u201320 days incubation period. a human hepatoma-derived cell line HepaRG and a porcine embryonic stem cell-derived cell line PICM-19 were shown to support HEV replication. replication of Kernow-C1 p6 is 7.5-fold higher in HepG2/C3A human hepatoma cells than in Huh7.5, PLC/PRF/5, A549, Caco-2 or rhesus kidney cells. this HEV isolate is also able to infect a variety of non-primate cells, including cow, mouse, chicken, cat, dog, and rabbit cells. hepatitis E is highly endemic in East and South Asia. hepatitis E accounts for 20\u201350% of acute hepatitis cases in this region. HEV accounts for 20\u201360% of sporadic acute hepatitis and fulminant liver failure in this region. the rates of fulminant liver failure are usually higher in pregnant patients. in developed countries, such as north America, western Europe and Japan, no outbreaks have been reported. genotype 1 is responsible for most endemic and epidemic cases of hepatitis E in Asia. there is no known animal reservoir for HEV genotypes 1 and 2. there is no known animal reservoir for HEV genotypes 3 and 4. an investigation on pregnancy outcomes in hepatitis E shows higher HEV loads in pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. a recent study highlights the role of TLR3 and IFN- in HEV pathogenesis. patients with lower expression of TLR3 and IFN- progress to acute liver failure. HIV-infected individuals have higher positive rate of anti-HEV antibody than individuals without HIV infection. extrahepatic manifestations have been documented in patients with acute and chronic HEV infections. current tests mainly target anti-HEV antibodies, including IgG and IgM. however, several assays are based on antigens expressed by a single HEV genotype, especially genotype 3, and might be limited for the detection of all HEV genotypes. treatment and Prevention of HEV Infection Hepatitis E virus infection mainly causes a self-limited disease. the rate can increase to 30% in pregnant women during third trimester of gestation in south Asia. off-label application of ribavirin as monotherapy for HEV has demonstrated promising results in both acute and chronic hepatitis E patients. PPMOs are water soluble, nuclease-resistant single-stranded DNA analogs. PPMOs interfere with translation through steric blockade of the AUG-translation initiating region. PPMOs distribute to liver, remain pharmacologically viable. PPMOs are appealing for consideration as a novel inhibitor of HEV infections. siRNA targeting a 3\u2032 cis-acting element and viral nucleotide sequences coding for helicase and RdRp are effective against HEV in HepG2 cells. esaa 368\u2013606 of ORF2 product, is a 26 kDa truncated protein expressed in E. coli. the vaccine is well-tolerated with an efficacy of 100% protection after three doses in a population tested in china. the vaccine was approved and marketed in china in 2012. further investigation is needed to elucidate the basic biology of HEV. recent discoveries about the antigenicity variation between HEV genotypes and quasi-enveloped viral particles hidden from neutralizing antibody suggest new challenges. edward et al."}
