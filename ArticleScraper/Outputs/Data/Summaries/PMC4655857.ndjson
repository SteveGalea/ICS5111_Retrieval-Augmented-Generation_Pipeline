{"summary": "293T cells and Huh-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Science. the EMC/2012 strain of MERS-CoV (passage 8, designated MERS-CoV), provided by Drs Bart Haagmans and Ron Fouchier (EMC), was passaged once on Vero 81 cells. fluorescence N-PAGE (FN-PAGE) was carried out in the same manner described above for N-PAGE, except using fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013conjugated peptide (HR2P-F) gels were imaged using a FluorChem 8800 Imaging system with excitation wavelength at 302 nm and emission wavelength at 520 nm. 293T/MERS/EGFP (or 293T/MERS-Q1020H/EGFP) and 293T/EGFP cells (1 104) were incubated with Huh-7 cells expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (5 104) as target cells. the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using the CalcuSyn software. animal experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. mice were transduced intranasally with 2.5 108 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of Ad5-hDPP4 in 75 L of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) five days after transduction, mice were infected intranasally with wild-type (WT) or mutant MERS-CoV. the resulting BAC clone was termed pBAC-MERS-CoV Q1020R/H. the resulting BAC clone was termed pBAC-MERS-CoV Q1020R/H. gels were imaged using a FluorChem 8800 Imaging system. gel stained with Coomassie blue and reimaged. inhibition of MERS-CoV S protein\u2013mediated cell-cell fusion tested. 293T/MERS/EGFP and 293T/EGFP cells (1 104) were incubated with Huh-7 cells expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (5 104) as target cells, in the absence or presence of test peptides at the indicated concentrations for 2\u20134 hours at 37\u00b0C. mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute and the Jackson Laboratory. all studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals from the National Institutes of health. the resulting BAC clone was termed pBAC-MERS-CoV Q1020R/H. the resulting BAC clone was termed pBAC-MERS-CoV Q1020R/H. HR2P-M2 was about 0.9\u20132.6-fold more potent in inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein bearing Q1020H and Q1020R. this was present in nearly all strains [29, 30]. HR2P-M2 was 5\u20138-fold more effective at inhibiting infection by the pseudoviruses carrying mutant S protein (Q1020H or Q1020R) than infection by the pseudovirus carrying the WT S protein. CP-1 showed no inhibition of either mutant MERS-CoV pseudovirus. the complexes formed between HR1 and HR2 peptides showed low -helicity (approximately 6%), whereas all the HR1 peptides displayed random structures. however, all the complexes formed between HR2P-M2 and the HR1 peptides showed -helical structure with -helicity in the range of 79%\u201388%. HR2P-M2 alone migrated rapidly (lane 4), whereas the mixture of HR2P-M2 and HR1P or its mutants migrated more slowly in the gel (lanes 9\u201311). both HR2P-M2 and HR2P-F interact with HR1P and its mutants to form 6-HB. fluorescence bands in the gel were first imaged using a transillumination UV light source. we subsequently assessed the ability of HR2P-M2 to inhibit 6-HB formation between MERS-CoV HR1 and HR2 peptides. titers in the lungs of mice challenged with recombinant MERS-CoV peaked at about 106, 105, and 105 PFUs/g. titers in the lungs of mice treated with HR2P-M2 and challenged with WT, Q1020R, and Q1020H MERS-CoV were decreased to 103 PFUs/g. data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 3\u20134 mice per experiment. data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 3\u20134 mice per experiment. mice were challenged with MERS-CoV, and viral titers were measured 72 hours after infection. titers were significantly reduced in all treated groups, with complete clearance observed in mice treated with IFN-/HR2P-M2. mice were infected with 1 105 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of MERS-CoV. at 12 hours and 36 hours after infection, mice were treated intranasally with 2000 U of IFN-, 200 g of HR2P-M2, both IFN- (2000 U) and HR2P-M2 (200 g) data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 4 mice per group per experiment. Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 1 105 PFUs MERS-CoV in a total volume of 50 L of DMEM. at 12 and 36 hours after infection, mice were treated intranasally with 100 L of PBS containing 2000 U of IFN-, 200 g of HR2P-M2, both IFN- and HR2P-M2 (200 g), respectively. the lungs of MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice showed perivascular, peribronchial, and interstitial infiltrates, as well as alveolar septa thickening. however, infiltration was moderately reduced in mice treated with IFN- and HR2P-M2 alone. pathological changes were most attenuated in the IFN-/HR2P-M2\u2013treated group. ERS-CoV S protein\u2013mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by Pseudoviruses in HR1 domain. peptide HR2P-M2 and HR2P inhibited fusion in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 values of 0.55 and 0.97 mol/L indicated that HR2P-M2 has improved membrane fusion inhibitory activity compared with HR2P. HR2P-M2 was about 0.9\u20132.6-fold more potent in inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein bearing Q1020H and Q1020R, respectively, than the WT S protein of the EMC/2012 strain. CP-1 exhibited no inhibition at concentrations up to 20. HR2P-M2 was about 5\u20138-fold more effective at inhibiting infection by the pseudoviruses carrying mutant S protein (Q1020H or Q1020R) than infection by the pseudovirus carrying the WT S protein. CP-1 showed no inhibition of either mutant MERS-CoV pseudovirus. spectroscopic analysis shows the secondary structure of the complexes formed by HR2P-M2 peptide and HR1P (A), HR1P-Q1020H (B), or HR1P-Q1020R (C) the circular dichroism spectra are shown for the individual peptides and complexes in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 4\u00b0C. both HR2P-M2 and HR2P-F interact with HR1P and its mutants to form 6-HB. the gel was then stained with coomassie blue and imaged again with the FluorChem 8800 Imaging System. HR2P-M2 (200 g) or PBS (control) was intranasally administered to Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced mice 6 hours before challenge with 1 105 PFUs of MERS-CoV. recombinant MERS-CoV carrying Q1020R or Q1020H mutations in the S protein. protein peaked at about 106, 105, and 105 PFUs/g. titers in the lungs of mice treated with HR2P-M2 and challenged with WT, Q1020R, and Q1020H MERS-CoV were decreased to 103 PFUs/g. the limit of detection was 102 PFUs/g. treated and HR2P-M2\u2013treated groups in WT MERS-CoV, Q1020H-MERS-CoV or Q1020R-MERS-CoV\u2013infected C56BL/6 mice. intranasal application of HR2P-M2 and IFN- in combination, before or after Viral Challenge, demonstrated the emergence of resistance in the HR1 domain of HIV during prolonged exposure [32] V\u2013infected Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced mice were treated 12 and 36 hours after infection, with PBS, IFN-, HR2P-M2, or IFN-/HR2P-M2. viral titers were measured 96 hours after infection. at 12 hours and 36 hours after infection, mice were treated intranasally with 2000 U of IFN-, 200 g of HR2P-M2, both IFN- (2000 U) and HR2P-M2 (200 g), or PBS only. data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 4 mice per group per experiment. asally with 1 105 PFUs MERS-CoV in a total volume of 50 L of DMEM. mice were treated intranasally with 100 L of PBS (50 + 50 L at 10-minute intervals) containing 2000 U of IFN-, 200 g of HR2P-M2, both IFN- and HR2P-M2 (200 g), respectively. after mice were killed on day 7 after infection, lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin, and mice lacking T and B cells were unable to clear MERS-CoV with virus detected in the lungs for 30 days. prophylactic treatment resulted in enhanced virus clearance at 72 hours after infection, with complete virus clearance in 1/8 HR2P-M2 and 4/8 IFN-/HR2P-M2 mice. the combination of ribavirin and IFN-2b administered to rhesus macaques within 8 hours of inoculation resulted in beneficial effects in reducing virus replication, lung injury, and inflammation. this combination was also provided to several severely ill patients, and although it reduced the mortality rate 14 days after treatment, it did not show beneficial effects by 28 days. intranasally treated with HR2P-M2 or IFN- alone or in combination 6 hours before viral challenge, viral titers in lung were significantly reduced. intranasal administration of HR2P-M2, IFN-, and their combination to Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced C57BL/6 and RAG1/ mice at 12 and 36 hours after infection significantly reduced viral titers in all inhibitor-treated groups. pathological changes in the lungs, such as perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial infiltration, and alveolar septa thickening, were moderately reduced in groups treated with IFN- or HR2P-M2 alone. no animals experimentally infected with MERS-CoV develop similar disease severity, to our knowledge. use as a therapeutic agent to treat MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients."}
