{"summary": "equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the family togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. the new world alphaviruses are categorically encephalitic and include eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) multiple RNA viruses use 1 PRF to generate the trans-frame (TF) protein, which shares its N-terminal region with the 6K protein. a study examining the consequences of altering the production, size, or sequence of the TF protein revealed reduced levels of SINV release from both mammalian and mosquito cells. RESULTS Alphavirus-derived sequences promote efficient levels of 1 PRF. the alphavirus genomes consist of a single positive-strand RNA. the 5\u2032 ORF encodes four nonstructural proteins, while five structural proteins are encoded by the 26S subgenomic RNA. mutants harbor slippery site inactivation mutations (ssM), in-frame termination codons prior to the slippery sites (5\u2032 Ter) and 1 frame termination codons 3\u2032 of the virus-derived sequences (3\u2032 1 Ter) were tested. a prior study demonstrated that 1 PRF can be naturally regulated in cells by microRNAs (miRNAs) (15) the resulting frameshift product is an 8.4-kDa protein called the trans-frame protein. the predicted 1 PRF signals derived from EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV were cloned into the dual-luciferase reporter plasmid pJD175f. the 1 PRF signal from HIV-1 was employed as a positive control. control samples were transfected with siRNAs harboring scrambled sequences. a minimum of three or more biological replicates was performed in triplicate. bars represent standard errors of the means. eEV (A), VEEV (B), and WEEV (C) 1 PRF signals were chemically resolved using selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) RNAs for the 1 PRF signal of each alphavirus were transcribed from their reporter plasmids. RNA samples were treated with N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), primer extension reactions were carried out, the reaction mixtures were separated through 8% urea-P a silent protein-coding change was introduced into the VEEV infectious clones for the TC83 vaccine strain and the highly pathogenic Trinidad Donkey strain (21). vero cells were infected with TC83, TC83PRFm, TrD, or TrDPRFm. similar results were observed with C6/36 mosquito cells. ablation of 1 PRF decreases VEEV release in vitro. Schematic diagram indicating silent coding nucleotide substitutions ablating the 1 PRF signals in the VEEV TC83 and TrD infectious clones (VEEVPRFm) ablation of 1 PRF strongly attenuates VEEV pathogenesis. mice were exposed to 1 105 PFU/ml of VEEV TrD or VEEV TrDPRFm. VEEV TrD-infected mice succumbed to infection beginning at 8 days postinfection. virus was detected in the blood and spleen in only 50% of the mice at 2 dpi and in only 60% of the mice at 4 dpi. in contrast, virus was not detectable in the VEEV TrDPRFm-infected mice until 4 dpi and cleared in 80% of those mice by 10 dpi. the data plotted represent means and standard errors of the means for five animals per condition. samples without detectable plaques were plotted as 1 PFU/ml. alphavirus-derived sequences promote efficient levels of 1 PRF. mutants harbor slippery site inactivation mutations (ssM), in-frame termination codons prior to the slippery sites (5\u2032 Ter) and 1 frame termination codons 3\u2032 of the virus-derived sequences (3\u2032 1 Ter) were tested. a prior study demonstrated that 1 PRF can be naturally regulated in cells by microRNAs (miRNAs) (15) a family of viruses harbors 1 PRF signals toward the 3\u2032 end of the 6K structural protein-encoding mRNA. the resulting frameshift product is an 8.4-kDa protein called the trans-frame (TF) protein. control samples were transfected with siRNAs harboring scrambled sequences. a minimum of three or more biological replicates was performed in triplicate. bars represent standard errors of the means. eEV (A), VEEV (B), and WEEV (C) 1 PRF signals were chemically resolved using selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) RNAs for the 1 PRF signal of each alphavirus were transcribed from their reporter plasmids.

Schematic diagram indicating silent coding nucleotide substitutions ablating the 1 PRF signals in the VEEV TC83 and TrD infectious clones. ablation of 1 PRF strongly attenuates VEEV pathogenesis. mice were exposed to 1 105 PFU/ml of VEEV TrD or VEEV TrDPRFm for 10 min. VEEV TrD-infected mice succumbed to infection beginning at 8 days postinfection. virus was not detectable in the VEEV TrDPRFm-infected mice until 4 dpi and was cleared in 80% of those mice by 10 dpi. the results indicate that the dissemination of VEEV TrDPRFm is altered in vivo, resulting in less viral replication within the brain. the data plotted represent means and standard errors of the means for five animals per condition. samples without detectable plaques were plotted as 1 PFU/ml. a VEEV deletion mutant harboring only 32 nucleotides (nt) of sequence stimulated 1 PRF approximately twice as well as VEEV with the native sequence (9). a bioeconomics model emerged in which 1 PRF rates are optimized to maximize virus particle assembly by ensuring the synthesis of the correct stoichiometric ratio of the structural Gag-derived proteins to the enzymes encoded by the Pol open reading frame (ORF) in flaviviruses, the viral positive-strand RNA genome encodes a single ORF in which the structural proteins are encoded by the 5\u2032 third of the genome. in these viruses, the location of the 1 PRF signal in the first nonstructural gene (NS1) has been proposed to ensure the production of large amounts of structural proteins for virus particle assembly and smaller amounts of the nonstructural proteins (6). in alphaviruses, production of the 8.4-kDa TF protein may have two consequences. first, because E1 is a structural protein, 1 PRF may play a role in virion assembly by controlling E1 expression levels. this is supported by the observation that 1 PRF inhibition attenuated VEEV pathogenicity and altered viral spread in mice. there have been no studies to date examining the interactions between the TF protein and other viral or cellular proteins. the differences observed between TC83 with the PRF mutation and TrD may be due to disruption of an interaction between E2 and the TF protein. the development of VEEV as a biological weapon in the united states and former USSR led to it being included as a select agent by the government of the united states of America. live attenuated vaccine candidates are based on the VEEV TrD infectious clone used in the current study. these include clones with insertion of specific point mutations or a mutation in the PE2 cleavage signal combined with a mutation that rescues E1 gene function. the multiple-cloning site of pJD175f was digested at the SalI and SacI restriction sites using the respective Fast-Digest restriction enzymes (Thermo Fisher) the restriction digestion products were separated via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV detection. experimental plasmid inserts containing putative frameshift signals were generated as gBlocks. genesis of the UUU UUA slippery sites to G UUC UUG (named ssM), and (iii) insertion of a UAA termination codon in the 1 frame after the viral sequences (denoted 3\u2032 1 Ter) cells were cultured in modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) control and experimental dual-luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected into cells using a Fugene HD transfection kit at a 3:1 transfection reagent-to-DNA ratio. assays of programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting were assayed as previously described (49) using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) nine picomoles of the PRF RNA templates was denatured at 65\u00b0C for 4 min and refolded at 37\u00b0C for 20 min in 5 folding buffer. cDNA products were separated through an 8% urea gel and visualized on a phosphorimager. the visual clarity of the gel images was adjusted on Adobe Photoshop Lightroom software. pTC83 and pV3000 plasmids were modified by overlapping PCR extension. the silent slippery site mutations consisted of the changes T9964G, T9967C, and A9970G to change the UUU UUA slippery sites to G UUC UUG within the pTC83 and pV3000 (TrD) plasmids. in vitro-transcribed viral RNAs were electroporated into BHK-J cells. cells were washed twice and resuspended in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (D-PBS;
