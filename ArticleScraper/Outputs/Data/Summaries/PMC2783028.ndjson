{"summary": "eight-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 101 MID50 of A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002(H5N1) viruses. PF was evaluated by observation of hydroxyproline concentrations, lung indexes, and histopathology on days 7, 14 and 30 postinoculation. human H5N1 infection is characterized by a severe influenza syndrome, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. most patients die of progressive respiratory failure that is believed to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) most patients die of progressive respiratory failure that is believed to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) laboratory animal can provide considerable insight into pathogenesis of complex process of fibrosis in the lung. previous studies showed that H5N1 virus could induce typical ARDS in mice. this virus was highly lethal to mice and could cause typical ARDS. the virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs at 37\u00b0C for 32 h. third-passage virus was gradient purified and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. animals and inoculation with virus Eight-wk-old female SPF BALB/c mice with body weight of 17-18 g were purchased from Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center. experimental protocols two types of experiments were carried out in this study. the first experiment was to investigate the mortality, clinical signs, and the presence and severity of PF in H5N1-infected mice over a 30-d time period. the animals' general behavior and clinical signs, including the food intake, were monitored daily in each group for 30 days. the upper parts of right lungs were excised and weighed before and after oven desiccation at 80\u00b0C for 8 hours to calculate indexes according to following formulas: lung wet-to-dry weight ratio = weight of the whole wet lung/weight of the whole dry lung. the dry lung-to-body weight ratio (%) = weight of the whole dry lung/body weight 100%. the severity of lung fibrosis in mice survived on day 30 p.i. was further classified into 4 grades. the severity of the pulmonary fibrosis was assessed according to the modified Ashcroft's score as described in methods. data are expressed as micrograms of hydroxyproline per gram of wet lung weight (g/g) titration Mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 101 MID50 of chicken/HB/108 viruses (50 l) Mean viral titers were calculated based on three mice per group and expressed as log10 EID50 per milliliter SD. the virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated egg eggs at 37\u00b0C for 32 h. third-passage virus was gradient purified and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. animals and inoculation with virus Eight-wk-old female SPF BALB/c mice with body weight of 17-18 g were purchased from Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center. the first experiment was to investigate the mortality, clinical signs, and the presence and severity of PF in H5N1-infected mice over a 30-d time period. the animals' general behavior and clinical signs, including the food intake, were monitored daily in each group for 30 days. mice were divided randomly into two groups with 40 mice each, as described in experiment 1. the upper parts of right lungs were excised and weighed before and after oven desiccation at 80\u00b0C for 8 hours to calculate indexes according to following formulas: lung wet-to-dry weight ratio = weight of the whole wet lung/weight of the whole dry lung; the dry lung-to-body weight ratio (%) = weight of the whole dry lung/body weight 100%. the severity of lung fibrosis in mice survived on day 30 p.i. was further classified into 4 grades. the severity of the pulmonary fibrosis was assessed according to the modified Ashcroft's score as described in methods. data are expressed as micrograms of hydroxyproline per gram of wet lung weight (g/g) titration Mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 101 MID50 of chicken/HB/108 viruses. Mean viral titers were calculated based on three mice per group and expressed as log10 EID50 per milliliter SD. 18% (4 of 22) of infected mice survived the acute stage but developed late stage disease acceleration. the H5N1 infection in mice induced an acute reduction in body weight on days 2 to 8 p.i. and caused a greater decrease in body weight gain on days 10 to 30 p.i. fibrosis was managed to be compensated by the other lung. H5N1 virus-infected lung on day 7 p.i. showed fibrosis one side and emphysema on the other side. the diffuse intra-alveolar fibrosis was a common finding. the thickened bronchiolar walls with proliferated fibroblasts lead to bronchiolar stenosis. focal alveolar collapse and alveolar ectasia were observed simultaneously. 23% (5 of 22) mice had minimal fibrosis, 32% (7 of 22) had moderate fibrosis, and 18% (4 of 22) underwent severe fibrosis. severe distortion of structure and diffuse fibrous areas were observed in lung fields. hydroxyproline contents were measured at days 7, 14 and 30 p.i. on day 7 p.i., the lung hydroxyproline levels returned to normal on day 14 p.i. and increased by almost two-fold on day 30 p.i. compared with that in control mice. uninfected control group (Open bars), and H5N1 virus-infected group (Solid bars) values are presented as means SD from 4 mice each group. peak viral titer appeared on day 6 p.i. and viruses were below the detectable level on day 14 p.i. the onset of inappetence and inactivity was correlated with loss of body weight, which continued to decline until death. at the restoration stage, the clinical signs in most survived animals resolved gradually on days 9 to 14 p.i.. however, 18% (4 of 22) of H5N1-infected mice survived the acute stage but developed late stage disease acceleration. on day 7 p.i., some infected animals developed the massive PF with \"flesh\" appearance in one lung but the severe emphysema on the other. H5N1 virus-infected lung on day 7 p.i. showed fibrosis one side and emphysema on the other. some animals displayed typical interstitial fibrosis in lungs. the diffuse intra-alveolar fibrosis was a common finding. the thickened bronchiolar walls with proliferated fibroblasts lead to bronchiolar stenosis. at the final fibrotic stage, the survived mice developed PF of different severities on day 30 p.i. at low power magnification, severe distortion of structure and diffuse fibrous areas were observed in lung fields. thin-lined alveolar septa, only a few alveolar macrophages and minimal collagen deposition. hydroxyproline content Hydroxyproline, the amino acid found almost exclusively in collagen, can reflect the collagen deposition in lungs [20] therefore, lung hydroxyproline measurement can provide a direct measurement of the formation of PF. on day 30 p.i., the survived mice showed the significantly decreased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios (a) and dry lung-to-body weight ratios (b) after H5N1 infection in mice. uninfected control group (Open bars), and H5N1 virus-infected group (Solid bars). infected mice had highly edematous lungs on day 7 p.i., which were demonstrated by the dramatically increased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios. most infected mice developed PF gradually at late stage. 18% of the survived mice underwent severe fibrosis. mice with fibrotic lung severely compromised the quality of life. fibrosis of the lung is correlated with respiratory failure and an increased risk of death. the pathogenesis of PF is not fully understood. corticosteroids may prevent the collagen overexpression and decrease the up-regulated cytokines including TGF- in bleomycin-induced PF model. ARDS will contribute to the investigation of fibrogenesis and potential therapeutic intervention in human H5N1 disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors would like to thank Dr. Zanmin Song for the invaluable help given in reviewing the manuscript."}
