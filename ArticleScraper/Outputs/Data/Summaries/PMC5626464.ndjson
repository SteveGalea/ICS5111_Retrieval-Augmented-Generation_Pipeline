{"summary": "Burkholderia pseudomallei causes the potentially fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. the bacteria impose a cytopathic effect upon host cells by fusing the infected cell with one or more neighboring cells. the induction of host cell fusions is proposed to facilitate dissemination of the virus and escape from immune defenses. a protein, VgrG-5, belongs to the group of specialized VgrG proteins that contain a variable C-terminal extension. the protein is required for MNGC formation and initiation of a lethal infection in mice. at present, work on the VgrG-5 protein did not result in the identification of the host cell target of the T6SS-5. the adherent murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 displays pronounced MNGC formation after a few hours post infection with B. thailandensis wild type. this mutant is unable to induce MNGC formation in untreated macrophages and other cells [23]. depletion of host cell surface proteins from RAW264.7 macrophages reduces T6SS-5 stimulated cell-cell fusions. FACS histograms of macrophages treated with 0.05% trypsin or 0.05% EDTA for 30 min. cells were infected with B. thailandensis for 3 h, washed and split into two groups. cells were collected, counted and seeded using agarose overlay assays. fusions in trypsin treated macrophages infected with B. thailandensis T6SS-5 at 5 and 8 h post seeding. proteolytic treatment of recipient cells resulted in significantly reduced MNGC formation. protein(s) located specifically on the surface of both donor (infected) and recipient (neighboring uninfected) RAW264.7 macrophages contribute to MNGC formation induced by B. thailandensis. we incubated macrophages with 10 mM MCD for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to sequester cholesterol from cellular membranes. this treatment resulted in a 51% decrease in total cholesterol content. data show mean values + SD of four independent experiments performed in duplicate. ***, P 0.0001 (t-test)/effect size: 1.454 (Glass\u2019s. g) Schematic illustrating MCD-based cholesterol extraction from infected donor cells. the T6SS-5 mutant is defective in induction of MNGC formation of MCD treated cells. macrophages were infected with B. thailandensis at MOI 33 for approximately 6 h and treated with 10 mM MCD for 1 h. exogenous addition of cholesterol reduces cell-cell fusions. untreated macrophages infected with B. thailandensis showed 13% MNGC formation. supplementing the medium with 4 g/ml cholesterol significantly reduced the number of cell-cell fusions. MNGC formation of macrophages infected with B. thailandensis at an MOI of 17 and treated with 4 g/ml cholesterol at the time of infection followed by a 10 h incubation period. data represent mean values + SD of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. the effect of cholesterol is specific for MNGC formation stimulated by the T6SS-5. the results suggest that a surplus of cholesterol impairs MNGC formation. acute depletion of surface proteins from host cells during infection with B. thailandensis wild type decreases MNGC formation. trypsin treatment showed 99% of trypsin treated macrophages were viable. 99% of trypsin treated macrophages were viable. two independent experiments performed in duplicate. ***, P 0.0001 (t-test)/effect size: 1.609 (Hedges\u2019 g); ns, not significant, P value = 0.468 (Mann Whitney test)/effect size: 0.229 (Mann Whitney r). cell-cell fusions in trypsin treated macrophages infected with B. thailandensis T6SS-5 at 5 and 8 h post seeding. a 49% and 24% formation efficiency was observed for EDTA and trypsin treated donor cells. uninfected macrophages infected with B. thailandensis at MOI 33 for 6 h. detached cells were mixed at equal ratios with uninfected and untreated macrophages. cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at 6105 cells per well. cells were brought into contact through agarose overlay. data represent mean + SD of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. data represent mean + SD of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. ns, not significant P = 0.0438 (t-test)/effect size: 0.323 (Hedges\u2019 g). macrophages were infected with B. thailandensis at MOI 17 for approximately 8 h. acute cholesterol depletion of infected macrophages before development of MNGCs significantly reduced number of cell-cell fusions relative to infected but untreated cells. macrophages treated with 4 g/ml cholesterol for 10 h showed no cytotoxic effect. phagocytosis and intracellular survival of B. thailandensis was not affected by addition of cholesterol. ns, not significant, P value = 0.67 (Welch\u2019s t-test)/effect size: 2.429 (Glass\u2019s ). data represent mean values + SD of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. incubation of cells with 50 ng/ml IL-4 alone or 50 ng/ml IL-4 and 4 g/ml cholesterol did not result in significantly different MNGC formation. results suggest that a surplus of cholesterol impairs MNGC formation and that optimal levels of cholesterol are required for B. pseudomallei stimulated cell-cell fusion. depletion of host cell surface proteins and cholesterol from macrophages infected with B. thailandensis decreased T6SS-5 induced host cell fusions. involvement of host cell surface proteins in MNGC formation was probed by proteolytic treatment of macrophages using trypsin. depletion of surface proteins on uninfected recipient cells caused a significant reduction in MNGC formation compared with the internal control EDTA. a potential role of one or more host surface proteins as a target of the T6SS-5 has to be elucidated in future studies. the results suggest that T6SS-5 stimulated MNGC formation is influenced by cholesterol and that a certain cholesterol level is necessary for optimal MNGC formation. the latter is in line with a previous study demonstrating that both MCD-based depletion of cholesterol and enrichment of cholesterol of host cells decreases internalization of Mycobacterium smegmatis into host cells. tssK-5 mutant harbors a non-functional T6SS-5. mutant is unable to induce MNGC formation [23]. trypsin and EDTA treated cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at a density of 6105 and 4105 cells/well. the next day the cells in the 24 well plate were infected with opsonized B. thailandensis at an MOI of 33. the untreated and uninfected macrophages in the petri dish were washed once with PBS and 0.05% trypsin or 0.05% EDTA was added. after 30 minutes of incubation at 37\u00b0C the cells were removed and counted. these cells were then spun down at 400 g for 5 min after which they were diluted to 1106 cells/ml in complete medium containing 0.1% agarose. untreated and uninfected macrophages in petri dish were counted. complete medium was added to the EDTA and trypsin treated cells. detached cells were removed and counted. cells were washed twice in PBS containing 1% FBS. data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.2 (Tree Star) two independent experiments were performed in duplicate. 3105 untreated and uninfected RAW264.7 macrophages per well were added and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min to bring them into contact with other cells. after 2\u20133 h, three random images per well were taken and MNGC formation was determined as described above. cellular cholesterol 1106 RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded into wells of a 6 well plate. the cells were treated with 10 mM MCD for 1 h or with 4 g/ml cholesterol (SyntheChol; Sigma) for 10 h. differences calculated by the t test and welch\u2019s t test were confirmed by the Mann Whitney t test except for the data shown in Fig 2D. effect size was determined using Hedges\u2019 g (normal data distribution, equal variance), Glass\u2019s (normal data distribution and unequal variance) and Mann Whitney r (non-normal distribution of data) quantification of MNGC formation MNGCs were defined as cells containing a minimum of three nuclei and quantified per field using the formula: (number of nuclei within MNGCs/total number of nuclei) 100. surface protein depletion of infected RAW 264.7 macrophages 5105 RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded into wells of a 6 well plate 24 h prior to the infection. five randomly sampled images of live cells per well were taken using a TS100 microscope. the viability of RAW264.7 macrophages was determined using trypan blue exclusion (N = >1000 cells) 5105 macrophages were seeded into a 6 well plate and 2106 cells were seeded in a petri dish and incubated overnight. the next day the cells in the 6 well plate were infected with opsonized B. thailandensis at an MOI of 33. after 1 h the media was removed, the cells were counted. Flow cytometry of trypsinized RAW264.7 macrophages were grown to 70\u201380% confluence in petri dishes, washed and treated with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin or 0.05% (w/v) EDTA for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. complete DMEM medium was added and detached cells were counted. infected donor RAW264.7 macrophages 1.5105 were seeded into a 24 well plate and infected with opsonised B. thailandensis at an MOI of 33 the next day. the cells were then washed twice with PBS and complete DMEM supplemented with 100 g/ml imipenem. ised B. thailandensis wild type or T6SS-5 mutant was added at an MOI of 17 and 4 g/ml SyntheChol (Sigma; diluted in water) the cells were incubated for 10 h after which images of live cells were taken to quantify MNGC formation. the remaining cell monolayers were solubilized in 1.5 ml/well 0.1 M NaOH. the total protein content was measured using the BCA assay. the mutant is unable to induce MNGC formation in untreated macrophages. representative images of macrophages infected with B. thailandensis wild type (wt) and T6SS-5 mutant at MOI 10 for 17 h. images were acquired at 3\u20134 h post seeding using agarose overlay assays.
