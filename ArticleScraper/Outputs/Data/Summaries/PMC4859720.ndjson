{"summary": "enteroviruses include poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus A (CVA), coxsackievirus B (CVB), echoviruses (Echo) and numbered enteroviruses (EVs) (1). EV71 is known as a common pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease. the canonical NF-B pathway is activated by the engagement of various stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, lipopeptides, and viruses with their receptors. the liberated NF-B molecule, which possesses nuclear localization signal (NLS regions), subsequently enters the nucleus and activates target gene transcription (9). e cleaves MAVS (19) and EV71-induced caspases cleave MDA-5 (20). 2C proteins are the most conserved and complex nonstructural proteins of enteroviruses. however, the biological function of the 2C proteins in innate immunity system remains unclear. 293T cells and HeLa cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate ProFection mammalian transfection system (Promega) and the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the pNTAP-A expression vector was purchased from Stratagene. the resulting constructs were designated PV-2C-Flag, CVA16-2C-Flag, and CVB3-2C-Flag. the sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing to possess 100% agreement with the original sequence. PP1-binding-deficient mutant of EV71 2C barely inhibits IKK phosphorylation and NF-B activation. 293T cells were transfected with the vector, 2C-Flag, or the Flag-tagged 3E3L mutant. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysed. initiation codons and termination codons are in blue. the site of mutagenesis is in red. anti-EV71 2C rabbit polyclonal antibody was produced by us. EV71 2C-host protein complexes were purified using washed streptavidin resin and then washed calmodulin resin. the precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the resin for 10 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. the purified host proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling the beads for 10 min. the reaction mixture was gently shaken at 4\u00b0C for 2 to 4 h. the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling them for 10 min. in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed, blocked with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (recognizing 2C-HA), rabbit anti-EV71 2C antibody (recognizing EV71-expressed 2C), and mouse anti-Flag antibody (recognizing PP1c) overnight at 4\u00b0C. 293T cells grown on six-well plates were cotransfected with the NF-B luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK, 2C-Flag, 3E3L-Flag, or the control vector plasmid. the cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 s. for all experiments, experiments were performed in triplicate. the pNTAP-A expression vector was purchased from Stratagene. pNTAP-A-2C was obtained by PCR amplification of the open reading frame (ORF) of EV71 2C and then cloned into the pNTAP-A vector. the ORFs of the PV, CVA16, and CVB3 2C proteins were amplified by PCR. the sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing to possess 100% agreement with the original sequence. the primers used in this study are summarized in Table 1. 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-IKK and the vector, 2C-Flag, or 3E3L mutant-Flag at 24 h posttransfection. the whole-cell lysate was immunoblotted by using the indicated antibodies. the data shown (mean SD fold change) are representative of those from three independent experiments. anti-PP1 (Santa Cruz); rabbit anti-phospho-IKK/ (Ser 176/180; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-phospho-IKK/ (Ser 176/180; Cell Signaling Technology); and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz). EV71 2C-host protein complexes were first purified using washed streptavidin resin and then washed calmodulin resin. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids or vectors indicated below. they were stimulated by TNF- (10 ng/ml) for 15 min or infected with EV71 (MOI = 5) for 24 h. cells were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. reaction mixture was gently shaken overnight at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. ants were subjected to the first step of co-IP using an EZview Red anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the immunoprecipitates of the first step of co-IP were eluted with the Flag peptide (Sigma) by gently shaking the reaction mixture at 4\u00b0C for 2 to 4 h. the cells were incubated with TRITC-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG and mouse anti-flag antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. after five washes (10 min each), the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) and washed thrice (5 min each) RESULTS EV71 2C interacts with three isoforms of PP1c. we performed tandem affinity purification screening and a mass spectrometry assay to identify 2C-interacting host factors using TAP-tagged 2C and control vector pNTAP-A. 293T cells were cotransfected with 2C-HA and Flag-PP1 (A), Flag-PP1 (C), Flag-PP1 (D), or 2C-Flag with HA-PP1 (B). at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed, the whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-F. 293T cells were transfected with a vector or 2C-Flag. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. the whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or control mouse IgG. the immunoblots were probed with the antibodies. EV71 2C does not change the localization of PP1c. some PP1-interacting proteins regulate the subcellular localization of PP1. EV71 2C is located in the entire cell. fluorescent images were taken under a perkinElmer UltraView VOX confocal microscope. each image is representative of the findings for the majority of cells observed in several fields. PP1c binding is crucial for EV71 2C-mediated inhibition of IKK phosphorylation and NF-B activation. three highly conserved PP1-binding motifs are located at amino acids (aa) 14 to 21 (AAKGLEWI), amino acids 25 to 32 (ISKFIDWL), and amino acids 41 to 47 (KEKVEFL) the PP1-binding motifs are located at amino acids (aa) 14 to 21 (AAKGLEWI), amino acids 25 to 32 (ISKFIDWL), respectively. wild-type 2C effectively bound the three isoforms of PP1c. the 3E3L mutant showed significantly decreased PP1c-binding activity. the 3E3L mutant demonstrated IKK-binding activity similar to that of wild-type 2C. EV71 2C, IKK, and the three isoforms of PP1c form a tripolymer. 293T cells were transfected with the vector or 2C-Flag. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min. the whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or control mouse IgG. samples that eluted from the first immunoprecipitation were used to perform the second immunoprecipitation with mouse HA antibody or control mouse IgG antibody. the HA fusion protein was eluted by the use of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. the 2C proteins of other enteroviruses also regulate the NF-B signaling pathway via inhibition of IKK phosphorylation. we found that PV, CVA16, and CVB3 2C proteins contain three PP1-binding motifs, while CVB3 2C has only one PP1-binding motif. 2C proteins of PV, CVA16, and CVB3 bind PP1 and inhibit IKK phosphorylation. EV71 2C interacts with three isoforms of PP1c or IKK in transfected 293T cells. pNTAP-A in transfected 293T cells in context of EV71 infection. 11 fragments of catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) appearing in the purifications with TAP-tagged 2C-purified PP1c. 293T cells were cotransfected with 2C-HA and Flag-PP1 (A), Flag-PP1 (C), Flag-PP1 (D), or 2C-Flag with HA-PP1 (B). at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. the whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or control mouse IgG. the EV71 2C antibody specifically recognized EV71-expressed 2C (about 37 kDa) the results indicate that 2C interacts with PP1c. 293T cells were either not infected (mock) or infected with EV71 for 24 h. EV71 2C does not influence the localization of PP1c. some PP1-interacting proteins reportedly regulate the subcellular localization of PP1 (28\u201331) PP1c binding is crucial for EV71 2C-mediated inhibition of IKK phosphorylation and NF-B activation. most PP1c-interacting proteins (more than 95%) contain the canonical PP1-binding motif (R/K)(0,1)(V/I/L)(P)(F/W)), which directly interacts with a hydrophobic pocket. Mut1 (in which L18 and W20 in motif I were mutated to E or L), Mut2 (in which V44 and F46 in motif III were mutated to E or L), and Mut3 (in which V44 and F46 in motif III were mutated to E or L) the PP1-binding activity of EV71 2C appears to be more sensitive to the motif I or II mutation. mutant 3E3L demonstrated IKK-binding activity similar to that of wild-type 2C. PP1c-binding-deficient mutant 3E3L was introduced into IKK phosphorylation and luciferase reporter assays. PP1c binding is crucial for EV71 2C-mediated inhibition of IKK phosphorylation and NF-B activation. the 125 N-terminal amino acids of 2C mediate the interaction of 2C with IKK (21) and that PP1c interacts with IKK (34). 2C likely recruits PP1c and IKK to form a complex. 293T cells were transfected with the vector or 2C-Flag. the data shown are representative of those from three independent experiments. we performed a two-step co-IP assay using HA-IKK- and 2C-Flag- or control vector-cotransfected 293T cells. the samples that eluted from the first immunoprecipitation were used for the second immunoprecipitation. the 2C proteins of PV, CVA16, and CVB3 all interacted with the three endogenous isoforms of PP1c. however, the interaction activity between CVB3 2C and PP1 was significantly decreased. the absence of motif I likely accounts for why the interaction between CVB3 2C and PP1 is significantly reduced. interaction between the 2C proteins of PV, CVA16, CVB3 and EV71 in transfected 293T cells. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysed. the whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or control mouse IgG. the mechanism by which these viruses directly target and dephosphorylate IKK has yet to be fully dissected. EV71 2C suppresses the TNF-mediated NF-B signaling pathway by directly binding IKK and inhibiting IKK phosphorylation. EV71 2C is responsible for the inhibition of IKK and NF-B activation. both the three PP1-binding motifs from aa 1 to 47 and the IKK-binding area from aa 105 to 121 within the 125 aa are critical for the inhibition of IKK phosphorylation. the host protein hCINAP negatively regulates NF-B signaling by forming an hCINAP-PP1-IKK complex (38). however, neither study fully proved the model in which PP1, IKK, and 134.5 (or hCINAP) can form a tripolymer complex. all three isoforms of PP1c (PP1, PP1, and PP1) perform a critical function in the inhibition of IKK phosphorylation mediated by EV71 2C. PP1 is not involved in the above-mentioned processes (15, 48, 49) aa 1 to 72 or 1 to 88 of PV 2C contains membrane, nucleoside triphosphate, and RNA binding motifs. this finding suggests that this region is indispensable for poliovirus. the N-terminal region (aa 5 to 43) is known to interact with reticulon 3. this interaction is required for viral replication (53) the model of the 2C-PP1-IKK antergic complex inhibition of NF-B signaling pathway described here represents a novel strategy by which enteroviruses escape innate immunity."}
