{"summary": "the burden of disease for Korean people was calculated at 29,476 DALYs per 100,000 population from 2007 to 2015. DALYs caused by low back pain were the highest, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the burden of disease showed a consistently increasing trend from 2007 to 2015. DALYs consists of the sum of the years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, which refers to the number of years lost as a person dies earlier than life expectancy. the basic unit for these summary measures is lost years of healthy life. the higher the DALYs, the wider the gap from the ideal health level. a 2002 study on the burden of disease of Korean people was the first of its kind in Korea and the most recent burden of disease study is based on data from 2012.7,8 however, because research methodology improved in the period between these two studies, they did not use the same methodology. this study aims to examine the burden of disease in 2015 by examining data from 2007\u20132015 using the same classification of diseases and the same methodology. claims filed by oriental clinics were included in calculating YLDs. disability weight (DW) is a value which shows a quantitative level of disability of a certain health condition or disease. DW serves as a bridge to connect death with disease and morbidity. DALYs for each disease were produced with the sum of YLLs and YLDs. at level 1, all diseases were classified into three categories. they were classified as communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutrition disease (CMNN), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries. to calculate incidence and prevalence per year, we used cancer registration data for cancer, hospital discharge injury data for injuries, and the national health insurance service claims data for all the other diseases. in order to prevent overestimation of incidence and prevalence when using the claims data, we applied a washout period, defined as from at least 1 year to a maximum of 5 years. YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by gender and year with the standard life expectancy for each age group. YLDs were calculated by multiplying the number of incidence cases, mean duration and DW. DALYs per 100,000 population by gender and age. we ranked 242 diseases by excluding 18 residual categories. RESULTS Burden of disease and injuries in 2015 In Korea, the total number of all-age DALYs in 2015 was 15 million.

CMNN and NCD showed higher DALYs per 100,000 population compared to men. injuries showed a higher figure for men than for women. DALYs per 100,000 population for diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases was 4,496. the DALYs per 100,000 population for diabetes mellitus was the highest at 2,841 (9.8%), followed by low back pain at 2,140 (7.4%), and ischemic heart disease at 1,481 (5.1%). among the burden of disease for men, the top three diseases made up 22.4% out of the total burden of disease for men. among the burden of disease for men, the top three diseases made up 22.3% out of the total burden of disease of women. y tract infections 600 11 Osteoarthritis 595 Cirrhosis of the liver 536 12 Periodontal disease 503 Gastroesophageal reflux disease 523 13 Trachea, bronchus and lung cancers 480 Motorized vehicle with three or more wheels 519 14 Liver cancer 450 Periodontal disease 510 15 Schizophrenia 435 Abortion 504 16 Hemorrhagic and other non-ischemic strokes 419 Asthma 4 in the 10\u201349 age group, low back pain showed the highest burden of disease, while diabetes mellitus was ranked highest in the 50\u201369 age group and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in the age group of 70 and older. in the case of women in the pregnancy and childbirth stage, the burden of specific diseases such as abortion and women infertility was high.

YLLs per 100,000 population decreased both for men and women. YLDs per 100,000 population increased by 36.7% in 2015 compared to 2007. in the case of men, the YLDs per 100,000 population increased by 37.9% compared to 2007. asthma fell by 42.6%, peptic ulcer disease decreased by 33.1%, and injuries caused by motorized vehicles with three or more wheels by 8.8%. DALYs per 100,000 population rose by 42.3% compared to 2007. low back pain increased by 88.5%, COPD by 53.7%, and ischemic heart disease by 40.8%. DISCUSSION Korea has one of the fastest aging populations in the world. it is expected that by 2026, the elderly population will make up as much as 20.8% of the total population. the rise in YLDs can also be attributable to the increase in the demand and use of medical services as insurance coverage for diseases has been improved. in 2015, the YLLs for self-harm fell by 20% compared to 2011. in 2015, the YLLs for self-harm fell by 20% compared to 2011. the burden of disease due to low back pain rose by 88.5% compared to 2007. compared to 2007, the burden of disease in 2015 had increased by 283.8%. it seems that such a huge increase was caused by the rapid aging of the population and the downward trend of the age at which patients are diagnosed. the prevalence-based approach is a method of estimating the loss of health caused by death and disability occurring after the onset of disease. the prevalence-based approach is a method of calculating the loss of health of patients in a given year. the advantage of the incidence-based approach is that it is possible to figure out how much loss of health would arise if a disease occurs. migraine was classified as a disease with low prevalence in this study. despite its limitations, the GBD study is the most reliable study to figure out the level of Korea's burden of disease compared to other countries. study failed to consider the issue of underestimation arising out of excluding the unmet demands for medical services among those who do not use medical services. however, it is assumed that the size of burden of disease arising out of the failure to consider the unmet demands for medical services is not that large because almost every person is covered by the national health insurance."}
