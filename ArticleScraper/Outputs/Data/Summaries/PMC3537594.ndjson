{"summary": "lycorine decreases the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. but the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. human chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), a common type of leukemia, is a common type of fatal hematological malignancy. CML is a common type of fatal hematological malignancy. lycorine is a novel antitumor agent. Sodium butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor, can suppress breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and activating the apoptosis pathway. two HDAC inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat) and romidepsin (Depsipeptide, FK228), were recently approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. analysis of HDAC activity shows that lycorine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. lycorine inhibits the proliferation of K562 cells through G0/G1 phase arrest, which is mediated by the regulation of G1-related proteins. cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium with indicated concentrations of lycorine for 24 and 48 h. the cell survival rate was calculated by CCK-8 method. each value represents the mean S.D. of three independent experiments. lycorine induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. lycorine regulates the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in K562 cells. the decrease in cyclin D1 expression observed in lycorine-treated cells was accompanied by a reduction in the amount of CDK4 and CDK2. by contrast, the expression patterns of cyclin E and CDK6 were not significantly altered after treatment with lycorine. tubulin was used for normalization and verification of protein loading in Western blot analysis. p21 binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, which cause pRB hypophosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S transition. lycorine induces the expression of p21 in a p53-dependent manner in K562 cells. cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium with indicated concentrations of lycorine. each value represents the mean S.D. of three independent experiments. lycorine inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs. lycorine induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. lycorine regulates the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in K562 cells. the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased significantly. tubulin was used for normalization and verification of protein loading in western blot analysis. Lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent K562 cells treated with 0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 M lycorine. results are presented as mean S.D. (n = 3, three independent experiments) lycorine inhibits the activity of HDACs but does not affect their expression in K562 cells. lycorine inhibits cell cycle progression and induces cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in K562 cells. cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK2 are activated and move the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase. inhibition of cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression is involved in lycorine-induced G0/G1 arrest in K562 cells. pRB activity is regulated negatively by a group of proteins called CDK inhibitors. lycorine can inhibit proliferation of the human CML cell line K562 through G0/G1 phase arrest. inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity is involved in the effect of lycorine on K562 cells. K562 cells treated with different concentrations of lycorine (1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 M) or without lycorine were cultivated at 1.25 104 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate (BioCoat) at a total volume of 100 L per well. 10 L of CCK-8 solution (Beyotime) was added to each well. K562 cells treated with lycorine (5.0 M) or without lycorine were cultivated at 5 105 cells/mL in each culture flask (BioCoat) after 24 h of culture, 1 106 cells were harvested and washed with PBS. the next day, the cells were washed with PBS, stained with 50 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) and dissolved in 100 mg/L RNase A (Sigma) membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. an antibody (Abcam) raised against -tubulin (1:20000), an antibody (Bioworld) raised against pRB (1:2000), an antibody (Bioss) raised against p21 an antibody (Cell Signaling) raised against p53 (1:3000), cyclin D1 (1:200), CDK4 (1:200), and CDK2 (1:500) were diluted in PBST containing 5% non-fat lycorine (Sigma) was dissolved at 0.034 M in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) as a stock solution and diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium just before use. the maximum final concentration of DMSO in medium was less than 0.02%. cell viability was determined by scanning with an ELISA reader with a 450 nm filter. proteins were extracted from K562 cells treated with different concentrations of lycorine or without lycorine for 24 h using a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit. K562 cells treated with various concentrations of lycorine (1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 M) or without lycorine were cultivated at 5 105 cells/mL in several culture flasks (BioCoat) after 24 h of culture, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, resuspended in 100 L of RIPA lysis buffer. 5% non-fat milk and membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. after washing four times with PBST for 10 min each time, the blots were developed with a chemiluninescene detection kit (ECL; Millipore)"}
