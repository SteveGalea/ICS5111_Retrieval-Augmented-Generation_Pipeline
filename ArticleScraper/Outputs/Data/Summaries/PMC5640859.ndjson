{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV), a virus of the genus Henipavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that was first isolated in 1999. some serological surveys revealed that NiV has a wide host range, including humans, pigs, dogs, cats, horses, goats, hamsters, and fruit bats. type I IFNs induce phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase 2 and Janus kinase 1. these kinases activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 via phosphorylation at the tyrosine residues (18\u201320) STAT2 is constitutively associated with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 transcription factor complex is called IFN-sti the MV-N protein of measles virus (MV-N) inhibits host IFN responses by disrupting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. the protein possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is a leucine/isoleucine-rich motif within the N-terminal region. we compared the IFN antagonism of the N protein (NiV-N, HeV-N, and MV-N) to that of the P gene products. all the N, P, V, and W proteins significantly suppressed type I and type II IFN responses. the coexpression of N and P proteins did not reduce their IFN antagonist activity. 293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids, phRL-TK (Int) and pCAGGS-MV-N, -HeV-N, -NiV-N, or -NiV-P or pCMV-myc-NiV-P. at 24 h posttransfection, reporter assays were conducted. expression levels of NiV-Nc, NiV-Nt, HeV-Nc, and -Nt in 293T cells. the experiment was conducted three times, and a representative blot is shown. it has been reported that paramyxovirus N proteins consist of two major domains. the tail domain of the NiV-N protein diffused throughout the cell. the protein can therefore potentially affect any step of the IFN signal transduction pathway (40). cos7 or HeLa cells were transfected with 0.6 g of the pCAGGS-NiV-N or -NiV-N-HA expression plasmid. the cells were stained with anti-STAT1, -pSTAT1, -STAT2 and -pSTAT2 antibodies. the images shown are all z-stack data. Imp1 does not interact with STAT1 (43, 44) it was used as a negative control which does not coprecipitate with STAT1. a myc-tagged Imp1 construct was employed as a negative control. the myc-Imp5, myc-Imp1, and NiV-P proteins were included as positive controls for immunoprecipitation. the cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 30 min. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. the arrowheads point to a NiV-N-expressing and a non-NiV-N-expressing cell. the bar graph indicates the statistical evaluation of the rKir/Gem distribution. selectively mediated by CRM1, which is also known as exportin-1 (25, 51) STAT2 constitutively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (25, 27), so when STAT2 nuclear export is blocked in the presence of the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), STAT2 gradually accumulates in the nucleus (52) as expected, after only 1 h of treatment with 20 nM LMB, STAT2 was distributed in the whole cell. 293T cells transfected with pGAS-Luc plasmid and pCAGGS-NiV-N or -mP plasmid were treated with 1,000 U/ml IFN- or IFN- for 20 min. the cells were fixed with 20 mM dimethyl suberimidate for 30 min and then lysed for 15 min. the association between STAT1 complexes and the NiV-N protein was examined using an anti-N protein-specific antibody. pSTAT1, pSTAT1, NiV-N, and GAPDH in the cell lysates were detected by SDS-PAGE. for panels F and G, the experiments were repeated three times. detect the STAT1 complex in the BN-PAGE gel. expression levels of pSTAT1, STAT1, NiV-N, and GAPDH in each cell lysate were measured by SDS-PAGE. thus, the N protein inhibited the complex formation of STAT1 without directly binding to the complex. mRNA levels of six of the seven tested ISGs were significantly downregulated in the N protein-expressing cells. expression of the PKR gene also tended to be suppressed by the N protein. this seemed to depend on the combination of the cell type used and the subtype of IFN-. 293T cells were transfected with a NiV-N expression plasmid or empty vector. a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was carried out with anti-STAT1 antibody (E-23) or control IgG (ab37415-5) the expression of both ISRE- and GAS-driven reporter genes was inhibited by henipavirus N proteins in a dose-dependent manner. we then compared the IFN antagonism of the N protein (NiV-N, HeV-N, and MV-N) to that of the P gene products (P, V, and W) 293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids, phRL-TK (Int) and pCAGGS-MV-N, -HeV-N, -NiV-N, or -NiV-P or pCMV-myc-NiV-V or -NiV-W. expression of each antagonist was detected with a specific antibody and an anti-myc. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmid for the N protein core domain (Nc) or tail domain (Nt) of NiV or HeV followed by stimulation with 1,000 U/ml IFN- or -. expression levels of NiV-Nc, NiV-Nt, HeV-Nc, and -Nt were measured by reporter assays. in Cos7 cells, the transiently expressed NiV-N protein or its core domain accumulated in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. the tail domain of the NiV-N protein diffused throughout the cell. the NiV-N protein can therefore affect any step of the IFN signal transduction pathway (40). in the NiV-N-expressing cells, nuclear accumulation of STAT1, pSTAT1, STAT2 and pSTAT2 was significantly interrupted. the cells were stained with anti-STAT1, -pSTAT1, -STAT2, and -pSTAT2 antibodies. the results were calculated by counting approximately 60 cells from at least five randomly selected fields. NiV-P was used as a control because it acted as an inhibitor of STAT1-Imp5 binding. Imp1 associates with Imp5 to facilitate its translocation through the nuclear pore complex. a myc-tagged Imp1 construct was employed as a negative control. the interaction between Imp5 and STAT1 was investigated. the interactions between Imp5 and STAT1 were investigated. expression plasmids for NiV-N and EGFP-Kir/Gem-W268G were transfected into Cos7 cells. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. the arrowheads point to a NiV-N-expressing and a non-NiV-N-expressing cell. transiently expressed Kir/Gem-W268G showed nuclear localization. its localization was not significantly affected by the expression of NiV-N. nuclear export of STAT2 is selectively mediated by CRM1. the cells were left untreated or treated with 20 nM LMB at 37\u00b0C for 1 h or 16 h. after treatment with 1,000 U/ml IFN-, the localization of STAT2 and N protein was investigated by using anti-STAT2 and anti-N protein antibodies. or untransfected 293T cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml IFN- or IFN- for 20 min. the cells were fixed with 20 mM dimethyl suberimidate for 30 min. the cells were immediately subjected to BN-PAGE. expression levels of pSTAT1, STAT1, NiV-N, and GAPDH in each cell lysate were measured by SDS-PAGE. thus, the N protein inhibited the complex formation of STAT1 without directly binding to the complex. the anti-N protein antibody did not detect the STAT1 complex in the BN-PAGE gel. the occupancy of these regions with STAT1 complexes was reduced in the N protein-expressing cells. mRNA levels of six of the seven tested ISGs were significantly downregulated. expression of the PKR gene also tended to be suppressed by the N protein. the whole-cell lysate and fractionated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE to examine if the NiV-N protein decreased the nuclear pSTAT1 level. the relative nuclear STAT1 level (pSTAT1/histone H3) was measured by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software. PKR was detected by using an anti-PKR antibody. the relative PKR level (PKR/GAPDH) was calculated. DISCUSSION In paramyxoviruses, the P gene products block host IFN responses. nuclear transport of STATs through degradation of nup153 and p62 proteins. this suppression results in the indiscriminant prevention of host protein translocation to the nucleus. henipavirus N proteins does not affect the nuclear pore complex to prevent STAT transfer. the inhibition of IFN- responses by the N protein was weaker than that induced by the P protein. however, the inhibition of IFN- responses by the N protein was weaker than that induced by the P protein. this suggests that the IFN antagonism of N protein is comparable to that of the P gene products. coexpression of the mutant P protein (mP) did not abrogate the IFN suppression by the N protein. this indicates that N-P interaction does not impair the antagonistic activity. this is consistent with the finding that IFN inhibition by the N protein was due to the suppression of STAT complex formation.
