{"summary": "infectious disease modeling plays an important role in this dialog. the biology of the transmission pathway, the focus of this review, is critical to producing appropriate predictive models. the rapidity with which smallpox would spread in a developed nation is not known. smallpox was transmitted primarily via airborne droplets nuclei. variola inoculation was used to reduce the risk of smallpox. rash was reported to be less severe and mortality rates were 10-fold lower. inhaled naturally was in sufficiently small particles to be deposited deep within the lung. inoculation via the skin or nasal mucosa tended to produce modified disease. if true, this would indicate that natural transmission did not occur via direct skin or mucosal contact. 10% of 328 contacts had positive swabs, but only 12% developed smallpox. all subjects were vaccinated at the time of examination. vaccination four or more days after exposure is usually considered too late to prevent disease. oropharyngeal excretion of virus was merely temporally correlated with excretion of virus from elsewhere in the respiratory tract. small particles may also be dislodged from the upper airways by the turbulence of sneezing, coughing, and talking, but mostly larger than 2.5 m in diameter. airborne variola is a part of the normal smallpox syndrome, especially in the more severe cases which were also the most infectious. if pneumonitis with pulmonary excretion of virus was not a feature asymptomatic household contact with positive throat cultures, then the paradox would be resolved. both Thomas and Westwood et al. (1966) measured concentrations of natural rabbit pox aerosols. he showed that 23% of naturally airborne rabbit pox particles were 2.5 m and 71% were between 2.5 and 10 m. aerosols of vaccinia demonstrated a half-life of about 6 h at 22\u00b0C. relative humidity 50% with reduced stability at higher relative humidity. other experiments demonstrated that airborne vaccinia is highly sensitive to inactivation by germicidal ultraviolet light. in 70\u201380% of animals inoculated by scratching the tracheal mucosa through a rigid bronchoscope all developed a generalized rash. one developed variolous bronchitis and pneumonia. inhalation exposures to an atomizer spray of vesicle contents infected only one of five monkeys. animal data show artificial respirable aerosols were effective means of producing poxvirus infections. inoculation of mucus membranes was less effective at producing a generalized rash than was exposure of the lower respiratory tract. in one outbreak, the authors attributed the phenomena to an allergic reaction to inhaled variola. the rarity of transmission on public transport could be evidence that airborne transmission was not important. the rarity of transmission on crowded buses and trains could be evidence that airborne transmission was not important. 85% of cases had clear-cut exposures to known cases. some well-known hospital-associated outbreaks make it clear that airborne transmission at a distance of more than a few feet did occur occasionally. the rarity of superspreaders in smallpox is not an indication that transmission by less infectious cases was necessarily by a different route. variola aerosol concentrations would have been much lower outside of the patient's room. fine particle aerosols were the most frequent and effective mode of smallpox transmission. this would explain the relatively low mortality after variolation, the rarity of transmission by fomites, and resolve the paradox of mucosal infection. smallpox cannot be classified as an obligate airborne infectious disease, such as tuberculosis. high concentrations of variola in the lung during incubation and prodromal periods in monkeys may indicate that first generation cases after an attack with a concentrated aerosol may be more infectious than expected based on historical data. the extent of transmission to a second generation in the contemporary hospital environment may be greater than expected based on historical estimates."}
