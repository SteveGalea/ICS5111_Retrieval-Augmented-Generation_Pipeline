{"summary": "a severe duck disease outbreak has emerged throughout the major duck-producing regions of eastern china. the disease has also affected geese, chickens, and sparrows. the infected ducks showed high fever, diarrhea, and other consistent signs. a virus infection may produce dramatic effects on host cell morphology, transcription and translation patterns, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, innate immune response of the host, and apoptosis pathways. information on proteome changes in the host following virus infection may be crucial to understand the host response to the virus and viral pathogenesis. label-free proteomic analysis based on nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is emerging as a powerful method to determine disease-specific targets. ally with 0.4 mL 105.0 ELD50/mL of the challenge virus was mock-infected. the other group (n = 12) was mock-infected with sterile PBS. ovarian follicles were rapidly separated and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to reduce the cysteine side chains. 20 mM iodoacetamide was added to the samples and incubated for 30 min in dark at room temperature to alkylate the cysteine side chains. the samples were then diluted six fold with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce the urea concentration to 1 M the column effluent was directed to a nanospray ion source. the peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode and information-dependent acquisition mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. the target value was determined based on predictive automatic gain control (pAGC), and the dynamic exclusion duration was 25 s. the identified peptides were subjected to intensity-based absolute quantification. the protein abundance was calculated based on the normalized spectral protein intensity (LFQ intensity) the sequence data of the selected differentially expressed proteins were retrieved in batches from UniProtKB database (Release 2015_06) the membranes were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose transfer membrane. after blocking with 5% skimmed milk in TBST, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies of anti-OASL2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-IFIT5 (OriGene, China), anti-TPP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), mouse polyclonal antibodies of anti-H real-time RT-PCR was performed using the lightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche) the mock-infected ovarian follicles were used as control (relative expression = 1) and -actin was employed as an internal reference gene. each sample was amplified in triplicate. shelducks were kept in special cages and food and water were provided regularly. the ducks were maintained in special cages and maintained in special cages. one portion of the ovarian follicles was collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and maintained at \u201380\u00b0C for subsequent use in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis. the other portion was used for RNA extraction using Axygen Total RNA extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, China) the digests were analyzed by nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) the digests were separated by nano-flow liquid chromatography using a SC200 traps 150 m 100 mm RP-C18 Thermo EASY column (Thermo, USA) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200. the resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 at m/z 200. the normalized collision energy was 30 eV. the top 10 blast hits with an E-value of less than 1e-3 for each query sequence were retrieved and loaded into Blast2GO2 (Version 2.8.0) for GO mapping and annotation. the studied proteins were also compared against KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) GENES to retrieve their KOs. mouse polyclonal antibodies of anti-HDAC2 were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. the immunoreactive protein bands were detected using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB; BOSTER, Wuhan, China) with -actin as the loading control. real-time RT-PCR The total RNA was extracted from the ovarian follicles using a each sample was amplified in triplicate. -actin was employed as an internal reference gene. each sample was amplified in triplicate. decreased food intake were observed in the infected ducks. a lack of increase in body weight, greenish diarrhea, keratitis, and tearing were noted in the infected ducks. lysates from the samples were used for gel-assisted digestion.

ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis using an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane. it is constitutively expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane in normal cells. abnormal expression of ATP synthase is found to be involved in cell dysfunction and tumorigenesis. DTMUV infection promotes changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics, causing an increase in cellular oxygen consumption and decreased efficiency in ATP synthesis. however, the functional implications of these changes have not been demonstrated and need further research. the alteration of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) UPP has recently been implicated in viral infections. VCIP135 possesses deubiquitinating activity, which is essential for p97/p47-mediated Golgi membrane fusion. further investigations are necessary to determine whether DTMUV possesses another strategy to establish infection. IFIT5 enhances NF-B activation through increased phosphorylation and activation of IB kinase. IKK catalyzes stimulus-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of IB proteins. -tubulin, apolipoprotein, transmembrane, and coiled-coil domain-containing protein were up regulated, whereas filamin-c isoform, fibrillin, myosin-10 isoform, myosin-11 isoform, and unconventional myosin-ic were down regulated in the DTMUV-infected group. myosins are a large superfamily of motor proteins that are involved in movement along actin filaments, development of myriad cells, targeted organelle transport, endocytosis, chemotaxis, cytokinesis, and signal transduction. some viral proteins can interact with the cytoskeletal transport machinery, such as actin-binding proteins, and induce rearrangements of cytoskeletal filaments. abnormal expression of ATP synthase is found to be involved in cell dysfunction and tumorigenesis. ATP citrate lyase catalyzes the generation of acetyl-CoA, a pivotal precursor of fatty acids, from the accumulated citrate in the cytoplasm. eIF4H stimulates protein biosynthesis, ATP hydrolysis, and helicase activity of eIF4A. many viruses cleave eIF4G3 to stop host protein translation. eIF4G3 is critical for initiation of protein translation. UPP, a major intracellular protein degradation pathway, has recently been implicated in viral infections. VCIP135 possesses deubiquitinating activity, which is essential for p97/p47-mediated Golgi membrane fusion. further investigations are necessary to determine whether DTMUV possesses another strategy to establish infection. IFIT5 promotes NF-B activation through increased phosphorylation and activation of IB kinase. it facilitates the interaction between TAK1 and IKK that contributes to IKK phosphorylation. the OASL screened in the present study may be associated with differential susceptibility to the clinical outcomes of Tembusu virus infection. we have performed the first analysis of proteomic changes in duck ovarian follicles during DTMUV infection in vivo. we have shown that infection of ovarian follicles induces changes in expression of 131 proteins. the Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00463 Click here for additional data file."}
