{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gains entry into host cells by fusion of the viral envelope membrane with the host cell membrane. the binding then induces conformational changes of the gp120, which allows the gp120 to interact with a cellular surface chemokine receptor. the two most common types of coreceptors for HIV-1 entry are CXCR4 and CCR5. tors of endosome acidification attenuate infections by many retroviruses, including MLV, avian leukosis virus, jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, equine infectious anemia virus, and foamy virus. the entry of these retroviruses occurs through acidic late endosomes and requires endosomal cathepsin proteases. the endosome acidification inhibitors do not suppress CD4-dependent HIV-1 infections, but rather enhance them efficiently infects CD4-positive cells than 293T cells. mNDK virus induces CD4-independent and -dependent infections. results suggest that the CD4-independent mNDK virus enters through acidic late endosomes. transduction titers of the VSV-G- and mNDK Env-bearing HIV-1 vectors in TE671 cells were about 50% and 30% of those in 293T cells. when normalized by the titer of VSV vector, susceptibility of TE671 cells to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection was about 60% of that in 293T cells. transduction titers of mNDK Env protein-pseudotyped HIV-1 vector on 293T, TE671, HeLa, and their CD4-expressing cells were measured. this experiment was repeated 3 times, and the results are shown as the means + SD. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the relative value on the control cells. geneticin-resistant 293T cells by polyethylene glycol and hybridoma cells were obtained by co-selection with puromycin and geneticin. hybridoma cells were as susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection as 293T cells. this shows that HeLa cells lack a cellular factor that is required for the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection. Cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the CD4-independent mNDK HIV-1 vector infection. transduction titers of the lacZ gene-bearing mNDK HIV-1 vector were measured on these blasticidin-resistant cell clones. the cystatin C protein is abundantly expressed in many tissues. it inhibits cystein protease activity [30]. the cystatin C mRNA was not detected in HeLa, TE671 and 293T cells. Cystatin C enhances the CD4-independent mNDK HIV-1 vector infection. transduction titers were measured on cystatin C-transduced and -untransduced HeLa, TE671, 293T, and their CD4-expressing cells. in B activity reduced cathepsin B activity in TE671 and HeLa cells. the cathepsin B activity of 293T cells was originally low. a synthetic cathepsin B inhibitor enhances susceptibility to CD4-independent vector infection. the effects of synthetic cathepsin protease inhibitors on CD4-independent vector infection were analyzed. target cells were pretreated with cathepsin inhibitors for 5 h. this experiment was repeated 3 times, and the results are shown as averages + SD. in contrast, CA-074Me treatment attenuated the CD4-independent vector infection in a dose-dependent manner in 293T cells. but when 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me at a lower concentration, cathepsin B activity was not affected and the CD4-independent infection was not enhanced. susceptibility to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection was reverse-correlated with susceptibility to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in 293T, TE671 and HeLa cells. mNDK vector-infected cells were not detected in SAOS-2 cells. mNDK vector-infected cells were not detected in SAOS-2 cells. transduction titers of mNDK and VSV-G vectors were measured on 293T cells. mNDK activity of cell lysates from 293T, HeLa, SAOS-2 and C33A cells were measured by the cathepsin B activity assay kit. 293T cells were inoculated with an MLV vector encoding cathepsin B and puromycin-resistance genes. the puromycin-resistant 293T cell pool indeed had elevated level of cathepsin B activity compared to the control 293T cells. the cathepsin B-overexpressing 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me at 25 M. 293T cells originally expressing cathepsin B at a low level were transfected by a CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid. NF- B activation by the transfection of 293T cells with the CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid was observed. the transfection did not affect the CD4-independent infection in TE671 and HeLa cells. the inhibitory effect of CD4-TLR4 on the CD4-independent infection was abrogated by treatment with the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me (10 M) these results indicate that the TLR4 signal activation induces cathepsin B expression and renders the cells resistant to CD4-independent HIV-1 infection. cathepsin B functions as an innate immune factor against CD4-independent HIV-1 infection. cathepsin B activity of the pcDNA3.1- or CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid-transfected 293T cells was measured by a cathepsin B activity assay kit. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the relative value on the pcDNA3.1-transfected cells. endosomal acidification is required for CD4-independent infection. higher concentrations of the inhibitors were required to inhibit the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection in HeLa cells than in 293T cells. the chloroquine treatment of cells reduced cathepsin B activity of cell lysates prepared from the treated cells. however, when chloroquine was added to the cell lysates, their cathepsin B activities were not reduced. 293T, TE671, and HeLa cells were treated with chloroquine at 25, 50, and 200 M. DMSO or chloroquine was added to cell lysates from untreated cells. fluorescence intensities were indicated. dynasore treatment of target cells moderately attenuated cathepsin B activity. however, when dynasore was added to cell lysates, the cathepsin B activity was not affected. inhibition of endocytosis by dynasore might suppress cathepsin B activity by reducing number of endosomes in the treated cells. psin B activities of cell lysates from DMSO- or dynasore-treated cells were measured. fluorescence intensities were indicated. effects of chloroquine, CA-074Me, and dynasore on endocytosis of Cy3-conjugated transferin were analyzed. iters of the mNDK vector were measured on 293T, TE671 and HeLa cells transfected with an expression plasmid of pUC18-transfected cells. pUC18-transfected cells were transfected with an expression plasmid of mNDK-tagged Eps15 dominant negative mutant (Eps15-DN). mNDK infection also involves participation of endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and ca endosome acidification, endocytosis, and cathepsin B activity are involved in the CD4-independent mNDK infection. transduction titers of the VSV-G- and mNDK Env-bearing HIV-1 vectors in TE671 cells were about 50% and 30% of those in 293T cells. SV and mNDK vectors in 293T cells were about 70% and 3% of those in 293T cells. but when cells were engineered to express CD4, they were found to be as susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection as 293T/CD4 and TE671/CD4 cells. transduction titers of mNDK HIV-1 vector on hybridoma cells between 293T and 293T cells were measured. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the relative value on 293T cells. hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were constructed. geneticin-resistant HeLa cells were inoculated with an mNDK HIV-1 vector containing a blasticidin-resistance gene as a selectable marker. the mNDK HIV-1 vector was diluted to obtain one blasticidin-resistant cell colony in normal HeLa cells per a 10-cm culture dish. PCR was performed using genomic DNA samples prepared from the HmN-2 cells. the PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. to obtain the cDNA fragment expressed in the HmN-2 cells, RT-PCR was performed. cystatin C was 3 times more susceptible to the mNDK vector infection than control HeLa cells transduced by the empty MLV vector. Cystatin C expression also enhanced the CD4-dependent infection, but the effect on the CD4-dependent infection was less than that on the CD4-independent infection. Cystatin C expression was confirmed by Western immunoblotting using the cystatin C antibody (lower panel) the cell surface expression of CXCR4 on the cystatin C-transduced and \u2013untransduced HeLa cells was analyzed by a fluorescence flow cytometer. close and open areas indicate cells treated with control serum and then with the secondary antibody. the closed area and green line indicate cells unstained and cells stained with the cathepsin B detection reagent. this experiment was repeated 3 times, and the results are shown as means + SD. cathepsin B inhibition by cystatin C or CA-074Me leads to enhancement of the CD4-independent vector infection. this suggests that cathepsin B plays a role in suppressing the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection in HeLa and TE671 cells. 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me at a lower concentration to see if or not the CD4-independent vector infection would be promoted. the 293T cells were then treated with CA-074Me at a lower concentration to see whether or not the CD4-independent vector infection would be promoted. but when 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me, cathepsin B activity in the treated 293T cells was not affected. CA-074Me treatment conferred SAOS-2 cells susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection. the infection resistance of SAOS-2 cells is likely to involve post-entry mechanisms either. C33A cells were as susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection. transduction titers of the mNDK vector were measured on DMSO- (Cont.) or CA-074Me-treated SAOS-2 cells. these experiments were repeated 3 times, and the results are shown as the means + SD. expression of cathepsin B results in inhibition of CD4-independent infection in 293T cells. cathepsin B is a host defense factor against the CD4-independent infection. the results suggest that cathepsin B attenuates the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. 293T cells originally expressing cathepsin B at a low level were transfected by a CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid. NF- B activation by the transfection of 293T cells with the CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid was observed. the transfection did not affect the CD4-independent infection in TE671 and HeLa cells, in which cathepsin B was expressed at a high level. transduction titers of the mNDK vector were measured on pcDNA3.1- or CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid-transfected 293T cells. titers of the mNDK vector were measured on pcDNA3.1- or CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid-transfected 293T cells. cathepsin B attenuates the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in cells with high cathepsin B activity, but does not the CD4-dependent infection. the effects of endosome acidification inhibitors, bafilomycin A-1 (BFLA-1) and chloroquine, on the CD4-independent and \u2013dependent HIV-1 vector infections were analyzed. endosome acidification inhibitor treatment of cells suppresses cathepsin B activation, but not cathepsin activity. treatment of cells did not reduce cell surface expression of CXCR4. abrogation of the CD4-independent, but not the CD4-dependent, HIV-1 infection requires endosome acidification. XCR4 was analyzed on the treated cells by a fluorescence flow cytometer (panel E) the results suggest that the CD4-independent HIV-1 particles are internalized by endocytosis for the infection. the results suggest that the CD4-independent HIV-1 particles are internalized by endocytosis for the infection. dynasore treatment inhibited endocytosis of Cy3-conjugated transferin as expected. however, the chloroquine or CA-074Me treatment did not. this result suggests that the chloroquine or CA-074Me treatment inhibits the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. expression of the Eps15-DN in the transfected cells was analyzed by a flow cytometry. the dominant negative mutant suppresses endocytosis, but not the CD4-dependent infection. the Eps15-DN suppressed the CD4-independent mNDK infection. the cell surface expression of CXCR4 was analyzed on the treated cells by a fluorescence flow cytometer. the results are shown as averages + SD. CD4-independent ROD/B vector infection also involves participation of endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and cathepsin B activities. 4 cells treated with CA-074Me (panel A), chloroquine (panel B), or dynasore (panel C) were treated with DMSO-treated cells. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control cells. cystatin C may not be the factor necessary for the CD4-independent infection in 293T cells. 293T cells could have another factor suppressing cathepsin B activity. another cystatin member, cystatin B, has been reported to be associated with higher susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages to CD4-dependent HIV-1 infection. miyauchi et al. recently reported that CD4-dependent HIV-1 enters host cells via endosomes. the CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles might be internalized by dynamin-independent endocytosis. further studies are needed to clarify this issue. microbial cystatins inhibit host immunity mediated by cathepsin proteases. the endocytic infection route of retroviruses might be changed to a cell surface infection route to escape from the host immunity mediated by endosomal cathepsin proteases. the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection occurs through acidic endosomes. expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. Y. Yokomaku through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, USA. an expression plasmid encoding the CD4-TLR4 fusion protein was constructed in our research group. the inoculated cells were selected by puromycin (Sigma) to construct cathepsin B-overexpressing cells. puromycin-resistant cell pools were used in this study. the inoculated cells were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) 2 days after inoculation. blue cells were counted to estimate the transduction titer. the undiluted HIV-1 vector containing the mNDK Env protein induced (6.0+1.6)103, (2.1+0.5)103, and (2.1+0.3)102 blue cells in DMSO gene-encoding mNDK Env-bearing HIV-1 vector was constructed by transfection of COS7 cells with the R8.91 and mNDK Env expression plasmids together with a blasticidin resistance gene-encoding HIV-1 vector genome expression plasmid (Invitrogen) the inoculated cells were selected by blasticidin (Invitrogen) reagent uses fluorophore cresyl violet that is bi-substituted by an amide linkage to a peptide that contains a cathepsin B target cleavage sequence. the mono and non-substituted cresyl violet fluorophores generates red fluorescence. the stained cells were subjected to a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to measure their fluorescence intensity.
