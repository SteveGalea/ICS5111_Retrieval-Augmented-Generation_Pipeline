{"summary": "vaccinology contributes to the prevention of infectious diseases (e.g., polio, measles, and rubella) and antiserums for toxoids (e.g., snake bites, spider bites and jellyfish stings) there is a strong demand for the development of safer and more effective vaccines toward not only the prevention of many infectious diseases. Tam developed multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) system to improve poor immunogenicity of subunit peptide vaccines. multiple copies of antigenic peptides are simultaneously bound to the - and -amino groups of a non-immunogenic Lys-based dendritic scaffold. the MAP concept represented a major breakthrough for vaccine systems. helper T-cell epitope Antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells. of them, T-cell epitopes are presented by class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of APCs and B-cells. anti-T-cell epitopes were mostly lower than those of B-cell epitopes [26,27]. lipophilic modifications A wide variety of cells including B-cells, T-cells, DCs, and macrophages express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on their surfaces. TLR-mediated stimulation of APCs significantly enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Ab production, and immune responses. lipopeptide vaccines are currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials treating HIV and hepatitis B virus [46-48] the incorporation of lipids with known immune-stimulating characteristics into the MAP system produces self-adjuvanting lipopeptide candidates that can induce Ab and cellular responses in the absence of additional adjuvants. n-terminus or C-terminus of both T-cell epitope and B-cell epitope were linked via disulfate, thioether, oxime, or peptide bond. the immunological evaluation of the same epitope-containing molecules with different linkages showed unique properties in terms of their stabilities to serum. stoichiometric epitope density of multivalent ligands is an important parameter. alternative synthetic approaches are used to attach multiple copies of antigenic peptides onto organic or inorganic scaffolds. free radical-induced polymerization of vinyl monomers is one of the most common and useful reactions for making polymers. t al. evaluated the vaccine efficacy of polymeric immunogens containing 7 B-cell epitopes (88/30, Y504S, BSA10, NS27, NS1, NS5, and PL1; the N-terminal GAS M protein sequence) the polymeric GAS vaccine molecules showed outstanding broad immunogenicity and protection from GAS infection in mice. self-assembling peptide nanoparticles exposed multiple copies of HRC1 on their surface. peptide nanoparticles are non-cytotoxic and minimally immunogenic. immunization of mice with peptide nanoparticles bearing the malaria B-cell epitope successfully induced high Ab titers and long-lasting protection. the use of a self-assembling non-peptidic dendritic polymer as an antigen-display system was recently reported. multiple copies of J14 (B-cell epitope from the GAS M-protein) were attached on dendrimers via cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. subsequent self-assembly was carried out in water to form nanoparticles (20 nm in diameter) the size-dependent toxicity of naked GNPs can be reduced by modifying their surfaces. the intracellular uptake of GNPs is mediated through endocytosis [115-117], enabling GNPs to deliver the attached molecules into the cell. helper T-cell epitope Antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells. they undergo proteolysis to form peptide epitopes. of them, T-cell epitopes are presented by class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of APCs and B-cells. lipophilic modifications A wide variety of cells including B-cells, T-cells, DCs, and macrophages express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on their surfaces.

MAP vaccines containing only B-cell epitopes induced strong immune responses. lipopeptides stimulate innate immunity by their interaction with TLRs on DCs. other lipophilic compounds such as O-acyl serine, N-acyl lysine and glycolipids are also used for this purpose. lipopeptides show no harmful side effects of adjuvants. a dual functionalized compound (CPP conjugation and DC targeting) that was designed in one study showed no synergistic enhancement of the immune response [65] a consideration for the design of multiple antigen-presenting vaccines composed of various components is their molecular geometry. the number of peptide epitopes that can be incorporated into a Lys-based dendritic scaffold is limited. stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of branching peptides such as MAPs encounters the difficulty of purification to homogeneity and characterization of the final products. free radical-induced polymerization of acryloyl-peptide building blocks yields polymeric immunogens bearing hundreds of the same or different peptide epitopes attached to the alkane backbone. acrylamide or its analog along with chain transfer agents can be controlled by the addition of acrylamide or its analog. self-assembling peptide nanoparticles are called self-assembling peptides. they are applied as topologically defined building blocks in various fields. the ability of these self-assembling peptides to form nanostructures is also of great interest. aria is currently undergoing pre-clinical trial in the us. a short fibrillizing peptide Q11 self-assembles in a salt-containing solution to form networks of nanofibers with a width of 15 nm. the resulted nanoparticles are non-cytotoxic and minimally immunogenic. nanoparticles can be easily prepared from gold salt (H[AuCl4]) in water. they can be easily prepared from gold salt (H[AuCl4]) in water. their particle sizes are controllable (ranging from 1-100 nm in diameter) acryloyl-peptide building blocks yield polymeric immunogens bearing hundreds of the same or different peptide epitopes attached to the alkane backbone. the size of the polymer construct and the distance between individual peptidic components can be controlled by the addition of acrylamide or its analog along with chain transfer agents. the polymeric GAS vaccine molecules showed outstanding broad immunogenicity and protection from GAS infection in mice. ab against each epitope presented in the polymers were successfully elicited [86] self-assembling nanoparticles as antigen-presenting platforms. self-assembly in phosphate-buffered saline yielded nanoparticles (25 nm in diameter) that exposed multiple copies of HRC1 on their surface. immunological evaluation of the nanoparticles showed specific Ab production and moderate neutralization activity of SARS coronavirus infectivity. the use of a self-assembling non-peptidic dendritic polymer as an antigen-display system was recently reported. multiple copies of J14 (B-cell epitope from the GAS M-protein) were attached on dendrimers via cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. the subsequent self-assembly was carried out in water to form nanoparticles (20 nm in diameter) native chemical ligation, click chemistry, oxime ligation, and thioether ligation. the size-dependent toxicity of naked GNPs can be reduced by modifying their surfaces. the intracellular uptake of GNPs is mediated through endocytosis. antigen-display platforms have shortcomings such as requirement of several synthetic steps and cost. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
