{"summary": "all methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Guide of Peking University. all experimental protocols were approved by Peking University. autopsies were performed within 48 hours after death. samples were fixed in 4% formalin solution after removal for 24 hours. fresh tissue samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. primary mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies were added to 2 consecutive sections to identify CFTR-positive cells and ganglion cells. they were then washed with 0.01 M PBS 3 times for 3 min each. the results of immune staining on neurofilament were compared to examine whether the CFTR-containing cells were neurons. slides were fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 min, rinsed in DEPC-treated water for 30 s, stained with DEPC-treated hematoxylin for 1 min, and rinsed in DEPC-treated water twice for 30 s each time. ganglion cell groups were identified by their morphology, and were isolated from the frozen tissue sections using the Leica Microdissection System (Leica LMD 6000 B, Leica Microsystems) the PCR products span one intron. 18S was amplified as an endogenous reference with the following primers. the final amplifying products of CFTR and 18S were 179 bp and 155 bp. the first amplification of PCR was performed for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 72 \u00b0C, and 40 cycles of 30 s at 52 \u00b0C. the second amplification round was for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 72 \u00b0C, and 40 cycles of 30 s at 54 \u00b0C. gastrointestinal ganglia performed in situ hybridization on consecutive formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 m) with a specific cRNA anti-sense probe against the CFTR gene. the tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in gradient ethanol, incubated in 1 N HCl at room temperature for 10 min to increase permeability. the slides were heated to 96 \u00b0C in sodium citrate buffer (pH the NF immunostaining results were compared with the CFTR in situ hybridization results on consecutive sections. none of the subjects was diagnosed with any disease of the nervous system or CF. duodenal adenocarcinoma 9 M/35 Colonic adenocarcinoma 10 F/71 Rectal adenocarcinoma 12 F/28 Amniotic fluid embolism 13 M/25 Epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis 14 F/74 Hypertensive heart disease 15 M/81 Dissecting aneurysm of the abdominal aorta 16 F/78 Acute pulmonary embolism Tissue Prepar antigen retrieval was performed by heating slides at 96 \u00b0C in a sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min29. slides were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS, then again in 3% hydrogen peroxide incubation for 30 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. slides were then washed with 0.01 M PBS 3 times for 3 min each. RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Cologne, Germany) to extract total RNA from the dissected ganglion cells. reverse transcription reactions were performed using random primers at 55 \u00b0C. the sequences of the CFTR primers were obtained from the GenBank. the primers were as follows: external 5\u2032-CACTGCTGGTATGCTCTCCA-3\u2032 (sense), and 5\u2032-AATGAATGGCATCGAAGAGG-3\u2032 (antisense) the final amplifying products of CFTR and 18S were 179 bp and 155 bp. PCR was performed with pairs of specific primers for nested RT-PCR. they were encoded as follows: 5\u2032-CCCTTCGGCGATGTT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CAGGAAACCAAGTCCACAG-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GCAGACGCCTGTAACAAC-3\u2032. the final amplification product of CFTR was 328 bp and encompassed two splicing events. anti-sense cRNA probes were generated with Sp6 RNA polymerase. sense probes were generated with T7 RNA polymerase. probes were labeled with a Digoxigenin RNA Labeling Mix. alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody was used to visualize reaction staining, which resulted in a purple-blue signal. all slides were counterstained with methyl green. the slides were incubated with a corresponding sense probe or with hybridizing solutions only as negative controls. in all segments of the tractus gastrointestinalis, expression and distribution of CFTR were similar. no obvious differences were observed between the different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of each case. CFTR-positive signals are localized to the cytoplasm of the neurons, some of the nuclei and nucleoli, dendrites, axons and nerve fibers. positive NP signals are observed in CFTR IHC and CFTR mRNA ISH positive cells. expression and distribution of CFTR mRNA displayed the same pattern among the various segments of the gastrointestinal tracts studied. ganglion cells were isolated without epithelial cells. NF mRNA was successfully amplified confirming that ganglionic neurons had indeed been captured by LMD. the CFTR product is 179 bp, and the 18S product is 155bp. the number, shape, size and orientation of the neurons in each ganglion varied in the different gastrointestinal segments. IHC results for CFTR in human gastrointestinal ganglia show segments of stomach (A), duodenum (B), jejunum (C), ileum (D), cecum (E), appendix (F), colon (G) and rectum (H). each photograph shows cell groups of enteric ganglia between two layers of smooth muscle of different orientations. brown positive signals developed with DAB show positive CFTR staining. positive NP signals are observed in CFTR IHC and CFTR mRNA ISH positive cells on consecutive sections, indicating that the CFTR positive cells are neurons. the brown positive signals developed with DAB show positive CFTR staining, same as the epithelium. the CFTR product of 179 bp was identified by agarose gel electrophoresis. NF mRNA was successfully amplified confirming that ganglionic neurons had indeed been captured by LMD. Smooth muscle cells were captured to exclude the expression of CFTR. CFTR was found localized to the mucosal epithelial cells of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon. in the years following the discovery of CFTR several other cell types were found to express CFTR, such as fibroblasts, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages. immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CFTR and NF and in situ hybridization with a CFTR mRNA anti-sense probe demonstrated the presence of NF-positive neurons. CFTR may play a role in the normal functioning of the nervous system. the main etiological factors of autonomic neuropathy in CF are considered to be metabolic and nutritional52. malfunction of CFTR in the ganglionic neurons also contributes to the occurrence of autonomic neuropathy in CF. some of these manifestations have a direct causal relation to the malfunction of the CFTR in epithelial cells. immaturity of the myenteric plexus appeared to be the main etiological factor in newborns with meconium ileus without CF61,62. ganglionitis, aganglionosis, and neuronal dysplasia have all been found in CF patients with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome and meconium ileus63,64,65."}
