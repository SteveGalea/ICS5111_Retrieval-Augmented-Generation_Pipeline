{"summary": "PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a small enveloped RNA virus belonging to the genus arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales (2, 3) there are two PRRSV species in the newly proposed taxonomy, PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, corresponding to the currently known genotype type 1 (European) and type 2 (North American) PRRSV, respectively. STATs are a family of transcription factors that regulate cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, immunity, inflammatory responses, and angiogenesis. each STAT member responds to a defined set of cytokines, although some of the cytokines can induce signaling via several STAT proteins (19\u201321). STAT3 is known as highly pleiotropic in mediating the expression of a variety of genes in response to both cytokines and growth factors. IL-6, a multifunctional cytokine produced by activated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells, plays important roles in triggering the acute phase response of the body to injury or inflammation. STAT3 is found to be a central regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and function (27) RESULTS OSM inhibits PRRSV replication, and PRRSV infection reduces STAT3 without affecting its transcript level. MARC-145 cells were pretreated with OSM for 24 h before inoculation. the cells were harvested at 24 h postinfection (hpi) the relative percentage of PRRSV RNA levels determined by real-time PCR are shown. significant differences from the untreated cells are denoted by asterisks (**) for P 0.01. PRRSV-infected PAM cells were harvested 16 hpi for immunoblotting. STAT3 level in the PRRSV-infected PAM cells was reduced to 0.37-fold. compared to mock-infected control, STAT1 remained steady. the cells were infected with PRRSV type 2 strains VR-2385 (VR), Ingelvac PRRS MLV, and VR-2332 (VR1) at 48 hpi, the cells were harvested for WB with antibody against STAT3, STAT1 and tubulin. the relative levels of STAT3 are shown below the images after normalization with tubulin. PRRSV reduces STAT3 protein level in a dose- and time-dependent manner. compared to the mock-infected cells at each time point, the STAT3 levels in the virus-infected cells were reduced 0.63-, 0.33-, and 0.24-fold. PRRSV infection reduced the level of STAT3 protein but had a minimal effect on its transcript level. MG132 treatment of the infected cells resulted in the restoration of STAT3 to a level similar to the mock-infected cells. PRRSV VR-2385 nsp or structural proteins to assess their effects on STAT3 levels. nsp2, nsp3, nsp9, and nsp10 are much larger than the other nsp. the structural proteins had a minimal effect on STAT3 and were not examined further. nsp5 plasmid was used to transfect HEK293 cells to confirm the effect on STAT3. the cells were transfected with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g of nsp5 plasmid. the nsp5 protein level increased, along with the incremental amount of the plasmid DNA in the transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 g of pCAGEN-HA-nsp5 plasmid and 0.5 g of pEGFP-C1-STAT1 plasmid. the relative levels of STAT1-GFP are shown below the images. nsp5 is known to induce autophagy (30, 31) nsp5 induced the elevation of STAT3 ubiquitination in the cells. results showed that nsp5 induced the elevation of STAT3 ubiquitination. nsp5 shortens STAT3 half-life from around 24 to 3.5 h. in the presence of nsp5, the STAT3 level decreased at a higher rate than that in the cells transfected with the empty vector. at 5, 10, 24, and 28 h after the cycloheximide treatment, the STAT3 levels in the cells with nsp5 expression were reduced by 59, 85, 93, and 94%, respectively. HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 g of YFP-tagged plasmids. they were harvested at 36 hpt for immunoblotting with antibodies against STAT3, YFP, and tubulin. the relative levels of STAT3 are shown below the images after normalization with tubulin. nsp5D1, YFP-nsp5D3, and YFP-nsp5D4 had STAT3 levels reduced by 8, 76, 58, and 67% respectively. nsp5 polypeptides are highly hydrophobic and may be membrane associated. nsp5 has five transmembrane domains spanning residues aa 13 to 35. nsp5 inhibits gp130/JAK/STAT3 signaling. as a transcription activator, STAT3 mediates multiple important signaling pathways related to immune responses, cell growth, and cell survival. nsp5 inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation was due to reduction of STAT3 protein level. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 g of nsp5 plasmid, 0.5 g of STAT3 reporter and 0.05 g of Renilla plasmid. at 24 hpt, the cells were treated with OSM and harvested for luciferase activity assay. a member of the IL-6 family, was found to synergistically inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus in combination with IFN- (25, 26) the cells were pretreated with OSM for 24 h before inoculation with the PRRSV strain VR-2385. the real-time PCR result showed that the OSM treatment significantly reduced PRRSV RNA replication in comparison to mock-treated control. PRRSV reduces STAT3 phosphorylation in MARC-145 cells upon OSM stimulation. the cells were infected with VR-2385 at an MOI of 1 and harvested for WB at 16 hpi. compared to mock-infected cells, STAT3 level was reduced to 0.36-fold. the harvesting of infected PAMs was done at 16 hpi since VR-2385 infection in these cells progresses faster than that in MARC-145 cells. to exclude the possibility that the STAT3 reduction is the consequence from infection of PRRSV strain VR-2385 only, we included strains from both PRRSV type 1 and type 2. at 48 hpi, the cells were harvested for WB with antibody against STAT3, STAT1 and tubulin. the relative levels of STAT3 are shown below the images after normalization with tubulin. antibodies against STAT3, STAT1 and tubulin at 48 hpi. the cells were harvested for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR at 24 hpi. asterisks are denoted by asterisks. the cells were harvested 6 h later for STAT3 examination. PRRSV RNA levels in the cells with or without MG132 treatment are similar. MG132 treatment restores STAT3 level in PRRSV-infected cells. nsp2, nsp3, nsp9, and nsp10 are much larger than the other nsp. the structural proteins had a minimal effect on STAT3. the cells were transfected with individual HA-nsp plasmids. HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g of nsp5 plasmid. the nsp5 protein level increased along with the incremental amount of the plasmid DNA in the transfection. the relative levels of STAT3 protein are shown below the images. nsp5 is known to induce autophagy (30, 31) compared to cells transfected with empty vector. nsp5 alone had no effect on the STAT1 level. PRRSV nsp5 leads to elevation of STAT3 polyubiquitination level. IP analyses with STAT3 antibody and then WB with antibodies against ubiquitin (Ub), STAT3 and HA were performed. nsp5 shortens STAT3 half-life from around 24 to 3.5 h. the expression of nsp5 induced a shortening of the STAT3 half-life from 24 h to approximately 3.5 h. the expression of nsp5 induced a shortening of the STAT3 half-life from 24 h to approximately 3.5 h. g of YFP-tagged plasmids harvested at 36 hpt for immunoblotting with antibodies against STAT3, YFP, and tubulin. cells transfected with YFP-nsp5D2 (amino acids [aa] 59 to 170), YFP-nsp5D3 (aa 1 to 122), and YFP-nsp5D4 (aa 86 to 170) had significantly lower STAT nsp5 has five transmembrane domains spanning residues aa 13 to 35, 45 to 67, 79 to 101, 121 to 143, and 150 to 169. there are two outside-oriented loops spanning residues aa 36 to 44 and aa 102 to 120. there is a highly conserved stretch of residues, aa 110 to 118, in the outside-oriented loop spanning aa 102 to 120. nsp5 inhibits gp130/JAK/STAT3 signaling. as a transcription activator, STAT3 mediates multiple important signaling pathways. we speculated that nsp5 would inhibit the STAT3 signaling as it reduced STAT3 protein level. luciferase activity from the EV+OSM control is denoted by asterisks. hek293 cells were cotransfected with incremental amount of nsp5 plasmid DNA. the cells were then treated with OSM for 24 h before harvested. STAT3 deficiency affects the generation of memory CD8+ T cells (35, 36) and memory B cells (37, 38). STAT3 is indispensable in the host immune system. PRRSV-specific T cells transiently appear 2 weeks after infection without a change in frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (9) PRRSV nsp5 was found to be responsible for the STAT3 reduction. nsp5 induces the elevation of the STAT3 polyubiquitination. nsp5 shortens its half-life from 24 h to approximately 3.5 h. nsp5 is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein and can form a membranous structure in the cytoplasm that could be the site for PRRSV replication (5). the deletion constructs nsp5D2, nsp5D3 and nsp5D4 containing the full or partial C-terminal domain led to the reduction, whereas nsp5D1 failed to do so. further work is needed to address the speculation. rabies virus interferon antagonist P protein inhibits the gp130 receptor signaling by interacting with activated STAT3 (46). PRRSV was shown to inhibit the IFN-activated JAK/STAT signaling by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (14). this sheds further light on PRRSV antagonizing the JAK/STAT signaling. the median tissue culture infectious dose of PRRSV was determined in MARC-145 cells (51). MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a proteasome inhibitor, was used to treat cells at a final concentration of 10 mM for 6 h prior to harvesting. cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to cultured cells at a final concentration of 100 g/ml to block protein translation. the nsp5 deletion mutants were cloned into pCDNA3-VenusC1 vectors (13) with the primers 32nsp5F1 and 85nsp5R7 for nsp5D1, 85nsp5F3 and 85nsp5R2 for nsp5D2, 32nsp5F1 and 85nsp1R5 for nsp5D3, and 85nsp5R2 for the primer is based on sequences of PRRSV VR-2332 (GenBank accession no.
