{"summary": "SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. a set of 91 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI) and healthy controls were profiled using a customized antibody array. plasma total protein concentration was measured by bio-Rad protein assay. each MMP9 or TIMP1 ELISA value was normalized to the total protein in the assayed plasma sample. box-whisker graphs illustrate the spread of the plasma protein abundance of MMP9 or TIMP1. MS/MS spectra were searched by SEQUEST (BioWorksTM rev.3.3.1 SP1). different fragmentation techniques were used to validate peptide sequences. different fragmentation techniques were used to validate peptide sequences."}
