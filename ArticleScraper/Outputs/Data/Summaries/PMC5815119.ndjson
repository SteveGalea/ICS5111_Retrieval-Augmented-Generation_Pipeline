{"summary": "the majority of oral antibiotics are prescribed in outpatient primary and urgent care clinics. effective antibiotic stewardship must include proper prescribing for outpatients as well as for those in a hospital or long-term care facility. both viruses and bacteria may colonize the nasopharynx (NP) and oropharynx (OP) without causing infection. advances in molecular testing and microbial antigen detection may allow detection of colonization or postinfectious shedding of respiratory pathogens without clinical significance. antistreptococcal antibody titer is more accurate than a throat culture. proving this immune response is time-consuming and may lead to false-negative results following appropriate antibiotic therapy. the MxA gene is expressed in blood mononuclear cells or locally in tissues. Neither type I IFN nor MxA elevates in healthy patients. detecting interferons in serum is difficult and unreliable, mainly due to their short half-life. systematic review of acute rhinosinusitis showed that a CRP of less than 10 mg/L provided evidence against bacterial sinusitis. a CRP greater than 20 mg/L showed evidence supporting bacterial sinusitis. bacterial infection stimulates/elevates CRP while having no impact on MxA levels. inflammatory cytokines, PCT elevates within 2\u20136 hours, peaks at 12\u201324 hours, and has a half-life of 25\u201340 hours. higher procalcitonin levels in patients with bacterial sepsis are associated with greater likelihood of severe sepsis, septic shock, and decreased survival. URIs tend to cause modest elevations in PCT. microbial antigen detection with enhanced sensitivity may allow detection of colonization or postinfectious shedding of respiratory pathogens without clinical significance. antistreptococcal carriers are at low risk to spread GABHS to close contacts. they do not require antibiotic treatment and are at minimal risk for developing rheumatic fever. in 83 patients presenting with pharyngitis, there was no significant difference in serum antistreptolysin O (ASO) levels between the GABHS and non-GABHS patients. only 5 patients showed a 2-fold increase in paired serum samples. blood MxA levels were found to be elevated in 79% of patients with viral pharyngitis. xA gene does not respond to other cytokines such as IL-1 or TNF-. in most cases of acute viral infections, type I IFN and MxA are released into the peripheral blood. detecting interferons in serum is difficult and unreliable due to short half-life. 89% of children with positive bacterial cultures showed a CRP elevated over 20 mg/L, consistent with a clinically significant bacterial infection. bacterial infection stimulates/elevates CRP while having no impact on MxA levels. a test system that uses both CRP and MxA simultaneously can potentially differentiate viral infections from bacterial disease. procalcitonin levels in patients with bacterial sepsis are associated with a greater likelihood of severe sepsis, septic shock, and decreased survival. URIs tend to cause modest elevations in PCT [42, 43]. a lower PCT threshold of 0.1 ng/mL could be used in association with growth of typical bacterial colonizers. r, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus infections are not specific to a particular type of virus. the MxA gene is expressed in blood mononuclear cells or locally in tissues. expression is upregulated exclusively by type I IFNs [25, 26]. CRP is a nonspecific, acute-phase protein that increases during an inflammatory process such as a severe infection. the normal CRP serum concentration is less than 1\u20133 mg/L. a high CRP level generally indicates bacterial rather than viral infection. PCT is the peptide precursor of calcitonin, a hormone synthesized by the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid and regulates calcium homeostasis. higher procalcitonin levels in patients with bacterial sepsis are associated with greater likelihood of severe sepsis, septic shock, and decreased survival. RESULTS Ten prospective human studies, totaling 1683 patients, were identified that evaluated MxA as a viral biomarker in children and/or adults. both systematic review articles, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled clinical trials that examined CRP and PCT as a biomarker for identifying clinically significant bacterial infections and supporting antibiotic stewardship were identified. 179 patients were included, 101 in the CRP measurement group and 78 in the control group. results suggest that CRP testing in patients with acute cough may reduce antibiotic prescribing and referral for radiography without compromising outcome. biomarker-driven algorithm can decrease antibiotic prescribing significantly and without an increase in adverse events. a prospective study of adults and children with febrile URIs evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a 15-minute, single-use disposable immunoassay that includes both CRP and MxA. the use of CRP independent of MxA would have led to overtreatment of 38% of viral infections. both CRP and PCT levels do not correlate consistently with each other, but in primary care patients with URI, each has moderate predictive value for clinical outcome. in most acute respiratory infections, including URI, antibiotic therapy based on either biomarker alone has led to reduced antibiotic prescriptions without increased morbidity. PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship reduced initial antibiotic prescription rates by 40% to 50% in patients with lower respiratory infection presenting to emergency departments [61], 70% to 80% in ambulatory patients presenting to their general physicians [63], and reduced total antibiotic exposure in community-acquired pneumonia by 40% to 50% [64]. a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study of adults and children with febrile URIs evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a 15-minute, single-use disposable immunoassay that includes both CRP and MxA. the use of CRP independent of MxA would have led to overtreatment of 38% of viral infections. a major obstacle to effective outpatient antibiotic stewardship and appropriate antibiotic prescribing is the difficulty in accurately defining the microbial cause of respiratory infections. this diagnosis is even more challenging when rapid tests identify bacterial pathogens present in the carrier state. at low levels, CRP and PCT are sensitive but not specific to bacterial infection, while at high levels, both CRP and PCT become more specific to bacterial infection. the combined interpretation of MxA with either CRP or PCT dramatically improves both sensitivity and specificity for differentiating a viral from bacterial infection. biomarker utility in the outpatient setting."}
