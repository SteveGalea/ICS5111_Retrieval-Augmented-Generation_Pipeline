{"summary": "ducklings were drunk with icariin and p-icariin after being challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1 (DHV-1) we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using the sodium trimetaphosphate\u2013sodium tripolyphosphate method. we recorded the number of dead ducklings, gross pathological changes in the liver. these outcomes were better in ducklings treated with p-icariin. the clinical effects of both components were related to antioxidant activities."}
