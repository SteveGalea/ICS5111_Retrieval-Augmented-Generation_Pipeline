EF has long been used for the management of fever, edema, and chills. EF is reported to possess anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-bacterial activities. EF is reported to have anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic effects on malignant human cancer cells. Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8-GFP) and NDV-GFP were propagated in the allantoic fluid of 10-day-old chicken embryos. cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated for 12 h. cells were infected with recombinant mouse interferon (IFN-) or DMEM with 100 g/mL WEF. the cells then were infected with PR8-GFP (MOI 1), NDV-GFP (MOI 2) and VSV-GFP (MOI 1). primer sequences for quantitative real-time RT-PCR were calculated using the Ct method and -actin (internal reference) to normalized mRNA expression levels (Choi et al., 2016). cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. after 24 h, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at RT. cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 15 min at RT. protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and -actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) the relative intensities of protein bands were measured using Image J. ionization mode, positive; spray voltage, 4.0 kV; capillary temperature, 320\u00b0C; sheath gas pressure, 40 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas pressure, 10 arbitrary units; ion scans, 100\u20131,500 m/z; resolution of MS scans, 17,500; and normalized collision energy, 10\u201370 eV. the WEF was filtered through standard sieves (150 m, Retsch, Haan, Germany) cells and viruses Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34, NBL-2), African green monkey kidney (Vero, ATCC CCL-81) and RAW264.7 (murine macrophage, ATCC TIB-71) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Lonza, Walker the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using the Glomax Explorer system. quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cell lysates using an RNeasy mini kit. qRT-PCR was performed using the primers listed in Table 1 and AccuPower\u00ae 2 Greenstar qPCR Master Mix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) CGCTCCACTATCTGCTTTC- Immunofluorescence staining RAW 264.7 cells (1 105) seeded onto four-well tissue culture slides were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 12 h. after viral infection, the virus and medium were removed and the cells were washed with PBS three times. g/mL, LPS (100 ng/mL), and IFN- (1,000 units) harvested at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. proteins in the buffer cell lysates (20 g) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. membrane was blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. ferulic acid (13), and o-coumaric acid (14) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) the analyses were performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) the separation was carried out on an Acclaim RSLC 120 C18 column (150 2.1 mm, 2.2 m, Dionex Corp.) Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad PRISM software. treatment effects were evaluated via analysis. results Effects of WEF on cytotoxicity in raw 264.7 cells. we investigated the effect of WEF on the secretion of TNF-, IL-6, and IFN-. concentrations of secreted IL-6, IFN-, and TNF- were 693.4167, 134.0662, and 629.625 pg/mL, respectively, after 24 h of WEF treatment. Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates of macrophage-type cells treated with or without WEF (1, 10, and 100 g/mL) similar results were obtained, and the experiment was performed three times independently. WEF suppresses viral replication in raw 264.7 cells. images were obtained at 24 hpi (200 magnification) titers were determined from the supernatant for VSV-GFP. NS, no significance; ***P 0.0001 vs. untreated cells. WEF treatment decreases influenza a virus M2 protein levels. the antiviral effect was verified after 24 h of viral infection as the presence or absence of GFP expression. UPLC-MS/MS analysis compared retention time and mass fragmentation of authentic standards identified the components of WEF. syringin (9), caffeic acid (10), 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (11), p-coumaric acid (12), ferulic acid (13), o-coumaric acid (14), and sweroside (15). Table 2. Identification and quantitation of phytochemicals in water extract of Eupatorium fortunei. the expression pattern of the influenza A virus gene HA was confirmed by qRT-PCR. the expression pattern of the influenza A virus gene HA was confirmed. 15 components were treated at a concentration of 0.2 g/mL. the expression of influenza A virus HA mRNA was lower than that of untreated cells after treatment with quercetin (0.81-fold), psoralen (0.314-fold), or quercitrin (0.334-fold) quercetin, psoralen, or quercitrin (0.2 g/mL) and IFN- (1,000 U/mL) 12 h before infection with PR8-GFP (MOI 1). the antiviral effect was verified after 24 h of viral infection as the presence or absence of GFP expression. the synthesis of influenza mRNA for M2, NP, PA, PB2 and NS-1 was dramatically suppressed in quercetin-treated cells than in psoralen- and quercitrin-treated cells and in untreated cells. we investigated the effect of quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin on IFN- secretion, as measured by ELISA. pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon play significant roles in inducing antiviral responses and immunoregulatory activities. we performed a screening test to identify pro-inflammatory cytokines and observed the interferon- production in traditional herbal medicines. DMEM containing 10% FBS alone, 1,000 unit/mL recombinant mouse IFN-, or 100 g/mL WEF and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. supernatant from each group was harvested at 12 and 24 h and clarified by centrifugation at 2,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. WEF treatment significantly reduced the viral titers by nearly 4.8-, and 4.2-folds against GFP-expressing VSV, and PR8, respectively, at 24 hpi. compared with untreated cells, WEF-treated cells displayed significantly less cell death following infection with all tested viruses. the antiviral effect was verified after 24 h of viral infection as the presence or absence of GFP expression. UPLC-MS/MS analysis compared retention time and mass fragmentation of authentic standards identified the components of WEF. psoralen (1), angelicin (2), rutin (3), quercitrin (4), isoquercitirin (5), quercetin (6), neochlorogenic acid (7), chlorogenic acid (8) syringin (9), caffeic acid (10), 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (11), p-coumaric acid (12), ferulic acid (13), o-coumaric acid (14), Quercitrin 0.002 5 11.80 465.10275 465.10303 C21H20O12 0.116 303.04980, 145.04956 Isoquercitrin 0.009 6 15.85 303.04993 303.04987 C15H10O7 0.212 285.03949, 155.04890, 153.01811, 109.02841 Quercetin 0.008 PHENOLICS 7 6.72 35 antiviral activity of the 15 identified WEF components We first tested the antiviral activity of 15 components from WEF. expression pattern of the influenza A virus gene HA was confirmed by qRT-PCR. expression of M2 protein in RAW 264.7 cells was suppressed in cells treated with quercetin than in those treated with psoralen or untreated cells. the antiviral effect was verified after 24 h of viral infection. atants from each group were harvested at 24 h, clarified, and dispensed into murine IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6 capture antibody-coated ELISA plates to measure cytokine secretion. we further investigated whether quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin treatment inhibits viral mRNA (M2, NP, PA, PB2 and NS-1) synthesis. itrin showed significantly inhibited viral replication and induced cytokine secretion, such as IFN-beta. occurrence of viral infection mainly occurs in a state of deteriorated immune function. new infectious diseases, such as avian influenza virus, have emerged. WEF treatment induces high levels of IL-6, IFN-, and TNF- secretion. we also observed that WEF treatment induces increased phosphorylation of IRF3, STAT1 and TBK1 relative to untreated cells after 12 h. the genus Eupatorium (family Asteraceae) is known to include 1,200 species in the world. it is known to have many biological activities including anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antiplasmodial, antioxidative, and immunomodulating properties. euparin from E. buniifolium exhibits antiviral activities against poliovirus type 1 (Visintini Jaime et al., 2013) and pseudorabies virus strain RC/79 (Zanon et al., 1999) essential oils of E. patens inactivates HSV-1 and VSV. WEF or its components, including quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin, can be useful as therapeutic or preventive agents to limit viral replication. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
