{"summary": "RNAi can be induced by double-stranded RNA that is processed into 21\u201325 bp siRNAs (3\u20135) cellular miRNAs are the natural inducers of RNAi. most miRNAs are synthesized as part of longer primary RNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) RNAi has been employed to inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses including HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), dengue virus, poliovirus, influenza virus A, coronavirus, herpesvirus and picornavirus (24,25). a single inhibitor has been reported with single shRNA and miRNA expression constructs (17,26\u201328) miRNA-like transcripts were shown to be more effective antivirals than regular shRNAs (17,45) using an RNA polymerase II promoter will allow lower and regulated expression, thereby reducing the risk of toxicity due to oversaturation of the RNAi machinery (46). pri-miRNA was amplified with a forward primer containing HIV-1 sequences and a reverse primer encoding BglII and XhoI sites. two complementary oligonucleotides, creating the stem-loop structure of the antiviral miRNA, were annealed as described previously (step 3) (32). ye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit obtained constructs expressing different combinations of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 pri-miRNAs. the RNA structures formed by the transcripts were predicted with the Mfold program (47). the full-length HIV-1 molecular clone LAI (accession number AF33819.3) (48) was used to produce wild-type virus. cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.2 105 cells per well. one nanogram of pRL plasmid (Promega) expressing renilla luciferase (RL) was added as an internal control for cell viability and transfection efficiency. 105 293T cells were transfected with 39\u20135000 ng of the shRNA construct and 2500 or 5000 ng of the miRNA-expression construct. total cellular RNA was extracted 2 days post-transfection with the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. gonucleotides in 10 ml ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. the membranes were washed twice for 5 min at 42\u00b0C in 2 SSC/0.1% SDS and twice for 15 min at 42\u00b0C in 0.1 SSC/0.1% SDS. signals were detected and quantified using a phosphorimager. pLV vectors expressing a miRNA (2.4 g) were co-transfected with packaging plasmids pSYNGP (1.5 g) (51), RSV-rev (0.6 g) and pVSVg (0.8 g) (52) on the third and fourth day, medium containing lentiviral vector was harvested and pooled. cellular debris was removed by filtration through a FP30/0.45 CA-S filter. the TOPO2.1/mir-17-19b construct was used as a template to generate the antiviral miRNA constructs. the construction consists of a four-step fusion PCR as shown in the Supplementary Figure 1. the pri-miRNA was amplified with a forward primer encoding a BamHI site and a reverse primer encoding the HIV-1 sequence at its 3\u2032-end (step 1). miRNA PCR products were excised from gel, purified with the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR. all miRNA constructs were sequenced with primers GFPseqF and mirR using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown as a monolayer in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hybond), minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were trypsinized one day before transfection, resuspended in DMEM without 200.000 SupT1 cells were infected with equal amounts virus (0.5 ng CA-p24) produced in 293T cells. cells were transfected with 39\u20135000 ng of the shRNA construct and 2500 or 5000 ng of the miRNA-expression construct using lipofectamine 2000 reagent. ucleotide probes were 5\u2032-end labeled with the kinaseMax kit (Ambion) to remove unincorporated nucleotides, the probes were purified on Sephadex G-25 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the sequences of all miRNA constructs were verified using the primers CMVf and V5r. the miRNA inhibitory potential was determined by co-transfection with appropriate luciferase reporters. pLV vectors expressing a miRNA (2.4 g) were co-transfected with packaging plasmids pSYNGP (1.5 g) (51), RSV-rev (0.6 g) and pVSVg (0.8 g) (5 the human mir-17-92 cluster encodes a 1 kb pri-miRNA polycistronic transcript with six pre-miRNAs that produces seven mature miRNAs. the pre-miR-17 hairpin encodes two miRNAs, one on the 5\u2032 side of the hairpin (miR-17-5p) and one on the 3\u2032 side (miR-17-3p) miRNAs are indicated in red; pA, pA, SV40 polyadenylation signal. guide strands of the siRNA against HIV-1 are blue. number of pre-miRNAs represent the length of the flanks (in nucleotides) the 19-nt r/t5 siRNA was positioned at the 5\u2032 (Er/t5-19\u2032) or 3\u2032-end (Er/t5-19\u2032) of the wild-type miRNA. we modified the passenger strand to mimic structural features (mismatches, bulges and thermodynamic stability) of the natural pre-miRNA. pre-miRNA sequences are black; mature miRNA sequences are red; guide strand is bold; no; +, 10\u201330%; +++, 30\u201370%; +++, 70\u2013100%; nd, not determined. a plasmid encoding renilla luciferase (pRL) was included to correct for transfection variation. the original shRNAs shr/t5 and shldr9 were used as positive controls. normalized firefly luciferase expression in the presence of pBS was set at 100%. renilla luciferase expression was measured 2 days post-transfection. we selected the 19-nt inhibitors for the construction of antiviral miRNA polycistrons. the original shRNA inhibitor shr/t5 seems slightly more active than the optimized Dr/t5 miRNA molecule. we titrated 39\u20132500 ng shr/t5 construct in 293T cells. the original Dwt hairpin was used as a negative control. expression of the antiviral 19-nt siRNA by construct Dr/t5 is about 15\u201330-fold lower than the expression by construct shr/t5. the intrinsic inhibitory capacity of Dr/t5 is in fact much greater than that of shr/t5. firefly luciferase expression was normalized to the renilla luciferase expression from the co-transfected pRL plasmid. the knockdown efficiency of the single Apol47 hairpin was 40%, but chaining it with the Bwt hairpin or the Awt-Ewt cluster enhanced the silencing activity. a similar pattern was observed for inhibition of HIV-1 production by antiviral polycistronic miRNAs. 293T cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter. 10 ng miRNA construct and 1 ng pRL were used as negative controls. original shRNA constructs shpol47, shpol1, shgag5, shr/t5 and shldr9 were used as positive controls. hairpin Bpol1 does not exhibit any inhibitory activity, either alone or when combined with another hairpin as in AB. we will not use hairpin Bpol1 in the final polycistron construct. antiviral siRNAs made by different polycistron constructs are similar to the activity data in Figure 5. the results are remarkably similar to the activity data in Figure 5. 2, 3 and 4 antiviral miRNA constructs and siRNAs were detected in total cellular RNA using 19-nt complementary LNA oligonucleotide probes. the original shRNA constructs were used as positive controls, showing the mature siRNAs. pBS or miRNA constructs targeting another gene were used as negative controls. 0 N 2.8 3 1.5 4.5 Apol47 6 6 6 4.8 ACDE 2.4 3 1.5 2.9 The stably transduced SupT1 cells were selected by FACS sorting and infected with HIV-1 (0.5 ng of CA-p24) virus replication was followed for 7 days by measuring the CA-p24 level in the culture supernatant. the pre-miR-17 hairpin encodes two miRNAs, one on the 5\u2032 side of the hairpin (miR-17-5p) and one on the 3\u2032 side (miR-17-3p) we subcloned each individual pre-miRNA with at least 40-nt flanks on each side of the hairpin and replaced the mature miRNA sequences with antiviral sequences. a series of antiviral miRNAs were constructed with the effective r/t5 and ldr9 siRNAs in the Dwt backbone. the 19-nt antiviral siRNAs were positioned either at the 5\u2032 (Dr/t5-19\u2032 and Dldr9-19\u2032) or 3\u2032-end (Dr/t5-19\u2032 and Dldr9-19\u2032) of the original miRNA. constructs in which the 19-nt r/t5 siRNA was positioned at the 5\u2032 (Er/t5-19\u2032) or 3\u2032-end (Er/t5-19\u2032) of the wild-type miRNA. the r/t5 siRNA was similarly incorporated into the Ewt pre-miRNA, which produces the guide strand from the 5\u2032-side of the hairpin. luciferase reporters were co-transfected in 293T cells with 20 ng antiviral miRNA construct and 1 ng pRL. the original shRNAs shr/t5 and shldr9 were used as positive controls and non-matching miRNAs. firefly and renilla luciferase expression was measured 2 days post-transfection. normalized CA-p24 expression in the presence of pBS was set at 100%. error bars represent the standard deviation in four independent experiments. the ldr9 inhibitor was introduced in the E hairpin. the observed inhibition is sequence-specific because non-matching miRNAs did not have any effect. the expression of the control renilla reporter was stable in all experiments. the intrinsic inhibitory capacity of Dr/t5 is in fact much greater than that of shr/t5. we titrated 39\u20132500 ng shr/t5 construct in 293T cells. expression of a miRNA inhibitor as part of a miRNA polycistronic transcript enhances the silencing activity. 293T cells were co-transfected with 150 ng pLAI, 1 ng pRL and 5 ng of the hairpin constructs. 293T cells were co-transfected with 150 ng pLAI, 1 ng pRL and 5 ng 1, 2, 3 or 4 miRNA constructs. two days post-transfection, CA-p24 levels in the culture supernatant and renilla luciferase expression were measured. hairpin Bpol1 does not benefit from linkage to other hairpins. this is likely due to the high inhibitory activity of the individual Dr/t5 inhibitor. luciferase results showed a moderate HIV-1 inhibition by the single miRNA constructs. we performed a Northern blot analysis with the corresponding probe. but failed to detect any passenger siRNAs. in contrast, properly processed siRNAs are produced from hairpin Apol47 in construct AB. pBS or miRNA constructs targeting another gene were used as negative controls. the original shRNA constructs were used as positive controls. pBS or miRNA constructs targeting another gene were used as positive controls. virus replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects were observed in cells expressing miRNAs N, Bpol1, Cgag5 and untransduced SupT1 cells. virus replication was profoundly inhibited in SupT1 cells expressing the polycistronic miRNA construct ACDE and control cells that express an extended triple shRNA construct (e-shRNA 3) a mature miRNA is typically 22\u201324 nt, whereas an siRNA is only 19-nt in length. despite the optimization of the miRNA-like inhibitors, their activity is less than that of the original shRNA antivirals that were used to design the miRNAs. multimerization of different miRNA hairpins is of particular interest for targeting of RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV because of their extreme genetic diversity. a major concern of the miRNA approach is the off-target effect on cellular transcripts with partial sequence complementarity. inhibition of firefly luciferase reporters clearly showed sequence-specificity as non-matching miRNAs did not have any effect. a study in which artificial miRNAs were expressed conferred viral resistance without cellular alterations. recently evidence emerged that siRNA sequences inserted in a miRNA backbone do not compete for transport and incorporation into RISC. an interesting candidate is the WAS promoter that is active in human hematopoietic precursor cells (CD34+) another intriguing possibility is to use the HIV-1 LTR promoter to express the miRNA polycistron. this approach has previously been employed for shRNA expression (65)."}
