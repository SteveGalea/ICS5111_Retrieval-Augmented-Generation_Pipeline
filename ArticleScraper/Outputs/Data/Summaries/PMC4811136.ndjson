{"summary": "cell-cell communication is an essential component in mammalian development and preservation of homeostasis. intercellular communication occurs through cellular release of extracellular vesicles. EVs may carry a number of bioactive molecules, surface receptors, and genetic information (e.g., protein-coding mRNAs and regulatory microRNAs [miRNAs]) (1\u20134) EVs interact with recipient cells through a process entailing ligand/receptor signaling at the recipient cell surface and/or the fusion of vesicle and cell plasma membranes. EV cargoes can enter the recipient cell cytoplasm or nucleus, thereby contributing additional signaling molecules and pathways. a distinguished group of leading experts in the EV field review exciting advances that uncover how EV signaling can profoundly modulate infections. esion proteins along with subunits of glutamate receptors bind to secondary neurons and modulate synaptic signaling. in this series, Zappulli and colleagues review the role of EVs in determining early neuronal development, synaptic strength, neuronal communication, and nerve regeneration. authors also discuss the evidence for a contribution of EVs to glioblastoma and in neurodegenerative diseases. Robbins et al. review EV regulation of chronic inflammatory and immune processes as part of this series. possible future applications include using EVs derived from antigen-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as vaccines (29) or modifying EV-shedding cells \u2014 and therefore derived EVs \u2014 to express immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory cytokines. EVs in cancer Tumorigenesis was formerly considered to be a largely cell-autonomous process, but is now known to be heavily influenced by communication of cancer cells with their surroundings. EVs are one of the many methods by which cancer cells communicate with themselves, other cell types (e.g., immune cells) and the surrounding supportive structures constituting the tumor microenvironment (TME) osomes (Tex) likely dictates this evasion of immunosurveillance. however, Tex also carry tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and costimulatory molecules that allow stimulation of potentially protective anticancer immune responses. whiteside describes how the biology of Tex and their cargoes can facilitate propagation of tumor-mediated immune suppression and/or immune stimulation. proteoglycan glypican-1 is enriched on cancer cell-derived exosomes. it can distinguish patients with benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancers. the detection of exosome-anchored glypican-1 was more reliable than existing assays for pancreatic tumor biomarkers. Xu et al. describe the different EV subtypes and practical considerations regarding their isolation for therapeutic purposes. the authors also discuss the importance of working with highly purified EV populations and methods to ensure purification. proteoglycan glypican-1 is enriched on cancer cell-derived exosomes. it can distinguish patients with benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancers. the detection of exosome-anchored glypican-1 was more reliable than existing assays for pancreatic tumor biomarkers.
