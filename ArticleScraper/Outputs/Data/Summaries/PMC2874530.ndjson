{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006 in a representative sample of 600 subjects living in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region (south-east France). results Respondents were most knowledgeable about AIDS, followed by avian influenza. 39% expressed anxiety about this disease. the population's knowledge level about the disease plays an important role in response to an epidemic crisis. the media also play a role in influencing public perceptions of epidemics or pandemics. only two studies have investigated the perception of disease-related risk in the general population. questionnaire included demographic questions about age, gender, education level, marital and employment status. first part of questionnaire included demographic questions about age, gender, education level, marital and employment status. subjects who had previously indicated self-reported knowledge of avian influenza were invited to answer questions about the disease's transmission routes, their behaviours at the time the disease had occurred in France. AIDS was the most well-known infectious disease since 93% of respondents confirmed they had adequate knowledge of it. the percentage of subjects with adequate knowledge of avian influenza was even higher among those who worked with animals (78%), had children (79%) and lived in the Ain district (88%) meningitis came in third (68%), followed by viral hepatitis (56%) and nosocomial infections (48%). 63% expressed concern about nosocomial infections, 61% about AIDS, 59% about meningitis and 46% about viral hepatitis. over 60% of women reported feeling anxious about all the infectious diseases mentioned, compared to 35% of men on average. higher level of anxiety for nosocomial infections was associated with lower socio-economic status. cancers were reported as the most important threat for the study population (74%) followed by diseases related to atmospheric pollution (62%), unemployment (50%) and terrorism (46%). Epidemics were perceived as a real risk by 27% of respondents. contact with contaminated poultry was the main transmission route cited. most respondents did not consider poultry or egg consumption a route of transmission. behavioural changes were more significant among women. 76% of respondents expressed solidarity with the professions involved, such as poultry stockbreeders. 80% said they would buy existing drugs. individual behaviours Yes (%) No (%) Don't know (%) Follow advice given by the family physician 96 4 0 Follow advice given by public health authorities 92* 6 2 Buy existing medications 80 14 6 Avoid public places (restaurants, stadiums, theatres) 47 48 5 Stay home 30* 64 6 Avoid hospitals 44 49 7 Leave France 12* 85 3 Follow prevention measures Yes (%) No (%) Don't know (%) Accept to be quarantined 96 3 1 Wear a mask in public areas 91* large national studies are warranted to gain a broader understanding of the knowledge and anxiety pertaining to epidemic risk in the French population. the study was carried out four months after the avian influenza epizootic occurred in France. about one quarter of the study population was concerned by epidemics. the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus was isolated in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. the epizootic lasted two months and may explain why subjects living in this area were well informed about the disease. the study population may be related to the absence of cases in France. a civic-minded attitude emerged from answers under the scenario of the occurrence of a highly infectious disease. the population would follow advice given by public authorities and agree to be quarantined, to wash their hands several times a day and wear a face mask. compliance with advice could also reflect anxiety and psychological distress. study could be the basis for more elaborated and comprehensive studies on risk perception in the french population. the recent H1N1 flu pandemic alert is a real time situation in which the public's risk perception could be explored. prepub Acknowledgements We thank the general council of the Rhone-Alps region for funding the study."}
