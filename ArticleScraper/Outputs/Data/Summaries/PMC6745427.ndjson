{"summary": "total of 2926 confirmed cases of dengue fever were documented in 2016 in Saudi Arabia alone. most cases are related to predominant dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4), climate change/extreme weather and urbanization drivers facilitate the proliferation of the incriminated disease vector (Aedes mosquito species) elucidating dengue and other emerging arboviral asymptomatic carriers is crucial for timely prevention and case management strategies in Saudi citizens, Muslim pilgrims, and expatriate workers. a regional 'One Health' policy should comprise of innovative and sustainable vector prevention, environmental management, IVM. social media and traditional media options can be used to accelerate community awareness and health education outreach. social media and traditional media options can be used to accelerate community awareness and health education outreach, and acceptance and participation with biocontrol reductionist methods. gue - placed in large water-storage reservoirs/tanks and rain fall streams were deployed successfully in Aedes vector control in china, brazil, singapore, and parts of america. genetically engineered mosquitoes, sugar toxic baits, and biologically new larvicide or adulticide agents' complements are crucial tools in improving biocontrol approaches and strategies. this is vital to establish robust evidence-based and sustainable early warning indices, policy planning and prediction, response approaches, and action plans. promoting community participation and education programs remain key prevention and elimination tactics especially during annual Hajj and seasonal Umrah pilgrimage. strengthening laboratory and epidemiological surveillance is needed to elucidate vector exposure versus immune profile diversity and phylogeography. the approach relies on generating comprehensive data to formulate reliable, effective, and sustainable decision-making policies. this includes updates to travel information to protect pilgrims of Hajj and Umrah. leveraging on the community-based 'One Health' approach is paramount in elucidating the relationship between animal-human and environment interactions. social media and traditional media options can be used to accelerate community awareness and health education outreach, and acceptance and participation with biocontrol reductionist methods. biological control measures include scaling-up community-based programs for awareness and empowerment as an effective eco-friendly weapon against disease vectors. genetically modified mosquitoes artificially infected with Wolbachia - a bacterium that stops dengue - placed in large water-storage reservoirs/tanks and rain fall streams were deployed successfully. sero-surveillance and response approaches implementation among asymptomatic populations at risk is crucial in documenting and generating data on arboviral diseases prevalence and potential risk factors. this is vital to establish robust evidence-based and sustainable early warning indices, policy planning and prediction, response approaches, and action plans. it is imperative to enhance quality data and data sharing for evidence community-based risk reduction tactics and management. concerted efforts in adapting the Sendai Framework Disaster Risk Reduction of United Nations are essential in reducing public health hazards. strengthening laboratory and epidemiological surveillance as well as insecticide resistance and monitoring Aedes mosquito behavior changes is needed to elucidate vector exposure versus immune profile diversity and phylogeography. commitment and investment in collaborative and participative research in regional biosecurity includes ample funding of research and development. safe and effective dengue and Zika drugs and vaccines discovery for pilgrims/traveler immunization programs should remain a priority in curbing the global health security and other emerging pandemics."}
