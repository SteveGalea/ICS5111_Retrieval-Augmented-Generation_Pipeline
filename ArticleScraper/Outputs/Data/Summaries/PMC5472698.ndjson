{"summary": "complement system is a constituent of the innate immunity that serves as a vital link between the innate and the adaptive immunity. the elimination of viruses by the complement system is owing to direct neutralization of cell-free viruses (Bernet et al., 2003), lysis of the virus-infected cells (Cooper and Nemerow, 1983), induction of antiviral state (Tam et al., 2014), and boosting of virus-specific immune responses due to recognition of effect the complement system is activated by the recognition of pathogens (or non-self) by the pattern recognition molecules of this system. the system is also evolved to recognize pathogens without the help of pattern recognition molecules. the first two pathways are activated with the help of pattern recognition molecules. spontaneous hydrolysis of native C3 by H2O (tick-over process) results in the formation of C3b-like C3 [C3(H2O)] (6). the initial AP C3 convertase then cleaves C3 into C3b and C3a (8). the surface-bound AP C3 convertase initiates the AP amplification loop (10) resulting in deposition of millions of C3b molecules onto the pathogen surface. sarcoma-associated herpesvirus inhibitor of complement activation (KAPOSICA); -HV68 RCA, HVS CCPH; non-structural protein 1 of Flaviviruses (NS1); non-structural protein 3/4A of Hepacivirus (NS3/4A); glycoprotein C of HSV-1 (gC-1) and -2 (gC-2), human astrovirus coat protein (CoPt) and M1 protein of INFLV (M1) the CP-mediated neutralization requires the presence of antibodies. most examples studied show that the CP-mediated neutralization requires the presence of antibody. HTLV-1 (Ezekowitz et al., 1989; Saifuddin et al., 2000) togaviridae Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Brooke et al., 2012) Sindbis virus (Hirsch et al., 1980b) Picornaviridae \u2013 Coxsackievirus B3 (Anderson et al., 2007) orthomyxoviridae INFLV A the LP is initiated by the recognition of carbohydrate patterns on the pathogen surface by MBL, collectin K-1 (CL-K1) and ficolins (L, H, and M) has also been shown to neutralize viruses. the AP, which is activated spontaneously, is capable of neutralizing viruses directly as well as due to its activation by the CP and LP. cubation of avian infectious bronchitis virus with antibody and complement produced holes of 100 diameter in the virus membrane. virolysis is not the only mechanism by which complement neutralizes viruses. the requirement of early complement components for neutralization vary from virus to virus. non-enveloped viruses coated with C3b are capable of triggering antiviral signaling as well as targeting of these virions for rapid proteasomal degradation. the other two modes of neutralization are aggregation and phagocytosis. an aggregation-mediated neutralization of viruses was observed in polyoma virus. Viruses of the families Poxviridae, Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae recruit membrane-bound regulators like CD55, CD46, and CD59. complement regulators viz. DAF (CD55) and MCP (CD46) have also been shown to be used for cellular entry by viruses. some virus families encode unique complement regulatory proteins for evading the complement system. they include down-regulation of complement activation proteins [F(a)] and up-regulation of complement regulatory proteins [F(b)] viruses have also been shown to encode their own complement regulators for protection from the host complement. the first virally encoded complement regulator identified was gC of HSV-1 (Friedman et al., 1984; Fries et al., 1986) a homolog of human RCA gene family proteins was spearheaded by the observation that an attenuated strain of VACV (designated as 6/2) does not encode this protein. complement evasion in poxviruses was first identified in VACV. one of the two major secretory proteins of VACV is a structural homolog of the RCA proteins (Kotwal and Moss, 1988) AP C3 convertases (termed decay-accelerating activity) later, it was also shown to support the inactivation of C3b and C4b with the help of factor I (termed cofactor activity) the importance of this protein was further enhanced by Isaacs et al. (1992) study. in vitro studies showed that it possesses cofactor activity for C3b and C4b, but lacks decay-accelerating activity. in vivo, investigations were performed to determine whether the low virulence of west African strains was due to the absence of MOPICE. the resistance to complement in EEV is due to the incorporation of the host complement regulators CD46, CD55, and CD59 into the outer envelope of EEV. the relative role of each of these regulators in protection against complement nonetheless is not yet clear. interaction of gC-1 with C3b blocks its interaction with properdin and C5 resulting in inhibition of complement activation. the importance of gC-1 domains that interact with C3b and that blocks properdin/C5 interaction with C3b has also been examined in vivo. a trivalent subunit antigen vaccine for genital herpes contains gC-2 and gE-2 apart from gD-2 that is essential for viral entry. betaherpesviruses Viruses have been shown to protect themselves from host complement by acquiring complement regulators from the host cells as well as by up-regulating the expression of complement regulators on the infected cells. pesvirus-6 is a collective term used for two ubiquitous human betaherpesviruses. only a restricted number of non-human primate species show susceptibility to HHV-6. efforts were directed at identifying a receptor that is ubiquitous. HVS ORF4 encodes a four CCP domain containing the RCA homolog. it is expressed as a soluble (named sCCPH) as well as membrane-anchored (named mCCPH) protein. it also has the ability to accelerate decay of the CP/LP C3 convertase. the full-length Kaposica is composed of four CCP domains, a dicysteine motif, a serine/threonine (S/T) rich region and a transmembrane domain. its spliced variants either lack the S/T region or the dicysteine motif and the S/T region. virus 68 encodes a four CCP domain homolog of RCA that exist in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. the -HV68 RCA-null virus was shown to inhibit C3b deposition on the complement activating particle zymosan. the protein was also examined for its role during the infection which suggested that it is vital for in vivo pathogenesis. gp350/220 mutant lacking N-terminal amino acids was shown to have negligible ligand activity. gp350/220 mutant lacking N-terminal amino acids was shown to have negligible ligand activity. expression of CD46 on non-permissive cells renders them susceptible to viral attachment and infection. a study in particular with AdV-37 used the C2 isoform of CD46 as a cellular receptor. one of the NS proteins, NS1, has been shown to function as a complement regulator. non-structural protein 1 is a 48 kDa glycoprotein of the flaviviruses. it is synthesized as a soluble monomer that dimerizes upon post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum. after its secretion from the infected cells, it forms large oligomers, e.g., hexamers. NS1 competitively binds to MBL which prevents the later from recognizing and neutralizing DENV. hepaciviruses Hepaciviruses contain single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 9.6 kb. it codes for 10 proteins: the structural core, NS1, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B. the virus effectively inhibits the expression of C2 (Kim et al., 2014), C4 (Banerjee et al., 2011), C3 (Mazumdar et al., 2012) and C9 (Kim et al., 2013) the core protein was also shown to reduce the secretion of IL-12 by monocytes/macrophages. HIV-1, which falls under the genus Lentivirus of Orthoretrovirinae subfamily, has been well-studied for its interaction with complement. a significant number of free virions can be found in the plasma of infected person suggesting these virions must be resistant to complement-mediated virolysis. human immunodeficiency virus is well-known to employ complement for its benefit. the first observation was made by Robinson et al. (1988, 1989) who demonstrated using patient serum that liaison between antibody and complement results in enhanced HIV infection. in vitro experiments have shown the CD21 dependent transfer of HIV from B cells to T cells. in addition to B cells, follicular dendritic cells also trap HIV. this is critical for the pathogenesis of HIV infection. in echo-11 and -12, however, CCP3 of CD55 was identified to be primarily important for the contact. in coxsackieviruses B1, B3, B5, and A21, it was found that CD55 supports the binding of these viruses to the cell surface, but does not facilitate entry and lytic infection. enterovirus 70 has also been documented to use CD55 as a facilitator for virus entry. astroviruses are classified into eight serotypes of which serotype 1 is the most predominant worldwide. early efforts demonstrated that serotypes 1 as well as 2\u20134 effectively suppress complement activation. the coat protein was tested for complement inhibitory activity. complement activation and complement-mediated damage have been reported during Ross River virus infection. resistance to complement-mediated viral clearance has been reported during Sindbis virus infection. a smaller yet more potent analog of this peptide was also made. the infection experiment performed in outbred mice showed that tissue sialic acid content of the host influences the ability to resist the infection. so, these data supported the proposition that host sialic acid content embodies a way of natural resistance to Sindbis virus infection (Hirsch et al., 1983). studies on M1 protein revealed that its N-terminal is capable of interacting with the globular region of A-chain of C1q. such interaction also prevented complement-mediated neutralization of INFLV in vitro. activation of C3 near the viral surface showed efficient deposition of C3b onto the seasonal virus, but not on the pandemic INFLV. we therefore suggest that the pandemic INFLV has devised a subtle mechanism to protect itself from the AP-mediated assault. Johnson et al. performed systematic examination of such incorporation of complement regulators by PIV5 and MuV. they found that both the regulators add to protection from complement. but virion-associated CD55 confers better protection than CD46. all the common isoforms of CD46 (C1, C2, BC1) have been shown to function as MeV receptor. characterization of interaction between meV and CD46 using CD46/CD55 chimeras and monoclonal antibodies showed that the interaction is mediated only by CCP domains 1 and 2. the interaction is mediated only by CCP domains 1 and 2 (Manchester et al., 1997). a more definitive report showed that the CR-2 (CD21) serves as an entry receptor for EBV on the human B lymphocytes. this strategy of using CRs for cellular entry has been shown to be employed by many viruses wherein apart from CR-2, CRs like CR-3 (CD11b/CD18) and CR-1 (CD35) were also shown to be the targets of viruses. vRCA gene family members encode complement regulatory proteins for evading complement system. Viruses of the families Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, Picornaviridae, and paramyxoviridae are known to use complement receptors and receptors. viruses have also been shown to encode their own complement regulators for protection from the host complement. the first virally encoded complement regulator identified was gC of HSV-1 (Friedman et al., 1984) betaherpesviruses do not encode complement regulators, yet cells infected by HCMV were shown to persist in the presence of antibodies to the virus. hCV suppresses the expression of C2, C4, C3 and C9, which in turn can result in inhibition of the CP/LP C3 convertase formation. VCP is a structural homolog of the RCA proteins (Kotwal et al., 1990; Mckenzie et al., 1992; Sahu et al., 1998). it was also shown to accelerate the decay of CP/LP and AP C3 convertases (termed decay-accelerating activity) the protein was named SPICE (Rosengard et al., 2002) because SPICE differs from VCP in only 11 amino acids. subsequent efforts were directed to determine the hotspots in SPICE responsible for this substantial increase in activity. OPICE from the Congo Basin strain reduced disease morbidity and mortality without affecting the viral load. the protein does play a moderate role in pathogenesis. a large part of their genomes encode for genes involved in host control. pesvirinae encode gC that target complement. gCs of HSV type 1 (gC-1) and type 2 (gC-2) have been studied. it was proposed that FcR participates in immune evasion by promoting \u2018antibody bipolar bridging,\u2019 i.e., HSV antibody interacts with the FcR on one end and target antigen on the other resulting in inhibition of Fc domain functions. in vitro studies showed that presence of FcR protects HSV-1 from antibody-dependent complement-mediated neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. the acquired regulators showed a reduction in the infectious titer when incubated with complement. HCMV up-regulates the expression of complement regulators such as CD55 and CD46 on the infected cells. other than HCMV, HHV-7 was demonstrated to up-regulate the expression of CD59 and CD46 on the infected cells during the late stage of infection. Gammaherpesviruses have been shown to encode homologs of the human RCA and CD59 that help them elude the complement system. the presence of a functional homolog of the human RCA was first observed in HVS whose natural host is a squirrel monkey. expression of HVSCD59 on the surface of different cells was shown to protect these cells from complement-mediated damage. similar to HVS, KSHV (HHV-8) ORF4 also encodes an RCA homolog. mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive electrostatic potential in domains 1 and 4 and in linkers between domains 1\u20132 and 2\u20133 influence the complement regulatory activities of Kaposica. bridging of the CUB and MG2 domains of C3b/C4b by Kaposica is critical for imparting cofactor activity. EBV targets complement system for its entry into B cells. it targets CR-1 (Ogembo et al., 2013) as well as CR-2 (Fingeroth et al., 1984; Nemerow et al., 1985; Tanner et al., 1987) direct binding experiments have shown that both gC-1 and gC-2 bind to C3 and its activation products (C3b, iC3b, and C3c), but not C4b. the importance of gC-1 domains that interact with C3b and that blocks properdin/C5 interaction with C3b has also been examined in vivo. in vitro studies showed that presence of FcR protects HSV-1 from antibody-dependent complement-mediated neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. these results also prompted the formulation of a trivalent subunit antigen vaccine for genital herpes which contains gC-2 and gE-2 apart from gD-2. human herpesvirus-6 is a collective term used for two ubiquitous human betaherpesviruses. only a restricted number of non-human primate species show susceptibility to HHV-6. this search led to the identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6. Gammaherpesviruses have been shown to encode homologs of the human RCA and CD59 that help them elude the complement system. they also utilize CRs for cellular entry, which are widely expressed on the host cells. Kaposica is composed of four CCP domains, a dicysteine motif, a serine/threonine (S/T) rich region and a transmembrane domain. spliced variants either lack the S/T region or the dicysteine motif and the S/T region. bridging of the CUB and MG2 domains of C3b/C4b by Kaposica is critical for imparting cofactor activity. the -HV68 RCA was shown to inhibit C3b deposition on the complement activating particle zymosan. the protein was also examined for its role during the infection which suggested that it is vital for viral pathogenesis. EBV protein that specifically interacts with CD21 is gp350/220. gp350/220 mutant lacking N-terminal amino acids was shown to have negligible ligand activity. some serotypes of human AdV have been shown to target CD46. type AdV-37 used the C2 isoform of CD46 as a cellular receptor. it was also shown that the fiber knob protein of these viruses helps them to interact with the extracellular domain of CD46. this interaction requires contact between two N-terminal CCP domains of CD46 with two fiber knob monomers. non-structural protein 1 is a 48 kDa glycoprotein of the flaviviruses. it is synthesized as a soluble monomer that dimerizes upon post-translational modification. it is synthesized as a soluble monomer that dimerizes upon post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum. NS1 from ZIKV is more potent than NS1 from DENV2 and WNV. the soluble hexameric NS1 is also known to interact with C4 and pro-C1s forming a trimolecular complex C4-NS1-C1s forming a trimolecular complex C4-NS1-C1s which promotes the cleavage of C4 to C4b consuming the molecule in solution. the second strategy involves incorporation of host complement regulators onto its envelope. the virus effectively inhibits the expression of C2 (Kim et al., 2014), C4 (Banerjee et al., 2011), C3 (Mazumdar et al., 2012), and C9 (Kim et al., 2013) and thus inhibits the proliferation of T cell. the family Retroviridae is divided into subfamily Orthoretrovirinae and Spumaretrovirinae. the virus contains two identical copies of genomic RNA of 7\u201310 kb. it maintains an intricate balance of complement activation and regulation to achieve maximum infection without undergoing lysis. factor H is another complement regulator abundantly present in the body fluids. HIV has also been demonstrated to recruit factor H on its surface via interaction with gp41 and gp120. iC3b coated HIV display enhanced infection of monocytes/macrophages and DCs expressing CR-3 and CR-4. the complement-opsonized HIV effectively bypasses the SAMHD1 restriction in DCs. in vitro experiments have also shown the CD21 dependent transfer of HIV from B cells to T cells. phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C removes GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C removes GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. in echo-11 and -12, however, CCP3 of CD55 was identified to be primarily important for the contact. the family is composed of two genera \u2013 Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus. the HAstV belong to genus Mamastrovirus and are responsible for causing viral diarrhea in young children. serotypes 1 as well as 2\u20134 effectively suppress complement activation. the protein did not bind to the MBL variant Lys55Gln that fails to bind to MASP-2 and activate the LP. a 30 amino acid peptide of the CoPt inhibited C1 activation. a smaller yet more potent analog of this peptide was made. the ability of the virus to activate AP was inversely related to its sialic acid content. the in vivo clearance rate of the virus with less sialic acid content was higher compared to the virus having more sialic acid content. this was dependent on complement (Hirsch et al., 1981). evasion strategy of INFLV is inhibition of neutralization by blocking the interaction of C1q with antibodies bound to the viral surface. this premise, however, has not yet been tested. we recently compared the susceptibility of the seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus and pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus to AP-mediated neutralization. the pandemic INFLV has devised a subtle mechanism to protect itself from the AP-mediated assault. sensitivity to such neutralization varies depending on cell line through which viruses are passed. both PIV5 and MuV incorporate CD46 which is responsible for the slower rate of their inactivation by the complement system. common isoforms of CD46 (C1, C2, BC1, and BC2) have been shown to function as MeV receptor. the MeV contains two major proteins the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion glycoprotein (F), which mediate cell attachment and membrane fusion. characterization of the interaction between MeV and CD46 using CD46/CD55 chimeras and monoclonal antibodies showed that the interaction is mediated only by CCP domains 1 and 2. largely viruses either acquire or encode proteins that help them subvert the complement system. the salient points that emerge are: (i) viruses target all the three major pathways of complement suggesting that all the pathways participate in controlling viral infections. complement proteins like C3 and C5 can be cleaved inside the cell in a non-canonical way. this implies that opsonization of viruses with C3b may happen even inside the cell. this implies that opsonization of viruses with C3b may happen even inside the cell. a better understanding of this would add to our knowledge of yet unknown immune evasion mechanisms devised by viruses.
