{"summary": "blood samples were collected from 149 patients between 1 and 5 years. clinical information was retrieved via a retrospective review of medical records. blood samples were collected from 149 patients between 1 and 5 years. PCR was performed on the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) patients and clinical data Out of 214 patients admitted to the King Fahd Hospital of the University with diagnosis of LRTI from May 2010 to May 2011. PCR mix-2 detects parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; PCR mix-3 detects parainfluenza viruses 2 and 4; PCR mix-4 detects human coronavirus (hCov) OC43, E229, NL63, and HKUI; PCR mix-5 detects the bocavirus and adenoviruses B,C, and E; PCR mix-6 detects all 100 serotypes of the rhinovirus. blood drawn at the day of admission revealed PCo2 of 36.5, positive C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 38, and no bacterial growth in blood and throat cultures. Chest radiography showed patchy consolidation at right middle lobe. patient was admitted to pediatric intensive care unit as bronchiolitis and bronchopnemonia. she was started on albuterol, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics. she showed improvement within 48 hours in regard of respiratory effort. 18-month-old girl is a known case of bronchial asthma. she was having cough, shortness of breath, vomiting and watery diarrhea for 3 days. her throat and nasal mucosa were congested. complete blood count showed leukocytosis predominantly neutrophilia. electrolyte and hepatic markers were within normal reference ranges. patient continued to spike fever for 48 hours with the highest spike 40.8 \u00b0C. patient showed improvement after 48 hours in regard of respiratory effort and oxygen flow rate. his fever resolved after 72 hours with highest spike of 38.8\u00b0 C. she was fit for discharge after five days of admission. case 3 On December 3, 2010, an 11-month-old girl not known to have chronic illness was seen in the emergency department of King Fahd Hospital of the University with respiratory distress. she was having cough, nasal congestion, and fever for one week. further medical history was unremarkable. analysis of blood drawn at the day of admission revealed PCo2 of 36.5, positive C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 14 and no bacterial growth in blood culture. complete blood count and electrolyte were within normal reference range. our patients were not tested for HBoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate. no other viruses were detected in serum. seropositive PCR could be a more reliable tool in diagnosis. HBoV is a common respiratory pathogen known to be associated with LRTI."}
