{"summary": "nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are thought to be superior in many respects, including sensitivity, specificity, time to virus identification, and range of pathogens detected (1\u20133) it is generally thought that nasopharyngeal specimens are optimal for detecting RVs, particularly when conventional methods are used. acquiring NPSs is not as easy as obtaining other types of specimens, such as saliva specimens. the patients were all male recruits 20 to 26 years of age. most had a history of cough (75.4%), sputum (71.2%), and rhinorrhea (70.3%). 204 (86.4%) were identified, by either of the sampling methods, as being infected with at least 1 RV. isolated No. (%) of positive samples NPS Saliva NPS or saliva 0 53 (22.5) 56 (23.7) 32 (13.6) 1 129 (54.7) 107 (45.3) 106 (44.9) 2 37 (15.7) 55 (23.3) 60 (25.4) 3 16 (6.8) 30 (12.7) 4 1 (0.4) 2 (0.8) 7 (3.0) 5 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 1 (0.4) 2 (0.8) 7 (3.0) 5 0 (0.0) positive samples pa NPS and saliva NPS Saliva ADV 3 3 (1.2) 43 (15.8) 0.0001 INF type A 4 23 (9.0) 8 (2.9) 0.0001 RSV type B 0 1 (0.4) 0 (0.0) NAb PIV-4 2 3 (1.2) 3 (1.1) 1.0000 CoV-229E 6 14 (5.5) 8 (2.9) 0.0565 CoV-OC43 32 41 (16.0) 46 (16.8) 0.3483 EV 70 83 (3 a Kappa (95% CI) PABAK (95% CI) Total Positive Negative ADV 83.1 (78.3\u201387.8) 13.0 (0.0\u201326.3) 90.6 (87.7\u201393.5) 0.11 (0.01\u20130.22) 0.66 (0.55\u20130.75) INF type A 90.3 (86.5\u201394.0) 25.8 (5.4\u201346.1) 94.8 (92.6\u201396.9) 0.22 (0.02\u20130.42) 0.81 (0.71\u20130.87) only 3 samples showed infection positivity in both saliva and NPS specimens. direct sequencing of ADV-positive saliva specimens was performed to exclude any false-positive results. two samples were excluded because of PCR failure. the superiority of sputum samples to NPSs was more evident in the detection of INF type A and RSV type A. sputum requires an additional pretreatment procedure for nucleic acid extraction. some patients, such as young children and elderly patients, cannot produce sputum. lower rates of adenovirus detection from NPS specimens have been reported in several previous studies. this difference may reflect the fact that the major site of initial replication of adenovirus is the nonciliated respiratory epithelium of the oropharynx. the prevalence of RVs ranged from approximately 50% per week to 80% per week during the study period. Specimens containing at least two viruses (coinfection) were detected at rates of 21.1% (54/236 patients) and 30.9% (73/236 patients) among NPS and saliva specimens. comparisons of the two sampling methods revealed that ADVs were detected significantly more often in saliva samples (P 0.0001), whereas INF type A and HRV were detected more often in NPS specimens (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0289), respectively. the differences in detection rates were not statistically significant or could not be statistically evaluated because of the limited number of detected cases. the results of this study showed that the overall performance of saliva samples was equivalent to that of NPS specimens in RV detection by multiplex assays. neither sampling method was consistently more sensitive than the other, based on the types of viruses detected. multiplex RT-PCR was performed using the Anyplex II RV16 detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea), which has been certified for in vitro diagnostic product (IVD) use by Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) marking and the south Korean Food and Drug Administration (FDA) catcher melting temperature analysis (CMTA) was performed by cooling reaction mixture to 55\u00b0C, maintaining it at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and heating it from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. data analyzed by the Seegene viewer software were automatically presented for 16 RVs, i.e., bocavirus, EV, INF types A and B, PIV types 1, 2, 3, and 4, RSV types A and B, ADV, metapneumovirus, coV-OC43 the nucleotide sequences of reference strains for each adenovirus type were obtained from the GenBank nucleotide database and a previous study (30). the nucleotide sequences of reference strains for each adenovirus type were obtained from the GenBank nucleotide database. 256 pairs of NPS and saliva specimens were collected. 20 pairs were rejected because of inadequate quantity or quality. participants received brief explanations regarding difference between saliva and sputum. cDNA synthesis was performed using cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene) cDNA synthesis was performed in a final volume of 20 l, containing 8 l of RT buffer, 2 l of random hexamers, 2 l of RT enzyme and 8 l of nucleic acids. the 16 target viruses were subjected to multiplexed PCR in two tubes, using RV detection kits A and B. the software assigns designations as follows: +++, viruses detected from the first CMTA (after 30 cycles); ++, viruses detected from the second CMTA (after 40 cycles); +, viruses detected from the third CMTA (after 50 cycles). samples containing large viral loads are generally detected during early-cycle analysis; the manufacturer does not provide clear data regarding viral load ranges according to the testing results. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R (version 3.3.1) software."}
