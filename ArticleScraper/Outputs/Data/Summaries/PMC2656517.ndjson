{"summary": "mice were inoculated with sterile broth, 101, 103, 105, 107, or 109 log CFU of a rat-adapted strain of Ureaplasma parvum. inoculum dose affected the incidence of UTI, and 50% to 57% of animals inoculated with 107 CFU remained infected. ureaplasma species are among the most common isolates from the human urogenital tract. the most common host immune response to Ureaplasma during disease states involves elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. however, little work has been done to characterize the immune response. 60% of infected rats developed struvite uroliths that were associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response. the other 40% developed uncomplicated UTI that was characterized by low concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in urine as well as mild to moderate lesions in the lower urinary tract. the pellet was resuspended in 15 to 20 ml of fresh 10B broth instead of saline, to give a final concentration of 109 CFU per ml. for each infection experiment, at least two animals were included in each U. parvum dose group and experiments were replicated a minimum of 5 times. rats were anesthetized and inoculated with sterile broth or U. parvum inoculum into the bladder as previously described. each kidney was transected sagittally so that a portion of the renal pelvis was present in each section. 0 for none, 1 for minimal hyperplasia, ulceration or effacement of epithelium by inflammation. 2 for mild hyperplasia and rare dense inflammatory infiltrates. 3 for the same changes noted in a score of 2. multiple experiments were grouped together in order to make statistical analysis possible. data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA when more than two groups were included in the analysis. a probability of P 0.05 was considered significant. inocula and animal tissues were serially diluted 10-fold in 10B broth to 10-10 and 10-5, respectively. broth cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2; broth cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in ambient air. Necropsy Rats were necropsied at two weeks post-infection. each kidney was transected sagittally so that a portion of the renal pelvis was present in each section. the remaining halves of the right and left kidneys for an individual animal were combined. a standard cocktail was serially diluted in order to develop a standard curve for each analyte that ranged from 3.2 to 2000 pg/ml. an unpaired student's PLSD test was used when the ANOVA indicated a significant difference among group means. results Impact of inoculum dose of U. parvum on colonization rates in the urogenital tract Ureaplasmas were not isolated from any site from any control rat. there was no statistical difference in the log CFU of U. parvum isolated from culture positive animals. however, there was a statistical difference in the frequency of animals that remained infected 2 weeks post-inoculation. animals inoculated with U. parvum were divided into three groups (Negative, UTI, or Struvite) stratified on the basis of culture status and urolith status. negative group consists of animals found to have bladder uroliths regardless of U. parvum culture status at time of necropsy. results are based on culture status and urolith status of animals at time of necropsy. cells could be found within the submucosa regardless of clinical profile. uroepithelial changes ranged from spongiosis of epithelial cells with some necrosis, exfoliation of uroepithelium, or hyperplasia. animals with struvite uroliths had the most extensive lesions and the highest lesion scores. panel B highlights the array of white blood cells that comprised in the inflammatory cellular infiltrate in the tissues of infected animals. the blue arrow is pointing to a neutrophil; the green arrow is pointing to a plasma cell; the red arrow is pointing to a lymphocyte. nonparametric lesion scores were grouped according to the inoculum dose of U. parvum. values in all graphs represent raw lesion scores for each biological replicate. both the inflammatory cell type score and inoculating dose of U. parvum influenced the lesion scores within the Negative group. animals with the most severe kidney lesions had extensive erosion of the uroepithelium, as shown in Figure 3, panel D. other animals, had inflammatory infiltration of the renal interstitium. panel A is a 200 magnification of kidney tissue from a Control rat. there was no correlation between the total area affected score and U. parvum culture status. there was also no correlation between the total area affected score and clinical profile (negative, UTI, or Struvite), additional file 1. Listed Rho values have been corrected for tied lesion scores. the cytokine profile in urine differed among groups. the cytokine profile in urine differed among groups. Fisher's PLSD test revealed that IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- concentrations in the struvite group were significantly greater than control, negative and UTI groups. both Control and Struvite groups showed a significant emphasis in IL-18 and MCP-1, whereas the Struvite group showed a significant emphasis in IFN-. the clustered heat map represents the standardized LS means for each cytokine with a significantly different pattern of expression among clinical groups. values were obtained by one-way ANOVA using a row by row modeling with Fischer C correction for multiple comparisons. the number of biological replicates were n = 6 for control, n = 10 for log 1 CFU, n = 11 for log 3 CFU, n = 8 for log 5 CFU, n = 5 for log 7 CFU, and n = 3 for log 9 CFU. impact of inoculum dose of U. parvum on colonization rates in the urogenital tract Ureaplasmas were not isolated from any site from any control rat. both sitesc 1/14 (7) 1/14 (7) 1/14 (7) 1/14 (7) 2/14 (14) 4/14 (29) NS Probability values were derived by G statistic, P values greater than 0.05 were considered not significant (NS) culated with 107 or greater CFU tended to have the highest frequency of struvite uroliths. Negative group consists of animals found to be culture positive in the bladder and/or kidney but urolith negative. Struvite group consists of animals found to have bladder uroliths regardless of U. parvum culture status. in animals inoculated with U. parvum, bladder lesions associated with inflammation were highly variable. when present, lesions consisted of infiltrates of lympho-plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils that were primarily located within the epithelial layer. animals with struvite uroliths had the most extensive lesions and the highest lesion scores. panel B, C, and D are tissue sections from animals inoculated with U. parvum that had a lesion score of 0 for degree of inflammation, degree of epithelial change and inflammatory cell type. panel B is a 400 magnification of extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia. panel C is a 400 magnification of extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia. panel D are the results of an inflammatory cell type lesion score analysis performed on bladder tissues from animals in the Negative group. a significant number of animals that received log 5 CFU had a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate that included neutrophils as well as mononuclear cells. animals with the most severe kidney lesions had extensive erosion of the uroepithelial barrier. other animals had inflammatory infiltration of the renal interstitium. panel A shows lack of inflammatory lesions that are characteristic in animals inoculated with U. parvum. panel C is a 400 magnification of renal tubules. the black arrow is pointing to extensive hemorrhage and disruption of the uroepithelial barrier by a fibrinous inflammatory infiltrate. there was no correlation between the total area affected score and U. parvum culture status. Listed Rho values have been corrected for tied lesion scores. cytokine profile in urine differed among groups. animals in the Struvite group had the highest levels of GRO/KC. data represent the mean SD of a combination of 5 separate experiments. Urine chemokines were grouped according to clinical profile, control (n = 6), negative (n = 36), UTI (n = 16), and Struvite (n = 13). P values within each graph were obtained by one-way ANOVA. Fisher's PLSD test revealed that IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- concentrations in the struvite group were significantly greater than control, both Control and UTI groups showed a significant emphasis in IL-18 and MCP-1, whereas the Struvite group showed a significant emphasis in IL-1, IL-1, and GRO/KC. only the UTI group showed a significant emphasis in IFN-. two main cytokine cluster patterns were identified in the analysis. the number of biological replicates were n = 6 for control, n = 10 for log 1 CFU, n = 11 for log 3 CFU, n = 8 for log 5 CFU, n = 5 for log 7 CFU, and n = 3 for log 9 CFU. the rat strain is highly susceptible to development of complicated UTI following experimental inoculation with U. parvum. varying the inoculum dose of U. parvum significantly affected the frequency of animals that remained colonized two weeks after inoculation. however, once infected, the proportion of animals that developed complicated UTI did not show a definitive dose response effect. this cytokine profile coincides with the cellular immune response in these animals that consisted of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. this cytokine profile also coincides with the cellular immune response in these animals that consisted of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. there are indicators suggesting that these animals have compromised immune defense. pattern analysis showed this cytokine cluster is unique to animals with struvites. there is a significant positive correlation between IL-1, GRO/KC and the degree of histopathologic change. this suggests that IL-1 and GRO/KC are critical elements in a pro-inflammatory loop that leads to chronic active inflammation. cytokines identified in the negative group included IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-. the second cytokine cluster in the negative group included IFN- and GRO/KC, which are significant cytokines in the UTI and Struvite groups. the clinical outcome to ureaplasmal infection in the rat is similar to what occurs in humans. the complex interactions between mucosal pathogens and the host lead to uncomplicated colonization versus inflammation and disease are largely unknown. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions LR designed and executed animal infection studies and data analysis. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
