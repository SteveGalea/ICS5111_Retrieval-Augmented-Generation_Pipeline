{"summary": "pluripotent stem cell articles published from 1991 to 2012 were screened and retrieved from Science Citation Index Expanded. citation trends for top articles, distributions of journals and Web of Science categories were analyzed. pluripotent stem cells have grown to include embryonal carcinoma cells, embryonic stem cells, embryonic germ cells, and now induced pluripotent stem cells. in the 1960s, pluripotent stem cell function of mouse marrow \"lymphocyte\" (7) was reported by three authors from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the united states. metric analyses of applications relating to stem cell transplantation technology were reported for diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (15), cerebral ischemia (16), spinal cord injury (17), duchenne muscular dystrophy (18) and epilepsy (19). a sharp increase in stem cell research has been observed since 1991 (14). multi-national government funded policies have become equally as influential. the total number of citations since publication to 2012 was referred to as the TC2012 (25, 26) collaboration could be classified as either a single-country article, in which authors\u2019 addresses were from the same country, or an international collaborative article. the records were downloaded and reorganized using Microsoft Excel 2010. 126 articles (4.4%) were single-author articles, 250 (8.8%) had two authors, 257 (9.0%) had three authors, 254 (8.9%) had four authors, 293 (10%) had five authors, 247 (8.7%) had seven authors, 233 (8.2%) had eight authors, 211 (7.4%) had nine authors, 154 (5.4%) had ten authors and 562 (20%) had more than ten authors. the articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular articles in the last 20 years. the articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular articles in the last 20 years. the time span was not sufficient to accumulate a large number of citations. three recently published articles influenced a great number of scientists with which resulted in a TC2012>170, but a TC2012400. the citations to an article within each year should be used instead. a total of 1,553 articles (55% of 2,844 articles) had no citations in the year of publication (C0=0) and 28 articles (0.99%) had more than 30 citations (C0>30) the number of journals in the SCI-EXPANDED database increased from 4,963 in 1997 to 8,471 in 2012. the article published by Nakagawa et al. (44) itself had 128 citations in its year of publication. it is not uncommon that articles with high a TC2012 or C2012 have a low C0. cell Stem Cell (84 articles; IF2012=25.315), Stem Cell Reviews and Reports (58 articles; IF2012=4.523), Nature (56 articles; IF2012=3.060), Journal of Biological Chemistry (41 articles; IF2012=4.651), Nature Protocols (37 articles; IF2012=7.960), and Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (36 articles; IF2012=2.406). of the 2,835 articles with addresses, 2,105 (74%) articles were single-country articles and 730 (26%) articles were international collaborative articles. two North American countries, nine European countries, eight Asian countries, and Australia were in the top 20. 117 7(4.1) 13(1.4) 6(12) 8(2.4) 8(2.4) 8(7.4) 7(3.0) 7(3.0) South Korea 98 9(3.5) 8(2.6) 10(6) 9(2.4) 8(2.4) 8(2.4) Italy 84 10 (3.0) 11 (1.6) 9(7.0) 10(1.7) 11 (1.7) 11 (1.7) Israel 59 12 (2.1) 10(1.7) 15(1.7) 15(3.2) 12(1.5 of the 2,835 articles with address information in the Web of Science, 1,012 (36%) were single institution articles and 1,823 (64%) articles were inter-institutional collaborations. among the top 21 institutions, 13 (62%) were in USA and four (19%) were in Japan. university of California, Los Angeles, USA 53 9 (1.9) 4 (1.8) 15 (1.9) 6 (1.3) 6 (1.2) 6 (1.2) University of Wisconsin, USA 49 10 (1.7) 8 (1.1) 11 (2.1) 8 (1.2) 8 (1.1) University of Cambridge, UK 49 10 (1.7) 4 (1.8) 21 (1.7) 7 (1.2) 7 (1.2) 7 (1.2) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA 47 12 (1.7) 44(0.4) 8 (2.4) 27 (0.4 the distribution of words in article titles, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus has been applied to evaluate trends in research topics. \"word cluster analysis\" has been successfully applied to find the research hotspots for specific topics. the most frequently used author keyword was \"induced pluripotent stem cells\" abbreviation of induced pluripotent stem cells has become acceptable for use in pluripotent stem cell research. the abbreviation has become acceptable for use in pluripotent stem cell research. the articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular articles in the last 20 years. the articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular in the last 20 years. recently published articles have great potential. but they did not have a high TC2012 because the time span was not sufficient to accumulate a large number of citations. the citations to an article within each individual year should be used instead. the lives of the top ten most frequently cited articles in 2012. articles published earlier are at an advantage in having time to gain more citations, compared to those published more recently. the number of journals in the SCI-EXPANDED database increased from 4,963 in 1997 to 8,471 in 2012. the article published by Nakagawa et al. (44) was the only article ranked in the top ten for the categories of TC2012, C2012 and C0. the IF of a journal is defined by the Journal Citation Report (JCR) it is a measure of the frequency with which the average paper in a journal has been cited in a particular year. it is used to evaluate a journal\u2019s relative importance, especially when compared to others in the same field. five indicators have been used to measure research performance by country. these include total, independent, collaborative, first author, and corresponding author articles (49). of the 2,835 articles with addresses, 2,105 (74%) articles were single-country articles and 730 (26%) articles were international collaborative articles. french 127 6(4.5) 6(3.2) 7(8.1) 6(3.2) 6(3.1) Spain 117 7(4.1) 13(1.4) 6(12) 8(2.4) 8(2.4) 8(2.4) 8(7.4) 7(3.0) 7(3.0) south Korea 98 9(3.5) 8(2.6) 10(6) 9(2.4) 8(2.4) Italy 84 10 (3.0) 11 (1.6) 9(7.0) 10(1.7) 11 (1.7) Israel among the top 21 institutions, 13 (62%) were in USA and four (19%) were in Japan. the leading institution was Harvard University in the USA, which published 147 pluripotent stem cell related articles from 1991 to 2012 in SCI-EXPANDED. 0.81) 11 (0.86) Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan 55 8 (1.9) 169 (0.1) 5 (3.0) 166 (0.11) 161 (0.11) University of California, Los Angeles, USA 53 9 (1.9) 4 (1.8) 15 (1.9) 6 (1.3) 6 (1.2) 6 (1.2) University of Wisconsin, USA 49 10 (1.7) 8 (1.1) 11 (2.1) 8 (1.2) 8 (1.1) University of Cambridge, UK 49 10 (1.7) 4 (1.8) 21 the distribution of words in article titles, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus has been applied to evaluate trends in research topics. the most frequently used author keyword was \"induced pluripotent stem cells\" and \"induced pluripotent stem cell\" abbreviation of induced pluripotent stem cells, \"iPS cells\" and \"iPSC\" are more newly used author keywords. the abbreviation has become acceptable for use in pluripotent stem cell research. a steep slope could be found with these two distinguished patterns of citations per year. in the highest percentile, the top 0.1% of authors, a significant percentage have won the Nobel Prize or eventually proceeded to win the award in later years (61). a high correlation between the bibliometric indicators and the number of Nobel Prize achievements was found in chemistry, medicine/physiology, and physics. studies on induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been found to be the most popular research focus in recent years. regenerative medicine continues to progress with the advent of new research findings."}
