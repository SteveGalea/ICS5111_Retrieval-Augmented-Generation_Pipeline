{"summary": "the disease is characterized by a rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia. the causative agent was identified as a novel group 2b coronavirus (16) sporadic cases were reported in late 2003 and 2004 that were caused by different isolates of the virus. 80R binds the S protein with a reported equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) equal to 32 nM. antibody-mediated selective pressure in vitro is known to result in antigenic drift within the RBD, leading to the accumulation of mutations that abolish neutralization by 80R (26). in vitro selections can be used to engineer broadly neutralizing antibodies. but they are predicated on knowledge of the relevant escape mutations. a higher affinity results from a higher Gbinding. pMopac16 contains a pelB leader followed by SfiI sites used for cloning the scFv gene, a human kappa light-chain constant domain for single-chain-antibody-fragment (scAb) expression. icUrbani (AY278741), icGD03-MA, and icHC/SZ/61/03 were propagated in vero E6 cells (22, 24, 38) 105 Vero E6 cells per well and inoculating cultures with 200 l from the 10-fold serial dilutions. cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in complete medium. plaques were visualized by staining with neutral red for 3 to 6 h. pFastbac vector (Invitrogen) was incubated with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of 1 IMAC buffer with 300 mM imidazole. APEx strain Jude1 cells transformed with the 80R scFv library in the pAPEx1 vector were used to inoculate shake flasks containing 20 ml of Terrific broth (TB) medium. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.5, at which point cultures were transferred to a 25\u00b0C shaker for 30 min. cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml 1 PBS with purified RBD. cells were then incubated for 40 min at room temperature on a rotary shaker. spheroplasts were gated based on forward-scatter and side-scatter parameters. 96-well seed plate contains 200 l of TB with 2% glucose and 200 g/ml ampicillin. seed plate was stored with 15% glycerol at 20\u00b0C for future use. cells were pelleted again by centrifugation at 4,500 rpm for 10 min. yl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide\u2013N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry to the level of 300 response units (RUs) samples were injected over the immobilized RBD for 2 min. surface was regenerated by injection of 10 l of 4 M MgCl2 at a 50 l/min flow rate. clones with the lowest off rates compared to 80R were selected for further analysis. 5.4 107 transformants were obtained following electroporation. PCR product from that reaction was cloned into pAPEx1 vector. scFv genes were PCR amplified and subcloned into pMopac16. 96 colonies were inoculated for high-throughput screening. overnight cultures were used to inoculate 500 ml of TB medium with 200 g/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C for 3 h, and protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. cells were resuspended in 12 ml of ice-cold Tris-sucrose solution. the endotoxin levels in the purified scAbs were measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. the purified RBD was immobilized on aCM5 chip as described above, and BSA was used as in-line subtraction. the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored over 72 h. progeny viruses from passage 4 were plaque purified in the presence of antibody. antibody treatment was repeated two additional times, and more rapid CPE was noted. each scAb in the panel (80R, RSK, RS2 and SK4) was serially diluted 1:2 in PBS starting at 30 g/ml. icUrbani, icGD03-MA, and icHC/SZ/61/03 were diluted. recombinant viruses icUrbani (AY278741), icGD03-MA, and icHC/SZ/61/03 were propagated in vero E6 cells (22, 24, 38). titers were determined as PFU by plating 6-well plates with 5 105 cells per well and inoculating cultures with 200 l from the 10-fold serial dilution. the 80R scFv PCR product was digested with SfiI and cloned into the pAPEx1 vector (9) for bacterial display. the gene was subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR using standard protocols (6). insect cells were seeded at 106/ml in 250 ml of medium. the culture supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. the mixture was then loaded onto a 5-ml column and washed with 10 column volumes of 1 IMAC buffer. two to three ml of cells equivalent to an OD600 of 10 were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 350 l of ice-cold Tris-sucrose (0.75 M sucrose and 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) solution. a 50-l portion of 0.5 M MgCl2 was then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min at 4\u00b0C on a rotary shaker spheroplasts were gated based on forward-scatter and side-scatter parameters. scFv genes were amplified by PCR, cloned into the pAPEx1 vector, transformed into cells, and plated on agar plates. resulting clones were subjected to an additional three rounds of sorting. lysates were centrifuged to precipitate the insoluble fraction. clarified filtrate was collected in a 96-well collection plate. surface was regenerated by injection of 10 l of 4 M MgCl2 at a 50 l/min flow rate. the four highest-affinity scFv genes were selected for DNA shuffling. the four isolated genes were first amplified individually by PCR. the DNA products were pooled with a 4-fold molar excess of 80R scFv. they were then digested with 0.125 U of DNase I per 3 g of DNA. 96 colonies were inoculated for high-throughput screening. scFv genes were PCR amplified and subcloned into pMopac16. 96 colonies were inoculated for high-throughput screening. cell lysates were prepared and dissociation rate constants measured. cells were gently mixed for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and 24 ml of 1 mM EDTA was added dropwise. a 1.7-ml portion of 0.5 M MgCl2 was added, and the mixture was incubated further for 10 min. scAbs were purified from the supernatant by IMAC using Ni-NTA agarose. the affinity of the FPLC-purified scAbs was analyzed by injecting the samples over the chip for 1 min for the association phase followed by 10 min dissociation. the surface regeneration was performed with a 12-s injection of 4 M MgCl2. Binding kinetics were calculated using the Langmuir 1:1 model. cytopathology was evident within 48 h (5- and 1-g doses) or was minimal after 4 days (15 and 10 g) low-dose-SK4-treated progeny viruses (1- and 5-g doses) were treated with 5 g of SK4 for two passages and then selected with two additional treatments of 10- and 15-g doses each. high-dose-treated stocks were passaged once in the absence of antibody (pass 2) to restore virus titers. the single-substitution variants are escape mutants developed against monoclonal antibodies. the 80R scFv library was expressed as a fusion to the signal peptide and the first 6 amino acids of NlpA. around 5% of the spheroplasts with the highest fluorescence were collected and re-sorted. scAb clones were labeled with 20 nM RBD. binding was detected with 200 nM anti-FLAG PE. a total of 88 randomly picked colonies from round 4 were grown in a 96-well plate. most of the amino acid substitutions were present in the framework regions, with only one consensus mutation, S167N, being observed in the CDR1 light chain of all four clones. the significance of this mutation was recently highlighted by the studies of sui and coworkers. the 80R scFv was used at a 4-fold molar excess in order to reduce the number of neutral mutations. two libraries were constructed, a shuffled library comprising 5.4 107 transformants and an error-prone library of 1.5 107 transformants. in vitro neutralization escape mutants emerged after three passages in cell culture. three of the four escape variants had the D480Y mutation and one had a Y436H mutation. icUrbani was incubated with the scAb dilution series. a total of nine plaques were isolated from the final selection with 20 g SK4 and sequenced. SK4 successfully neutralized both escape mutants, suggesting an enhanced role for high neutralizing potency. civet strain icHC/SZ/61/03 carries a Y436H mutation associated with increased mACE2 receptor usage. spike proteins of GD03 MA and HC/SZ/61/03 each differ from that of the icUrbani strain at six other amino acid positions within the RBD. at least some of these are critical for antibody binding. 442S, N479I, and D480G emerged following selection with 80R derivative antibodies. SK4 neutralized all six of these escape variants. three of the escape variants, namely, Y436H, Y442S, and T332I, were neutralized with an efficacy comparable to that observed with icUrbani. the 80R scFv library was expressed as a fusion to the signal peptide and the first 6 amino acids of NlpA using the pAPEx1 vector. around 5% of the spheroplasts with the highest fluorescence were collected and re-sorted. 88 randomly picked colonies from round 4, as well as 8 colonies of cells expressing 80R scAb as controls were grown in a 96-well plate. scAb antibody fragments displaying the lowest antigen dissociation rates were expressed and purified to near homogeneity by IMAC followed by gel filtration FPLC. scFv was isolated from round 1 screening; RS2, isolated from round 2 screening; SK4, isolated from round 2 screening; RSK, 80R with S167N, N57S, and S188N mutations. most of the amino acid substitutions were present in the framework regions, with only one consensus mutation, S167N, being observed in the CDR1 light chain of all four clones. rate constants for 80 clones from the third round were analyzed by SPR analysis. the SK4 antibody fragment displayed 270-fold higher affinity than 80R and contained eight amino acid substitutions, including three mutations in common with RS2: N57S, S167N, and S188N. in vitro neutralization escape mutants emerged after three passages in cell culture. three of the four 80R escape mutants carried a mutation from aspartic acid to alanine at position 480 (D480A), and one had a mutation of aspartic acid to tyrosine (D480Y) a total of nine plaques were isolated from the final selection with 20 g SK4. both mutants contained two mutations: N479I and D480Y. mutations at these positions decrease their affinity for hACE2 and hence infectivity. cross neutralization studies of high-affinity scAbs with escape mutants with the D480A and D480Y mutations. SK4 neutralization against several viruses that emerged as escape variants to other monoclonal antibodies reported earlier (21, 26). these viruses contained single substitutions in the RBD, both within and outside the 80R/SK4 interface. SK4 neutralized three other escape variants, with IC50s lower than 80R for icUrbani. icUrbani was the first new major infectious disease to challenge the world population in the 21st century. antibody engineering strategies can be employed to induce broader neutralization breadth and/or higher potency based on affinity improvement. we used random mutagenesis and screening using the bacterial display technique APEx (9) to engineer a series of 80R scFv variants with increased antigen affinity. only one consensus mutation, S167N, was observed in all of the affinity-improved variants. two more mutations, N57S and S188N, were conserved in the high-affinity variants RS2 and SK4 (Fig. 2). when S167N, N57S, and S188N were introduced into 80R, the affinity of the resulting antibody, RSK, increased nearly 100-fold. the combination of all three mutations allows a much better fit to the RBD interface. only the double mutation N479I plus D480Y would allow escape from SK4 binding, as this mutation would disrupt two robust binding residues. 430 to 435 and 469 to 472 of the RBD have been removed to allow better visualization of the structures. high-affinity neutralizing antibodies like SK4 would provide excellent resistance to escape and would be best paired with a broadly neutralizing antibody for a highly effective therapeutic cocktail. incubation with the highest-affinity antibody, SK4, led to no CPE or viral plaques after multiple attempts. a number of studies have established that antibody affinity plays a critical role in toxin or virus neutralization potency in vivo (17, 36) it is thought that during the germinal center reaction in the immune system, kinetic considerations impose a limit on the affinity during the germinal center reaction."}
