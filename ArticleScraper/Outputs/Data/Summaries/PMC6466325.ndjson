{"summary": "the term porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) was used in the past to describe the pneumonia of multiple etiologies that cause clinical disease with negative consequences on productive parameters. the term delineates a more general term describing a polymicrobial syndrome that results from a combination of infectious agents, environmental stressors, population size, management strategies, age, and genetics that causes reduced performance. PRRSV and SwIV are major etiological agents that contribute to PRDC. the virus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. the viral genome, packed by nucleocapsid proteins, contains 11 known open reading frames (ORFs) the only natural host of PRRSV and the virus has a very restricted tropism for cell of the monocytic lineage. the fully differentiated porcine alveolar macrophages have been considered as the cell target for PRRSV [13], but more recently parenchyma macrophage-like/pulmonary intravascular macrophages have been described as supporting PRRSV replication. influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of their hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (NA) molecules. the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer that contains transmembrane proteins on the outside and matrix protein (M1) on the inside. HA provides the receptor-binding site and elicits neutralizing antibodies. pigs can transmit reassortant IVs to humans. swine are susceptible to avian and human viruses. pigs can transmit reassortant IVs to humans. porcine alveolar macrophages are the only natural host of PRRSV. the virus has a very restricted tropism for cell of the monocytic lineage. the fully differentiated porcine alveolar macrophages have been considered as the cell target for PRRSV. ed RNA viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae are classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of their hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (NA) molecules. the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer that contains transmembrane proteins on the outside and matrix protein (M1) on the inside. the three transmembrane envelope proteins\u2014HA, NA, and M2 (i swine are susceptible to avian and human viruses. reassortment of swine/avian/human viruses occurs in pigs. pigs can transmit reassortant IVs to humans. pDC are generally CD172a low/, CD123+, CD135+, CD1+/, CD16+, SLAII+, CD80/86low, and CD14. moDC have been extensively used in the last decade as an in vitro strategy to study the effect of different viruses on pivotal cells driving adaptive immunity. cDC1 SLAIIhi, CD163-, CD172a-/low, CD11c+, Cadm1+ XCR1+ cDC2 SLAIIhi, CD163low, CD172a+, CD11c+, Cadm1+, CD1+ FcRI+ moDC SLAIIhi, CD18+, CD29+, CD44+, SLAII+, CD123+, CD135+, CD14 in vivo NK perforin+, CD2+, CD8+, NKp46+, CD8-, CD11b+, CD16+, CD3-, CD4-, CD5-/low, CD6- No No In vivo T cells divided in 3 subsets. cDC1 or cDC2 have been characterized into three distinct populations according to their functional capacities. M are considered to be antigen presenting cells. they have important regulatory and effector functions in the specific immune response and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. neutrophils are the first line of specialized innate phagocytes during acute pathogens infection. they release antimicrobial peptides, such as several neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) during the NETs formation they release antimicrobial peptides, such as several neutrophil serine proteases. NKp46 expression in pigs defined three distinct NK-cell subsets: NKp46, NKp46+, and NKp46hi CD3 lymphocytes. the majority of CD3+NKp46+ cells express CD8 heterodimer, comparable to porcine cytolytic T cells. a minor subset belongs to the TCR+ T cells. T cells in swine are subdivided into three subsets based on their expression of CD2 and CD8. they include CD2CD8, CD2+CD8 and CD2+CD8+ cells. these individual subsets differ in their homing characteristic and cytotoxic activities. moDC and BMDC generally express CD172a, CD1, CD14 low/+, CD16, SLAII +/hi, and CD80/86. blood cDC normally present CD14, low CD172a, and variable CD1 and CD16 expressions. pDC are generally CD172a low/, CD123+, CD135+, CD1+/, CD16+, SLAII+, CD80/86low, and CD14. in vivo tracheal cDC1 and cDC2 (Resendiz et al. 2018) cDC1, CD163-, SLAIIhi, CADM1+, CD172a, FLT3+, XCR1+ cDC2 CD163-, SLAIIhi, CADM1hi, CD172a+, FLT3+, FcR1+ No N/A In vivo lung DC ( no N/A Macrophages In vivo lung alveolar M CD163+, CD169+, SWC9+ (CD203a), CD172a+, CD14+, CD16+, and SLAII+ Yes Neutrophils In vivo SWC1+ or CD21+, SWC8+ No Not clear NK and T cells In vivo NK perforin+, CD2+, CD8+, NKp46+, CD8-, CD in vitro derived-DC and primary DC present in the respiratory tract. macrophages differentiate in the bone marrow into monocytes, which enter the blood stream. they migrate to the different tissues, where they further differentiate into specific macrophages. porcine lung macrophages can be divided based on the microenvironment within the lung. alveolar macrophages (AM), pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIM) and interstitial macrophages (IM) have been recently included in the so-called AM-like macrophages [14]. NKp46 is an evolutionary conserved mammal receptor that belongs to the family of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) studies considering NKp46 expression in pigs defined three distinct NK-cell subsets: NKp46, NKp46+, and NKp46hi CD3 lymphocytes that display phenotypic and functional properties of NK cells. T cells in swine are subdivided into three subsets based on their expression of CD2 and CD8. they include CD2CD8, CD2+CD8 and CD2+CD8+ cells. these individual subsets differ in their homing characteristic and cytotoxic activities. PRRSV elicits poor innate responses that are associated with incomplete viral clearance in most of the pigs. infection with certain PRRSV strains induces significant suppression of NK cytotoxic activity. the quantity of the innate cytokines secreted in PRRSV-infected pigs is significantly lower. AM-like cells have been defined as macrophages phagocytosing blood-borne particles. they were as permissive as AM to PRRSV-1 lena virus in vivo and in vivo. cytokine production, transcription processes, signal transduction, energy metabolism, immune system, and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection. lncRNAs have been reported during PRRSV and 299 novel lncRNAs were differentially expressed after 12\u201324 hpi. the inhibition is stronger in HP when compared to a low pathogenic strain. 549 specific DEGs, including VAV2, BCL2, and BAX, were enriched in activation of leukocyte extravasation and suppression of apoptosis. on the other hand, 898 specific DEGs were defined in LW pigs, including genes that are involved in the suppression of Gq and PI3K-AKT signaling. inconsistent data about PRRSV infection of other DC subsets are noticeable when primary lung and tracheal DC are considered. a recent publication using primary lung DC showed that PRRSV-1 lelystad virus infects lung DC more efficiently in Duroc than in the Pietrain breed. liaoning et al. show unchanged SLAII but decreased SLAI, CD40, and CD80 [65], and other Chinese high and low pathogenic viruses that modulated CD83 [70,71]. several PRRSV-2 isolates and commercial Ingelvac PRRS MLV vaccine showed no reduction in levels of T CD25+ or IFN+ cells that were cultured with infected moDC. mez et al. [62] considered the problem of moDC markers expression. a suboptimal characterization of the experimental protocol used to generate moDC. disparity is found when considering antiviral factors, on one side moDC responded to PRRSV with increased transcription of IFN. an important outcome was the lack of Treg induction by PRRSV-1 infected moDC. the upregulation of Foxp3+ mRNA and the suppressor activity of Tregs on PHA stimulated lymphocytes were shown. BMDC tested 39 european isolates that were able to induce different patterns of IL10 and TNF production. MHCII upregulation was observed in selected PRRSV-1 strains. lena showed a higher replication rate and apoptosis in BMDC. plasmacytoid DC Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the major source of type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines after exposure to viruses. these cells represent 0.1\u20130.3% of blood leukocytes and their role during PRRS was not clear until 2010 when few groups started to consider the involvement of these cells during the infection. PRRSV exposed pDC remained relatively inert, showing unaltered morphology and CD80/86 downregulation when compared with untreated cells. pDC suppression occurred independent of virus viability and the acidification of pDC early endosomes. pDC did not require live virus and pDC were confirmed to not be permissive to PRRSV. pDC respond to PRRSV-1 and 2 genotypes and suppressive activities are moderate and strain-dependent. viral infection downregulates PMNs antibody-dependent phagocytosis. in infected animals, the expression of FcRIIIA inhibitory receptor decreased and reached the lowest point at 5 dpi in both PRRSV strains. infiltration was determined by the measurement of myeloperoxidase and enzyme activity in the lung, together with qPCR. in the lung, IL8, which is chemoattractant for neutrophil recruitment, was upregulated, and ICAM-1 showed a high level in naturally infected animals. the induction of IL8 by PRRSV was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. cytotoxic T cells were almost double in percentage in all infections. at day 35 pi, cytotoxic T cells were almost double in percentage. NK cells were rarely present in the tonsil and mediastinal lymph node. an interesting study was performed in gilts, which were experimentally inoculated twice with PRRSV-2 MN-30100. T cells responded to PRRSV infection significantly when compared to CD4 at an early stage and they were the major producer of IFN throughout the study. co-incubation with infected PAM inhibited the degranulation of NK cells. the suppressive effect of PRRSV in NK cytotoxicity was not mediated by soluble factors. in this case, immunization enhanced NK and T cells responses. PM-like cells have been defined as macrophages phagocytosing blood-borne particles. they were as permissive as AM to PRRSV-1 lena virus in vivo and in vivo. their infection correlated better with viremia in vivo than AM infection. genes involved in IFN-related signaling pathways, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and processing were significantly downregulated, indicating the aberrant function of PAM during the infection. lncRNAs have been reported during PRRSV and, in particular, 299 novel lncRNAs were differentially expressed after 12\u201324 hpi. 57 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, phospholipase C, granulocyte adhesion, and diapedesis pathways. 549 specific DEGs, including VAV2, BCL2, and BAX, were enriched in activation of leukocyte extravasation and suppression of apoptosis. inconsistent data regarding PRRSV infection of other DC subsets are noticeable when primary lung and tracheal DC are considered. a recent publication using primary lung DC showed that PRRSV-1 lelystad (LV) virus was able to infect lung DC more efficiently in Duroc than in the Pietrain breed. PRRSV-2 reduced the antigen presenting functions of moDC by downregulating the expression of SLAI, SLAII, CD14, and CD11b/c. similar results were obtained with CNV-3 and NVSL 97-7895 [59]. rodrguez-G\u00f3mez et al. [62] considered the problem of moDC markers expression. a suboptimal characterization of the experimental protocol that were used to generate moDC. disparity is found when considering antiviral factors. PRRSV-2 NVSL 97-7895 and CIAD008 showed increased IL10 production during infection. reversible by IFN treatment and upregulation of TGF expression in co-culture, but not IL10. the up regulation of IL1 in duroc could explain the better immune response of Duroc when compared to Pietrain. BMDC were productively infected by PRRSV isolated. BMDC and those cells were only infected when CD163low/hi cells were present. this study questioned the notion of CD163 relevance during the infection. however, the essential role of this receptor for viral uncoating is still supported by the generation of genome edited pigs that lack the CD163 SRCR5 domain. PRRSV-2 was able to stimulate a low but detectable IL2 production. but it failed to induce detectable IL8, IFN, TNF, IL12, and IRF7 production. pDC remained relatively inert, showing unaltered morphology. PRRSV stimulation was observed when compared to mock, suggesting the promotion of pDC survival by the virus. pDC were confirmed to not be permissive to PRRSV. pDC were protected from PRRSV infection and killing when cultured with enriched pDC. pDC respond to PRRSV-1 and 2 genotypes and suppressive activities are moderate and strain-dependent (Figure 1). they may be a source of IFN responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals, further contributing to the puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS. PRRSV-1 LV, Flanders13 and lena did not infect, in vivo or in vitro, lung cDC1 cDC2 and moDC (only some residual infection in moDC) tracheal cDC1 and cDC2 (Table 1) were not susceptible to PRRSV-2 CIAD008 [67]. infected moDC showed high expression levels of CD163 and low CD169. no differences in proliferation and frequency of Foxp3 after co-culturing with infected moDC. an important and surprising finding was the role of Foxp3 Tregs during PRRSV infection. an important and surprising finding was the role of IL10 and Tregs during PRRSV infection. PRRSV infection inhibits TAP1 and ERp57 expression (MHC complex proteins) by the induction of soluble CD83 and an impaired ability to stimulate T proliferation [70,71]. Proll et al. performed the first Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to determine the immune response to PRRSV LV infection in lung DC of two different breeds (Duroc and Pietrain) iBMDC attachment by all of the strain was possible in cells with heparan sulfate (unspecific attachment receptor) removed. iBMDC attachment by all of the strain was possible in cells that lack porcine CD163 or sialoadhesin receptors. iBMDC attachment by all of the strain was possible in cells that lack heparan sulfate (unspecific attachment receptor) in pigs, these cells represent 0.1\u20130.3% of blood leukocytes. their role during PRRS was not clear until 2010 when few groups began to consider the involvement of these cells during the infection. PRRSV-2 46448 was not able to induce the production of IFN in pDCs. summerfield at al. showed how several type 2 strains induced weak or no suppression of IFN in CpG-stimulated pDC and stimulated IFN- in CD172alow CD4hi CD14 pDC. a high percentage of pDC was observed after PRRSV stimulation when compared to mock. infected cells but not lena virions themselves were able to activate pDC independently of the viral strains. this activation required cell adhesion molecules mediating contacts between M and pDC, intact cytoskeleton and sphingomyelinase activity. viral infection downregulates PMNs antibody-dependent phagocytosis and impaired PMNs ability to kill E. coli. in infected animals, the expression of FcRIIIA inhibitory receptor decreased and reached the lowest point at 5 dpi in both PRRSV strains. NK cells were the main cells present in the lung of gnotobiotic and SPF piglets during the first days of infection. cytotoxic T cells were almost double in percentage in all infections. at day 35 pi, cytotoxic T cells were almost double in percentage in all infections. NK cells were rarely present in the tonsil and mediastinal lymph node. but only the CD2+CD8a+ T subset increased. NK cells were not significantly modified during PRRSV-2 infection. approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. reduced frequency of CD4CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ T cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural Treg phenotype were detected. in vitro experiments showed the M culture supernatant from M infected with SwIV H1N2. differences in TNF concentration were detected at different hpi, with a peak at 36 hpi. IL6 and IL8, as well as TNF, were the main pro-inflammatory cytokines that were up-regulated. the authors also observed the induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5, which appeared to be completely suppressed by inhibitors of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2. huIV, LPAI, and HPAI induced an increase of IL12 from 16 to 24 hpi. all of the viruses used induced IL18 secretion in a time-dependent manner. the highest IFN type I responses were achieved by porcine virus reassortants that contained PB2. high levels of IFN were detected upon live, chemically inactivated, or UV-inactivated virus stimulation. heat-inactivated virus failed to induce a response, suggesting non-infectious particles are also stimulatory for pDC. the integrity of HA and its binding function are necessary in inducing IFN responses in pDC. we have defined six populations within the M-DC network in pig trachea and lungs. 1\u2014Porcine alveolar M (AM) CD163hi/CD11b-likeneg. 2\u2014AM-like population, the CD163hi \u2018interstitial\u2019 AM, localized in the interstitium. a 2009 pandemic H1N1 induced less IL1 than swine influenza viruses (SwIVs) in vitro studies revealed that the NS1 C terminus of pandemic H1N1 but not that of SwIV was able to significantly inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL1 production. a new mechanism of innate immune evasion achieved by the NS1 protein in pH1N1/09. NK and T Upon binding to the influenza virus, HA, the receptors trigger the NK cells to lyse the infected cell [117] it has been suggested that invariant NKT (iNKT) cells stimulate the induction of cellular immunity and regulate infection-induced pathology. but there are still few reports on the role of NK cells in swine during influenza virus infection. a significant increase in the frequency of CD3+NKp46+ lymphocytes could be detected in the lungs of infected animals on day 3 pi. a significant increase in proliferation by Ki67+ cells could be detected in the lungs of infected animals on day 3 pi. a comparative study with PRRSV infection, using H1N1 SwIV in germ free piglets, evaluated the different subpopulations of NK and T cells. the CD2+CD8a T subset was comparable to control animals, whereas the CD2+CD8a+ T subset increased. the mesenteric lymph node analysis of T cell subpopulations revealed no significant change in the proportion of any subset [97] IL6 and IL8 levels were up regulated at 16 h and the level of IL8 continued to rise up at 36 hpi. the robust induction of antiviral IFN and TNF family members, which may be attributable to cell death, was also observed. the viral particles from infected-poBMDC were only able to induce a cytopathic effect in susceptible cells when cell-to-cell interaction was favored. however, the viruses similarly modulated the expression of NFB, TGF and IL10 genes. porcine pDC could produce high levels of IFN in response to all of the tested strains. high levels of IFN were detected upon live, chemically inactivated, or UV-inactivated virus stimulation. heat-inactivated virus failed to induce a response. the DC/M network is involved in sensing foreign antigens, controlling inflammation, and initiating the adaptive immune responses. we have adapted a recently proposed nomenclature from Guilliams et al. CD172a/cDC1 produced more IL12A mRNA, the Th1 inducer cytokine, than CD163/cDC1 and CD163low/moDC. in vivo only CD163low/moDC population significantly increased in numbers after both swine (sw)H3N2 and swH1N2 infections. SwIV and lung CD172a/cDC1 produced more IL12A mRNA than their counterparts. 4.2. Neutrophils Neutrophils are important host defense cells against influenza virus during the phase of innate immunity. NKp46+NKcells are recruited from the blood to infected parts of the lungs in swine that were inoculated with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus. a decline in NKp46+ NK cells was demonstrated in the blood of infected pigs. a significant decrease in the number of CD3+NKp46+ lymphocytes in PBMC could be observed in infected animals 1 dpi. a reverse genetics-derived H3N2 SwIV with truncated NS1 and wild type viruses were used to evaluate T cell priming and cross-protective efficacy against heterosubtypic H1N1 challenge. the group with the most robust T cell responses correlated with the greatest cross-protection, suggesting that these cells may have had a protective role during the infection. piglets with different ages were more likely to be co-infected with SwIV. nine and 16-week old pigs were 15.57 and 5.75 times as likely to be co-infected with SwIV. a statistically important association between pre-weaning infection with SwIV and PRRSV and post-weaning mortality was detected. early studies during the 1990s were mainly related to clinical and histopathological findings. the inflammation of the bronchiolar wall was more pronounced in PRRSV/SwIV infected pigs than in PRRSV alone. at the end the PRRSV infection did not aggravate the acute stage of SwIV [128] or SwIV was only slightly affected by prior PRRSV [129]. only in the last five years, Meurens\u2019 group has been the one primarily investigating the more studies are required to precisely define the interaction of both viruses on the immune system and the consequences for disease and vaccination. the whole picture of fine-tuning mechanisms of virus interaction with the host innate immune is far from complete."}
