{"summary": "IHR (2005) has been used as a global tool to collectively respond to the emergence of MERS-CoV from 2012 and the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013. the western Pacific region has been a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases. the region remains vulnerable to future health security threats. the recent avian influenza event reported from china under IHR (2005) demonstrated improved capacities at both national and international levels for response. a significant number of Member States in the Region were unable to meet the IHR (2005) obligations by the required June 2012 deadline. focusing on common capacities will provide a foundation for an all-hazards approach for addressing public health emergencies regardless of causes. implementation of IHR (2005) has been a collective learning process for Member States, WHO and partners."}
