{"summary": "over 170 million people are chronically infected, many of whom develop chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. there is no vaccine against HCV, and the most widely used therapy, pegylated alpha interferon (IFN-) combined with ribavirin with or without small-molecule protease inhibitors, is not universally curative. granules contain stalled translation preinitiation complexes that are induced in response to environmental stress. they contain cellular mRNAs, translational initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF3, and the small subunit of the ribosome. there is growing evidence that several viruses modulate SG assembly (8, 43) ariumi et al. have reported the relocalization of G3BP1 protein and P-body components around lipid droplets in HCV-infected cells. despite these observations, the mechanism by which stress granules are induced during HCV infection and the function of stress granule proteins in the HCV life cycle remain unknown. all cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Cellgro), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C. the subgenomic and full-length JFH-1 stable replicon monoclonal antibodies against G3BP1 and EEA1 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. antibody against -actin protein was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. antibody against -actin protein was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. lentiviral particles were produced in HEK-293T cells by cotransfection of plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and the plasmids necessary for vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentivirus production. cell supernatants were collected at 40 h posttransfection, filtered through 0.45-m filters, aliquoted, and kept at 80\u00b0 for confocal immunofluorescence experiments, cells were grown in glass bottom 96-well plates. at various time points, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature. after extensive washing with PBS, blocking buffer (1 PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 0.3% Trit the next day, the cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 7 h. the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for the detection of mxA, USP18, or GAPDH and G3BP1 proteins. the image-pro Plus package software was used to perform single-cell quantitation analysis of confocal images. the filters were developed using the SuperSignal-West-Pico or -Femto substrate. the images were obtained in a Molecular Imager ChemiDocXRS+. the results are expressed relative to those for control cells using EEA1 or -actin protein expression for normalization and as loading controls. total RNA was extracted from the cells using the guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction method (52) after 20 g of glycogen per sample was added as a carrier. RNA levels were measured by reverse transcription\u2013real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as described previously (52). cell extracts were harvested and the intracellular infectivity, HCV RNA, and viral proteins were analyzed by titration, RT-qPCR, and RT-qPCR. on day 7 the downregulation of each target protein was determined by Western blotting. all cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Cellgro), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C. the subgenomic and full-length JFH-1 stable replicon monoclonal antibodies against G3BP1 and EEA1 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. antibody against -actin protein was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. antibody against -actin protein was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. lentiviral particles were produced in HEK-293T cells by cotransfection of plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and the plasmids necessary for vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentivirus production. cell supernatants were collected at 40 h posttransfection, filtered through 0.45-m filters, aliquoted, and kept at 80\u00b0 for confocal immunofluorescence experiments, cells were grown in glass bottom 96-well plates. at various time points, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature. after extensive washing with PBS, blocking buffer (1 PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 0.3% Trit cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 7 h. they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for detection of mxA, USP18, or GAPDH and G3BP1 proteins. the next day, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. the filters were developed using the SuperSignal-West-Pico or -Femto substrate. the images were obtained in a Molecular Imager ChemiDocXRS+. the results are expressed relative to those for control cells using EEA1 or -actin protein expression for normalization and as loading controls. total RNA was extracted from the cells using the guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction method (52) after 20 g of glycogen per sample was added as a carrier. RNA levels were measured by reverse transcription\u2013real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as described previously (52). cell extracts were harvested and the intracellular infectivity, HCV RNA, and viral proteins were analyzed by titration, RT-qPCR, and RT-qPCR. on day 7 the downregulation of each target protein was determined by Western blotting. cells were infected with the corresponding lentiviruses. endogenous G3BP1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in uninfected Huh-7 cells. TIA-1 and TIAR were located both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. all three markers relocalized in cytoplasmic granules in a subset of HCV-positive cells. sodium arsenite induced SGs in most of the infected and uninfected cells. this suggests that the lack of response in the majority (85%) of cells is not due to an intrinsic defect on the stress response pathway. these results are compatible with recent results suggesting that SG formation is an oscillatory phenomenon during HCV infection (23). -infected (at an MOI of 0.1 for 3 weeks) and uninfected control (Mock) cells were seeded in glass bottom 96-well plates. images displayed are examples of 2-m sections of confocal microscope 40 field snapshots. results were confirmed in 3 independent experiments. results are displayed as percentages of cells containing SGs (mean and SD; n = 5) similar results were obtained in another two independent experiments. HCV infection triggers PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in the cellular protein synthesis without inhibiting HCV translation or replication. PKR-induced PKR activation could be responsible for the SG formation observed in HCV-infected cells. three to five 40 fields were randomly selected, and the cells present in those fields (n > 200) were scored for the presence or absence of stress granules. results are displayed as the percentage of infected cells containing SG. Arrows indicate reduced SG formation in cells in which PKR had been downregulated. these results were confirmed in three independent experiments. we have previously reported that interferon treatment of HCV-infected cells strongly enhances phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2. this effect was not due to an induction in the expression of any of the stress granule proteins G3BP1, TIA-1, and TIAR by IFN. this was specific for HCV-infected cells, since uninfected cells did not contain any SGs even after IFN treatment. IFN treatment enhanced SG formation in subgenomic replicon-containing cells. mRNA and protein content were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. IFN treatment induced the expression of MxA and USP18 mRNAs to similar degrees at the population level in uninfected and HCV-infected cells. mxA and USP18 proteins were highly induced in uninfected cells but poorly or not induced in HCV-infected cells. cells showed a significant positive correlation for GAPDH. there was no correlation at all for MxA or USP18. de novo translation of short-lived mRNAs is impaired in stress granule-positive cells. DH (lower panels) mRNAs (white dots) and the corresponding proteins (in red) as well as G3BP1 protein (in green) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional immunofluorescence after IFN treatment of HCV-infected and uninfected control cells. images displayed are of single 0.3-m z-sections taken in a confocal microscope at a magnification of 40. lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 were transduced with lentiviruses that express shRNAs targeting TIA-1, TIAR, or G3BP1 or a nontargeting shRNA control (shCtrl) one week after transduction, the downregulation of each protein was confirmed by Western blotting. cytotoxicity assays were run with 6 replicate wells per cell type in two independent experiments. downregulated cells were infected with JFH-1 D183 virus at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.2) the intracellular HCV RNA levels and extracellular infectivity were determined on day 6 postinfection. a small but readily detectable fraction of the HCV NS5A and NS5B proteins was specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies to TIA-1 and TIAR, but not the corresponding isotype control antibodies. a small but readily detectable fraction of the HCV NS5A and NS5B proteins was specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies to TIA-1 and TIAR. the results were confirmed in at least 2 independent experiments. TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 are not required to maintain HCV RNA replication once established. lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 proteins were transduced with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1. cells were harvested and the intracellular content of the target proteins and the HCV RNA and NS5A protein content were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. these results were confirmed in 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate. persistently infected cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing shRNA that target TIA-1, TIAR, or G3BP1 or an irrelevant shRNA control. downregulation of TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 proteins in persistently infected cells had little or no impact on the steady-state levels of intracellular HCV RNA or NS5A protein. these results confirm the subgenomic replicon results shown in Fig. 7B. they suggest that TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 are not required to maintain HCV RNA replication once it has been established. the intracellular HCV RNA content was also reduced in TIAR, TIA-1, and G3BP1 downregulated cells early in the infection (24 hpi) the results are consistent with previous reports describing a functional requirement of G3BP1 protein in HCV RNA replication (6, 51) the accumulation of NS5A and core protein (B) was determined at the indicated times postinfection. ea1 protein expression was used as a loading control. RNA and infectivity results are displayed as percentages of the control (shCtrl) at each time point. TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 proteins are required for the assembly of infectious virus. the level of intracellular infectious virus did not increase proportionally to the expansion of HCV RNA in cells in which TIA-1 and G3BP1 were downregulated over time. the results showed were confirmed in 2 independent experiments. TIAR, TIA-1, and G3BP1 proteins regulate early steps that affect HCV RNA and protein accumulation. TIA-1 and G3BP1 proteins regulate early steps that affect HCV RNA and protein accumulation. endogenous G3BP1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in uninfected cells. TIA-1 and TIAR were located both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. all three markers relocalized in cytoplasmic granules in a subset of HCV-positive cells. sodium arsenite induced SGs in most of the infected and uninfected cells. this suggests that the lack of response in the majority (85%) of HCV-infected cells is not due to an intrinsic defect on the stress response pathway. this results are compatible with recent results suggesting that SG formation is an oscillatory phenomenon during HCV infection (23). h-7 cells were seeded in glass bottom 96-well plates, fixed with 4% PFA, and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. in green are stress granule markers (G3BP1, TIA-1, and TIAR); in red, viral E2 or NS5A proteins; in blue, nuclei stained with Hoechst. images displayed are examples of 2-m sections of confocal microscope 40 field snapshots. data are presented as averages and standard deviations (n = 3 to 5). similar results were obtained in another two independent experiments. s PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in cellular protein synthesis without inhibiting HCV translation or replication. cells in which PKR had been downregulated and control cells were infected with JFH-1 D183 virus at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 5) eA1 expression is shown as a loading control. the cells were transduced and infected as for panel A. the wells were processed for detection of cellular G3BP1 and viral NS5A proteins. arrows indicate reduced SG formation in cells in which PKR had been downregulated. this was not due to an induction in the expression of stress granule proteins G3. BP1, TIA-1, and TIAR by IFN suggest that IFN induced the formation of SGs in the infected cells without increasing the intracellular content of these SG proteins. this increase was specific for HCV-infected cells, since uninfected cells did not contain any SGs even after IFN treatment. IFN treatment enhanced SG formation in subgenomic replicon-containing cells. IFN treatment induced the expression of MxA and USP18 mRNAs to similar degrees at the population level in uninfected and HCV-infected cells. in contrast, MxA and USP18 proteins were highly induced in uninfected cells but poorly or not induced in HCV-infected cells. de novo translation of short-lived mRNAs is impaired in stress granule-positive HCV-infected cells. Huh-7 cells were infected (HCV-infected) or not (Mock) with JFH-1 D183 virus at a high multiplicity of infection. 3BP1 protein (in green) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional immunofluorescence after IFN treatment of HCV-infected and uninfected control (Mock) cells. images taken are of single 0.3-m z-sections taken in a confocal microscope at a magnification of 40. one week after transduction, the downregulation of each protein was confirmed by Western blotting. the absence of cytotoxic effects was demonstrated by MTT assay. downregulated and control cells were inoculated with JFH-1 D183 virus at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.2) assays run with 6 replicate wells per cell type in two independent experiments. downregulated cells were infected with JFH-1 D183 virus at a low multiplicity of infection. intracellular HCV RNA levels and extracellular infectivity were determined on day 6 postinfection by RT-qPCR. these observations confirm and extend a prior report demonstrating the colocalization of the HCV core protein and G3BP1 in lipid droplets (6). these results suggest that the stress granule proteins might play a direct role in HCV infection by interacting with NS5A, core, and possibly other HCV proteins. these results were confirmed in at least 2 independent experiments. TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 are not required to maintain HCV RNA replication once it has been established. lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1. cells were harvested eight days after transduction. downregulation of TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 had no impact on steady-state levels of HCV RNA or NS5A protein. persistently infected cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing shRNA that target TIA-1, TIAR, or G3BP1 or an irrelevant shRNA control (shCtrl) seven days after transduction, the supernatants were collected and the cells were harvested for further analysis. TIAR, TIAR, and G3BP1 proteins in persistently infected cells had little or no impact on the steady-state levels of intracellular HCV RNA or NS5A protein. these results confirm the subgenomic replicon results shown in Fig. 7B. they suggest that TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 are not required to maintain HCV RNA replication once it has been established. TIA-1, TIA-1, and G3BP1 proteins are required in early and late steps in the HCV life cycle. levels in TIAR, TIA-1, and TIA-1 downregulated cells early in the infection (24 hpi) and recovered to normal levels in almost all cells in which the proteins had been downregulated over the time course of the experiment. the accumulation of the intracellular HCV RNA and intracellular and extracellular infectivity (C) was determined at the indicated times postinfection by Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and titration assays. RNA and infectivity results are displayed as percentages of the control (shCtrl) at each time point. the level of intracellular infectious virus did not increase proportionally to the expansion of HCV RNA in cells in which TIA-1 and G3BP1 had been downregulated over time. these results suggest that TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP1 proteins are required for the assembly of infectious virus. h-7 cells were transduced with one or two lentiviruses as indicated. intracellular HCV RNA and infectivity titers and extracellular infectivity titers were determined 24 h later. the results were confirmed in 2 independent experiments, each one performed in triplicate. cytoplasmic structures containing SG proteins (G3BP1, TIA-1, and TIAR) are required at both early and late steps during HCV infection. the results are consistent with previous observations by Jones et al. PKR downregulation almost completely abolished the formation of SGs in HCV-infected cells. but IFN did not trigger SG formation in uninfected cells despite higher levels of PKR expression. however, IFN did not trigger SG formation in uninfected cells despite higher levels of PKR expression. SG formation in HCV-infected cells reflects the ability of HCV to trigger PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation and translational inhibition. transient SG induction might allow the survival of the cells that otherwise could die as a consequence of prolonged inhibition of translation. this could indirectly promote viral persistence, since it has been previously demonstrated that SG induction prevents apoptosis (5). the downregulation of TIA-1 and TIAR showed differential effects in acutely and persistently infected cells. both proteins were required for efficient HCV RNA and protein accumulation early after de novo infection. but they were dispensable in ongoing infections, suggesting that initiation and maintenance of HCV RNA replication are differentially regulated. cipitated with an overexpressed myc-G3BP1 construct in HCV-infected cells. they suggested that G3BP1 is present in replication complexes (51) we were not able to detect any specific coimmunoprecipitation of core, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A or NS5B protein with the endogenous G3BP1 protein."}
