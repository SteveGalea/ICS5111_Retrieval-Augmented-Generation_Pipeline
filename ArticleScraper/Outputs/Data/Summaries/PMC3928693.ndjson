{"summary": "the first line of such defense is termed as the innate immune response as it is evolutionarily older. it depends upon recognition of highly conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by a series of germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) these receptors are expressed on a range of cells which respond to pathogenic threats by a number of means such as engulfment of pathogen, production of antimicrobial peptides and acid hydrolases. precursors of T lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow and colonize the thymus. these lymphocytes stay in circulation throughout adult life sensing non-self entities. intrinsic defects in cells of the immune system accumulate over a period of time manifesting themselves in the inability of the aged to mount an effective immune response against infectious disease. macrophages/monocytes are present in all tissues and are the first cells to encounter particulate matter apart from neutrophils. it has been observed that macrophages from aged individuals have lower expression of surface molecules like major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II)9 and toll like receptors (TLRs) which could adversely impact their antigen presentation, produce poor levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- when stimulated neutrophils are armed with antimicrobial arsenal like superoxide, reactive nitrogen intermediates, antimicrobial peptides and degradative enzymes. chemotaxis, production of superoxide and ability to respond to survival signals from granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor are compromised. presence of these apoptotic cells at the site of infection could delay the resolution of infection resulting in persistent inflammation. the developing B cells undergo a series of stages characterized by the presence of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin gene recombination. they are termed as pro-B cells, pre-B cells, immature-B cells, transitional-B cells and mature-B cells17. their interaction with bone marrow stromal cells is very crucial for their development. cytidine deaminase (AID) and E47, the transcription factor that controls its expression, are downregulated in aged murine B cells due to decreased mRNA stability. age related changes affect B cell population partly because of T cell dysfunction in the elderly. the effects of ageing on nave T cells are more researched and documented than any other cell populations. ageing results in other functional defects as well as decreased T cell repertoire, decreased interleukin (IL)-2 production and an increased memory T cell population. chemotaxis, phagocytosis and respiratory burst are also compromised in the elderly. dendritic cells are another major component of the innate immune responses that are present in all tissues. they mature and migrate to the nearest lymph node. natural killer (NK) cells originate from common lymphoid progenitors that give rise to T and B lymphocytes. they do not express unique antigen receptors as expressed by either B cells or T cells. they mediate MHC-independent killing of virus-infected cells or tumour cells. B cells at immature-B cell stage expressing IgM on surface migrate to secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes or spleen. either the B cells migrate to the medulla of lymph nodes, complete their differentiation and undergo class switching, becoming antibody secreting plasma cells or migrate into a nearby follicle. ageing affects B cell responses quantitatively, indicated by reduced antibody production. antigen presenting cells (APCs) pick up invading organisms by phagocytosis and migrate to regional lymph nodes. they encounter diverse population of nave T cells produced continuously by a well-functioning thymus. macrophages/monocytes are present in all tissues and are the first cells to encounter particulate matter apart from neutrophils. innate immune systems such as macrophages, DCs and neutrophils are adversely affected with advancing age. longerhans cells are DCs present in skin and their numbers decrease with age12. they also have lower numbers of co-stimulatory molecules and lower production of IL-12. some of the age related dysfunction observed in aged individuals could be related to changes in the effectiveness of the DC population in the aged. effects of ageing on adaptive immunity B lymphocytes are crucial for humoral immunity. these cells originate in foetal liver or adult bone marrow from HSCs. some cells from CLPs differentiate into B cells under the influence of the bone marrow microenvironment. reduced antibody production and qualitatively, evident in the production of lower-affinity antibodies. a decrease in bone marrow output and reduction in numbers of HSCs committing to B cell lineage in the aged mice. class switching produces essentially an antibody with the same specificity. in the germinal centre antigen-specific T cells provide help to B cells for class switching. efficiency of APC migration and making stable contact with T cells decreases. thymic output also decreases in the aged host further compromising immune response. early thymic progenitors (ETPs) develop gradually through successive stages of differentiation from CD4-CD8- double negatives (DNs), to CD4+CD8+ double positives (DPs), to either CD4+ or CD8+ single positive (SPs) T cells restrict their lineage options at each stage. development and schooling of T lymphocytes takes place in the thymus. DN2 cells migrate deeper into the cortex. interaction with thymic epithelial cells leads to differentiation into DN2 stage. DN2 cells carry the potential to differentiate into NK cells and DCs apart from T cell potential. DN3 cells migrate back towards the medullary cortex losing expression of CD25. signaling through the pre-TCR leads to the expression of CD4 and CD8 both on the surface of cells resulting into CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) cells. DP cells undergo positive or negative selection by interacting with self-peptide MHC (pMHC) complex expressed on fibroblasts, DCs and TECs. GATA3 deficient foetal liver cells give rise to very few ETPs. expression continues until the DN3 stage after which it subsides. expression continues until the DN3 stage after which it subsides, again becoming upregulated in single positive CD4+ cells. adult mice lacking both CCR7 and CCR9 fail to recruit any T cell progenitors to the thymus21,34. thymocytes undergo positive selection by their interactions with self-pMHC. thymocytes undergo positive selection by their interactions with self-pMHC. CD4+ T cells engrafted into recombinant activating gene Rag-2-/- MHC II-/- mice gradually decline over a period of 6 months. this suggests low level interactions of self-pMHC with TCR play a significant role in long term survival and maintenance of the nave T cell pool. cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-1542 cannot survive in absence of c. IL-7 is also required for proliferation of nave CD4+T cells in a lymphopenic condition. a foreign peptide loaded MHC molecule occurs in the T cell zone of secondary lymphoid organs. such a TCR-pMHC interaction leads to the formation of an immunological synapse. this is a localized accumulation of the TCR complex and associated intracellular signaling molecules. DAG activates PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. IP3 causes the release of intracellular calcium leading to the activation of calcineurin. both these transcription factors drive the expression of several genes required for the activation and proliferation of T cells. ICOS boosts T cell differentiation, cytokine production and immunoglobulin production. IL-2 is the primary cytokine driving T cell proliferation. it is a 15.5 kDa secretory molecule produced by activated T cells. cytokine milieu and expression of specific transcription factors determine the outcome of an infection by guiding CD4 T cells toward distinct effector populations. a combination of IL-12 with STAT-4 and T-bet helps in the differentiation of the Th2 lineage that secretes interferon (IFN)- and is important for the clearance of intracellular pathogens. TGF- along with IL-2 promotes the differentiation of T regulatory (Treg) cells that help in preventing autoimmun memory T cells could be subdivided based on the expression of surface markers as central memory T cells (TCM) and effector memory T cells (TEM) TEM migrate to inflamed peripheral tissues and on TCR stimulation rapidly produce inflammatory cytokines providing protection from ongoing infection53. DN2 cells go through a transition from an early DN2a (CD4-CD8-CD3-CD44+CD25+CD117int) stage having the potential to give rise to DCs and NK cells to a late DN2b (CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+CD117int) stage. DN3 cells begin to rearrange -chain locus, losing expression of CD25. DP cells undergo positive or negative selection by interacting with self-peptide MHC (pMHC) complex expressed on fibroblasts, DCs and TECs. most cells fail to make it through, and die in the process. many transcription factors are activated and silenced during this process. GATA3 deficiency has no effect on survival or proliferation, indicating that GATA3 most likely regulates differentiation of early T cell progenitors32. expression of both these transcription factors BCL11b and GATA3 is induced by another transcription factor, T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) which is expressed in ETPs and is strongly upregulated by Notch signaling. TCF-1 deficiency leads to decreased thymic cellularity. chemokine ligand CXCL12 blocks migration of thymocytes from the cortico-medullary junction to the cortex. these fail to progress from DN1 stage to later stages of development35. thymocytes undergo positive selection by their interactions with self-pMHC. study found low level interactions of self-pMHC with TCR play a significant role in long term survival and maintenance of the nave T cell pool. despite contradictory initial claims, it is now well established that homeostatic proliferation requires low threshold of TCR activation. cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-1542 have been shown to be critically involved in the proliferation and survival of nave T cells. IL-7 is also required for proliferation of nave CD4+T cells in a lymphopenic condition where it acts by upregulating b cell lymphoma Bcl-2. Binding of the TCR complex with pMHC leads to phosphorylation of immunoreceptor-Tyrosine based activation motifs. this creates a binding site for zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP)-70. after activation, phosphorylated ZAP-70 phosphorylates scaffold proteins linker of activation of T cells. both these transcription factors drive the expression of several genes required for the activation and proliferation of T cells, including IL-247. in the absence of co-stimulation, T cells become unresponsive which is described as 'anergy' members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family CD27, CD40, OX40 and 4-1BB are other important co-stimulatory molecules. key among such molecules is a homologue of CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1. IL-2 is the primary cytokine driving T cell proliferation. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are required for the development of the Th2 lineage that secretes interferon (IFN) and is important for the clearance of extracellular pathogens. TGF- along with IL-2 promotes the differentiation of T regulatory (Treg) cells that help in preventing autoimmunity and generation of tolerance. developmental stages of T cell progenitors are determined by thymic microenvironment. early ETPs enter the thymus from blood vessels near the cortico-medullary junction. these early ETPs are characterized as CD4-CD8-CD3-CD44+CD25- double negative (DN1) cells. DN2 cells go through a transition from an early DN2a (CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+CD117int) stage having the potential to give rise to DCs and NK cells to a late DN2b (CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+CD117int) stage. DN3 cells begin to rearrange -chain locus. transcription factors are activated and silenced during this process. one transcription factor is BCL11b (B cell lymphoma 11b), a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed at the DN2 stage. it suppresses NK cell and myeloid lineages and starts expressing NK cell lineage genes. TCF-1 deficiency leads to decreased thymic cellularity. overexpression of TCF-1 leads to induction of T cell lineage programme. T cell development within the thymus is location specific. pMHC is a very important role in localizing thymocytes in the different microenvironments within the thymus leading to their appropriate development into functional T cells. the small pool of nave T cells that survive are the cells with optimal binding ability to MHC. the role of self-pMHC in maintenance of the nave T cell pool has been reported in several studies. despite contradictory initial claims, it is now well established that homeostatic proliferation requires low threshold of TCR activation that is provided by self-pMHC complex. a unique gene pattern is neither observed nor seems to be required for such proliferation in nave CD8 T cells40. IL-7 is required for proliferation of nave CD4+T cells in lymphopenic condition. it acts by upregulating b cell lymphoma Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. IL-7 is also required for proliferation of nave CD4+T cells in a lymphopenic condition. kinases of the Src family create binding site for zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP)-70. phosphorylates scaffold proteins linker of activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein (SLP)-76. in the absence of co-stimulatory signals, T cells become unresponsive. CD28 signaling works by activating phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway (PI3K) PI3K leads to the activation of Akt, which phosphorylates many proteins. IL-2 is the primary cytokine driving T cell proliferation. it acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner via IL-2 receptor. signaling by IL-2R leads to activation of Akt, MAP kinase and JAK-STAT pathways. transforming growth factor (TGF)- and IL-6 along with RORt are required for the differentiation of the Th17 lineage. TGF- along with IL-2 promotes the differentiation of T regulatory (Treg) cells that help in preventing autoimmunity and generation of tolerance. the process of ageing affects all the cells including HSCs. a shift in balance from the lymphoid lineage in young adults to the myeloid lineage in the elderly. the process of ageing affects all the cells including HSCs. an aged thymus is characterized by reduction in overall size along with an increase in nonfunctional, non-thymopoietic perivascular space and a decrease in functional, thymic epithelial space. this is accompanied by a loss of organized thymic architecture and increased deposition of adipocytes within the thymus60. chemical castration of male mice reverses age related thymic decline and restores thymic function. androgen levels decrease in humans with age, yet there is no observable reversal of thymic involution with age. thymus gains full functionality right after birth and starts declining within a year. cytokines of the IL-6 family are secreted by the thymus and have a potent effect on nave T cells. levels of IL-7, a cytokine crucial for maturation and maintenance of thymocytes, stays constant66. more investigation needs to be done to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of thymic involution. in a young mouse the nave T cell pool is very dynamic. in response to cognate antigens, some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. some never encounter their cognate antigen and thus keep recirculating through the secondary lymphoid organs. a decline in diversity leads to a restricted T cell repertoire that has severe consequences for the immune response of the elderly68. the number of aged nave CD4 T cells in the periphery falls to half as compared to cells from a young mouse72. nave CD4 T cells from aged mice were also found to be impaired in their functionality both in vitro and in vivo conditions. the frequency of nave CD4 T cells from aged mice undergoing apoptotic death was more as compared to nave CD4 T cells from young mice76. nave CD4 T cells show reduced production of IL-2 and proliferation. this could explain poor generation of either a Th1 or Th2 response. effectsors generated from aged nave CD4 T cells show reduced expression of differentiation and activation markers like CD25 and CD62L. in memory cells generated from aged nave CD4 T cells. impairment in the generation of functional memory could not be overcome even by exogenous IL-2 treatment80. the elderlies show increased susceptibility towards established (e.g. influenza, pneumococcus, etc.) growth hormones, keratinocyte growth factor and IL-7 show promising results in inducing thymopoiesis and reversing age related thymic involution. growth hormone treatment has been shown to increase thymic cellularity and an increase thymocyte response to mitogen stimulation85,86. the process of ageing affects all the cells including HSCs, despite their self-renewal capabilities. the process of ageing affects all the cells including HSCs, despite their self-renewal capabilities. the process of thymic involution is a gradual decline in the structural integrity of the thymus with age, resulting in an atrophied thymus. this structural waning of the thymus results in a steady decline in the production of nave T cell numbers leading to a restricted TCR repertoire. the thymus represents a major component of the immune system, where T cell progenitors undergo differentiation, generate TCR diversity, become self-restricted mechanism proposed for thymic involution is puberty and evidence comes from the fact that chemical or surgical castration of male mice leads to sex steroid ablation, reverses age related thymic decline and restores thymic function. in mice, the time between weaning and sexual maturity is not that far apart and coincides with the beginning of thymic involution. cytokines of the IL-6 family are secreted by the thymus and have a potent effect on nave T cells. the levels of IL-7, a cytokine crucial for maturation and maintenance of thymocytes, stays constant66. the decline of nave T cell numbers in the periphery is directly associated with this phenomenon. in a young mouse the nave T cell pool is very dynamic. in response to cognate antigens, some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. in the aged individual this balance is disturbed with the decline of RTEs. oligoclonal repertoire diversity is maintained until the sixth decade of life in humans. decline in diversity leads to a restricted T cell repertoire that has severe consequences for the immune response of the elderly68. the frequency of nave CD4 T cells from aged mice undergoing apoptotic death after activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies was more as compared to nave CD4 T cells from young mice76. a higher frequency of nave CD4 T cells from aged mice showed decreased CD4 expression and were found to be smaller in size with lower mitochondrial mass. effectsors generated from aged nave CD4 T cells show reduced production of IL-2 and proliferation when stimulated with APCs. this could explain the poor generation of either a Th1 or Th2 response. inability of aged nave CD4 T cells to activate, produce IL-2 and proliferate also affects their ability to provide cognate help. cytokine secretion and impaired cognate help were also observed in memory cells generated from aged nave CD4 T cells. the elderlies show increased susceptibility towards established (e.g. influenza, pneumococcus, etc.) and emerging (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus) pathogens81. growth hormones, keratinocyte growth factor and IL-7 show promising results in inducing thymopoiesis and reversing age related thymic involution. growth hormone treatment has been shown to increase thymic cellularity and an increase thymocyte response to mitogen stimulation85,86. the process of ageing affects all the cells including HSCs, despite their self-renewal capabilities. the process of ageing affects all the cells

cognate antigens, some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. some nave T cells get activated and move out of the pool68. however, the nave T cell pool is maintained at a constant level. fewer nave T cells die and more memory T cells expand leading to an oligoclonal repertoire. a decline in diversity leads to a restricted repertoire that has severe consequences for the immune response of the elderly68. signaling molecules downstream of TCR, e.g., Lck and LAT, in their phosphorylated forms was also delayed to lipid rafts75. these defects adversely influence the strength of signal generated by TCR and are manifest downstream of the initial signaling event. decline of co-receptor expression could be an indicator of global changes associated with age associated dysfunction of nave CD4 T cells. IL-2 is a key cytokine required for survival and proliferation of T cells. this could explain the poor generation of either a Th1 or Th2 response. age related changes in the immune system adversely affect the ability to fight infections and show decreased efficacy to immunization. the elderlies show increased susceptibility towards established (e.g. influenza, pneumococcus, etc.) pathogens. growth hormones, keratinocyte growth factor and IL-7 show promising results in inducing thymopoiesis and reversing age related thymic involution. growth hormone treatment has been shown to increase thymic cellularity and an increase thymocyte response to mitogen stimulation85,86. enhancing the T cell responses by renewing the cells present and/or by designing vaccines and adjuvants specifically tuned to generate strong responses."}
