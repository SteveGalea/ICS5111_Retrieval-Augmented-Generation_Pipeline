{"summary": "influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus in the first peak period of influenza activity during the second half of January 2012. influenza B was the predominant virus in the second peak period of influenza activity during the second half of March 2012. the aim of this study was to compare clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or influenza B. influenza A (H3N2) appeared first in the Republic of Korea and Japan followed by influenza B, with the reverse sequence occurring in China and Mongolia. influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus in the second peak period of influenza activity during the second half of March 2012. influenza B increased markedly late in the season, even though influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus during the 2011\u20132012 winter influenza season. the Institutional Review Boards of the Catholic University St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Inha University Hospital, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University Kuro Hospital, and Wonju Christian Hospital have reviewed and approved all protocols of this study. a rapid influenza detection test was performed bedside and a multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction test was performed. ILI was clinically defined as the sudden onset of fever37.8\u00b0C and the presence of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms. Pneumonia was defined as influenza with pulmonary infiltrate and/or hypoxia. primary viral pneumonia was defined as pneumonia without documented bacterial pathogen. NL63, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus were tested to differentiate influenza virus subtypes using Seeplex\u00ae Influenza A/B Onestep Typing (seegene, Korea) a multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction test was performed using the nasal/throat swab specimens. influenza patients who were confirmed to have complications or have clinical symptoms limiting physical activities severely were hospitalized. the decision to recommend hospitalization for patients with influenza was made by the infectious disease specialist of each participating hospital. data on demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and relevant physical findings, prior history of influenza vaccination, underlying medical conditions, treatment regimens, laboratory results, days of hospital stay, and influenza-related mortality were collected for all eligible patients. multiplex PCR using Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection (seegene, Korea) was performed to detect influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E/NL63, respiratory syncy 656 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H3N2) and 194 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza B were enrolled and prospectively compared for clinical features, laboratory parameters, complications, and clinical outcomes. two female patients were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H3N2) and then laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H3N2) began to be seen again in week 52 (Dec 18Dec 24) and then laboratory-confirmed influenza A ( the rates of influenza vaccination in patients with influenza A (H3N2) and B in this season were 25.2% and 17.0%, respectively. the rates of influenza vaccination in patients with influenza A (H3N2) and B in this season were 25.2% and 17.0%, respectively. 0.085 Diabetes mellitus 61 (9.3) 9 (4.6) 0.038 Hypertension 135 (20.6) 14 (7.2) 0.001 Malignancy 29 (4.4) 3 (1.5) 0.084 Neuromuscular diseases 5 (0.8) 0 (0) 0.594 Organ recipients 1 (0.2) 1 (0.5) 0.405 Pregnancy 17 (2.6) 4 (2.1) 0.798 At least one of the above conditions 243 (37.0) 36 (18.6) 0.001 Not report for the of the 656 influenza A and 194 influenza B patients, 254 influenza A and 41 influenza B patients had been tested for routine laboratory findings at initial presentation. the mean age of 295 influenza patients who had been tested for routine laboratory findings was higher than that of those who had not been tested. no significant differences in initial levels of hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, albumin, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, or prothrombin time.
