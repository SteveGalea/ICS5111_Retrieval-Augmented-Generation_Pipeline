{"summary": "emergence and re-emerging infectious diseases are undoubtedly one of humankind\u2019s most important health and security risks. as epidemic threats increase so is the potential impact of mathematical and statistical inference and simulation approaches to guide prevention and mitigation plans. in this paper we review and illustrate a simple data assimilation framework for connecting ordinary differential equation models to time series data. this frequentist approach relies on modeling the error structure in the data unlike Bayesian approaches which always raise the question of how to set priors for the parameters. the generalized-growth model (GGM) is a phenomenological model that has proved useful to characterize and forecast early epidemic growth patterns. the generalized-growth model allows relaxing the assumption of exponential growth via a \u201cscaling of growth\u201d parameter, p. in semi-logarithmic scale, exponential growth patterns are visually evident when a straight line fits well several consecutive generations in the growth pattern. downward curvature in semi-logarithmic scale indicates early sub-exponential growth dynamics. model enables us to capture different growth profiles ranging from constant incidence ( p = 0 ), polynomial growth ( 0 p 1 ), to exponential growth ( p = 1 ). this model has been useful to generate post-peak forecasts of Zika and Ebola epidemics. the simplest and most popular mechanistic compartmental model for describing the spread of an infectious agent in a well-mixed population is the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model. infected individuals experience a mean latent and a mean infectious period given by 1 / k and 1 /. the number of infectious individuals grows following an exponential function during the early epidemic growth phase, e.g., I ( t ) I 0 e ( ) t where the average number of secondary cases generated per primary case, R 0, is simply given by the product of the mean transmission rate ( ) and the mean infectious period ( 1 ) as follows: R 0 =. the solution C ( t ) describes the cumulative number of cases at time t. r is a positive parameter denoting the growth rate. p = 1 leads to the well-known exponential growth model. the generalized-growth mode (GGM) is a phenomenological model that has proved useful to characterize and forecast early epidemic growth patterns. previous analyses highlighted the presence of early sub-exponential growth patterns in infectious disease data across a diversity of disease outbreaks (Viboud et al., 2016). intermediate values of p between 0 and 1 describe sub-exponential growth patterns. in semi-logarithmic scale, exponential growth patterns are visually evident when a straight line fits well several consecutive generations in the growth pattern. downward curvature in semi-logarithmic scale indicates early sub-exponential growth dynamics. this model enables us to capture different growth profiles ranging from constant incidence ( p = 0 ), polynomial growth ( 0 p 1 ), to exponential growth ( p = 1 ). this model has been useful to generate post-peak forecasts of Zika and Ebola epidemics. the simplest and most popular compartmental model for describing the spread of an infectious agent in a well-mixed population is the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model. infected individuals experience a mean latent and a mean infectious period given by 1 / k and 1 /. in a completely susceptible population, e.g., S ( 0 ) N, the number of infectious individuals grows following an exponential function during the early epidemic growth phase. however, as the number of susceptible individuals in the population declines due to a growing number of infections, the effective reproduction number, R t, is given by the product of the mean transmission rate ( ) and the mean infectious period ( 1 ). in a completely susceptible population, e.g., S ( 0 ) N, the number of infectious individuals grows following an exponential function during the early epidemic growth phase. the effective reproduction number over time, R t, is given by the product of the mean transmission rate ( ) and the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population: R t = S ( t ). in general, we denote the time series of n longitudinal observations by y t i = y t 1, y t 1,..., y t n where i = 1,2,..., n where t i are the time points of the time series data. in our examples below, we make use of simulated data as well as outbreak data, which has been used in previous studies. the model solution f ( t i, ) yields the best fit to the time series data y t i. the standard deviation of the errors (deviation of model to data) is invariant across the time series. weights assigned to observations decrease exponentially as we move from recent to older data in the time series. the higher the value of alpha, the more weight is given to recent data relative to older data. weighted least squares can be useful to assign relative weights to each data point in our dataset. weights assigned to observations decrease exponentially as we move from recent to older data in the time series. corresponding weight for observation t i is given by: w t n i = ( 1 ) i 1 where i = 0,1,2... n 1 where parameter 0 1 regulate the rate at which the weights decrease exponentially. we can fit the GGM to the first 15 weeks of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone via least-square fitting using the Matlab built-in function lsqcurvefit.m. the initial number of cases C ( 0 ) is fixed according to the first observation week in the data (i.e., C ( 0 ) = 3. we employ the weekly series of the number of reported Ebola cases in Sierra Leone during the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in west africa. blue circles are the weekly case series while the solid, dashed, and dotted lines correspond to the best fits of the GGM to the data for various values of the parameter. step-by-step algorithm to quantify parameter uncertainty follows. derive the parameter estimates = ( 1, 2, m ) through least-square fitting the model f ( t i, ) to the time series data y t i = y t 1, y t 1,..., y t n to obtain the best-fit model, f ( t i, ). the parametric bootstrapping approach generates multiple samples from the best-fit model. we use f ( t i, ), the best fit of the model to the data to generate S synthetic datasets by assuming an error structure (e.g., Poisson or negative binomial). the S-simulated datasets are then given by f 1 ( t j, ), f 2 ( t j, ),..., f s ( t j, ), f ( t j, t j, t j 1, ) as the Poisson mean for the number of new cases observed in the t j 1 to t j interval. the solid black line corresponds to the known model solution while the red dots correspond to one simulated realization using the bootstrap approach. uncertainty around the model fit (blue lines) is given by f ( t, 1 ), f ( t, 2 ),..., f ( t, S ) where the parameter uncertainty derived from our simulation study is given by i where i = 1,2,..., S. the negative binomial distribution requires two parameters to model the mean and overdispersion in the data. so, it is possible to model variance levels in the data that are relatively higher than the mean. results are shown in Fig. 9: 1) the uncertainty of parameters \u201cr\u201d and \u201cp\u201d associated with the fit of the GGM model to the early phase of the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. a parameter is identifiable when its confidence interval lies in a finite range of values. lack of parameter identifiability can be recognized when large perturbations in the model parameters generate small changes in the model output. structural parameter non-identifiability results from the particular structure of the model independently of the characteristics of the observed time series data. parameters r = 0.2, p = 0.8, a = 1 and K = 1000 were simulated using the generalized-Richards model (GRM) using the parameter values r = 0.2, p = 0.8, a = 1 and K = 1000. Fig. 10 shows the resulting empirical distributions of the parameters using an increasing length of the growth phase: 10, 20,..., 80 days. parameters r i and p i were significantly correlated after fitting the GGM to the first 15 weeks of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. confidence intervals of these parameters display reasonable uncertainty to reliably characterize the parameters. the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of the fits provided by the GGM and EXPM models to the first 15 weeks of the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone are as follows. a long-term forecast (e.g., several years) could be useful to make strategic decisions. forecasts are often inaccurate as they are mostly based on current values and uncertainty of the parameters of the system, which are likely to change over time. a properly calibrated model to data can be used to generate short-term or long-term forecasts of the system. the blue circles denote the time series data. the vertical dashed line separates the calibration and forecasting periods. to assess forecasting performance, we can use one of the performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) previously described in Section 11. the cyan curves correspond to the uncertainty during the model calibration period. the gray curves correspond to the uncertainty in the forecast. the mean (solid red line) and 95% CIs (dashed red lines) of the model fit are also shown. the cyan curves correspond to the uncertainty during the model calibration period. the gray curves correspond to the ensemble of realizations for the model forecast. the mean (solid red line) and 95% CIs (dashed red lines) of the model fit are also shown. long-term forecasts based on the same model that was employed to generate the data. it is of interest to understand how much data is needed to faithfully calibrate a model to synthetic data derived from the same model. the model is fitted to an increasing length of the growth phase. a key epidemiological parameter to measure the transmissibility of a pathogen is the basic reproduction number, R 0. this parameter is a function of several parameters of the epidemic model including transmission rates and infectious periods of the epidemiological classes that contribute to new infections. we can fit the SEIR to the first 16\u201320 days of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francsico via least-square fitting using the Matlab built-in function lsqcurvefit.m. the initial number of cases I(0) is fixed according to the first observation day in the data (i.e., C(0) = 4) top panels show the best fit of the SEIR model and its uncertainty to the first 16, 18, and 20 days of data of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco. the blue circles correspond to 200 realizations of the epidemic curve assuming a Poisson error structure. the light blue lines correspond to 200 realizations of the epidemic curve assuming a Poisson error structure. r i, p i provides a curve of the effective reproduction number for each value of the parameters r i, p i where i = 1,2,..., S. then, we can compute the curves R t j ( r i, p i ) based on the incidence at calendar time t j denoted by I ( t j, r i, p i ). based on the generalized-growth method, we estimated the effective reproduction number at 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.1) top panels display the empirical distributions of the growth rate r, the deceleration of growth parameter p and the effective reproduction number R e f f based on fitting the GGM to the first 20 days of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco. approach to quantify parameter uncertainty, evaluate parameter identifiability, assess model performance, and generate forecasts with quantified uncertainty. this approach relies solely on case incidence series from an unfolding outbreak and allows considerations of different error structures in the case series data."}
