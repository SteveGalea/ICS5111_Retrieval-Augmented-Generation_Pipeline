{"summary": "the pulmonary artery catheter is safe, but is it useful\" since 1996, there has been a heated debate about the dangers and benefits of this monitoring intervention. the pulmonary artery catheter is safe, but is it useful\" group used a subset of low versus high positive end-expiratory pressure trial patients. for their manoeuvre they chose a 30 s sustained inflation to 35\u201340 cmH2O. the group studied 72 patients using a crossover design. researchers randomised 401 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia to receive either 8 or 15 days of optimal antibiotic therapy. there were no differences in any of the major clinical outcome measures between the groups. a short duration of high dose therapy is the optimal strategy."}
