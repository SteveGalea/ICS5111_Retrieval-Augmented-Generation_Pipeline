{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses are the most abundant viruses in nature. poliovirus (PV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) also rearrange cellular membranes into organelle-like replicative structures. coronavirus replicative structures are a family of evolutionary related +RNA viruses that belong to the order of the Nidovirales. the genome contains all the genetic information necessary to direct the synthesis of full-length genomic RNA (replication) and the production of subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) the 5' and 3' ends of the genome contain untranslated regions (UTRs) two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. the remaining 3' one-third part encodes structural proteins interspersed with sequences encoding some accessory proteins. the viral replicase is encoded by the two most 5' ORFs of the genomic RNA, ORF1a and ORF1b. translation of ORF1a and ORF1b generates two very large replicase polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab. replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are extensively processed by viral proteinases. the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-A59 genome contains a 5' cap structure and a 3' poly(A) tail. the first two-thirds of the genome consist of two large open-reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated into two large replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) the key enzyme involved in genome replication is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP; nsp12), which is present in nsp12. only the part of the polyprotein is shown that contains hydrophobic domains residing in nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6. the nsp13 protein contains a superfamily 1 helicase domain with an amino-terminal zinc-binding domain that is important for the unwinding activity of duplex RNA (and DNA) in a 5'-to-3 direction. the multifunctional nsp13 protein additionally possesses nucleotide triphosphatase activity [27,29,30]. nsp14 has metal ion-dependent 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity [35] and contains a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU; nsp15) [36], both able to degrade RNA and dsRNA. nsp14 may function as a proofreading enzyme [40] all four hydrophobic domains of nsp4 span the lipid bilayer. this is the case for only two of the three hydrophobic domains in nsp3 and six of the seven in nsp6. the cleavage between nsp3 and nsp4 appears to be a rapid event. the function of nsp2 is not yet known, although this protein was shown not to be essential for virus replication [58,59] the reader is referred to several excellent reviews on this topic for more detailed insights [10,60,61] the first two-thirds of the genome consist of two large open-reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. the final one-third of the genome contains the canonical CoV structural proteins-encoding genes (S, E, M and N), interspaced by several accessory genes (2a, HE, 4, 5a);. nsp5 contain hydrophobic domains that do not span the lipid bilayer. key enzyme involved in genome replication is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is present in nsp12. nsp12 protein is able to utilize homo- and heteropolymeric RNAs as template but its RdRp activity is dependent on primers to copy the viral RNA. nsp14 has metal ion-dependent 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity [35] and contains a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU; nsp15) [36], both able to degrade RNA and dsRNA. nsp14 may function as a proofreading enzyme [40]. nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 proteins are predicted to function as transmembrane domains. transmembrane domain predictions based on multiple alignment of 27 coV replicase polyprotein sequences revealed an uneven number of hydrophobic domains for both nsp3 and nsp6 [42,43,44,45]. the occurrence of conserved non-membrane spanning hydrophobic domains in nsp3 and nsp6 suggests an important function for these domains. the addition of palmitic acid to this hydrophobic domain may stabilize its peripheral membrane association. nsp2 is not yet known, although this protein was shown not to be essential for virus replication. the ER is the most likely membrane donor for the DMVs, despite the absence of most conventional ER markers on these structures. a higher magnification clearly demonstrates that the DMVs contain a double-lipid bilayer. coV replicative structures have been associated with viral RNA synthesis. antibodies recognizing dsRNA label the interior of the MHV-induced DMVs. newly synthesized viral RNA was observed in MHV-infected cells in close proximity to replicative structures. gi trafficking, or knockdown of its target GBF1, inhibited MHV replication while reducing the number of DMVs [67] similar results were reported for EDEMosomes [78,79], EDEMosomes [78,79], EDEMosomes [78,79] and EDEMosomes [78,79]. co-expression of nsp4 with the C-terminal one-third part of nsp3 resulted in the relocalization of these proteins from the ER into discrete foci mostly localizing to the perinuclear region of the cell. co-expression of nsp4 and nsp3C resulted in the relocalization of these proteins from the ER into discrete foci mostly localizing to the perinuclear region of the cell nsp3 and nsp4 interact via their luminal loops in such a way that their interaction prevents reconstitution of a functional Venus protein. in this model nsp3 and nsp4 interact via their luminal loops in such a way that their interaction prevents reconstitution of a functional Venus protein. mutants of cysteine residues present in the luminal loop of EAV nsp3 resulted in altered morphologies of the DMVs. the introduction of a N-glycosylation site in this loop also affected their morphology to some extent. similar membrane rearrangements can be induced by the (co-)expression of nsps. for several of these viruses similar membrane rearrangements can be induced by the (co-)expression of ns the similarities between the membrane-associated nsps of different +RNA viruses relate to their common ability to remodel membranes. the induction of membrane curvature in lipid bilayers is critical when remodeling host cellular membranes. the viral proteins may function similar to host cellular proteins known to induce membrane bending via a scaffold mechanism. the ER is the most likely membrane donor for the replicative structures. a higher magnification clearly demonstrates that the DMVs contain a double-lipid bilayer. the structures are indicated by arrowheads and the CMs by asterisks. new viral RNA was observed in MHV-infected cells in close proximity to replicative structures by immunoelectron microscopy [47,71]. only few studies have been published addressing the involvement of cellular constituents in coV replication and the generation of the replicative structures. autophagosomal protein marker microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3/Atg8) colocalized with replicative structures. LC3 was found in association with replicative structures by Zhao and coworkers. colocalization data could not be reproduced, while absence of Atg5 did not affect coV replication. co-expression of nsp4 with the C-terminal one-third part of nsp3 resulted in the relocalization of these proteins from the ER into discrete foci mostly localizing to the perinuclear region of the cell. co-expression of nsp4 with the nsp3C resulted in the relocalization of these proteins from the ER into discrete foci. nsp3 and nsp4 interact via their luminal loops in such a way that their interaction prevents reconstitution of a functional Venus protein. other studies suggest an important role for nsp4 in the generation of the replicative structures. nsps are either integral transmembrane proteins, examples being the NS4A proteins of dengue virus (88) and Kunjin virus (89) and the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus (90) the proteins are only peripherally associated to the lipid bilayer, such as the 1a protein of brome mosaic virus (91) and the 2C protein of poliovirus (92) the viral proteins may function similar to host cellular proteins known to induce membrane bending via a scaffold mechanism. these proteins may function similar to host cellular proteins known to induce membrane bending via a scaffold mechanism, as has been proposed for the small GTPase Sar1 (reviewed in [100,102]). coV-infected cells are confined to a reticulovesicular network. small structures have not yet been \u2018captured\u2019 into this network. correlative light-electron microscopy studies will be required to solve this issue. a role of the cytoskeleton in the movement of replicative structures has also been described for HCV, SFV, and PV. disruption of a functional microtubular network inhibited the movement of the small HCV and nascent PV replicative structures [108,109], concomitant with dispersal of these structures. nsp2 has to be somehow important in vivo as its coding sequence is maintained during evolution. nsp2 has to be somehow important in vivo as its coding sequence is maintained during evolution. the multifunctional N protein is involved in viral replication [121,122,123] and virion assembly [124] the newly synthesized genomic viral RNA needs to be transported from the replication sites to the assembly sites. nsp4-GFP fusion protein was detected at the ER and at replicative structures that harbor nsp4. live cell imaging studies of SFV-infected cells reveal presence of replicative structures that could be discriminated on the basis of their size and mobility. large HCV structures, probably representing membranous webs, exhibited limited movement, whereas smaller ones could travel long distances throughout the cytoplasm. a class of non-acidic highly mobile vesicles showed saltatory movements. fusion of the neutral mobile structures with the acidic mobile structures resulted in the formation of the large acidic structures. a role of the cytoskeleton in the movement of replicative structures has been described for HCV, SFV, and PV. nsp2 and nsp4 replicate-associated proteins show different diffusional mobilities when present at replicative structures. nsp2 was shown to be immobilized by using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method. nsp2 has to be somehow important in vivo as its coding sequence is maintained during evolution. the structural N protein is also important in coronavirus replication and has been detected in the perinuclear region of infected cells colocalizing with markers for the replicative structures. the interaction of the protein with nsp3 is presumably important for the initial recruitment of N to the replicative structures. the mobility of the HCV NS4B protein depends on its intracellular location. this protein is present at the ER and at membrane-associated foci (MAFs) that are induced upon expression of this protein. NS4B is an integral transmembrane protein as well. sites active in RNA synthesis are expected to contain at least three components: the RdRp, dsRNA intermediates active in replication/transcription and nascent viral RNA. newly synthesized viral RNAs were shown to colocalize with antibodies recognizing either nsp5 or the C-terminal part of pp1a. a new method was used to detect and visualize newly synthesized coronaviral RNA by incorporation of an alkyne different models can be put forward to explain these observations. in one model, DMVs function as the sites of active RNA synthesis. at the later times in infection, many DMVs are no longer active, while the ones that are active may contain only little dsRNA. the inner content of the replicative structures/RTCs is connected to the cytoplasm via a pore [129,130], indicating that these DMVs are actually spherule-like invaginations (once) active in RNA synthesis. replicative structures/RTCs are macromolecular assemblies, which are engaged in a plethora of protein-protein, protein-RNA, and protein-lipid interactions. reticulons, which form a family of ER membrane-shaping proteins, were implicated in the formation of ER membrane curvature. reticulons appear to be required by BMV for determining the size of the spherules. other proteins playing a role in shaping and remodeling of the ER are the atlastins and CLIMP-63 [133,136] photoactivatable fluorescent proteins can be used to investigate the formation of replicative structures in real-time by \u2018optical pulse-labeling\u2019 in living cells. tagging of viral RNA by genetic incorporation of specific RNA sequences that bind fluorescently-tagged RNA-binding proteins can be studied. tagging of viral RNA by genetic incorporation of specific RNA sequences that bind fluorescently-tagged RNA-binding proteins [147,148], hybridization of fluorescent \u2018mole ]"}
