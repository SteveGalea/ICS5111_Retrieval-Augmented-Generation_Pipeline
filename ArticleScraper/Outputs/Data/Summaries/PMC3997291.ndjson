{"summary": "rats of diverse ages were used to mold and cast a broad spectrum of tumor sizes. the effect of age as a potential confounder was controlled whenever possible. rats were housed in single-sex groups of 2 or 3 rats per standard caging. a rat was tized with 3% isoflurane and placed ventral side down on a sterile surgical field above a heating pad to maintain a consistent body temperature during the procedure. a video from the proximal to distal colon was recorded, and a still image of each tumor was acquired by using a Hopkins 0\u00b0 1.9-mm endoscope (catalog no. 1232AA), Karl Storz. alginate was pushed through the filling tube while it was slowly withdrawn from the colon. a paper towel was held over the anus to ensure no alginate leaked out. each mold was rinsed of fecal material and stored in a conical tube until dental stone casts could be made. yellow dental stone (2.5 g; The Plaster Guys, Glenside, PA) then was added to a small beaker containing 1.0 mL deionized water and mixed completely. a small scoopula was used to fill the impressions in the alginate mold, with care to avoid bubbles and completely fill the impression. casts were placed in a 90 \u00b0C hybridization oven for 48 h before being weighed. four pegs each containing a cylindrical hole were filled with dental stone and dried for various periods of time. the volume of the pegs and dry weight of the dental stone was used to determine the conversion factor (1.3236 gm/cm3) 0.05 or less was considered significant. the weight of the dental stone casts correlated with the weight of the dissected tumors. both male and female rats were used to mold and cast a broad spectrum of tumor sizes. rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and placed ventral side down on a sterile surgical field above a heating pad to maintain a consistent body temperature during the procedure. the colon was flushed with 37 \u00b0C PBS (catalog no. 14190, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to remove any fecal material and to lubricate the colon. alginate was pushed through the filling tube while it was slowly withdrawn from the colon. a paper towel was held over the anus to ensure no alginate leaked out before it solidified. each mold was rinsed of fecal material and stored in a conical tube. the alginate molds were removed from storage and the tumor impressions gently dried by using laboratory tissues (KimWipes, Kimberly-Clark, Irving, TX) yellow dental stone (2.5 g; The Plaster Guys, Glenside, PA) then was added to a small beaker containing 1.0 mL deionized water and mixed completely. a conversion factor was determined from the initial volume of a peg hole and weight of its dry cast. the weight of each dental stone cast was divided by the average conversion factor. a 2-sided Wilco test was used to test for a difference between 2 groups. xon rank-sum test was used to test for a correlation between 2 variables, such as error rate and tumor size. a 2-sided Kendall rank-correlation test was used to test for a correlation between 2 variables, such as error rate and tumor size. the mean error of the alginate molding procedure during the first half was not statistically significant (P = 0.42) by a 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. however, the standard deviation from the mean was greater in the first half (17.2% 14.5%) compared with the second half (18.4% 8.8%). a total of 21 rats underwent the alginate molding procedure. tumor weights ranged from 0.008 to 0.137 g (corresponding to tumor volumes of about 6 to 104 mm3) from 16 rats, a total of 50 tumors were cast and directly weighed, 40 of which had both wet and dry weights determined. over a 5-wk period, 3 tumors grew (tumors 1, 2, and 3), one was static (tumor 5), and one regressed (tumor 4). this method has proven highly successful for determining in vivo tumor volume. but it was essential to explore whether the procedure had any overt effect on tumor growth or multiplicity in longitudinal studies. alginate molding coupled with dental stone casting has successfully measured tumor sizes (4 to 196 mm3) weight of dental stone casts made from tumors correlated highly with the weight of the dissected tumor (R2 = 0.93) alginate does not have an overt effect on tumor growth profiles. however, the potential for effects at the molecular or cellular level should be investigated further. alginate molding may hold potential for determining accurate tumor volume measurements in the mouse colon. the rat has recently made dramatic strides in this area and for biologic reasons is an increasingly preferred choice to model human disease. rat models have accelerated the study of colonic neoplasia in experimental animals. alginate molding combined with dental stone casting is a simple and reliable method to determine tumor volume in vivo without the need for expensive equipment and software."}
