{"summary": "global more than 212 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratoryconfirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009. the southern hemisphere also witnessed a sizable epidemic of pH1N1 in its winter season during May\u2013August. it is important to monitor changes in antigenicity, severity, transmissibility, and antiviral resistance in the southern hemisphere to compare with those of the spring and winter outbreaks. the solution of the Richards model can be explicitly given in terms of its model parameters and the initial value C(0) as. the parameter t m is related to the turning point ti, defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing. the turning point ti can be easily pinpointed by locating the inflection point of the cumulative case curve. this quantity in time has obvious epidemiologic importance, indicating either the beginning of a new wave of infections (i.e., moment of acceleration after acceleration) or the end of the current wave of infections (i.e., moment of acceleration after acceleration after acceleration) no mass intervention measures (e.g., community level isolation/quarantine/closure) were implemented at any time during the course of the outbreaks, although some measures were taken in each country with varying degrees of impact. we will henceforth denote the reproduction number obtained here as the effective reproduction number R of the outbreak in question. ln denotes the natural logarithm function by fitting cumulative case data of a particular outbreak. the basic reproduction number is given by the formula, where T is the disease generation time (or generation interval) defined as the average time interval from one person being infected to the time when an infection by this infected individual occur. a variation of the Sshaped Richards model has been proposed, 14 which distinguishes between two types of turning points. one in the initial S curve signifies the first turning point that ends initial exponential growth (or a downturn in case number) and another in the epidemic curve where the growth rate of the number of cumulative cases begin to increase again (or a downturn in case number) the countrywise results of model parameter estimation, using least squares techniques, are detailed in the following text. for the purpose of computing R0, we make use of the mean estimated generation interval (and its 95% CI) of T = 191 days (95% CI: 130\u2013271) as given in, 18 which was estimated from early Mexico novel

Estimates of effective reproduction number R for new Zealand data using estimates of T obtained from pH1N1 data of: US with (a) T = (26, 32) 19 and (b) T = 25 20. reproduction numbers are in close agreement with estimates by the WHO informal mathematical modeling network for 2009 influenza pandemic. the results indicate that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R, as can be expected from the formula for R given earlier. the results indicate that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R. imported cases account for more than 10% of total cases. a few imported cases at the early stages that set off a fastspreading disease locally (e.g., pandemic influenza) would have a decidedly different effect when compared to the situation with imported cases scattered over a long period of time for a less transmissible disease. turning point For argentina and brazil, two earlier turning points were detected through the 2wave model. the single turning point of the respective 2wave models is in agreement with the single turning point of the respective 1wave models, both detect eweek 31. the Richards model has the advantage of isolating a small range of time period during which the turning points (up turns and down turns) may have occurred. the limitations of the Richards model have been thoroughly discussed previously in, 14, 16 and hence are not repeated here. the resulting estimate for reproduction number is surprisingly similar to those of cases and deaths. most of the southern hemisphere countries studied are of substantial size. the epidemic had different timings in different regions. the results show that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R, as can be expected from the formula for R given earlier. the results indicate that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R, as can be expected from the formula for R given earlier. the role of imported cases is problematic to quantitate when estimating transmissibility. by ignoring imported cases, one ignores the infections caused by the imported infective and hence overestimates the transmissibility of the remaining local cases. there are several factors relating to imported cases that might impact the estimation of R. higher R for earlier data was also observed in, 22 after correction for ascertainment bias. it is particularly interesting to note that for countries such as argentina, Chile, new Zealand, and australia, the estimates of R are highly comparable. turning points for reporting of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths fall on the same eweek. this gives further credence to the detection of turning points of an outbreak, not only for disease incidence but also for temporal changes in disease progression and treatment. several sophisticated models have been proposed (e.g., 27, 28, 29, 30) that give timedependent reproduction number R, which could change with time owing to interventions and/or susceptible depletion. however, the Richards model provides a swift and viable method to quick estimate of R as well as identifying the important turning points of the outbreak. the current strain, while circulating around the globe, has not become more severe or transmissible either in the southern or in the northern hemisphere. the results, which corroborate earlier findings that the 2009 pandemic had not been severe in the southern hemisphere, will be useful for global preparedness planning.
