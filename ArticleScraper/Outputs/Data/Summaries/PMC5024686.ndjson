{"summary": "we constructed a BC-STAR-PROM library containing thousands of expression vectors. the approach is based on the high frequency of TF-binding sites in random synthetic DNA. the association of promoters\u2019 activities with barcodes in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding reporter mRNAs. cDNA barcode regions were amplified using cDNA-specific primers. barcode amplicons of an entire experiment were pooled, gel-purified, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq lane using the rapid mode. STAR-PROM approach looked at TFs activated by drugs engendering actin and tubulin cytoskeletal perturbations. the polymerization state of the actin cytoskeleton in the liver and other tissues undergoes dramatic daily fluctuations. if successful, our novel strategy should reveal several hits for SRF\u2013MRTF after inducing actin polymerization. 106 sequence reads were demultiplexed and trimmed to isolate the 20-nt barcodes. the data produced in these experiments represent a functional screening of >400,000 bp of random DNA (3065 68mers, both DNA strands) analysis of the BC-STAR-PROM results Barcode counts from samples of the same experiment were normalized to a median value. fold changes were ranked according to the ratio between the mean fold change of the drug-treated samples divided by the mean fold change of the controls. the bottom panel depicts a magnification of the 100 top-ranked barcodes. the 20 strongest promoter responses to jasplakinolide or vinblastine obtained from two biological replicates were merged. promoters were cloned into a different vector without the barcode sequence. the resulting plasmids were individually transfected into U2OS cells. the bioluminescence recordings after drug treatment faithfully reflected the barcode counts. promoters that were induced strongly only by jasplakinolide with an immediate early group 2: (1092-2778) or somewhat delayed (group 3: 528-4110) response, and promoters that responded to both drugs with less rapid kinetics (group 4: 1933-1704). 105,791 potential matches for binding motifs covered 93% of 2110 motifs described in the transfac 2012 database. individual STAR-PROM clones were cotransfected into U2OS cells with siRNAs targeting the TFs putatively binding to the respective promoters. individual real-time bioluminescence recordings are shown for one representative clone of each group of promoters. promoter sequences in group 1 share an SRF-binding motif termed CArG box [CC(A/T)6GG] and showed a strong and immediate response to both jasplakinolide and vinblastine (bottom panel) we monitored the activity of each individual promoter in U2OS cells depleted for SRF or for MRTF-A + MRTF-B. the second group of promoters responded more vigorously to jasplakinolide than to vinblastine. the fold change of induction was already low for jasplakinolide. however, plasmid 2778 displayed a strong response to jasplakinolide (30-fold) but not to vinblastine. the response to both drugs was abrogated after siRNA-mediated NFkB1 depletion. knocking down MRTF-A + B, but not SRF, also blunted the induction by jasplakinolide. the involved mechanisms are not yet fully understood. the knockdown of FOS did not affect the response of plasmid 1099 to jasplakinolide, suggesting that another TF participated in the induction process. however, both the fold change and the kinetics of the responses to jasplakinolide were different, indicating that these drugs elicited different mechanisms. action of vinblastine and jasplakinolide suggests no cross-talk was required for activation of TF complexes containing FOS. BC-STAR-PROM also allowed the ranking of the induced TFs in terms of kinetics and fold changes of their responses. plasmid 2961 showed a burst of activation in between two cytokinesis events. this indicated that promoter 2961 was stimulated by cell-autonomous mechanisms during the cell division cycle. to record a larger number of cells, we used a stable NIH3T3 cell line (dubbed 41-3t3) expressing a single copy of a luciferase transgene driven by a synthetic promoter harboring eight 84-bp tandem 41-3T3 transfected with siRNAs against MRTF-A + B showed almost no response to serum induction during the first 16 h. the cumulative number of cells expressing luciferase in dividing cells per frame for 15 min was reduced by eightfold. cell counting performed in parallel revealed that the MRTF-A + B double knockdown had only a modest anti-proliferative effect. 100 cells were plotted from one cell division cycle (cytokinesis to cytokinesis) the luciferase signals are depicted in red. the traces were recorded 16 h after plating the cells to avoid the serum effect from the medium change. two sequencing strategies were used to associate the barcodes with the corresponding promoter repeats. we thus counted 2894 promoters that were associated with 3237 barcodes. the association of some promoters with multiple barcodes served as a quality control. barcoded primers were used to amplify a luciferase fragment that was cloned into the STAR-PROM library. cells were transfected with the entire plasmid library containing >3000 BC-STAR-PROM plasmids. forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with the respective drugs. bioluminescence was recorded using a lumicycler to assess relative transfection efficiencies. dishes with similar luciferase expression were selected for further experiments. time series (0\u20138 h after treatment) were established by preparing RNAs from cells treated with either the drugs or DMSO. for each barcode, the relative expression at each time point (fold change) was calculated by dividing the read count by the average of the controls. when ranked on their relative expression, most barcode counts were not influenced by the drug treatments. DMSO time points were reduced to 0, 1, 2, and 8 h in the second replicate (1). individual STAR-PROM clones were transfected into U2OS cells. bioluminescence curves were ordered following the clustering defined in B. some promoters were induced by both jasplakinolide and vinblastine. among these plasmids, three carried a different barcode but shared the same promoter sequence. bioluminescence was monitored in real time. we identified 105,791 potential matches for binding motifs. 93% of the 2110 motifs described in the transfac 2012 database. we first developed a systematic analysis of promoter sets to determine which motifs were primarily enriched in the induced promoter. individual real-time bioluminescence recordings are shown for one representative clone of each group of promoters. the responses of the transfected cells to 0.1% DMSO, 200 nM jasplakinolide (Jasp) or 100 nM vinblastine (Vb) treatments were tested. siRNAs against both SRF and MRTFs abrogated the response of these plasmids to jasplakinolide and vinblastine. we pretreated cells for 2 h before vinblastine treatment with latrunculin B to destabilize actin filaments. paclitaxel did not abolish the stimulatory effect of jasplakinolide. jasplakinolide depletion and MRTF-A + MRTF-B depletion attenuated the response to jasplakinolide dramatically. the failure of plasmid 2778 to respond to vinblastine would be that its promoter sequence also contains a motif for a vinblastine-induced repressor, preventing SRF activation. MRTF-A + B, but not SRF, also blunted the induction by jasplakinolide. promoter 4110 contains binding motifs for NFkB and AP-1. this may explain the different response kinetics of this promoter to the drug. the knockdown of FOS did not affect the response of plasmid 1099 to jasplakinolide, suggesting that another TF participated in the induction process. c-Fos transcription is driven by SRF\u2013TCF rather than SRF\u2013MRTF complexes. however, both the fold change and the kinetics of the responses were different. the SRF\u2013MRTF pathway is endogenously activated during the cell cycle Cytoskeletal drug studies with BC-STAR-PROM emphasized that SRF is a central regulator in the immediate early response to actin polymerization and tubulin depolymerization. intriguingly, such changes in cytoskeleton dynamics also occur during cell cycle progression. individual cells were monitored by real-time bioluminescence imaging during 78 h. as indicated by its name, SRF is induced by serum. we therefore had to eliminate serum-confounding effects triggered by exposing the cells to new medium. cells were seeded in 3.5-cm dishes with white DMEM containing 20% FBS. recording was initiated 1 h after seeding. traces were recorded 16 h after plating cells to avoid serum effect. the first frame was used to estimate the starting number of cells in the movies (T0) the histograms show the cumulative counts of luminescent cells measured in movies for the first 64 frames (16 h of serum response) and the period from frame 65 to 310 (16\u201378 h of cell cycle-dependent SRF activation). a very rapid induction is likely to reflect an immediate early response. a delayed induction favors a scenario in which the TF of interest has to be synthesized before it can elicit the response. the screen could be adapted to the identification of any TF responding to a signal of interest. YAP, a coactivator of TEAD in the Hippo signaling pathway, is activated by jasplakinolide. however, our BC-STAR-PROM performed in U2OS did not reveal TEAD-binding sites as cis-acting elements conferring a potent induction by jasplakinolide. endogenous activation of the MRTF\u2013SRF pathway during cell cycle SRF was the only TF responding to both polymerization of actin and depolymerization of microtubules through the same pathway. cross-talk between actin and tubulin dynamics is known to occur during the cell division cycle. BC-STAR-PROM is a powerful and unbiased methodology to identify signal-responsive TFs. it allows the identification of cis-acting elements for TFs responding to any stimulus of interest. a major virtue of this method is its ability to identify signal-responsive TFs. a very rapid induction is likely to reflect an immediate early response, depending on a TF already present in an inactive form in the noninduced state. a delayed induction favors a scenario in which the TF of interest has to be synthesized before it can elicit the response. BC-STAR-PROM did not reveal YAP as an actin polymerization-sensitive factor. but our BC-STAR-PROM performed in U2OS did not reveal TEAD-binding sites as cis-acting elements conferring a potent induction by jasplakinolide. endogenous activation of the MRTF\u2013SRF pathway during cell cycle SRF was the only TF responding to both polymerization of actin and depolymerization of microtubules through the same pathway. cross-talk between actin and tubulin dynamics is known to occur during the cell division cycle. kov et al. 2013 demonstrated that BC-STAR-PROM is a powerful and unbiased methodology to identify signal-responsive TFs. kov et al. 2013 demonstrated that BC-STAR-PROM is a powerful and unbiased methodology to identify signal-responsive TFs. knockdown experiments in the 41-3T3 cell line were performed using 60 pmol of siRNA targeting SRF (siGENOME SMART pool Dharmacon), MRTF-A (GGGCUCUGCCCAUGCUUUU) (Sigma Aldrich), MRTF-B (GAAGAGCCUUCUCCAAUUU) (Sigma Aldrich), or siRNA nontargeting control (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) according to manufacturer's pMC-STAR-PROM-Luc library A 524-bp insert was cloned into the speI site of the pMC-Luc vector. mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. all STAR-PROM colonies were pooled with a cell scraper. pMC-STAR-PROM-Luc library was obtained by insertion of a barcoded luciferase insert (HindIII\u2013XbaI fragment from pMC-Luc vector) the barcoded inserts were amplified by PCR from the pMC-Luc vector using the primer 5\u2032-GACGTGAATTCGAGCTAGCTTCGAAT-3\u2032 and the barcode-containing primer 5\u2032-GGCAGTCTAGCTTCGAAT-3\u2032. two sequencing methods were used to assign barcodes to promoter sequences. the initial NheI\u2013XbaI fragments of 2.3 kb were ligated to hairpin adapters. DNA fragments spanning the barcode/promoter junction were PCR-amplified. the PCR products were diluted 1:100 in 10 mM Tris (pH 8) and Illumina sequence tails were introduced by a second PCR with primers 44 forward and 45 reverse. RNA preparation RNA was dissolved and precipitated in 2.5 M LiCl overnight at 20\u00b0C. cDNA was amplified in eight 250-ng RT-qPCR reactions. the forward primers had a 6-nt index tail specific for every sample. amplicons of samples from a single experiment were pooled together and used as templates for a third PCR reaction that introduced the Illumina sequencing tails. the final amplicons were gel-purified on a 2% agarose gel (using Qiagen spin columns), concentrated by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.250 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) barcode counts of different experiments were joined in a single table, normalized on the median, and expressed as fold changes with regard to the average read counts of controls. fold changes were ranked according to the average of the time series (sum of reads at 1, 2, 4, 8 h divided by 4 for both drug- and DMSO-treated samples) a reverse primer matching the barcode region was annealed to each library. the reaction was incubated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C (denaturation) and 10 min at 60\u00b0C (annealing and extension) the beads were washed three times for 10 min in 500 L of buffer A + 0.5% SDS. bioluminescence time-lapse microscopy was performed using an EM-CCD camera. cells were plated in -Dishes 35 mm high, ibiTreat (81156 from Ibidi) at a low density. time-lapse bioluminescence microscopy was performed using an EM-CCD camera. traces between two cell divisions were imported on the bioluminescence images. the luciferase signals were measured as intensity counts. traces between two cell divisions were measured as intensity counts. knockdown experiments in the 41-3T3 cell line were performed using 60 pmol of siRNA targeting SRF (siGENOME SMART pool Dharmacon), MRTF-A (GGGCUCUGCCCAUGCUUUU) (Sigma Aldrich), MRTF-B (GAAGAGCCUUCUCUCCAAUUU) (Sigma Aldrich), or siRNA nontargeting control (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) according to manufacturer' mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. pMC-STAR-PROM-Luc library A 524-bp insert was cloned into the dephosphorylated NheI and HindIII sites of the pMC-Luc vector. all STAR-PROM colonies were pooled with a cell scraper. a barcoded luciferase insert was inserted between the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pMC-STAR-PROM-Luc library. the barcoded inserts were amplified by PCR from the pMC-Luc vector using the primer 5\u2032-GACGTGAATTCGAGCTTCGAAT-3\u2032. in the 20-nt barcode region, only 3 nt (H, D, V, and B) were allowed at each pMC-STAR-PROM-Luc library A 524-bp insert was cloned into the dephosphorylated NheI and XbaI sites of the pMC-Luc vector. the inserts, spanning 6 tandem repeats of random 68mers flanked by 8 bp of defined sequences on both ends, were obtained. all STAR-PROM colonies were pooled with a cell scraper. 200 g of plasmid DNA was extracted by standard alkaline lysis. barcoded inserts were amplified by PCR from pMC-Luc vector. 5000 colonies distributed on six plates. a 2275-bp NheI\u2013XbaI fragment was gel-purified on a 1% agarose gel. precipitated circles were washed with 75% ethanol, resuspended in 30 L of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) the three digestions were heat-inactivated for 15 min at 70\u00b0C and pooled. the independent digestion with three different restriction endonucleases reduced the possibility of cleaving the DNA regions encompassing the promoter and/or barcode regions. cells were transfected with 2 g of the BC-STAR-PROM library using 5 L of Xtremegene 9.0 (Roche) 12 hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h. cDNA was amplified in eight 250-ng RT-qPCR reactions. the forward primers had a 6-nt index tail specific for every sample (i.e., time point, drug, or DMSO) to recognize the origin of the sample in multiplexed sequencing reactions. at least three sequencing errors are required to convert an index into another one. raw FastQ files were assessed by FastQC (version 0.11.2) bioinformatics analysis The output of the sequencing machine was a large text file that contains the reads of a 100-nt barcoded luciferase fragment coming from all of the pooled experimental samples. for each sample, the barcode region was isolated, and the number of barcodes was counted. fold changes The read count table was downloaded from Galaxy and imported into R Studio. an R script is available on GitHub (https://github.com/randogp/STARprom). a reverse primer matching the barcode region was annealed to each library in a 25-L reaction. the reaction was incubated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C (denaturation) and 10 min at 60\u00b0C (annealing and extension) beads were washed three times for 10 min in 500 L of buffer A + 0.5% SDS, three times in buffer A, and once in Taq buffer. amplified DNAs were digested with HindIII and NheI, and the promoter fragments were gel-purified. bright-field images (512 512 pixels, 8-bit stacks) were corrected for uneven illumination by subtracting the background estimated with a median matrix of 8 pixels. a maximum matrix of 1 pixel was subsequently applied to facilitate cell tracking. cells were tracked using the semiautomated CGE plug-in (Sage et al. 2010)."}
