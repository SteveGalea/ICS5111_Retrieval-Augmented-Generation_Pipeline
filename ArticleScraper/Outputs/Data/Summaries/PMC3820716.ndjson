{"summary": "microRNAs are an extensive family of small regulatory RNAs that function by binding to complementary mRNAs. they are initially transcribed as long pri-miRNAs, which are sequentially processed by the RNase III enzymes Drosha, in the nucleus, and Dicer, in the cytoplasm, to generate the mature, 22-nt miRNA. complementarity to nucleotides 2 through 8 of the miRNA, the so-called seed region, is particularly important viruses that infect multiple cell types need a way to avoid inhibition by a wide range of miRNAs with distinct mRNA-targeting specificities. adeno and polyoma viruses can also benefit from cellular miRNA species, with the exception of the retrovirus bovine leukemia virus (HCV), which requires miR-122 for replication. infected cells generally contain normal levels of miRNAs, and most viruses can be inhibited by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which function indistinguishably from miRNAs in mammalian cells [16], or by insertion of target sites for endogenous cellular miRNAs into viral transcripts [17]\u2013[20]. despite early reports to the contrary, viruses evolve to avoid 3\u2032UTR targets complementary to cellular miRNAs. mRNAs with very short 3\u2032UTRs would be expected to be relatively refractory to miRNA-mediated inhibition. some viruses, especially retroviruses, alphaviruses, and coronaviruses, contain extensive 3\u2032UTRs in at least some viral mRNA species. some viruses, especially retroviruses, contain extensive 3\u2032UTRs in at least some viral mRNA species. a technology called photo-activatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) involves pulsing cells with the highly photoactivatable uridine analog 4-thiouridine and then crosslinking endogenous RNAs to bound proteins by irradiation at 365 nm. the RISC binding sites are then comprehensively identified by deep sequencing of these small RNAs to generate sequence clusters that can viral mRNAs are 50-fold less likely to bind RISC than cellular mRNAs. this is consistent with the idea that cellular mRNAs have evolved to avoid cellular miRNAs by adopting RNA secondary structures that preclude RISC binding. current data suggest that viruses have likely evolved strategies to avoid inhibition by these ubiquitous cellular regulatory RNAs."}
