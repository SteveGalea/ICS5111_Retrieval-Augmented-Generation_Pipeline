{"summary": "influenza H17 and H18 viruses originated from bats, the waterfowl are known as a primordial reservoir for all subtypes of IAV. different subtypes of H5Nx HPAI viruses pose a substantial threat to global health with high mortality rate and huge economic burden. the clade 2.3.2.1 of H5N1 HPAI virus was first identified in 2004. since then other subclades, including 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.2.1b, and 2.3.2.1c, have evolved. rapid and highly accurate methods are necessary for the detection and control of the IAV outbreaks. Reference Viruses and Field Samples Collection A total of 15 reference influenza virus samples were obtained from the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) and National Vietnam University of Agriculture. all the reference influenza viruses were propagated in the allantoic fluid of 9\u201311 days old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. the following primers and probes were used: HA forward primer, CCAGCCAATGACCTYTGT; HA reverse primer, GRTAAGCCAYACCACATTTC; Pan H5-HPAI probe, Texas red-TGARGAAYTGAAACACCTATTGAGCAG-BHQ2. all amplicons obtained using one set of HA primers were 201 base pairs in length. one-step multiplex RT-qPCR analysis was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Hilden, Germany) the one-step multiplex RT-qPCR reaction mixture contained 0.8 L of enzyme mixture, 4 L of 5 reaction buffer, 0.8 L of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (10 pmol) from a Qiagen kit. equine influenza virus (H3N8 subtype), 1 canine influenza virus (H3N2), 1 swine influenza virus (H3N2), avian infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, human Coronavirus-229E, and human Parainfluenza were assessed using one-step multiplex RT-qPCR described in this study. all H5 HPAI experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 3 containment facility in KRIBB and biosafety level 2 plus facilities. field samples from 12 farms in Vietnam were taken from domestic chickens with signs of respiratory illness in 2016 to 2018. one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assays were performed using a serial 10-fold dilution (5 108 to 5 100 copies of plasmid DNA/L) each plasmid was cloned using the Mighty TA cloning kit. the one-step multiplex RT-qPCR reaction mixture contained 0.8 L of enzyme mixture. the PCR thermocycling procedure was performed at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. the next step was performed at 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, 56 \u00b0C for 20 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s for 40 cycles. fluorescence data were acquired during the annealing step to distinguish positive and negative results. specific amplicons were purified from 1.5% agarose gels using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Hilden, Germany) and sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Sequencer. all H5 HPAI-positive field viruses were classified as the H5 HPAI clade using Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Clade classification tool. the detection limit under both conditions was 5 101 copies per microliter. the cut-off for the cycle threshold of RT-qPCR was set to 35. each concentration had triple replicates and the mean and SD were conducted using GraphPad Prism software. strains of different subtypes or clades of influenza A virus, as well as other avian or human origin viruses, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, coronavirus-229E strain and parainfluenza virus 1 were tested.
