{"summary": "the differences between the two groups have been established through the use of serological assays. most of the arenaviruses cause persistent infection in rodents without any symptoms, and humans acquire a variety of diseases when zoonotically infected. infected individuals develop fever, retrosternal pain, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria, and mucosal bleeding. neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. a number of arenavirus species have been recently discovered. more than twenty cases of Lassa fever have been reported outside of the endemic region in areas such as the USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan. arenaviruses are classified as biosafety level (BSL)-4 pathogens, making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in laboratories without BSL-4 facilities. progress in the RT-PCR method covering genetic variations of the hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) has also been reported. antibodies against these viruses can be detected by the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), or IgG- and IgM-ELISA. recombinant protein technology could meet the demand for a simple and reliable VHF test system. recombinant NP (rNP) has been shown to be useful for serological surveys of IgM- and IgG antibodies against arenaviruses. most of the arenavirus rNPs expressed in insect cells using the recombinant baculoviruses are crystallized [56]. purified rNPs were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the expression and purification efficiency of arenavirus rNPs were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. recombinant baculoviruses allow the delivery of rNP antigens without using infectious live arenaviruses. rabbit anti-sera against LASV-NP and LCMV-NP show a negative reaction to the JUNV-rNP. antibody against old world arenavirus NP may cross-react with the old world arenavirus NP. antibody against old world arenavirus NP may not be able to react with pathogenic new world arenavirus rNPs. -12 is considered to be a broadly reactive MAb against New World arenaviruses. MAb 4A5 cross-reacts with the Mopeia virus but not with the LCMV rNP. MAb 6C11 does not cross-react with LCMV rNP. antibody Detection IFA An IFA using virus-infected cells is a common antibody test for VHF viruses. mammalian cells expressing recombinant rNP have been developed. the procedure involves transfecting HeLa cells with a mammalian cell expression vector. recombinant baculoviruses express full-length rNP of arenaviruses. most of the arenavirus rNPs expressed in insect cells are crystallized [56] and are solubilized in PBS containing 2M urea. control antigen is produced from Tn5 cells infected with baculovirus lacking polyhedrin gene (P) in the same manner as the arenavirus rNPs. the expression and purification efficiency of arenavirus rNP were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) purified rNP antigens with approximate molecular weights of 62 kDa from Luna, LCM, Lassa, Lujo, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabia, and Chapare viruses are shown. anti-serum reactivity for rNPs of different arenaviruses in IgG ELISAs. MAb C11-12 reacts at the same level with the rNPs of all of the pathogenic New World arenaviruses, including JUNV, GTOV, MACV, SABV, and CHPV. MAb 4A5 cross-reacts with LCMV rNP, while MAb 2-11 does not cross-react with LCMV rNP [51]. it is important to evaluate whether rNP-based ELISA is useful for the diagnosis of human VHF cases. the specificity of the LASV-rNP-based IgG ELISA has been confirmed by using sera obtained from Lassa fever patients. mammalian cells expressing recombinant rNP have been developed [51,57,64,65,66,67,68] to avoid the use of highly pathogenic viruses for the antigen preparation. procedure involves transfecting HeLa cells with a mammalian cell expression vector inserted with the cloned NP cDNA. sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA is comparable to that of RT-PCR for several virus-mediated infectious diseases, including Lassa fever and filovirus hemorrhagic fever. sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA is comparable to that of RT-PCR for several virus-mediated infectious diseases. the Ag-capture ELISA using MAb 4A5 has been confirmed to be useful in the detection of authentic LASV antigen in sera serially collected from hamsters infected with LASV [51] sensitivity of the MAb 4A5-based Ag-capture ELISA was similar to that of conventional RT-PCR, suggesting that the Ag-capture ELISA can be efficiently used in the diagnosis of Lassa fever. the most direct method for detection of neutralizing antibodies against HFVs is by plaque reduction neutralization tests using infectious viruses. for many HFVs, replication-incompetent pseudotyped virus particles bearing viral envelope protein (GP) have been shown to mimic the respective HFV infections, thus neutralization assays using the pseudotypes may be advantageous in some laboratory settings. a high-throughput assay for determining neutralizing antibody titers has been developed. a control pseudotype (VSV-VSV-G) expressed luciferase was incubated with serially diluted serum. the luciferase activity (%) of each well compared to the negative control (no serum) is shown. the accuracy of the results of the neutralization assays has been confirmed by comparison with the results of the neutralization assay using live Junin virus. the results of the neutralization assay have been confirmed by comparison with the results of the live Junin virus GP. serologic diagnostic methods for VHFs most often employ an ELISA, IFA, and/or virus neutralization assay. ELISAs and IFAs using rNPs as antigens are useful for detection of antibodies induced in the patients\u2019 sera."}
