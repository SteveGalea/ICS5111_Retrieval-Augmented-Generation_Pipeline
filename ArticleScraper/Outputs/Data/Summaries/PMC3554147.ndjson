{"summary": "eric liu: we are not convinced that their analysis of a limited number of RNA viruses leads to compelling conclusions without a comprehensive study that should include proper statistical tests. liu: we are unaware of a comprehensive analysis of the host-virus combinations from all three domains of life; we believe this would be a worthwhile endeavor. philic bacteria more closely resembles that of thermophilic archaea (17, 19) philic bacteria more closely resembles that of thermophilic archaea than mesophilic bacteria (17, 19). RNA viral genomes we detected replicate in archaeal hosts residing in sampled Yellowstone hot springs."}
