{"summary": "five hepatotropic viruses \u2013 named hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses \u2013 target liver cells in humans and cause acute and chronic hepatitis. other viruses such as the adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus occasionally cause symptoms of hepatitis. hepatitis A virus (HAV) is thought to associate with a cell-surface protein receptor, HAVcr-1/TIM-1 (Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1/T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1), by which it gains entry into host cells. post-entry, translation of the positive-sense RNA genome by the host ribosomal machinery, results in the production of a large viral polyprotein. entry of hepatitis C virus into target host cells is a multistep event. the cellular receptors and surface molecules involved in this process include the lectins liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin. viral ORF3 encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking process. the viral ORF3 encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking process. the virus travels to the nucleus, where the DNA genome is released into the nucleus. transcripts encoding surface antigens (subgenomic) are also produced. both pre- and subgenomic transcrpits are transferred to the cytosol. surface protein synthesis occurs in the ER. hepatitis A virus (HAV) is thought to associate with a cell-surface protein receptor, HAVcr-1/TIM-1 (Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1/T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1), by which it gains entry into host cells. post-entry, translation of the positive-sense RNA genome by the host ribosomal machinery, results in the production of a large viral polyprotein. cellular receptors and surface molecules involved in this process include the lectins liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN) and dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), claudins 6 and 9 and CD-81.12\u201314 Binding to cellular receptor viral ORF3 encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking process. the virus travels to the nuclear pore complex, where the DNA genome is released into the nucleus. transcripts encoding the surface antigens (subgenomic) are also produced. surface protein synthesis, to generate core and subviral particles, occurs in the ER. translation products of pregenomic RNA associate with protein kinases (PKs),26,27 HSPs27,28 and pregenomic RNA to yield mature core particles. a combination therapy of ribavirin and peg-IFN- (pegylated interferon) was the accepted treatment regimen for chronic cases of HCV infection up until 2011. however, achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR) was observed to vary between genotypes and populations. since 2011, the following DAAs have been approved which can be used either independently or in combination with Peg-IFN- and/or ribavirin. this treatment regimen comes with its own set of disadvantages, including significant side-effects and not being cost-effective in cases with advanced fibrosis. the next step usually involves monotherapy with ribavirin for an initial period of 90 days. however, due to its many side-effects and complications in solid organ transplantation recipient patients, it is not preferred. significant differences exist in the severity of complications caused by HEV infection in diverse endemic populations. telbivudine, adefovir and telbivudine are only prescribed when the more potent drugs are not appropriate or not available. these drugs either have a low barrier to resistance (telbivudine), are less efficacious (adefovir) or have been shown to develop resistance over long-term usage (lamivudine) a combination of adefovir and/or lamivudine with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) has been found to be effective. an effective vaccine against HBV exists and is administered 3\u20134 times over a 6 month period. there are no commercially available vaccines against HDV. inhibitors in current use against viral polymerases can be classified as (a) NAs and (b) non-NA polymerase inhibitors. they are used in the treatment of several viral diseases and are one of the first class of inhibitors identified. four different classes of non-NA polymerase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of HCV genotype 1. the nomenclature is based on the structural organization of the HCV NS5B. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) belongs to a ubiquitous, host-encoded protein family (peptidyl-prolyl cis/transisomerases) which helps in folding and trafficking of other host proteins. both drugs are derivatives of the original immunosuppressive drugs sanglifehrin A and cyclosporine A. derivatives of LJ001 have since been produced with improved characteristics. squalamines are compounds that alter the cellular microenvironment. this compound has also been successful in phase II trials for retinal vasculopathies and cancer. a nucleic acid polymer, REP 2055, has been shown to be able to inhibit the release of HBsAg from infected hepatocytes. novel drug targets have been identified in other hepatotropic viruses as well. the virus genome encodes a limited number of proteins, all of which can be categorized primarily into structural and non-structural proteins. the virus genome encodes a limited number of proteins, all of which can be categorized primarily into structural and non-structural proteins. examples are influenza A virus M2, HIV-1 Vpu, picornavirus 2B and HCV p7.96. steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent attachment, entry, release from the intracellular vesicle, uncoating and replication, assembly and egress. amantadine and rimantadine have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the ion channel activity of M2.98,99. several influenza strains with specific point mutations have been identified recently. these mutations most likely affect the drug binding sites of the M2 channel by altering binding pocket hydrophobicity or the overall conformation of the channel. NN-DNJ was found to interfere with p7 oligomerization via interaction with a specific phenylalanine residue at the 25th position. the inhibitory activity of adamantane was found to be due to binding of the inhibitor at a peripheral site (Leu20) that is exposed on the membrane, separate from the NN-DNJ binding site. the non-structural 2B protein of HAV was found to contain a stretch of 60 residues in its C-terminus. a combination of crosslinking studies, biophysical assays and simulation was employed to determine that 2B probably forms dimers and generates 3 nm pores in membranes. the resulting alteration of membrane permeability is thought to be essential for HAV replication. Western European patients infected with HCV genotype 1 reportedly achieve a higher SVR (50%) than the North American patient population (40%). genotype 2 was the most susceptible (SVR > 80%) the rate of SVR achieved depends on the combination used, the genotype, the presence of resistant strains and the disease severity. attempts to create an effective vaccine against HCV have not been successful till date due to the extreme sequence variation of the virus genome. acute infections with HBV are treated symptomatically47,48. no specific treatment regimen exists. however, patients who develop acute liver failure resulting from severe HBV infection are administered oral anti-HBV medication. peg-IFN-based therapy is prescribed for a period of 48 weeks for patients who have the best possibility for HBe seroconversion. combination of adefovir and/or lamivudine with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) has been found to be effective. an effective vaccine against HBV exists and is administered 3\u20134 times over a 6 month period. studies have shown that long-term treatment with Peg-IFN helps in clearance of the virus in about 25% of the cases. Western European patients infected with HCV genotype 1 reportedly achieve a higher SVR (50%) than the North American patient population (40%). the SVR achieved with this treatment in case of patients infected with genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6 was observed to be higher in general compared to genotype 1-infected patients (SVR > 80%). the rate of SVR achieved depends on the combination used, the genotype, the presence of resistant strains and the disease severity. attempts to create an effective vaccine against HCV have not been successful till date due to the extreme sequence variation of the virus genome. administration of ribavirin was found to help in prompt clearance of the virus after a certain time period. acute infections with HBV are treated symptomatically47,48 and no specific treatment regimen exists. patients who develop acute liver failure resulting from severe HBV infection are administered oral anti-HBV medication. the currently approved drugs are interferons, Peg-IFN-2a for adults and IFN-2b for children. peg-IFN-based therapy is prescribed for 48 weeks for patients who have the best possibility for HBe seroconversion. combination of adefovir and/or lamivudine with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) is not recommended because of a low off-treatment response for the former. an effective vaccine against HBV exists and is administered 3\u20134 times over a 6 month period. there are no known effective therapeutic strategies available for treatment of either the acute or chronic forms of HDV infection. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, entecavir, stavudine, abacavir etc. are available for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus. other effective inhibitors include favipiravir, which can successfully inhibit both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses and has been approved for the treatment of influenza virus in Japan. saquinavir, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and tipranavir have been approved by the fda. a more effective treatment regimen of simeprevir, asunaprevir and rupintrivir is now available. pressive drugs sanglifehrin A and cyclosporine A.62 have been found to inhibit viral infections. the indole derivative arbidol interferes with virus membrane fusion and entry of enveloped viruses. the indole derivative interferes with virus membrane fusion and entry of enveloped viruses. three types of site-specific DNA binding proteins are being engineered to target cccDNA. zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas endonucleases. ARC-520, one such drug under development, has shown promising results in vitro. 90,91 A nucleic acid polymer, REP 2055, has been shown to be able to inhibit the release of HBsAg from infected hepatocytes. recent studies have also shown that the HBV RnaseH, which is critical for virus replication, can also be an important drug target. viroporins can alter ionic concentration and remodel host cell membranes. oligomerization levels can range from dimeric association (e.g. in HAV 2B)97 to large heptameric assemblies (e.g. in HCV p7).
