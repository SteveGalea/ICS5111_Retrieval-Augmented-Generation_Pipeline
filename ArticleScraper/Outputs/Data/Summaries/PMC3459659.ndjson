{"summary": "the global initiative for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease defines chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a common preventable and treatable disease. exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation, which lead to airway wall edema, sputum plugging, and bronchoconstriction. in 2010, COPD accounted for $49.9 billion in health care expenditures in the united states alone. salmeterol plus fluticasone reduced the rate of FEV1 decline by 16 mL/year compared with placebo at 3 months. inhaled corticosteroids showed a significant improvement in lung function decline compared with placebo at 3 months. after 6 months there was no significant difference between placebo and inhaled corticosteroid treatment. lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 signalling lipopolysaccharide recognition is facilitated by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and CD14. this in turn facilitates the transfer of LPS to the TRL4/MD2 complex. this triggers a signaling cascade in macrophage lineage and endothelial cells. in monocytes and macrophages, LPS triggers the production of powerful inflammatory mediators including cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- and platelet-activating factor), which stimulate production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. intranasal LPS challenge may be the least invasive and best tolerated model. clinical symptoms are minimal; however, very little or no data have been published to date using this model. further validation of the model needs to be performed to compare it to the LPS inhalation challenge model. IMP LPS model Effects on inflammatory markers Progression to Phase III Sources Prednisolone Oral Inhaled No effect on lung inflammation, reduction in CRP (P = 0.09) Yes, development terminated due to lack of efficacy 13 Fluticasone Inhaled Significant reduction in neutrophils and eosinophils. 4 large RCTs in COPD are ongoing in acute lung injury. O3 levels have been associated with exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and pneumonia. experimental exposure in healthy subjects is known to elicit a reversible impairment in lung function. circulating CD11b plays a role in the inflammatory response following inhaled O3 exposure. a number of different classes of therapeutic agents have been studied in the O3 challenge model in healthy volunteers. therapeutic classes include corticosteroids (administered orally and by inhalation) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. more recently, studies investigating the effects of CXC chemokine receptor 1, 2 antagonists have been reported. indomethacin was shown to significantly reduce O3-induced decrements in FEV1 and forced vital capacity. this was associated with reductions in subjective symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and throat tickle on indomethacin treatment. sputum neutrophils were significantly reduced in the active group by 57%. there were fewer mild exacerbations (1.3 vs 2.25; P = 0.05) and fewer severe exacerbations in the SCH527123 group. human rhinovirus replicates at 33\u00b0C\u201335\u00b0C and thus has been linked to upper airway infections. evidence exists that HRV is not limited to the upper airways. the gene for ICAM-1 maps to human chromosome 19. healthy subjects, subjects with asthma, and subjects with allergic asthma have been intensively studied in clinical trials inoculating them with rhinovirus 16 or other rhinovirus serotypes. these studies demonstrated that rhinovirus infection of the lower airways is common after experimental inoculation. there was an increase, although not statistically significant, in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. peak expiratory flow fell by 23.5 mL in the controls and by 50.5 mL (P 0.05) in the COPD patients. use as a preclinical and clinical tool to identify and investigate novel drug targets and establish whether new therapeutic agents have potential clinical utility. targets against soluble ICAM-1 and thus inhibit interaction of HRV with ICAM-1,59,60 inhibitors of rhinovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases 3D,61 activators of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1,62 inhibitors of VP-163 and inhibitors of different rhinovirus proteases. LR4 signalling is facilitated by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and CD14. can be separated into MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. kinin activation releases bradykinins and other vasoactive peptides, which cause hypotension. healthy subjects inhaling endotoxin show a systemic and pulmonary inflammatory response, recruiting neutrophils and macrophages to the lung tissue. inhalation of nebulized doses (up to 50 g) of LPS via a dosimeter leads to an increase in temperature, blood C-reactive protein (CRP), blood and sputum neutrophils, blood monocytes and lymphocytes. roflumilast reduced the influx of total cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils into the airways of healthy subjects. it is important to remember that inhaled LPS challenge is a model of acute neutrophilic inflammation and not a model of COPD. O3 is a major component of urban environmental air pollution. it is formed in the troposphere from primary precursor pollutants. in the presence of light, NO2 is cleaved by sunlight to NO\u2022 + O\u2022 allowing the formation of O3 (O2 + O\u2022) there were statistically significant increases in polymorphononuclear neutrophils, prostaglandin E2, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, 1-antitrypsin, and decreased phagocytosis via the complement receptor. circulating CD11b plays a role in the inflammatory response following inhaled O3 exposure. 22 volunteers underwent controlled exposure to O3 (400 ppb for 2 hours) pretreatment with inhaled corticosteroids resulted in a significant reduction of sputum neutrophils, by 62% and 64%, respectively. this was associated with statistically significant reductions in sputum MPO, by 55% for inhaled corticosteroids and 42% for oral steroids. similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Alexis et al. SCH527123 is a novel, selective, oral chemokine receptor 2 antagonist. it inhibits neutrophil activation and modulates neutrophil trafficking in animal models. eighteen healthy O3 responders underwent O3 challenge tests 1 hour after last treatment dose. single doses of SB-656933 reduced O3-induced airway inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. corresponding reductions in myeloperoxidase levels in the sputum supernatant, by 32.8% (confidence interval: 9.2, 50.3) and 50.5% (confidence interval: 33.3, 63.3) HRV binds to intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. low-density-lipoprotein receptor38 binds to a minor group of HRV. the gene for ICAM-1 maps to human chromosome 19. total viral and human rhinovirus exacerbation rates in seven studies of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. the median tissue culture infective dose of rhinovirus was administered by the inhaled route using a nebulizer to elicit a COPD exacerbation. fected subjects met criteria defining an exacerbation of COPD. subjects in the COPD group showed significant decreased peak expiratory flow from baseline, while those in the control group did not. the blood and sputum showed a significant increase in peripheral neutrophils in the COPD group. challenge models are good predictive models of acute exacerbations of COPD. but there are ethical considerations associated with inducing exacerbations in subjects with COPD. safety boards may be advised to only consider subjects with mild COPD for inclusion in these studies. a limitation of the O3 model is that it has yet to be determined whether inhibition of neutrophilia translates into clinical benefits for patients with COPD. challenge with rhinovirus 16 to elicit mild exacerbations appears to be safe and well tolerated, but only a few COPD subjects have been exposed to this model."}
