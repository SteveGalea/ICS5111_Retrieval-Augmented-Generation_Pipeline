{"summary": "infections with picornaviruses, human rhinoviruses (HRVs), enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are frequent in human populations worldwide. EVs and HRVs are classified as members of the Enterovirus genus. virus species and type identification through amplification and sequencing of coding regions such as VP1 in the case of EVs and HPeV (14, 35, 36) and VP4 for HRVs (31, 42) require often quite degenerate primer sequences to allow effective amplification of these more divergent regions of the genome. RNA transcripts have been widely used as individual controls for the diagnostic screening of several human viruses. echovirus 7 (E7) and E30 (AF465516 and GB-27 [unpublished]), CAV-21 (D00538), and EV70 (D00820) representing EV-A to -D (A, CAV-16; B, E7, E30; C, C, C, CAV-21; D, EV70) were provided by D. J. Evans, university of warwick. for recombinant HRV-C (HRV-C RNA concentrations were converted to numbers of genome copies by assuming a mean molecular mass of each base of 330 g/mol. RNA was diluted in RNA storage solution (1 mM sodium citrate, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0; Ambion UK) containing 0.05 g/ml herring sperm carrier RNA and 0.1 U/ml RNasin. for long-term storage, RNA in storage solution was archived real-time RT-PCR was performed in 96 white-well plates using the Roche 480 LightCycler II. EV 1A, TCC TCC GGC CCC AAA GTA, EV 1P, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-CGGTTCCGCYRCAGA-MGBNFQ. RNA was directly transcribed by rHex cDNA reaction (40 l) (5), and 5 l of transcribed cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR for EV and HPeV. RNA transcripts were reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RNase H transcriptase (Promega) in a reaction mixture containing 40 U of the RT enzyme, 4 U of RNasin R 30 s at 65 to 56\u00b0C (touchdown, 1\u00b0C/cycle for the first 10 cycles) and 40 s at 72\u00b0C; and melting at 72 to 95\u00b0C at increments of 1\u00b0C/5 s. PCR was performed in 20-l reaction volumes using 100 U MMLV RT (Promega) and 0.5 mg/ml random hexamers. EV, HRV, and HPeV sequences were amplified by nested PCRs using primer pairs from the 5\u2032 UTR (50) and the VP4/partial VP2 region (50) Species C sequences were amplified by newly designed primers from VP2. EV-B (E30) and -A (CAV-16) transcripts were investigated for stability at different temperatures. a 100-l volume of a 104-copy/l dilution of each was incubated in storage solution for up to 30 days at ambient temperature, 4\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C. Sense orientation RNA transcripts were generated by T7 RNA polymerase using a MEGAscript in vitro RNA transcription kit. newly transcribed RNA was analyzed for integrity on a denaturing RNA-agarose gel with 2.2 M formaldehyde. RNA concentrations were quantified by using two methods, a nanoDrop ND-1000 quantifying optical density at 260 nm and the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA quantification system real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays were performed by five laboratories performing real-time PCR detection of EVs, HPeV, and HRV. assays used different primers, probes, and amplification conditions. l reaction mixture volumes comprising 0.2 l Superscript III RT Taq mix, 5 l 2 Reaction Mix, 3.5 mM MgSO4, 0.4 M each primer, 0.2 M probe, and nuclease-free water to a volume of 8 l. real-time RT-PCR was performed in 96 white-well plates using the Roche 480 LightCycler II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) RNA transcripts were reverse transcribed with MMLV RNase H transcriptase (Promega) in a reaction mixture containing 40 U of the RT enzyme, 4 U of RNasin RNase inhibitor, 500 nM dNTP, 1.2 M ENRI4 primer (GAAACACGGACACCCAAAGTA) and 5 l of RNA transcript in a total volume of 20 l. cDNA synthesis was carried out at 42\u00b0C for PCR was performed in 20-l reaction volumes consisting of ABI Fast Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with 5 l cDNA. primers and probes used were as follows. EV, HRV, and HPeV sequences were amplified in six replicates. a 100-l volume of a 104-copy/l dilution of each was incubated for up to 30 days. composite sequences of R4636/07 (HRVCpat19; Cc) and R3092/06 (HRV-C40; Ca) have been deposited in GenBank and assigned accession numbers JX276744 and JX276745. RESULTS Amplification of transcripts by real-time RT-PCR. the five EV transcripts showed highly reproducible amplification dynamics by real-time PCR. nonrecombinant and recombinant HRV-C sequences correspond to HRV-Cpat19 (Cc) and HRV-C40 (Ca) for real-time PCR, mean values are shown where testing was carried out in replicate. for typing assays, endpoints were calculated by 6-fold replicate testing in 10-fold dilution steps. comparison of testing for HRV transcripts from each laboratory assay showed a consistent trend toward lower amplification rates and endpoint sensitivities for HRV than for EV and HPeV transcripts. the observed variability of assay sensitivities and amplification efficiencies could be accounted for, at least in part, by the existence of sequence mismatches. RNA transcripts were amplified by nested PCR assays for capsid-coding regions (VP4/partial VP2) of EVs and HRVs, VP1 (EV-A, -B, and -D), partial VP2 (EV-C) and partial VP3/VP1 (HPeV) dilutions ranging from 105 to 102 copies/l were assayed in 6-fold replicates. nested PCR in the 5\u2032 UTR showed relatively high sensitivity. sensitivities ranged from equal sensitivity to an approximately 100-fold reduction. findings provide evidence that typing assay sensitivity is broadly comparable between types. EV transcripts were assayed by a previously described EV/HPeV multiplexed PCR method (3). the five EV transcripts showed highly reproducible amplification dynamics by real-time PCR. for each transcript, the assay endpoint sensitivity lay between 0.9 and 9 RNA copies. s of 5\u2032 UTR-based real-time assays from referral laboratories (A) and 5\u2032 UTR and coding region nested PCR assays (B) for real-time PCR, mean values are shown where testing was carried out in replicate. endpoints were calculated by 6-fold replicate testing in 10-fold dilution steps. the assays detected HPeV RNA sequences with rates and sensitivities similar to those for EVs. the observed variability of assay sensitivities and amplification efficiencies could be accounted for, at least in part, by the existence of sequence mismatches of primer and probe sequences and the target sequences. strict and 95% consensus sequences were constructed from alignments of each of the described types within EVs and HRVs. both sense and antisense primers fir HRV targeted regions in the 5\u2032 UTR that were quite variable. better conservation was observed in EVs (Fig. 4A) and HPeV-1 to -6 (data not shown) two representative EV transcripts (E30, CAV-21) were subjected to a range of temperatures and freeze-thaw cycles. their RNA content was assessed by real-time PCR. no changes in CT values were observed on freezing-thawing or incubation. significant sequence diversity in most parts of the genome complicates the development of effective assays capable of detection and identification of all species and types. for each, the 5\u2032 UTR is the most conserved region and is almost invariably targeted by existing real-time PCRs for diagnostic screening. the same transcripts were used to evaluate the sensitivity of EV, HRV, and HPeV typing assays based on the amplification and sequencing of coding region sequences. the same transcripts were used to evaluate the sensitivity of EV, HRV, and HPeV typing assays. this is necessary not only because sequence variability in the 5\u2032 UTR is so restricted as to preclude (sero)type identification. the use of an RNA dilution buffer specifically designed to prevent RNA degradation through the incorporation of RNase inhibitors and a low concentration of carrier RNA proved highly effective at maintaining high stability despite a variety of mistreatments. the minimal effect of freezing-thawing and its stability at both 4\u00b0C and ambient temperature suggest that dilution series of the RNA transcript standards can be relatively easily distributed without the need for frozen shipment."}
