{"summary": "non-pharmaceutical measures are important to prevent the spread of AI and to contain a pandemic. the effectiveness of such measures is largely dependent on the behaviour of the population. the world is now facing a new influenza pandemic caused by the new H1N1. the virus has caused 134,503 cases with 816 deaths up to July 27, 2009. the development of vaccines as well as the stockpiling of antiviral drugs has received most attention. focusing on vaccines and antiviral drugs will probably not be enough to limit the consequences of an influenza pandemic. non-medical interventions will be of great importance in the control of the epidemic. the effectiveness of both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions is largely dependent on the behaviour of the population. risk perception has been studied intensively in relation to environmental and technical-industrial risk. the first is the so-called'realistic' approach focusing on measuring the objective risk of a specific threat or danger, which can be measured independently from the social context. the second approach is the'social constructionist' approach, where the perception of risk is the result of social and cultural processes. protection motivation theory suggests that response efficacy and self efficacy are two key determinants of precautionary behaviour. response efficacy relates to the belief of people in the effectiveness of the available protective actions, for example hygienic measures. risk perception is an important factor in many health psychology models. only a few studies have studied risk perception related to emerging infectious diseases over a longer period of time. the present study explored risk perception, efficacy beliefs and precautionary behaviour related to human AI in seven consecutive surveys in the Netherlands. independent random sample was drawn of between 700 and 952 panel members from 18 years and older. each survey was online between 8 and 13 days. panel members received 1.50 Euro in credits for completion of a survey. answer possibilities ranged from very serious to not serious at all. next question asked how likely it would be that the respondents themselves would get the disease in the coming years (very small chance - very large chance) rotterdam.nl/Rotterdam/Openbaar/Diensten/GGD/Pdf/IZB/Vragenlijst%20Vogelgriep%20extra%20 meting%20aug06.pdf. asked how much information people had received about AI based on four questions. 'the avian influenza virus can be transmitted from human to human' a new dichotomous variable 'precautionary measures' was defined and coded 1 (yes), if respondents had taken any of the specific measures, and coded 0 (no) if respondents had done nothing. variables showing an association of p 0.1 were included in the multivariate analysis. over all surveys, 26%, 39% and 35% of respondents had received lower, intermediate and higher education respectively. 11% of the participants were of non-Dutch origin and 23% had been vaccinated against influenza. only 4% kept chicken or poultry at home. only HIV, 4.92 (95% CI 4.91 - 4.93), and heart disease, 4.82 (95% CI 4.80 - 4.83), had a significantly higher perceived severity. perceived vulnerability for common cold was the highest with 3.64 (95% CI 3.61 - 3.67), while for a common cold it was the lowest at 1.23 (95% CI 1.21 - 1.24). 57 - 3.62) 2.44 (2.41 - 2.47) 2.84 (2.82 - 2.87) Food poisoning 3.59 (3.57 - 3.62) 2.38 (2.71 - 2.75) Common cold 1.87 (1.85 - 1.89) 3.64 (3.61 - 3.67) 3.07 (3.05 - 3.09) all four knowledge questions were answered correctly by 10.2% of the respondents; 16.5% had all answers wrong. 6% 0.008 0.032 0.042 Not getting in touch with (wild birds or poultry 31% 39% 39% 33% 38% 38% 38% 36% 0.005 0.022 0.175 Not going to areas with AI 18% 25% 28% 23% 27% 33% 31% 26% 0.018 0.081 0.000 Paying more attention to hygiene 9% 16% 17% 16% 14% 16% 18% 15% 0.008 0.042 0.003 Eating less or no chicken or poultry time was not significantly associated with perceived severity ( = -0.002, p = 0.772) and for perceived vulnerability the regression coefficient of time was just short of being statistically significant ( = -0.011, p = 0.08) time was significantly associated with amount of information received ( = -0.065, p 0.001), knowledge ( = -0.127, p 0.001) and taking preventive measures. avoiding contact with (wild) birds or poultry was reported most often by 36% of respondents. increased over time was observed for not going to areas with AI. increased risk perceptions, precautionary actions or information received were observed. 0,002 18-29 1,66 30-44 1,63 45-59 1,73 60 + 1,75 Children 12 in household 0,024 Yes 1,64 No 1,71 Ethnicity 0,256 Dutch 1,68 Non-Dutch 1,73 Education* 0.001 Low 1,84 Intermediate 1,65 High 1,62 Think flu 0.001 Never 1,46 Rarely 1,62 Sometimes 1,88 Often/All the time 2,19 Knowledge score 0.001 0 1,80 1 1,73 2 1,72 3 1,60 4 1,53 Amount of info 0, OR 95% CI p-value Overall 1750 3811 45,9% Survey 0,001 0,001 1 218 579 37,7% 1,0 1,0 2 272 540 50,4% 1,0 1,0 2 272 540 50,4% 1,7 1,0 1,0 2,1 1,8 1,4 2,4 3 314 644 48,8% 1,6 1,3 2,0 1,6 1,3 2,1 4 230 535 43,0% 1,2 1,0 1,6 1,4 1,1 1,9 5 248 549 42,6% 0,6 0,5 0,7 0,8 0,7 0,9 Keeping chicken or poultry 0,715 No 1685 3674 45,9% 1,0 Yes 65 137 47,4% 1,1 0,8 1,5 Severity 0,001 0,001 (Not) serious [1-4] 485 1256 38,6% 1,0 1,0 Very small [1] 839 1984 42,3% 1,0 1,0 > Very small [2-5] 911 1827 49,9% 1,4 1,2 1,5 1,3 1,1 1,5 Self efficacy 0, the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis are also shown in Table 5. a higher age, a lower level of education, a non-Dutch ethnicity, being vaccinated against influenza, a higher perceived severity, a higher perceived vulnerability, a higher perceived vulnerability, a lower level of knowledge, more information about AI, and thinking more about AI were all associated with taking preventive measures. women who thought more about AI perceived their vulnerability for AI as higher. older, lower educated, of non-Dutch ethnicity, vaccinated against influenza, had higher risk perceptions or self efficacy, less knowledge, had received more information about AI, were more likely to report engagement in precautionary actions. 71 to 81% of respondents reported to avoid visiting hospitals, crowds, going out or going abroad when there was either bird-to-human transmission or human-to-human transmission [41]. the high level of perceived severity of AI in our study is in line with earlier studies conducted in Norway, the UK and Hong Kong. the level of knowledge was positively associated with the amount of information received. this relation may be associated with the decrease in media attention to avian influenza during this period. there was no significant effect on perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, nor on the amount of information or knowledge of the two episodes. a similar low comparative vulnerability as for tuberculosis was observed for AI. 'actual' knowledge about the disease is associated with lower perceived vulnerability. 'Thinking about' AI may be a proxy for worry about the disease. the percentage of people being vaccinated against influenza in our study (23%) is somewhat higher than what has been reported for the general Dutch population (18,1%) the fact that we used a research panel of which participants in the present study received a very small reimbursement for completing surveys may have resulted in higher response rates than if we used sample from the general population. the stability of the levels of risk perception gives credibility to cross-sectional one-time surveys of risk perception. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
