TRIM5a from both humans and non-human primates significantly impairs replication of TBFVs, but not MBFVs. the precise flavivirus molecular target of TRIM5a is not known. the information gained will be used to determine whether escape of MBFVs from TRIM5a is required for infection and pathogenesis in humans. ER-resident protein FAM134B serves as a key receptor for lysosomal degradation of ER (termed ER-phagy) ER-expansion induced by flaviviruses through FAM134B cleavage may occur locally to facilitate optimal replication. but further loss of FAM134B does not increase virus replication in vivo. results identify a cellular target of flavivirus antagonism to promote replication. wild-type NS3h and several mutants were identified and tested in several biochemical assays, viral replication assays, and analyzed in MD simulation. they observed that ser411Ala possesses a hyper-active helicase phenotype, meaning the mutation causes the helicase to unwind dsRNA more quickly than wild type (WT) dengue protease is incapable of cleaving DGAT2. they predict that dengue virus is manipulating the host lipid environment by preventing the production of triacylglycerol from diacylglycerol, a process facilitated by DGAT2. no human or animal studies were performed. arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway is canonically antiviral due to its role in inflammation. de novo synthesis of AA was blocked by inhibiting fatty acid desaturase 2, release of AA from phospholipids. 5-lipoxygenase was inhibited to block the initiation of AA metabolism. no human or animal studies were performed. sphingolipids have long been recognized for their role in cellular membrane structural integrity. decreases in serum sphingosine-1-phosphate by DENVs has also been shown to be a driving factor of the endothelial barrier failure and subsequent vascular leakage observed in severe dengue disease. sphingolipid metabolism is required by DENVs to establish a productive infection, while other metabolites are altered by the host in order to activate the host antiviral response. pol II was recruited to all temporal classes of genes by 3 h post infection. the most striking difference between immediate early and late genes at early times was efficient movement into immediate early gene bodies. proximal pausing became prominent on immediate early genes by 6 h post infection, while progression into elongation was rapid on late genes. pol II complexes accumulated just downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of the IE gene 22 entered the gene body within 5 min. pol II remained paused just downstream of the TSS of the g2 gene UL44 for at least 60 min. no human or animal studies were performed. a central difficulty in dissecting the specific genetic functions responsible for these phenotypes is related to the genetic complexity of the RL region. in this talk, he described recent results using ribozymes targeting specific RNAs in vivo using AAV vectors. he described the use of an in vitro human neuronal culture system to dissect LAT and miRNA functions and characterize different profiles of lncRNA expression during latency. manipulation of CDK8 activity by chemical inhibition, and CDK8 expression by lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown, changes the outcome of dengue infection by influencing viral genome replication and ultimately infectious particle production. no human or animal studies were performed. study found that IAV disrupts host genome interactions downstream of highly transcribed genes. this effect is caused by IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which inhibits pre-mRNA cleavage at 3\u2032 polyadenylation signals. this results in nuclear retention of unprocessed newly transcribed mRNA transcripts. p38 MAPK has been known as the master switch for the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B)-mediated inflammatory response. p38 MAPK has been known as the master switch for the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B)-mediated inflammatory response. interferon induced tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit2) represented in mice by IFN induced tetratricopeptide repeats gene, ISG54. despite the enormous viral load Ifit2 deficient mice are impaired in microglial activation and recruitment of peripheral innate monocyte/leukocyte into the central nervous system (CNS) congenital human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection causes a broad spectrum of central and peripheral nervous system disorders. ramifications mandate the study of host\u2013virus interactions in neural cells. iPSCs can be cultured in three-dimensions to generate cerebral organoids, closely mimicking in vivo development. crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus capable of causing a severe disease within infected humans. in humans, CCHF presents as a non-specific febrile illness that can then rapidly progress to hemorrhagic manifestations. the disparate pathogenicity of cedV and its relatives has yet to be fully investigated. the disparate pathogenicity of cedV and its relatives has yet to be fully investigated. the disparate pathogenicity of cedV has yet to be fully investigated. new world bats may be useful animal models for the study of henipaviruses. this work is the first to show that cells from a species of new world bat are susceptible to henipaviruses. syncytia formation is a common feature of sporadic AD. VZV reactivation (zoster) significantly increases dementia risk. compared to stroke controls, VZV vasculopathy CSF had elevated levels of amylin and of amyloid fibrils that correlated with viral titers. compared to stroke controls, VZV vasculopathy CSF had elevated levels of amylin and of amyloid fibrils. herpesvirus has been recognized as the etiological agent of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS) for 25 years. the association of KS with HIV infection, immunosuppression, and high KSHV viral loads suggests an essential role for the immune response in limiting KSHV pathogenesis. inducible B12 inhibited the replication of the adapted virus mutant, B1mutB12, without impacting cellular growth. inducible B12 inhibited the replication of the adapted virus mutant, B1mutB12, without impacting cellular growth. recent, but not historic, viral isolates from the united states are capable of infecting spinal cord motor neurons in vivo and neuronal cells in vitro. the biological basis of the increased virulence and recently acquired ability of contemporary EV-D68 to induce CNS disease is unknown. IFN-Is are cytokines that exhibit potent antiviral activities. the clinically-approved subtype, IFN2, was significantly less potent at inhibiting HIV-1 in primary mucosal CD4+ T cells compared to IFN6, IFN8 and IFN14. the overlap of interferomes between the IFN subtypes ranged from 59% to 82%. IFN14 altered 243 genes that were not altered by other IFN subtypes. (4) IFN5 downregulated multiple genes that were upregulated by other IFN subtypes. human infection is initiated through the injection of a relatively small initial inoculum comprised of a genetically complex virus population. they used a barcoded ZIKV to infect African green monkey cells and picked individual plaques for sequencing to determine the number of virus genomes that initiated each plaque. a range of one to 212 virus genomes initiated individual plaques (average of 10), but very few results in more than two dominant genomes. the xrRNA1 tertiary structure was solved and used to predict novel interactions within the xrRNA1 pseudoknot that are essential for resistance of host Xrn1 activity. a single cytosine at position 22 of xrRNA1 is thought to stabilize the phosphate backbone kink that forms the RNA pseudoknot. they hypothesize that replacing the cytosine with a guanine base at this position will decrease the production of s complement genes were notated for patterns of positive selection in simian primates. they assessed co-crystal structures of complement proteins in complex with virus proteins. they found key amino acids facilitating their interaction are rapidly evolving in primates. six primate species encode CD4 receptors that fully support the entry of early HIV-1 isolates despite their weak binding affinity for CD4. the findings will help inform long-standing efforts to model HIV-1 transmission and early disease in primates. l development instigated by the antiviral immune response is impractical. all animal studies were performed following guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Colorado State University. the benefit of elevated estradiol on antibody responses and protection against influenza in females is diminished with age in both mice and humans. both sex steroids and X-linked genes affect antibody production and results in sex-specific differences in the efficacy of vaccination against influenza. this work was supported by the NIH/ORWH/NIA Specialized Center of Research Excellence in Sex Differences U54AG062333. nAb responses exist against each of the Ads tested and are effectively transferred to newborns. neither the HIV-1 infection status of the mothers or the antiretroviral therapy treatment of HIV-1 had significant impact on maternal Ad nAb responses. Dried blood spots (DBSs) were collected from mother\u2013infant pairs during routine HIV-1 screens in Lusaka, Zambia from 2015 to 2018, DNA was extracted. forty-nine percent of samples had at least one DRM and were resistant to at least two ARTs. domestic cat FeLV replicates poorly in pumas versus domestic cat cells. FFV spreads efficiently from puma to puma, with limited host restrictions for onward transmission. the dsRNA is expected to serve as a trigger of the mosquito\u2019s RNA interference anti-viral immune pathway. they developed a quantitative assay for detection of those sRNAs in mosquito midguts. this method could provide vital information for optimization of paratransgenic bacteria strains. rabbits infected with MYXVorfC survived longer (p 0.05) and had a delayed onset of clinical signs as compared to rabbits infected with MYXVorfC. tochemistry remains the gold standard for diagnosing CWD, real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) can detect substantially lower concentrations of prions. RT-QuIC detected seeding activity in tonsil biopsies on average of 2.2 months (3\u201312 months) earlier than IHC detection. chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emergent transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids now identified in North America, south Korea, and Scandinavia. the exact mechanisms of CWD transmission remain unknown. previous studies have shown that nasal olfactory epithelium can contain CWD seeding activity. no human or animal studies were performed. myxoma virus replication in neoplastic canine cells is affected by type 1 interferons. treatments were not cytotoxic to STS or OSA cells. no animal or human studies were performed. laboratory benches, equipment and instruments are routinely exposed to 20,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite. 4% acetic acid sodium lauryl sulfate (4% acetic SDS) has been incorporated into prion laboratory cleaning regimens. 4% acetic SDS decreased CWD burden by 17%. the ability to detect blood-borne prions by in vitro methods remains difficult. their work has focused on refinement of the prion amplification methods RT-QuIC and PMCA. the findings permit assessment of the role hematogenous prions play in the pathogenesis of CWD. confocal microscopy showed that ds-eGFP was delivered to mosquito midguts. immunoprecipitations of an RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC) protein (Ago2-FLAG) were performed to show that dsRNA was processed into sRNAs by the RISC. TRIM5a is an IFN-stimulated gene originally identified as a major restriction factor for HIV-1 in rhesus macaques. the precise flavivirus molecular target of TRIM5a is not known. recombinant LGTV with the resistant mutations at V559 did not recruit TRIM5a-Apex to replication complexes. the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a multipart network of continuous sheets and tubules, extending from the nuclear envelope to the plasma membrane. ER-resident protein FAM134B serves as a key receptor for lysosomal degradation of ER (termed ER-phagy) while FAM134B over-expression results in ER fragmentation and autolysosomal degradation. the unwinding of flavivirus dsRNA is achieved by the helicase domain of NS3. NS3 is known to translocate along and unwind dsRNA in an ATP-dependent manner. but the mechanism of energy transduction between the ATP and RNA binding pockets is not well understood. the dengue virus genome encodes a protease known to cleave at least one host protein as well as the viral polypeptide. they also identified the cleavage motif and showed that when the cleavage motif is mutated, the dengue protease is incapable of cleaving DGAT2. gent inhibitors of autophagy induce autophagy in infected cells. when autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine, the VZV titer was reduced. in a third study, they selected the anti-autophagy antibiotic bafilomycin A1 (BAF) the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway is canonically antiviral due to its role in inflammation. the function of AA metabolism is ambiguous with regards to DENVs due to the dual roles of AA in lipid metabolism and the immune response. sphingolipids have long been recognized for their role in cellular membrane structural integrity. pathogeneses of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, and viral infection have been linked to perturbations of sphingolipid homeostasis. sphingolipid metabolism is required by DENVs to establish a productive infection. other metabolites are altered by the host in order to activate the host antiviral response. no human or animal studies were performed. promoter proximal pausing became prominent on immediate early genes by 6 h post infection. blocking DNA replication with acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid precluded full Pol II occupancy along the genome. however, progression into elongation was rapid on late genes. pol II remained paused just downstream of the g2 gene UL44 for at least 60 min. the temporal cascade of HSV-1 gene expression is regulated by pol II recruitment onto promoters of different temporal classes. no human or animal studies were performed. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Florida. jasmine Donkoh, connie Brewster, Sandra Quackenbush,.

Sandra Quackenbush, Sandra Qua ZIKV is a mosquito borne flavivirus that is associated with microcephaly outbreaks in south America in 2016\u20132017. deNV, a close relative of ZIKV, has been shown to alter cellular metabolism, resulting in an alteration in metabolites and host proteins. IAV disrupts host genome interactions downstream of highly transcribed genes. this effect is caused by IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which inhibits pre-mRNA cleavage at 3\u2032 polyadenylation signals. this results in nuclear retention of unprocessed newly transcribed mRNA transcripts, including of antiviral genes. p38 MAPK has been known as the master switch for the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B)-mediated inflammatory response. inhibition of p38 MAPK also potently suppresses ISG transcription even in presence of interferon. despite the enormous viral load Ifit2 deficient mice are impaired in microglial activation and recruitment of peripheral innate monocyte/leukocyte into the central nervous system. Ifit2/ mice lack protective host innate immunity. progenitor cells are permissive for lytic infection, but not permissive. iPSCs can be cultured in three-dimensions to generate cerebral organoids. iPSCs were subjected to a cerebral organoid generation protocol. crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe disease within infected humans. cases of CCHF are reported throughout africa, eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia. despite continued CCHF cases across a wide geographic range, little is known about the host adaptive responses that control the infection. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the disparate pathogenicity of cedV and its relatives has yet to be fully investigated. this work is the first to show that cells from a species of New World bat are susceptible to henipaviruses. the results suggest that new world bats may be useful animal models for the study of henipaviruses. compared to stroke controls, VZV vasculopathy CSF had elevated levels of amylin and of amyloid fibrils that correlated with viral titers. intracellular amyloid was found, and an extracellular amyloidogenic environment produced. these results indicate viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD by upregulating cellular amyloidogenic proteins and producing self-aggregating viral peptides that accelerate amyloid fibrillization. non-neutralizing antibodies may play a role in preventing KS development. no studies have investigated this role for KSHV antibodies. preliminary data shows ADCC mediating antibodies are not common. inducible B12 inhibited the replication of the adapted virus mutant, B1mutB12, without impacting cellular growth. inducible B12 inhibited the replication of the adapted virus mutant, B1mutB12, without impacting cellular growth. several picornaviruses can be released from cells in a non-lytic fashion via extracellular vesicles. they examined EV-D68 viral structure using ultracentrifugation. a second naked virus peak at 1.19 g/cm3 and a third viral peak were consistent with an enveloped form of the virus. the antiviral potencies correlate with the binding affinity to the IFNAR2 subunit of the IFN-I receptor. they titrated recombinant IFN subtypes and IFN in a reporter cell line harboring the IFN response element of a canonical IFN stimulated gene. studies using human subjects or tissue samples have been either approved or deemed non-human subject research by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Colorado. they demonstrated that single cell infections likely begin with multiple genomes. it has been assumed that infection by ZIKV is initiated by individual virus particles binding and entering a cell. populations of infectious units of ZIKV were separated mechanically by centrifugation. larger infectious units were found to reform after removal. no animal or human studies were performed. xrRNA1 and xrRNA2 mutants do not exhibit decreased viral replication during infection when compared to wild type (WT), clone-derived ZIKV in both mosquito and mammalian cell lines. they have found that these xrRNA mutants produce an attenuated infection phenotype when used to infect a well-established in vivo mouse model. no human or animal studies were performed on the selective use of primate CD4 receptors by HIV-1. individuals infected with HIV-1 harbor complex viral populations within their bloodstreams. fetal outcomes occur in roughly 2%\u20134% of all live births. fetal outcomes occur in roughly 2%\u20134% of all live births. the maternal immune response to the pathogen inadvertently contributes to fetal outcomes. males and females were immunized with an inactivated H1N1 vaccine. females had greater antibody responses and protection against challenge. antibody derived from vaccinated females was better at protecting nave males and females than males. adenoviruses (Ads) and Ad-based vectors have been demonstrated to induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in humans. there exists a debate as to whether pre-existing immunity might decrease the efficacy of Ad vectored vaccines. the definition of this \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d provides important foundational data for rational design and implementation of Ad vectors in this setting. all studies using human subjects or tissue samples have been either approved or deemed non-human subject research. infants had greater amounts of DRM leading to higher magnitude resistance. prevalence of NNRTI resistance was significantly higher than that of other ART classes. further studies are needed to reduce the prevalence of DRMs in infants. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. they discussed paratransgenic delivery of dsRNA to stimulate the mosquito anti-viral RNAi response against a recombinant Sindbis-eGFP (Togaviridae) virus. mosquito-processed sRNAs were determined using qPCR and standardized to the number of colony forming units on Luria broth agar plates. this method could provide vital information for optimization of paratransgenic bacteria strains. no human or animal studies were performed. rabbits infected with MYXVorfC survived longer (p 0.05) and had a delayed onset of clinical signs. future studies will determine if MYXVorfC is a more effective oncolytic virus than MYXV. chronic wasting disease continues to expand across North America and Canada. RT-QuIC detected seeding activity in both tonsil and RAMALT biopsies 2\u20134 months prior to IHC. seeding activity was detectable even when lymphoid follicles were not present to permit meaningful IHC analysis. prion shedding in nasal secretions in 11 of 20 deer as early as two months after first tonsil biopsy positivity (mean = 10.3 months; range: 2\u201317 months) prion shedding in nasal secretions occurred in 11 of 20 deer as early as two months after first tonsil biopsy positivity (mean = 10.3 months; range: 2\u201317 months) myxoma virus replication in neoplastic canine cells is affected by type 1 interferons. cytokine responses to MYXV inoculation of cancer cells were compared to non-permissive canine fibroblasts. no human or animal studies were performed. proposed regulation of type I IFN responses could allow for targeted adjustments to MYXV replication in spontaneous tumors. prion laboratory cleaning regimens include short-term exposure to 20,000 ppm hypochlorite or 4% acetic SDS to inactivate prion infectivity in a laboratory setting. they demonstrated that a laboratory cleaning regimen including short-term exposure to 20,000 ppm hypochlorite results in sterilizing inactivation of prion infectivity while 4% acetic SDS decreased CWD burden by 17%. prion seeding activity in buffy coat cells harvested from deer orally dosed with 300 ng CWD-positive brain or saliva. detection of prions in as few as 5 105 buffy coat cells harvested from subclinical CWD-positive deer. findings permit assessment of role hematogenous prions play in pathogenesis of CWD. ichia coli (E. coli, HT27), and symbionts were transformed to express ds-GFP and/or Ago2-FLAG.
