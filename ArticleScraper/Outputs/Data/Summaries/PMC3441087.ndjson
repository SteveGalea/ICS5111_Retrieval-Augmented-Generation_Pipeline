{"summary": "both feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVple) and Mycobacterium bovis are found in the lion (Panthera leo) population in the Kruger National Park (KNP), south africa. differences have been found in the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell subset [4] and the prevalence of AIDS-defining conditions [8] in FIVple-infected lions when compared with non-infected lions. lion, leukocytosis, monocytosis, anaemia, neutrophilia, hypoalbunemia and hyperglobulinemia were found. in humans, one of the most well-known pathogen\u2013pathogen interactions is between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. half of lions in the KNP are co-infected with FIVple and M. bovis [32] little is known about the effects of their interaction. previous literature on infection in lions in the KNP is scarce and has often only been anecdotal, using small groups of animals. the animals Most lions were captured with call-up stations in designated areas in the southern, central and northern part of the park. lions were brought to the Veterinary Station as emaciated or problem lions. locations outside the KNP indicate escaped lions. lions were micro-chipped and given a unique brand so the animals could be recognized at future captures. almost twice as many study lions originated from the south, when compared with the central and northern areas. lions were micro-chipped and given a unique brand so the animals could be recognized. the sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, when using the Western blot as the gold standard, is 78.6 per cent and the specificity 100 per cent [40]. sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, when using the Western blot as the gold standard, is 78.6 per cent and the specificity 100 per cent. no. lions total (cal.; vet.; unk) with BTB and FIVple result 240 (191; 49; 0) 205 (165; 40) FIVple result 561 (415; 137; 9) 205 (165; 40) haematology (Ht, WBC) Ht: 435 (320; 105; 10) WBC: 375 (260; 105; 10) WBC: 163 (123; 40) blood chemistry ( a total of 205 lions subjected to both FIVple and BTB-specific diagnostic tests were used to study the potential synergistic effects of the infectious agents on the body condition. the following multivariable logistic regression model was used: 2.2 where represents the intercept, e residual error and BCS, FIV and BTB are binary variables coded as defined earlier. the animals Most lions were captured with call-up stations in designated areas in the southern, central and northern part of the park. the animals Most lions were captured with call-up stations in designated areas in the southern, central and northern part of the park, which were known to have lions. all lions were immobilized with tiletamine and zolazepam (Zoletil 100, Virbac) blood samples were obtained from the medial saphenous vein as soon as possible after anaesthesia in heparin, EDTA and serum Vacutainer tubes. serum was collected and stored at 20\u00b0C. status of individual lions was determined by performing the Single Intradermal Cervical Test. a lion was considered BTB positive when 3 days after intradermal administration of bovine tuberculin, the skin swelling was 2 mm or larger. the SICT appears not to be influenced by FIVple, in contrast to the tuberculin skin test in humans. the SICT appears not to be influenced by FIVple, in contrast to the tuberculin skin test in humans. the sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, when using the Western blot as the gold standard, is 78.6%. lions captured at call-up station (cal), lions brought to veterinary station (vet) or lions with unknown capture method (unk) no. lions total (cal.; vet.; unk) with BTB and FIVple result 240 (191; 49; 0) 205 (165; 40) a total of 205 lions subjected to both FIVple and BTB-specific diagnostic tests were used to study the potential synergistic effects of the infectious agents on the body condition. the following multivariable logistic regression model was used: 2.1a and 2.1b where represents the intercept, e residual error and where the other variables are coded as defined earlier. all models were checked for normality and homoscedasticity. results The models assessing the dependency of FIVple and BTB on variables area, period, age, sex and BCS showed that FIVple positivity was significantly related to sex. no significant differences were found between the observed group sizes and the expected group sizes based on the FIVple and BTB prevalences. the co-infected lions had a slightly higher percentage of lions with a low BCS (figure 2) compared with the other groups. beta coefficients are given with their 95% confidence interval between brackets. all values of a blood parameter should be added, for example, for globulin. n.s., these variables were not statistically significant. n.s. n.s. n.s. n.s. n.s. n.s. n.s.

MPZ/central (reference) LPZ/north 2.0 ( 70 per cent of infected animals examined post mortem had only a mild infection. but their number was too small to allow statistically significant conclusions. effect of both FIVple and M. bovis infection on blood parameters may indicate chronic disease, such as anaemia. mycobacterium bovis prevalence was significantly different between the three areas in the KNP. the prevalence of M. bovis-infected animals in the northern part of the KNP increased significantly with time from 0 to 41 per cent. macroscopic lesions in lions have been found to be very different from those in ungulates and non-human primates. differences in immune response in feline and simian species have also been noted for immunodeficiency viruses, related with specific virus\u2013host co-adaptation and viral load. fewer young animals have been captured at call-up stations. this may count for animals in a bad condition. lions that were brought to the veterinary station were collected with different effort over the three areas. co-infection is causing a serious conservation threat to KNP lions. however, a significant spatio-temporal increase of BTB was found. previous studies have related BTB to diverse pathological lesions."}
