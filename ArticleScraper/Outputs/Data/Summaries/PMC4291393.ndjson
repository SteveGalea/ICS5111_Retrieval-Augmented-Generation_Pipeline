{"summary": "peptidic HIV-1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) fusion inhibitors led to the development of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and six-helix bundle (6-HB) formation assays. none of the compounds at 10 M could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV S-mediated membrane fusion. ribavirin and mycophenolic acid were reported to inhibit MERS-CoV replication (6), for inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion using HR2P as a control. a cell-cell fusion inhibition assay was performed as described before.

HR2P and tamoxifen citrate showed some inhibitory activity on clathrin-mediated endocytosis of MERS-CoV with IC50s of 14.28 and 7.46 M. other MERS-CoV replication inhibitors had no significant inhibitory activity at a concentration of 40 M. the use of HR2P in combination with these reported MERS-CoV replication inhibitors may have a synergistic effect."}
