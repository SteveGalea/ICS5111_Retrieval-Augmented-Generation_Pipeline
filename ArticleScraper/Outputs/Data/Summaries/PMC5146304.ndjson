{"summary": "serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia. study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the training, research and application center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. hepcidin is a low molecular weight, antimicrobial peptide hormone. it is produced by the liver as a first-line response to inflammatory reactions. it is produced by the liver as a first-line response to inflammatory reactions. serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and Fe levels in calves suspected of neonatal septicemia before and after treatment. animals were given standard treatment (antibiotic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, fluid therapy, and intestinal astringent) hematological (WBC, lymphocyte [LYM], red blood cells [RBC], mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hematocrit [HCT] analysis was performed on blood counter (VG-MS4e\u00ae, Melet Schloesng, France) the results were evaluated using the t-test in the SPSS\u00ae statistical package program. samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. serum hepcidin (Mybiosource\u00ae), TAS (rel Assay Diagnostics\u00ae) and TOS (rel Assay Diagnostics\u00ae) were determined using commercial ELISA kits. the treatment of calves resulted in significant changes in the hematological parameters that were examined except for RBC. the WBC count, LYM count, MCV and HCT significantly changed after treatment (n=15) the average body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rates of the animals were 37.180.13\u00b0C, 1044.33/min, and 28.860.75/min pre-treatment. serum hepcidin and TOS levels were significantly lower than before treatment in calves with suspected septicemia before and after treatment. treatment After treatment p value WBC (109/L) 16.301.25 11.470.79 p0.01 LYM (109/L) 6.050.83 3.50.38 p0.01 RBC (1012/L) 9.070.42 11.010.84 p>0.05 MCV (fl) 44.571.13 41.250.96 p>0.05 WBC=White blood cell, RBC=Red blood cells, MCV=Mean corpuscular volume, HCT increased hepcidin concentrations reduce serum Fe levels by decreasing Fe release from macrophages and hepatocytes. hepcidin levels in calves with suspected septicemia were significantly high before treatment when compared to after treatment. hepcidin levels in neonatal infants with sepsis were significantly higher than in healthy infants. the antioxidant and oxidative system are in a constant state of balance in the organism. any event breaking up this balance in favor of the oxidative stress molecules will cause cell damage [27,28] all authors read and approved the final manuscript.
