{"summary": "systematic sampling was conducted for 9 days from June to July 2014. only pigs aged over 6 months were eligible results due to maternal antibodies. infected status of all farms sampled was clarified prior to sampling. serial two-fold dilutions of sera were mixed with an equal volume of NK94P6 Tr () suspension containing 100 the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and then an equal volume of suspended Vero cells (approximately 30,000 cells/well) were added to each well. 333 samples were collected from 16 case farms and 1,223 samples were collected from 64 non-case farms. all samples were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 5 min to obtain sera. the cut-off titer was set at 2 in accordance with the NT method established by the Japanese National Institute of Animal Health. farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms for the purposes of this study. positive animals in farrow-to-finish (FF) and wean-to-finish (WF) case farms were 74.0 and 57.3% respectively. the proportion of seropositive animals in FF and non-case farms was significantly higher than in FF for both case and non-case farms. infectious status Minimum 1st quartile Median Mean (SD) 3rd quatile Maximum Case 2.00 3.65 4.59 14.99 (30.93) 9.19 128.00 Non-case 2.33 3.12 4.00 4.84 (2.64) 5.93 9.33 NT, neutralization test. this means that some of the non-case farms might be not susceptible farms. the current passive surveillance system fails to detect subclinical PEDV infection. the actual infection status in the population can be misinterpreted when subclinical infections are present. the actual infection status in the population can be misinterpreted when subclinical infections are present. RT-PCR would be more appropriate to accurately classify cases in regard to the presence of PEDV genome. non-case farms with sero-positive animals should be further examined using RT-PCR to confirm if infectious animals exist."}
