{"summary": "the common strategy to direct the airflow and thus the contaminants transfer is room pressurization. the key difference is the required direction of airflow between the room and the adjacent space, such as a corridor. positive pressure ventilation is also designed in operating rooms. rile Drug Products [7] recommends a range of 126\u2013510 m3/h as the difference between the exhausted and supplied air in a contaminated room. the values range from 17.5 to 50 Pa. some publications refer to the airflow control as a primary means of protection of rooms. contaminants may migrate, which may have adverse human health effects. the problem is more important when frequency of door opening is high. door swinging makes the air mass from both sides blend, especially at the top edge of the door wing. research on heavy contaminants behaviour is also important due to the fact that among the heavier than air contaminants there are a lot of toxic substances belonging to the group of chemical weapons. the same pressure difference values are usually used, regardless of the kind, density or weight of the contaminants. in the case of clean areas, the value of 10\u201315 Pa is recommended as a minimum value of pressure difference protecting the room. some publications refer to the airflow control as a primary means of protection of rooms. such publications recommend a range of 126\u2013510 m3/h as the difference between the exhausted and supplied air in a contaminated room. a very important factor, which can contribute to contamination migrating between the rooms despite pressure difference, is door operation [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] door swinging makes the air mass from both sides blend, especially at the top edge of the door wing, while the difference in the airflow protects the rooms when the door is open. study on heavy contaminants behaviour is important due to the fact that among the heavier than air contaminants there are a lot of toxic substances belonging to the group of chemical weapons. in room protection focused design the same pressure difference values are usually used. the main components of the test installation were (Fig 2): Fig 2. A scheme of measuring stand\u2014ventilation system with measurement and adjustment elements. a device for adjustment and measurement of supply/exhaust airflow rate, adjustment dampers, measuring area reducers and orifice plate. the power law equation was proposed by ASHRAE in [27]: Q = c ( p ) n, (2) where: Q\u2014airflow through opening, m3/s, c\u2014flow coefficient, m3/s Pan, n\u2014pressure exponent, [\u2013], p\u2014pressure difference across opening, Pa. the results obtained depend significantly on the geometrical parameters of the openings and on the inflow and outflow of air from the opening. the following relationship was obtained: Q = 0, 067 P 0, 63 (3) with correlation coefficient R = 0.998. the test room used in the test has typical characteristics describing leakage. the test room used in the test has typical characteristics describing leakage. testing variants used in measurement series are shown in Table 2. case I (Door swing towards negatively pressurized zone) II (Door swing towards positively pressurized zone) Variant s = 10 fast s = 50 \u201eescape\u201d mode s = 10 slow s = 50 \u201eescape\u201d mode Width of door swing [cm] 10a 10a 50b 50b 10a 10a 10a 50b 50b Time of the door opening[sec.] 1.5 3 3.5 1.5 (only two adjacent test rooms had an area of 6x8 m and were 3 m high. they were connected by a single-wing swing door, 2x0.9 m in size. the measuring set-up let us precisely set and monitor the pressure difference between test rooms. the maximum measurement error of the airflow volume V, calculated as an error of a compound value was 5.3%. positive pressure in the room was measured by a pressure transducer with measuring range of 0\u2013100 Pa, resolution of 0.1 Pa and measurement accuracy of 0.5%. the results of airflow measurements are shown in Table 1. the results of the airflow volume measurements are shown in Table 1. the test room used in the test has typical characteristics describing leakage. variants s = 10 and s = 50 were realized at two values of door swing velocity, the so called \u201eslow\u201d and \u201efast\u201d. such a scenario corresponds to the case of \u201cescape\u201d from the endangered zone. the course of a single measurement series was: closing of the door, generating appropriate pressure difference, start-up of a simulated source of contamination. case \u201eI\u201d refers to the door opening towards the negatively pressurized zone, while case \u201cII\u201d refers to the door opening towards the positively pressurized zone. results of visualization performed with the door swing towards positively pressurized zone. a plume of smoke migrated to the adjacent room with the door closed. in the \u201cescape\u201d mode, the smoke practically did not migrate out of the room. a certain portion of the smoke left migrated further towards an adjacent room. a passage of a person through the door resulted in intensive turbulences. the same case was noted in previous measurement scenarios. a slow withdrawal of smoke plum to a contaminated room was observed. a similar phenomenon was noted during the measurement series with pressure difference of 7.0 and 12.5 Pa. the amount of smoke plum migrating outside was visibly smaller. increased pressure difference (5, 7, 12.5 Pa) between rooms made it possible to arrest smoke in a room when the door was open to the width of 10 and 50 cm. a passage of a person through the door resulted in intensive turbulences causing discharge of certain portion of smoke plume outside. first generation of pressure difference at 25 Pa noticeably minimizes migration of smoke plume outside, irrespective of the width of the door swing and of a passage of a person through the door. studies showed that door swing outside the room towards a positively pressurized zone was more disadvantageous in comparison to the cases when the door was opened into the contaminated room. studies performed showed that the amount of contamination depends on the velocity of contamination pumping. faster pumping made more contamination migrate. this was demonstrated by both measurement sessions for cases II 12.5 and 50 Pa. door swinging towards negative pressure causes reduction in contaminants transfer to the level specified as moderate or small already at the pressure of 7 Pa. the same effect with the door opened in the opposite direction is obtained with pressure difference of 12.5 Pa and even 25 Pa."}
