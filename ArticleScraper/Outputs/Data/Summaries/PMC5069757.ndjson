{"summary": "integrated multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses. the prospect of being able to perform multiple omics measurements on the same sample is very attractive. but the method is still difficult to implement, likely due to the distinct optimal conditions for extracting different types of molecules. the results of the proteomic analysis of samples extracted with different methods showed that the numbers of peptides detected in the samples were very similar (no significant difference) to the numbers seen with controls. the overlap of the numbers of peptides identified in samples extracted with all protocols was very high, as shown by a similarity matrix. ite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx), acetonitrile (ACN) and methanol (MeOH) parallel sample was digested with trypsin without previous extraction (Control) as a control. acetonitrile does not fully precipitate small proteins (25) this phenomenon might be due to the fact that acetonitrile does not fully precipitate small proteins. results showed that MPLEx did not affect proteome coverage or the results of quantitative analysis of the samples. similar correlations were observed across different samples by comparing MPLEx results to control or TCA extraction results. levels of proteome coverage and correlation between samples were very similar. each figure shows the number of identified proteins, correlation between replicates, and proteome coverage. copyright 2016 Nakayasu et al. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. only 1.1% and 1.9% of the proteins in Shewanella oneidensis were shown to be significantly enriched and depleted. no pattern was consistently observed across the different samples for any of the tested physical-chemical properties of the significantly enriched or depleted proteins. the small amount of enrichment or depletion of proteins induced by MPLEx is not based on such properties. 21,553 34,789 33,487 559,869 35,360 57,950 54,709 56,830 62,457 35,533 20,022 40,193 25,185 Length (aa) 373 241 406 292 402 198 313 299 497 311 525 495 507 557 309 183 370 232 GRAVY scored 0.164 0.588 0.096 0.452 0.195 0.254 0. 129 617 440 229 210 617 664 642 856 212 106 294 251 GRAVY score 0.104 0.283 0.057 0.166 0.182 0.257 0.316 0.168 0.719 0.476 0.258 0.311 0.301 0.459 0.197 0.248 0.301 0.434 pI 6.14 1.58 7.45 1.43 5.85 1.21 6.67 1.49 7.30 1.83 6.54 1.39 6.68 1.42 6.29 1.14 5. the number of peptides containing oxidized methionine residues was counted in each sample. the opposite trend was observed in mouse brain cortex and unicyanobacterial consortium samples. application of MPLEx in multi-omics study of MERS-CoV infection in a lung epithelial cell line. we specifically chose MERS-CoV because it is a deadly emerging infectious agent with subsequent disease mortality rates of approximately 40%. this is because there are currently no effective drugs available for treatment (32) LRpath analysis showed that 25 pathways were significantly enriched in differentially abundant proteins. 5 of the pathways were from the central metabolism of the cell (Fig. 3A) from these pathways, we chose the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways due to their complexity and the fact that these two pathways share most of the metabolites and enzymes therein. the proteomics analysis by itself would show differences only in the abundance of the enzymes from the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. the addition of metabolite measurements helps confirm that the pathway activity is reduced and which direction is the more affected. copyright 2016 Nakayasu et al.

Table S4 Lipidomics analysis of MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells in negative ion mode. download Table S4, XLSX file, 0.02 MB (23.9KB, xlsx). increase in fatty acid levels appears unrelated to lipid synthesis itself. degradation of phosphatidylcholines (PC), lyso-PC, phosphatidylserines (PS) and lyso-PS by phospholipases may also have contributed to the accumulation of fatty acids during infection. sphingolipids have been reported to play an integral role in viral uptake, replication, maturation, and budding during viral infection. membrane domains enriched with ceramides have been proposed to facilitate the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. apoptosis has already been reported in bronchial epithelial cells infected with MERS-CoV (40), but its relationship with the increased levels of ceramides still needs to be further investigated. PLEx study a lung epithelial cell line infected with MERS-CoV. cells were lysed by bead beating in a Bullet Blender. lysate was spun into a Falcon tube at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. each sample was processed in 5 replicates using the following protocols. the extraction procedure was adapted from the method of Folch et al. (41). 0.7 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 50 mM EDTA, 2% [vol/vol] -mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride were added to each tube. samples were shaken for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the upper phenolic phase was collected into a fresh tube. washed three times by adding 10 ml of ice-cold acetone, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 g at 4\u00b0C, and discarding of the supernatant. resulting protein pellet was dried under a stream of N2. the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C at 12,000 g to precipitate the proteins. raw data files were analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. the raw data files were processed using MetaboliteDetector (44) and manually validated. only proteins with two or more peptides that were unique were considered for further analysis. proteomics data were normalized via median centering against a rank-invariant peptide subset identified to reduce bias (48). proteomics data were normalized via median centering against a rank-invariant peptide subset identified to reduce bias (48)."}
