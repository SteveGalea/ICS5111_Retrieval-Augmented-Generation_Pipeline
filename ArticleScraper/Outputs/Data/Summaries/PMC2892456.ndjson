{"summary": "the pandemic of H1N1 2009 influenza virus poses a public health threat. worldwide at least 17919 death cases have been reported. the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has a much higher mortality rate. primers and probes for the novel pandemic H1N1 and the influenza H5N1 were derived from the protocols recommended by WHO [18,19]. the sequence of primers and probes for the novel pandemic H1N1 and the influenza H5N1 were H5-sense: 5'-GGA ACT TAC CAA ATA CTG TCA ATT TCA-3', H5-antisense: 5'-CCA TAA AGA TAG ACC A the duplex real-time RT-PCR amplification was carried out in a 20 L volume reaction with the Quantitect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) different concentrations of the primers and probes for both H5N1 and H1N1 were combined and adjusted to improve the sensitivity of the assay [20]. 0.4 M of primers and 0.2 M of probe were selected as the optimal concentration for H1 gene. reactions were incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and 52\u00b0C for 1 min. fluorescence was recorded at 52\u00b0C. the sensitivity of the single real-time RT-PCR assay was 0.2 TCID50 for both novel pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 virus. the detection threshold of the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was 0.2 TCID50 for the pandemic H1N1 and 0.02 TCID50 for H5N1 virus. a total of 236 clinical throat swab specimens from suspected cases of novel pandemic H1N1 patients were collected. the samples were first detected by WHO real-time RT-PCR protocol for influenza A (H1N1) among the 182 influenza type A positive samples, 124 specimens were positive for the pandemic H1N1 and none for the H5N1 tested by the duplex system. duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for pandemic H1N1 and high pathogenic H5N1 would play an important role for control and prevention of pandemic caused by these viruses.
