{"summary": "tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most important flaviviruses that targets the central nervous system (CNS) and causes encephalitides in humans. neuroinflammatory mechanisms may contribute to brain tissue destruction, but the induction pathways and potential roles of specific chemokines in TBEV-mediated neurological disease are poorly understood. TES expression provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying RANTES production induced by TBEV. electronic supplementary material available to authorized users."}
