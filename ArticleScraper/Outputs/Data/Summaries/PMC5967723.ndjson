{"summary": "an international Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report listed 833 species extinctions over the past 500 years and attributed only 3.7% of these to infectious disease. this low percentage of extinctions caused by infectious disease may be partly due to the past use of less sophisticated diagnostic techniques. the effects of urbanization, human population growth, altered land use, deforestation and reduced biodiversity are leading to an increase in infectious disease incidence and impact. southern bent-winged bat (M. orianae bassanii) occurs only in south-western Victoria and south-eastern south Australia (SA) there are two maternity caves, one near Warrnambool (38.3687\u00b0 S, 142.4982\u00b0 E) in Victoria and the other near Naracoorte (36.9602\u00b0 S, 140.7413\u00b0 E) in SA. the size of the Naracoorte population of southern bent-winge bat-associated adenovirus infections have been mostly asymptomatic [22\u201325] the virus was found in the gut of three common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in Germany with gastrointestinal disease but causation was not established. no serological evidence of Hendra virus infection was detected in 62 common bent-winged bats sampled in Queensland, Australia [19], but bent-winged bats that were seropositive for Nip the status of Australian bent-winged bats with respect to this viral group is unknown. we tested populations of southern and eastern bent-winged bats in south-eastern australia for ABLV, adenoviruses, filoviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses. all bats were examined for any external signs of disease, aged as juveniles or adults. only adult bats from Naracoorte were measured and swabbed, but swabs were obtained at the same time opportunistically from juvenile bats formed part of a different study. the causes of death were trauma (11 cases), unknown (nine cases), presumptive bacterial fibrino-suppurative pleuritis (one case), presumptive clostridial septicaemia (one case), parasitism (one case) and inanition (one case) oral swabs for virus detection were collected from a further 17 of these bats. manual extraction methods used water (Milli-Q, Merck, USA) as negative extraction control samples, and ILTV infected cell cultures as positive extraction control samples. PCR negative controls containing no DNA template, and PCR positive controls containing previously extracted ILTV DNA were also included. the assay for Torovirinae used an artificial oligonucleotide construct containing the primer binding regions for the respective primers. successful extraction of RNA was confirmed in positive extraction controls using reverse transcription PCRs targeting conserved motifs in domain III of the paramyxovirus RNA polymerase gene. phylogenetic tree generated from 45 amino acid long alignment using MrBayes v3.2.6 [47] with four heated chains, a chain length of 1,000,000, sampling every 10,000 iterations, and a burn in of 10%. phylogenetic tree was generated using 136 nucleotide sequences, for comparison. all factors significant at p 0.20 were subsequently included in a multivariable logistic regression model, using backward stepping. the final model only included those variables significant at p 0.20. only adult bats from Naracoorte were measured and swabbed. the oral cavity was swabbed using sterile, dry, rayon swabs. a maximum of 90 l blood was taken from the median vein of unanaesthetised bats for haematology and biochemistry. ptive clostridial septicaemia (one case), parasitism (one case) and inanition (one case) oral swabs for virus detection were collected from 17 dead bats. DNA and RNA were extracted from 200 L of RNAlater of each swab sample collected from Christmas Hills, Allansford and Naracoorte. the detection of herpesvirus DNA, extracted DNA was used as a template in a nested pan-herpesviridae PCR. negative controls containing no DNA template, and PCR positive controls containing previously extracted ILTV DNA were also included. sequences were assigned to groups of identical, or near identical (like) sequences. they contained a maximum of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the approximately 200 bp of the sequenced product. sequences were compared to published protein sequences in the GenBank database. model selection was undertaken using ModelGenerator v0.85 [49], and the Le and Gascuel model [50], with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites. a phylogenetic tree was similarly generated using 136 nucleotide sequences, for comparison. results All initial samples (a total of 213) collected from Christmas Hills, Allansford and Naracoorte (January 2016) were negative for the presence of adenoviruses and RNA viruses (i.e. ABLV, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses) no further testing was undertaken for these viruses. all the dead bats tested negative for herpesvirus, except for two southern bent-winged bats from Naracoorte, one from a liver sample and another from a lung sample. the DNA was of insufficient quality to confirm the positive results by sequencing. a similarity matrix of aligned amino acid sequences and a nucleotide phylogenetic tree are available as supplementary information. this analysis, despite the small fragment of protein sequence available for assessment and low posterior support values for some internal branches, highlighted that the detected viruses clustered within the Herpesviridae subfamilies. alignments of amino acids were generated using BLAST-X. tree was generated from 45 amino acid long alignment using MrBayes v3.2.6 [47] with four heated chains, a chain length of 1,000,000, sampling every 10,000 iterations. variable n OR 95%CI p-value Subspecies (SB) 467 0.467 0.300, 0.725 0.001 Body mass 467 0.767 0.685, 0859 0.001 Sex (M) 467 1.434 0.959, 2.143 0.079 Age (Juv) 467 0.186 0.094, 0.369 0.001 Location Group 467 0.001 Vic EB vs SA SB 11.612 5.942, 22.693 Vic SB 1.611, 6.728 Season 0.001 Spring vs autumn 0.082 0.031, 0.213 Summer vs autumn 0.242 0.074, 0.788 Summer vs spring 2.966 1.450, 6.069 Male vs female 1.839 1.081, 3.130 0.024 n = sample size. NG46-like and CH20-like betaherpesviruses were found in both subspecies and at all locations sampled. no RNA viruses were found in any of the bats tested. no serious zoonoses were detected in any of the bats examined. serology will also detect animals that have experienced infections in the past. six new herpesviruses were detected in the bats examined. five of the bent-winged bat viruses were betaherpesviruses. one virus was a gammaherpesvirus, (N7050-like) two herpesviruses (CH6-like and E22-like) were detected only in eastern bent-winged bats. another herpesvirus (N7050-like) was detected only in southern bent-winged bats. this raises the possibility that these viruses are specific for each sub-species of bent-winged bats. ill or recently dead bats are rapidly removed from caves by rats, foxes and other scavengers and rarely found in a state that allows for disease investigation. ideally, ill or recently dead bats would be surveyed as they may contain infectious agents not found in healthy bats, as demonstrated by the european filovirus outbreak. the ability of this PCR to detect latent virus in oropharyngeal swabs cannot be ruled out. a sample of southern and eastern bent-winged bats was tested by PCR. six new herpesviruses were identified across all sampled locations. the tree was generated from 136 nucleotide sequences aligned with MAFFT [45] and substitution model selection (using AIC) undertaken with ModelGenerator [49]."}
