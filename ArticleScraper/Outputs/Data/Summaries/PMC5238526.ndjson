{"summary": "a great variety of modified CDs has been developed to improve the stability and solubility of inclusion complexes [8\u201310] since the 1970s, the structural elucidation of the three natural CDs, -, -, and -CDs were discovered over a century ago. native CDs can form exclusion complexes where the CDs are bound to the guest through a H-bond network. native CDs are effective templates for the generation of a wide range of molecular hosts through chemical modifications. the first global consumer of CDs is clearly the pharmaceutical industry [35\u201336]. the first global consumer of CDs is clearly the pharmaceutical industry [35\u201336] CD.a CD Drug Formulation Trade name Market -CD Alprostadil IV solution Rigidur Europe, USA -CD Cefotiam hexetil Oral tablet Pansporin T Japan -CD Iodine Topical solution Mena-Gargle Japan -CD Nicotine Sublingual tablet Nicorette Europe -CD Piroxicam Oral tablet Flogene Brazil, Europe HP--CD Hydrocortisone Topical cream Dexocort Europe HP--CD CDs violate three criteria of the Lipinski\u2019s rule: i) no more than 5 H-bond donors, ii) no more than 10 H-bond acceptors, iii) a molecular mass less than 500 g/mol, and iv) an octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (log P) not greater than 5 [40]. Moreover, oral administration of alkylated CD derivatives, such as ME--CD, is limited by its hydrophilic CD derivatives disappear rapidly from systemic circulation. at high concentrations, -, - and alkylated CDs present renal damage and dysfunction. overt signs of acute toxicity are not apparent for CDs (i.e., no inflammatory response and no cell degeneration) biomolecule/cyclodextrin inclusions complexes Native and modified CDs can be used to complex certain chemicals produced naturally present in cells and tissues (i.e., endogenous substances). CDs can form complexes with various biomolecules including lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids. the majority of research involving CDs has revolved around their ability to manipulate lipid (phospholipids and cholesterol) composition in different cells. the mechanism of this process is poorly investigated (i.e., only the consequences of this phenomenon are reported) -CD -CD -CD for cholesterol [58] and -CD accelerate the rate of cholesterol transfer by a larger factor than they accelerate the transfer of phospholipid. the opposite is true for -CD [60]. the hemolytic properties of CDs are a general behavior not limited to human erythrocytes. the association constants were estimated from 1H NMR measurements. the results proved that the K1 values are in the order -CD -CD while the K2 values are in the order -CD -CD. the formation of a 1:2 inclusion complex with -CD is easier than with -CD. morphological changes in erythrocytes induced by methylated CDs. DM--CD induces morphological changes in rabbit erythrocytes leading to stomatocytes. DM--CD leads to echinocytes. DM--CD extract sphingomyelin form sphingomyelin-rich domains. DM--CD extract cholesterol from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (Scheme 2). lipid effluxes on the brain capillary endothelial cells in the presence of native CDs reveal that -CD extracts only phospholipids. -CD is less lipid-selective than the other native CDs. this differential effect could be attributed to the lower cholesterol content in blood\u2013brain barrier cells compared to erythrocytes. a dissimilarity of interaction between the methylated CDs with the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and with the sphingomyelin-rich domains for DM--CD and DM--CD is still open to discussion. however, the mechanism of cholesterol extraction mediated by CDs is still open to discussion. amino acids have very different chemical properties. their arrangement along the polypeptide chain determines their spatial arrangement. the secondary structure describes the arrangement of amino acid residues observed at the atomic scale stabilized mainly by H-bonds. peptides with -, -, HP--, and ME--CD increased in order -CD. stability of oligopeptides with -, -, -, HP--, and ME--CD increased. the pentapeptide conformation affects the stability of the pentapeptide/-CD inclusion complex. in contrast, the pentapeptide/-CD inclusion complex was not affected by the oligopeptide conformation. the same year, Lovatt and co-workers investigated the dissociation of bovine insulin oligomers induced by the addition of CDs. the results proved that the separation of peptides and proteins can be enhanced by adding CDs to the electrophoretic medium. however, only certain CDs can be used as selectivity enhancers. the addition of DM--CD had no effect on the separation of the mentioned proteins and peptides. the binding constants are always weaker with modified -CD than functionalized -CD. in 2009, a 1H NMR spectroscopic study revealed that the 1H NMR signals corresponding to Trp residues were shifted upon the addition of G1--CD due to encapsulation of the tryptophan residues. this allows the conclusion that these hydrophobic amino acid residues are also included by this CD. thaumatin protein is known, the authors have synthesized a heptapeptide (Lys-Thr-Gly-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe) that mimics this binding site of thaumatin. -CD binds to the solvent accessible phenylalanine residue with a binding constant of 8.8 M1. polysaccharides serve as structural components: cellulose for plants and chitin for arthropods. polysaccharides play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, blood clotting, information transfer, etc. co-workers estimated binding constants of D-glucose to -CD and -CD at 450 and 420 M1, respectively, from blood glucose meter. the results obtained by Hacket et al. are closer to the values published by Aoyama and co-workers. it is quite logical that D-glucose interacts weakly with native CDs due to its size. -CD can selectively recognize pentoses in contrast to hexoses. but the binding constants remain very small. similar conclusions were made by Paal and Szeijtli. -CD can form H-bonds with DNA base pairs that flip out spontaneously at room temperature leading to DNA denaturation. cationic CDs are known to interact strongly with DNA [109\u2013110] the host molecule releases the anthryl unit, which then leads to strong intercalation with the double-stranded DNA molecule leading to structural distortions. this behavior was clearly established from 1H NMR spectroscopy (shifts and broadening of anthryl signals) in presence of the 1-adamantanol guest. this concept could be very useful in nucleic acid reactions of medicinal and biotechnological importance for new drug delivery systems. a typical paper has been published in 2001 by leventis and Silvius. the authors examined the catalytic transfer of cholesterol between liposomes. this improvement is clearly greater than the transfer of phospholipid. the kinetics of cholesterol efflux have been examined in different cell lines. the results indicated that CDs induce cholesterol extraction from the cytoplasmic membrane typically in a range of 50\u201390% of the original amount. CDs can also catalyze the exchange of cholesterol between serum lipoproteins and cells. atherosclerosis vascular disease (ASVD) is caused by inflammation of the arterial wall. cholesterol represents a maximum of 10% of the total mass of plaque. the key step in the formation of atherosclerosis plaque is the recruitment of monocytes (a type of white blood cells), which can differentiate into macrophages and ingest LDL. Murphy et al. proposed to prevent the activation/expression of monocyte adhesion. the authors investigated the effect of different methylated -CDs on the RCT of arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. they highlighted the correlation between percentages of cholesterol extraction and the methylation degree of the CDs. this effect was clearly independent of the membrane composition. -CD increases liver X receptor (LXR) involved in antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects as well as in the RCT improvement. -CD can also be used to reduce LDL cholesterol and alter plasma fatty acid profile. this production is mediated by two neuronal enzymes (- and -secretase) which can be inhibited by methylated -CDs via cholesterol depletion. this CD dramatically lowered the levels of A42 in cells overexpressing Swedish mutant APP (SwN2a) the ability of CDs to decrease membrane cholesterol was proposed as antiviral mechanism. however, the biological effects of the CDs can be classified according to their role. the HIV is a widely studied virus in terms of the effects of CDs. -CD exhibited no significant antiherpetic activity, while -CD reduced both the cell-free and cell-associated virus more effectively than acyclovir (i.e., antiherpetic drug) the ability of -CD to impede virus replication is proposed as antiviral mechanism. the proposed mechanism of the synergy is based on the ability of CD to extract rapidly cholesterol from the viral envelope. -CD catalyzes the rapid exchange of cholesterol between the viral envelope and the aqueous solution. this means that -CD accelerates the rate of cholesterol extraction by a larger factor than - or -CD. obacter jejuni [161], leishmania donovani [162], etc. synergistic effects can be obtained for bacteria, fungi and parasites. the combination of [DiC10][Cl] and -CD allows a clear reduction of the minimum inhibitory concentration against Candida albicans compared to [DiC10][Cl] alone. this effect was only observed for the -CD/[DiC10] mixture. native CDs are effective templates for the generation of a wide range of molecular hosts through chemical modifications. hydroxy groups serve as scaffolds on which substituents can easily be introduced. hydroxy groups serve as scaffolds on which substituents can easily be introduced. CDs are very useful to form inclusion complexes with a wide range of drugs and become a very valuable tool for the formulator. many formulations that use CDs are now on the market worldwide (Table 2).

CDs are able to form complexes with various biomolecules including lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids. the majority of research involving CDs revolved around their ability to manipulate lipid (phospholipids and cholesterol) composition in different cells. the first well-documented effect of CDs is probably hemolysis. this behavior occurs at relatively high concentrations (>1 mM) rocyte membranes are in the order -CD -CD -CD for phospholipids and -CD -CD for cholesterol. the opposite is true for -CD [60]. the hemolytic properties of CDs are a general behavior not limited to human erythrocytes. the association constants were estimated from 1H NMR measurements. the results proved that the K1 values are in the order -CD -CD while the K2 values are in the order -CD -CD. the formation of a 1:2 inclusion complex with -CD is easier than with -CD. HP--CD was shown to be a more efficient cholesterol-acceptor molecule than HP--CD. this is apparently due to the diameter of its internal cavity that matches the size of this molecule. this is apparently due to the diameter of its internal cavity that matches the size of this molecule. DM--CD extract sphingomyelin form sphingomyelin-rich domains. DM--CD extract cholesterol from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. this assertion is supported by the work of Nishijo et al. the native CDs are the most toxic (-CD -CD -CD) lipid effluxes on the brain capillary endothelial cells in the presence of native CDs reveal that -CD extracts only phospholipids. -CD is less lipid-selective than the other native CDs. a non-apoptotic mechanism could be attributed to a dissimilarity of interaction between the methylated CDs with the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and with the sphingomyelin-rich domains. however, the mechanism of cholesterol extraction mediated by CDs is still open to discussion. the nature of the proteins is determined primarily by their amino acid sequence. their arrangement along the polypeptide chain determines their spatial arrangement. the secondary structure describes the arrangement of amino acid residues observed at the atomic scale stabilized mainly by H-bonds. p-nitrophenol was a competing reagent at pH 7.4. the estimated constants of free Phe increased in order ME--CD. the binding constant of free Phe with -CD was estimated at 17 M1. the binding constant of free Phe with -CD was estimated at 17 M1. the pentapeptide conformation affects the stability of the pentapeptide/-CD inclusion complex. however, the pentapeptide/-CD inclusion complex was not affected by the oligopeptide conformation. peptides and proteins can be enhanced by adding CDs to the electrophoretic medium. however, only certain CDs can be used as selectivity enhancers. the addition of DM--CD had no effect on the separation of the mentioned proteins and peptides. the binding constants are always weaker with modified -CD than functionalized -CD. in 2009, a 1H NMR spectroscopic study revealed that the 1H NMR signals corresponding to Trp residues were shifted upon the addition of G1--CD due to encapsulation of the tryptophan residues. this allows the conclusion that these hydrophobic amino acid residues are also included by this CD. authors have synthesized a heptapeptide (Lys-Thr-Gly-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe) that mimics this binding site of thaumatin. -CD binds to the solvent accessible phenylalanine residue with a binding constant of 8.8 M1. polysaccharides serve as structural components: cellulose for plants and chitin for arthropods. polysaccharides play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, blood clotting, information transfer, etc. the binding constants of D-glucose to -CD and -CD are closer to the values published by Aoyama and co-workers. the results obtained by Hacket et al. are closer to the values published by Aoyama and co-workers. this magnitude is consistent with the order of magnitude of the sugar hydrophobicity scale determined by Janado and Yano in 1985 (Scheme 4) [100]. this hydrophobicity scale is corroborated by Wei and Pohorille for the hexose series. -CD can form H-bonds with DNA base pairs that flip out spontaneously at room temperature leading to DNA denaturation. cationic CDs can be used to complex DNA and to encapsulate it into liposomes. the host molecule releases the anthryl unit, which then leads to strong intercalation with the double-stranded DNA molecule leading to structural distortions (Scheme 5). this behavior was clearly established from 1H NMR spectroscopy (shifts and broadening of anthryl signals) in the presence of the 1-adamantanol guest. acylglycerols, phosphoglycerides, sphingolipids, glycolipids and polyketides can be easily included in the CDs because they are hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecules. the majority of research involving CDs has revolved around their ability to manipulate lipid (phospholipids and cholesterol) composition in different cells. - and -CD are excellently suited to solubilize phospholipids and cholesterol, respectively, whereas -CD is generally less lipid-selective. these findings are corroborated by the work of Leventis and Silvius. binding constants between CDs and short phospholipids were estimated from 1H NMR measurements. this behavior was attributed to the large cavity of -CD which is able to incorporate both alkyl chains of DHPC simultaneously. the formation of a 1:2 inclusion complex with -CD is easier than with -CD. despite there is no information on the binding constant observed for the inclusion of cholesterol in -CD, the cavity internal diameter of the -CD and its derivatives perfectly matches the size of the sterol molecules contrary to -CD. this is apparently due to the diameter of its internal cavity that matches the size of this molecule. DM--CD induces morphological changes in rabbit erythrocytes. DM--CD leads to echinocytes. difference is ascribed to the cavity size of the CDs and their ability to extract either sphingomyelin and/or cholesterol of lipid rafts. cytotoxicity of native, methylated, and hydroxypropylated -, -, and -CDs has been studied on an in vitro model of blood-brain barrier by monnaert and co-workers. the results prove that the native CDs are the most toxic (-CD -CD -CD -CD) this apoptosis process results from cholesterol extraction leading to inhibition of the activation of PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway. this differential effect could be attributed to a dissimilarity of interaction between the methylated CDs with the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and with the sphingomyelin-rich domains for DM--CD. lipid efflux mediated by CDs is clearly different from those of surfactants. at low concentrations, the mechanism involves the penetration of the detergent molecules into the lipid membrane leading to increase its fluidity. at higher concentrations, the extraction of membrane constituents is ensured by micellar solubilization. CDs caused the precipitation of lipoproteins in the order -CD -CD -CD. this behavior could be ascribed to the formation of inclusion complexes. the presented data did not exclude the formation of exclusion complexes. pentapeptides containing Tyr with -CD increased in order -CD -CD. stability constants of free Tyr increased in order -CD -CD. authors suggest binding of HP-- and ME--CD. carboxymethyl--CD (CM--CD) in the electrophoretic medium (aqueous buffer solution, pH 2.5) enhanced the separation in capillary zone electrophoresis of standard proteins such as -chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome c, lysozyme and ribonuclease A. however, only certain CDs can be used as selectivity enhancers. some CD molecules persist in binding to the side chains of Trp residues to retard the renaturation of lysozyme. scheme 3 suggests that the effect of CD is directly linked to its ability to complex Trp. binding constants are always weaker with modified -CD than functionalized -CD. -CD binds to aromatic residues of thaumatin with a binding constant of 8.5 M1. as the active binding site of thaumatin is known, the authors have synthesized a heptapeptide (Lys-Thr-Gly-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe) that mimics this binding site. carbonyl group, by oxidation of at least one functional group at the end of the chain in carboxylic acid, is called carbohydrates. carbohydrates are, with proteins and lipids, essential constituents of living organisms because they are key biological intermediates for energy storage. polysaccharides serve also as structural components: cellulose for plants and chitin for arthropods. binding constants of bound sugar and OH groups of -CD were not complexed. these binding constants can be directly correlated to the hydrophobicity of the sugar. this magnitude is consistent with the order of magnitude of the sugar hydrophobicity scale determined by Janado and Yano in 1985. this hydrophobicity scale is corroborated by Wei and Pohorille for the hexose series. nucleic acids allow the synthesis of proteins their modifications result in numerous consequences. the interactions between native CDs and nucleic acids are still a subject of intense discussion along the past years. the obtained anthryl(alkylamino)--CD was used as chemically switched DNA intercalator. however, as the anthryl residue is locked in the CD cavity, its intercalation into DNA is not possible in aqueous solution. this behavior was clearly established from 1H NMR spectroscopy. -CDs are known to have a high affinity for sterols as compared to other lipids [58,115] since the nineties, -CDs are known to have a high affinity, in vitro, for sterols as compared to other lipids [58,115]. -CDs can be used to manipulate the cellular cholesterol content, to modify cholesterol metabolism and to stimulate the removal of cholesterol from a variety of cells in culture. the kinetics of cholesterol transfer indicates that the transbilayer flip-flop of cholesterol is very rapid (halftime 1\u20132 min at 37 \u00b0C) the transfer revealed that cholesterol interacts with markedly higher affinity with sphingolipids than with other membrane phospholipids. authors investigated the cholesterol movement created by the treatment of human erythrocytes with Me--CD. the rate of efflux is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than the cholesterol transfer from cells to synthetic vesicles. the reverse cholesterol transport, RCT, could be used to block atheroprogression associated with different severity degrees of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. -CD, but not its cholesterol complex, inhibits CD11b activation. -CD, but not its cholesterol complex, inhibits CD11b activation. oprotein A-I (ApoA-I) cause a dose-dependent reduction in the activation of CD11b (i.e., anti-inflammatory effect on monocytes) however, the process, which leads to an aberrant accumulation of cholesterol in artery walls forming atherosclerotic plaques, is complex. mice were fed with a cholesterol-rich diet for 12 weeks to promote fatty plaques in their blood vessels. after 8 weeks, they started the injection of HP--CD (2 injections by week) over the remaining four weeks, the authors observed a plaque reduction in atherosclerotic mice that had consumed HP--CD. the cells of the nervous system are also susceptible to cholesterol extraction mediated by CDs. AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which represents 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. this disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain and is often associated to the cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic peptides. CDs have a clear antiviral activity against influenza virus [140], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [141], murine corona virus [142], poliovirus [143], human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) [144], Newcastle virus [145\u2013146], varicella-zoster [147], duck and human hepatitis B virus [148\u2013149], bluetongue virus [150], etc. the anti-HSV properties of native CDs (- and -CD) have been estimated against HSV-1 and HSV-2. -CD exhibited no significant antiherpetic activity, while -CD reduced both the cell-free and cell-associated virus more effectively than acyclovir. the proposed mechanism of the synergy is based on the ability of CD to extract rapidly cholesterol from the viral envelope. -CD catalyzes the rapid exchange of cholesterol between the viral envelope and the aqueous solution. this means that -CD accelerates the rate of cholesterol extraction by a larger factor than - or -CD. the presence of CDs impedes the entry of bacteria, fungi and parasites into host cells. this behavior can be explained by the vital role of the lipid rafts in the binding and the entry of pathogens into host cells. a typical paper has been published in 2001 by leventis and Silvius. the authors examined the catalytic transfer of cholesterol between liposomes. the opposite is true for - and methyl--CD. transfer revealed that cholesterol interacts with markedly higher affinity with sphingolipids than with other membrane phospholipids. kinetics of cholesterol efflux have been examined in different cell lines. a correlation was obtained between the cytotoxicity and the affinity for cholesterol. high concentrations of modified -CDs result in rates of cell cholesterol efflux far in excess of those achieved with physiological cholesterol acceptors such as high-density lipoproteins (HDL) the opposite holds for low-density lipoproteins (LDL) the key step in the formation of atherosclerosis plaque is the recruitment of monocytes (a type of white blood cells), which can differentiate into macrophages and ingest LDL. Murphy et al. proposed to prevent the activation/expression of monocyte adhesion. the authors investigated the effect of different methylated -CDs on the RCT of arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. these two cell types express basal levels of ABCA1 and SR-BI whereas ABCG1 was solely found in arterial endothelial cells. this effect was clearly independent of the membrane composition. -CD increases liver X receptor (LXR) involved in antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects as well as in the RCT improvement. -CD can also be used to reduce LDL cholesterol and alter plasma fatty acid profile. disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. it is often associated to the cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic peptides (A42) this production is mediated by two neuronal enzymes (- and -secretase) which can be inhibited by methylated -CDs via cholesterol depletion. ency virus (HIV-1) [141], murine corona virus [142], poliovirus [143], human hepatitis B virus (HTLV-1) [145\u2013146], varicella-zoster [147], duck and human hepatitis B virus (148\u2013149), bluetongue virus [150], etc. in these cases, the ability of CDs to decrease membrane cholesterol was proposed as antiviral mechanism. however, the biological effects of the CDs can be the results reveal an almost complete protection of Vero cells against acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV. the ability of -CD to impede virus replication is proposed as antiviral mechanism. the potential occurrence of synergistic effects presents a special case. the proposed mechanism of the synergy is based on the ability of CD to extract rapidly cholesterol from the viral envelope. -CD catalyzes the rapid exchange of cholesterol between the viral envelope and the aqueous solution. -CD accelerates the rate of cholesterol extraction by a larger factor than - or -CD. this effect has been demonstrated for Plasmodium species [160], Campylobacter jejuni [161], Leishmania donovani [162] and can be explained by the vital role of the lipid rafts in the binding and the entry of pathogens into host cells. synergistic effects can be obtained for bacteria, fungi and parasites. CDs are bio-sourced compounds with very low toxicity dangers. they can be used alone or in combination with common petro-sourced medications. this is particularly interesting as it solves at least partially the negative impact of pharmaceutical formulations to the environment."}
