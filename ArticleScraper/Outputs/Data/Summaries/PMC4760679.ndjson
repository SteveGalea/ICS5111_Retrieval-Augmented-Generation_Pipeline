{"summary": "the impact of influenza on outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths has not been fully demonstrated to date in south china. the influenza activity in Zhuhai City demonstrated a typical subtropical seasonal pattern. the weekly ILI case number and virus isolation rate had a very close positive correlation (r = 0.774, P 0.0001) influenza-associated hospitalizations is particularly high in children 5 years of age. a population-based study indicated that the burden on young children was mainly derived from outpatients. a high attendance rate, common complications, and immeasurable missed work/absenteeism followed by influenza-associated hospitalizations. death-related disease burden caused by influenza was comparatively low. Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province has a well-established community health and influenza surveillance system. the city has a typical subtropical monsoon climate (annual average temperature, 22.3\u00b0C; annual rainfall, 1770\u20132300 mm) the rate of influenza virus isolation refers to the proportion of influenza virus\u2013positive specimens to the total number of detected specimens. inpatient data were collected monthly from 18 hospitals in the city where inpatient care was provided during 2004\u20132009. only three hospitals provided inpatient data from 2007 to 2009 on a weekly basis. smoothing function was constructed to filter out long-term death trends, seasonality, and other confounding factors that failed measurements. the established core models were as follows [3, 5]: Y t P o i s s o n ( t ) = t V a r ( Y t ) = t log E ( Y t ) = + f ( t ) + q ( z t ). the weekly ILI% and weekly influenza virus isolation rate were selected as indicators reflecting influenza activity. the percentage of influenza-associated excess deaths over the total number of deaths was used to reflect the impact of influenza on mortality. the same model analysis method (GAM) was used to fit the correlation between influenza activity and weekly hospitalizations and outpatient visits. the study complied with the Helsinki Declaration requirements for the use of human subjects. it received approval from the ethics committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province. the study complied with the Helsinki Declaration requirements for the use of human subjects. inpatient data were collected monthly from 18 hospitals in the city where inpatient care was provided during 2004\u20132009. only three hospitals provided inpatient data from 2007 to 2009 on a weekly basis. the citywide death cases were collected during 2006\u20132008. log E ( Y t ) = + f ( t ) + q ( z t ) + q ( z t ) (1) where Yt is the dependent variable, the number of deaths per week; t is the expected mean,Yt; is the over-dispersion parameter (given is equal to 1, the outcome perfectly follows Poisson distribution. weekly ILI% and weekly influenza virus isolation rate were selected as indicators reflecting influenza activity. the percentage of influenza-associated excess deaths over the total number of deaths was used to reflect the impact of influenza on mortality. all data were analyzed anonymously, and any patient identifier was removed in order to maintain patient confidentiality. the total annual number of outpatients in Zhuhai City in 2007\u20132009 showed an obvious increasing trend. the number of ILI cases fluctuated between years, with a weekly average ILI% of 4.6%, 3.3%, and 4.1%, respectively. no.

ILI% means the proportion of cases of influenza-like illness to the total number of hospital admissions. the percentage of excess hospitalizations refer to the proportion of excess hospitalizations for ILI or influenza to the total number of hospital admissions. 610 88 14.4 0.3 Female 409 127 31.1 0.1 Age elders(65 years) 884 181 20.5 0.17 youngers(65years) 142 40 28.2 0.4. of the deaths due to respiratory diseases, 14% were ILI related for males. 89 9.9 18 0 40 13 26 No. positive 1.19 2.1 0 0 8 0 2 Isolation rate (%) 5.29 9.3 0 0 44.44 0 7.8 2008 No. ILI cases 795 312 725 230 1870 617 1010 No. outpatients 24353 4773 24673 10992 33485 21278 28097 ILI/outpatient (%) 3.3 1.1 3 1.7 6.7 2.4 4 No. specimen seasonal influenza A (H1N1), influenza B, pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and untyped influenza viruses. each subtype presented a certain trend of seasonal variation. the prevalence of seasonal influenza A (H1N1) varied by year, with no isolation in 2007. the time series diagram in Fig 2 shows the consistent increasing trend of the weekly ILI case number and the positive isolation rate. Fig 2. Seasonal pattern of influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza by week, 2007\u20132009, Zhuhai City. Approximately 10.7% of outpatient visits were ILI related. the weekly influenza virus positive isolation rate also had a statistically significant influence on the outpatient visits per week. for 6.76% of all hospital admissions, the number of hospital admissions would be reduced by about 7%. there were 470 influenza-associated hospitalizations, accounting for about 1% of all hospital admissions. the impact of ILI on COPD was most significant (P 0.05), with 33.1% of COPD-related deaths due to ILI. no. excess deaths Percentage of excess deaths (%) P value Cause of death All respiratory disease 1019 177 17.4 0.23 COPD* 472 156 33.1 0.03 Others 547 28 5.1 0.82 Sex Male 610 88 14.4 0.3 Female 409 127 31.1 0.1 Age elders(65 years) 884 181 20.5 0. influenza monitoring in Zhuhai city during 2007\u20132009 showed year-round local pathogen activity. but different subtypes of influenza virus showed inconsistent epidemic peaks. this suggests that the active period of transmission of a specific influenza virus should be considered in the timing of influenza vaccination. the impact of influenza on pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was more significant in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Singapore. a related study in Zhuhai City has not been performed. the mortality rate recorded in the death database is likely lower than the real situation for the following reasons. four percent of outpatient visits were attributable to ILI. 7% of hospitalized patients\u2019 diseases were associated with ILI. 17% of respiratory disease deaths were related to ILI. if detailed data of hospitalization cases can be obtained, the disease burden of influenza can be analyzed. if detailed data of hospitalization cases can be obtained, the disease burden of influenza can be analyzed."}
