{"summary": "nearly a quarter of the estimated 52.8 million deaths worldwide were attributed to infectious diseases. in 2010, nearly a quarter of the estimated 52.8 million deaths worldwide were attributed to infectious diseases. in an era of globalized travel and trade, the rise of emergent and re-emergent infectious diseases in several parts of the world are further causes of concern. the topic comprises 4 credits of the Integrated Pharmacy Care and Patient Management modules. the primary focus in these courses is on diseases and infections widely encountered by pharmacists in the united states, with limited exposure to emerging infectious diseases. a discussion-based format focused on examination of the primary literature would make it a truly interactive course. learners met for 3 hours per week, and a designated learner led a discussion on a topic and related clinical or research article. the discussion revolved around one or more of the following: the pathogenesis, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention, and control of the disease. a complete list of disease topics, including the literature used for discussion and instructional materials, is provided in Table 2. learners in the first cohort performed well in all the assessment categories, all achieving a final grade of A in the course. learners in the second cohort performed well in all the assessment categories, all achieving a final grade of A in the course. learners were assessed on preparation for the journal article discussion and their ability to lead the discussion (20% of grade) specific criteria included knowledge and comprehension of the topic, ability to critique journal articles and research studies, and the manner in which learners promoted class discussion. learners were required to write a paper within 3 weeks of having led a research article discussion (20% of grade) paper included a brief overview of the question posed, pertinent background material, and an objective and study design describing how to test the hypothesis. paper had to include an interpretation of potential outcomes including potential pitfalls. learners in both cohorts performed well in this assessment category. the fourth assessment category (5% of the grade) was a peer evaluation of classmates\u2019 oral presentations. the final examination was meant to test learners on how well they had honed their critical-thinking skills. the study received institutional review board approval. all learners who responded indicated the course was stimulating and intellectually challenging. the instructional materials increased their understanding, and the course helped them develop stronger critical-thinking skills. the design of the course helped raise learners\u2019 awareness levels. many learners had never heard of some of the diseases covered in the course. many learners had never heard of some of the diseases covered in the course. some learners had difficulties coming up with potential pitfalls in their study designs. the final examination was helpful in putting the course into perspective. the 5 assessment categories were developed to achieve learning outcomes. learners were required to propose a novel hypothesis or study design. outcomes 1 and 5 also were emphasized during oral presentations. learners were required to design a study surveying the use of antibiotics. a study of the public conducted after the september 11 terrorist attacks was conducted in the united states. they indicated that public health officials may face several challenges to compliance, including misinformation about the contagiousness of inhalation anthrax. pharmacists could provide handouts in their communities regarding \u201cfacts about inhalation anthrax\u201d and the \u201cefficacy of antibiotics\u201d elective course offered PharmD learners the opportunity to learn about emerging infectious diseases and critically review the literature related to such diseases. the format is now used in an Immunology course and the Infectious Disease modules."}
