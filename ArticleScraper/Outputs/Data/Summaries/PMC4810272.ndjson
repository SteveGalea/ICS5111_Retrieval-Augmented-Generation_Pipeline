{"summary": "the Picornaviridae family is composed of 29 genera, including Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Kunsagivirus, Enterovirus, Hepatovirus and Sicinivirus. despite the diversity of picornaviruses, their genome structures and translation processes are highly conserved. the viral genome contains one open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein comprising a structural protein P1 region. the 5\u2032NTR consists of a cloverleaf structure and a type II internal ribosome entry site. the open reading frame encodes a single polyprotein comprising the structural protein P1 region and the non-structural protein P2 and P3 regions. in this review, we discuss the roles that 3Cpro plays in the host cells. a flexible surface loop, called the ribbon, has been observed in several picornaviral 3Cpros, including those of HRV (12 residues), PV (12 residues), and HAV (21 residues) the -ribbon folds over the peptide-binding groove of the enzyme and accommodates a portion of the N-terminal peptide substrate. catalytic residues in HAV include Cys-172 as a nucleophile and His-44 as a general base to form a Cys-His dyad [18]. Arg39 residue is conserved among CVB3, simian enterovirus (SEV) and FMDV 3Cpro. a conserved substitution of R39K is present in the 3Cpro of porcine enterovirus (PEV) the 3Cpro of FMDV exhibits some variability at P1\u2019, but the probability of P1-Gln or P1-Glu is similar. the 3Cpro of HAV can tolerate a large residue at P1\u2032 and exhibits a preference for a small hydrophilic residue at P2 [21]. the separation of capsid proteins from replication proteins is mediated by ribosome skipping at the Asn-Pro-Gly-Pro site. 3Cpro presents in all picornaviruses, and is responsible for almost all secondary cleavages. cleavage at VP2-VP3 and VP3-VP1 can be accomplished more efficiently by 3CDpro than 3Cpro. the hepatovirus VP1-2A cleavage can be achieved by a host cell proteinase (green arrow) the picornavirus family synthesize positive- and negative-stranded RNA by relying on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. there are three RNA structures in the genome, which are important for RNA replication in PV. 3B33C and 3B1233C precursors of FMDV can serve as uridylylation substrates. 3\u2032NTR-poly tail is important for RNA replication. 3\u2032NTR-poly (A) tail is important for RNA replication. 3Cpro and 3CDpro interact with 3B, 3Dpol and 3CD to initiate RNA synthesis. cleavage of PCBP2 by 3CDpro may provide mechanism for RNA replication. proteolytic processing of the C-terminal end of 3Cpro may cause the switch of activities from 3CDpro to 3Cpro to modulate functions during the virus cycle. 3Cpro plays a major role in regulating translation and replication by binding to RNA sequences. 3Cpro presents in all picornaviruses, and is responsible for almost all secondary cleavages. cleavage at VP2-VP3 and VP3-VP1 can be accomplished more efficiently by 3CDpro than 3Cpro [26,27,28]. a cloverleaf-like structure in the 5\u2032-NCR of the viral RNA (5\u2032CL) is important for RNA replication in PV. a cloverleaf-like structure in the 5\u2032-NCR of the viral RNA (5\u2032CL) is important for RNA replication. 3\u2032NTR-poly (A) tail is important for RNA replication. interaction between 3CD, poly (A) binding-protein (PABP) and the poly (A) tail is required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. there are three distinct regions within 3Cpro: the N-terminal region (K12 and R13), a central region (KFRDI86) and the C-terminal region (T153, G154 and K155) the mechanism by which 3Cpro is involved in RNA synthesis is closely related to its RNA-binding activity. cleavage of host factors by 3Cpro in picornaviruses greatly alters several processes that are critical for cell viability. cleavage of host factors by 3Cpro in picornaviruses greatly alters several processes that are critical for cell viability, including transcription, initiation of protein synthesis and nucleocytoplasmic transport. t Cell Protein Virus Functions Cleavage Site Reference I TAF110 PV Regulates of transcriptional initiation IQLQ265...ACAQ805G [49] II TBP PV Involved in three RNA polymerase-mediated transcriptions and responsible for DNA binding AAAVQQ104STSQQA [50] CREB-1 PV Binds to the octamer sequence ATGCAAAT and activates the promoters of genes for some small nuclear eIFs, including eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5 and the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA), together with the 40S ribosomal subunit. the binding of eIF4F to the cap and the binding of PABP to the poly (A) tail circularizes the mRNA to activate the mRNA. the 43S ribosome then binds near the cap and scans the aviruses take advantage of the IRES element to recruit ribosomal subunits for initiation [58]. assembly of 48S initiation complexes on IRES elements of types I and II (FMDV and EMCV) requires eIF3, eIF4A and the C-terminal end of eIF4G. 3Cpro plays a significant role by cleaving some eIFs and ITAFs to guarantee the internal initiation of translation. cleavage of cellular factors and inhibition of their expression may explain this phenomenon. the picornaviral proteinases, L, 2A and 3Cpro, have been reported to function in the cleavage of host translation initiation factors (eIFs) a study of EMCV 3Cpro suggests that specific PABP cleavage is required for virus replication or that full-length PABP is not absolutely required for virus replication. the cleavage of Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins (G3BP1) may be induced by 3Cpro to facilitate viral replication after CVB3 infection. the 2Apro and 3Cpro viral proteinases of enteroviruses are responsible for the specific proteolysis of Nup 62, Nup 98, and Nup 153. the leader protein of cardioviruses induces hyper-phosphorylation of nup 62, Nup 98, and Nup 214. a low concentration of 2Apro can lead to nup 98 degradation in cells. induction of cell death Picornaviral 3Cpro can induce apoptosis through cleavage of transcription and translation initiation factors that control cell survival and death pathways. p53 is degraded by 3Cpro with cellular activity. e 8-mediated activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of Bid. only 3Cpro can upregulate Bax and release cytochrome c from mitochondria. cell death is necessary for the release of virus. PV 3Cpro enters the nucleus via precursors and induces the cleavage of RNA polymerases to shut off host cell transcription. cAMP response element-binding protein-1 (CREB-1), octamer binding protein-1 (Oct-1), p53 and transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) can also interrupt transcription by cleaving nuclear histone H3, and EV71 3Cpro can also cleave CstF64 of the m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)N structure is recognized by a translation initiation factor (eIF4F) the 43S preinitiation complex contains eIFs, including eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5 and the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) the 43S ribosome then binds near the cap and scans the 5\u2032-UTR for an AUG codon. mRNA of FMDV employs a type II internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit the 40S subunit to start translation. some eIFs and ITAFs are required for IRES-driven translational initiation. eIF4A I FMDV Binds capped mRNA to the 40S ribosome. unwinds double-stranded RNA CIGGTNVRAE143VQKLQMEA [63] eIF4G I FMDV Brings mRNA to the 40S ribosome in translation initiation. transient expression assays have shown that eIF4A and eIF4G can be cleaved when FMDV 3Cpro is expressed. cleavage by 3Cpro is different from that by the FMDV leader protein and 2Apro [61]. gene-binding proteins (G3BP1) can be cleaved by 3Cpro of FMDV. this allows 3Cpro to redistribute Sam68 to the cytoplasm. it is speculated that Sam68 plays a supportive role in the virus life cycle. expression of 3Cpro or 3CD in HRV 16 causes degradation of nup 98. cleavage of nup 62 is partially induced in vitro by a high concentration of purified HRV 3C. induction of cell death Picornaviral 3Cpro can induce apoptosis through cleavage of transcription and translation initiation factors. expression of poliovirus 3Cpro results in degradation of cellular DNA and generation of apoptotic bodies. p53 can also function in the cytosol and mitochondria to promote apoptosis by transcription-independent mechanisms. the 3Cpros of PV and FMDV have been reported to mediate cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 4(MAP-4) and cause disruption of the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) some scholars have studied the connection between Golgi fragmentation, microtubule depolymerization and secretion blockade. all TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins composed of a leucine-rich N-terminal of an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a linker to a cytoplasmic C-terminal Toll-interleukin-I receptor homology domain. when toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA, it recruits TIR domain-containing adapter inducing interferon- ( EV71 3Cpro induces TRIF cleavage to inhibit NF-B and IFN- promoter activation in a caspase-independent manner [107]. role for the viral proteinases 2Apro and 3Cpro as antagonists has been ruled out. polymerase PARP9 and the DTX3L E3 ubiquitin ligase can promote STAT1-mediated ISG expression and can induce viral 3Cpro degradation. the mechanisms by which picornaviruses inhibit cellular type I IFN and the strategies by which host cells adopt a defense system are complicated. the protease activities of 3Cpro and the transmembrane domain of 3A are both necessary for the proteolysis of MAVS [112,113] for another precursor, HAV 3CD protease-polymerase disrupts TLR3 signaling by degrading TRIF. 3Cpro downregulates miR-526a to suppress the innate immune response. a novel model shows that CVB3 manipulates transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) to regulate viral pathogenesis. a pathophysiological link between TDP-43 and ALS has been established. studies of 3Cpro and TDP-43 will provide information regarding pathogenesis of CV. the development of effective immune evasion mechanisms is beneficial to viral infection. the activity spectra of the 3Cpro inhibitors AG7088 and SG85 have been found to include inhibition of CVB3, EV71, PV, and HRV14 3Cpros. however, these inhibitors have no effect on the 3Cpro of EMCV [131,132] 3Cpro, 3CLpro and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) encoded by the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae families, are necessary for virus replication. a modified AG7088 shows good inhibition of 3CLpro and no inhibition of 3Cpro. the natural product ()-thysanone has been reported to inhibit HRV 3Cpro with an IC50 value of 47 M. the 2-methylene analogue of ()-thysanone has lost the capacity to inhibit HRV 3Cpro. a potent irreversible inhibitor of HRV 3Cpro contains an,-unsaturated ester at P1\u2032 that serves as a Michael acceptor, a lactam ring at P1, a fluoro-phenylalanine at P2, a Val at P3 and a 5-methyl-3-isoxazole. the inhibition of HAV replication by AG7088 is strain-dependent. interaction between cyanohydrins moiety and 3Cpro catalytic site exhibits high selectivity and improved inhibitory activity. 3Cpro and 3CLpro share a typical chymotrypsin-like fold, an extended binding site, a Cys-His-Glu/Asp catalytic triad (EV, CV 3Cpro and NV 3Cpro) and a cleavage preference at the Gln-Gly junction. the natural product ()-thysanone has been reported to inhibit HRV 3Cpro with an IC50 value of 47 M. the 2-methylene analogue of ()-thysanone has lost the capacity to inhibit HRV 3Cpro. 3Cpro and the 3CD precursor are involved in many steps of gene expression to hijack cellular resources and to generate an optimal intracellular environment for the virus life cycle. 3Cpro induces cell death through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways but also mediates fragmentation of MAP-4 and the Golgi apparatus. the development of irreversible inhibitors and the discovery of non-covalent inhibitors of 3Cpro will accelerate the treatments for picornaviruses and other viruses encoding 3CLpro. 3Cpro is well known to be a crucial proteinase for processing polyprotein and RNA-binding protein in viral replication."}
