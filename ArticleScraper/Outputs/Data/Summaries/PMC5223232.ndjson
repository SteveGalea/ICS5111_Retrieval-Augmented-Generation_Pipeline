{"summary": "coronavirus strains HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and lineage A betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection. in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betacoronavirus, was identified and infected more than 8 000 persons including nearly 800 related deaths worldwide in the 2002-2003 the S1 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion loop and two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) which suggest a coiled helix structure of the S2 subunit7. previous studies suggested that three S monomers assemble to form homo-trimer spikes anchoring on the outmost viral envelope16. cryo-EM structure determination of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer in four different conformations. these conformations are different in the position of one C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1), which functions as the RBD of the S glycoprotein trimer. a \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d positional change of the CTD1 switches the S glycoprotein trimer from receptor-binding inactive to active state. the three conformation states are closely three-fold symmetric. the other three conformation states show significant asymmetric features in the mushroom head region. further calculation and processing were performed with C3 symmetry imposed for the symmetric conformation 1. SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer conformation 1 In the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, the -strand-rich S1 subunit is composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 14-294) and three C-terminal domains (CTD1, residues 320-516; CTD2, residues 517-578 and CTD3, residues 579-663; Figure 1A and 1B) the atomic model of the S2 subunit includes the functionally important fusion peptide (residues 798-815) and HR1 (residues 880-967; Figure 1A and 1B) the C-terminal HR2 (residues 1 154-1 183) was not built due to relatively poor density in this region. the tilt angles of the CTD1s are defined by the angle between the long axis of the CTD1 (red cylinder) and its projection on the horizontal plane. the angles between the long axes of the \u201cup\u201d CTD1s and their projections on the horizontal plane have increased to 52, 64 and 70 degrees. the fusion loop is not affected within the monomer where the CTD1 adopts an \u201cup\u201d conformation. the CTD2 may become more liable to undergo conformational changes to expose the fusion loop underneath. asymmetric conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding activate state of the spike. three CTD1s are all in the \u201cdown\u201d conformation. the steric clashes between a neighboring CTD1 (grey) and ACE2 (green) are colored blue. the same model as in A with the S trimer density map presented. neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1 (m339, 80R and F26G19) have shown potent inhibition activity against the cell infection of pseudo-typed or live SARS-CoV. the antibody binding epitopes have been elucidated by crystal structure determination of the antibody-CTD1 complexes29,30,31. the \u201cbound\u201d Fab are colored blue and the corresponding volumes are shown in bracket. structural superimpositions of three CTD1-antibody complex structures with the S trimer in conformation 3. no steric clashes between the \u201cbound\u201d Fab and the S trimer. the three protomers are colored pink, yellow and cyan, respectively. the resolution of the final C3 symmetric conformation 1 calculated with 34 152 particles was 4.3. the atomic model of the S2 subunit includes the functionally important fusion peptide (residues 798-815) and HR1 (residues 880-967; Figure 1A and 1B). the NTD is connected to the CTD1 through a long linker (residues 295-319; Figure 1A and 1B). the triangular head of the trimer spike is composed of the NTDs and CTD1s of three S1 subunits. the stem of the trimer spike consists of a core helix bundle formed by the long helices of three S2 subunits. the core helix bundle is further surrounded by CTD2s and CTD3s of three S1 subunits. three other conformations 2-4 showed asymmetric features of the CTD1 in the triangular head. in the symmetric conformation 1, the CTD1s in the head are all in a \u201cdown\u201d position, covering the S2 subunits in the stem. the angle between the long axis of the CTD1 and its projection on the horizontal plane perpendicular to the 3-fold axis is 19 degree. 1 specifically binds to the cellular receptor ACE2, which is a prerequisite for the host cell attachment of the virion and the subsequent membrane fusion18,28. for conformation 1 in which all CTD1s are in the \u201cdown\u201d positions, numerous steric clashes were observed between ACE2 and neighboring CTD1. three CTD1s are all in the \u201cdown\u201d conformations. the clashes between a neighboring CTD1 (grey) and ACE2 (green) are colored blue. only the boundary profile of the \u201cbound\u201d ACE2 is shown. clashes with other regions of the S glycoprotein trimer in conformation 1 state. the steric clashes with the \u201cbound\u201d Fab are colored blue. the steric clashes with the \u201cbound\u201d Fab are colored blue. most studies have focused on the RBD (NTD or CTD1) of the S1 subunit because it binds to the host receptors and is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. recently reported cryo-EM structures of the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers are similar to the conformation 1 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer. the protein receptor-binding site in the CTD1 has also been confirmed for MERS-CoV and bat coronavirus HKU4. the protein receptor-binding site in the CTD1 has also been confirmed for MERS-CoV and bat coronavirus HKU4 which are lineage C betacoronaviruses. a human codon-optimized gene coding the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (NCBI Accession NP_828851.1) residues 1-1 195 with an R667A mutation to enhance sample homogeneity. a C-terminal strep tag for purification was cloned and inserted into pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen) the high-titer the grids were blotted and then plunged into liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot. each image was fractionated into 32 movie frames with a total exposure time of 8 s and at a dose rate of 8 counts per physical pixel per second. 4 015 particles were manually picked and 2D classifications were performed using RELION 1.341. all 2D and 3D classifications and refinements were performed using RELION 1.4. auto-picked particles were visually inspected and then selected by several rounds of reference-free 2D classifications. the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein RBD (or CTD1, residues 324-502, PDB accession code: 3D0G) and the structures of HKU1 S glycoprotein (PDB accession code: 5i08), CTD2 (residues 596-673), CTD3 (residues 674-771) and S2 domain (residues 793-1147) were initially fitted into the SARS-Co models of the three asymmetric conformations were built by fitting the symmetric model of SARS-CoV S into the density maps using UCSF Chimera. models were then refined as rigid bodies in real space using PHENIX. the overlap score is defined as the sum of two VDW (van der Waals) radii minus the distance between them. the volume of the steric clashes was calculated using UCSF Chimera \u201cmeasure volume\u201d command. SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was captured by StrepTactin Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 10 mM D-desthiobiotin in binding buffer. eluted protein was then purified by gel filtration chromatography. UCSFImage4 was used for all data collection37. Image processing The image processing procedures were summarized in Supplementary information, Figure S2A. the final density maps were 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 for the three classes. the handedness of the maps was verified by docking the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein CTD1 into the maps. the atom coordinates of the model (including CTD1, CTD2, CTD3 and S2) were randomly displaced by 0.5 using PHENIX PDB tools. the model was refined against one of the two half maps in reciprocal space using PHENIX. no big gaps were observed between the work and test FSC curves. the horizontal plane of the S perpendicular to the 3-fold axis and the long axis of the CTD1 were generated using the UCSF Chimera \u201cangle\u201d command. the angle between the axis and the plane was calculated using the UCSF Chimera \u201cangle\u201d command. the overlap volumes between the fitted receptor and the S spike were also calculated using UCSF Chimera.
