{"summary": "in the 20th century, methods for virus detection, characterization and taxonomical classification were established, that helped in the discovery of a number of important viruses. by the late 1950s, it was generally believed that most of the human pathogenic viruses had been discovered, but the emergence of a number of previously unknown viruses strongly challenged this belief[1]. this change has led to increased exposure of different human populations to newer pathogens. rapid identification and characterization of viruses in clinical samples is extremely essential to facilitate prevention and quarantine strategies. this article will review the gradual evolution and recent advances in the field of virus discovery. this article will review the gradual evolution and recent advances in the field of virus discovery. the requirement of cell culture based traditional methods became obsolete to a large extent. cleic acid sequence-dependent techniques led to the discovery of several new genotypes of known viruses. this technique was tolerant to considerable sequence variation, but lacked its original sensitivity. er amplification (SISPA), virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), etc., led to the discovery of different viruses, including human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1, Torque Teno virus, different Parvoviruses, Coronaviruses, Polyomaviruses, Hepatitis C virus, Sin Nombre virus, and human Herpesviruses 6 and 8, and West Nile virus. a comparative evaluation of the different virus discovery approaches shows advantages and disadvantages associated with them Classical approaches(Cell culture and infection based) Nucleic acid sequence-dependent amplification approaches Nucleic acid sequence-independent amplification approaches Next-generation sequencers-based metagenomic approaches Requirement of cell culture systems Yes, required for virus particle enrichment Not required Not required Not required Not required Not required Information about detailed virus features. other pathogens capable of infecting cell Being sequence dependent. more vulnerable to other sequences from host and other pathogens. Virus enrichment techniques required before analysis. nucleic acid sequence-dependent amplification approaches to virus discovery became obsolete to a large extent. the requirement of cell culture based traditional methods became obsolete to a large extent[13-16]. these techniques led to the discovery of several new genotypes of known viruses, but not appropriate for absolutely novel viruses. a number of random amplification techniques for viral metagenomics led to the discovery of different viruses, including human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1, Torque Teno virus, different Parvoviruses, Coronaviruses, Polyomaviruses, Hepatitis C virus, Sin Nombre virus, human Herpesviruses 6 and 8, and West Nile virus, etc., in clinical samples[21,20,22]. analysis of viral evolution and quasispecies analysis, antiviral resistance, vaccine, etc. is presented in Table 1. a comparative evaluation of the different virus discovery approaches showing advantages and disadvantages associated with them Classical approaches(Cell culture and infection based) technique, no information is required Dynamic detection range Very narrow Narrow Wide Extremely wide Tolerance to non-viral materials Vulnerable to other pathogens capable of infecting cell Being sequence dependent, less vulnerable to other sequences from host and other pathogens. Virus enrichment techniques required before analysis Being sequence in-dependent, more vulnerable to other sequences from host and other pathogens. despite its wide use for sequencing pure templates, this sequence method was constrained by its low throughput, higher cost, time and labor involved in sequencing larger genomes. despite its wide use for sequencing pure templates, complete dependence on specific primers, inability to sequence the genetic material from a mix of diverse organisms severely restricted its use for direct metagenomic applications. a typical NGS run generates several hundred megabases (Mb) to gigabases (Gb) of nucleotide sequence data, depending on the platform. a typical NGS run generates several hundred megabases (Mb) to gigabases (Gb) of nucleotide sequence data, depending on the platform. long reads are extremely useful for de novo read assembly and generation of longer contigs. yrosequencing, utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry and chemiluminescence is detected to achieve nucleotide sequence. this method amplifies DNA through an emulsion PCR, generating clones of DNA using a single template. the main benefit of this technology is its ability to produce long reads while restricted by its high error rate in homopolymers containing regions. third-generation sequencers are distinct from their predecessors in two primary features: template amplification is not needed prior to sequencing, which cuts down template preparation time; and cost (2) the signal is registered in real time, directly, during the enzymatic reaction. the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine is based on a semiconductor based sequencing technology. single large DNA molecules can be sequenced with high processivity of up to 7 kb, with average read lengths of 3-4 kb[23,61]. nanopore sequencing is another recently developed method of the third-generation sequencing[62,63]. nanopore is a tiny biopore with diameter in nanoscale, and involves a heptameric transmembrane channel -haemolysin (HL) pyrosequencing technology (Roche 454) is preferred over the other NGS approaches producing shorter reads. the new investigators have alternative NGS platforms available today. despite its wide use for sequencing pure templates, this sequence method was constrained by its low throughput, higher cost, time and labor involved in sequencing larger genomes. despite its wide use for sequencing pure templates, complete dependence on specific primers, inability to sequence the genetic material from a mix of diverse organisms severely restricted its use for direct metagenomic applications. a typical NGS run generates several hundred megabases (Mb) to gigabases (Gb) of nucleotide sequence data, depending on the platform. long reads are extremely useful for de novo read assembly and generation of longer contigs, which endow with improved statistical power of finding related sequences in nucleotide database searches. 454 sequencing platforms are based on parallel pyrosequencing. using sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry and chemiluminescence is detected to achieve nucleotide sequence. this method amplifies DNA through an emulsion PCR, generating clones of DNA using a single template. the main benefit of this technology is its ability to produce long reads. technology known as the SOLiD technology (by Life Technologies) is commercially available. its representation in the scientific literature is limited compared to Roche 454 and Illumina, which might be attributable to its recent availability or complexity of data processing and assembly. a comparison of the currently available NSG systems is also available at the Genohub website. single large DNA molecules can be sequenced with high processivity of up to 7 kb, with average read lengths of 3-4 kb[23,61]. nanopore sequencing is another recently developed method of the third-generation sequencing[62,63]. nanopore is a tiny biopore with diameter in nanoscale. pyrosequencing technology (Roche 454) is preferred over other NGS approaches producing shorter reads. pyrosequencing technology is preferred over other approaches producing shorter reads. virus enrichment protocols involving physical and enzymatic techniques have been successfully applied for clinical samples. these include virus capsid purification through freeze/thaw cycles of cell disruption, centrifugation, prior nuclease digestion of host genome, etc., followed by extraction of capsid-protected viral nucleic acids. amplification of viral sequences from serum by allander et al[79] and later by others for identification of novel viruses through Sanger sequencing. recently, SISPA-NGS strategy was found to be helpful in detection of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in veterinary samples[84], suggesting the utility of this technique in screening of field animals that are intermediate hosts to many human viruses. viral RNA and ssDNA is transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase (RT) and DNA Pol I respectively. second strand synthesis is performed using DNA Pol I (Klenow) to make the cDNA double stranded (dsDNA) stranded DNA (ssDNA) viral is also converted to dsDNA. dsDNA is digested with a set of frequent cutter restriction endonucleases. anchored dsDNA is amplified with primers annealing to adapter specific sequences. a number of virus enrichment protocols have been successfully applied for clinical samples. these include virus capsid purification through freeze/thaw cycles of cell disruption, centrifugation, prior nuclease digestion of host genome and non-specific PCR amplification. virus enrichment methods are required to be rapid, standardized and undemanding in terms of cost, manpower or instrumentation facility. the sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) was modified for successful amplification of viral sequences from serum by Allander et al[79] and later by others for identification of novel viruses through Sanger sequencing.
