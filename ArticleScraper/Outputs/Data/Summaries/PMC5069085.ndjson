{"summary": "bacterial and viral infections contribute to more than 3 million deaths worldwide annually. pneumonia is the leading cause of death by infection. lipid mediators are generated during infection and then mediate the pulmonary immune response. hydrophobic SP-A and SP-D are collectins, a protein family that recognizes a wide range of PAMPs. they promote opsonization and subsequent killing of pathogens by phagocytic cells in the respiratory tract. cytokine production is initiated by downstream signaling adapters, such as MyD88 and TRIF. the TRIF-mediated pathway in the respiratory epithelium induces type I IFN production (i.e., IFN- and -) in mice lacking the receptor to type I IFN that succumb to infection by influenza virus [20],. the lung has resident populations of hematopoietic cells that patrol the airspace, detecting PAMPs and contributing to the local milieu of cytokines and chemokines. NK cells are innate lymphocytes that contribute to first line of defense against infection. NK cells are widely distributed in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. macrophages and DCs provide a key bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. M1 macrophages are characterized by the production of ROS, reactive nitrogen intermediates, IL-1, IL-12, and TNF- [39, 40]. the macrophage subset regulates wound healing, restores tissue homeostasis, and also antagonizes proinflammatory M1 macrophage responses with an M2 wound-healing phenotype. CD4+ Th cells assist B cells to mount antibody secretion, provide feedback to DCs via costimulatory molecules and the elaboration of cytokines. CD4+ T cells have direct effector actions, including performing cytotoxic functions, mediating macrophage activation, and inducing genes in mucosal tissues that contribute to host defense. a fraction of these T cells retain a memory phenotype, which is important in the recall response during infection. memory T cells share epitope specificity and T cell receptor sequences with the effector T cell subsets and have stem cell-like characteristics. surfactant contains 80\u201390% PLs, with fatty acid chains that can be oxidized during different challenges in the lung. PLs can be oxidized into a variety of species, including 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6) epoxyisoprostane E2-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PEIPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho the increase in oxPL levels has been well characterized in diseases associated with chronic inflammation. it is unclear what the primary source of increased oxPLs is during pulmonary infections. one could speculate that an increase in cellular apoptosis, an increase in ROS by phagocytic cells, and changes in surfactant from pulmonary inflammation are major contributors. scavenger receptors such as macrophage receptor with collagenous structure may induce TLR4-dependent proinflammatory cytokines. oxPLs are recognized by multiple PRRs, including macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), SR-A, CD36, SR-BI, platelet activating factor receptor, prostaglandin receptors, and TLRs. oxPAPC inhibits cytokine production after oxPAPC stimulation. oxPLs have also been reported to have dampening effects on cytokine production. oxPLs can exert pro- and anti-inflammatory effects during innate immune response. oxPL-dependent defects in phagocytosis and ROS generation may lead to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. oxPL-dependent defects in phagocytosis and ROS generation may lead to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. defENSE Cholesterol is the major neutral lipid in pulmonary surfactant. it is thought to promote the spread, mobility, and adsorption of surfactant films. most of the cholesterol in the lung derives from uptake of circulating plasma lipoproteins. the HDL receptor SR-BI serves as a host cell receptor for HCV [99] and Niemann-Pick C1, an endosomal cholesterol transporter, was recently identified as the cellular receptor for Ebola virus [100, 101] recent reports have shown that IFN-dependent downregulation of the mevalonic acid pathway is an intrinsic feature of the antiviral host defense response. oxidation of the carbon 5-6 double bond of the ring of cholesterol by ROS is likely a common event for pulmonary surfactant cholesterol in the setting of inhaled oxidants such as ozone [105] several enzymes are known to add hydroxyl groups to the side chain carbons of cholesterol (i.e., carbons 20\u201327), yielding side chain oxysterols that have pleiotropic bioactivity. 25HC is a potent antiviral molecule that suppresses virus through inhibiting host cell fusion. its complex effects in host defense and inflammation are likely highly relevant to human disease. additional oxysterols have been shown to have key roles in immunity. long chain n-3 PUFAs have emerged as potential regulators of inflammation. long chain n-3 PUFAs are essential fatty acids obtained from marine sources. they can also be generated upon elongation and desaturation from short chain n-3 PUFAs. EPA and DHA were used to elucidate their role in lung homeostasis. we then discuss potential molecular mechanisms of EPA and DHA in the context of infection and inflammation. n-3 PUFAs improve pulmonary outcomes associated with infection. n-3 PUFA administration has beneficial effects through pleiotropic mechanisms. some studies showed negative effects of select n-3 PUFAs on pulmonary outcomes. n-3 PUFA administration to mice in an asthma model led to increased levels of eosinophils and IL-6 in BAL fluid. the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs at the clinical level is under investigation. in a randomized controlled trial, Hecker et al. showed that BAL fluid from individuals inhaled LPS and were given n-3 PUFAs showed decreased proinflammatory cytokines from PMNs and monocytes compared to controls. n-3 PUFA administration suppressed PMN infiltration in lung tissue of mice with polymicrobial sepsis. n-3 PUFAs target innate and adaptive immunity in pulmonary inflammation. key roles for EPA and DHA remain elusive. some studies have shown that Th2 cytokines are elevated by n-3 PUFAs, while others show the opposite. n-3 PUFAs increased IL-5 and -13 while lowering oxidative stress. n-3 PUFAs in mice stimulated with ovalbumin to promote lung inflammation. n-3 PUFAs target cellular signaling pathways that converge on multiple targets, thereby influencing gene expression and cell fate. n-3 PUFAs are likely to vary between individuals because of differences in genetic variations of key enzymes involved in PUFA biosynthesis and metabolism. n-3 PUFAs are potent molecules that aid in the resolution of inflammation. resolvin D1, synthesized from DHA, lowers lung inflammation in a model of cigarette smoking [170] but it remains unclear whether pharmacologic intake of EPA or DHA leads to increased levels of SPMs in vivo. n-3 PUFAs improved inflammatory markers in lung homogenates and bacterial loads in the lungs. these studies suggest a potential beneficial role of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in inflammation associated with infection. some studies showed negative consequences of select n-3 PUFAs on pulmonary outcomes. the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs at the clinical level is under investigation. a review of observational studies between n-3 PUFAs and COPD revealed no strong relationship for improved prevalence and severity of outcomes in COPD. n-3 PUFAs target innate and adaptive immunity in pulmonary inflammation. EPA and DHA target receptors such as GPR120 and TLR4, potentially through modification of lipid raft architecture, to influence key immune responses. key roles for EPA and DHA remain elusive. n-3 PUFAs boost B-cell activation and antibody production in response to ex vivo or in vivo stimulation [153] n-3 PUFAs suppress Th1/Th17 activation through direct effects on CD4+ T cells or indirectly through dampening of Ag presentation by APCs through MHCII [154\u2013157] the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention on Th2 cytokines remains unclear. n-3 PUFAs target cellular signaling pathways that converge on multiple targets, thereby influencing gene expression and cell fate. some studies have begun to demonstrate the relevance of n-3 PUFA-regulated signaling to lung pathology. genetic variants in the fatty acid desaturase cluster may be responsible for differences in n-3 PUFA levels between individuals of African and European descent. extensive studies on PUFA\u2013gene interactions are needed in the context of lung pathology to effectively translate n-3 PUFAs to clinical trials. the lung influence the myriad of responses in innate and adaptive immunity. it will be centrally important to understand how these mediators, singly and in combination, modify the pulmonary immune response."}
