{"summary": "microbial aetiology is vital to confirm whether causal pathogen frequencies have changed to guide empirical antibiotic therapy strategies. patients infected with conventional bacteria such as S. pneumoniae had a higher hospitalization rate, higher CURB65 (disease severity) scores at admission and more adverse clinical outcomes. a prospective cohort of community-acquired pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia were identified in a 28-bed medical intensive care unit. the breakdown was that 35% of patients had a bacterial infection and 36% had a viral infection. bacterial, viral, and bacterial-viral co-infections were similar. cases so far suggest a link with birds as the source with little or no human-to-human spread. Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.7%) was the most common agent, followed by Coxiella burnetii (18.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (15.9%), respiratory viruses (14.4%) and Legionella pneumophila (44.4%). 35% of patients had a bacterial infection and 36% had a viral infection. mortality of patients with bacterial, viral, and bacterial-viral co-infections were similar. lack of pharmacological therapies for most viral causes limits value of this information at the current time. novel coronavirus A recent case report in Saudi Arabia has led to the discovery of a sixth new coronavirus. the patient had pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. this has also been recently referred to as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. the standard scoring methods of the pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB65, and CRB65 showed moderate to good accuracy in predicting 30-day mortality in these patients and risk of death [11]. PSI appeared to have a significant advantage in terms of its negative likelihood ratio. inpatient management CURB65 A higher positive predictive value than the PSI system suggests that CURB65/CRB65 may be superior for identifying high-risk patients in terms of mortality and decisions with regards to admission of high-risk patients. a recent study of the score investigated whether it was useful in patients with lower respiratory tract infection in a primary care setting. the age of 65 was a reasonable threshold for the assessment of the risk of death from community-acquired pneumonia in the total population. the optimal age group for death prediction continued to be 80 (CRB80) in patients aged less than 65 years, death prediction was best below age of 50. procalcitonin with a cut-off point of 0.15 ng/ml was the best predictor for bacterial aetiology and to select patients eligible for outpatient care in another study. they suggested levels of procalcitonin and C reactive protein positively correlate with increasing severity of community-acquired pneumonia. a recent study showed increased serum cortisol level was associated with the development of critical disease and increased 30-day-mortality in hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia-patients. the main limitation of the study was that controlling for the time point of blood sampling could not be done, so diurnal concentration changes may have influenced the results. e) Heart rate > 125 bpm 10 points Add Labs: arterial blood gas (ABG) a) Arterial pH 7.35 30 points Add b) PaO2 60 mmHg (90% O2 SATS) 10 points Add b) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >64 mg/dl 20 points Add c) Chest Xray-pleural effusion 10 points Add Abbreviations: CHF, congestive heart failure; CVA, cerebro the risk of death at 30 days increases as the score increases. 0 points\u20140.7%, 1 point\u20143.2%, 2 points\u201413.0%, 3 points\u201417.0%, 4 points\u201441.5%, 5 points\u201457.0% CURB65-guided antibiotic therapy was associated with a significant decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotic use. the rule is considered positive in the presence of one major or three minor criteria. the ATS minor criteria, S-community-acquired pneumonia score, and SMART-COP have good predictive characteristics for ICU admission [15]. biomarkers Serum glucose A recent predictive cohort study found that an increased serum glucose level at admission to hospital and no pre-existing diabetes was a predictor of death at 28 and 90 days in 6891 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. an admission proADM level of 0.646 nmol correlated in such a fashion that 92% of the 139 patients in PSI classes 4 and 5 would have been correctly classified. proADM may be helpful in individual risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia patients with a high PSI score in the emergency department. ing diabetes was a predictor of death at 28 and 90 days in 6891 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. this paper investigated serum glucose as an independent risk factor in predicting death in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. complications during admission, severity of disease and death within a month correlated with high levels of procalcitonin. IL-6, IL-10 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) correlated best with a CURB65 score of 3 and 4. highest levels of IL-6, IL-10 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) correlated best with a CURB65 score of 3 and 4. score to guide Outpatient treatment Stratify by risk for drug resistant S. pneumoniae Low risk: Treat with macrolide or doxycycline High risk: Treat with: aminopenicillin macrolide Aminopenicillin/b-lactamase inhibitor macrolide Non-antipseudomonal cephalosporin Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone macrolide. Consider ICU for sepsis or >2 minor severity criteria. a score of CURB65 0 or 1 should be reviewed by senior clinicians. patients with CURB65 score of 2 should be considered for hospital admission. a CRB score of 1 or more suggests hospitalisation should be considered. quired pneumonia was associated with a significant 22% reduction in mortality compared to non-macrolides. but this benefit did not extend to randomised controlled trials or patients that received guideline-concordant antibiotics. both studies point towards the need for good adherence to hospital prescribing guidelines. a very careful study came to a verdict that the benefit of dual therapy versus single therapy cannot be reliably assessed. a role for steroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is yet to be proved. a role for steroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is yet to be proved. a role for steroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is yet to be proved. the jury is still out with regards to performance-related programmes. the jury is still out with regards to performance-related programmes. there is a need to develop further randomised controlled trials. severity illness scores such as CURB65 and PSI should be used to identify patients for outpatient management. direct admission to ICU should be made upon factors such as septic shock requiring vasopressor support and/or respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilation. ATS/IDSA These guidelines make it quite clear that severity illness scores such as CURB65 and PSI should be used to identify patients for outpatient management. direct admission to ICU should be made upon factors such as septic shock requiring vasopressor support and/or respiratory failure requiring ventilation. a total of 23 studies with approximately 137,000 patients were included in a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy of macrolides in patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. guideline-concordance may be more important than choice of antibiotic when treating community-acquired pneumonia [28]. the conflicting results from studies in sepsis confirmed the need for community-acquired pneumonia-specific studies. a recent double blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial using 40 mg prednisolone for 7 days found that there were no beneficial effects of adjunctive corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. a randomized controlled trial investigated the implementation of a three-step strategy of early mobilisation. the use of a three-step critical pathway was safe and effective in reducing the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of hospital stay for community-acquired pneumonia patients. the jury is still out with regards to performance-related programmes but there is a need to develop further randomised controlled trials."}
