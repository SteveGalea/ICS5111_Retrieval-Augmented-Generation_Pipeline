{"summary": "the classification of biological agents can be based on two measures: laboratory biosafety and biodefense considerations. the main consideration is the ability of biological agents to cause disease and the risk of exposure in laboratory accidents. for biodefense assessment, the main consideration is the potential for biological agent weaponization, terrorism and the harm associated with deliberate release [1]. the list of human transmission of pathogenic microorganisms was published by the state council in 2004 [7]. group 1 was the highest risk, in contrast to the WHO, NIH and the EU. the threat of biological agents includes naturally occurring infectious diseases. toxins such as ricin, tetrodotoxin, conotoxin, fungi and protozoa were included in some category lists, but are not listed in this study. Biological agents were divided by the WHO, NIH, EU and china into four laboratory biosafety categories. agents that are not associatedwith disease inhealthy adulthumans. one that isunlikely to causehuman oranimal disease. agents that are rarelyserious and for which preventive interventions are available. biological agents biodefense categorization is not as common as laboratory biosafety categorization. group 1 represents the highest threat, unlike the WHO, NIH and EU laboratory biosafety category lists. the development of Biological Agent Biodefense Category lists requires the consideration of more factors. the development of Biological Agent Biodefense Category lists generally takes into account characteristics of individual biological agent. ine encephalitis viruses included in risk group 1 of the china biosafety categorization. but were included in risk groups 2 and 3 according to NIH and EU categorization. Kyasanur forest Virus and Omsk Hemorrhagic fever virus included in risk group 4 according to NIH biosafety categorization. b NIH laboratory biosafety categorization: Yersinia pestis specifically pgm(\u2013) strains (lacking the 102 kb pigmentation locus) and lcr(\u2013) strains (lacking the LCR plasmid) are in group 2. c Biosecurity categorization: Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are listed clone 4 is in group 2 and non-epidemic strains are managed as risk group 3. g EU laboratory biosafety categorization: Shigella dysenteriae type 1 is in group 3. other strains are in group 2. high threat Group 1 Japanese Encephalitis Virusf 3(2) 3 2 High threat Group 2 Yellow fever virusg 3(2) 3 1(3) High threat Group 2 Rift Valley fever virush 3(2) 3 2 High threat Monkey pox 3 3 1 High threat Kyasanur Forest Virus 4 3 1 High threat west Nile Virus 3 3 2 High threat Nipah virus 1 Category C High threat SARS- associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3 3 2 Hantavirusi 3 3 influenza virus is in group 2, 1918H1N1, human H2N2 (1957\u20131968) and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strains are in group 3. f NIH laboratory biosafety categorization: lists Japanese B encephalitis. influenza virus was listed in the highest threat group according to the Russian biodefense categorization, but was included in the second highest category by the EU. the grade order of most biological agents of laboratory biosafety category list and biodefense category lists was found to be consistent. in general, the grade order of most biological agents of laboratory biosafety category list was found to be consistent. biological agents in group 1 do not generally cause human disease, while those in group 2 cause disease that is not serious and for which effective treatments and preventive measures are available. the NIH, EU and china define group 3 as agents for which effective treatments and preventive measures are available. can cause human oranimal disease but under normalcircumstances, it does not pose a serioushazard to people,animals or theenvironment. effective treatment and preventive measures are available. agent biodefense categorization is not as common as laboratory biosafety categorization. group 1 represents the highest threat, unlike the WHO, NIH and EU biosafety category lists, for which group 4 is defined as the highest threat. the development of Biological Agent Biodefense Category lists requires the consideration of more factors. Biological agent category list comparison and analysis Comparison of the biological agent category lists revealed that the laboratory biosafety risk groups of most biological agents in NIH, EU and China are consistent. Bacillus anthracis was included in NIH biosafety category risk group 2 but was included in risk group 3 according to the EU categorization. a 3(2) 3(2) 2 Category A Very high threat Group 1 Francisella tularensis b 3(2) 3(2) 2 Category A Very high threat Group 1 Burkholderia mallei 3 3 2 Category B Very high threat Group 1 Burkholderia pseudomallei 3 3 2 Category B High threat Group 1 Rickettsia prowazekii d 3 3 2 Category B High threat Group 1 Brucella species 3 3 2 Category B High threat Group 2 Staphylococcus tularensis subspecies holarctica LVS; tularensis biovar tularensis strain ATCC 6223 are in group 2. c Biosecurity categorization: Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are listed as Clostridium botulinum toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, epsilon biosafety category NIH EU China US CDC EU Russian Variola majora 4 1 Category A Very high threat Group 1 Ebola virus 4 4 1 Category A Very high threat Marburg virus 4 4 1 Category A Very high threat Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virusb 4 4 1 Very high threat Guanarito virus 4 4 1 Very high threat Junin virusc 4 4 1 Very high threat Venezuelan equine encephalitisd 3(2) 3 1 Category B High threat Influenza b NIH laboratory biosafety categorization: Congo-Crimean hamorrhagic fever virus is in group 2. e NIH laboratory biosafety categorization: influenza virus is in group 2, 1918H1N1, human H2N2 (1957\u20131968) and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strains are in group 2. Hantaan (Korean hemorrhagic fever) and Seoul virus are in risk group 3. other Hantaviruses are in risk group 2. most of the biological agents in the biodefense category list were found to be consistent. immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were categorized according to the highest laboratory biosafety level, but were not included in the corresponding biodefense level. classification of biological agents based on laboratory biosafety facilitates enhanced biological agent management and reduces the incidence of laboratory personnel infections and environmental contamination. Developing countries should also have biological agent biodefense lists. development and revision of biological agent lists requires international cooperation. bioterrorism and biowarfare threats are not unique to developed countries. the development of laboratory biosafety and biodefense capabilities requires shared experience to face the pressing questions of modern-day threat. cooperation can benefit each other, including further discussions into the making or revision of biological agent category lists. developing countries should also have biodefense biological agent lists. some developing countries are densely populous, with scant biodefense budgets. development of laboratory biosafety and biodefense capabilities requires international cooperation."}
