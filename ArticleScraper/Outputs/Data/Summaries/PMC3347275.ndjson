{"summary": "more-strand RNA viruses induce dramatic membrane rearrangements in infected cells. this leads to the formation of vesicles, which are tethered to a cellular membrane. these spherules shield the viral double-stranded RNA replication intermediates from immune surveillance. a negative-sense full-length RNA strand functions as a template for new (positive-sense) gRNA. the 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of sgRNAs are synthesized via a discontinuous transcription mechanism during subgenome-length minus strand synthesis (30); as a consequence, all sgRNAs contain a short 5\u2032-leader sequence corresponding to the 5\u2032 end of the genome. studies with other viruses show that viral genome replication occurs at the same sites where dsRNA is accumulated (reviewed in references 7 and 8). however, as no pores have been observed that connect the interior of the inner vesicles of the coronaviral DMVs with the cytoplasm, the role of the dsRNA-containing DMVs remains obscure. MHV strain A59, recombinant MHV-EFLM (6), and MHV-nsp2GFP (12) were propagated in LR7 cells. the monoclonal antibody MN, recognizing the N-terminal domain of the MHV membrane (M) protein (37), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. cells were fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) where indicated in the text, cells were transfected with the G3BP-GFP expression plasmid as previously described (12). the fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies (ICN), or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). after four washes with PBS, the samples were mounted on glass slides in FluorSave (Calbiochem) polyclonal antibodies VU145 (-pol [5)] and anti-D3 (34) are directed against MHV nsp12 and nsp2/3, respectively. the monoclonal antibody MN, recognizing the N-terminal domain of the MHV membrane (M) protein (37), was kindly provided by John Flemming. labeling cells with uridine analogs was visualized by antibody staining as described below. the samples were incubated with a 1 working solution of Click-iT reaction cocktail for 30 min at room temperature. after removal of the reaction cocktail, cells were washed once with Click-iT reaction rinse buffer. antibody staining and fluorescence confocal microscopy. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-EFLM. the luciferase expression levels were determined using the firefly luciferase assay system (Promega) at the indicated time points, the luciferase expression levels were determined using the firefly luciferase assay system. hardly any labeling of viral RNAs could be detected after 45 min of labeling. MHV- or mock-infected LR7 cells were fed with 1 mM EU for 1 h. fixation followed detection of incorporated alkyne-modified EU. cells infected with a recombinant MHV expressing the luciferase reporter gene (MHV-EFLM) were treated with different concentrations of EU (0 to 4 mM) from 5.15 until 6 h p.i. luciferase activity was determined and plotted as a percentage normalized to the control. we hypothesize that the EU-containing viral RNAs are sensitive to RNases present in one of the components used in the immunocytochemical assay. however, when we added an inhibitor of RNase-A like enzymes (RNasin), the EU signal was preserved after immunofluorescence analysis of viral proteins and/or dsRNA. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-A59 in the presence of actinomycin D. at 5.15 h p.i., the cells were fed with either 1 mM EU or BrU. antibodies against nsp2/3, previously shown to exclusively label replicative structures, were used. perinuclear nsp2-GFP fluorescence was evident in combination with newly synthesized viral RNA using copper(I)-dependent click chemistry. the newly synthesized RNA colocalized with the nsp2-GFP fluorescent foci, confirming that this fusion protein when expressed in trans localized to the structures involved in viral RNA synthesis. in infected cells, the protein concentrated in cytoplasmic foci corresponding to stress granules. the newly synthesized RNA was not localizing to these foci, indicating that EU-positive foci do not correspond to stress granules. dsRNA foci were distributed in the infected cells in one of two distinct patterns. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10, EU labeled at the indicated times p.i. for 45 min, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence detection of EU and dsRNA. dsRNA foci were not located adjacent to newly synthesized RNA, indicating that they were transcriptionally silent. nsp2/3 proteins label the coronavirus replicative structures (DMVs and CMs) antibodies to these nsp's label the coronavirus replicative structures (DMVs and CMs) similar results were obtained when antibodies against nsp8 (20) were used. dsRNA foci are mobile and move through MHV-infected cells using microtubular tracks. the dispersal of the dsRNA foci is not dependent on an intact microtubular network. however, the dispersal of the dsRNA foci was not affected by nocodazole. dispersal of dsRNA foci is not dependent on a functional microtubular or actin network. both networks appear to be required for the efficient perinuclear accumulation of the nsp2/3-positive foci. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10. early in infection nascent RNAs (EU labeling) and dsRNA dots colocalized with each other and with nsp12. at later time points, dsRNA dots were dispersed throughout the cell. nsp12 staining appeared less intense and somewhat more dispersed. however, EU-positive foci were clearly colocalizing with nsp12 at this stage. in mock-infected cells, EU was incorporated into RNA in the nuclei. in the presence of actinomycin D, only the cytoplasmic foci were labeled. this cytoplasmic staining corresponds to newly synthesized viral RNAs. thirty-five micromolar cycloheximide (CHX) was added to infected cells at 5 h p.i. to inhibit protein synthesis. cells were fed with 1 mM EU at 5 h (1 h CHX), 6 h (2 h CHX), or 7 h (3 h CHX) p.i. s of EU (0 to 4 mM) from 5.15 until 6 h p.i. the results indicate that in the presence of an inhibitor of cellular transcription, labeling of cells with EU can be used to specifically detect viral RNA synthesis. nascent viral RNA was readily detected without but not with additional immunofluorescence staining of dsRNA in MHV-infected cells. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-wild type (WT) at an MOI of 10 for 5 h, followed by either EU or BrU labeling for 45 min at 6 h p.i. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10 for 5 h, followed by either EU or BrU labeling for 45 min. Detection of BrU-labeled RNA was also critically dependent on the presence of an inhibitor of RNase-A like enzymes. newly synthesized viral RNA localizes to nsp2GFP-positive foci but is excluded from stress granules. prior to infection with MHV-WT, cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the stress granule marker G3BP-GFP, labeled for 45 min at 7 h p.i., fixed, and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence analysis. the compatibility of fluorescence detection of GFP and viral RNAs allowed us to study to what extent the viral RNAs were localizing to stress granules in infected cells LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10, EU labeled at the indicated times p.i. for 45 min, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence detection of dsRNA. at later time points p.i. concentrated patches of dsRNA were observed, while at later time points (8.15 to 9 h p.i.) mainly the dispersed pattern of dsRNA foci was detected. the Pearson's correlation coefficient is one of the standard parameters used in pattern recognition to describe the degree of overlap between the two patterns. the coefficients were significantly higher (P = 0.004) at the earlier (0,60) than at the later (0.33) time point p.i. Fig 5. Distinct dsRNA patterns at early and late times of infection. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10 and labeled with EU for 45 min starting at 5 or 8 h p.i. LR7 cells were infected with MHV-WT at an MOI of 10 and labeled with EU for 45 min starting at 5 or 8 h p.i. dispersal of the dsRNA foci is not dependent on an intact microtubular network. we treated cells with 20 M cytochalasin B or with 1 M jasplakinolide. complete disruption of the actin filaments was observed in these cells. cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs were added to the culture media from 2 h p.i. onwards. the cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs were added to the culture media from 2 h p.i. onwards. dsRNAs are thought to function as intermediates in RNA synthesis (22, 31) dsRNAs are thought to function as intermediates in RNA synthesis (22, 31) dsRNAs are thought to function as intermediates in RNA synthesis (22, 31) and have been shown to localize to membrane-wrapped compartments dedicated to this process. many dsRNA-positive foci no longer correspond with coronaviral replicative structures actively involved in RNA synthesis. dsRNA molecules function as intermediates of replication or transcription, but their presence at certain sites per se does not imply (all) these structures are actively involved in RNA synthesis. dsRNAs were found colocalizing at or adjacent to patches of dsRNA dots. many dsRNA dots were apparently not transcriptionally active, as no EU labeling was associated with them. dsRNA-containing DMVs may represent nonfunctional end-stage structures. dsRNA, nsp's, and nascent RNA colocalized with nsp12. nascent RNA and viral RNA colocalized with nsp12. nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with nsp12."}
