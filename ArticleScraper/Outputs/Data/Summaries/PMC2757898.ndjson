{"summary": "infectious agents can be new in the sense of not having previously infected humans or new in the sense that a combination of preexisting genetic factors have reassembled to give rise to an infectious agent with a substantially altered genome. in both cases, a change in the selective pressure on an infectious agent allows its emergence from a specific setting. the potential infectious disease agent could arise from an environment that only contains pieces of a \u201cvirulence puzzle\u201d. funding agencies in the u.s. and other countries have prioritized research projects on organisms that might challenge our security and economy. this has resulted in large amounts of funding dedicated to so-called \"biodefense\" research, totaling close to 50 billion between 2001 and 2009. genomics can be readily applied to follow outbreaks of infectious diseases. this is clearly illustrated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002\u20132003. in both cases, genomics played a key role in the immediate response to the outbreak. genomics can be readily applied to follow outbreaks of infectious diseases. this is clearly illustrated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002\u20132003 and the emergence and spread of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus this year. open-source genomic resources are an essential component of the nation preparedness to biological threats (biopreparedness) some consider open-source genomic resources a threat to security because they make publicly available information that could facilitate the construction of dangerous infectious agents. we strongly disagree with this point of view; others believe it is an enabling tool more useful to those in charge of our public health and biosecurity than those with ill intentions. open access to the genomic DNA that has been sequenced or the culture from which the DNA was extracted is key to successful genome sequencing projects. well-documented genome sequence data will form a key growing resource for biodefense and other research fields. new bioinformatics software tools are being developed that exploit Web-based services. decentralized rapid genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of infectious agents will enable near-real-time global surveillance, detection of new pathogens, new virulence factors, or engineered organisms. population genomics addresses the genomic diversity within these assemblages and has significant implications for pathogen evolution, diagnostics, epidemiology, and microbial forensics. the only genotypic differences were found in a small, phenotypically and genetically distinct portion of cells grown from the spores used in the attacks. a genetic assay was developed to screen a B. anthracis spore repository, which identified the origin of the spores as a single spore stock of B. anthracis Ames. population-level genome sequencing projects provide us with information about the pangenomic gene pool and the potential of a species to evolve into a novel pathogen. the concept of population genomics applies to epidemiological studies of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as those caused by food-borne or zoonotic pathogens. genome sequencing of several isolates from the same outbreak performed in our laboratory, however, revealed genomic variations that questioned a direct evolutionary link between all outbreak-associated isolates. phylogenetic analyses suggest several highly related genotypes were at the source of the outbreak, thus challenging the utility of assigning a single reference strain to a specific outbreak. sequencing projects provide us with information about the pangenomic gene pool. what distinguishes a commensal from a pathogenic isolate? what role does horizontal gene transfer play in species evolution? a better understanding of the ecological principles that shape the composition of our microbiome might contribute to our biopreparedness for such a threat to public health. the field of biodefense has thoroughly embraced genomics and made it a keystone for developing better identification technologies, diagnostic tools, and vaccines. the need for better bioinformatic algorithms, access to faster computing capabilities, larger or novel and more efficient data storage devices are all in critical demand. informatics and computing resources are becoming the bottleneck to making progress in this field."}
