{"summary": "METH inhibits endothelial cell viability and disrupts cell\u2013cell barrier integrity. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 1 M METH for 24, 48 or 72 h. panel ii shows granular/vesicular structures indicative of autophagosome formation. HUVECs were treated with METH (1 M) for 3, 6 and 24 h in the presence of pepstatin A and E-64d. cell lysates were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. LC3 (ATG 8) is first cleaved by ATG4 to generate LC3-I. LC3-II is incorporated into the inner and outer surfaces of autophagosomes. if autophagy flux is occurring, the levels of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitors. sosomes.14 HUVECs were transfected with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1-green fluorescent protein (LAMP1-GFP) and then treated with vehicle or METH. increased LAMP1-GFP-labeled vesicles in METH-treated HUVECs after 24 and 48 h. western blot analysis for Beclin1, Bcl-2 and -tubulin in METH-treated HUVECs. values were normalized against -tubulin and presented as a ratio. data represent means of three independent blots. the western blots in Figures 2d and e showed that in control cells Bcl-2 co-immunoprecipitated with Beclin1 which decreased following 24 h of METH treatment. a growing body of evidence indicate that KOR may be involved in the modulation of abuse-related effects of CNS stimulants. mETH-induced Beclin1 expression is mediated through the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). HUVECs were treated with 1 M, 10 M and 20 M nor-BNI 1 h before METH treatment for 24 h. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on HUVECs treated with METH for 24 h. exposure to 1 M METH for 24 h revealed double-membrane vacuolar structures. treatment did not cause significant appearance of double-membrane vacuolar structures. phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway. ii) the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK cells exposed to METH for 6, 24 and 48 h showed a decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR. treatment with METH showed a downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR. 3-MA and chloroquine have different structures, different mechanisms of action and act at early and late stages of autophagy progression. 3-MA is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that prevents autophagy at the earliest stage of autophagosome formation. cells were either pretreated with or without autophagy inhibitor 3-MA before the addition of METH for 72 h. treatment with METH for 24 h showed a significant increase in Caspase-8 and Caspase-3/7 activation in HUVECs. compared with only METH treatment, METH-induced Caspase-3/7 activation significantly elevated when pretreated with 20 M PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) three independent experiments were performed. the activity of caspase-3 was also measured in HUVECs transfected with Beclin1 knockdown. the results showed that METH significantly increased caspase-3 activity in the HUVECs with Beclin1 knockdown compared with METH treatment alone. HUVECs treated with 1 M METH in the presence or absence of 50 M zVAD-fmk. treatment of HUVECs with METH (1 M) and Rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h shows a significant increase in the LC3 punctate staining pattern (green) when compared with untreated cells. microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and HUVECs were cultured on ECIS array electrodes. no significant decrease in average transendothelial electrical resistance measurements was observed with 1 M METH at 24 h but at 72 h, a 50% decrease in resistance was observed compared with control. inhibitors can be used to examine the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway. if autophagy flux is occurring, the levels of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitors. we also examined LAMP1 which is an integral glycoprotein residing in late endosomes and lysosomes. Bcl-2 family proteins negatively regulate the kinase activity of the Beclin1\u2013Vps34 complex. accumulation of Beclin1 protein can be used as an indicator of autophagy induction. to further confirm METH-induced autophagy, we measured Beclin1 protein level. the expression of Beclin1 was induced at 24 and 48 h of exposure. the expression of Beclin1 was induced at 24 and 48 h of exposure. the expression of Beclin1 was induced at 24 and 48 h of exposure. nor-BNI in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression at the indicated concentrations of 1, 10 and 20 M nor-BNI. a total of 20 M nor-BNI significantly inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression compared with METH treatment alone. cells were then analyzed using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope. images were obtained at 10 000 (i) and 40 000 (ii) magnification using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope. METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased upon knockdown of KOR. METH activates the ERK1/2 pathway and inhibits the Akt/mTOR pathway Autophagy is a multi-step process. cells exposed to METH for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h showed an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation after 6 h of treatment. values were normalized against -tubulin and presented as a ratio compared with the basal level (0 h of treatment). 0.1 M, 1 M, 10 M and 20 M PD98059 inhibited mETH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression compared with METH treatment alone. treatment with METH showed a downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR, 6 h post treatment. cells were either pretreated with or without 3-MA before the addition of 1 M METH for 72 h. 3-MA alone caused minimal apoptosis at 72 h, as measured by Annexin V labeling. Caspase activity was measured with Caspase-Glo assay systems (Promega) results were expressed as percentage of the treated cells to the untreated control cells. treatment with METH for 24 h showed a significant increase in Caspase-8 and Caspase-3/7 activation in HUVECs as compared with the control. caspase activity was measured in METH-treated HUVECs using Caspase-Glo 8, Caspase-Glo 3/7 and Caspase-Glo 9 assay systems in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor PD98059. however, the induction was dramatically increased when cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. METH-induced autophagy in endothelial cells was triggered by inactivation of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. changes in Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex have been observed in endothelial cell autophagy when treated with anti-angiogenic inhibitors. more recent studies suggest that METH-induced neurotoxicity may also result from its ability to induce impairment of BBB function. the BBB has a predominant role in actively transporting nutrients to the brain and filtering harmful compounds from the brain back to the bloodstream. no studies have investigated the effects of METH at doses seen in METH addicts in BBB endothelial cells. LC3 and Beclin1 are two key proteins for autophagy function. signaling from the cytoplasm to the autophagy machinery is controlled in a negative manner through serine/threonine kinase, a mTOR. inhibition of the pathway by a MAPK kinase (PD98059) suppresses starvation-induced autophagy in the human colon cancer cell line. autophagy is an early response to the METH-induced stress. chronic exposure to the drug allows for progression through autophagic flux and commits cells to apoptosis. findings clarify link between autophagy and apoptosis signaling induced by METH abuse. mTOR, p-mTOR, p-mTOR, p-ERK1/2 and LC3 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) cell culture Human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) were grown in tissue-culture flasks pre-coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) HBMECs and HUVECs were treated with METH 1 M in the absence or presence of zVAD-fmk. changes in the resistance were continuously monitored for up to 72 h. cell pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 40 min. samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 30 min. the luminescence was read in a microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Cary, NC, USA) caspase activity was normalized to vehicle treatment. the reduction in Beclin1 and KOR mRNA expression were estimated by real-time PCR analysis. cells were stained using an Annexin V (green) -FLUOS assay kit. images were recorded with a Nikon confocal microscope at 400 magnification. cell culture Human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) were grown in tissue-culture flasks pre-coated with 0.2% gelatin. primary HBMECs were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.
