{"summary": "four global commissions reviewing recent Ebola virus disease response consistently recommended strengthening national health systems. system-wide accountability is vital to effectively prevent, detect, and respond to future global health emergencies. the IHR requires 196 States Parties to develop and maintain core health system capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern. each country\u2019s assessment will be made public, with a color-coding scheme to delineate implementation levels for each capacity [11]. Until governments achieve a high degree of compliance with IHR obligations, however, WHO should plan more frequent external assessments, rather than waiting 5 years between assessments. participants in the community should also be a critical component of assessments. a major weakness of the new mechanism for monitoring the core capacities of states is that it is voluntary. a major weakness of the new mechanism for monitoring the core capacities of states is that it is voluntary, reflecting state sovereignty concerns. the world bank, bilateral donors, and multilateral donors should make funding of health systems contingent on the participation of the recipient in the external assessment process. the IMF should include pandemic preparedness in its assessments of individual countries. governments should increase spending on training health professionals, especially community health workers who are most familiar with the local culture. no recommendation. Efforts to improve outbreak preparedness and response must include women at all levels of planning and operations and must take women\u2019s needs into account. the world is ill-prepared for a severe pandemic or for any similarly global, sustained and threatening public health emergency. the commissions\u2019 reports focused on reforms for WHO and the UN system. the world bank should establish a Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. CGHRF Harvard/LSHTM UN Panel WHO Interim Assessment Independent Centre for Preparedness & Response (CHEPR) WHO should create a unified Centre for emergency preparedness & response with clear responsibility, adequate capacity, and strong lines of accountability. the commissions unanimously recommended that WHO create a centre for emergency preparedness and response (CEPR) the Centre would have a clear mandate, separate funding streams, and strong lines of accountability. Member States have resisted providing the funding needed for WHO to fulfill its global mandate, and most existing funding is earmarked. no recommendation. WHO must develop organizational culture for emergency preparedness and response. re-negotiate the pandemic influenza Preparedness Framework to include other novel pathogens. the IHR Review Committee should consider financial incentives for early reporting, including insurance to mitigate adverse economic effects. the Committee also should consider financial disincentives to discourage countries from restricting trade and travel beyond measures recommended by WHO. c. 3) Strategic Collaboration between WHO and health partners at the national level. analysis should look beyond traditional government ministry partners to include private sector actors and civil society organizations. the DG should establish an external, independent oversight body to monitor the performance of the Programme for Outbreaks and Emergencies. members of the oversight body should be multi-sectoral and may be drawn from member states, donors, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, and the UN system. the SG should integrate the UN\u2019s health and humanitarian crisis trigger systems. the SG should integrate the UN\u2019s emergency grades and criteria for declaring a PHEIC with the emergency levels applied in the broader humanitarian system. ebola and Zika epidemics revealed systemic deficiencies in R&D. the paucity of medical technologies stem primarily from low commercial priority, limited funding, and practical challenges of conducting human trials for episodic infections. PPDC should convene national regulators, industry stakeholders, and research organizations to accelerate R&D by promoting regulatory convergence. governments, researchers, private industry, and non-governmental organizations must develop a framework of norms and rules operating during and between outbreaks to enable and accelerate research. the UN SG and WHO DG should convene a summit of public, private, and non-profit research funders to establish a global financing facility for the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and rapid diagnostics for communicable diseases neglected by the commercial market. no recommendation. research requires sharing biological materials, but governments sometimes delay. denotes individual/body with responsibility for declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) changes to the accountability frameworks during a PHEIC that has turned into a humanitarian crisis. the commissions unanimously recommended that the Director-General name governments that fail to act as responsible global citizens [22]. it may be possible to coax states\u2019 compliance with their IHR obligations through skilled diplomacy and incentives."}
