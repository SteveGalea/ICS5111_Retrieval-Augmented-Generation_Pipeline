{"summary": "four distinct but closely related serotypes of DENV are the cause of a wide range of clinical presentations including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases in tropical and subtropical countries with an estimated 390 million annual cases. a recent study reanalyzed data from three efficacy trials of the CYD-TDV vaccine. it found that despite the vaccine conferred protection against severe dengue and hospitalization for dengue seropositive subjects for up to 5 years. the same vaccine put dengue nave individuals at a higher risk of infection and disease. a single vaccine with representative epitopes or consensus sequences from multiple strains may be a novel vaccine strategy. the development in bioinformatics and computational approaches have brought versatility in vaccine design. a single vaccine with representative epitopes or consensus sequences from multiple strains may be a novel vaccine strategy needing exploration. recombinant product composed of critical neutralizing epitopes of each serotype of DENV. the rivet of epitopes from highly conserved regions of virus by using consensus sequence is a reasonable option for targeting different serotypes of DENV. we have previously designed a vaccine based on the most conserved regions of E protein ectodomain, named it consensus-based E80. C6/36 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, United States) supplemented with 10% FBS at 28\u00b0C. all cells were cultivated under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. the DENV1 (Hawaii strain), the DENV2 (TR1751 strain), the DENV3 (H87 strain) and the DENV4 (H241 strain) were propagated in C6/36 cells. cE80 protein was added upstream to the cE80 DNA sequence (Supplementary Text S1). the synthetic cE80 sequence was subcloned in between EcoRI and NotI sites of pVAX1 vector (hereinafter, pV), and named as pV-cE80. mice were immunized three times at 3-week intervals. the levels of IgG subclass responses were expressed as 450 nm OD. data were expressed as means + SD (n = 8) antibodies were detected with goat-anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:4,000, HRP coupled, Abcam, United States) and substrate solution of tetramethylbenzidine. the reciprocal of the highest dilution was recorded as the end-point titer of IgG antibody. the levels of IgG subclasses were expressed as OD value. splenocytes were blocked with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibody. cells were then incubated with hamster anti-mouse CD3e-FITC, rat anti-mouse CD8-APC-H7, rat anti-mouse CD44-APC, and rat anti-mouse CD62L-PE. samples were analyzed using ELISPOT kits (BD, United States) mice were challenged with either 1 105 PFU of DENV1 (Hawaii strain), or 200 PFU of DENV2 (Tr1751 strain), or 1 107 PFU of DENV3 (H87 strain), or 1 105 PFU of DENV4 (H241 strain), individually. the body weight change in individual mouse and survival rate were monitored daily for 12 days. cE80 sequence has 87.41\u201394.50% nucleotide homology and 73.33\u201388.25% amino acid homology with E80 sequences of the four representative DENV serotypes. synthetic cE80 sequence was subcloned in between EcoRI and NotI sites. immunoization schedule Mice were divided into groups receiving either homologous or heterologous prime-boost vaccinations. mice were immunized with 50 g pV-cE80 in 50 l of normal saline. mice were either inoculated i.m. once with 50 g pV-cE80 by in vivo EP method and followed by boosted subcutaneously (s.c.) twice with 10 g cE80 protein emulsified with 10 l of Alhydrogel\u00ae adjuvant (DPP) the two corresponding control groups were given i.m. once/twice with 50 g pV by in vivo EP method. gG subclasses, sera from immunized mice (at 1:100 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. deNV1 (Hawaii strain), DENV2 (TR1751 strain), DENV3 (H87 strain) and DENV4 (H241 strain) were used in this test. e-FITC, rat anti-mouse CD8-APC-H7, rat anti-mouse CD44-APC, and rat anti-mouse CD62L-PE samples were analyzed on a DxFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, united States) assays Splenocyte-produced IL-4 and IFN- were determined using ELISPOT kits (BD, United States) the sequence alignments and homology were analyzed with DNASTAR software. differences of mean body weight changes between groups were analyzed. the difference between means is considered significant if P 0.05, very significant if P 0.01, and extremely significant if P 0.001. a GMT of anti-DENV2 nAb reached 1:139 (95% CI, 1:107\u20131:184) following the DDD regimen. no control pV-administrated mice showed detectable nAb activity. mice immunized via heterologous prime-boost regimens induced significantly higher IgG titers. the heterologous regimens, DPP and DDP, evoked anti-DENV2 antibodies of all these subclasses, including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. these data indicated that heterologous vaccination could induce better IgG diversification than homologous regimens, imply a better T cell activation. data were expressed as mean + SD (n = 8), P 0.05, P 0.01, P 0.001. mice vaccinated with all three immunization regimens had significantly triggered DENV2-specific IL-4 and IFN- responses as compared to controls. mice in all control groups showed 28\u201334% body weight loss (Figure 4A\u2013C) and none of them survived the viral challenge (Figure 4D,E). the DPP group showed even less daily body weight loss (14%) than controls (P 0.01, Figure 4B) and also a survival rate of 75% (P 0.01, Figure 4E). three weeks after the last vaccination using the cE80 vaccines with the DDP regimen, considerable IgG responses were generated to DENV1 and DENV2. titers of 1:6,400 (95% CI, 1:6,400\u20131:6,400) and 1:4,850 (95% CI, 1:1,847\u20131:9,240), respectively. mice vaccinated with the DDP regimen were challenged i.c. with DENV1, DENV3 or DENV4 separately. after DENV1, the mean body weight loss was only 8\u201311%. after DENV4 challenge, vaccinated mice had a body weight loss of 16%. a higher survival rate and a prolonged survival time were observed in vaccinated mice (62.5%) than controls. control 230 (110\u2013393) 10 (10\u201310) aP values were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. compared titers in vaccine subgroups with those of control subgroups, n = 5, *P 0.5, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001 GMTs, geometric mean titers. cE80 DNA and cE80 protein vaccines can elicit the most effective immune responses with cE80 DNA and cE80 protein vaccines. we then compared three immunization strategies, including thrice DNA (DDD), DNA prime twice plus protein boost once (DDP) and DNA prime once plus protein boost twice (DPP) the GMTs were 1:16,127 (95% CI, 1:11,874\u20131:22,210) and 1:25,600 (95% CI, 1:16,906\u20131:39,794) in the DPP and DDP regimens respectively, which were 13- and 21-folds higher than that of the homologous DDD immunization group. a similar result of higher nAb titers was also observed. mice immunized with the DDP regimen developed strongest anti-DENV2 humoral immune responses. the homologous DDD regimen induced the weakest, and the DPP performed in between. CD8+ T cell responses were analyzed 1 week after the third vaccination. mice vaccinated with all three immunization regimens had significantly triggered DENV2-specific IL-4 and IFN- responses. the DPP regimen induced more IL-4 than the DDD regimen (Figure 3A,B), and the DDP regimen elicited the highest levels of both IFN- and IL-4 responses (Figure 3A,B), both were significantly higher than that in the DDD regimen (P 0.05). the DD group showed even less daily body weight loss (14%) than controls (P 0.01, Figure 4A); and 75% survived after viral challenge (P 0.05, DDD vs. control, Figure 4D) the heterologous DDP prime-boost regimen protected 100% of all mice (P 0.001, Figure 4F), which showed no obvious body weight loss (P 0.001, Figure 4C) tetravalent neutralizing antibodies were generated by the cE80 vaccines against all four DENV serotypes. titers of 1:6,400 (95% CI, 1:6,400\u20131:6,400) and 1:4,850 (95% CI, 1:1,847\u20131:9,240), respectively. mice vaccinated with the cE80 vaccines were challenged i.c. with DENV1, DENV3, or DENV4 separately. cE80 immunization with the DDP regimen could induce protective immunity to four serotypes of DENV. vaccinated mice had a body weight loss of 16%. a higher survival rate and a prolonged survival time were observed in vaccinated mice. cytokine-secreting splenocytes were determined after stimulation with purified DENV1\u20134 particles, individually. the positive splenocytes were counted and expressed as the mean SFU/3 105 cells. data were expressed as mean + SD (n = 8) homologous immunization with three doses of cE80 protein was sufficient to induce binding and tetravalent nAb and Th2 type immune response. a tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine tested in a phase I clinical trial has demonstrated its safety, tolerability, and capacity of eliciting DENV-specific IFN- responses. unization with three doses of pV-cE80 DNA (DDD) was less effective than heterologous prime-boost regimens (DPP and DDP) using pV-cE80 and cE80 protein in combination. the specific reason for this observation is unclear, but some possibilities could be considered. homologous vaccination with the shuffled constructs only provided limited protection against either DENV1 or DENV2 in vaccinated animals. heterologous vaccination regimens induced high level of memory T cells, but also elevated antibody response and conferred protection against all four serotypes of DENV. heterologous vaccination regimens produce a better immune response than homologous vaccination. DNA is often used as a prime antigen for pre-sensitizing antigen-specific memory B cells. the protein-boost stimulates memory B cells to divide and differentiate into plasma cells that secret antibody with greater magnitude. the activation of both humoral and cellular immune responses by a DNA, followed by boosting with a protein vaccine in the heterologous vaccination regimen will likely be more effective at inducing protective immunity. the heterologous DDP immunization regimen would be advantageous in significantly improving the DENV2-specific CD8+ responses and simultaneous Th1 and Th2 responses. if the same principle applies to other vaccine antigens, the same principle applies to other vaccine antigens. the cE80 sequence shares the highest homology in amino acid DENV2. cE80 contains many predicted epitopes within DENV2. this could have contributed to a more robust humoral immune response. we first compared three vaccination regimens with a DNA and a protein vaccine containing the same cE80 sequence in either DDD, or DDP, or DPP format. we demonstrated that DDP is the optimal method for inducing robust neutralizing antibodies, strong antigen-specific T cell responses and effective protection against DENV2. a tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine tested in a phase I clinical trial has demonstrated its safety, tolerability, and capacity of eliciting DENV-specific IFN- responses. we found that homologous immunization with three doses of pV-cE80 DNA (DDD) was less effective than heterologous prime-boost regimens (DPP and DDP) using pV-cE80 protein in combination. de Filette et al. (2014) reported that the DNA prime-protein boost immunization strategy could result in a marked increase in nAb titer and a complete protection against a lethal west Nile virus. intracellular antigens expressed by DNA vaccine tend to fold in native conformation and correctly glycosylated form. protein vaccines are delivered exogenously to host cells and mostly elicit antibody response in connection with the MHC-II pathway of antigen presentation. s cell from injection sites to draining lymph nodes could be stimulated. these intricate interactions during vaccination process might explain why the DDP regimen led to the induction of higher level of antibody and cytokine responses. the heterologous DDP immunization regimen would be advantageous in significantly improving the DENV2-specific CD8+ responses and simultaneous Th1 and Th2 responses. the cE80 vaccines used in a DDP immunization regimen could induce tetravalent protection against infection by all four DENV serotypes. this may be related to the fact that the cE80 sequence shares the highest homology in amino acid DENV2. cE80 contains many predicted epitopes within DENV2. the success of Zika DNA vaccines will likely inform the rational development of dengue DNA vaccine. we found that adding a DNA vaccine (D) encoding the same antigen will augment the efficacy of the cE80 vaccine.
