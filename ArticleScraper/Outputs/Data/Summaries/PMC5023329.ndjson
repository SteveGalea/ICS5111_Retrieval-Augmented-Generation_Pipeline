{"summary": "the livestock-wildlife interface, historically underappreciated as a cause of disease emergence, is now recognized as an intersection from which pathogens can be transmitted from agricultural to free-ranging hosts. avian influenza is a biosecurity threat to the poultry industry due to its spillover from waterfowl reservoirs and subsequent viral spill back from domestic chickens. live vaccine viruses present additional risks such as reversion of virulence and recombination with wild-type strains. the use of live vaccines continues to dominate the poultry industry. in the united states, the continuous demand for more effective vaccines is likely driven by the industry\u2019s prior experience with large-scale poultry epidemics. we examined the hypothesis that live NDV vaccines may spill into wild birds. we identified existing cases of vaccine-derived NDV reported previously in wild birds. we also sequenced NDV wild bird isolates from Ukraine, Bulgaria and Brazil. pigeons were captured using hand-nets, drop-nets, mist-nets, and ground traps. each bird was placed into one of two age classes: hatch-year birds (HY) born during the current breeding cycle or after hatch-year birds (AHY) born prior to 2012. vacutainers were tilted overnight at room temperature, then centrifuged at 1500 rpm, and the harvested sera were subsequently stored at -20\u00b0C. oral and cloacal swabs were collected from each bird, then transferred into separate 2.0 mL cryovials containing 1.5 mL of Brain-Heart Infusion (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) virulence of rock Pigeon isolates was determined from allantoic fluid by ICPI test in 1-day-old SPF chickens. only samples demonstrating complete HI at the serum dilution 1:16 (24) or higher were considered positive for presence of NDV antibodies. RNA extractions of USA pigeon isolates and viruses from Bulgaria and Ukraine were performed using TRIzol LS (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) a total of 54 isolates from the following taxonomic orders are tabulated below. anseriformes (n = 1); anseriformes (n = 13); Charadriiformes (n = 3); Columbiformes (n = 23); Falconiformes (n = 1); Galliformes (n = 2); Pelecaniformes (n = 2); Psittaciformes (n = 1 KU159667 II B1 Columbiformes (Rock Pigeon) USA/Georgia GA/1 2012 This Study KU159668 II B1 Columbiformes (Rock Pigeon) USA/Georgia GA/3 2012 This Study KU159671 II B1 Columbiformes (Rock Pigeon) USA/Georgia GA/6 2012 This Study JX901331.1 II B1 Columbiformes (Pige ta Columbiformes (Rock Pigeon) Bulgaria/Sofia Govedartzi 2002 This Study KU133351 II LaSota Unknown Bulgaria/Varna Varna 2006 This Study KU133352 II LaSota Anseriformes (Mute Swan) Bulgaria/Burgas Ravna Gora 2006 This Study KU133353 II LaSota Anseriformes (Mute Swan) Bulgaria/Burgas Mal china/Shangdong H1 (SD1 in paper) 2011 [115] JX482549.1 II LaSota Charadriiformes (Shorebird/Wader) China/Jiangsu H5 (JS1 in paper) 2011 [115] KM670001.1 II LaSota Anseriformes (Duck) China/Shangdong SD09 2014 [48] bAY359876.1 II LaSota Passer laSota Columbiformes (Pigeon) Ukraine/Dnipropetrovsk 7/Dnipropetrovsk 2007 This Study KU133365 II LaSota Columbiformes (Pigeon) Ukraine/Kharkiv Kharkiv/1 2007 This Study JX901345.1 II LaSota Columbiformes (Pigeon) USA/Maryland 0715 2007 [111] JX193079.1 Ia V czoo birds were characterized at the university of so Paulo (brazil). RNA purifications were performed with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) viruses isolated from domestic non-poultry species such as waterfowl from live bird markets were excluded from the dataset. an additional 15 representative sequences from the remaining genotypes (III-XIV and XVI-XVIII) were also included, resulting in a final dataset of 74 sequences. a nucleotide distance of approximately 1% per decade is the natural rate of NDV evolution [73, 74]. compared to the most closely related vaccine strains, NDV isolates with nucleotide distances lower than 0.1% per decade were termed vaccine-derived viruses. shedding Rock Pigeons had a measurably smaller weight-to-wing chord ratio than non-shedding Rock Pigeons. we used a one-way generalized linear model (GLM) to examine whether shedding Rock Pigeons had a measurably smaller weight-to-wing chord ratio. pigeons were captured using hand-nets, drop-nets, mist-nets, and ground traps. each bird was placed into one of two age classes: hatch-year birds (HY) born during the current breeding cycle or after hatch-year birds (AHY) born prior to 2012. vacutainers were tilted overnight at room temperature, centrifuged at 1500 rpm, and the harvested sera were stored at -20\u00b0C. oral and cloacal swabs were collected from each bird, then transferred into separate 2.0 mL cryovials (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) containing 1.5 mL of Brain-Heart Infusion. virulence of rock Pigeon isolates was determined from allantoic fluid by ICPI test in 1-day-old SPF chickens [61] only samples demonstrating complete HI at the serum dilution 1:16 (24) or higher were considered positive for presence of NDV antibodies [63] RNA extractions of USA pigeon isolates and viruses from Bulgaria and Ukraine were performed using TRIzol LS.

Statistical analyses were performed with SAS v. 9.3 [75] for small sample sizes and dichotomous variables. shedding Rock Pigeons had a measurably smaller weight-to-wing chord ratio than non-shedding Rock Pigeons. we used a one-way generalized linear model (GLM) to examine whether shedding Rock Pigeons had a measurably smaller weight-to-wing chord ratio than their non-shedding counterparts. ICPI experimental infection swabs collected from the oral and cloacal cavities positive for virus are listed below with their corresponding ICPI values. the 24 isolates from wild birds in Brazil, Bulgaria, Ukraine and the USA contained fusion protein cleavage sites specific for NDV of low virulence with two basic amino acids. viral sequences that were evolutionarily closely related to reference vaccine strains from genotypes I and II were selected for further analysis. nine of them clustered together with the vaccine strain chicken/USA/LaSota/1946, while the other 15 isolates grouped with two additional ND vaccine strains of genotype II. isolates from wild birds are genetically closely related to vaccine strains of NDV genotype I and II. the mean genetic distance between the viruses and the vaccine strains within each of these genotype I branches was considerably low. the oldest isolation detected occurred in 1997 and the most recent in 2014 with samples from free-ranging (n = 47) and captive (n = 7) birds. the results demonstrate that vaccine-derived NDV were detected in eight countries on four different continents. shedding HY birds would have a lower mean ranked fat score than non-shedding HY birds. we found no statistical difference in visible subcutaneous fat between shedding (n = 9) and non-shedding (n = 36) HY individuals (Kruskal-Wallis, H = 0.1117, p = 0.7382). ICPI experimental infection swabs from the oral and cloacal cavities positive for virus are listed below with their corresponding ICPI values. the 24 isolates from wild birds in Brazil, Bulgaria, Ukraine and the USA contained fusion protein cleavage sites specific for NDV of low virulence. 54 viral sequences that were evolutionarily closely related to reference vaccine strains from genotypes I and II were selected for further analysis. using established criteria, the 24 NDV sequences were classified as members of genotype II of class II [81] using established criteria, the 24 sequences were classified as members of genotype II of class II. rals represent the genotype for each isolate, followed by the GenBank identification number, host name, strain designation and country of isolation. isolates from wild birds originating from Argentina, Bulgaria, China, India, Mexico and Ukraine clustered in a monophyletic branch with vaccine strain chicken/USA/LaSota/1946. the most frequent isolations occurred in the orders Columbiformes (n = 23) and Anseriformes (n = 13) the oldest isolation detected occurred in 1997 and the most recent in 2014 with samples from free-ranging (n = 47) and captive (n = 7) birds. shedding HY birds would have a lower mean ranked fat score than non-shedding HY birds. we found no statistical difference in visible subcutaneous fat between shedding (n = 9) and non-shedding (n = 36) HY individuals. four different types of vaccine-derived viruses have been identified in at least 17 wild bird species. the identification rates of laSota- and B1-like viruses were substantially higher compared to the rest of the vaccines. the presence of vaccine-derived NDV in non-target species is likely to be underestimated. the high number of cases and the biological and behavioral characteristics of the order Columbiformes suggest that these birds have a high degree of association with vaccine-derived viruses. this may be associated with the higher vulnerability to disease of juveniles due to their increased movement requirements for foraging, in concert with nave immune systems. species reported to shed vaccine-derived NDV are listed by the international Union for Conservation of Nature as taxa of conservation concern. some of the vaccine-derived viruses were obtained from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline. ecological implications of this finding are currently unknown. the analysis of 54 isolates is a small sample size from which to draw inferences about the potential impact of spillovers of NDV vaccines. the referenced studies did not indicate that vaccine viruses were specifically targeted for sampling as opposed to wild-type NDV. pairwise nucleotide distance analysis of vaccine-derived viruses to V-4 vaccine.
