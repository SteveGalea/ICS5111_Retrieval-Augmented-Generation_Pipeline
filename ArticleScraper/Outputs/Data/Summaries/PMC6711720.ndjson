January to March had the lowest number of travelers tested positive for WFB communicable diseases out of 1,542. the detection of causative agents of WFB communicable diseases was at its highest rate from July to September. January to March had the lowest number of travelers tested positive for WFB communicable diseases out of 1,542. travelers entered Korea from Southeast Asia, East Asia and Central Asia (n = 5,297) reported diarrhea. there was a statistically significant difference in the positive detection of causative agents of WFB communicable diseases. travelers entered Korea with diarrhea, fever and respiratory symptoms. incidences of reported diarrhea increased by 2.5 times in 2017 compared to 2016. 164 cases of shigellosis and typhoid fever among the communicable diseases. in designated communicable diseases (10,877 cases), 9,547 (87.8%) cases were detected in ETEC and EPEC. a study by Jeon et al showed the same results as reported in the case of ETEC, Shigella spp., and Vibrio cholerae as causative agents of gastrointestinal communicable diseases from overseas. travelers entered Korea in 2017 who came from Southeast Asia, 70.2% (n = 2,770) of 3,947 travelers with diarrhea were found to be infected with a WFB communicable disease. laboratory tests of travelers with diarrhea (n = 1,350) who visited East Asia and Central Asia were positive for the disease. the number of causative agents from WFB communicable diseases in 2017 was the highest between July and September, when many people entered Korea from Southeast Asia."}
