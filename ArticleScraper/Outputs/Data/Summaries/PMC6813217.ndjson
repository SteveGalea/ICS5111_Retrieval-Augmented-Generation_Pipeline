{"summary": "a huge success was the development of potent, safe and affordable viral human and veterinary vaccines using egg- and cell-based production systems. novel approaches toward vaccination are under development, i.e., DNA and RNA vaccines. many viruses change rapidly in face of selective pressure and emergence of antiviral drug resistance is of major concern. DIPs were already identified in the early fifties by studies of von Magnus. they are characterized by deletions in the viral genome preventing the synthesis of a protein essential for viral spread. the presence of DIPs has been demonstrated for almost every virus studied. production of the DI244 antiviral candidate can be realized in eggs followed by an ultraviolet (UV) irradiation process to destroy STV infectivity. more recently, an in vitro and in vivo antiviral effect was demonstrated for a combination of defective interfering genes of IAV for avian and seasonal influenza using a dual-functional peptide vector. mathematical models for DIP and STV replication can be established to describe their basic dynamics in cell culture. we investigated continuous influenza virus production in a cascade of two stirred tank bioreactors. RTs allow for at least two oscillations in STV and DIP replication dynamics. cell concentrations, infectious and non-infectious virus titers, and extracellular copy numbers of S1 for both STV, i.e., full-length (FL) S1 and a known form of DIP, delS1(1) were determined. S1 RNA was isolated from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34. cDNA was cloned into the pHW2000 vector. plasmid carrying defective S1 sequence pHW-A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) was obtained. a virus seed containing A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and STV was obtained. the resulting virus bank had an HA titer of 2.36 log10(HA Units/100 L), a TCID50 titer of 6.76107 virions/mL, a FL S1 content of 9.7109 copies/mL, and a DI S1 (A/PR/8/34-delS1(1)) content of 2.9108 copies initial plasmid contamination was 17.6% for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1). from zero h p.i. on the plasmid contamination was not detectable any longer, since the virus preparation was diluted due to the low MOI applied for infection (MOI 0.1) all experiments were performed in laboratories with a biological safety level 2 (BSL 2) certification following the respective safety regulations. virus seed (A/PR/8/34-delS1(1)) was added to the VB1 and VB2 at an MOI of 0.1 based on the viable cell count and the TCID50 titer of the virus seed at 50 h of culture. the virus inoculum was supplemented with 1:100 ratio of trypsin (volume to culture volume) cell-adapted virus seed containing A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and FL standard virus (STV) was added to VB1 and VB2 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. cells were constantly fed into both virus bioreactors (F, feeding rate) trypsin was added to the fresh medium reservoir of VB1 and VB2. qPCR was performed using the Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Kit. the primer pairs realtime-rev (GGAATCCCCTCAGTCTTC) and vRNA-tagRealtime-for for quantification of FL S1. the plasmid pHW-S1 was quantified with the primer pair FL1-realtime-rev and pHW-f (CTCACTATAGGGAGACCC) the plasmid pHW-A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) was quantified with the primer pair realtime-rev and pHW-f. the plasmid pHW-A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) was quantified with the primer pair realtime-rev and a differentiation between infectious FL S1-containing virions (VS) and non-infectious FL S1-containing virions (Vd) is made. Equation (4) accounts for the continuous virus production system. we choose Tin to be independent of time (data not shown) with respect to the average concentration of cells observed in CB, we choose Tin to be independent of time.

STVs can lose their infectivity with the specific inactivation rate kdvit contributing to the population of non-infectious virions. both Vddi and Vd deteriorate with the specific lysis rate kdvt. we neglected superinfection of Is and Ic as well as superinfection of Id and Ic by DIPs. values were selected based on previous parameters determined for IAV replication in animal cells. the coefficient of variation of parameters was determined using COPASI (Hoops et al., 2006) 5105 HEK-293T cells were seeded into 35 mm dishes. cells were washed with PBS and 3 mL Opti-MEM (Gibco) were added. plasmid contamination was 17.6% for A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and 0.8% for FL S1. but from zero h p.i. on the plasmid contamination was not detectable any longer, since the virus preparation was diluted due to the low MOI applied for infection. VB1 and VB2 were inoculated with 1.2106 viable cells/mL. they were grown in batch mode in 320 mL wv and 520 mL wv respectively. the 36 h RT was selected based on scouting experiments performed in shake flasks. trypsin (0.5 Units/L) was present in the feed medium of the virus bioreactors. samples were taken twice a day from VB1 and VB2 and once a day from CB. RTs were determined from the average viable cell count in CB. the maximum standard deviation of the HA assay was 0.15 log10(HA Units/100 L) and the dilution error of the TCID50 assay was 0.3 log10 (Genzel and Reichl, 2007). we determined the concentration of total virus particles CV in the supernatant based on the HA values. qPCR was performed using the Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) the primer pairs realtime-rev (GGAATCCCCTCAGTCTTC) and vRNA-tagRealtime-for (ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCG) for quantification of A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) and the primer pairs FL1-realtime-rev (CATTTCATCATCATTAAGTGCTGG) we calculated the concentration of virions that contain either A/PR/8/34-delS1(1) or FL S1 using Equations (2) and (3), respectively. a differentiation between infectious FL S1-containing virions (VS) and non-infectious FL S1-containing virions (Vd) is made. the extended model version describes explicitly the dynamics of replication-incompetent virions (DIPs) containing a deletion in S1 (Vddi) as described above. the infection of uninfected target cells (T) is considered separately for Vs and Vddi to account for DIP entry with subsequent DIP replication in case of a co-infection.

VB1 and VB2 were seeded at a similar concentration, but they reached 1.8106 cells/mL and 1.4106 cells/mL at time of infection. the infection took place at 50 h of culture at MOI of 0.1 and left in batch mode for another 23.4 h. cells infected by DIP only (red solid line), co-infected cells (dashed yellow line) in the virus vessels are shown for RTs of 22 h (C) and 36 h (D), respectively. the continuous culture was started 23.4 h p.i. this behavior is repeated for another 1 to 1.5 cycles within the cultivation time. the variation in the measured cell concentrations in the VBs did not follow the oscillating trend described for similar experiments. there are qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between model simulation and measurement of the total cell concentrations. experimental data based on reverse transcription-qPCR (open circles) and model fit (solid lines) are shown for (A,B) all virions containing FL S1 and (C,D) virions containing DI S1 (A/PR/8/34-delS1(1)) for both, experiment and model simulations, the continuous culture was started 23.4 h p.i. ions with 4.0109 virions/mL and 5.6109 virions/mL were reached at 1 day p.i. for RT of 22 and 36 h, respectively. for higher RT, the decrease in titers of FL S1 virions was delayed compared to RT 22 and reached its minimum of about 108 virions/mL at 11 days p.i. TCID50 titers were achieved around 3 days p.i. with 5.6107 virions/mL. maximum TCID50 titers were achieved around 3 days p.i. with 5.6107 virions/mL and 2.4108 virions/mL for RT 22 and 36 h. decreasing trend of peak HA titers is not reproduced by the model. if the model simulations lie within the biological variation of these experiments, it needs to be addressed when more experiments become available. the experimental DIP to STV ratio determined by dividing the DI S1 containing number of virions by the corresponding TCID50 titer (circles) is shown together with the simulated ratio according to Equation (11) the goodness of fit was similar to the full model (Model 1), both visually and quantitatively as based on the objective function values. experimental data (open circles) and four model fits (various lines) are shown for (A) TCID50 titer representing infectious virions of (B) the FL S1-containing virions as well as the sum of all viral subpopulations as log HA units (C) and DI S1-containing virions (D) vddiS 1.00105 1.15105 0.01 vdC 4.911016 3.131016 2.111013 2.821013 vdS 120 120 439 441 kdvit 1.58107 0 1.58104 0 kvdt 3.821027 0 6.301026 0 Objective function value# 8.50 8.49 7.99 8.00 # Objective function values are the normalized least squared prediction errors of the state variables of all cells Cellstotal, fully vdS 173 193 725 kdvit 0.07 0 4.35103 0 kvdt 2.02109 0 2.15108 0 Objective function values are the normalized least squared prediction errors of the state variables of all cells Cellstotal, fully infectious STVs VS, replication-incompetent DIPs Vddi, and non-infectious FL S1-containing virions Vd. model overestimated the TCID50 titer while underestimating the number of virions as well as the overall number of virions produced. the objective function value has decreased only by 6% or by 19% compared to that of Model 1 for the RT 22 h and RT 36 h respectively. model 4 showed fewer cycles due to exclusion of virus inactivation and degradation processes. model 4 showed quantitative deviations similar to Model 2. this underlines the importance of virus inactivation and degradation processes. kvi and kvidi estimates a lower specific DIP infection rate. based on a previously published model, we fitted the parameters of the model to the two sets of experimental data and determined their coefficient of variation (CoV) using Copasi (Table 1). for RT 22 h, low CoV (13%) were reached for parameter estimates of the specific growth rates for different viral subpopulations Vddi and VS, Vd. the high CoV values for estimates of the specific virus inactivation and lysis rates (kdvit, kvdt) indicated that these mechanisms can probably be neglected, which we also analyzed in more detail with respect to the different RTs. key parameter values estimated in this study were in the same order of magnitude as determined previously for adherent MDCK cells. VB1 and VB2 vessels operated at an RT of 22 and 36 h, respectively. RTs were adjusted using a constant feed of 12 mL/h of cell broth from the CB and 5.8 mL/h fresh medium into the virus bioreactors. the average concentration of target cells transferred from the CB to both VBs Tin was 1.13106 cells/mL. 106 cells/mL (standard deviation 0.30106 cells/mL) for RT 22 and 1.17106 cells/mL (standard deviation 0.22106 cells/mL) for RT 36 h, a tendency toward cyclic behavior was observed. this is linked to the simulated dynamics of the various cell populations caused by virus propagation. similar experiments by Frensing et al. (2013) using the avian AGE1.CR cell line infected with IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/34, MOI 0.025) for a RT of 25 h. there are qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between model simulation and measurement of the total cell concentrations. -delS1(1) produced in MDCK.SUS2 cells in a parallel continuous bioreactor system with residence times (RT) of 22 and 36 h. experimental data based on reverse transcription-qPCR (open circles) and model fit (solid lines) are shown for (A,B) all virions containing FL S1 and (C,D) virions containing DI S1. titers of FL S1 virions were delayed compared to RT 22 and reached its minimum of about 108 virions/mL at 11 days p.i. the second minimum for RT 36 h was reached once more about 2 days later. HA data indicate a trend for an overall decrease in amplitude of titers toward later cultivation time points for both RTs. maximum TCID50 titers were achieved around 3 days p.i. with 5.6107 virions/mL and 2.4108 virions/mL for RT 22 and 36 h, respectively. we decided to keep the model structure for now. more detailed studies regarding the dynamics of the individual cell populations will allow further improvement of the model. re-fitting model with model 2 resulted in a noticeable increase of the objective function value. re-fitting with model 2 resulted in a noticeable increase of the objective function value. every subfigure shows the four model fits using Model 1 containing all parameters (gray solid line), Model 2 with kdvit = kvdt = 0 (black dotted line), Model 3 with kvi = kvidi and kdvit = kvdt = 0 (line of black circles) for both experiment and model simulation, the continuous culture was started 23.4 h p.i. kdvit = kvdt = 0 Model 3, kvi = kvidi Model 4, kdvit = kvdt = 0 and kvi = kvidi kvi 5.38108 1.38107 2.89109 2.60109 kvidi 7.961011 1.161010 kvi kvi kcdv 0.003 0.002 0.001 0.001 vi 4.12 1.42 142 80 vddiC 177 experimental data (open circles) and four model fits (various lines) are shown for (A) TCID50 titer representing the infectious virions of (B) the FL S1-containing virions as well as the sum of all viral subpopulations as log HA units (C) and DI S1-containing virions (D) the objective function value has decreased only by 6% or by 19% compared to that of Model 1 for the RT 22 h (Table 2) and RT 36 h (Table 3), respectively. this suggests that two separate infection rates are needed to achieve good agreement with experimental data. the difference in kvi and kvidi is related to the underlying mass action kinetics of the model. the model estimates a lower specific DIP infection rate to yield an adequate amount of DIP-only and co-infected cells, and a high DIP titer in the supernatant. the model may still lack certain aspects or kinetics and therefore has room for further model extensions. PCR analysis of IAV segments 1-3 revealed that changes in the RT might also result in the accumulation of different DIP subpopulations in long-term cultures. the mathematical model established allowed to describe the time courses of the various viral and cellular subpopulations. the model may be extended further by accounting for the eclipse phase of virus release.
