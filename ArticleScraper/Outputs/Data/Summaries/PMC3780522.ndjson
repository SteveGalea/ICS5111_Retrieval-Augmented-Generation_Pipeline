{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) it is characterized by multifocal inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage [1\u20133]. it is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which exposure of genetically predisposed people to environmental factors triggers a breakdown in myelin-specific T cells. a few animal models exist in which viral infection triggers CNS demyelination. one neurotropic strain of MHV promotes demyelination even in the absence of B and T cells. mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 g MOG35\u201355 peptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) mice were scored daily for neurologic dysfunction according to a 0\u20135 scale. mice were inoculated intracranially with 50% LD50 dose of RSA59 strain. mice were sacrificed and perfused with 20 mL of PBS. the brains and livers were removed. all organs collected for viral titer were weighed and stored frozen at 80\u00b0C until titered for virus. brain and spinal cord tissues from infected mice were sacrificed and perfused transcardially with 40 mL of PBS followed by PBS containing 4% PFA. mice were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with H&E [39, 41] avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique stained spinal cords using 3, 3-diaminobenzidine as substrate. dilution of anti-CD45 (LCA; leukocyte common antigen, LY-5, BD Pharmingen), or CD3 (Dako, Richmond, VA, USA) mice were sacrificed at different days after immunization, and tissues were harvested for histology. RSA59 expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) which facilitates detection of viral antigen by fluorescence without tissue staining. left halves of the brain were placed directly into 2 mL of isotonic saline with 0.167% gelatin (gel saline) the remainder of the brain and liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and processed for histology. all organs collected for viral titer were weighed and stored frozen at 80\u00b0C until titered for virus. livers from the infected mice were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with H&E [39, 41]. 2.7. Immunohistochemical Analysis Serial sections from spinal cords were stained using the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique (Vector Laboratories) female C57BL/6 mice (n = 9) were immunized with MOG 35\u201355. data represent mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) generated from multiple animals in one experiment. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 20,000 PFU of RSA59 by intracranial inoculation. Typical CNS Inflammation in EAE Mice Histological analysis of EAE spinal cords was done as in prior studies [32, 33] and showed expected mononuclear cell infiltration (leukocyte common antigen (LCA) staining), demyelination (Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining) at all time points examined after disease onset. similar inflammation was present in other parts of the CNS, including the meninges of the brain and in comparison to day 6 spinal cords, days 9-10 cords demonstrate an influx of LCA and CD3 positive cells in the white matter. During the progressive phase, there is persistent LCA immunoreactivity, whereas CD3 is decreased. mid-sagittal sections of brains (5 m thick) at early and late phases post-inoculation were stained immunohistochemically with CD45 (LCA) there are both white and gray matters' infiltration by LCA immunoreactive cells that diminishes in intensity over time. at early phases post-inoculation, there are both white and gray matters' infiltration by deep cerebellar white matter. inflammatory CNS Pathology of RSA59 Pathology was assessed in sagittal brain sections and cross-sections from each spinal cord level at day 7 (peak inflammation) and day 30 (peak demyelination) after infection with RSA59. demyelinating plaques were detected by LFB staining at day 7 and spinal cords showed similar pattern of demyelination at day 30, but the number and area of plaques was larger. in viral-infected spinal cord there is an increase of Iba1+ cells. the distribution of these inflammatory cells varies significantly at different days after infection. in contrast to EAE, CD3+ cells are virtually absent. in the current studies, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (N = 30) were immunized with MOG35\u201355. mice were monitored daily for signs and symptoms of EAE for 30 days. onset of disease occurs between days 9\u201312. Mice were sacrificed at EAE onset, the progressive phase and at the peak of disease. mice were inoculated intracranially with 50% LD50 dose of isogenic recombinant strain RSA59 strain (20,000 PFU) as described previously. the efficiency of replication of RSA59 was determined in mice inoculated intracranially. the peak of viral replication was at day 5 similar to prior studies. average demyelination scores are shown in Table 1. representative cross-sections of spinal cords (5 m thick) were stained with Luxol fast blue (for myelin) and immunohistochemically for CD45 (LCA for inflammatory cells) and CD3 (for T cells) RSA59-infection (e)\u2013(h)) mid-sagittal sections of brains (5 m thick) at early and late phases after immunization were stained immunohistochemically for CD45 (LCA) there is mostly leptomeningeal (surface) and deep cerebellar white matter LCA immunoreactivity at early phases that decrease dramatically but remains in same locations at late time points. 0.0010 Chronic phase RSA59 (day 30) 12 72 100% 2.0 0.40 P 0.0001 Acute phase EAE (day 30) 20 100 85 1.88 0.99 P 0.0005 Chronic phase EAE (day 30) 10 60 80 2.25 0.85 P 0.0001 Table 2. Pattern and level of inflammation in EAE- and RSA59-infected mouse spinal cords. in spinal cord, at days 3 and 5, most LCA+ are Iba-1+ (microglia/macrophage marker) and these cells localize in both gray and white matters. by day 30, LCA+ and Iba1+ cells are present mainly in demyelinating plaques. by day 30, cells are present mainly in demyelinating plaques. at day 7 after inoculation, both gray and white matter are infiltrated by LCA positive cells. by day 30, LCA immunoreactivity is predominately localized to the white matter. inset in (e) shows higher magnification of rare CD3 immunoreactive lymphocytes. direct autoimmune inflammation along CNS white matter tracts and inflammation secondary to viral infection tracking can both produce similar demyelinating plaques. yelination [31, 34] provides insight into mechanisms operative in such a complex disease as MS."}
