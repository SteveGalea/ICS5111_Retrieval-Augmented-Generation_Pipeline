{"summary": "autopsy lung samples from nine SARS patients were subjected to triple-color sequential immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence staining on the same section. we found that the SARS antigen could be detected in six patients who died within 11 d after illness onset, but not in the other three patients who died 21, 24, or 27 d after disease onset. some SARS+ cells were actually \u201coverlapping\u201d with adjacent cytokeratin+ cells (e.g., one indicated by a circle in k), which might be mistakenly interpreted as \u201ccolocalized\u201d on two-dimensional images. but they could be carefully distinguished by adjusting the focus under the microscope.

CD34 is expressed by hematopoietic progenitors in the circulation (19) and also by bone marrow stromal cell precursors (20). similar observations were made in the bronchioles, i.e., SARS+ cells expressed both ACE2 and CD34. circles in a, b, and c indicate uninfected ACE2+CD34+ cells. Isotype antibody control for IHC, ACE2 sense control for FISH, and ISH for ISH are similar to e, f, and g. results are representative of six SARS patients. ACE2+CD34+Oct-4+ cells are present in non-SARS lung and express L-SIGN. the presence of viral antigen in CD68+ cells is most likely due to phagocytosis. ACE2+CD34+Oct-4+ cells can be infected by SARS-CoV ex vivo. cytokeratin+ cells (Fig. 3 A, e, f, m, and n, red) did not express ACE2 either. ACE2+CD34+Oct4+ cells also expressed L-SIGN (Fig. 3 A, p, purple), a binding receptor for SARS-CoV. ACE2+CD34+Oct-4+L-SIGN+ cells are present in non-SARS lung. it is unclear how the frequency of these putative stem/progenitor cells is regulated. DAPI counterstaining is in d. Circle in b indicates autofluorescence from red blood cells. some of the ACE2+CD34+Oct4+L-SIGN+ cells are close to surfactant A+ cells (g and k) or cytokeratin+ cells (p) panels of each row represent results on the same section of a patient. results are representative of eight patients with lung cancer. DAPI counterstaining is in f. Results are representative in four of six individuals enrolled. no CD34+ cells could be detected in samples from other two individuals. the ex vivo\u2013infected tissue blocks were fixed and embedded for IHC-FISH-ISH study. results showed that although few in number, SARS+ cells were identified in samples from four patients (Fig. 3 B, b and c, red, and Fig. S8 and S9) the major target for SARS-CoV in the SARS-infected lung is a novel subset of putative lung stem/progenitor CD34+Oct4+ cells. this is also the only cell subset in fresh non-SARS samples being infected after ex vivo infection. a recent report has shown that approximately one third of SARS-infected patients had self-limited symptoms with no clinical or radiological evidence of progression to pneumonitis. the origin of this novel putative human lung stem/progenitor cell is yet to be determined. some uninfected CD34+Oct4+ cells in the non-SARS lung are juxtaposed to the cytokeratin+ or surfactant+ cells. cells can be found in the non-SARS lung (Fig. 3 A) and can be infected by SARS-CoV ex vivo. it is also unlikely that these cells are recruited into the lung only as part of an attempt for viral clearance or are the only remaining cells bearing viral antigen by the time of death. the value and reproducibility of the nonhuman primate model for SARS infection are also highly disputable. autopsy lung samples from nine SARS patients were subject to triple-color sequential immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence staining on the same section. the phenotype of SARS+ cells in alveoli and terminal bronchioles do not express cytokeratin or surfactant. some SARS+ cells did not express cytokeratin or surfactant in alveoli (a\u2013f) and terminal bronchioles (j\u2013L), which could be mistakenly interpreted as \u201ccolocalized\u201d on two-dimensional images. number of SARS+ cells in fatally infected lung case no. Age (years)/Sex Mortality date (days after illness onset) 0\u20131 2 80/F 5 21 14 (9\u201342) 19 13 (939) 0\u20134b 3 91/F 9 7 3 (5\u201312) 7 3 (512) Nil, no detectable SARS+ cells in at least 20 fields (400) of each lung sample. cytokeratin+, surfactant+, or the epithelial membrane antigen\u2013expressing pneumocytes are targeted by SARS-CoV (6\u201312) cytokeratin+, surfactant+, or the epithelial membrane antigen\u2013expressing pneumocytes are targeted by SARS-CoV (6\u201312) cytokeratin+ is widely dispersed in mammalian tissues (15\u201317) results showed that the SARS+ cells did not express tryptase, defensins 1/2/3, CD15, CD68, CD57, CD45RO, and CD20, indicating they were not mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, NK, T, or B cells. similar observations were made in the bronchioles, i.e., SARS+ cells expressed both ACE2 and CD34. the majority of SARS+ cells in the alveoli were a subset of putative stem/progenitor cells expressing CD34, Oct-4, and ACE2. IHC on SARS autopsy lung for CD68 (brown labeling, some indicated by dark blue arrows in a) and for SARS-CoV antigen (red labeling, some indicated by dark blue arrows in a; also visible in b and c), followed by FISH for ACE2 ACE2+CD34+Oct4+ cells are present in non-SARS lung and can be infected by SARS-CoV ex vivo. ACE2 signals were detectable in samples from 8 of 14 lung cancer patients, but not in the others. cytokeratin+ cells (Fig. 3 A, e, f, m, and n, green) did not express ACE2 either. ACE2+ cells (Fig. 3 A, n, green) also expressed L-SIGN (Fig. 3 A, p, purple) chial/bronchiolar epithelial cells and CD34+Oct4+ cells are present in non-SARS lung and can be infected by SARS CoV ex vivo. the frequency of CD34+ cells in the non-SARS lung appears to be higher than that of SARS+ cells in the non-SARS samples. DAPI counterstaining is in h. (i\u2013L) IHC for surfactant A (brown labeling in i, one indicated by a yellow arrow; also visible in k) and for CD15 (red labeling, one indicated by a dark green arrow in i; also visible in j and k), followed by FISH for CD34 (green labeling in j, some indicated by light blue arrows) IHC-FISH-ISH study was performed in each sample before and after ex vivo infection. no CD34+ cells could be detected in samples from other two individuals. a number was obtained by counting CD34+ cells from five different fields. b Patients selected for ex vivo infection. part of fresh lung tissue collected from six lung cancer patients was cut into small blocks. infected samples where SARS+ cells were detected, an average of about two to three SARS+ cells per tissue section could be identified. the reason for few cells being infected in this model is unclear. it is also possible and remains to be investigated if these putative stem/progenitor cells represent a heterogeneous population that is still differentiating. the phenotype of the novel cell subset we identified in the human lung is not entirely compatible with those known mouse lung stem/progenitor cells. some CD34+Oct4+ cells in the non-SARS lung are actually juxtaposed to the cytokeratin+ or surfactant+ cells. this postulation can be supported at least in part by reports that circulation- or bone marrow\u2013derived cells may differentiate into mature respiratory epithelia in animals. preexisting injury may increase recruitment of adult bone marrow\u2013derived cells to the lung, which subsequently give rise to differentiated cells. if these cells are recruited into the lung only as part of an attempt for viral clearance or are the only remaining cells bearing viral antigen by the time of death. putative stem/progenitor CD34+Oct4+ cells are the major target for SARS-CoV infection in the human lung. we present clear evidence that putative stem/progenitor cells are the major target for SARS-CoV infection in the human lung. otides 454\u20131046 (GenBank accession no. NM002701) were used. ACE2 and L-SIGN (CD209L) probes were described previously. electronic images of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining were captured and saved to a computer using the software ACT-1 (Nikon) sections were treated with 0.2 N HCl for 30 min at room temperature to block alkaline phosphatase activity from the previous staining. sections were digested with 10 g/ml proteinase K at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Fig. S5 shows that SARS+ cells in bronchioles express both ACE2 and CD34. Fig. S7 shows that SARS-CoV antigen can be found in CD68+ cells. non-SARS lung samples were obtained from 14 patients fatally infected with SARS. sequenced immunostaining was performed on 5-m sections of formalin-fixed lung samples. samples were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated EnVision plus reagent. fluorescence staining was visualized under a fluorescence microscope (eclipse E600; Nikon) sections were treated with 0.2 N HCl for 30 min at room temperature to block alkaline phosphatase activity from the previous staining. sections were digested with 10 g/ml proteinase K at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Fig. S5 shows that SARS+ cells do not express most of the common leukocyte markers. Fig. S6 shows that SARS+ cells in bronchioles express both ACE2 and CD34. Fig. S7 shows that SARS-CoV antigen can be found in CD68+ cells."}
