{"summary": "monoclonal antibody therapy has been a game changer for cancer therapy, including treatments for lymphoma or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ (HER2+) breast cancer (1, 2). however, this approach has limitations, including slow development timelines, limited modification options, and short half-life for the molecules, requiring frequent repeat administrations. HER2 DNA-encoded BiTE (HER2DBiTE) effectively induces T cell cytotoxicity against HER2+ tumor cells, resulting in a high proportion of tumor regressions. results Design and expression of HER2dMAb. HER2dMAb bound to HER2 in a dose-dependent manner. HER2 is expressed in human ovarian cancer cell lines. HER2 is overexpressed in approximately 11.4% of ovarian cancer cells. HER2dMAb binds to HER2 in ovarian cancer cells. HER2dMAb mediates HER2 signaling blockade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. different mechanisms have been attributed to antitumor effects of anticancer antibodies. HER2dMAb blocks HER2 signaling, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and delays cancer progression in vivo. HER2dMAb blocks HER2 signaling, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and delays cancer progression in vivo. HER2dMAb sera effectively killed the ovarian cancer cells in the presence of PBMCs. no killing was observed against HER2\u2013cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231. HER2dMAb showed antibody-dependent phagocytosis activity. HER2dMAb inhibited tumor progression in this aggressive model of breast cancer. HER2dMAb also delayed tumor progression in this aggressive model of breast cancer. sera from mice after HER2DBiTE treatment showed an efficient dose-dependent cytotoxicity of OVCAR3 and CAOV3 cells. no cytotoxicity was found upon incubation with sera from empty vector\u2013treated mice. TE was observed in the absence of PBMCs. we encoded codon and RNA-optimized sequences for the heavy and light chains of pertuzumab into a modified pVAX plasmid expression vector. HER2dMAb was expressed at 5\u20136 g/ml, which we validated using RD cells. Western blot analysis of HER2dMAb or FSHR constructs expressed in 293T cells. HER2dMAb bound HER2 by flow cytometry only when ectopically expressed. HER2 is expressed in human ovarian cancer cell lines. HER2 is overexpressed in approximately 11.4% of ovarian cancers (11) HER2dMAb blocks HER2 signaling, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and delays cancer progression in vivo. HER2dMAb mediates HER2 signaling blockade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. HER2dMAb sera effectively killed the ovarian cancer cells in the presence of PBMCs. HER2dMAb sera effectively killed the ovarian cancer cells in the presence of PBMCs. HER2dMAb delays cancer progression in vivo. nude mice have no T cells but present enhanced NK and macrophage activity. splenocytes can lyse OVCAR3 in vitro in the presence of HER2dMAb. HER2dMAb (Supplemental Figure 1F) may contribute to its decline over time. we fused the scFv of the HER2dMAb with the scFv of an optimized sequence encoding anti-CD3 (modified UCHT1). this HER2BiTE retained binding to HER2 and bound to CD3. no cytotoxicity was found upon incubation with sera from empty vector\u2013treated mice. incubation of T cells with OVCAR3 at a 1:5 ratio with 5% sera (5 l in 100 l) showed that the DBiTEs exhibited potent activity for approximately 4 months. dMAbs have a series of advantages over the traditional protein antibodies. first, DNA is stabler than proteins. this higher stability simplifies storage and shipping because of the current strict cold chain requirement for antibodies. short half-life imposes BiTE therapy to be administered as continuous intravenous infusion for 4\u20138 weeks per cycle. HER2DBiTE, delivered by a simple injection lasting just milliseconds, was expressed in vivo for approximately 4 months. synthetic DNA delivery of BiTEs could alleviate the burden generated by the short half-life of BiTE therapy. dMAb-engineered sequences can be a starting point for development of improved BiTEs when launched from DNA cassettes (HER2DBiTE) dMAb-engineered sequences can be a starting point for development of improved BiTEs when launched from DNA cassettes (HER2DBiTE) HER2dMAb and HER2DBiTE engineered by encoding a codon-optimized sequence of the heavy and light chains of the anti-HER2 mAb pertuzumab. both antibody chains were positioned in sequence separated by a P2A and furin cleavage site. both constructs were subcloned into a modified pVAX expression vector. mice were treated by injecting 100\u2013200 g of DNA resuspended in 60\u201380 l of water into the tibialis anterior muscle (30\u201340 l per leg) with 200 IU/ml of hyaluronidase (MilliporeSigma) both antibody chains were positioned in sequence separated by a P2A and furin cleavage site. both constructs were subcloned into a modified pVAX expression vector ( a nonreplicative, nonintegrating plasmid designed for efficient delivery of DNA vaccines and mAbs (21, 22) we used empty modified pVAX plasmid as negative control. differences between the means of experimental groups were calculated using a 2-tailed, unpaired student\u2019s t test or 1-way ANOVA. repeated measures were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA. Error bars represent SEM. Survival rates were compared using the log-rank test"}
