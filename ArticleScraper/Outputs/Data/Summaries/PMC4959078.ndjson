{"summary": "most people live and work in densely populated environments that increase their exposure to airborne pathogens. the disinfection of airborne biological contaminants is important for eliminating transmission routes and ensure human safety (5). acy of ClO2 gas has been evaluated in previous studies. a previous study indicated the influence of RH on the antimicrobial effect of the ClO2 gas against foodborne pathogens on spinach leaves. there are no published models that can be used to describe the kinetics of inactivation of airborne pathogens by ClO2 gas. these models are needed to clarify the process of sterilization by ClO2 gas and to predict the range of treatment conditions that can achieve effective inactivation. the main goals of this study were to characterize and compare the behaviors of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus in regard to inactivation by ClO2 gas. ating 25-ml tubes containing 10 ml of nutrient broth (CM0001; Oxoid) with a single colony from the TSA plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. cultures were grown in NB (CM0001; Oxoid) on an incubator shaker (HNY-2102C; Honor, Tianjin, China) to obtain a spore suspension. a total of 10 l of bacterial or spore suspension prepared was spotted on the coupon in a biosafety cabinet. a total of 10 l of bacterial or spore suspension prepared was spotted on the coupon. the coupons were then air dried for 1 h at 23\u00b0C in the biosafety cabinet. each inoculated paper coupon was placed in a sealed centrifuge tube. coupons were inactivated under various gas concentrations and RH conditions. the temperature in the test chamber remained constant at 22 to 24\u00b0C. eight of the survival curves showed the inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus treated with 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter of ClO2 gas at a constant RH of 70%. each survival curve was generated from an experiment that consisted of five to seven samples taken at time zero and at selected time points during inactivation. td is the time required for d log reductions of the number of microorganisms. the parameter td can be obtained from the equation td = (d/b)1/n. survival curves were fitted using the function Linear Fit in OriginPro. all experiments were repeated three times using two samples per experiment. the data are presented as the mean values and standard deviations. differences between samples were determined using the analysis of variance with the SAS Statistics software. an aliquot (1 ml) of working culture was spread on sporulation agar plates at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. the medium contained 30 g nutrient agar (CM0003; Oxoid), 8 mg MnSO4 H2O (Jiangtian Ltd., Tianjin, China), and 1 g CaCl2 H2O (Jiangtian Ltd., Tianjin, China) the spores were gently dislo the prepared coupons were air dried for 1 h at 23\u00b0C in the biosafety cabinet. a pass box was connected to the chamber to mix the fumigant. the concentration of ClO2 gas in the chamber was continuously monitored. an inoculated, untreated control was used to calculate the initial number of CFU in each coupon. both controls and treated coupons were aseptically placed into sterile tubes containing 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (BR0014; Oxoid), 0.1% Tween 80 and a magnetic stir bar. inactivation curves were designed to achieve final population reductions of at least 6 log CFU. the first-order model assumes that the cells and spores in a population have the same resistance. the relationship between the decline in the number of survivors over the treatment time is linear. the model can be written as log10(N/N0) = btn, where is the RH parameter. the parameter td can be obtained from the equation td = (d/b)1/n. the model parameters are presented as the mean value and standard error. a greater-than-six-log reduction of spores was achieved after 90, 70, 50, and 30 min of treatment with 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter ClO2 gas. the curves are fitted using the first-order and weibull models. the inactivation kinetics were determined using the first-order and weibull models. the survival curves for S. albus in the test chamber treated with 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter ClO2 gas and a constant RH of 70% are shown in Fig. 3. maximum reductions of 6.15 0.60, 6.82 0.23, 6.46 0.40, and 6.34 0.39 logs were achieved after treatment with 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter ClO2 gas. survival curves for S. albus treated with different concentrations of ClO2 gas at 70% RH gas concn (mg/liter) the curves are fitted using the first-order and weibull models. survival curves for B. subtilis subsp. niger spores treated with different RH conditions (30, 50, 70, and 90%) and 2 mg/liter ClO2 gas RH (%) Weibull-H model was built to describe the survival curves under different RH conditions. the maximum R2 values were 0.93 for the first-order and weibull-H models. the survival curves for S. albus in the test chamber with 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH and a constant ClO2 gas concentration of 2 mg/liter are shown in Fig. 5. The largest reductions of 6.01 0.41, 6.25 0.51, 6.82 0.23, and 6.95 0.26 logs were achieved after treatment with 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. td = 1 (min) R2 MSE k (mean SE) D (min) R2 MSE 30 0.46 0.02 7.50 0.97 0.12 0.04 0.01 23.26 0.87 0.52 50 0.64 0.03 4.20 0.97 0.15 0.07 0.01 13.61 0.90 0.44 70 1 1.94 0.99 0.05 0.15 0.01 6.68 0.84 0.73 90 2.39 0.03 0.43 0.99 0.03 0.66 0.04 1.55 0.91 0.45 Relationship between the we calculated treatment times to achieve a six-log reduction. survival curves for B. subtilis subsp. niger spores in test chamber with 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter ClO2 gas and a constant RH of 70% are shown in Fig. 2. the curves are fitted using the first-order and Weibull models. the inactivation kinetics were determined using the first-order and weibull models. the time to a 1-log reduction for B. subtilis subsp. niger spores was expressed as the td = 1 value in the Weibull model and as the D value in the first-order model. 72 2 0.88 102 0.66 102 1.58 0.18 20.23 0.97 0.19 0.09 0.01 11.39 0.91 0.64 3 0.67 102 0.58 102 1.76 0.22 17.02 0.98 0.14 0.11 0.01 8.80 0.89 0.80 5 4.28 102 1.95 102 1.50 0.14 8.16 0.99 0.10 0.21 0.02 4.78 0.93 0.49 Inactivation of S. albus under different gas concentrations. the survival curves for B. subtilis subsp. niger spores in the test chamber with 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. the maximum log reductions for each survival curve were 6.28 0.31 following 180 min of treatment with 30% RH, 6.76 0.17 following 120 min of treatment with 50% RH, 6.81 0.30 following 70 min of treatment with 70% RH. the curves are fitted using the first-order and weibull-H models. based on the Weibull model established with 2 mg/liter ClO2 gas and 70% RH, the Weibull-H model was built to describe the survival curves under different RH conditions. the maximum R2 values were 0.93 for the first-order model and 0.99 for the weibull-H model. the survival curves for S. albus treated with different RH conditions are shown in Fig. 5. the largest reductions of 6.01 0.41, 6.25 0.51, 6.82 0.23, and 6.95 0.26 logs were achieved after treatment with 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH for 150, 90, 50, and 12 min respectively. the relationship between the RH and value is shown in Fig. 6. the relationship between the RH and value in the inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus was shown in Fig. 6. the ability of ClO2 gas at four different concentrations (1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/liter) to inactivate B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus during ClO2 gas inactivation Gas concn (mg/liter) RH (%) Time (min) both the first-order model and the Weibull model were built to evaluate the kinetics of inactivation of airborne pathogens. however, there have been few reports concerning the kinetics of inactivation of airborne pathogens in previous evaluations of the use of ClO2 gas as an air disinfectant. sensitivity to ClO2 gas differs for the same type of vegetative bacteria. the weaker or more sensitive members of the population are destroyed relatively faster, leaving behind survivors with higher resistance. ibull-H model produced a better fit to the survival curves. the increase in the RH accelerated the inactivation process but did not change the concavity of the curve. the RH parameter was specifically added in the weibull-H model. results showed that B. subtilis subsp. niger spores were more resistant to the ClO2 gas and required longer treatment times for effective inactivation than S. albus. the calculated time could be used to determine a treatment condition to achieve effective sterilization by ClO2 gas. however, the materials of the coupon significantly affected the inactivation effect."}
