{"summary": "timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections improves patient care and minimizes unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. we developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method for the rapid detection of RSV. results The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction."}
