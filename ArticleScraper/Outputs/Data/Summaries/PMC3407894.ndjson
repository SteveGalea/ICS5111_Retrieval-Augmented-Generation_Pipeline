{"summary": "pathogenic viruses are still the causative agents of many diseases in humans and other species. the most usual human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold (coronaviruses), influenza (influenza viruses), chickenpox (varicella zoster virus), cold sores (herpes) pathogenic viruses are also implicated in serious diseases, such as AIDS. they are also an established cause of cancer (papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus) clinical PDI was first applied to the treatment of herpes infection in the early 1970s. the procedures are limited to the treatment of papillomatosis, caused by human papillomatosis virus (HPV), like laryngeal papillomatosis [17] and epidermodysplasia verruciformis [18]. however, considerable progress has been made in the viral photodynamic disinfection of blood products. bacteriophages can be useful as surrogates of mammalian viruses. they can be grown to higher titers than most mammalian viruses. bacteriophages are more sensitive to photodynamic destruction than enveloped viruses. antimicrobial PDI PDI is a simple and controllable method for the inactivation of microorganisms based on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). this technology requires the combined action of oxygen, light and a photosensitizer (PS), which absorbs and uses the energy from light to produce those ROS. the majority of PS used is derived from tetrapyrrolic macrocycles known as porphyrins. rolic derivatives, such as toluidine blue O, rose bengal, eosin, methylene blue (MB) and fullerenes, were considered in many PDI studies. in order to be efficient, photosensitizing agents must bind specifically to vital viral components, such as lipid envelope (when present), the protein coat or to the nucleic acids. meso-tetraarylporphyrin derivatives HIV-1 6 log [79] HSV-2 6 log Metallo tetrasulfonated meso-tetraarylporphyrin derivatives HIV-1 2 log [36] HAV 4 log [44] meso-Tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin HAV >3.8 log [44] meso-Tetraki Adenovirus 7 log [76] Dengue virus 5\u20136.4 log [74] Enterovirus 71 8 log [85] Vaccinia virus 5 log [86] HIV-1 NQ [30] VSV 4\u20135 log Influenza virus NQ Sendai virus NQ Adenovirus 7 log [76] Buckminsterfullerene SFV 7 log [50] VSV 7 log Merocyanine 540 HSV-1 5\u20136 log [45] Bacteriophages G 5,10-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-15,20-bis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin T4 phage 1.4 log [66] 5,10,15-tris(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin T7 phage 1.7 log [88] Methylene blue Serratia phage kappa >4 log [61] f2 phage 2.2 log [ mechanisms of photodynamic inactivation are based on the ability of the PS to absorb energy from light and transfer that energy to molecular oxygen. in the dark, the electronic configuration of a PS exists in the so-called ground state. the excited PS molecule can decay to the ground state either by spin inversion followed by phosphorescence emission or by intersystem crossing. type II photooxidation is considerably less complex mechanistically than type I. in this pathway, the excited triplet state PS (3PS*) can transfer the excess energy to molecular oxygen (3O2) and relax to its ground state (1PS) creating an excited singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) [equation (9)] [69], creating an excited singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) [98,100]. singlet oxygen (type II mechanism) or free radicals (type I mechanism) is involved in the photodynamic process. simplest approach for determining whether singlet oxygen is involved in the photodynamic process is to study the inhibitory effects of various scavengers. the interception of the damaging species once formed is also a deactivation strategy of defence. o effect [106] Mannitol Little/no effect SOD Little/no effect Polyhydroxylated fullerene Glutathione (2.0 mM) SFV no effect [50] VSV no effect Hydroquinone (2.0 mM) SFV no effect [50] VSV no effect Merocyanine 540 Glutathione (10 and 30 mmol L1) HSV-1 30-50% [45] Cysteamine (10 and 30 mmol L1) 60 free radical species had, in general, little or no effect on the photoinactivation of the studied mammalian viruses. the rate of inactivation of HSV [45,84,106], influenza virus [108], semliki forest virus (SFV and VSV [50] in the presence of different PS and scavengers. meso-tetrakis(4--D-glucosylphenyl)porphyrin and 5,10,15-(4--D-galactosylphenyl)-20-phenylporphyrin seemed to be mediated by free radical species. highest inhibition was reached at about 1.0 mM of DMTU; further increase in scavenger concentration did not decrease slope of photoinduced inactivation of phages. singlet oxygen quenchers have been used to evaluate the specific involvement of type II mechanism during viral PDI with different PS. singlet oxygen quenchers used on mammalian viruses and bacteriophage PDI. singlet oxygen appears to be the most important mediator of virucidal activity on mammalian viruses. the rate of viral photoinactivation is significantly inhibited by oxygen removal or by addition of singlet oxygen quenchers. 1O2 is the main cytotoxic species involved in VSV photoinactivation. singlet oxygen is an important mediator of the toxic effect induced by PDI. however, the participation of free radicals cannot be ruled out. the rate of inactivation decreased 42% in the presence of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran. the symmetric derivative exerted its toxic effect mainly via free radical generation. this result may imply a synergism between singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical-mediated damages. singlet oxygen is an important mediator of the virucidal activity of these PS. the type II pathway is more important than the type I mechanism in phage PDI. there are only studies focusing on the simultaneous effect of singlet oxygen and free radicals scavengers. 1O2 is highly electrophilic and can interact with numerous enzymes. this leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis and molecular alteration of DNA strands. damage of different kinds caused to the viral envelope is important in the process of microbial inactivation. free radical scavengers have been used to evaluate the specific involvement of type I mechanism during mammalian viruses and bacteriophages PDI. scavengers have been used to evaluate the specific involvement of type I mechanism during viruses and bacteriophages PDI.

DMTU did not completely inhibit T7 phage PDI. singlet oxygen quenchers used on mammalian viruses and bacteriophage PDI. singlet oxygen quenchers used to evaluate specific involvement of type II mechanism during viral PDI with different PS. singlet oxygen appears to be the most important mediator of virucidal activity on mammalian viruses. the rate of viral photoinactivation is significantly inhibited by oxygen removal or by addition of singlet oxygen quenchers. photoinactivation of bacteriophage M13 was inhibited from 1.72 log to 0.54 log by sodium azide in a quencher dose-dependent mode, up to a concentration of 3.5 mM. however, photoinactivation occurred even in the presence of sodium azide, suggesting that both type I and type II mechanisms may be involved in the M13 photoinactivation process. asymmetric 5,10,15-(4--D-galactosylphenyl)-20-phenylporphyrin was used in the presence of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran. irradiation of polyhydroxylated fullerene suspensions in the presence of -carotene reduced the photoinactivation rate of PRD1 and T7 phages, suggesting singlet oxygen involvement. some data about the importance of type I and II mechanisms in PDI of bacteriophages are discrepant. in general, it seems that the type II pathway is more important than the type I mechanism in phage PDI. a few studies focusing on the simultaneous effect of singlet oxygen and free radicals scavengers under the same protocol of viral PDI. VSV no effect [50] VSV no effect Hydroquinone (2.0 mM) SFV no effect [50] VSV no effect Merocyanine 540 Glutathione (10 and 30 mmol L1) HSV-1 30-50% [45] Cysteamine (10 and 30 mmol L1) 60-70% SOD (1.5 to 29 U mL1) no effect Methylene blue Mannitol (100 mM) HSV-1 24% [84] Glycerol (10 free radical species had, in general, little or no effect on the photoinactivation of the studied mammalian viruses. the rate of inactivation of HSV [45,84,106], influenza virus [108], semliki forest virus (SFV and VSV [50] in the presence of different PS and scavengers. phyrins varied according to the structure of the PS and the concentration of dimethylthiourea (DMTU) the highest inhibition was reached at about 1.0 mM of DMTU. however, DMTU did not completely inhibit the efficacy of the PS. free radical species had, in general, little or no effect on photoinactivation of the studied mammalian viruses. the rate of inactivation of HSV [45,84,106], influenza virus [108], semliki forest virus (SFV) and VSV [50] in the presence of different PS and scavengers like glutathione, D-mannitol, glycerol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and hydro in [87] seemed to be mainly mediated by free radical species. highest inhibition was reached at about 1.0 mM of DMTU. but DMTU did not completely inhibit phage PDI. singlet oxygen quenchers used on mammalian viruses and bacteriophage PDI. singlet oxygen quenchers used to evaluate specific involvement of type II mechanism during viral PDI. singlet oxygen appears to be the most important mediator of virucidal activity on mammalian viruses. the rate of viral photoinactivation is significantly inhibited by oxygen removal or by addition of singlet oxygen quenchers. photoinactivation of bacteriophage M13 was inhibited from 1.72 log to 0.54 log by sodium azide in a quencher dose-dependent mode, up to a concentration of 3.5 mM. however, photoinactivation occurred even in the presence of sodium azide, suggesting that both type I and type II mechanisms may be involved in the M13 photoinactivation process. the rate of inactivation decreased 42% in the presence of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran. it can be concluded that the type of PDI mechanism depends on the PS structure, with the symmetric derivative exerting its toxic effect mainly via the generation of free radicals. singlet oxygen seems to be the most important mediator of virucidal activity on mammalian viruses. the rate of viral photoinactivation is significantly inhibited by oxygen removal or by addition of singlet oxygen quenchers. singlet oxygen seems to be the most important mediator of virucidal activity. photoinactivation of bacteriophage by MB was inhibited from 1.72 log to 0.54 log by sodium azide in a quencher dose-dependent mode, up to a concentration of 3.5 mM. however, photoinactivation occurred even in the presence of sodium azide, suggesting that both type I and type II mechanisms may be involved in the M13 photoinactivation process. asymmetric 5,10,15-(4--D-galactosylphenyl)-20-phenylporphyrin was used. the toxic effect occurred mainly via free radical generation. irradiation of polyhydroxylated fullerene suspensions (40 M) reduced photoinactivation rate of PRD1 and T7 phages. a detailed photophysical and photochemical study of the interactions between the toxic species generated by the PS and key biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids is essential for the knowledge and prediction of photosensitization process efficiency. the primary target of PDI depends on the chemical structure of the PS, the targeted virus and the mechanism of photoinactivation [64]. guanine is the most susceptible component to suffer a type I photosensitization reaction. it is known that cationic porphyrins can bind to nucleic acids via intercalation into base pairs or self-stacking. porphyrin binding to DNA is not a prerequisite for an efficient photosensitization. damage in the DNA of Mammalian Viruses Viral DNA is thought to be a critical target structure for PDI by MB and light. MB plus light treatment of HSV-1 gives rise to DNA damage and blocks DNA replication. phage was just as capable of generating progeny virus as the untreated controls. the observed DNA damage is not correlated with loss of phage infectivity. treatment of M13mp2 DNA with increasing concentrations of MB yielded increasing amounts of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodguo) MB and phthalocyanine derivatives inactivated VSV and inhibited fusion of the virus envelope with Vero cells. the degree of inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation. there is no correlation between RNA damage and loss of infectivity. inactivation of purified RNA by MB and light, in the absence of proteins, most likely occurs due to oxidative damage to the RNA at the site at which MB is bound. there are no studies specifically focusing on the damages induced by PDI in both mammalian viruses and bacteriophages under the same PDI protocol. enveloped viruses are more easily inactivated than non-enveloped ones. the enveloped viruses used in PDI protocols were only assayed for their protein alterations. the results of PDI obtained by Lytle et al. are in good accordance with what is reported in literature about the major contribution from lipids for the viral photoinactivation process. the PS per se can induce alterations in the folding of some enzymes. these alterations lead to changes in properties such as solubility, proteolytic susceptibility, absorbance, and fluorescence emission of several of their amino acids. these alterations are mainly mediated by hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical generation. membrane proteins cross-links Rose bengal [30] p24 and gp120 proteins; protein cross-links MB [34] Inhibition of cell fusion activity of Env proteins Natural and sulfonated tetraarylporphyrins [36] VSV Loss of infectivity; loss of fusion function; cross-linking of G and M proteins Hypericin [30]. Merocyanine 540 [47] Viral capsid protein Hypericin [133] Friend erythroleukemia virus Viral envelope (reduce ability to adhere to and penetrate host cells) Enterovirus 71 Appearance/disappearance of protein bands. loosening of protein-DNA interaction Glycoconjugated meso-tetraarylporphyrins [87] Capsid and core proteins. the same treatment is reported to be ineffective against some non-enveloped viruses. the proteins in the viral envelope of HSV-1 were considered to be major targets of merocyanine 540 photosensitization. some phthalocyanine derivatives have been shown to induce cross-links in HSV protein that might be responsible for the observed loss of infectivity. the degree of this inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation (43% inhibition vs. 4.7 log or 99.998% inactivation, for MB) abe and Wagner also found few changes in the relative abundance of VSV G protein after MB and alPcS4 phototreatment. enterovirus 71 PDI was also due to damages in the viral genome [85]. photoinactivation by merocyanine 540 of four bacteriophages, two non-enveloped phages without lipids (phi X174 and T7), a non-enveloped phage with lipids (PRD1) and an enveloped phage with an external lipoprotein envelope (phi 6) was studied. high propensity for MS2 phage inactivation by this PS may arise from damage to its A protein. oxidative cross-linking of capsid proteins induced by singlet oxygen is likely cause of phage inactivation. phototreatment pointed to significant alterations in the protein structure and/or in the protein-DNA interaction, which may be the cause of photodynamic inactivation. the RNA genome of Q bacteriophage contained sufficiently lethal lesions following MB plus light exposure to account for the resulting phage inactivation. however, the protein component of the phage somehow contributes to the inactivation of the phage. guanine is the most susceptible component to suffer a type I photosensitization reaction. it is known that cationic porphyrins can bind to nucleic acids via intercalation into base pairs or self-stacking. porphyrin binding to DNA is not a prerequisite for an efficient photosensitization. damage in the DNA of Mammalian Viruses Viral DNA is thought to be a critical target structure for PDI by MB and light. MB plus light treatment of HSV-1 gives rise to DNA damage and blocks DNA replication. DNA damage is not correlated with loss of phage infectivity. 100% of closed circular DNA was recovered from MB-treated phage. treatment of M13mp2 DNA with increasing concentrations of MB yielded increased amounts of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine. MB and phthalocyanine derivatives inactivated VSV and inhibited fusion of the virus envelope with Vero cells. the degree of inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation. there is no correlation between RNA damage and loss of infectivity. guanine is the most susceptible component to suffer a type I photosensitization reaction due to the fact that it exhibits the lowest oxidation potential among DNA bases. cationic porphyrins can bind to nucleic acids via intercalation into base pairs or self-stacking, inducing lesions upon photoinactivation. porphyrin binding to DNA is not a prerequisite for photosensitization. free porphyrins are more effective in virus inactivation than the DNA-bound species. damage in the DNA of Mammalian Viruses Viral DNA is thought to be a critical target structure for PDI by MB and light. DNA damage was not correlated with loss of phage infectivity. the observed DNA damage is not correlated with loss of phage infectivity. 100% of closed circular DNA was recovered from the MB phage. treatment of irradiated phages with MB and aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate caused strand breaks and piperidine-labile bonds in DNA. strand cleavage was found to be MB concentration and light dose dependent processes. however, DNA damage was not correlated with loss of phage infectivity. damage in the RNA of mammalian Viruses VSV was damaged by 30 g mL1 of a chlorophyll derivative and red light illumination. guanine is suggested as the major target for oxidation by photosensitizing agents and light. there is no correlation between RNA damage and infectivity loss. RNA genome exhibited sufficient lethal lesions to account for phage inactivation. however, the protein component of the phage exerted some effect in viral PDI. no direct relationship between photodynamically induced RNA damage and viral inactivation was described. a chlorophyll derivative and red light illumination caused a decrease of as much as 85% in RNA polymerase activity. MB and phthalocyanine derivatives inactivated VSV and inhibited fusion of the virus envelope with Vero cells. the degree of inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation. there is no correlation between RNA damage and loss of infectivity. extracted phage RNA with MB and light caused a loss of activity in the infectious RNA assay. results showed that Q RNA infectious activity is significantly more affected by photoinactivation in its protein-associated virion state as compared with its purified isolated polymer state. the envelope may be a more important target than nucleic acids for photosensitization. however, no studies focus on the degradation of viral envelope lipids after PDI or even on other viral internal lipids. enveloped viruses are more easily inactivated than non-enveloped ones. the formation of cross-linked/aggregated material appears to be a major consequence of photosensitized-mediated protein oxidation. the formation of protein cross-links is not a primary photodynamic event, but a secondary reaction between the photooxidation products of sensitive amino acid residues. these protein modifications lead to changes in properties such as solubility, proteolytic susceptibility, absorbance, and fluorescence emission of several of their amino acids. cyanine derivatives [132] HIV Major capsid protein p24 Hypericin [111] HIV-1 Loss of infectivity; loss of fusion function; membrane proteins cross-links Hypericin [30] Loss of infectivity; loss of fusion function; membrane proteins cross-links Rose bengal [30] p24 and gp120 proteins; protein cross-links MB [34] Inhibition of cell fusion activity of Env proteins Natural and sul Vaccinia virus Histidine residues in virus proteins Rose bengal [86] Merocyanine 540 [45] Sindbis virus Viral envelope (reduced ability to adhere to and penetrate host cells) Merocyanine 540 [47] Viral capsid protein Hypericin [133] Friend erythroleukemia virus Viral envelope (reduced ability to adhere to and penetrate host cells) the same treatment is reported to be ineffective against some non-enveloped viruses. however, the results from Wong et al. showed that even a non-enveloped virus can be efficiently inactivated due to the damage induced by PDI to its viral proteins. VSV was inactivated by MB and phthalocyanine derivatives, which inhibited the fusion of the virus envelope to vero cells. however, the degree of this inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation (43% inhibition vs. 4.7 log or 99.998% inactivation, for MB) enterovirus 71 was significantly altered after a low dose PDI and a MB concentration 0.5 M. however, enterovirus 71 PDI was also due to damages in the viral genome. the survival curves of the different viruses showed different levels of sensitivity. phage composition resulted from differential resistance to singlet oxygen by the outer structures. PRD1 has a double capsid with an internal lipid membrane, whereas T7 has a single proteinaceous capsid lacking lipids. both phages contain double stranded DNA with similar GC content. the damage of T7 nucleoprotein is a complex process and clearly both phage DNA and protein capsid are affected by photoreactions. the protein component of the phage somehow contributes to the inactivation of the phage. d proteins and did not disturb protein-DNA interaction. same treatment is reported to be ineffective against some non-enveloped viruses. results from Wong et al. showed that even a non-enveloped virus can be efficiently inactivated due to the damage induced by PDI to its viral proteins. VSV was inactivated by MB and phthalocyanine derivatives, which inhibited the fusion of the virus envelope to vero cells. however, the degree of this inhibition was small compared to the extent of virus inactivation (43% inhibition vs. 4.7 log or 99.998% inactivation, for MB) bis viruses by hypericin lead to extensive cross-linking of envelope proteins. protein profile of enterovirus 71 was considerably altered after low dose PDI. but enterovirus 71 PDI was also due to damages in the viral genome. oxidative cross-linking of capsid proteins induced by exogenous singlet oxygen is the likely cause of phage inactivation. the high propensity for MS2 phage inactivation by this PS may arise from damage to its A protein, which is necessary for infecting its host Escherichia coli. photomodification of core proteins can also lead to phage inactivation, even if the primary structure of the DNA part is preserved. the damage of T7 nucleoprotein is a complex process and clearly both phage DNA and protein capsid are affected by photoreactions. the development of increasing numbers of antiviral agents has provided the clinician with therapeutic options previously unavailable. drug resistance is costly to the health service, to the patient who fails to gain maximum therapeutic benefit, and for the community in which resistant viruses may be spread. there is now an urgent need for the development of novel, convenient and inexpensive measures to combat antimicrobial-untreatable infections. antimicrobial PDI exhibits serious and irreversible damage of microorganisms. damage does not allow creation or operation of any kind of anti-drug or mutagenic mechanism. up until now, no photosensitization-resistant mutants have been found. a T4-like phage did not recover its viability after exposure to Tri-Py+-Me-PF during 120 min of irradiation. this finding comes as no surprise since the mechanisms of action of AZT and light-activated benzoporphyrin derivative are different. -10,15,20-tris(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (Tri-Py+-Me-PF) at 5.0 M under white light irradiation showed no changes in the rate of photoinactivation during the course of the experiments. if phage resistance would occur, important reductions on phage photoinactivation efficiency would be detected between experiments. symmetry and the size of the chain of meso substituent groups also affect the photodynamic effect. the adjacent positive charges in the PS macrocycle should result in a molecular distortion due to electrostatic repulsion. a synthetic PS can be manipulated in order to enhance its interactions with the structural features of the viruses. inactivation of the fusion activity of VSV, influenza and Sendai viruses was reached with nanomolar concentrations of hypericin and rose bengal. inactivation of HAV to 3.6 log with anionic symmetric porphyrin meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin required 90 min [44]. the rate and extent of inactivation appeared to vary with the nature of the meso substituent groups meso-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin and 5-(pentafluorophenyl)-10,15,20-tris(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin lead to complete T4-like phage inactivation (7 log) after 270 min of irradiation with 40 W m2. the presence of a lipophilic aryl group in one of the meso positions of the porphyrin core appears to have an important role in phage inactivation. the presence of a lipophilic aryl group in one of the meso positions of the porphyrin core appears to have an important role in phage inactivation. non-laser light sources, such as LED, have also been applied in PDT. some studies indicate less damage at low fluence rate, others indicate more killing at lower, compared to higher fluence rates. a reduction in the fluence rate lowers the rate of oxygen consumption. relatively low fluence rates can be nearly as effective as high fluence rates. lower doses of PS require higher activating light fluences. lower doses of PS require higher activating light fluences. cationic porphyrin derivatives (meso-tetrakis)porphyrin and 5-(pentafluorophenyl)-10,15,20-tris (1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin) were irradiated with different sources of light. all light sources tested lead to reductions of about 7 log for the somatic T4-like phage. phage survival ratio can also be considered as a decreasing exponential fraction of the light fluence. the location and binding site of the PS is an important factor in microbial PDI. positively charged PS are generally more efficient and can act at lower concentrations than neutral and anionic PS molecules. the toxicity of a synthetic PS can be modulated by the introduction of selected substituents on the macrocycle periphery. the physicochemical properties of a synthetic PS can be manipulated in order to enhance its interactions with the structural features of the viruses, such as viral capsids. the amphiphilic nature of a PS is another important feature affecting PDI efficiency. inactivation of HAV to 3.6 log with anionic symmetric porphyrin meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin required 90 min [44]. the rate and extent of inactivation appeared to vary with the nature of the meso substituent groups. tetracationic porphyrin showed similar results in another study. a concentration-dependent effect was also detected with a porphyrin derivative. a further increase in porphyrin concentration did not lead to a higher inactivation rate of T7 phage. the rate and extent of inactivation appeared to vary with the nature of the meso substituent groups. PDI complete inactivation of VSV (4.2 log) can be obtained by treating it with 1.0 M of the anionic phthalocyanine derivative AlPcS4 and 5 min illumination with red light. phage photoinactivation varied according with the PS concentration. tetracationic porphyrin derivatives are more effective in viral inactivation than dicationic porphyrins. meso-tetrakis(1-alkylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin derivatives with different alkyl substituent groups were tested for MS2 phage inactivation. a further increase in porphyrin concentration did not lead to a higher inactivation rate of the phage. non-laser light sources, such as LED, have also been applied in PDT. a reduction in the fluence rate lowers the rate of oxygen consumption. a reduction in the fluence rate lowers the rate of oxygen consumption. a reduction in the fluence rate lowers the rate of oxygen consumption. if the number of light photons bypasses the number of PS molecules, the PS will no longer be able to absorb the photons \u201cin excess\u201d and the rate of PDI will not increase. if the number of photons is higher than this limit, the antimicrobial effect will decrease because the dye in suspension will not absorb all the excess light. higher power densities produce high rate of viral inactivation than low fluence rates. red light of 9 W m2, given at a total dose of 1.8 104 and 3.2 104 J m-2, inactivated MB-treated VSV by 6 and 7 log. only one study focusing on the effect of different light sources and power densities [67] exists. the efficacy of T4-like phage inactivation was dependent on the light source used. the results also showed that increasing the concentration of a PS at a fixed light dose leads to increased viral inactivation as does an increase in the total light exposure at a fixed PS concentration. higher power densities produce a high rate of viral inactivation than low fluence rates. red light of 9 W m2, given at a total dose of 1.8 104 and 3.2 104 J m-2, inactivated MB-treated VSV by 6 and 7 log. only one study focusing on effect of different light sources and power densities [67] exists. acy of T4-like phage inactivation was dependent on the light source used. increased concentration of a PS at a fixed light dose leads to increased viral inactivation as does an increase in the total light exposure at a fixed PS concentration. singlet oxygen and free radical species were identified as important contributors for an effective viral PDI. there are few studies simultaneously comparing the contribution of both types of mechanisms involved in viral PDI. the primary targets for the photoinactivation of viruses are the outer structures. the inactivation of mammalian viruses and phages can be attained at micromolar-level PS concentrations. different light sources and fluence rates are equally effective, depending on the final dose at which the viruses are exposed to. similarity of the results obtained for mammalian viruses and bacteriophages shows that they exhibit a similar behaviour when submitted to viral photoinactivation techniques. type (DNA or RNA) in the photoinactivation efficiency. it will also be important to study the synergistic effect between viral PDI and antiviral classical methodologies."}
