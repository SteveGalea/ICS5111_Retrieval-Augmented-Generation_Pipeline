{"summary": "pathogens cause acute respiratory infections are highly variable, including most predominantly viruses, as well as fungi and phylogenetically diverse bacteria. rapid and accurate detection of respiratory pathogens is important for timely clinical management, reduction of improper antibiotic abuse, and prevention of outbreaks and epidemics. advances in molecular biology have improved clinical pathogen detection dramatically. multicolor probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis was developed to overcome these limitations. the principle of the fluorescent probe melting curve is to distinguish between PCR template sequences based on differences in the melting point temperature (Tm) when probes hybridize with PCR products. this differentiation increases detection flux of each fluorescent detection channel greatly. the remaining 384 throat swabs from patients with respiratory infections identified by culture and immunofluorescence were used for methodological evaluation. nucleic acid extraction Pathogen RNA/DNA molecules were extracted with a commercial reagent (TIANamp virus DNA/RNA kit; Tiangen, China) the sequences of the molecular beacons and primers were synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by Sangon (Shanghai, China) the sequences of the molecular beacons and primers used are listed in Table 1.

Reaction I (primers and probes for IFV-A, IFV-B, hRSV, hMPV, PIV-1-3, hCov 229E, and hRV) was performed with 2.5 L 10 RT-PCR reaction buffer, 0.25 mmol/L dNTP, 3.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 U Taq enzyme, 40 U Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 10 U fluorescence was recorded on 6-carboxyfluorescein and indodicarbocyanine-5, carboxy-X-rhodamine, and hexachlorofluorescein channels. melting curves were obtained by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence with respect to temperature versus temperature (-Rn\u2019) RNA standards for the nine viruses in reaction I were constructed with a commercial in vitro transcription reagent. the assay was run with a temperature program that has two stages, namely amplification and melting. it was necessary to select primer sets and molecular beacons that were compatible with each other. a total of 47 positive clinical samples were used in specificity testing. probes targeting hRV, IFV-A, and IFV-B were labeled with carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) in reaction II, six pairs of primers and six probes were mixed. the probes targeting ADV and hBov were labeled with FAM. hRSV (n = 21, 5.47%), hRV (n = 11, 2.86%), PIV3 (n = 8, 2.08%) and ADV (n = 8, 2.08%) were not detected in these samples. 5 of 92 positive samples (5.43%) were shown to be co-infections. multiplex PCR assay development We set out to produce a two-tube multiplex real-time PCR assay to be used in combination with melting curve analysis. the assay was run with a temperature program that has two stages, namely amplification and melting. in reaction I, nine pairs of primers and nine probes were mixed. the probes targeting hCov 229E, hMPV, and hRSV were labeled with indodicarbocyanine-5 (Cy5) and IFV-A were labeled with carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) in reaction II, the limits of detection for hRSV, hMPV, PIV-1-3, and hRV were 500 copies/L. the limits of detection for BP, LP, and MP were 50 copies/L. the limit of detection for CP was 5 copies/L. 0 100 100 1.000 (P 0.001) - 0 380 IFV-B + 3 0 100 100 100 1.000 (P 0.001) - 0 381 hRSV + 21 0 98.4 77.8 100 0.867 (P 0.001) - 0 381 PIV-1 + 3 0 100 100 100 1.000 (P 0.001) - 0 381 PIV-2 + 1 0 100 100 100 1.000 (P 0.001) the detection limits of this assay ranged from 5 copies/L to 5 102 copies/L at the nucleic acid level. the method was used to detect 15 pathogen species in 384 clinical samples. the results were validated by comparison with conventional culture method results. the method has a number of advantages, including rapidity, sensitivity, specificity, and low cost, which should facilitate its acceptance in clinical and public health laboratories."}
