{"summary": "progression of respiratory viral infections from the upper to the lower respiratory tract occurs most frequently with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and influenza viruses (2, 3). both assays are cleared only for testing on nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. ages ranged from 25 to 89 years old, with 25 liquid-tumor patients and 20 solid-tumor patients. most common symptoms included radiological evidence of lung abnormality and fever and cough. metrix X Parainfluenza virus 2 Zeptometrix X Parainfluenza virus 3 Zeptometrix X Influenza virus A H1 Zeptometrix X Coronavirus NL63 Zeptometrix X Coronavirus NL63 Zeptometrix X Respiratory syncytial virus Zeptometrix X Bordetella pertussis Zeptometrix X Mycoplasma pneumoniae Zeptometrix the eS RVP was performed as previously described for NPS specimens but using 300 l of raw specimen instead of NPS specimens (4). three hundred microliters of the treated specimen was then tested using the FA RP. the difference between the FA RP and the eS RVP was statistically significant (P 0.0001) the difference between the eS RVP and the eS RVP was statistically significant (P 0.0001). the difference between the eS RVP and the eS RVP was statistically significant (P 0.0001). the significance of dual infections is unclear and seems to depend on which viruses are present. both RSV A and B subgroups may circulate during a given respiratory season, and coinfections likely occur, although rarely reported, probably due in part to the lack of discrimination of current testing methods. the clinical presentation does not seem to be different from that for patients infected with a single influenza virus type (13, 14). the same conclusion was reached for eS RVP, since the LOD was lower (10-fold) than that of the FA RP for all targets except hMPV, for which the LOD was equal. for the eS RVP, the percent agreement for all replicates of each target on each instrument was 100% except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. the percent agreement for the Tm ranged from 0.17 to 0.49%. the eS RVP is a low-throughput, sample-to-result system. the eS RVP has several steps prior to detection on the XT-8 platform. the choice and implementation of either platform will depend on each laboratory test volume, workflow, and available space."}
