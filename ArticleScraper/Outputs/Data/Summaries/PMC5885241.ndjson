{"summary": "influenza activity in the northern hemisphere from November 2014 to early 2015 was mainly caused by the influenza A H3N2 virus. a similar phenomenon occurred with the 2015 vaccine for the southern hemisphere leading to the low effectiveness of vaccine protection. obstructive azoospermia, chronic lung disease, bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. prior spirometry, with severe airflow limitation and reduction of forced vital capacity, is presented in table 1. he was admitted to the emergency room of the hospital de Clnicas de Porto Alegre, with continuous fever for 2 days. hematocrit, 10.2g/dL hemoglobin, 22,660 leukocytes/mm3, 2% band-shaped, 86% segmented, 6% monocytes, 5% monocytes, 1% metamyelocyte, 95mg/dL urea, 2.37mg/dL creatinine (prior it was 0.79mg/dL), 6.6mEq/L potassium, 3.2mmol/L lactate, 145mg/ antiviral coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam and intravenous tobramycin was initiated based on the sensitivity test of the last bacteriological examination of the sputum. after 48 hours of hospitalization, oseltamivir evolved with respiratory failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit. angiotomography of the thorax excluded the possibility of pulmonary embolism. the antibiotic scheme was modified to meropenem and polymyxin B. he experienced progressive clinical improvement of his respiratory condition. the identification of the influenza A virus was made via molecular biology testing of the nasopharynx aspirate. however, subtyping of the H3N2 virus was not performed. the viral identification of the reported case most likely corresponds to influenza A H3N2. renal hypoperfusion and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome have been the most frequently reported cause. rhabdomyolysis has been the most frequently reported cause."}
