{"summary": "the death certificate includes information on disease directly leading to death, antecedent causes, and other major conditions contributing to death. the coding is reviewed by a committee to finalize the national public data provided to the users. nationally, 90% of all deaths were certified in 1987, and almost 100% of deaths were certified by 2007 (14,15). the p value for a 2-sided test for which the true average of the APCs was zero was calculated based on a t distribution. we obtained population denominators according to age and education level from the Korean Population and Housing Census data. we selected information from the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 to use as population denominators for calculating mortality rates according to education levels. we categorized education levels as middle school or less, high school, and college or higher. ranked 1983 2015 Infectious disease No. deaths Mortality rate* Infectious disease No. deaths Mortality rate* 1 Tuberculosis 7,853 23.7 Respiratory tract infections 15,030 19.5 2 Respiratory tract infections 5,286 15.1 Sepsis 3,045 4.0 3 Intestinal infections 1,314 4.3 Tuberculosis 2,209 3.0 4 Central nervous system infections 1,244 3.1 Intestinal infections 670 1.0 5 Vaccine-prevent the average APC for 1983\u20132015 was \u20139.41, reflecting a significant decrease from 124.2 to 4.1 deaths/100,000 population. among persons age >65 years, the average APC did not vary significantly during this period (APC 1.44), but the APC increased significantly during 2007\u20132015. TB-related mortality rates decreased during 1983\u20132015. mortality attributable to respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, empyema, and influenza) increased from 15 to 20 deaths/100,000 population. sepsis mortality increased from 1 to 4/100,000 population.
