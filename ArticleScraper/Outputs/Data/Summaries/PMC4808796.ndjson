{"summary": "RNA virus genomes can be either double-stranded or single-stranded. each segment encodes one viral protein, or unimolecular, in which a single polyprotein is translated and cleaved to form individual viral proteins. RNA viruses have diverse modes of replication that largely depend on their genome configuration. retroviruses are a unique class of RNA viruses whose lifecycles contain a DNA intermediate that requires integration into the host cell genome prior to viral gene expression. the retrovirus genome consists of two identical positive-strand RNA molecules of between 7 and 12 kb that are capped at the 5' end and polyadenylated at the 3' end. viral reverse transcriptase enzymes are used to generate double-stranded DNA molecules from the RNA templates. the rapid and accurate repair of DNA lesions is vital for cellular survival and for the maintenance of genome stability. if not accurately repaired, DNA damage can cause erroneous changes in the genetic code leading to increased mutational load and an elevated risk of developing cancer. -PK are primarily activated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) while ATR is stimulated at regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated at DSBs or stalled replication forks. a single cell can accumulate up to 10 endogenously-induced DSBs per day. the DSB sensor complex recruits and activates the transducer kinase ATM at the site of the break. active ATM is then able to phosphorylate downstream effector proteins of the DDR including histone H2AX as well as cell cycle checkpoint proteins p53 and CHK2. ubiquitination of histones H2AX and H2AX by the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 precedes the recruitment of kinases ATM, ATR, CHK1 and CHK2 can activate the G1/S checkpoint by phosphorylating and inactivating the phosphatase Cdc25A which prevents the activation of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. ATM can also signal through an alternative pathway during S-phase requiring the MRN complex and phosphorylation of structure maintenance of chromosome 1. non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair. DSB is first recognised by the Ku70/80 heterodimer, which forms a ring-like structure. the nucleoprotein filament searches for the undamaged sister chromatid. it is used as a template for filling in the missing information on the damaged strand. the nucleoprotein filament can result in branched structures known as Holliday junctions that must be resolved by endonucleases. gap filling is carried out by the DNA polymerases Pol and Pol in conjunction with PCNA and ligation by the ligase III-XRCC1 complex. the MLH1/PMS2 (MutL) complex is recruited followed by the exonuclease EXO1 which resects the damaged strand. human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Vpr protein can promote apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex. this may contribute to depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes in vivo. apoptosis occurring prior to production of infectious progeny will have a detrimental effect on viral propagation. RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit or delay the process. RNA processing proteins such as DICER and AGO2 inhibit repair of damaged DNA. a variety of possible roles for the DDRNAs have been proposed. long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are also expressed following DNA damage. cellular ubiquitin E3 ligases to target significant DDR proteins for rapid proteasome-mediated degradation. other viruses are recruited to adenovirus replication centres where they are involved in viral DNA synthesis [68,69,70]. a summary of interactions between RNA viruses and the cellular DDR is also presented in Table 1. a summary of interactions between RNA viruses and the DDR is also presented in Table 1. retroviral integration and the DDR Retroviruses are a unique class of intracellular parasites that include HIV-1 and HTLV-1. retroviruses must reverse transcribe their RNA genome and integrate the subsequent DNA intermediate into the chromosomes of host cells. the viral integrase protein is essential in this process as it catalyses the removal of two nucleotides from the 3'ends of the viral DNA. the infection of murine cells lacking DNA-PK resulted in reduced viral DNA integration and high levels of apoptosis. the NHEJ pathway has also been implicated in the circularisation of unintegrated viral DNA that would otherwise be sensed as DNA damage by the cell. there has been considerable disagreement over the role of PARP-1 in retroviral integration. several studies have claimed that this enzyme is essential for HIV integration [126,127,128] while others have stated that it is dispensable [119,123,129]. the process of post-integration repair may be separate from classic DNA repair pathways which raise the possibility of inhibiting this process while leaving important cellular functions intact. HIV-1 is well known as the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) which develops via the progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells. the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the HIV-1 genome could selectively enhance the translation of viral proteins during G2 arrest. the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the HIV-1 genome could selectively enhance the translation of viral proteins during G2 arrest. exposing cells to agents that typically induce ATR/CHK1 activation, such as UV and hydroxyurea, resulted in Cdc25A degradation and S-phase arrest. accumulation of cells in G2 is mediated by Vpr in a mechanism that is distinct from that induced by DNA damage or replication stress. recruitment of Vpr and SLX4 following Vpr-SLX4 binding was shown to cause premature activation of SLX4-associated MUS81-EME1 endonucleases. the presence of Vpr and SLX4 also suppressed induction of type 1 interferon by HIV-1. the ability of Vpr to cause cell cycle arrest in G2 is a well-established phenomenon. tax protein HTLV-1 is another member of the retroviridae family. it encodes regulatory and accessory proteins that include a 40 kDa viral transactivator known as Tax. tax can disrupt cell cycle progression, introduce DNA damage and interfere with DNA repair. tax can impair the recruitment of MDC1 to repair foci and reduce phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA by enhancing expression of the cellular phosphatase WIP1 [98,173]. tax can also accelerate S-phase progression through interaction with the MCM2-7 complex and replication origins. HTLV-1 tax causes DNA damage in host cells through elevated oxidative stress and stimulation of unregulated DNA replication. it also undermins cell cycle checkpoints and multiple DNA repair pathways. HCV is hepatotrophic and causes acute and chronic hepatitis. BER, and to a lesser extent NER, are responsible for the reversal of oxidative damage to DNA. reduced expression of the NEIL1 glycosylase involved in cleaving damaged bases during the initial steps of BER. hepatocytes expressing the entire HCV open reading frame exhibited defective cell cycle arrest and reduced NER through the down-regulation of Gadd45 [185] IBV infection can inhibit cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in both wild type and p53-null cells. inhibition of ATR by RNA interference and small molecule inhibitors reduces coronavirus replication. ribonucleoprotein complexes encode 11 viral genes. the negative-sense viral RNA is transported to the nucleus. it provides a template for production of positive-sense mRNA molecules. it is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation of viral proteins. RNA viruses have the potential to introduce genetic instability during the course of infection. the exact mechanism by which DNA lesions are inflicted is often difficult to establish. changes that lead to enhanced cellular proliferation can result in replication-induced DNA damage that fails to trigger cell cycle arrest or activation of DNA repair pathways. the NSs protein of another member of the Bunyaviridae family, the La Crosse virus (LACV), inhibits the type 1 interferon response through degradation of the RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 [109] there is evidence that selective activation of DDR components by NSs could be crucial to promoting RPB1 proteasomal degradation. RNA viruses can also acquire a survival advantage by targeting specific DDR proteins. specific cases regarding interactions between RNA viruses and the DDR are less numerous than in DNA viruses. there is no doubt that more examples and layers of complexity will emerge as the field develops."}
