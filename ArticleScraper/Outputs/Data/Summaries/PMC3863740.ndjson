{"summary": "the pathogenesis of CLAD remains unknown with no effective treatments. thus, the identification and avoidance of CLAD risk factors is critical. the role of aberrant CXCR3/ligand biology causing persistent allograft injury. pathologists according to international multidisciplinary Consensus Statement on Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (DAD and OP) and international Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria (AR and LB) were graded as present or absent until March 1, 2009. LB was graded as present or absent until March 1, 2009, and thereafter graded according to the revised 2007 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria (29, 36) allograft mortality was defined as death or retransplant. a biopsy described as ungradable was considered a missing value. a subset of patients were consented for the collection of BAL fluid. for each of the injury patterns, the cumulative count increased from zero to one at the first episode of injury, from one to two at the second episode, and so forth. the univariable models included other plausible demographic variables associated with poor clinical outcomes. age greater than 70, male sex, single lung transplant, pretransplant diagnosis, and time of transplant. there were 328 (21%) biopsies with a perivascular AR pattern in 199 (45%) recipients. there were 468 (30%) biopsies with LB from 245 (56%) recipients, 134 (8%) biopsies with OP from 92 (21%) recipients. Table 1 lists the patient characteristics by whether or not they ever had an episode of DAD. AR = acute rejection (grade A2 or higher); DAD = diffuse alveolar damage; LB = lymphocytic bronchiolitis, OP = organizing pneumonia. IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; HTN = hypertension; LAM = lymphangioleiomyomatosis; PLCH = pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. a single episode of DAD was associated with the highest risk of CLAD. single lung transplant 1.35 0.99 1.85 1.39 1.01 1.91 Dx: CF 0.50 0.19 1.36 Dx: COPD 1.07 0.77 1.50 Time of Tx: first tertile 0.68 0.43 1.07 Time of Tx: second tertile 1.00 0.66 1.52 Definition of abbreviations: AR = acute rejection; CF = cystic fibrosis; CI = confidience interval; CLAD = chronic lung allograft dysfunction; COPD = chronic AR was the only injury pattern associated with the development of RAS. the 5-year incidence of CLAD was 86% in recipients with at least one episode of DAD versus 43% in recipients with. allograft mortality was defined as death (n = 189) or retransplant (n = 8) in the univariable models, only DAD (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.6\u20134.4), AR (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.6), LB (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.3), OP (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3\u20131.7), CLAD (HR, 4.1; 95% 72 1.25 1.05 1.48 CLAD 4.14 3.01 5.69 3.27 2.32 4.60 Age >70 1.76 0.98 3.17 2.08 1.09 3.98 Male sex 1.24 0.93 1.66 Single lung transplant 1.19 0.90 1.58 Dx: CF 0.21* 0.05 0.85 Dx: IPF 1.14 0.86 1.51 Dx: COPD 1.04 0.77 1.40 Time of Tx: first tertile 1.35 0.87 2.09 Time of Tx: second tertile median time from DAD to allograft mortality was 278 days. allograft survival = freedom from death or retransplant. most common was viral infection: cytomegalovirus. BALF CXCL9 concentrations were 19-fold higher during DAD, fourfold higher during AR, and threefold higher during LB as compared with \u201chealthy\u201d biopsies. meanwhile, the increases were less pronounced. all three CXCR3 ligand concentrations were associated with an increased risk of CLAD. ten-fold increases in CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were associated with HRs of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.1\u20131.9), 1.45 (95% CI, 1.1\u20131.9), and 2.25 (95% CI, 1.1\u20134.6), respectively. CXCL9 and (B) CXCL10 expressed from allograft airway bronchial epithelial cells (green arrows), subepithelial (dark blue arrows) and interstitial (light blue arrows) infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages (black arrows) there were 1,928 bronchoscopies with TBBXs from 441 transplant recipients. seven hundred and ninety-one (50%) biopsies from 441 (100%) recipients had no evidence of histopathology. the prevalence of the histopathologic injury patterns varied by the time from transplant. 3.6 2 3.8 Pulmonary HTN 12 3.1 7 13.5 Non-CF bronchiectasis 11 2.8 \u2014 0.0 AAT deficiency 9 2.3 1 1.9 Sarcoidosis 8 2.1 3 5.8 BOS 5 1.3 2 3.8 LAM 3 0.8 \u2014 0.0 PLCH 1 0.3 \u2014 0.0 Other 1 0.3 1 1.9 Induction ATG 215 55.3 32 61.5 Basiliximab 173 44.5 19 36.5 HRs represent the increase in risk for a single episode of the injury. HRs represent the increase in risk for a single episode of the injury. HRs represent the increase in risk for a single episode of the injury. multivariable model includes only the variables listed: DAD, AR, LB, single lung transplant. we further evaluated the association between the injury patterns and the phenotypes of CLAD (BOS and RAS) in subset analyses among double lung transplants. the 5-year incidence of CLAD was 86% in recipients with at least one episode of DAD versus 43% in recipients with no episodes of DAD. the median time from DAD to CLAD onset was 149 days. diagnosis (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.05\u20130.9) were all significant predictors of allograft mortality (Table 4). only DAD (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7\u20133.0), CLAD (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3\u20134.6), OP (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.5) and age greater than 70 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1\u20131.5) remained significant the 5-year incidence of allograft mortality was 78% in recipients with at least one episode of DAD versus 41% in recipients with no episodes of DAD. the median time from DAD to allograft mortality was 278 days. BALF concentrations of Chemokines during DAD, AR, and LB predicted CLAD development. we assayed 496 BALF samples from 224 recipients. 325 \"healthy\" samples from 194 recipients, 20 DAD samples from 18 recipients, 70 AR samples from 56 recipients. XCL10 115.3 206.8 0.0211 221.2 0.0112 212.7 0.0007 CXCL11 81.1 95.5 0.0221 83.8 0.5370 83.7 0.0990 Definition of abbreviations: AR = acute rejection; BALF = bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; DAD = diffuse alveolar damage; LB = lymphocytic bronchiolitis. both CXCL9 and CXCL10 were expressed by airway bronchial epithelial cells, subepithelial and interstitial infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages. in contrast, CXCL11 was predominately expressed by vascular endothelial cells. analyzed 1,585 TBBXs from 441 LTRs and found that DAD was associated with the highest risk of subsequent CLAD (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9\u20134.7) and death (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7\u20133.0) the association between DAD and CLAD would be mediated by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligand biology. non-PGD-associated episodes of DAD (>15 d post-transplant) were strongly associated with RAS (HR, 6.5; 95% CI, 3.3\u201312.5) and BOS (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1\u20132.8) chemokines recruit mononuclear cells through their shared receptor, CXCR3 leading to allograft fibroplasia. inhibition of CXCR3 or its ligands resulted in a profound attenuation of allograft rejection and dysfunction. chemokines move to the sites of lung allograft injury along a CXCL9 and/or CXCL10 chemokine gradient. this compartmentalization of chemokines may explain the contradiction of CXCL11. the major limitation of this study is the potential for confounding inherent to retrospective studies. this study evaluated serial BALF and histopathology in 224 LTRs. the findings represent a first step in elucidating a mechanism linking DAD to CLAD. future studies should investigate the involvement of this chemokine pathway and other cytokine pathways."}
