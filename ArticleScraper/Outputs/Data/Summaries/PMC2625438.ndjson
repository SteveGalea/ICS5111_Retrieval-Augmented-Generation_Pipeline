{"summary": "cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls. the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). kungungya fever (CHIKV) is an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family. it is transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (mainly A. albopictus and A. aegypti) CHIKF is an acute illness with abrupt fever, skin rash, arthralgia, and occasional involvement of the nervous system. CHIKV-induced arthritis or arthralgia is of immunopathologic origin. there is no specific or effective treatment for CHIKF, and patient management is largely symptomatic relief and primarily anti-inflammatory drugs. a global analysis of their specific involvement with disease severity has not yet been defined. all 10 patients included in this study were males. their age ranged from 22 to 65 years (median, 35 years) all except one were foreign nationals. myalgia a Severity was defined as having a temperature >38.5\u00b0C or pulse rate >100/min or platelet count 100109/L. b Clinical outcome at 2 weeks post-illness onset. most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%), and conjunctivitis (40%) the mean peak alanine and aspartate transaminases (ALT and AST) were 5836 U/L and 5025 U/L respectively. both ALT and AST were 2-fold greater than the upper limit of normal in one patient, who had pre-existing liver cirrhosis. none of the patients had a clinically abnormal total protein, urea or creatinine level. a two-way hierarchical clustering analysis was done to characterize the overall patterns. the samples collected ranged from day 2 to day 19 of illness (median, day 4.5) the levels of 8 plasma cytokines were observed to be most significantly elevated in CHIKF patients compared to uninfected subjects (P0.05). -12, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-, and TNF-, were only marginally increased in the CHIKF group compared with those in the uninfected group. each cell in the 2-dimensional graph indicates the measure of a single mediator in 1 sample, with standardized levels indicated by color according to the scale on the top. levels of IL-1, IL-6 and RANTES respectively were associated with disease severity. differences in cytokines, chemokines and growth factors levels determine disease severity. the distinction between non-severe and severe CHIKF has only been reported in Singapore. our patients were similar to those reported in recent outbreaks [6]\u2013[9], [11]\u2013[14], [16]\u2013[18], [21], [30], indicating that although people are genetically diverse response to diseases is homogeneous across people in non-homogeneous populations. the majority of our patients was 45 years and had no pre-morbid condition. the profile of circulating cytokines revealed a predominance of Type 2 cytokines. mainly IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were increased and those of IFN- or TNF- were unchanged as compared to non-infected controls. this suggests that acute CHIKV infection tilts the cytokine profile to anti-inflammatory response, which would argue against the common understanding of CHIKV infection. the detection of IL-7 and IL-15 is significantly interesting with regards to the immunopathology of CHIKF. 9 of the 10 patients manifested this pathology. IL-7 is known to have an important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. IL-15 has been associated with the development of joint inflammation. higher disease severity was associated with increased plasma levels of IL-1 and IL-6 and a decreased level in RANTES. higher disease severity was associated with increased plasma levels of IL-1 and IL-6 and a decreased level in RANTES. thrombocytopenia can also reduce levels of RANTES. RANTES levels were up-regulated in dengue [48], except for one single report from Cuba [52]. a wide spectrum of disease has been reported in CHIKF ranging from asymptomatic infections to self-limiting febrile illness [8], to neurologic complications, and death [17]. follow-up studies will be required to determine if long-term sequelae are indeed different between non-severe and severe clinical presentations. the study strongly suggests these biomarkers be used for measuring disease severity and be tested in outbreaks in different populations and different strains. a patient was defined as having severe illness, if he had a maximum temperature of more than 38.5\u00b0C, or a maximum pulse rate of more than 100 beats/minute, or a nadir platelet count of less than 100109/L. plasma samples from 9 healthy volunteers were also included as controls. complexes were washed twice with a vacuum manifold before incubation with biotinylated detector antibody for 1 h at RT \u00b0C. complexes were then washed thrice and incubated with wash buffer for another 3 min before detection in the Luminex 200TM instrument. results were acquired by the IS 2.3 software and the standard curves were plotted through a five-parameter logistic curve setting. the equation: Statistical Analyses Comparisons between groups were calculated by Mann-Whitney rank sum. the equation: Statistical Analyses Comparisons between groups were calculated by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison tests. patients and clinical samples were included in this study. plasma samples from 9 healthy volunteers were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until analyses were done. multiplex biometric immunoassay containing fluorescent dyed microspheres conjugated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a target protein. the raw cytokine values were normalized using z-score conversion based on the formula: where is the raw value to be converted, is the mean of the population and is the standard deviation (SD) of the population. the values are subjected to cluster analysis [55] to yield an ordered NumOfRows.x NumOfCols expression level matrix, Eel. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison tests. P values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant."}
