{"summary": "CDC recommends screening patients who traveled to endemic countries for fever, respiratory symptoms, and exposure to MERS-positive contacts and healthcare facilities. we implemented a travel screening questionnaire in our electronic medical record (EMR) to identify high-risk patients in order to implement early isolation practices. electronic screening of patients is an efficient way to identify high-risk travelers. this tool could be modified for other emerging pathogens, such as measles or Ebola."}
