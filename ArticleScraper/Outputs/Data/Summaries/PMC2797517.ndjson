{"summary": "the seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been described relatively recently. increased understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality has taken on new urgency due to climate change. seasonality of infectious diseases of public health importance is driven by temperature. emergence of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactam agents, macrolides, and other antibiotic classes is an important clinical concern. a more thorough understanding of the effect of environmental factors on seasonal IPD incidence could offer significant insight into pathogenesis, improve disease forecasting, and help determine the likely direction of pneumococcal disease incidence. both methods reduce confounding by environmental, behavioural, and infectious influences that might otherwise distort the observed magnitude of environmental effects on disease risk. arithmetic means of the air quality values were used as exposure variables. UV index forecast estimates for Philadelphia during the same period were retrieved from the national weather service climate prediction center [21] the phase-shift of the composite waveform generated by combining sine and cosine components of the above equation can be approximated as the arctangent of 2/3. we also included model terms that controlled for longer term trends in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, which may have reflected the initiation of surveillance. a \"case\" is a day on which a case occurred. a \"control\" is an appropriately selected day on which a case did not occur. hazard periods were defined as the reported date of IPD onset from Philadelphia County public health. UV index forecast estimates for Philadelphia during the same period were retrieved from the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center [21]. the issued UV index represents an integral of measured UV radiation levels weighted by the ability of the different UV wavelengths to cause skin erythema. we used models that incorporated both linear and quadratic yearly terms. the quadratic model term was statistically significant, but is difficult to interpret. we present our final Poisson model with separate linear yearly terms. starting on January 1, 2002 the person-time at risk was divided into three-week time strata. control periods were chosen by matching the hazard period by day of the week within the stratum. the 1-3 day incubation period of S. pneumoniae was used to estimate the lag days between acute environmental occurrence and case onset. spectral decomposition and construction of autocorrelograms identified annual periodicity of infection, with peak incidence in mid-February (phase = 6 weeks) no significant heterogeneity was detected between age groups with respect to year-on-year trends in incidence or case-fatality. the curve depicts expected incidence of disease occurrence based on a multivariable Poisson regression model. reported cases are seasonal (wintertime predominant); incidence increases sharply in 2002 and 2003 with the introduction of mandatory reporting. risk of IPD increased with several seasonally oscillating environmental exposures.

Spectral density is represented on the y-axis. the large peak at a frequency of 51 weeks suggests invasive pneumococcal disease is a process that oscillates with annual periodicity. the two peaks at lower frequencies are lower harmonics illustrating bi- and tri-annual behaviour. temperature, and clear-sky UV index were independently associated with case occurrencein a final multivariable model. risk increased with increasing maximum temperature, but decreased with cooling degree days, indicating a threshold of 18\u00b0C. oling degree days are defined as the number of degrees a daily mean temperature is above 24\u00b0C. a day with an average temperature of 27\u00b0C would have 3 cooling degree-days. no heterogeneity in UV effects was found when evaluated in individuals aged over 64 as compared to younger individuals. no other significant associations between environmental exposures and risk were identified either during the incubation period, or in the period immediately prior to incubation. occurrence of IPD was not affected by daily changes in clear-sky UV index, temperature or cooling-degree days. invasive pneumococcal disease remains an important source of population morbidity and mortality. invasive pneumococcal disease remains an important source of population morbidity and mortality. the association between low UV radiation in the winter and surges in respiratory disease has been noted previously [33], and has not to our knowledge been evaluated in a way that accounts for coincident seasonal changes in other seasonally oscillatory factors. an important consideration is whether changes in UV radiation, operating at a weekly time scale, constitute a biologically plausible mechanism. vitamin D deficiency is associated with a marked increase in the risk of pneumonia [37], and most human vitamin D is acquired via sun exposure. the week-to-week fluctuations in risk described in this paper may be too rapid to represent a vitamin D effect. an alternative mechanism of action of UV radiation in reducing IPD risk could be direct effects on pathogen survival. we suspect that this increase is less likely to represent a true surge in disease rates, which have actually been falling in the U.S. with the introduction of 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. we suspect that this increase, which is more attenuated after 2003, represents the gradual increase in reporting that commonly follows implementation of new infectious disease reporting requirements. study is needed, but this result is consistent with observed patterns of respiratory infectious disease. the implications of these findings for future pneumococcal disease epidemiology are unclear. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
