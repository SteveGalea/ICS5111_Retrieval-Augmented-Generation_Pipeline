{"summary": "initial investigations included a complete blood count (with a differential count), serum biochemical measurements (including electrolytes, renal and liver function values, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) the cause of the virus was not known at the onset of the outbreak. routine microbiologic cultures of sputum, urine, and blood were done to rule out common bacterial causes of pneumonia. hea - - - - + - Sore throat - + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - x-ray findings Right basil infiltrates Right basal infiltrates Right upper lobe infiltrates Left upper lobe infiltrates RT-PCR ND Positive Positive Positive Positive Outcome Survived Died Survived Survived Survived Survived Survived a M, male; F, female; HCW, healthcare worker. case-patient 3 was an ICU physician who performed a bronchoscopy on case-patient 2 on march 26. he became ill with fever, headache, and myalgia on march 29. his initial chest x-ray was clear, and his fever resolved transiently for 30 hours before recurring. case-patient 6 was identified as the index case-patient for the outbreak. she had fever, headache, and myalgia 3 days later. her chest x-ray changes occurred on day 5 of illness. patient 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Hemoglobin (g/dL) 10.9 12.5 13.4 14.1 12.0 16.3 12.1 Leukocyte count (X10-9/L) 4.52 19.34 5.3 14.65 5.41 9.29 10.14 Lymphocyte count (X10-9/L) 0.78 0.94 0.71 1.02 0.53 0.63 0.21 Platelet count (X10-9/L) the primary abnormalities were patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. three patients had upper lobe infiltrates. five of the patients were admitted to the hospital with normal chest x-ray results. he became ill with fever, headache, and myalgia on march 29. his initial chest x-ray was clear, and his fever resolved transiently for 30 hours. subsequent chest x-rays showed right lower-lobe infiltrates that went on to involve both lung fields. he eventually required intubation and ventilatory support in the ICU. case 2 A woman 43 years of age was admitted to the hospital on march 23. she had had fever, headache, vomiting, and coughing for 7 days and diarrhea on the first day of her illness. she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she died on march 31. chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with bilateral lung infiltrates. he was admitted to the general medical ward with probable congestive heart failure. but a transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction. the patient became critically ill and was transferred to the ICU. leukocyte count was normal in nine cases-patients. mild thrombocytopenia was observed in two cases-patients. lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in eight cases-patients. patient 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Hemoglobin (g/dL) 15.0 8.4 11.2 12.5 14.3 13.2 13.5 Leukocyte count (X10-9/L) 3.73 7.2 4.94 6.3 3.6 6.2 6.76 Lymphocyte count (X10-9/L) 0.83 1.34 1.04 0.30 0.84 1.13 0.97 Platelet count (X10-9/L) 121 163 167 231 176 184 240 ALT (U/L g Hospital for further management to keep the hospital free of the virus. current diagnostic guidelines may not be sufficiently sensitive for assessing patients before admission to hospital. a temperature of >38\u00b0C is part of the diagnostic criteria (2), but this symptom was notably absent in two patients. patients without a contact history are still isolated if the clinical suspicion is high. a national computerized database of SARS patients and their contacts has been established to assist with this process. an epidemiology team is also used to perform more exhaustive contact tracing and liaison with other healthcare facilities. our hospital structure of open wards with large numbers of beds separated by curtains may have been a contributory factor to the spread of the virus. despite continued community transmission of SARS in Singapore, the measures implemented since April 8, 2003 enabled us to identify and contain eight additional SARS cases."}
