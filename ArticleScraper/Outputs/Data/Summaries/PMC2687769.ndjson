{"summary": "the biography of a bacillus is a classic in microbiology. it tells the tale of that dreaded disease typhus, its reservoir in rats and its transmission among humans by lice. it is a tale of infidelity that I will begin with the recent research on lice of David Reed and colleagues. the new acquisitions were originally derived from zoonotic infections but have flourished as self-sustaining infections in the human population. the majority of zoonoses, however, remain in their animal reservoirs and, so far as their sojourn in humans goes, we can regard them as 'temporary exhibits' a shared habitat, rather than a shared ancestry, is important for the acquisition of many infections. most human pandemic infections were acquired horizontally very recently on evolutionary timescale. the market for 'bushmeat' has led to Ebola virus outbreaks in africa from butchering primates. the closest relative to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz), but it would be facile to suggest that HIV-1 co-evolved with humans. molecular clock estimates place the most recent common ancestor of the pandemic form of HIV-1 at 75\u2013100 years ago. new world clade of head louse may have crossed horizontally from H. erectus to H. sapiens within the last 100,000 years. a third clade of head lice has been delineated in Ethiopia and Nepal. this clade diverged from clades A and B about 2 MYA. phylogenetic analysis shows body lice evolved from head lice several times within the worldwide clade A. aristocracy and gentry shaved their hair and wore wigs to protect them from lice. in 17th and 18th century Europe, most of the gentry shaved their hair and wore wigs. anthropologists disparage the theory that humans evolved through an aquatic stage. apes belong to a different genus, Pthirus, from head and body lice. apes have variants of both Pediculus and Pthirus and lost one or the other. logeny indicates that human pubic lice diverged from gorilla lice as recently as 3.3 MYA [3], whereas the chimp and human host lineage split from the gorilla lineage at least 7 MYA. the crab is then found on the eyelashes of the infant. pubic lice are said to be the most contagious of all sexually acquired infections. the prevalence of infestation by pubic lice seems to be decreasing among women and men who remove their pubic hair using 'bikini wax' 8% of the human genome represents 'fossil' integrated proviruses. the parasite would gain a whole new lease of evolutionary opportunity if it engaged in occasional 'infidelity', analogous to mutation in DNA replication. ape-to-human transfers of HIV-1 have taken off to cause the AIDS pandemic [11] only one of the three ape-to-human transfers of HIV-1 has taken off to cause the AIDS pandemic. it pays the host to place barriers known as restriction factors. anopheles gambiae has also coevolved to be a specialist feeder on humans. the other human malaria parasite, P. vivax, has an origin in south east Asian monkeys and is transmitted by the more promiscuous Culex species. humans have two herpes simplex viruses (HSVs), types 1 and 2. phylogenetic analysis indicates that HSV-1 and HSV-2 are further apart from each other than HSV-1 is from its chimp ortholog [27] predators can pick up parasites from their prey. there is a danger that the surviving great apes may be subjected to a coup de grace from human infections transmitted through jungle safaris and ecotourism. the surviving great apes may be subjected to a coup de grace from human infections transmitted through jungle safaris and ecotourism. Typhus is known as 'war fever' and 'jail fever' because it appears in conditions where lice thrive. typhus is known as 'war fever' and 'jail fever' because it appears in conditions where lice thrive."}
