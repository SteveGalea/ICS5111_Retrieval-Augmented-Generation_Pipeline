{"summary": "entry is the first hurdle a virus must overcome for a successful infection. a major structural distinction is the presence or absence of a lipid bilayer surrounding the viral nucleocapsid. enveloped viruses must fuse their envelope with a host cell membrane. influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin binds an attachment receptor, sialic acid, and undergoes low-pH-triggered fusogenic conformational changes upon endocytosis. most enveloped viruses thus contain multiple copies of only one or two glycoproteins, which mediate viral attachment and entry into target cells [5\u201315] HSV-1 contains 15 viral proteins in its lipid envelope, 12 glycosylated and three unglycosylated. four of these glycosylated proteins are essential for entry into target cells in tissue culture and in animal models. gC and gG promote entry at the apical side of polarized epithelial cells. other envelope proteins (gE, gI, gM, gN, and UL45) have roles in cell-to-cell spread and membrane fusion. gD, gH, gL, and gB are not only essential for HSV-1 entry. gD, gH, gL, and gB can also mediate cell\u2013cell fusion of uninfected, receptor-bearing cells expressing these four glycoproteins. gD, gH, gL, and gB represent the core receptor-binding/fusogenic machinery of HSV-1. gD, gH, gL, gB, and a cellular receptor for gD are all that HSV-1 needs to enter any target cell. the presence of 11 additional envelope proteins (eight glycosylated and three unglycosylated) suggests they serve important roles during infection. gC and gG promote HSV-1 entry at the apical side of a polarized epithelial cell. entry at the basal side does not require either protein. these proteins may guide HSV-1 into the most efficient \u201centry lane\u201d. HSV-1 entry is an enigmatic process, and many questions remain. host factor\u2013specific interactions with HSV-1 envelope proteins seem to dictate the way HSV-1 enters a given cell. development of efficacious inhibitors and vaccines."}
