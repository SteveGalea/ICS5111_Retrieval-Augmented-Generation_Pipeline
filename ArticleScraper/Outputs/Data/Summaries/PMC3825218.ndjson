{"summary": "manganese is a trace element that has been extensively documented for its varied role in the body's homeostasis. it is required for the normal function and development of the brain [1], metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates [2\u20134] and also as a functional unit for many enzymes [3\u20135]. deficiencies that affect fetal development [6] and excess Mn (environmental exposure and/or elevated dietary Mn) can result in disorders and disease. mutagenicity of Mn has been extensively documented [19]. despite its mutagenicity, Mn is not classified as a carcinogen in humans. it is possible that redundant mechanisms of DNA repair exist. Yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) and synthetic complete (SC, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid, 0.087% amino acid mixture, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) media or the corresponding drop-out media were described in [28, 29]. the lys2-10A mutation reversion assay relies on the introduction of mutations on the CAN1 gene which encodes the arginine permease allowing mutant cells to grow on plates lacking lysine. the lys2-10A reversion assay relies on the introduction of mutations on the CAN1 gene which encodes the arginine permease. YKL114C Base excision repair UBC13 YDR092W DNA postreplication repair RAD30 YDR419W Bypass synthesis DNA polymerase NTG1 YAL015C Base excision repair Wild type: strain BY4741 (MATa his31 leu20 met150 ura30). RDKY3590 (MATa, ura3-52, leu2D1, trp1D63, hom3-10; lys210A single colonies were grown for 16 h on YPD with or without Mn2+ at 30\u00b0C with shaking. cell growth was monitored daily and sensitivity was scored after 3 days. each strain was tested using at least five independent colonies for each Mn2+ concentration. the CAN1 forward mutation assay relies on the introduction of mutations on the arginine permease allowing mutant cells to grow on plates lacking lysine. the lys2-10A reversion assay is based on the restoration of the open-reading frame in a mononucleotide run of 10 adenines within the lys2 allele of strain RDKY3590. DNA Sequence Analysis Spectrum analysis was carried out by selecting mutants (Canr) on selective minimum media drop-out plates containing canavanine [29]. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the mutants and the relevant region of CAN1 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. wild-type cells showed approximately 40% survival. sensitive strains showed higher sensitivity relative to the wild-type strain. survival was determined by counting the number of colonies in the respective dilutions. mutant strains ntg1 and hsp104 showed increased sensitivity to Mn2+. no significant difference was observed on the growth rate of each strain in the absence of Mn2+ (control panel), except for slow growing strain ntg1. all strains tested were sensitive to Mn2+ but only the hsp104 mutant displayed less sensitivity than the wild type (48% versus 37%; Figure 2(b), black bar). serial dilutions (1 : 10\u20131 : 105) of treated cultures were spotted on YPD plates. growth was scored after 3 days of incubation at 30\u00b0C. survival was determined by counting the number of colonies in respective dilutions. treatment with 1.5 mM Mn2+ and 10 mM GSH resulted in 74% survival. cotreatment with either NAC or GSH alone did not have an effect on the growth of ubc13 or wild-type strains. 20 mM NAC reduced the mutation rate by 1.5-fold (from 23.1 107 to 15.5 107), while 10 mM GSH reduced the mutation rate by 2-fold (from 23.1 107 to 11.8 107), consistent with the ability of these antioxidants to reduce Mn-induced toxicity. CAN1 forward mutation assay detects any mutation which inactivates the CAN1 gene (arginine permease) no complex mutations such as large deletions, insertions, duplications, or gross chromosomal rearrangements were found. some base substitution mutations were observed twice (G1196A, G1555A and A1417T; Table 2). cotreatment of the strain with 1.5 mM Mn2+ and 10 mM Mg2+ significantly increased the survival to 100%. the appearance of Lys+ revertant colonies indicates a mutator phenotype. mutant strains ntg1 and hsp104 were tested for growth on media after exposure to 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 mM Mn2+. a linear response in a narrow window between 1 and 2.5 mM. the higher concentration resulting in viability below 5%, which did not significantly increase at higher concentrations of Mn2+. no significant difference was observed on the growth rate of each strain in the absence of Mn2+ (control panel), except for slow growing strain ntg1. all strains tested were sensitive to Mn2+ but only the hsp104 mutant displayed less sensitivity than the wild type (48% versus 37%) sensitivity of the base excision repair mutants apn1, rad27, and ntg1 was 4.9%. ubc13 and rad30 mutants were also highly sensitive (4-fold higher than wild type), further suggesting the generation of Mn2+-induced DNA damage. the concentration of Mn2+ was increased to 2 mM to effectively determine the protective effects of the antioxidants on wild-type cells, resulting in 20% survival. cotreatment with 10 mM GSH increased survival to 44%, a 2-fold increase. the CAN1 forward mutation assay was performed using the wild-type strain in the presence of 1.5 mM Mn2+ or cotreated with 1.5 mM Mn2+ and 10 mM GSH. the assay detects any mutation which inactivates the CAN1 gene (arginine permease) and allows cells to grow on plates containing the toxic arginine analog, canavanine. CAN1 mutation spectrum of wild-type yeast exposed to Mn2+. a single mutation was identified in each isolate. the majority of the mutations were base-substitution mutations. the lys2-10A allele has a mononucleotide run of 10 adenines. the mutation rate increased by 13-fold (from 2.1 106 to 27.8 106) and was 30-fold (2.1 106 to 62.3 106) and 76-fold (2.1 106 to 160 106) higher (Figure 5(a)) cotreatment with 10 mM Mg2+ reduces accumulation of mutations on the lys2-10A allele induced by 1.5 mM Mn2+. each bar corresponds to the average of three sets of experiments using five independent colonies per set. manganese is an essential trace metal required for normal physiological function. all strains showed varying degrees of sensitivity, and all except the hsp104 strain, were more sensitive than the wild type, suggesting no significant toxic levels of protein aggregation are induced by Mn2+. cells possess recombination repair, which in yeast is primarily performed by homologous recombination (HR) replication repair pathway and rad30 mutants are defective in translesion synthesis DNA polymerase eta. NER does not appear to play a major role in the repair of Mn2+-induced DNA damage, as indicated by similar survival of rad2 mutant to the wild type. oxidative stress plays a major role in Mn2+ cytotoxicity. 10% of mutants analyzed had complex mutations [29, 45]. increase was dose-dependent and ameliorated by Mg2+. it is possible that the mutation rate increase is the result of Mn2+ intoxication by displacing Mg2+ [21], which would require MMR for repair. there is currently a lack of well-validated biomarkers for manganese exposure. there is currently no way to determine who will suffer severe effects after Mn overexposure."}
