{"summary": "the presence of a malignancy is considered to have a negative impact on the H1N1 disease severity, but there are few reports on clinical outcomes in cancer patients affected by the disease. there are no reports describing clinical characteristics of cancer patients with a severe form of the disease. the Instituto do cancer do Estado de So Paulo is an oncology reference hospital linked to the Universidade de Sao Paulo Medical School in Brazil. from June 2009 through November 2009, eight patients with cancer were admitted in its ICU due to severe H1N1 infection. rRT-PCR test used for bacteria identified DNA from haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. patients The Instituto do Cancer do Estado de So Paulo is an oncology reference hospital linked to the Universidade de Sao Paulo Medical School in Brazil. from June 2009 through November 2009, eight patients with cancer were admitted in its ICU due to severe H1N1 infection. autopsies Five patients who died had their autopsies performed in the department of pathology of the Universidade de Sao Paulo. tissue fragments were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and hematoxylin\u2013eosin stained. rRT-PCR test used for bacteria identified DNA from Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. myelofibrosis 1 (13) Chronic lymphocitic leukemia 1 (13) Multiple myeloma 1 (13) Solid neoplasm 5 (63) Breast cancer 1 (13) Prostate cancer 1 (13) Esophagus cancer 2 (25) Rectal melanoma 1 (13) Metastatic disease (yes/no) 4/8 Chemotherapy no. 1 (13) Presenting manifestations Cough 8 (100) Fever 8 (100) Myalgia 7 ( hypoxemia was present in 100% of cases, and four patients (50%) had oxygen saturation 90% at admission. Initially, lung disease was localized in one or two quadrants of lung (75%) but most patients developed a more extensive and progressive disease within 24 h of admission. invasive mechanical ventilation/noninvasive ventilation 5 (63) Timing of orotracheal intubation (h) related to ICU admission 1 (13) 0\u201324 3 (38) 24\u201348 0 (0) >48 1 (13) Respiratory and ventilatory variables in five mechanically ventilated patients 5 (100) PaO2/FiO2 200, median (range) 118 (64\u2013170) PEEP, median (range) 13 (10\u201320) Pressure-cycled ventilation 5 ( five patients (62.5%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation. four patients intubated in first 24 h of ICU and one 48 h after unsuccessful ventilation. computerized tomography revealed sparse bilateral infiltrates. in all patients, recruitment maneuvers were used with short-term improvements in oxygenation in three of five patients. despite the aforementioned ventilatory strategy, this particular group developed refractory persistent hypoxemia. most patients presented risk scores that predicted high-risk mortality. signs of tissue hypoxia as acidosis (median pH 7.2), high levels of lactate (median 4.2 mmol/l) and low levels of base excess (median 4.5 mEq/l) were noted in patients since admission until death. bacterial coinfection was diagnosed in seven patients. pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one case and due to S. pneumoniae in four other cases. one patient presented urinary tract infection due to Candida. autopsy findings An autopsy was performed in the five patients who died. all patients presented extensive pathological alterations in the lungs. lungs were heavy, diffusely edematous and with variable degrees of hemorrhage. only one of the five patients did not present acute interstitial changes. the bronchiole (Br) is partially filled with necrotic epithelial and inflammatory cells. the alveolar spaces (Alv) are filled with dense infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. five patients (62.5%) had solid neoplasms and three patients (37.5%) had hematological malignancies. the patient with myelofibrosis had been submitted to stem-cell transplantation 1 year ago. moptysis, rhinorrhea and wheezing were present in 25%. diarrhea was related by 12.5% of patients. all patients had fever or hypothermia and tachypnea. 0 (0) Number of quadrants with opacities in radiography after 24 h admission None 2 (25) One quadrant 3 (38) Two quadrants 3 (38) Three or four quadrants 0 (0) Number of quadrants with opacities in radiography after 24 h admission None 0 (0) One quadrant 1 (13) Two quadrants 2 (25) Three or four quadrants 5 (63) Timing of orotracheal intubation (h) related to ICU admission death 5 (63) days from ICU to death, median (range) 3 (1\u20138) S-OIV, swine-origin influenza A virus;

BE, base excess; BUN, blood urea nitrogen. pneumonia due to Enterococcus faecalis in one patient and pneumonia due to Candida. autopsy results An autopsy was performed in the five patients who died. seudomonas aeruginosa Negative Acute tubular necrosis, white pulp depletion in spleen, hypocellular bone marrow, lung thromboembolism 05/55 years. all patients presented extensive pathological alterations in the lungs. lungs were heavy, diffusely edematous and with variable degrees of hemorrhage. coinfection due to S. pneumoniae was confirmed at autopsy. photomicrographs show different patterns of pulmonary involvement. viral infections may represent up to 26% of the infections identified in cancer patients with pulmonary infiltrates. pneumonia was observed in 31% of the cases, and overall mortality was 15%. clinical outcomes in cancer patients with H1N1 infection have not been fully characterized yet. hematological conditions and H1N1 infection at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, with no reports of mortality or serious morbidities. the differences in outcomes may be related to specific characteristics of our population. most of the patients in this series developed bacterial coinfections. authors recommend patients should be managed with a low tidal volume open-lung strategy of ventilation, with PEEP titrated based on FiO2 to achieve adequate SpO2 and low Pplat [21, 22]. despite that there was no adequate response, all patients who required mechanically ventilated died with refractory hypoxemia and multiple organ failure. the presented incidence of 87% of bacterial coinfection might explain in part the high mortality rate of this group. biochemical and hematological data could not discriminate H1N1 infection from sepsis of bacterial origin in this group of patients. the importance of describing this serious form of disease in patients with cancer is to reinforce prevention strategies in this group, as to recommend vaccine, hygienic measures, prophylactic antiviral treatment in cases of contact and adequate isolation in cases of hospital admission due to H1N1 infection [30, 31]."}
