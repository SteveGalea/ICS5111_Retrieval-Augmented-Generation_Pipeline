{"summary": "supplementary information The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/ni.2965) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. supplementary information Integrated supplementary information Supplementary Figure 1. Generation and characterization of Ccl19-Cre Rosa26-eYFP mice. Lymph nodes from Ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice were collected and processed into single cell suspensions. Neutrophils (CD45+CD11b+Gr1\u2013/low) and dendritic cells (CD45+CD11c+MHCII+) were enumerated using flow cytometric analysis. NS non significant, * p0.01, **p0.001 Source data Supplementary Figure 4. ablation of FRCs disrupts the organization of splenic white pulp. NS non significant, *p0.05, **p0.01 Source data Supplementary Figure 5. peyer\u2019s patches are affected only marginally by the ablation of FRCs. stromal and B cells were enumerated using flow cytometry 72 h. each data point represents one lymph node from individual mice. CFSE-labeled B cells were seeded on top of a transwell insert. after that time, cells were recovered and B cells enumerated by flow cytometry. ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice were injected in the footpad with 0.5 ng/g DTxn. numbers of FRCs and B cells were determined by flow cytometry 72 h later. data are representative of two independent experiments. gene expression achieved in ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-eYFP mice. DTxn receptor gene is expressed following Cre-mediated recombination. data are normalized to cyclophillin. data are representative of at least three independent experiments (mean+/-sd, n=3 mice/group per experiment). NS non significant, *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001 Source data Supplementary Figure 3. Effects of the ablation of FRCs on T cells and B cells. the marginal zone humoral responses were assessed by determining antigen-specific IgM production via ELISA following TNP-ficoll immunization. the marginal zone humoral responses were assessed by determining antigen-specific IgM production via TNP-ficoll immunization. peyer\u2019s patches from Ccl19-Cre x Rosa26-EYFP mice stained for GFP, PDPN and RANK-L. scale bar 150 m (n=3 mice from two independent experiments) stromal and B cells were enumerated using flow cytometry 72 h after DTxn administration. CFSE-labeled B cells were seeded on top of a transwell insert and allowed to migrate towards the FRCs for 2 h. after that time, cells were recovered and B cells enumerated by flow cytometry. ccl19-Cre x iDTR mice were injected in the footpad with 0.5 ng/g DTxn. numbers of FRCs and B cells were determined by flow cytometry 72 h later."}
