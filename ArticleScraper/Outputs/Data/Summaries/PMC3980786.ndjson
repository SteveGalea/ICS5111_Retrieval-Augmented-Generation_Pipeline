{"summary": "influenza A virus causes significant morbidity and mortality and enormous economic losses annually in the world. some of the eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) have been shown to encode more than one polypeptide. autophagy is just one of such mechanisms involved in influenza A virus infection. growing evidence suggests that autophagy machinery has been used by certain viruses. autophagy, or \u201cself-eating\u201d, and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway are the two essential catabolic processes for eliminating superfluous and harmful proteins in eukaryotic cells. elongation and closure of isolation membrane are relevant to two ubiquitin-like systems. atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 system activated Atg12 conjugated to Atg5, which then interplayed with a coiled-coil protein Atg16L1. this protein could attach the complex to the outer membrane of phagophore. rapamycin TOR (mTOR) kinase is one of the most important inhibitory factors for autophagy. LC3-II is located throughout cytoplasm, but is redistributed after being recruited by the autophagic vesicles. characteristic punctate GFP-LC3 proteins accumulated both in rapamycin-treated and influenza A virus-infected cells. accumulation of membrane vesicles, which contain enveloped organelles and cellular contents, was identified in the infected cells by electron microscopists. viral HA protein inhibits apoptosis at the early stage of infection for viral replication. the NS1 contributes to increasing the synthesis of HA and M2. rapamycin TOR (mTOR) kinase is one of the most important inhibitory factors for autophagy. inactivation of mTOR leads to autophagy stimulation. rapamycin kinase is one of the most important inhibitory factors for autophagy. LC3 is located throughout cytoplasm, but is redistributed after being recruited by the autophagic vesicles. LC3-II stays with autophagosomes during autophagy, until the autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. the LC3-II level can be used to monitor autophagy process [15, 18] autophagy is stimulated in the influenza-infected cells at early stages of infection. NS1, a known multifunction protein of influenza A virus, has been reported to inhibit apoptosis at the early stage of infection for viral replication. the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome, resulting in the acidification of autolysosome which is concomitant with degradation of the inner autophagosome membrane. the viral proteins of influenza A virus induce both positive and negative regulation of the autophagy pathway. autophagosomes are known as transient vesicles which are soon degraded by lysosomes. the accumulation of influenza A virus-induced autophagosomes could represent either increased formation or reduced degradation of autophagosomes. accumulation of LC3-II is reduced in the uninfected cells. it suggests that the influenza A virus infection restricts the degradation of autophagosomes by lysosomal proteolysis at late stages of infection. the coimmunoprecipitation of M2 with Beclin-1 confirms this hypothesis. however, the molecular basis and precise role of interaction between M2 and Beclin-1 remain to be explored. pharmacological inhibition and genetic manipulation technique are frequently employed in autophagy inhibition. the inhibition of the PI3K can cause marked decrease in viral titers and protein abundance at the early stage of influenza A virus infection. this effect vanished at the late stage of infection. the PI3K inhibitor should not be employed for investigation of autophagy-related viral component accumulation during the initial infection. the levels of viral proteins, including HA, M1 and M2, are increased in the autophagy competent cells. autophagy is involved in regulating viral antigen accumulation in the influenza-infected cells. autophagy may contribute to reducing the antigenicity of influenza virus infection. NS1 interferes with apoptosis via targeting the protein kinase complex PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. the phosphorylated AKT only accumulated in the H1N1-infected cells. NS1 has a negligible effect on accumulation of mTOR in the cells. NS1 protein of influenza A virus may regulate autophagy via interaction with the PKR-eIF2 signaling pathway. apoptosis and autophagy may also trigger the death of host cells with little immunogenicity. osomes are presented at the terminal stage of infection, implying that the virus induces cell death without producing high immunogenicity. autophagy is initially known as a catabolic process for the recycling of the cytoplasmic macromolecules. however, this mechanism is exploited by influenza A virus for its own benefits."}
