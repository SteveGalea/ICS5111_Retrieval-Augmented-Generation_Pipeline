{"summary": "accessory protein 3b (also known as ORF4) was recently identified as one of the viral interferon antagonist. a new role for 3b might play an important role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. the current study aims at identifying novel host cellular interactors. acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread infected more than 8000 people. it was found to be associated with a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV. it is a positive sense, single-stranded enveloped RNA virus with a huge 29.7 Kb genome. the screen identified RUNX1b (Runt related transcription factor 1, isoform b) as one of the host interacting partners of 3b. RUNX1 belongs to the RUNX family of genes which includes RUNX2 and RUNX3 additionally [13] yeast two-hybrid screening of human lung cDNA library with full-length 3b as bait was conducted. clone encoding 51\u2013421 aa of Runt related transcription factor 1, isoform b (RUNX1b, accession no. NP_001001890) was obtained from the screening. pHybLexA/Zeo-3b scored positive for \u2013galactosidase filter lift assay. co-transformants of pHybLexA/Zeo and pYesTrp2 (bait plasmid with empty prey plasmid); and pYesTrp2-RUNX1b and pHybLexA/Zeo-Jun co-transformed yeast colonies were used as positive control. pHybLexA/Zeo, pYesTrp2, pHybLexA/Zeo-3b, pYesTrp2-RUNX1b, pYesTrp2-RUNX1b and pYesTrp2-Jun constructs were co-transformed in L40. in vitro translated S35-labelled 3b and RUNX1b lysates were subject to co-immunoprecipitation alone or immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag detected 3b from cells co-expressing RUNX1b and 3b (Lane 3, Fig. 1D) no band for 3b was seen from cells expressing RUNX1b or 3b alone. hek293 cells transfected with Flag-RUNX1b and HA-3b expression plasmids were subjected to immunofluorescence assay. 3b partially co-localizes with RUNX1b in the nucleus. cellular distribution of 3b and RUNX1b proteins were visualized. 3b was visualized using primary \u2013HA and alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody. 3\u2032-distal IL2 promoter region, which does not contain RUNX1 binding site, was not immunoprecipitated by anti-HA in either of the samples. results clearly demonstrate an in vivo recruitment of 3b on the RUNX1 binding element on the IL2 promoter. transfection in jurkat cells also showed 1.5\u20135.0 fold increase in the luciferase activity with increasing doses of Myc-3b. 3b dependent increase in the IL2 promoter activity relies on the RUNX1b transcription factor complex binding. 3b stimulates RUNX1b activity by inducing its ERK dependent phosphorylation RUNX1b transcriptional activity is regulated by various post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination etc. results depict 1.5 fold increase in phosphorylated RUNX1b levels in 3b transfected cells compared to control transfected cells. 3b expression increases phosphorylated RUNX1b levels through ERK activation. ERK immunoprecipitated from vector and 3b lysates were subjected to kinase assay with RUNX1b beads. X1b showed 3.0 fold increase in MIP-1 mRNA levels. those expressing 3b showed 5.0 fold increase as compared to vector. 3b and RUNX1b cooperatively increase MIP-1 mRNA levels. pYesTrp2-RUNX1b and pHybLexA/Zeo-Jun co-transformed yeast colonies were used as positive control. pYesTrp2-RUNX1b and pHybLexA/Zeo-Jun co-transformed yeast colonies were used as positive control. pYesTrp2-Jun constructs were co-transformed in L40. pHybLexA/Zeo-Fos and pYesTrp2-Jun were used as positive control. immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag detected 3b from cells co-expressing RUNX1b and 3b (Lane 3, Fig. 1D) no corresponding band for 3b was seen from cells expressing RUNX1b or 3b alone (Lane 1 and 2, Fig. 1D) 3b was visualized using primary \u2013HA and alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody. nuclei were visualized by DAPI (4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. Arrows indicate extra nucleolar nucleus area of partial co-localization. control ChIP assays using anti-RUNX1 (positive control) and no antibody (negative control) were conducted simultaneously. results clearly demonstrate an in vivo recruitment of 3b on the IL2 promoter. luciferase activity in HEK293 and jurkat cells was specific to the 3b expression. 3b stimulates RUNX1b activity by inducing its ERK dependent phosphorylation RUNX1b transcription. IL2 promoter with all three RUNX1 binding sites mutated (mutant IL2-Luc) was used. kinase assay performed with 3b and vector transfected HEK293 cells. results showed 1.5 fold increase in phosphorylated RUNX1b levels in 3b transfected cells compared to control transfected cells. ERK immunoprecipitated from vector and 3b lysates were subjected to kinase assay. input levels of immunoprecipitated ERK and phospho ERK levels in lysates were probed by western blotting. 3b and RUNX1b cooperatively increase MIP-1 mRNA levels. mRNA levels of MIP-1 to actin were estimated in U937 cells expressing indicated proteins. bar values represent fold increase in the mRNA levels. it is a most common target of chromosomal translocation in human leukaemias [16], [27] including acute myeloid leukaemia, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia [28], [29]. importantly, RUNX1b is involved in transcriptional regulation of several genes including cytokines and chemokines like IL2, IL3, GM-CSF, MIP-1, a comparative study by microarray analysis of host gene transcription in the Huh7 cell line infected with SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E found significantly increased RUNX1 expression with SARS-CoV infection as compared to human CoV22E [53]. this observation prompted us to study this novel interaction of SARS-CoV accessory protein 3b with RUNX1. 3b also affected its transactivation on the IL2 promoter by modulating phospho this is the first report unveiled the effect of SARS-CoV protein 3b on the transcriptional activity of a host transcription factor, RUNX1b. Upon entry in these cells, RNA genome of the SARS-CoV will get transcribed and translated and expectedly, would lead to the synthesis of 3b along with other proteins. however, until now there is no direct report on the expression levels of 3b in these virus infected cells. yeast Two-hybrid screening system (Hybrid hunter, version F) was constructed by cloning 3b coding sequence in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain in pHybLexA/Zeo. co-transformants were selected for the activation of two reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ. s were isolated from positive co-transformants and shuttled into E.Coli DH5. cell culture and transfection HEK293, human embryonic kidney cells and Huh7, human hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) images were collected using a 60 objective on a Nikon A-1Rconfocal microscope. co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting were expressed using a coupled in vitro transcriptional/translation system. 10\u201315106 cells were transfected with 10 g vector or 3b (pXJ40 HA-3b) plasmid. DNA fragments were analysed for the recruitment of RUNX1b and 3b on the IL2 promoter as well as on 5\u2032 distal region of the human IL2 gene. ase activity was expressed as meanstandard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. hek293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids of vector (control), 3b, and RUNX1b. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. RNA isolation and real time PCR RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primer and MuLV reverse transcriptase as per manufacturer's protocol. data is represented as bar graph and is meanSD of three independent observations. antibodies against RUNX1, HA and c-Myc were purchased from Santa Cruz. yeast Two-hybrid screening system comprised of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40. cDNA library cloned in pYesTrp2 was purchased from Invitrogen. cell culture and transfection HEK293, human embryonic kidney cells and Huh7, human hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM. all cell lines were maintained in media supplemented with 10% FCS (fetal calf serum, v/v) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) in vitro co-immunoprecipitation, [35S] radiolabelled full length RUNX1b and 3b were expressed using a coupled in vitro transcriptional/translation system as per manufacturer's protocol. immunocomplexes were precipitated by adding 50 l sepharose-A (50% v/v) beads at 4\u00b0C for 4\u20136 h. DNA fragments were analysed for the recruitment of RUNX1b and 3b on the IL2 promoter as well as on 5\u2032 distal region of the human IL2 gene (non-RUNX1 binding site) pEGFP-N1 plasmid was transfected as a negative control in cells not expressing 3b. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids of vector (control), 3b, and RUNX1b. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM -glycero g RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primer and MuLV reverse transcriptase as per manufacturer's protocol (Promega) data is represented as bar graph and is meanSD of three independent observations."}
