{"summary": "enteroviruses repress cellular translation, transcription and DNA replication during infection. enterovirus RNA contains a poly(A) tail, but does not contain the 5\u2032 m7GTP cap structure that is common to virtually all cellular mRNAs. poliovirus or CVB3 2A proteinase (2Apro) causes cleavage of eIF4GI and its paralog eIF4GII. eIF4G is the central scaffolding protein that assembles the cap-binding protein complex eIF4F on the cap structure on mRNA and bridges the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) to the small ribosomal subunit through an interaction with eIF3. the viral and cellular proteinases that cleave eIF4G separate the binding domain of eIF4G from the domain that binds eIF3 effectively enteroviruses promote then selectively block Cap-Independent Translation Enteroviruses use cap-independent translation facilitated by the large viral internal ribosome entry site structure. this structure has several stem loops and pseudoknots and serves to efficiently bind both canonical translation factors and other RNA binding proteins known as IRES-transactivating factors. eIF4G cleavage has the effect of releasing ribosomes, reducing competition for ribosomes by viral mRNA and promoting cap-independent translation on the viral IRES. 3Cpro cleaves three ITAFs that support IRES translation, PCBP2, PTB and La [24,25,26] ribosomes on existing viral polysomes can recycle similar to those on host mRNA polysomes. the result is a pool of viral RNA templates that are cleared of ribosomes and free to initiate RNA replication. cleavage of PABP has the same effect of restricting recycling and promoting template clearance. virus must be converted into a template free of ribosomes to enable RNA replication by viral RNA polymerase (moving in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction) 3Cpro cleaves three ITAFs that support IRES translation, PCBP2, PTB and La [24,25,26] cleavage occurs mid-phase in infection over a somewhat protracted phase. eIF4GI and PABP are cleaved during infection. eIF4GI and PABP can resist the general shutoff of translation exerted by eIF4GI cleavage. one ISG fights back to hinder viral control of translation directly. many viruses have evolved mechanisms to counter PKR and IFN activation. PV is relatively resistant to type 1 interferon treatment in vitro. it also causes partial degradation of PKR to limit stress responses. the 3Cpro cleavage site in eIF5B was mapped upstream of the conserved C-terminal domain that is homologous to IF2. in this way, PV generates a eukaryotic version of bacterial IF2 with a gain of function that promotes viral cap-independent translation long after eIF2 phosphorylation has shut down all other translation. a few RNA-binding proteins play critical roles in SG assembly and disassembly. the formation of SGs is seen as protective, enabling the cell to temporarily store a large variety of transcripts as the biochemical machinery reprograms. new insights have been gained in understanding how SGs form, thus providing new insights into how enteroviruses antagonize them. SGs are nucleated in two stages from numerous small cores containing highly condensed mRNPs formed with nucleating proteins such as G3BP1. RNA granules are not inert aggregates, rather foci of liquid phase condensates that display physical behaviors similar to liquid droplets. SGs are not homogenous in their makeup or density. enteroviruses poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) destroy RNA granule components through cleavage. this aspect makes enteroviruses useful probes to study functions of RNA granule components. formation of SGs is driven by 2Apro Cleavage of eIF4G and eIF2a Phosphorylation. SG assembly is promoted early in infection through depletion of met-tRNA ternary complexes. SG formation actually observed in PV or CVB3-infected cells is transient and quite variable. PV produces an inhibitory activity that blocks the stress granule response that mobilizes in response to exogenous stressors. infection with CVB3 or EV71 also results in cleavage and disassembly of SGs. a more distantly related cardiovirus also cleaves G3BP1 during infection of human cells. this evolutionary conservation attests to the importance of G3BP1 in SG assembly mechanism. other critical functions of G3BP1 may be uncovered in the future. expression of mutated cleavage-resistant G3BP1 in cells can preserve or restore SG formation during infection. despite much progress, the mechanistic role of G3BP1 in SG formation is still poorly understood. no RNAseq data are available to determine to what extent G3BP1, G3BP2, Tia1, TDP-43 or other SG nucleating proteins are bound to unique or overlapping sets of mRNAs. production of G3BP1 cleavage fragments may be more important than the loss of intact G3BP1 through the production of dominant negative inhibitors. eIF4GI cleavage fragments can assemble into normal SGs in PV-infected cells. expression of 2Apro in cells was able to partly repress arsenite-induce SGs, though not as stringently as expression of 3Cpro, which cleaves G3BP1. a role for any ITAF in SG dynamics has not been proposed. TMEV represses SGs, but does not cleave human G3BP1. another cardiovirus, EMCV, blocks SGs in HeLa cells via cleavage of G3BP1 at the same site cleaved by PV 3Cpro. stress will activate one or more of the eIF2 kinases (PKR, HRI, GCN2, PERK), promote translation inhibition through eIF2 phosphorylation, and lead to accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes. other pathways exist that promote SG formation without upstream eIF2-phosphorylation. mRNP transport on microtubules requires protein-protein phase condensation functions of key nucleating proteins. PTMs occur on a set of key proteins that play nucleating roles in SG formation. RNA granules are not inert aggregates, rather foci of liquid phase condensates that display physical behaviors similar to liquid droplets. enteroviruses antagonize RNA granules strongly, and this type of antagonistic relationship with RNA granules is common in other mammalian virus families. enteroviruses poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) destroy RNA granule components through cleavage. this aspect makes enteroviruses useful probes to study functions of RNA granule components. enterovirus infection is well known to activate PKR and drive accumulation of phospho-eIF2. so, SG assembly is also promoted early in infection through depletion of met-tRNA ternary complexes. PV produces an inhibitory activity that blocks the stress granule response that mobilizes in response to exogenous stressors. G3BP1 is cleaved by PV 3Cpro, which separates the major protein-interaction motifs (NTF2-acidic-PxxP) from the RNA-binding RRM portion of the protein. infection with CVB3 or EV71 also results in G3BP1 cleavage and disassembly of SGs. this evolutionary conservation attests to the importance of G3BP1 in SG assembly mechanism. cleavage of only G3BP1 by PV is associated with complete loss of SG formation. despite much progress, the mechanistic role of G3BP1 in SG formation is still poorly understood. G3BP1 recruits a larger fraction of the cell mRNPs than other SG-nucleating proteins. the number of binding targets is unknown, but may be numerous. a final hypothesis is that production of G3BP1 cleavage fragments may be more important than the loss of intact G3BP1 through the production of dominant negative inhibitors. cleavage of eIF4G by 2Apro was proposed to interfere with SG assembly. however, expression of 2Apro in cells was able to partly repress arsenite-induce SGs. a role for any ITAF in SG dynamics has not been proposed. theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) represses SGs, but does not cleave G3BP1. another cardiovirus, EMCV, blocks SGs in HeLa cells via cleavage of G3BP1 at the same site cleaved by PV 3Cpro. granules may sequester significant portions of small ribosomal subunits into compartments inaccessible to virus RNAs. the virus RNAs themselves may be sequestered into SGs and PBs. emerging evidence suggests that SGs serve as signaling platforms to trigger aspects of innate immunity. many innate immune activators and downstream ISGs can be found in SGs formed during influenza virus infection and depletion of G3BP1 or PKR reduces IFN mRNA production. one way that SG formation may activate innate immunity is by concentrating key proteins, thereby increasing interactions between PRRs, their targets, and signaling molecules. PKR can be recruited to SGs induced by influenza virus infection or after its activation with dsRNA. the granules induced by G3BP1 in the absence of virus infection can assemble OAS and RNase L into SGs similar to influenza virus-induced SGs. the findings elucidate a new PKR activation pathway that is dependent on G3BP1 incorporation into SGs. granules induced by G3BP1 overexpression are antiviral against multiple enteroviruses. the granules induced by G3BP1 in the absence of virus infection can assemble OAS and RNase L into SGs similar to influenza virus-induced SGs. the granules induced by G3BP1 are antiviral against multiple enteroviruses [64,75] PKR activation occurs during SG assembly and then it is released from the G3BP1 complex located within SGs to cycle back to the cytoplasm to interact with its substrates. these findings elucidate a new PKR activation pathway that is dependent on G3BP1 incorporation into SGs. SGs can operate as signaling platforms to activate innate immunity. enteroviruses destroy host defense and gene expression mechanisms through multiple targets of 2Apro and 3Cpro. PBs lack 40S ribosome subunits and translation factors but are enriched in RNA decay machinery. viral mRNA is at risk for 5\u2032 end mediated degradation. PV replication results in cleavage/degradation of two factors, Dcp1a and Xrn1. in uninfected cells Dcp1a trimerization promotes decapping of mRNA. Xrn1 is the major 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease involved in mRNA decay. 2Apro does not cleave host proteins currently thought to aid PB assembly. oxidative stress promotes PB assembly in cells where 2Apro was expressed. in cells expressing 3Cpro, PBs could not be rescued by oxidative stress. eIF2 phosphorylation induced by Dcp1a expression indicates novel signaling crosstalk exists between RNA decay, translation regulation, and innate immunity. crosstalk exists between one PB component and PKR that can block enterovirus infection. a surprising target for PV since enterovirus RNAs are never capped. the emerging crosstalk between stress, innate immunity and inflammation suggests future novel strategies to control stress-triggers of autoimmune disease and other non-viral diseases."}
