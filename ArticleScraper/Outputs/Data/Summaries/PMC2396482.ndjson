{"summary": "liquiritigenin and its component, liquiritigenin, could inhibit cadmium (Cd)-induced toxicity in a rat-derived hepatocyte cell line (3). chronic exposure to arsenic can cause severe jaundice, liver cirrhosis (12,13), ascites and cancer. arsenic is present in both pentavalent arsenate and trivalent arsenite. trivalent arsenite is known to be more toxic than pentavalent arsenate. caspase-3 is a critical step in apoptosis. the amount of licorice water extract was estimated by the dried weight of lyophilized water extract of G. radix. the yield of lyophilized licorice from G. radix was 13%. cells were harvested, washed in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA and 1% NP-40. caspase-3 cleavage requires proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 into activated p17 and p12 fragments. cells were washed with PBS and 0.5 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (Cell signaling, MA, USA) after which 1 mM PMSF was added to each plate (100 mm) on ice. the amount of licorice water extract was estimated by the dried weight of lyophilized water extract of G. radix. the yield of lyophilized licorice from G. radix was 13%. viable cells were stained with MTT (0.5 mg ml1, 4 h) the media were then removed and formazan crystals produced in viable cells were dissolved by adding 200 l of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Titertek Multiskan Automatic ELISA microplate reader (Model MCC/340, Huntsville, AL, USA) cleaved caspase-3 Assay Caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptosis. cells were pre-treated with licorice for 12 h, then incubated with 400 M of As. cells were scraped off the plate, sonicated on ice and microcentrifuged for 10 min. a significant increase in cell death was observed upon exposure to 800 M As. cytotoxicity was observed after as treatment (200 and 400 M) for 12, 18 and 24 h. licorice treatment suppressed As-induced cell death. cell viability was restored to 92% of the control group. the population was separated into three groups: live cells showing only a low level of fluorescence, apoptotic cells showing both red and green fluorescence (A) and the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic death cell (B) was calculated. results from an additional DNA experiment with As-exposed cells showed that As induced a typical DNA laddering effect indicating apoptosis. the cells were lysed and the total cell lysate was applied to cleaved caspase-3 sandwich ELISA kit (Cell signaling, MA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. data represent the mean SD of three separate experiments. cells exposed to 200 and 400 M of As for 0\u201324 h. cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. data represent the mean SD of eight separate experiments. licorice reducing the apoptotic population to only 1.73%. results provided strong evidence that licorice effectively inhibits Cd- or As-induced cytotoxicity. H4IIE cells that had been pre-treated with licorice for 12 h were further incubated with licorice + As (400 M) for another 12 h. the cells were lysed and the total cell lysate was applied to cleaved caspase-3 sandwich ELISA kit. liquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid are the major constituents. licorice and liquiritigenin prevented Cd-induced apoptosis, and non-apoptotic cell death, irrespective of sulfhydryl deficiency. licorice prevented Cd-induced toxicity in H4IIE cells (3). licorice significantly inhibited apoptosis at lower concentration or necrosis at high concentration in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. licorice inhibited caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6) and reduced the population of apoptotic cells. caspase-3 activation was inhibited by both 0.1 and 1.0 mg ml1 of licorice. net cell viability by 1.0 mg ml1 of licorice was much higher than that by 0.1 mg ml1 of licorice."}
