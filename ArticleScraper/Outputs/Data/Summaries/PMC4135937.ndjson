{"summary": "arenavirus infection is mediated by the viral glycoprotein complex (GPC), which is cleaved into three segments by a signal peptidase and SKI-1/S1P. at 58 amino acids in length, the arenavirus SSP is two to four times longer than most viral signal peptides. enfuvirtide is a peptide inhibitor of viral fusion. it associates with exposed NHR to prevent stable 6-HB formation. fusion inhibitors of similar design have been reported for coronaviruses. ulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. human cytomegalovirus (CMV; TR strain) was obtained from Daniel Streblow (Oregon Health & Science University) Viruses (50 PFU/well) were incubated in serum-free DMEM 1 h at 37\u00b0C. peptide inocula were added to washed monolayers and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C prior to removal. monolayers were incubated for 2 (VSV, VACVJUNV, VACVMACV, and MV) fected cells were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot plate reader. total protein was precipitated from clarified supernatant by the addition of 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (wt/vol) and 1% NaCl (wt/vol) with gentle stirring overnight at 4\u00b0C. pellets were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) extrusion through two stacked 0.4-mm-pore-size nuclepore polycarbonate membranes followed by extrusion through two stacked 0.1-mm-pore-size membranes. the latter step repeated a total of 10 times in a lipex biomembranes extruder. fluorescence emission spectra were obtained over 565 to 635 nm. percentage dequenching at 582 nm was calculated by the following equation: 100(Ft F0)/(FTriton F0) unbound virus was removed by four washes with cold PBS. 2.5 ml cold imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, and 2% FBS) was added to the dish. 1,6-Diphenylhexatriene (DPH; Invitrogen) or 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH;Invitrogen) in dimethylformamide was incorporated into liposomes by 90 min of incubation at RT in the dark. peptides were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as 5 mM stock solutions. vero cells and human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM. cytopathic effects were observed (2 to 6 days) vero cells or HFF in phenol red-free minimal essential medium were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 5 104 cells/well. cells were seeded at a density of 2.75 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and incubated for 24 h to produce confluent monolayers. peptide inocula were added to washed monolayers and allowed to adsorb for 1 h prior to removal. plaques were immunostained 24 h postinfection with mouse anti-CMV immediate early antigen 1/2 antibody (Millipore), rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Dako) total numbers of infected cells were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) plate reader. PICV was purified by methods adapted from Neuman et al. (15) 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC; Avanti Polar Lipids) in chloroform was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and lyophilized overnight to remove all traces of solvent. the lipid film was hydrated with PBS to a POPC concentration of 10 mM. solution was acidified by the addition of predetermined volumes of 1 or 0.1 N HCl. final volume in the cuvette was 250 l. fluorescence emission spectra were obtained over 565 to 635 nm. purified PICV (50 g) was treated with 5 M 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-conjugated peptide for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate was added at a concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 mM and incubated at RT for 30 min. the cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 50 mM Tris (pH 6.8) for 15 min at RT. protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. an initial screen of peptide candidates with significant interfacial hydrophobicity identified several with antiviral activity. a 19-mer designated AVP-p was determined to inhibit PICV with a 50% inhibitory dose (IC50) of 7.05 2.19 M. no significant loss of viability was observed in vero cells or HFF. the peptide was tested against TAMV, VACV expressing JUNV or MACV GPC, VSV, CMV, and MV. helix is depicted in a PyMol rendering of the PICV postfusion GP2 ectodomain. CD spectra for AVP-p and scrambled peptides in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) showing the random-coil structure. Peptide-induced fusion of PICV and liposomes. labeled virus incubated with liposomes and 5 or 50 M peptide at pH 7.4 exhibited approximately 24% or 54% dequenching, respectively, after 1 h. the label was stable once incorporated into viral membranes, with only 5% dequenching over the duration of the experiment. untreated control samples showed pleiomorphic, spherical virions with distinct glycoprotein spikes. incubation at pH 5.0 yielded particles lacking visible glycoprotein spikes. loss of prefusion spike structure is indicative of GP1 dissociation. R18-labeled purified PICV was incubated with peptide and bound to cells by spinoculation. cells were imaged live and in ice-cold buffer to prevent endocytosis and fusion. incubation with AVP-p reduced but did not eliminate overall binding of individual virions. cross-linking by glutaraldehyde failed to reveal peptide-glycoprotein binding. the specificity of BS3 for primary amine groups was not a limiting factor in this experiment. an SDS-PAGE gel is shown following colloidal Coomassie staining. the peptides have similar effects on model and viral membranes. the latter are intrinsically more rigid due to their protein and cholesterol content. neither scrambled version of AVP-p extensively altered DPH anisotropy. monolayers were exposed to approximately 50 PFU PICV and peptide together without preincubation for 1 h. inhibitory activity was certainly lower when virus was not pretreated with peptide prior to incubation with cells. no significant antiviral activity or increase in viral infectivity versus the control was observed. complete inhibition of plaque formation occurred in the presence of approximately 20 M peptide. the range for IC50s was approximately 2 to 10 M. the peptide was tested against TAMV, VACV expressing JUNV or MACV GPC. CD spectroscopy revealed that the hydrophobic peptide formed a random coil in solution. the less-inhibitory scrambled peptides adopted random-coil conformations in buffer. at 10% TFE, however, AVP-p remained a random coil. the kinetics of PICV dequenching are in good agreement with the results of Di Simone et al. (17) for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) fusion. lengthening the incubation time with each incremental pH decrease did not affect the extent of dequenching. when AVP-p was incubated with R18-labeled virus, we observed extensive dequenching in the sample at pH 7.4 prior inactivated virus was preincubated at pH 5.0 prior to labeling. incubation at pH 5.0 yielded particles lacking visible glycoprotein spikes. disappearance of prefusion glycoprotein spikes was observed in samples incubated with peptide. low-pH-treated virions showed a trend toward diameters larger than those seen with untreated PICV. Peptide-treated PICV showed an even more substantial shift toward larger particles, suggesting more extensive fusion with peptide treatment. cells were imaged live in ice-cold buffer to prevent internalization and fusion of virus. large puncta (>1 m2) were excluded from particle counts as aggregates. interaction of peptide and GPC ectodomains. fluorescent lipid probes DPH and TMA-DPH were used to monitor lipid ordering. GP2 peptide289\u2013307 (PGGYALEQWAIIWAGIKAF) corresponds to the fusion peptide region. the presence of peptide in the cuvette has no inherent effect on anisotropy values. lipophilic probes TMA-DPH and DPH were incorporated into POPC large unilamellar vesicles and purified PICV membranes. bilayer rigidity was assessed following incubation with increasing concentrations of peptide. GP2 peptide289\u2013307, derived from the distal fusion peptide region of GP2, served as a positive control, while a non-membrane-interacting GP1-derived peptid increase in viral infectivity versus the control was observed, suggesting that endocytosis and fusion occur in less time than is required for the peptide to impact the process significantly. assays reveal specific in vitro antiviral activity in the low micromolar range. a peptide corresponding to the PICV CHR showed no significant antiviral activity at 100 M, suggesting its binding site may not be exposed prior to GP2 activation. a peptide corresponding to the PICV CHR exhibited no significant antiviral activity at 100 M, suggesting its binding site may not be exposed prior to GP2 activation. GP2 peptide289\u2013307 induces substantially lower degree of acyl chain packing. the scrambled versions of AVP-p have little effect on the membrane core at any concentration. the effects of peptide treatment on viral ultrastructure are comparable to but less encompassing than those of exposure to low pH. the association of bilayer-spanning helices renders arenaviruses uniquely sensitive to membrane-perturbing agents. work by York and Nunberg implicates the membrane-proximal region of GP2 and the SSP ectodomain loop as a principal site of arenavirus fusion initiation."}
