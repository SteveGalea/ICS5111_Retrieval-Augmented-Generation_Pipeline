{"summary": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism of eukaryotic posttranscriptional gene regulation mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced sequence-specific RNA degradation. it is also well known to exert as an important antiviral defense mechanism in a wide range of organisms, from plants to invertebrates. rinkle virus P38 and cauliflower mosaic virus P6 disrupt RNAi machinery. flock house virus (FHV) B2 blocks RNAi by dsRNA binding (16, 17), and Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) B2 was identified as a VSR by targeting both dsRNAs and Dicer-2 (18, 19). the nucleocapsid (N) protein is a basic protein (with typical pIs of 10) and has nonspecific binding activity toward nucleic acids. it encapsulates viral genomic RNA (gRNA) to protect the genome and enters the host cell together with the viral RNA to facilitate its replication. inhibition activity was unable to promote the replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) compared to the wild-type N protein. knockdown of Dicer1 or Ago2 enhanced MHV replication. plasmid eGFP-C1 was used to express enhanced green fluorescent protein. the eGFP reporter gene and the FHV B2 were constructed into the insect expression vector pAc5.1/V5-HisB. nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) cloned in pAc5.1/V5-HisB was inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pAc5.1/V5-HisB. HEK293T cells were seeded on 12-well dishes and grown overnight to reach 50% confluence, followed by transfection with standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. blots were exposed to luminescent image analyzer LAS4000 (Fuji Film) agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel with 7 M urea. the separated RNAs were then cross-linked by exposure to UV light. blots were exposed to luminescent image analyzer LAS4000 (Fuji Film) the coding sequences of SARS-CoV N protein and WhNV B2 were PCR amplified and inserted into the BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1. the bacterial pellet was lysed with lysis buffer, followed by incubation at 16\u00b0C for 12 h. reaction mixtures were separated on 1.2% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE)\u2013agarose gel. 0.2 pmol of 5\u2032Hex-labeled siRNA was incorporated into the reaction. the reaction mixtures were separated using 4% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the plasmid eGFP-C1 (Clontech) was used to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) the plasmid eGFP-C1 (Clontech) was used to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) the open reading frame 6 expression plasmid with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was provided by Stanley Perlman. the coding sequences of MERS-CoV N protein were chemically synthesized and cloned into the pCMV-tag2b vector. siRNAs targeting mouse Dicer1 and Ago2 were obtained from Qiagen. human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T), mouse Neuro-2a cells (gifts from Yan Zhou) and L2 cells (gifts from Rong Ye) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. the blots were exposed to luminescent image analyzer LAS4000 (Fuji Film) the antibodies used here were as follows: anti-actin (Proteintech Group), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-eGFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2,000), anti-flag and anti-HA (Sigma; 1:5,000), and anti-Myc (Roche; 1:2,000). otides 1 to 500 (for experiments in mammalian cells) or 501 to 720 (for experiments in insect cells) the probe for detection of eGFP shRNA and siRNA specifically targets the B2 coding region from nt 2738 to nt 3058. we generated 244-bp DIG-labeled dsRNA, 500-bp dsRNA, and 500-nt ssRNA by in vitro transcription using DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche) each assay was performed in a 20-l reaction system containing 0.2 pmol of DIG-labeled 500-bp dsRNA and RNase III (Invitrogen) as described previously (19). m concentrations of either GST, GST-WhNV B2 or GST-N were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the reaction mixtures were resolved by 1.2% TBE\u2013agarose gel electrophoresis. resulting file was transferred to GENDOC to prepare for graphic figures. SYBR green master mix (Roche) was used for real-time PCR. mouse GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) mRNA was used as an internal control. RESULTS Identification of coronaviral N protein as a VSR. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding eGFP reporter (125 ng), eGFP-specific shRNA (shGFP) (1 g), or luciferase-specific shRNA (shLuc) and viral protein of SARS-CoV (500 ng), respectively. eGFP expression level was determined by Western blotting at 72 h posttransfection. the presence of N protein restored the endogenous VHL expression silenced by VHL-specific shRNA (shVHL), whereas the VHL expression level was not affected in mock vector (pLko.1)-transfected cells. we further confirmed the VSR activity of SARS-CoV N protein using FHV RNA1 replication system (Fig. 2G) the indicated coronavirus N proteins inhibited shRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding eGFP reporter (125 ng), shGFP, or shLuc (1 g) and plasmids encoding viral proteins as indicated (300 ng) cells were transfected with 0.03 g of pFR1 or 0.6 g of pFRNA1-B2 and with SARS-CoV N or FHV B2 as indicated above. at 48 h posttransfection, the cellular total mRNA was harvested for Northern blot analysis by a probe recognizing FHV RNA1 and RNA3. reversal of eGFP silencing could be observed as early as 24 h posttransfection. increased amounts of the plasmid expressing SARS-CoV N protein were transfected into HEK293T cells. eGFP expression was more effective at 48 and 72 h posttransfection. the decrease in eGFP expression and its mRNA level in HEK293T cells was partially inhibited in the presence of SARS-CoV N protein comparing with NoV B2. the presence of SARS-CoV N protein abolished the eGFP-specific RNAi induced by dsRNA (dsRNA-GFP) while remarkably inhibiting the siGFP-induced RNAi in both mammalian and insect cells. eGFP expression plasmid (200 ng) was cotransfected with multiple concentrations (5 to 40 nM) of synthetic eGFP-specific siRNA (siGFP) to confirm the effective siGFP concentration in HEK293T cells. at 72 h after transfection, cell lysates were harvested to determine the reduction in eGFP expression by Western blotting. to investigate the mechanism of N protein as a VSR, we used a gel shift assay after the incubation of recombinant GST-tagged SARS-CoV N protein (GST-N) and WhNV B2 (GST-B2) with DIG-labeled 500-nt ssRNA, DIG-labeled 244-bp dsRNA, and synthetic 5\u2032-hexachlorofluorescein phosphoramidite (HE protection of GST-N or GST-B2 was digested into 21-to 23-nt siRNA. dsRNA could directly bind dsRNA to prevent the digestion of Dicer. dsRNA inhibits the dicer-like RNase III cleavage reaction in vitro. positively charged residues Lys 258 and Lys 262 of SARS-CoV N protein are critical for the RNAi repression activity. mutations of conserved Lys 258 and lysine were analyzed by the reversal-of-silencing assay in HEK293T cells. positively charged residues Lys 258 and Lys262 of SARS-CoV N protein abolished its ability to repress RNAi induced by shRNA in HEK293T cells. these results support the importance of the RNA-binding activity of protein N in RNAi suppression. coronavirus MHV strain A59 belongs to the same virus group as SARS-CoV. the multiple functional N protein is essential for coronavirus. the expression of N protein either in cis or in trans could facilitate the viral replication. K258/262A mutant could not promote MHV growth. but 300 ng of wild-type N protein could still enhance virus replication. deficiency of K258/262A mutant in VSR activity was not due to reduced expression level. IFN- production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) total RNAs were extracted from the transfected cells as described in panel B and subjected to RT-PCR to detect Ifn- and Isg56 mRNA. no reduction in mRNA level of Isg56 observed in presence of SARS-CoV N protein. MHV replication may be sensitive to RNAi-mediated antiviral response. mRNA levels of Dicer1 and Ago2 were markedly reduced. the differences of MHV replication promotion between wild-type SARS-CoV N protein and mutant K285/262A of SARS-COV N protein observed in neuro-2a cells were eliminated in RNAi knockdown cells by siDicer1 or siAgo2 respectively. both healthy and RNAi pathway-deficient L2 cells could produce high levels of IFN- (up to 10,000 pg/ml) in RNAi-competent L2 cells, N protein could significantly increase mouse Neuro-2a cells were transfected with 40 nM siDicer1 (A and B) or siAgo2 (C and D) at 48 h posttransfection, total cellular mRNAs were extracted and subjected to RT-PCR to determine the indicated mRNA levels. the data were normalized to the abundance of internal mouse GAPDH mRNA. cells were transfected with MHV or SeV. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with MHV or SeV. at 16 h postinfection, the cells were infected with MHV or SeV. SARS-CoV N showed relatively higher VSR activity in the reversal-of-silencing assay. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding eGFP reporter (125 ng), eGFP-specific shRNA (shGFP) (1 g), or luciferase-specific shRNA (shLuc) and viral protein of SARS-CoV (500 ng), respectively. nsp14 with nonspecific RNA binding activity (49) and ORF6 protein with IFN antagonistic activity (50) were used as negative controls. transfection of the N expression plasmid remarkably resurrected the expression of RNAi-silenced eGFP at both protein and mRNA levels. pRNA1-B2 failed to accumulate FHV RNA1 and RNA3. defect could be partially rescued by cotransfection with plasmids expressing SARS-CoV N protein or FHV B2. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids of mock vector pLko.1 (1 g) or shRNA targeting endogenous gene VHL (shVHL) at 72 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting to determine the endogenous VHL expression. increasing amounts of SARS-CoV N were transfected into HEK293T cells. the reversal effect of eGFP silencing increased progressively at both protein and mRNA levels, along with the gradual increase of the transfected plasmid. the results showed that the reversal of eGFP silencing could be observed as early as 24 h posttransfection. decrease in eGFP expression and its mRNA level in HEK293T cells was partially inhibited in the presence of SARS-CoV N protein comparing with noV B2. this phenomenon is consistent with the eGFP expression and its mRNA level observed in the reversal-of-silencing assays. ethidium bromide-stained gel of low-molecular-weight RNA shown as loading control. eGFP expression plasmid (200 ng) was cotransfected with multiple concentrations (5 to 40 nM) of synthetic eGFP-specific siRNA (siGFP) to confirm the effective siGFP concentration in HEK293T cells. dsRNA directly binds to RNAs and prevents dsRNA from cleavage in vitro. a number of VSRs could sequester RNA duplexes from Dicer cleavage. we used a gel shift assay after incubation of recombinant GST-tagged SARS-CoV N protein (GST-N) and WhNV B2 (GST-B2) 500-bp dsRNA formed a high-molecular-weight complex with GST-N, as well as GST-B2. without the protection of GST-N or GST-B2, dsRNA was digested into 21-to 23-nt siRNA. N protein binds to RNAs and inhibits the dicer-like RNase III cleavage reaction in vitro. the reaction products were separated on 1.2% TBE\u2013agarose gel. the free dsRNA is indicated on the left side, and the cleaved dsRNA is indicated on the right side. positively charged residues Lys 258 and Lys 262 of SARS-CoV N protein are critical for RNAi repression activity. conserved arginine and lysine were analyzed by a reversal-of-silencing assay in HEK293T cells. mutations of conserved Lys 258 and Lys262 in CTD of N protein abolished its ability to repress RNAi induced by shRNA in HEK293T cells. these results support the importance of the RNA-binding activity of protein N in RNAi suppression. a reversal-of-silencing assay analyzed the RNAi repression activity of flag-tagged mutants of SARS-CoV N protein. the mutants were further analyzed based on the results from panel E. coronavirus MHV strain A59 belongs to the same virus group as SARS-CoV. the effect of SARS-CoV N protein on the enhancement of MHV growth was also dose dependent, a finding consistent with previous observation. however, the mutant K258/262A could not promote MHV growth, but 300 ng of wild-type N protein could still enhance virus replication. neuro-2a cells were infected with MHV strain A59 at an MOI of 0.1 or transfected with 2 g of poly(IC) at 16 h postinfection or transfection, IFN- production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mRNA levels of Ifn- and Isg56 are neither reduced compared. mRNA levels of dicer1 and Ago2 were markedly reduced in mice. mRNA levels of dicer1 and Ago2 were markedly reduced in cells transfected with siDicer1-6 and siAgo2-4 respectively. mRNA levels of dicer1 and Ago2 were markedly reduced in cells transfected with siDicer1-6 and siAgo2-4 respectively. mRNA level of Isg56 increased to some extent, whereas replication of MHV was still promoted in Ago2-knockdown cells. differences of MHV replication promotion between wild-type SARS-CoV N protein, noV B2, and mutant K285/262A of SARS-COV N protein observed in neuro-2a cells. RNAi pathway was involved in anticoronavirus response in mammalian cells. mouse neuro-2a cells were transfected with 40 nM siDicer1 (A and B) or siAgo2 (C and D) at 48 h posttransfection, total cellular mRNAs were extracted and subjected to RT-PCR to determine the mRNA levels of Dicer1 (A), Ago2 (C) and Ifn- (B and D) total RNAs were extracted from the transfected cells and subjected to RT-PCR to determine the indicated mRNA levels. MHV titers were determined by plaque assay. the data were normalized to the abundance of mouse mRNA. coronavirus has the largest single-stranded genomic RNA and abundant sgRNAs and dsRNA intermediates (29\u201331, 61), which may be result of cooperative binding of multiple N protein monomers. we propose a hypothesis that the coronavirus N protein might protect viral RNA from RNAi-mediated gene silencing. coronavirus N protein suppresses RNAi in mammalian cells. the single-stranded genomic RNA (gRNA) is protected by N proteins. it serves as a template for the synthesis of negative-strand gRNA and a set of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) the three distinct and highly conserved domains of N proteins (NTD, SRD, and CTD) could bind with viral RNAs in different coronaviruses. the NTD has been found to associate with a stem-loop structure located at the 3\u2032 end of RNA genome. the critical residues Lys 258 and Lys 262 of SARS-CoV N protein for VSR are located in the positively charged groove of CTD. in primary cells, IFN is induced by MHV infection in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages (57, 72, 73), but not in neurons, astrocytes, and hepatocytes (57, 72, 73) we also tested the VSR activity of N protein in IFN-deficient insect cells (Fig. 2G) MHV replication is sensitive to the RNAi-mediated antiviral response. there has been no direct evidence for existence of coV-derived siRNAs in mammalian cells."}
